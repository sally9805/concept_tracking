 | old leather , and bones . His clothes was some tore up and all bloody . Pa , he stood there looking down at him a long time . " Do n't seem logical , " he said , at last . " What 's that , Pa ? " " Indians most usually take a body 's clothes . They ai n't taken nothin ' from him . " " His pockets is inside out . " " I was seein ' that , boy . It do make a body think . " He turned . " Boy , you run out to the wagon an ' git my shovel . We got a buryin ' to see to . " He stepped around the body and pushed wide the cabin door . That door had been half-open , and Pa looked in like he feared what he might see , but like I said , there was n't nothin ' to fear . When I come in later I saw just what he saw .

Pa always said you could tell a man who loved wood by the way things were fitted and dressed , nothing halfway , but smooth and nicely done . Pa could n't do that sort of work himself , but he had admiration for it , and it made me feel like working at it until I was good . If fine work impressed Pa so much there must be something to it . " I never had no craft , boy . I worked hard all my life but never had no craft . Just a few slights I picked up handling heavy things and the like . I do admire a man who does fine work .

I never did know how Pa come to so much knowing of the Book , because I never did see him reading much in it . We filled in the grave an ' Pa said , " Come tomorrow we 'll make him a marker . " " How 'll you know what to say ? We ai n't sure who he is . " " No , we ai n't . But they do call this the Chantry place , so I reckon his name must be that . " Pa stopped there , leaning on his shovel , like . " What 'll we do now , Pa ? It 's late to be startin ' on . " " This here 's it , son . This place here . We ai n't goin ' no further . You know , son , I ai n't been much of a success in my time . Fire burned me out back to home , and we lost everything .

He could ride over land at a gallop and tell you which was best , but me , I was a all-fired smart youngster and no old men was going to tell me anything . I just knowed it all already . So I never learned . " Son , I got to admit it . Ever ' piece of land I picked was poor . Sure , we lost out to grasshoppers , hail , and the like , but those places never would have made it no way . " Now this here . . . some other man picked this . I heard talk of Chantrys and they were knowing folk . The man who built this house , he was a knowing man . He had a craft .

" We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dusted like a couple of women , but she was spit an ' span when we finished . The shed and the stable were solid-built , and there were good tools in the shed , leaning just like that dead man must have left them . Right close to the house was a spring , not more'n thirty feet away . Good cold water , too . Never tasted no better . There was a fieldstone wall around that spring , maybe eight , ten foot back from it , so a body could get water and go back to the cabin , leaving himself open to fire only in front . Even that was partly protected by a swell of the ground . Cabin had a good field all around , and a corral joined the house to the barn . The horses had been run off , and whatever other stock he might have had , but we pulled our wagon close and we unloaded . Not that I liked it much . Fact was , I did n't like it at all . Ever ' time we stepped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man had lain . I never liked that . Pa said , " Pay it no mind , son . That man would admire to see folks usin ' what he built . No man with a craft builds to throw away . He builds to use , and to last , and it would be a shameful thing to leave it die here , all alone . " " " Ai n't no neighbors , Pa . " " We do n't need neighbors right now . We need time an ' hard work . If this here land 's rich as I think , neighbors will come . Only when they do they 'll find a fair piece of it staked out an ' marked for we ' uns . " " Maybe those Indians will come back . " He just looked at me . " Boy , your pa ai n't as smart 4  | as some , but I 'm smart enough to know that Indians take the clothes off a dead man because they need , em . " His clothes was n't taken , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You bet . His clothes was n't taken , but somethin ' else was . You notice his pockets , boy ? " " They were inside out . " " They surely were . Now , boy , somebody wanted what was in that man 's pockets . Money and the like . Indians this part of the country do n't set much store by money . They want goods . They want things . Ai n't no money in them wigwams . " " " You mean , it was n't Indians ? " " Seen no moccasin tracks , boy . But I seen boot tracks a-plenty . Those who killed that man were n't Indians . They was white men . " We were eatin ' supper when Pa said that , and it give me a chill . If it was n't no Indian , then we were in trouble , ' cause a man can tell an Indian . He can spot him right off . But a bad white man ? How you goin ' to tell until he 's bad ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me and said , " Boy , you see strangers around , you come tell me , you hear ? But you see ' em first , an ' when you do you get clean out of sight . " Was n't much time for thinkin ' about things , because we worked . Seemed like Pa felt he owed something to the dead man , because he worked a sight harder than I ever seen him before . It was work from can see to cai n't see , for Pa an ' me . We measured out four sections of land . . . four square miles of it , field , forest , meadow , and stream . We had seed corn and some vegetable seeds . We planted forty acres to corn , and of an acre we made 5  | a vegetable garden . One reason we taken that corner because there was berries in it . But I never did forget that dead man . The stranger , when he came was alone . He was one man riding . He was a slim , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheekbones . He wore a black store-bought suit and a bandanna tied over his head like in the old pirate pictures . He had polished black boots , almighty dusty , and a fine black horse with a white and pink nose . He stopped afar off , and that was when I first seen him . He stood in his saddle and shaded his eyes at us , seeing me first and then Pa , who was working with a hoe in the cornfield . " Pa ? " I said , just loud enough . " All right , boy . I seen him . " Pa had his rifle in a scabbard set next to a bush close by . I seen him start to usin ' his hoe over thataway , but this man on the black horse came right along , an ' when I looked again I seen he was leading a spare . . . a packhorse . I guess it had been hidden behind him before , and I 'd missed seeing it . He come on toward the house settin ' easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rifle in a scabbard , too . Close to his hand . From under his coat I could see the tip end of a holster . Pa was n't far from the house but he moved over to stand where his rifle was , and he waited there . The man rode up , and called out , " Is it all right to get a drink ? We 've come far and we 're almighty thirsty . " Pa taken up his rifle and walked toward the house , leaving the hoe where the rifle had been . " He'p yourself , " Pa said . " It 's a dusty road you 've traveled. " 6  | The man 's features relaxed a little , almost like he was going to smile , only I thought he did n't smile very much , by the look of him . " Yes , it is . Most of my roads are dusty , it seems like . " He glanced around . " Is this the Chantry placer ' They call it that . " Are you a Chantry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the place deserted . Found a dead man on the doorstep . We buried the man , and we moved in . Seemed too fine a place to lay idle . " Pa paused a moment , and then he said , " Even if the land were n't so good , I 'd have hesitated to go on . That man Chantry , if he was the one built this place , had a feelin ' for good work . I just could n't bear to see it left run down . " The man looked at Pa a long minute . " I like that , " he said then , " I think Chantry would want you here . " He drank from our gourd dipper . The water was cold an ' sweet . We both knew how welcome that kind of water was to a long-ridin ' man . Pa taken to him . I seen that right off . There was somethin ' lonely and standoffish about that man , yet there was warmth in ' im , too . Like he had a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Might 's well stay the night , " Pa said . " It 's a fur piece to anywhere from here . Beyond , there 's the wild country . " " Well , " the man hesitated . " My horses could stand the rest . Thank you , and we will . " " You he'p him , boy , " Pa said . " I 'll start some bacon in the pan . " We went to the stable . I always liked that stable . In the hottest weather it was always shadowy and cool . The walls was thick , the roof was high , and 7  | there was a loft in one end for the hay we 'd mow come autumn time . I like the smell of fresh-mowed hay , of horses and harness , saddles and such . " You got some fine horses , mister , " I said . He nodded , putting a gentle hand on the black 's shoulder . " Yes , I have . You can always put your trust in a good horse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by you . " We took the rig from his riding horse and then from the buckskin packhorse . It was a heavy load ? lots of grub and a blanket roll . From the feel of the blanket roll I near ' bout decided he had another rifle or a shotgun hidden there . . . . One or t' other . Then he commenced to work on his horses . He taken out a currycomb and he done a good job , first one , then the other . " Been here long , son ? " " Got here early spring . We put in a crop soon as we cleaned up . " " Cleaned up ? Was the place a mess ? " " Nossir . It was in mighty good shape , ' cept dusty and all . Course , it was tore up a mite inside by them men searchin ' . " " Searching ? " " Them men that killed him . They tore things up like they was huntin ' for somethin ' . " I paused , not sure how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was Indians . " " No ? " " That dead man . . . his clothes was n't took , and his pockets was turned inside out . Pa says Indians would take his clothes . . . an ' maybe burned the place . " " Your pa is right " He paused , his hands resting on the horse 's back . " I like your pa , son . He seems 8  | like a right-thinking man . And I think he 's correct . Chantry would have wanted a man like him on the place . " Then he taken his saddlebags and rifle , an ' we walked to the house with the smell of wood smoke and bacon frying . He paused there on the stoop , and looked out an ' around . You could see a far piece from the door , ' cross meadows and past stands of timber . It was a pretty view , and the man just stood there , lookin ' at the rose color in the clouds where the sun was leaving a memory on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " this would be the place . This was what he would have wanted . " The floor inside was clean-swept and mopped . He glanced about , and I could see approval in his eyes . Pa saw it , too . " I never had much , " he said , " but I 've got sense enough to know that a place does n't stay nice without you keep it so . It takes a deal of work to build a place , and a deal of work to keep it up . " The food was good , and Pa always made a good cup of coffee . I knew that from what folks said , for Pa never let me have coffee ' cept a couple times on mighty cold mornin 's . " Too bad about that dead man , " the stranger suddenly said . " Anybody know who he was ? " " I ai n't been to town but once't and never talked to nobody ' bout it more'n to just report I 'd found a body and buried it . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . " There ai n't no sheriff . Just a marshal , and he pays no mind to nothin ' outside the town . I ' spect the dead man was the Chantry the place was named for , but I got no way of knowin ' . There was n't nothin ' in his pockets . " 9  | " Nothing inside the house either ? " Only books . A lot of them books , thirty or forty . Never look at ' em m'self . I do n't find much time for readin ' , nor the boy , either . Though he seems to have a leanin ' toward it . . . like his ma . She was a reader . " Pa hesitated , then said quietly , " My wife 's friends figured she married beneath her . That was one reason we come on west . Only she never made it . She died in Westport of the cholera . " " Was there anything else of his ? " " In that desk yonder . There 's papers and things . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . Dust over the papers . Some blood . " Pa paused . " Y'know , mister , I never said this even to my son , but I b'lieve there was somebody here with Chantry . Somebody who either went away with whoever come and killed him . Or who was taken away or maybe left before his killer come . " The stranger looked at Pa . " You are an observing man . Pa shrugged his thin shoulders and refilled the stranger 's cup . " See that alcove yonder ? With the bed in it ? Well , there was another bed in t' other room , and that alcove had a curtain before it . " The curtain was tore down when we come , but it ai n't likely there 'd be a curtain lest there was a woman in the house . I figger that woman either run away or was took away , and if she run away I figger she 'd come back to bury her man . " " So the mystery deepens , " the stranger smiled , showing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've done some thinking . " " I have . There 's a deal of time for it , with the work and all to keep a man 's hands busy . But not his mind . It 's by way of protection , too , for there 's two ways  | to think if they were white men . Either they come to rob him of what he had , and robbed him , or they come lookin ' . For something else . " Now if they came lookin ' for something else and did n't find it , they 'll be comin ' back . " Pa glanced at me . " I think the boy 's been thinkin ' of that , and it worries him . " " " It is a thing to consider , " the stranger said . " I think your son is wise . " It ai n't only them , " I burst out of a sudden . " It 's her ! " " Her ? " The stranger looked at me . " That girl . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this place is hers . All Pa 's work 'll be for nothin ' . " " If she returns , " the stranger replied , " I think she would be pleased that her friend had been buried and the place cared for . I should believe she would be very grateful , indeed . " I can not presume to speak for her , but do you stay on without fear and , if she returns , you will find you have lost nothing and perhaps gained much . " " They did n't get her , " I said then . " She got away . " Pa looked at me , surprised . The stranger stopped with his fork halfway to his mouth . Slowly , he lowered it . " How can you know that ? " " I seen tracks out back . They were old tracks , but a body could read ' em . Somebody came up , ridin ' easy . . . cantering . Of a sudden that horse was pulled up awful sharp , his hoofs dug in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own tracks and took off like lightnin for the hills . " " Did you see any other tracks ? " " Yessir . They taken out after her . There was two , three of ' em . . . maybe four . But she had a good horse an ' a good lead . " 11  | " They still might have caught her . " " They never done it . She got into them hills , and she knowed them hills like her own hands . She . . . " " How d' you know that ? " Pa said . " The way she taken to them hills , no stoppin ' , no hesitatin ' like . She rode right into them hills and she got to the little valley yonder an ' when she got there she drove a bunch of cattle ? " " What cattle ? " Pa said . " I ai n't seen no cattle ! " " There 's cattle , " I insisted . " She drove ' em up and then she started ' em back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then she went into soft sand where she would n't leave no tracks . " " Still , they might have found her . " " Nossir , they did n't . They followed her into them hills , but they lost her trail under the hoofs of them cattle , like she figured they would . They hunted a long time , then they come back . " " Are those tracks still there ? " " Nossir . There ai n't no tracks of any kind . On'y rains before that was soft and gentle , not enough to wipe out good tracks . " " Doby , " Pa never called me by name an awful lot , so he was almighty serious , " Doby , why did n't you ever tell me ? " I could feel my neck gettin ' red . " Pa , you was so set on this place . You takin ' to it like no other an ' all . An ' me , I liked it , too . I was afeared if you knowed you might pull out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' we 'd be ridin ' the wagon agin , goin ' nowhere much . I want to stay , Pa . I want to stay right here . I want to see our work come to somethin ' , an ' I want a place I know is home . " " Stay on , " the stranger said . " I think I can safely say it will be all right . "  | " But how ? " Pa asked . " How can anybody ? " " I can , " the stranger said , " I can say it . My name is Chantry . The dead man you buried was my brother . " Well , we just looked at him . Pa was surprised , and maybe I was , too a little . I 'd had a funny feelin ' all along , only mostly I was afraid he was one of them . " Even so , " Pa said , " What about his daughter ? An ' his wife or whoever she was ? Do n't she have first claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said quietly , " my brother was a widower , with neither wife nor child . He was a lot older than me . If there was a woman , then I have no idea who she was or what she was doing here . " " Pa cut himself a piece of work when he decided to farm that place , and it taken some doing for the two of us . And from time to time I headed for them hills , Pa liking fresh meat and there being no game close by ' cept an occasional deer in the meadow . Come daybreak , it bein ' Sunday , I taken Pa 's old rifle and saddled up the dapple . Saying nothing to Pa or Chantry , I just taken off . They were low , rolling hills that broke into sharp bluffs , kind of a bench , and then the high-up mountains lyin ' behind ' em . So far , I 'd never been so far as the mountains , but there they lay , a-waitin ' for me . They knew and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Right now I had me an idea , and huntin ' meat was second to that . Because that girl or woman , or 13  | whichever she was , headed right into them hills like she knew where she was going , and neither me nor them other folks found her . Least , I did n't believe they had . For certain , they never found her that first day . If she knew where she was goin ' , it stood to reason she 'd rode the hills before , many times maybe , and if there was any kind of a hideout , she 'd know where it was . It was n't worryin ' me much who she was . She 'd either been close by when the killin ' took place , or she knew somethin ' about it . She surely did n't waste any time askin ' questions when the shootin ' started . By now any sign she left would be washed away , ' less she was still back yonder and had cut fresh sign for somebody to follow . Any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for some place and I wanted to find out where . Whatever it was , or wherever she was , she figured she 'd be safe when she got there . Or that 's how it looked to me . It was cool an ' pleasant . My horse had a liking for far-flung trails as well as me , and he pointed for the hills like he already known where he was going . The grass was bound to be thick up yonder , and the water cold and fresh . I never had but just the rifle . I 'd always wanted me one of them pistols , but we never had the money for it . I had me a rifle and it was a good one too ? a Henry . I also carried me a bowie a man could shave with , it was that sharp . The dapple pointed us into a fold of the hills , climbed a little bit , and we topped out on a grass knoll with the wind stirring his mane and all the world spread out before and behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I  | was n't looking back . I was sixteen year old , and somewhere in the mountains there was a girl . Now in all my sixteen years I never stood up right close to not more than three or four girls of her age , and ever ' single time I was skeered . They just look like they knowed it all , and I did n't know nothin ' . That woman who rode off on that horse might be fourteen , forty , or ninety-three for all I knew , but in my mind 's eye she was young , gold-haired , and pretty . She was every princess I 'd ever heard stories about , and I was goin ' to meet her . For three , four years now I 'd been rescuing beautiful girls from Indians , bears , and buffaloes . In my dreams . But it never got down to where I had to talk to ' em . I kind of fought shy of that , even in my dreams , for I had no notion what you said to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of sized ' em up . Now mountains just ai n't all that easy to ride through or cross over . There has to be ways , and if you give study to a situation you can surely come up with one of the ways . Looked to me like I saw a faint trail goin ' up through the grass along the slope of a certain hill , so I taken a chance and moved out and that dapple taken that trail and held to it . I thought the trail seemed to peter out , but not for the dapple . He seen or smelled it , and just kept a-goin ' and we dipped down off that slope across a meadow so green it hurt your eyes , and then across a rough and randy little mountain stream that boiled along over the rocks like it was going somewhere a-purpose , and then into the trees . We skirted the aspens , and I seen an elk . It was a bull elk , maybe half-grown , and fat as a tick . That was meat for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and my rifle came halfway up before I stopped it . That shot would go echoing off up that canyon and warn anybody , friend or enemy , that I was on my way . Unhappy and feeling bad , I let that elk go . But it was too soon to shoot . I had a sight of country to see before I started telling ever'body I was there . At the edge of the aspen stand , I drew up the dapple and sat and listened . The elk kinda moved off , paying me no mind . I let him walk away , then looked up at the great swell of the mountain . It was rounded green , with a battalion of aspens marching down the slope in a solid rank til it came to a halt . Like a troupe of soldiers . From there on , it was only grass with a few dips and hollers here and there with tufts of brush showing . That trail I was following , or one kin to it , made just a little thread across that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trails , but you usually do n't see them from afar unless a body is above ' em . Trails can also be Indian trails , or they can be where some prospector has staked him a claim . . . or maybe even built him a cabin . Chantry had said his brother had no wife nor daughter . Who , then , could that mysterious girl or woman be ? She might be some woman Chantry taken up with . Or just somebody he 'd met or found who needed help . The dapple walked along easy-like . We dipped down into a draw , waded a branch , and had started up the opposite slope through the aspen when all of a sudden there were two men setting their horses right slam in front of me , barring the trail .  | One of them was a stocky , barrel-chested man with a broad , hard face and tiny eyes . The other man was much like him , only a mite bigger . " Where d' you think you 're going ? " the smaller one asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , kind of careless-like . " Figgered I might scare up a elk . " " This here trail 's closed , boy , " the other man said . " We got us a claim back yonder . We would n't want to get hit by no stray bullets . So you just hunt down below or off to the other direction . " A grin broke his hard face like somebody had cracked a rock . " Why , somebody was to shoot up here we might take it wrong . We might just figure he was a-shootin ' at us an ' shoot back . You would n't like that , now would you , boy ? " He was n't runnin ' no bluff on me . I did n't cotton to him , nohow , and did n't believe he had a claim back yonder . " Nossir , " I said , " I would n't like that . I would n't want nobody thinkin I actually shot at ' im an ' missed . Thing like that , " I said , " can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just looked at me . They 'd took me for some kid they could scare , not dry behind the ears , but I never was much of a one to scare . Back yonder to home I 'd heard a fussin ' in the pigpen one night when Pa was gone , and I 'd taken down his shotgun loaded with buckshot an ' gone with a lantern to see what for . Well , I opened the door of the pigshed an ' they was all backed into a corner with a full-growed cougar lookin " em straight in the eye . When that door opened he turned on me , ears back an ' tail a-lashin ' . Now nobody in his right mind corners a cougar , ' cause cornered they 'll fight . But I was n't of no mind to let that cougar make a 17  | bait of one of our pigs , so I ups with the shotgun and let him have a blast just as he leapt at me . That cougar knocked me a-rollin ' , tail over teakettle back out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rock and laid me out cold . But when Pa got home I had me a cougar skinned and the hide nailed up to dry out on the outside cabin wall . " Look , kid , " the bigger man said . " You 're a mite sassy for a boy your size . Somebody 'll take you off that horse an ' give you a whuppin ' , if you do n't watch out . " " Mebbe , " I said . " But he 'd be doin ' it with a chunk of lead in his belly . An ' if there was two of them , two chunks of lead . " This here 's a free country , wide open for all , and if you 're worried about gettin ' shot at , you just hightail it back to your claim , because I reckon I could see a claim and men workin ' and I 'd put no bullet near ' em . . .

Both men was pistol-armed and one of them had a rifle in his boot , but it was in the boot and them handguns was in their holsters . My Henry was lookin ' right at them . " You get your meat , " the stocky one said again . " But make sure you stay shy of this mountainside or you 'll get all the shootin ' you want and then some . " They turned their horses then and went back up the trail , and soon as they were out of sight , I reined my dapple over and whisked through the trees , myself . No tellin ' when they might try to circle around an ' take a shot at me . Followin ' that trail that day did n't look like good business , so I angled off through the trees , just  | getting myself out of harm 's way . I was n't no way eager for a shootin ' over anything like that , but I did n't figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way up a slope , turned north and then west with the lay of the land and the trees , and suddenly I come out atop a mesa , riding down amongst some all-fired big ponderosas , scattered spruce and aspen . Coming down through some big old trees I come upon a cabin . It set on a slab of solid rock with a big wide view of the whole country spread out in front . A body could see the Sleeping Ute , the great juttin ' prow of Mesa Verde , and way afar off , the Abajo and La Sal mountains of Utah . Some trees growin ' on the edge of the cliff kind of screened the cabin off , but a man with a good glass could of picked up ridin ' men some distance away . The builder had cut grooves in the solid rock and put in fitted squared-off timbers that were nigh twofoot through . They 'd been fitted like they 'd growed that way , and the roof was strongly built and solid . I knocked on the door , expectin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifted the latch and stepped in . I got a surprise . The place was empty . But the floor was swept clean , the hearth dusted , and everything spit an ' span . There was a faint smell in the room that was n't the smell of a closed-up place . It was a fresh , woodsy smell . And then I seen on a shelf behind me a pot with flowers in it and some sprigs of juniper . The flowers was n't two days old , and when I looked in the pot there was water for ' em . There was no bedding . There were no clothes hung on the pegs along the wall , and no dishes for cookin ' ' cept for a coffeepot. 19  | Outside , there was a bench by the door , and the grass below it looked like somebody had been settin ' there , time to time .

It was a girl or woman who come here , and she did n't come often , but when she did she set awhile . I found no tracks but hers . . . not even horse tracks . She must have come by horse . She 'd likely left it back in the brush somewheres . This was a deserted , lonely place , and it looked to me like the girl who come here liked to be alone .

The land sloped gently away in front of the cabin for a hundred yards , and where the grass ended against the trees there were some tall old pines that make it unlikely anybody could see the cabin from way down below , even with powerful glasses . There was water . And beyond the pines the mountain fell clean away down through timber where no  | horse could go , nor a man climb up without a good struggle . Behind , there was forest that swelled up into the mountain . A trail could lead off somewhere right or left of that swell . Suddenly I had me a idea . That woman had cleared up this place and left flowers . She liked the place and she liked it neat . I figgered to let her know somebody was about who liked what she had done . Who liked what she liked . Under one eave of the house I found a small Indian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and half-filled it with water . Then I went down the slope and picked some flowers and put them in the water . This I left on the table where she 'd be sure to see it . Then I scouted for a trail to go back down and found one . It was a faint trail , but it had seen some use , time to time . First off , I looked for sign . Whatever there was seemed to be maybe a week old . I followed along , studying tracks . It was a horse that weighed no more than eight hundred pound , but with a nice , even pace . And the woman who rode that horse was small , ' cause I saw the hoof tracks when the horse was unmounted and after , and her weight did n't make hardly a single bit of difference . Now I knew that trail led somewhere , and I had me a idea it led right to where those two men had come from , who braced me on the trail . So once I spotted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timber and hightailed it for the Chantry place . To home . Pa was out near the barn and he looked up when I come in . " First time you ever come home without meat , boy . What 's the matter ? Did n't you see nothin ' ? " " Never got a good shot , " I said . " Next time it 'll be different . " " We got to have meat , son . I 'll take a walk down 21  | the meadow , come sundown . Sometimes there 's a deer feedin ' down thataway . " Chantry come out on the steps . He threw me a quick , hard look . He 'd dusted off his black suit and polished his boots with a rag . He stood there on the steps , looking toward the mountains while I filled a bucket of water for the house . We all kept busy for a while , even Chantry , with his thoughts . It was coming up to sundown now , and when Pa took his rifle and started off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's a good man , your father is , " he said . " A real good man . " " Yessir . We 've had us some hard luck . " " This is rough country , " Chantry replied . " I like what he 's doing here . " " He just plain fell in love with the place . . . . All the work that somebody else had done . He could n't just go off an ' leave it be . " " I know . " Chantry looked at me again . " Now , boy , tell me what you saw today . " " What I saw ? I . . . " Well , I started to lie , but he was looking right straight into my eyes and smiling a little , and suddenly I did n't want to lie to him . So I told him the whole business from the start . Leaving out the flowers . " You think she and those men came from the same outfit ? " " There ai n't too many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the same outfit . She bein ' a woman . . . . Maybe she 's got different feelings . " " That might be the reason . And sometimes an honest person gets roped into a setup they do n't rightly know how to get clear of . What about that cabin ? Anything strike you odd about it ? " " Yessir . I believe it was built by the same man who  | built this . The same kind of work .... Only that place up there is older . I think maybe he lived up there first and kept lookin ' down on this flat country and decided to come down here and settle . " " Might be right . Or maybe he just wanted two homes . One up high , one down below . " He looked at me again . " What 's your name , boy ? " " Doban Kernohan . They call me Doby . " " Irish . . . . Well , we come of the same stock , Doby . I 'm Irish , too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old country a long time ago , and an ancestor of mine went to Newfoundland , then to the Gaspe Peninsula . From there to here , it 's a long story . " " You got a first name , mister ? " " Owen . A name that is sometimes Irish , and sometimes Welsh , they tell me . Well , there 's been a sight of changing of names , Doby , especially among the Irish . " There was a time long ago when Irishmen were ordered by law to take an English name , and around about fourteen sixty-five , a time later , all those in four counties were to take the name of a town , a color , or a skill . Such as Sutton , Chester , Cork , or Kinsale for the town . Or the colors  --  any one they 'd happen to choose . Or a trade , such as carpenter , smith , cook , or butler , to name just a few . " And some of the Irish changed their names because there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and when my great-grandfather escaped to England he was advised never ' to tell his true name , but to take another . . . or he 'd be hunted down . So he took the name Chantry , although how he came by it I do not know , unless he happened to see and like the name , invented it , or took it from some man he admired . In any event , the name has 23  | served us well , and we , I trust , have brought it no dishonor . " " I know little Irish history , " I said . " That 's likely , Doby , but the thing to remember is that this is your country now . It 's well to know about the land from which you came . There 's pride in a heritage , but it 's here you live . This is the land that gives you bread . " Yet it 's a good thing to know the ways of the old countries , too , and there 's no shame in remembering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be Irish . ... You 'll find places in eastern cities where they 'll hire no man with an Irish look or an Irish name . A good many of those who come here are poor when they land , and nobody knows what lays behind them . " Some are from families among the noblest on earth , and there 's many another who 's put a Mac ' or an 0 ' to his name to which he 's not entitled . But a man is what he makes himself , no matter what the blood or barony that lays behind him . " " What was your family name , Mr. Chantry , sir ? " " We 'll not be talking of that , Doby . Three hundred years gone by and every child of the family has known the name . But not one has spoken it aloud . And so we shall not . Chantry is the name we 've taken , and Chantry is the name we 'll keep . " " Did you come here to claim your brother 's ranch ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , lad , I came not for that . There was another thought in my mind , though t'was my brother I wished to see . The ranch will be your Pa 's and after him yours  --  but only to keep , and not to sell . I 'll make a deed that way . . . . But I 'll want living quarters here when I pass by , and I think I 'll claim the cabin up there the mountains are holding for me. "  | Something in my face drew his notice , for I was right worried , thinking of the girl . " What is it , boy ? What 's troubling you ? " he asked . " It 's just the girl . . . the woman , sir . I believe she likes the mountain place . I believe she goes there to be alone . She left some flowers there ... " I said . " If she loves the place she can come when she wills , but give it up , I 'll not . " Owen tapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to all the land you 've claimed and more . Even the slope of the mountain is mine , and a bit beyond it , here and there . " Four sections your father has claimed , and those four sections he can have . There 's thirty more I 'll keep for myself , for I 've a love for this western land , and here I may stop one day after I 've done some things that need doing . " It was the most I 'd heard him talk , and the most he did talk for many another day . At daybreak my eyes opened to hear the echo of a rifle , and I came bolt upright and scared . Pa was puttin ' on his pants and reaching for his gun . But we could n't see aught . Only that Chantry was gone and his horse was gone , too . But an hour later when he came in he had some nice cuts of venison wrapped in its own hide . " Here 's some meat , " he said . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did his share of the woodcuttin ' too , and he was a better than fair hand with an ax , cuttin ' clean and sure and wasting no effort . Yet he stayed close to the house , spending most of his time on the porch with his glass in his hand to study the rise of the mountains . 25  | Once I asked if I could look through it . " Yes , " he said , " but handle it gentle . There 's not its like in the world , I 'm thinking . It was made some time ago by a man in a country far from here . He was the greatest master of his craft , and the lenses of this scope he ground himself . " It was astonishing the way the mountains leaped up at you . Far away as we were , you could almost reach out and touch the trees . I could even make out the cabin behind its trees , the bench at the door . Was it that he was watching ? I felt a pang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? It was lonely country . When Chantry come along he brought some news . We 'd heard nothing of what went on . Here and there a prospector worked in the hills , but they were shy of Indians and so kept out of sight , just comin ' and goin ' on the run . South of us , in New Mexico , folks had told us there was n't no white men at all , that those who come before us had just gone on through or left their hair in some Indian 's wickiup . Some had come , all right , as we had , but they 'd not stayed and there was no record of their comings and goings . Pa found a rusted Patterson Colt once , down on a wash to the south of us . An ' a couple of bones an ' a few metal buttons , all that was left to show for somebody who tried to move into that country . But there was Indians a-plenty , though a body saw mighty few of ' em . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the west and south , and Apaches east . Some friendly , some almighty mean and evil . Some just plain standoffish , wantin ' to stay to themselves and not be bothered . Well , we did n't aim to bother them none . " I never give ' em much thought , " Pa said . " No more'n I would a white stranger . They 're folks . They got their ways , we got ours . If we cross , we 'll talk it over or fight , whichever way they want it to be . " Chantry agreed . " You ca n't talk about all Indians , the same way , boy . Any time a man comes along and says Indians ' or Mexicans ' or Englishmen ' he 's bound to be wrong . Each man is a person unto himself , and you 'll find good , bad , and indifferent wherever you go . " Did n't seem to me that Owen Chantry was taking any chances , though . When he put his pants on in the morning he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most men put their hat on first . He put on that gun belt ' fore he drew on his boots . " You figurin ' on trouble ? " I asked him once . He threw me a hard look . " Boy , " he said , " when a man comes at me shooting I figure he wants a fight . I surely would n't want him to go away disappointed . " I do n't want trouble or expect trouble , but I do n't want to be found dead because I was optimistic . I 'll wear the gun , use my own good judgment , be careful of what I say , and perhaps there wo n't be trouble . " He still did n't tell us why he 'd come to start with , and it was a question you did n't ask . He was more than welcome . In them days you could ride a hundred miles in any direction and not see a soul . Once Chantry got started he was a natural-born storyteller . Of a nighttime , when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadows made witches on the walls . He 'd been a sight of places and he 'd read the stories of ancient times , the old stories of Ireland , of the sea and some folks called the Trojans who lived somewheres beyond the mountains and did a lot of fighting with the Greeks over a woman . And stories of Richard the Lion-Hearted , who was a great fighter but a poor king . An ' stories of Jean Ango , whose ships had been to America before Columbus . And of Ben Jonson , a poet , who could lift a cask of canary wine over his head and drink from the bunghole . He told of Gessar Khan , stories that happened in the black tents of nomads in haunted deserts on the flanks of a land called Tibet . An so our world became a bigger place . He had him a way with words , did Owen Chantry , but he was a hard man , and dangerous . We found that out on the cold , still morning when the strangers come down the hills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the mangers for the stock , an ' I was in the loft with a hayfork when they come . Pa was in the yard , puttin ' a harness on the mules for the plowing . They come ridin ' up the trail , five rough men ridin ' in one tight bunch , astride better horses than we could afford , and carryin ' their guns . They drew up at the gate . And one of the men outs with his rope , tosses a noose over the gatepost , and starts to pull it down . " Hey ! " Pa yelled . " What d' you think you 're doin ' ? Leave that be ! " " We 're tearin ' it down so you 'll have less to leave behind . When you go . " The speaker was a big brawny man with a gray hat .  | " We 're not goin ' nowhere , " Pa said quietly . He dropped the harness where he stood and faced them . " We come to stay . " The two men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but my rifle was inside the house . Pa 's was too . We might just as well have had no weapons for the good they could do us now . " You 're goin ' , " the brawny man said . " You 're ridin ' out of here before sundown , and we 'll burn this here place so nobody else will come back . " " Burn it ? This fine house , built by a man with skill ? You 'd burn it ? " " We 'll burn any house and you in it if you do n't leave . We did n't invite you here . " " This here is open land , " Pa said . " I 'm only the first . There 'll be many more along this way ' for long . " " There 'll be nobody . Now I 'm through talkin ' . I want you out of here . " He looked around . " Where 's that loud-mouthed boy of yours ? One of my men wants to give him a whippin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just inside the barn . " I 'm here , and your man ai n't goin ' to give me any kind of a whippin ' . . . not if it 's a fair fight . " " It 'll be a fair fight . " The words come from the steps , and we all looked . Owen Chantry stood there in his black- pants , his polished boots , a white shirt , and a black string tie . " Who in hell are you ? " The brawny man was angry some , but not too worried . " The name is Owen Chantry , " he replied quietly . The stocky man I 'd met on the trail got down from his horse and come forward . He stood there , a-waiting the outcome . " Means nothing to me , " the brawny man said . 29  | " It will , " Chantry said . " Now take your rope off that post . " " Like hell I will ! " It was the man with the rope who shouted at him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unheard of thing out west of the Rockies . In Texas ( so Chantry told me later ) , Cullen Baker and Bill Longley had been usin ' it , but that was about the extent of it til that moment . Nobody saw him move , but we all heard the gun . And we seen that man with the rope drop it like something burned him , and something had . The rope lay on the ground and that man was shy two fingers . I do n't know whether Chantry aimed for two fingers , one finger , or his whole hand , but two fingers was what he got . Then Owen Chantry come one foot down the steps and then the other . He stood there , his polished boots a-shinin ' and that gun in his hand . First time I 'd ever seen that gun out'n the scabbard . " The name , " he said , " is Owen Chantry . My brother lived on this place . He was killed . These folks are living here now , and they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to stay , and if you have among you the men who killed my brother , your only chance to live is to hang them . You have two weeks in which to find and hang those men . . . . Two weeks . " " You 're slick with that gun , " the brawny man said , " but we 'll be back . " Owen Chantry come down another step , and then another . A stir of wind caught the hair on his brow and ruffled it a mite and flattened the fine material of his white shirt against the muscles of his arms and shoulders .  | " Why come back , Mr. Fenelon ? " Chantry said pleasantly . " You 're here now . " " You know my name ? " " Of course . And a good deal more about you , none of it good . You may have run away from your sins , Mr. Fenelon , but you ca n't escape the memory of them . . . . Others have the same memories . " Chantry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gun in his hand . " You 're here already , Mr. Fenelon . Would you like to choose your weapon ? " " I can wait , " Fenelon said . He was staring at Chantry , hard-eyed , but wary . He did n't like nothin ' he saw . " And you ? " Chantry looked at the stocky man who was settin ' to whip me . " Can you wait too ? " " No , by the Lord , I ca n't ! I come to slap some sense into that young'un , and I aim to do it ! " Chantry never moved his eyes from them . " Doby , do you want to take care of this chore right now , or would you rather wait ? " " I 'll take him right now , " I said , and I walked out there and he come for me , low an ' hard . My Pa come from the old country as a boy and settled in Boston , where there was a lot of Irish and some good fightin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , and when I was growing up he taught me a thing or two . Pa was no great fightin ' man , but he was a good teacher . He taught me something about fighting and something about Cornish-style wrestling . There were a lot of Cousin Jacks in the mines , then as ever , and Pa was quick to see and learn . But he was a teacher , not a fighter . Me , I started scrappin ' the minute they took off my diapers . Most of us did , them days . Here I was sixteen , with plenty of years already 31  | spent on an ax handle , a plow , and a pick and shovel . So when he come at me , low and hard like that , I just braced myself , dropped both hands to the back of his head , and shoved down hard with them . I was thoughtful to jerk my knee up hard at the same time . There 's something about them two motions together that 's right bad for the complexion and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost went down on his knees , and then come up . And when he did his nose was a bloody smear . He had grit , I 'll give him that . He come for me again and I fetched him a swing and my . fist clobbered him right on the smashed-up nose . He come in , flailing away at me with both fists , and he could hit almighty hard . He slammed me first with one fist and then with the other , but I stood in there and taken ' em and clobbered him again , this time in the belly . He stood flatfooted then , fightin ' for wind , so I just sort of set myself and swung a couple from the hip . One of them missed as he pulled back , but the other taken him on his ear and his hands come up so I belted him again in the belly . He taken a step back and my next swing turned him halfway round and he went down to his knees . " That 's enough , Doby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " So I stepped back , but watchin ' him . Fact is , I was scared . I might have got my ears pinned back , tacklin ' him thataway . . . . Only he made me mad , there by the road . " Now , gentlemen , " Chantry said , " I believe you understand the situation . We are not looking for trouble here . These good people only wish to live , to work the ranch , to live quietly .  | " As for myself , I 've told you what I expect . I know either you or someone you know killed my brother . I 'll leave it to you . Hang them , or I shall hang you . . . . One by one . " Now you may go . Quietly , if you please . " And they rode away , the stocky one lagging behind , dabbing at his nose and mouth with a sleeve . First one , then the other . Pa looked at me in astonishment . " Doby , I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back at him , kind of embarrassed . " I did n't either , Pa . He just gim me it to do . " Suppertime , watching the clouds hanging around the highup mountains , I thought of that girl and wondered what she was to them and would anything happen when they rode home . " You do n't really b'lieve they 'll hang their own men , do you ? " Pa asked . " Not right away , " Chantry said quietly . " Not right away . We looked at him , but if he knew it he gave no sign , and I wondered just how much he believed what he said . " You 'd really hang ' em ? " Pa asked him then . Owen Chantry did n't reply for a minute , and when he did he spoke low . " This is new country , and there are few white men here . If there is to be civilization , if people are to live and make their homes here , there must be law . " People often think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , unless it 's carried to extremes . Laws can give us freedom , because they offer security from the cruel , the brutal , and the thieves of property . " In every community  --  even in the wildest gangs and bands of outlaws  --  there is some kind of law , if 33  | only the fear of the leader . There has to be law , or there can be no growth , no security . " Here there is no established law yet . We have no marshal , no sheriff , no judge . And until such things exist , the evil must be restrained . A man has been murdered , you have been warned to leave . " This country needs men like you . You may not think of yourselves as such , but you are the forerunners of a civilization . Where you are , others will come . " And how about you , Mr. Chantry ? " I asked . He smiled , with genuine warmth . " Doby , you 've asked the key question . How about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gun . I 'll be needed until there are enough people , and when there are enough , I shall be outmoded . " I do not recall any other time in history when men like me existed . Usually it was a baron or a chief who brought peace to an area , but in this country it is often just a man with a gun . " " I do n't put no stock in guns , " Pa said suddenly . " I figger there should be a better way . " " So do I , " Chantry replied . " But had there been no gun today , your son would have been beaten by not just one man but several . Your fence pulled down , your house burned . " Civilization is a recent thing , sir . With many , it 's still no more than skin deep . If you live in a busy community , you must live with the knowledge that maybe two out of every ten people are only wearing the outer skin of civilization . And if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the restraint of public opinion , they would be utterly savage . . . . Even some people you might know well . " Many men and women now act with restraint be-  | cause they know it is the right thing to do . They know that if we are to live together we must respect the rights of those around us . Our friends in the mountains do not feel that way . They 've come to this remote place because they wish to be free of restraint , to be as cruel , as harsh , as brutal as they wish . " " You talk like a schoolteacher , Mr. Chantry , " I said . He glanced at me . " I wish I was a schoolteacher . It is the most honorable profession , done well . " He smiled at me . " Maybe , in a sense , that 's what I am . " " You say when there 're enough people you wo n't be needed anymore , " I said boldly . " How long 're you givin ' yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not more than thirty . Men become civilized by degrees . By adapting , compromising . " A man like you , with your education , I reckon you could do anything , " Pa said . Chantry 's smile was grim . " No , " he said . " I 've had a fine education , good opportunities , but I was trained for nothing . . . . To be a gentleman , to oversee land , to direct the work of others . To do all that one must have a business , or money to employ ... . I have nothing . " I have read . . . . and riding long distances alone has given me time to think . " " What about that woman up yonder ? " Pa asked . " She 's to be considered . Most definitely , she 's to be considered . " Somethin ' in the way he said it made me uneasy . I liked him . . . figured he was quite some man , but he worried me , and he knew it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He knew the kind of man he  | was . Whatever he done , one part of him stood off and watched . He walked outside to the steps and lit one of them slim cigars he smoked . He stood there , away from the light , and after helping Pa with the dishes , I followed him . " Have you seen her , Doby ? I mean that girl up there ? Have you seen her ? " " No . I ai n't . " He was silent awhile . His cigar glowed in the dark . At last he said , " I 'm going up there , Doby . Can you tell me how to get to that cabin ? " Then I was silent . There was a resentment in me . I had found that cabin my own self . What did he want to go there for ? What was the woman to him ? " Do n't know 's I could , " I said . " It ai n't easy . " " Is it that you can not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that there cabin is where she comes to be alone . She 's got a right . . . once in a while . I figure maybe she needs to have her a place , and I do n't want ? " " Doby , " he was patient . I could sense his patience . And his irritation , too . " That cabin is mine . I plan to live there , to return there from wherever I go . I , too , need a place to be alone . " I am not , " he paused just for a moment , " going to interfere with her solitude . There are other places in the forest and mountains where she can be . But I must go there . I have business there . . . . And perhaps I wish to see her . " " You 'll get her in trouble , Mr. Chantry . " " Doby , " his patience was wearing thin . " You do n't even know that girl . . . or woman . You do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making a thing out of this that it should not be . "  | " I just do n't like it , " I said stubbornly . " She even swept up . She dusted . She had everything to rights . She put out flowers . She loves the place like it is . " All that may be true , " Chantry said quietly . " But it 's my place , and I must go there . " A thought came to me at a sudden , a chance to get the better of him . " How about your brother ? Maybe he give her the right to go there . Maybe he even give the place to her . " It was a point , and he saw it . " Not that place , Doby , " he said then . " Some other place , maybe , but not that one . " " What 's so different about it ? " I demanded . " It 's a whole lot different " His voice was harsh . " Do n't mix into things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : that cabin is mine , and there 's a lot more to it than you know . " Well . . . maybe . All of a sudden , I did n't like him nearly so much . Yet , a man had to be fair . What he said was straight-enough talk . This here ranch was his , and he was lettin ' us have it . He could n't be more decent than that . When he could have told us to load up an ' git . He done no such thing . Plus he 'd stood by us in trouble . But still it rankled . Fair was fair . And it come to me that all I was sore over was because he was buttin ' into my dream . I 'd been dreamin ' of a girl up there at that cabin , a girl who was mine somehow . When I 'd never even seen her , did n't even know if she was a girl , an ' not some growed-up grandma of a woman . Maybe it was because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of girls to think on . A body needs somethin ' to build a dream with . Which was why , when I come to consider it , I 'd not been too anxious to meet up with that girl . . . . Because once I seen her , and her me , the dream might be gone forever . She might figger I was no account , or she might be nothing a man could be proud of herself . Just because a woman sweeps the floor and puts flowers in a pot do n't make her a princess . Nor even a girl to walk with ... . She might be old and fat . She might be a married lady with babies . She might be anything . The trouble was that all my thinkin ' would n't shake loose my dream , of her being young and gold and beautiful . She had to be . She just had to be . 4 Come daylight , Owen Chantry saddled up and rode away . I watched him take a trail that went to the hills , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Pa 's tone was n't gentle like usual . " Where d' you think you 're goin ' ? " " To the hills , " I said . " I want to see what he 's doin ' up there . What he 's goin ' to do . " " You stay right where you are . There 's work to do , boy , if we spec to make a crop and get wood laid by for winter . We ai n't got no time to go gallivantin ' over the mountains . " " Pa , I ? " " You leave him be . He 's lettin ' us have this outfit , ai n't he ? He stood by us , did n't he ? Whose business is it what he does ? "  | Well , there was that girl . Only Pa would n't understand about her . " Boy , do n't you get no notions now . That there 's a good man , but he 's a hard man , too . He 'll take no nonsense from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants , t is little enough . " Pa was right . Yet I did n't want him goin ' up there . He 'd change things . Maybe she would n't come there anymore . Then how would I ever find her ? But all the time I knew I was playin ' the fool . Knowin ' nothin ' about her , and her not knowin ' me . And who was I ? Just a green country boy who knowed nothin ' but horses and cattle . Scarce sixteen year old . How could any such girl be interested in me ? I thought no such thing , only I wanted to think it . And most of all I did n't want him to spoil it for me . So I went to work like Pa said and dug postholes and trimmed poles for the fence . But every now and then I 'd stop and look to the mountains and wish I was up there under them aspen , ridin ' the green trails like him . Owen Chantry rode his black horse into the canyon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half circle since leaving the ranch , scouting the country with care , and taking his time . It was all strange country , and the approach he was making gave him a better opportunity to locate the actual position of the cabin . Doby Kernohan had come upon it by accident and from another direction , and Doby 's grasp of its actual situation had been less than accurate . . . or perhaps Doby had n't wished to explain too well . Chantry frowned thoughtfully . What was it that bothered Doby ? Could it be the girl herself ? But  | Doby had n't even seen her , knew nothing about her .... His brother had built the cabin on the rampart . That he knew . Chantry 's left hand held the reins . His right was never far from his gun . Nothing in his years had left him trusting of men or human situations . He never lay down at night without a built-in readiness to rise suddenly to action . He never sat down to a meal with the certain feeling that he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing of the men who had tried to drive him out , nor of their connection with the girl . A lawless outfit , doubtless . On his right the towering mass of the rampart reared up , walls of rock almost sheer , but broken and rough enough so a skillful man might climb , if need be . It was crowned with a forest of trees ... . Pine or spruce , he could n't make them out at the distance . It lay like a big long loaf , thrust out from the mass of the mountains behind it . He studied the mountains before him . He must work a little more to the east , for the mesa seemed thus easy of access , and the faint trail he followed led that way . A deer walked into the trail before him , unawares . It stepped slowly along , then suddenly caught a glimpse of him , ducked into the trees , and was gone . Overhead the sky was impossibly blue , with puffballs of white cloud . Toward afternoon they would bunch together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon the rains came , never lasting for long . Sometimes the showers were intermittent . There were no tracks in the trail he followed except the tracks of deer . This trail was possibly un-  | known . Yet Chantry was cautious . It never paid to underrate an enemy , to assume they knew less than they did . Were they southern renegades , come west after the war ? Some of the old Quantrill or Bloody Bill Andersen crowd ? He drew up in the dappled shadow of a clump of aspens and studied the trail ahead of him , watching the trees , the ground , the birds . . . listening . Did they know of the cabin on the rampart ? Possibly only the girl did , if she came there to be alone , as Doby believed . Doby had seen no other tracks , no other signs . He slid his Henry from its scabbard and rode forward along the trail . It was very still . He turned off the trail and went into the trees . When he had gone a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the trees he could see all the land to the west , a magnificent sweep of country with the vast bulk of the Sleeping Ute topping the horizon . He was high up , with a sheer drop of two hundred feet or so a few rods away , with trees all the way to the edge . This was the vast rampart visible from the ranch . He must be close to the cabin . He stepped down from the black and stood listening . Far off he saw several elks come from the brush to feed . There was much ponderosa here . He walked slowly forward , crossing a wide area of bare rock swept by runoff water . He saw several old stumps from trees cut down long ago , no doubt to build the cabin he was looking for . Suddenly he saw it , partially screened by ponderosa and spruce . He knew it had been built by his brother , who understood the use of broadax and adz , 41  | of squared logs . He liked its solid look , yet he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a still older structure . But like the cabin , it was set deep into the native stone . Owen Chantry , in a lifetime of drifting , had looked upon many constructions with a critical eye , and this one presented some interesting aspects . At first glance it was but another log house , yet it gave evidence of care in its framing and fitting , and the choice of its site . Concealed , it nonetheless offered a magnificent view to the west , with almost equally fine views to the south and north . To the east the view was cut off by trees and beyond them the vast bulk of the La Platas , with their bare peaks , slide-rock slopes and forested flanks . Chantry could detect no movement near the cabin . Tying his mount under the trees and out of sight , he took his rifle and crossed the sparse grass to the doorway . The latch-string was out . Lifting it , he opened the door . Inside all was empty and still , yet freshly swept and dusted . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the ashes long dead . He walked back to the open door and looked westward through the trees . Screened from view , the cabin was nevertheless a perfect observation point for all that moved in the valley below  --  and the vast spread of land that reached out in all directions . The air was cool with the scent of spruce . A pleasant place , certainly , and a place in which to be alone . Owen Chantry leaned against the doorpost . The mountains showed blue with distance . Farther to the north , somewhat fainter , lay the La Sals ... . Wild country , almost unknown country from here to there . And farther on lay a maze of canyons . Father Escalante had come through , and Rivera had ex-  | plored some of it a hundred years ago . Seeking a route only , they probably had seen little of the country . He looked around him again . For the first time in thirty years , he felt at home . The winters would be cold , for the altitude was high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food to last out such a winter , and he must have reserves within himself on which to draw . He went inside the cabin . It was as trim indoors as out . Thoughtfully , he examined the walls , the logs solid and fitted one to the other without crack or crevice . No chinking here , for the logs had been faced with an adz until each lay cheek to cheek against the other . . . . A wall two feet think or more , and a handsome stone-flagged floor . There was a ceiling and hence at the back , at least , a small loft . The hewn planks of the ceiling lay from beam to beam , fitted tightly . There seemed to be no He distinctly heard the sound . . . . A horse walking , a horse that came slowly forward , then paused .. . just outside . Owen Chantry turned swiftly , rifle in hand . 5 The horse stopped , blew slightly , and a saddle creaked . Owen Chantry stepped into the doorway . The girl was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at each other . " You 're more beautiful than I expected , " he said . 43  | " Who are you ? " " You can not guess ? You knew my brother , I think , and he was not unlike me . " " You are Owen Chantry , then ? Yes , I see his face in yours . I knew Clive . He was a good man . A silent , mysterious man , but good . Too good a man for what happened to him . " " That needs to be talked about , " Chantry said quietly . " I noticed a coffeepot inside , but no coffee . Did you bring some ? I notice you have a lunch . " Her eyes searched his face . He was tall , leaner than she had seen at first , but wide-shouldered . There was a deceptive stillness in his face , deceptive because she already knew much of this man . A strange , morose man , Clive had said . Too good with a gun at too early an age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at first been a wild and reckless leader in the cavalry , a man whom the war had changed . The war , and other things . She took the pack from the horse and walked past him into the cabin . She turned . " Will you build a fire ? I think there 's is enough here for two , if we eat lightly . " " Eating lightly has become a way of life for me , " he said wryly . " Yet there have been good times . " He went out to the edge of the woods and broke the small dry twigs off the lower trunks of several trees , the little branches that start to grow , then die . From a fallen tree he peeled bark , and then he walked back into the house . There he knelt , crushing the dry bark in his hand , placing it on the old ashes , and then the twigs . When he had the fire going , he added the larger branches . There was a good stock of dry wood in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old now , and rotting .  | " You know they intend to kill you ? " she asked . " I have that impression , " he said . " I met some of them but they did n't seem disposed to attempt a killing then . " " Strawn was n't with them . . . nor Freka . " He looked around at her . " Tom Freka ? And Jake Strawn ? " " Yes . " " Well , well . That , of course , changes the situation somewhat . " " You know them then ? " " We 've never met , if that 's what you mean . But I know them by reputation . Yes , I know them . I 'd say the company you choose is not always the best . " " No ? Perhaps I did n't choose them . Perhaps I was put into a situation I never wanted . " Chantry chuckled softly . " That happens to many of us . I guess the true worth of a man or woman is just how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he added , the smile disappearing . " And I have n't risen far . " She turned and stared at him . " Do you know the whole story ? " He shrugged . " Who does ? I think I know most of it . I never believed it all . " He smiled wryly . " One hears so many stories . . . . Lost mines , treasures buried by outlaws . . . . The country is full of such stories , most of them pure nonsense . Most people who have gold do not bury it . Clive had no interest in gold , I think . But he had a scholar 's ways , which took him to Mexico to start with . Were you close to him ? " " No , not close . He did n't confide in me . " The smell of coffee reached them . Chantry leaned back and looked out through the open door at the way the sunlight fell through the 45  | aspen leaves . " Nor me either , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silent man . " She turned around to him . " Yes , he was , " she said . " And also a gentle man . " " Mac Mowatt has surmised . . . as others must have . . . that a treasure of gold was buried here , or somewhere about it . . . . But that is purely their speculation . Nothing of the kind is certain . " He smiled again , and the girl was amazed at the way his face became warm and bright . He was a man , she knew suddenly , who rarely smiled . " Value is a matter of personal attitude , " he said . " What is very valuable to one man may be utterly useless to another . Your outfit thinks it must be gems or gold . " " You do n't ? " " Look , " he said quietly , " none of us can know for sure . My brother was a man of letters , an explorer , a scholar , a man of inquisitive mind . To him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ancient manuscript , a clue to some historical revelation . " " A book ! Just think of that ! " She was amazed . She stared at him . " Why , those men out there would go mad with disgust ! They 'd never believe it . They 'd never accept it . All this effort for something not made of gold ? " " They have a faith , " he said . " They 're believers , the men of your family . They live with that one idea in mind  --  to find a treasure that probably does n't exist . But you could never convince them of its nonexistence . " " You truly do n't believe there 's gold ? " " No . " " We 'll have to drink from the same cup , " she said . " Charming ! " he smiled again . " It will be a privilege . "  | She indicated the flowers in one of the pots . " Did you leave those ? " " No . I thought you put them there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'll bet it was Doby . " " He must be the young man living with his father in Clive 's house below . I 've seen them from here . " " That 's right . He 's Kernohan 's son . . . . They 've moved in on Clive 's place . Doby 's the one who whipped one of your boys . " She made a face . " That was Wiley . I never liked him . Nor 011ie Fenelon , either . " " Are they kin of yours ? " " Wiley is n't . " " I think Doby 's dreaming about you , " Chantry said . " He found this place , and he was n't at all happy I was coming up here . He wants you left alone . " " I believe I like Doby . " " He 's sixteen , and lonesome . I know how he 's feeling because I 've felt it myself . I used to dream about a golden-haired princess I could rescue from all kinds of danger . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looking across the room into her eyes . " A man never stops dreaming . I like Doby . He 's a good lad . He 's got a father who works hard even when the odds are against him . " She refilled the cup and handed it to him . " They 'll kill you , you know , all those men . There are too many of them . " " " We all must die . Sooner or later . But I do n't think I 'll make it easy for them . How many are there ? " " Fifteen to twenty . Some of them come and go . " " Where do you fit in ? " " Mac Mowatt is my stepfather . My mother is 47  | dead . I am Marny Fox . . . I am told our name was Shannach until the English made us change it . " " They 're a bad lot out there , you know . " " Some of them are bad , " she spoke with heat , " and some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mac Mowatt . Oh , there 's bad ones among them , but Frank is fine . He 's Mac 's oldest son . If it had n't been for Frank . . . " She hestitated . " Frank is different . He 'd prefer to be ranching somewhere . He 's a good man , a solid man , but he 's loyal to his father . .. . And he 's been like a father to me . " They sat silently then , listening to the soft rustle of the aspen leaves . Chantry emptied the cup and handed it back and Marny refilled it from the coffeepot on the hearth . He knelt beside the fire and added a few sticks to the coals . The day was waning and she must leave soon . . . . There was always danger ? the danger of discovery  --  if she stayed long . " It 's damned foolishness , " he said irritably . " Nobody even knows what 's actually here . " Two men rode north out of Mexico . One Chantry . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valuable . The two men wintered here , and then Mowatt . . . or so one story goes .. . died here . Some say he was killed . " And some say that started the bad feeling . Some say it began when Mowatt was accused of deserting Clive . It 's all long ago . Over the years the story has grown to include a vast treasure . And men have died for believing it . " " But you do n't believe it ? " He shook his head . " Marny , I just simply do n't know . But Clive was akin to us all in his interests , which were intellectual , historical . . . what you will . " Some of us have done well with money  --  damned well in some cases  --  but more by accident than in-  | tention . So I simply believe that Clive found something of historical interest . . . something immensely valuable to him . " " Would n't Mowatt have known it ? " " Possibly . . . but possibly not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many who ca n't . Clive was a linguist . " " So ? " " He might have been bringing back proof of some fancy of his . From Mexico . And how much could two men carry ? They were riding Apache country . How vast ' could the treasure have been ? " Chantry stood up . " You 'd best be getting back , and so had I. " She gathered up a few things and went to her horse . " You 're going to move in here ? " " Soon . " " They 'll find it , Mr. Chantry . And they 'll also find you . ? " Call me Owen . " He smiled easily . " You wo n't tell them , then ? " " No . . . I owe them nothing . Perhaps I owe Mac Mowatt a little . And Frank . Frank 's looked after me since I was a little girl . " " Your mother married Mac Mowatt ? " " Yes . He was much older than she , though she already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mac had known him . Mac met my mother when he came by the house to see my father , not knowing he was dead . " She swung into the saddle . " Be careful , Owen . There 's no nonsense about them , and some are a bad , bad lot . In their minds there is a treasure , and in their minds they 've already split it among them . They 'll kill you as quickly as they killed Clive . " He watched her ride away and then walked back 49  | to his own horse . He brought the black in close to the house and then he went inside . It was dark there now , shadowed and still . He took a stick and spread the coals a bit , pouring the last of the coffee on them . Then he stood up and looked slowly around . Something was hidden here , something he must find . He believed in no treasure . But find it he must or he would never be free and it was freedom  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live here , sit outside on that bench with a few books , watch the sun set over Utah and .. . he would ask for no more . Well , he might not have to be alone . For the first time , he even considered that . 6 All the day long I waited for Chantry to get back . Pa seen I was restless , and a couple of times he stopped to say something but he did n't . It was away after dark before we heard his horse come clipclopping into the yard . He hallooed the house , then he rode on to the barn to put up his black . Pa had left some bacon an ' side meat on the table , but he only ate a mite . " I had a little something in the hills , " he said . Now I knew he taken nothin ' with him , so 's he must have been fed . Was it her he got his food from ? " Did you find the place ? " Pa asked . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chantry quietly . " And I can see why Doby was impressed . My brother had a love for this country . "  | " Wonder how come he got clear up there ? " Pa said . " It ai n't a likely place . " " Prob'ly hunting meat , " I said . " Or searching . . . . " Chantry said . Well , then I looked at him , and so did pa . " You mean he might have knowed somethin ' was up there ? " I asked him . " My brother was a man who knew much about a lot of things . He had a gift for languages . Let him hear one . . . or so I was told . . . and inside a few days he 'd be speaking it . I think when he came north he rode to a place he 'd been told to find . I do n't think it was accidental . " " But why ? " I insisted . He shrugged . " Sometimes a man just wants to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You know , Doby , this is Ute country , with Navajos west and south of here . But even they never saw this country until about the year one thousand , when they came down from the north . " They were migrants then , as we are now . They came , they conquered whoever was here , and they settled down . Just a few miles east of here the Utes will tell you there are ghost houses along the sides of the mesas . ' No white man has seen them , but I believe the Indians . " Who built those houses ? Where did they come from ? How long have they been there ? Who was here first ? Did the builders invent the structures they built ? Or were they drawing on memories of other houses somewhere else ? " " You got a awful lot of questions , " I grumbled , but no answers . He smiled . " That 's the charm of such questions , 51  | Doby . Sometimes it 's a joy just to try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not . " Pa taken the coffee to the table and I set there just itching to ask Chantry if he seen her , for he surely was n't going to tell ' less I did ask . Made me mad , the way he set there eatin ' and talking about nothin ' that mattered . Finally , I could n't wait no longer . " Did you see her ? That girl ? " " I did . I did even more . " " You mean you talked to her ? " " For an hour or so . Had a bite of lunch with her . Like a picnic . " Chantry looked up at me , his eyes calm . Maybe there was just a mite of laughter in ' em , too . Her name is Marny . " Is she kin to them ? " " No blood-kin . She 's old Mac Mowatt 's stepdaughter . " Well , you should have seen Pa 's head come up then . He turned straight round on Chantry . " You mean . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They were . " Pa looked like a ghost stepped on his grave . " Mac Mowatt . . . . That 's a bloody outfit , Chantry . I 'd no notion they were even in the country . " " Do you know them ? " " I know ' em . I knowed ' em years back , ' fore the war . They were a tough bunch then , but ever since the war they been a mean , man-killing crew . Ever since Strawn and Freka tied up with ' em . " " The big man was 011ie Fenelon . The fellow you whipped , Doby , is named Wiley . " " What 's she like ? " I asked him of a sudden . I was n't payin ' no mind to what he said about Mowatt  | and them . Or what Pa said . I was thinkin ' of that girl . " She is n't blonde . . . no golden hair and blue eyes , Doby . I 'm afraid that part did n't pan out . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , desperately . No . She 's very beautiful . . . . Very . She 's about five-foot four , with auburn hair and greenish eyes . Good complexion . Her name is Marny Fox , and she 's Irish . " " How . . . how old is she ? " " She 's an old woman , Doby . Why , she must be every bit of twenty ! " Twenty ... four years older ' n me . Four years ! That was a lot , a whole lot . But I had to protest . " That ai n't no old woman ! " I said . There was more talk . And finally I went to my room and turned in , but I lay there quite awhile . The outlines of my dream have already grown kind of mistylike . Twenty years old . . . . Lots of married women were n't that old . Still , she was pretty . Maybe even beautiful . Right then I made up my mind . I was going to see for myself . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Looked like I 'd have to be mighty careful . From the way Pa acted , Mac Mowatt must be something fierce . And I 'd heard talk of Strawn , myself . An ' he was a killer sure enough . When he was in Kansas there was talk of him . He 'd killed a man around Abilene , and another on a cattle drive . You heard a lotta stories of such men in them days . Talk went up and down the trails . There was n't no newspapers , but where a man stopped there was always somebody with a story to tell . There was talk of trails , gunfighters , Indians and the like , along with talk of wild horses like the famous 53  | white pacing stallion . That was a story ever'body heard , in sev'ral different accounts . And stories of mean steers , even the length of their horns , and of horseback rides men had taken . Them western horses , mustang stock , were tough and wild . When they run the rough country on their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the holes they knew best , and range back to ' em ever ' now and then for a drink . Herds them days was big . . . hundreds of horses runnin ' together , maybe sometimes thousands , and some fine stock among ' em . That surely could n't Fast . Horse-hunters was always weedin ' out the best breedin ' stock for themselves . Next day , I give some serious study to Owen Chantry . He was a hard man who 'd rode some rough trails , and he shaped up like trouble . Still , the day he nailed that gent 's hand he could have killed him ... an ' some would say he should . I said it . He looked at me sharply . " I should have , Doby . I 'm just a damn fool sometimes . I should have killed him . Because somebody will sure enough have it to do . " Then when we were alone outside , he said , " That was a nice thing you did , Doby . Leaving the flowers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowing anying about it . " I found the pot , an ' . . . well . I figured she was a lonely woman .... " " It was a nice thing to do . " He paused a moment , looking westward across the wild , broken land . " When you ride , Doby , - make sure you carry a gun and keep your eyes open . That 's a bad outfit up there . " " Maybe , " I said . He shot me a glance . " You think otherwise ? "  | " Maybe they 'll get friendly , like . . . . They 're her folks . " " " They 're not blood-kin . " " Ai n't no matter . I ai n't anxious to shoot nobody . " He just looked at me again and walked away to the end of the porch . All I could think of was riding to the mountains again . I was wishful of meeting up with that woman . . . that girl . I wanted to see for myself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Chantry talked with Pa about bringin ' some good cattle into the country . On the dry side of the mountains like we were , there was n't much water , but still , there was enough so cattle could drink , and the forage was pretty good stock feed . Same time I was thinkin ' of that girl I was also thinkin ' of that golden treasure Chantry had told us Mowatt believed was there . Owen Chantry took it light , but maybe he was just tryin ' to talk us out of lookin ' . Somebody 'd gone to a whole lot of trouble if it was just a little thing . Did n't make sense to me that a growed-up man would set that much store by anything but gold or jewels , like . Seemed to me a mighty silly thing that a man would risk his life to save a little old book , maybe nobody but a schoolmarm would put a value on . There just had to be gold up yonder . A thought came to me , but I put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was replacing the golden-haired girl with a golden treasure of coins and such . But I paid no mind to the thought . I 'd not even seen that girl yet , and I 'd not believe Chantry ' til I did . Right that minute I did n't care much for him . He was a sharp , hard man , I figgered , with reasons of  | his own for what he done . And seen close up that black suit of his was worn on the cuffs , and the boots he polished nigh ever ' night , they were far from new . Not that Pa and me had better . But he set himself up so high . " What was her name ? " I asked him again . I recalled her name . It was a dream name that was downright pretty . " Marny Fox . She 's Irish , Doby , " he said , " or part Irish . They do n't much like the Irish back east . Too many of us were poor when we came . But this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for ourselves . " " I heard Pa speak of how hard it was . Why do folks have to be like that , Mr. Chantry ? " " It 's the way of the world . Across the sea , every man has a place he fills , and it 's a hard and long thing to break free from it . " We have to earn our place , Doby , just like all the others . There 's no special sun that shines on any man , regardless of religion , philosophy , or the color of his skin . There 's no reason why any man should expect a special dispensation from pope or president . In this country , more than any other , you have to make your mark . You 're not going to be treated like something special until you are . " Some men become outlaws . They ca n't make a living honestly , so they try to do it by force and strength . But everything is against them , and they can not win . " " A man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It helps . Every book is a school in itself . Each one can teach you something . But you can learn a lot by observation . The most skillful trader I ever knew , a man who started as a pack-peddler  --  he was Irish , too  --  became a mighty big man in business , and  | he could n't write his own name until he was over forty . " By the time he was fifty he could speak four languages and write as good a letter as any man ... . He was a wealthy man before he was able to write . " " If you know so much , why ai n't you done better ? " I demanded , rudely . " I do n't see you sportin ' no pocketful of gold , an ' you 're out here at the bobtail end of creation with nothin ' but a horse . " He looked at me and his eyes were almighty cold . " I have n't done well , Doby , because I 've been following a will-o-the-wisp . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He paused a moment . " Your comment is just . I know what can be done , but I have n't done it . Perhaps there were too many rivers I wanted to cross , too many canyons I had n't followed , too many towns with dusty streets down which I had n't ridden . " The trouble is with wandering that after a bit a man looks around and the horizons are still there . There are nameless canyons and rivers still unknown to man . But a mortal man is suddenly old . The dream is there still , but rheumatism and weakening strength rob him of the chance to go further . " See me five years from now , Doby . . . or ten . " Well , I just looked at him . He was n't payin ' me no mind , just lookin ' off across the country , thinkin ' his own thoughts . Me , I had thoughts of my own . Then Chantry walked out to his horse . Whenever he had thinkin ' to do , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that black was a baby . Yet he cared for the packhorse just about as well . I went inside . Pa was settin ' by the fire . " Pa , you think he 's speakin ' the truth ? " " Who ? " Pa was startled . " You mean Chantry ? Course he is ! " 57  | " But maybe they had reason to kill his brother , if they done it . " " We done found the body , son . And I know ' bout Mowatt and his outfit . I heard . " " You heard . Ai n't you always told me not to b'lieve all I heard ? " " You had trouble with ' em first , Doby . " Well , that kind of backed me up in a corner . It was true . They 'd been mighty rough with me . So I just said , " That do n't prove nothin ' . " It was a feeble answer and I knowed it . We needed poles for fencing if we were growin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lump and taken off for the hills to cut aspens . Aspens grow tall and slim . Just right for making a fence quick , usin ' them as rails . I taken an ax and when I fetched up to the nearest grove I go down and set to . Sixteen ai n't many years , but I was strong and I 'd used an ax good , and I made the blade bite deep an ' fast . By noon I 'd cut enough poles for the best part of a day . I looped a half hitch and a timber hitch to ' em , took a turn around the saddle horn , and dragged the poles out to where I could get at ' em when I come with the team . I dragged the first bunch , then the second . That done , I taken my horse to the creek , and when he 'd had himself a drink I picketed him on the good feed there was where I 'd been cuttin ' aspens , and then I set down by the stream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , the bread all squeezed up and out of shape , but it tasted almighty good . When I finished eatin ' , I hunted ' round for wild raspberries but they was skimpy and small . In a good 58  | year they 'd be plenty of ' em around , if a body got to them before the bears and birds . But I found a few dozen and started to turn back my horse when I seen something move out of the tail of my eye . My rifle was on my saddle so I just squatted down at the edge of the trees , hopin ' I had n't been seen . By that time it 'd been the best part of an hour since I 'd been choppin ' trees . So there 'd been no sound from me that a body could hear more'n a few feet off . Lookin ' up to where I 'd seen that movement , I set still an ' waited . The mountain sloped up under that cloak of aspens to the very foot of that great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The cabin itself was across the canyon and more than a mile . . . maybe two mile off . Lookin ' over a canyon that way , distance can fool a man . Mountain air , specially over here on the dry side , is almighty clear and I could see somethin ' movin ' at the base of the red wall . He might be atop a rock slide . That was a place I 'd never had cause to go , and I did n't know for sure . . . but he was alongside the rampart . Now my eyesight is good , and blinkin ' my eyes a couple times , I set to lookin ' off to one side a little and , sure enough , I saw that movement again . Something was movin ' along the base of that cliff , for sure . And while I set and watched , that somebody or something  --  moved along the base of the wall and finally disappeared . I set there a-awaitin ' , but whatever it was was gone . Now I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a animal , but it looked otherwise to me . I believed it was a man , or a man on a horse , and who-59  | ever it was might have been lookin ' for a way to the top . If a body could find a way up that cliff , he could save himself several miles of ridin ' to and from .. . an hour or more each way . And it struck me then that whoever I 'd seen was him . . . Owen Chantry . He was huntin ' a quick , easy way to the top . Well , why not ? I could just as well do that my own self . Settin ' back where I was . . . . Well , I pulled back fifty yards from where I 'd been an ' set down on a stump . Then I gave study to that red wall . Most places it was so sheer a man would have to be a sure-enough mountain climber to scale it . But there were a couple notches on the south side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd been workin ' north along the west face when I seen him , and when he disappeared . I looked at the sun . Too late . I 'd have to hightail it for home to get there ' fore sundown , ' cause I had to go down to the river canyon and up the other side , and I was n't wishful of tryin ' it after dark . It was a right spooky ride down and up in the daylight . Even ridin ' a good mountain horse like I had . Tomorrow . . . tomorrow I 'd have to hitch up the team and come after them poles . Once up here I 'd picket the team and head for the red wall . Right then I had a worried time . What right did I have to go traipsin ' off ? Pa was doin ' his share , and it was up to me to do mine . He needed them poles . He needed the team , and he needed me and my time . We had our work cut out for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An hour , maybe two . I picked up my ax and stuff and headed for the canyon . What if I picketed the team an ' a mountain lion 6o  | come down on ' em ? Or a bear ? Course , most times bears wo n't kill livestock , not unless they done it before or need to eat . We could n't afford to lose that team , not even one of ' em . The bottom of the canyon was dark when I got there , but the top was still gold with sunshine . That trail was a hair-raiser . But it would 've been more scary if it had n't been for part of the slopes bein ' timbered . I fetched to the bottom . It was dark down there , only water shinin ' like silver . We splashed through and started up to the crest . A third of the way up I stopped to let my horse catch wind , and I turned in the saddle and looked back . I seen nothin ' , but I heard splashin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Me , I touched a heel to my horse an ' we started on . I did n't know what was back there , and I wanted to make no effort to find out . This was a plumb spooky place , and even if it was just one man , I wanted no gunfight on that hairline trail . When I topped . out on the crest , I put a spur to that gelding an ' lit out for home . It was n't far , but I let my horse go . Coin ' home , that was the fastest horse . I never seen a horse had more love for home and the stable than that one . He lit out for home like he had fire under his tail . The house light sure looked good ! I rode into the yard , slid off that horse , and led him into the stable . Pa come to the door . " Dry that horse off , boy , an ' git in here . Supper 's on the table . " When I taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the partition and there was Owen Chantry 's 6i.  | black . I hung up my saddle and spoke soft to the black , and put a hand on it . Wiped off , yes . Curried a mite , yes . . . . But the skin was damp . I was sure the skin was damp . When I come through the door , Chantry was settin ' at the table with Pa . He looked up and smiled , and that made me sore . Who did he think he was ? And how did he beat me gettin ' home ? Maybe it was n't him . Then I was wondering . Who was it out there ? Who followed me up that canyon trail ? 7 Owen Chantry was restless , irritable . What he wanted was something to read , but the Kernohans were not readers . There was only a copy of the Iliad , which had belonged to his brother . Which was odd , for Clive had always been a reader . " Kernohan , " Owen said suddenly , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clive was a man who liked reading . I would have expected him to have some books . " " Books ? Oh , sure ! There 's a-plenty . We boxed ' em up an ' stored ' em in the loft . They was takin ' up space and collectin ' dust , so we just put ' em up there . " Me , I never did learn to read much , an ' Doby here , he 's mostly innerested in horses an ' guns . " " If you do n't mind , " Chantry said , " I 'll look those books over . Might be something to read . " " He'p yourself . I looked through a few of ' em but there ai n't much there that makes much sense to me . Books by them Greeks , histories an ' such . Nothin ' that would he'p a man work land . " 6z  | Dawn came with a cool wind off the mountains , a smell of pine and the chill of rocky peaks where some of last year 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snow . Owen went to the woodpile and took up the ax . For a half hour he worked , cutting wood for the cooking fires . From time to time he paused , leaning on the ax and taking time to study the country . His eyes searched out every canyon , every draw , placing them exactly in his mind . Lost Canyon lay just north , a great , timbered gash coming down from the northeast . Only barely visible from where he stood , he had ridden to it on his first scouting of the country . A creek ran along the bottom . ... One day he would go down there . It was one of the last areas in the States to be settled . Rivera had reached it in 1765 , and Escalante had passed through in 1776 . Otherwise the vast land had remained unrecorded by any white man , yet men must have ridden through , hunted and prospected here . There was always one curious rider who went a little further , or passed through going from here to there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd seen and done . When Owen left the woodpile he climbed to the loft and rummaged through the books . The Odes of Horace in the original Latin did him no good at all . Clive had been the Latin scholar of the family . There was a two-volume edition of the poems of Alfred Tennyson ? a contemporary  --  published in 1842 . Chantry had read some of Tennyson , and enjoyed him . The rest could wait . He took up the two Tennyson books and climbed down . He opened a book when he reached the last step and looked through it , riffling the pages and glancing 63  | at a poem here and there . One page was marked by a torn piece of newspaper . It was " Ulysses . " He closed the book and put it down for later reading . When he walked outside again , both Kernohan and Doby had gone . The team was gone , as was Doby 's gelding . Owen had started back toward the house when he glimpsed three riders coming down the draw toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed it beside the door . Suddenly , he saw movement near a bush by the stable . His hand was poised for a draw when a voice called out , " Do n't shoot , Owen ! " It was Kernohan , hoe in hand , unarmed . " Stay right where you are or get into the barn , " Chantry advised . He was watching the riders . He knew that bay . It was a big horse , weighing twelve hundred or more and standing over sixteen hands . It was notoriously fast and had won many races around the country . It was Strawn 's horse , and nobody ever rode that horse but Strawn . Freka would be with him . Freka was part Finlander , a troublemaker who had lived in a colony of Scandinavians in Utah until they drove him out . He was known to be a good man with a gun and had figured in several pointless killings in the past few years . They turned into the yard and drew up when they saw Chantry standing in the door , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Strawn said casually . " It 's been awhile . " " Fort Worth , was n't it ? " Chantry asked . Freka was the thin , blond man in the checkered shirt . The third man was heavier , a barrel-chested  | fellow with a bull neck and a shaved head to whom Chantry could n't yet put a name . " You boys traveling ? " Chantry asked them . " Sort of prospectin ' around . You ever been to the La Platas ? " " Time or two . " " Rough country , but mighty purty . How 's for a drink ? " " Water or coffee ? We have n't any whisky . " " Coffee sounds good . " Strawn swung down from his bay , and the others followed . Slowly , they walked toward the house . Halfway there , Freka suddenly turned and looked toward the barn , pausing , then saying something in a low voice to the barrel-chested man , who was nearest him . Owen Chantry got down four cups from the shelf and then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled their cups . " No sugar out here , " Chantry commented . " Honey all right ? " " I favor it , " Strawn said . He was a good-looking man , his face somewhat long under a high forehead , with carefully parted and combed hair . He was a man of nearly thirty but he looked younger . He was good with a gun . He had been in a couple of cattle wars and several shootouts . Jake . . . that was the third man 's name . He 'd used other handles from time to time , but that was his real name . " This here 's a long way from somewhere for you , Chantry , " Strawn said . " I figured you for a town man . " " I like wild country . The wilder the better . " " Well , you got it , " Strawn said . " There just ai n't  | hardly nobody around here . You could ride a hundred miles in any direction and find nobody .... Nobody . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked up , grinning . " You seen them ? " " They stopped by to visit . Did n't stay long . " Strawn stared at him , then smiled . " Well , well . You mean you backed him off ? You backed off Mac Mowatt ? " Chantry refilled their cups . " You know how it is , Strawn . Mac did n't figure the odds were right . Maybe he wanted company to be present . He might have been waiting for somebody . " Strawn chuckled . " You know , I like you , Chantry . I really do . Hope I never have to kill you . " " Be a shame , would n't it , Strawn ? Somebody sending you out on a job like that ? And you so young , too . " Strawn 's eyes glinted , but he chuckled again . " Good coffee , Owen . I 'm glad we stopped by . " " You know , Jake , I was hoping to have this talk with you . You know me better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew me to lie . " " You ? " Strawn stared . " I 'd shoot the man who even suggested it . " " Mowatt is after something , Jake . He 's after something that is n't even there , that never was there . I do n't know all the facts , but I do know there 's no treasure . There 's nothing here that would be valuable to anybody but a scholar . " " What 's that mean ? " Freka was suddenly alert . " It means that when my brother rode up out of Mexico he brought something he valued greatly . . . and the treasure story got started . " " So ? " " What he brought . . . and I 'll admit I 've never  | seen it . . . was information . A book , a manuscript , some notes . . . perhaps a plaque of some kind . To someone trying to reconstruct history it would be valuable . But to the average person , worthless . " Freka smiled with exasperation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a story like that . Why would a growed-up man risk his life for something like that ? " Jake Strawn looked thoughtful . " And if there 's nothing there , we wind up empty ? " Chantry shrugged . " Did you ever hear of Mowatt giving away anything of his own ? Look , Jake , you 've ridden for some tough outfits , and so have I , and you know that nobody but some crazy kid , some wild youngster fights for anything but gain .... Not in our world . So if there 's no gain in treasure , where 's the payoff ? You know I 'm good with a gun . I know you are . I know damn well I do n't want to come up against you for fun , and I do n't think you want to lock horns with me for no payoff . " " And you say there 's no gold ? " " I do . What I suggest is this , Jake . I suggest you and Freka talk to Mowatt . Make him lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing is following a dream . Somebcdy told a story once , and then it was told again and again and each time it got bigger . A Chantry riding out of the desert with treasure in gold on him . With a a Mowatt . How did they carry all that vast treasure ? " Strawn , Chantry could see , was half convinced . But Freka was n't even listening . In fact , he was making a great show of ignoring the talk . " Hot air , " Freka said . " Mowatt 's no fool . He knows what he 's about . " " Like a hundred other foolish prospectors roaming these mountains to the east of us , hunting for gold 67  | they 'll never see . " Chantry emptied his cup . " Just thought I 'd lay it on the line , Jake . You know me , and I know you . " " So why 're you here ? " Freka demanded . " A good question , Freka . I 've had a brother killed , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something you 'd not likely grasp . " I 've been up and down and across this country . I 've gambled and fought , and I 've killed men for reasons that might seem slight . I 've fought in cattle wars , and town-site battles , for railroad rights of way and just about everything else . I 've never had much and never expect to have , but I 'd give ten years of my life to add just one little bit to the knowledge of the world . " We Chantry 's have a failing , Freka . We like to finish what we start . I know the history of my family for two hundred years the way you know the trail to Santa Fe . And we 've always finished what we started , or died in the trying . It 's a kind of stubbornness . . . damned foolishness , maybe . " Look , Strawn , a million years or more ago men began to accumulate learning . Over the years more bits and pieces of knowledge have been added and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I think what Clive Chantry brought back from Mexico was a piece of the pattern , his brick for the wall . Maybe it was a clue to a lost civilization , maybe a treatment for some killing disease , maybe a better way to grow a crop . Maybe it 's one of the books of the Mayas that did n't burn . The one thing I know is that it was n't gold . " Freka yawned . " Jake , let 's ride . This talk is puttin ' me to sleep . " He got up . " You talk mighty well , Chantry , but I do n't buy it , not even a piece of it . " 68  | Strawn got up . " You suggestin ' I lay off , Chantry ? " " No . We 're mercenaries , you and me . We 're paid warriors . All I 'm asking is that you make sure the payoff is there . If I got up against a man of your caliber , I want to be sure I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I 'll be paid , that I know . But what will you get out of it ? " If we lock horns , Jake , one of us is going to die . There 's a better than even chance that both of us will . I 've seen you in action , and you 're good . Damned good . I believe you 've seen me in action , too . " " I have . " " Well , make Mowatt come up with something more than hot air . " " Mowatt knows something . He does n't go off halfcocked . " " No ? How many times has he told of a Wells-Fargo treasure chest that was supposed to be loaded with gold . . . and then it turned up empty ? " " Maybe you 're right , Chantry . But Freka wo n't buy it . He wants to kill . And he 's good , Chantry , damn good . " " I hope when I find out how good he is you do n't have me in a cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own battles . You and him . . . I 'd kind of like to see that . " Strawn picked up his hat and followed Jake and Freka , who had gone outside . " See you , Owen . " He paused . " I 'll talk to the old man . " Owen Chantry stood in the door and watched them ride away . Kernohan slowly approached the house . " What was all that about ? " " Strawn and Freka , killers working for Mac Mowatt , and dangerous men . " 69  | " Taken you long enough . I figured you was old friends . " " No . . . Jake Strawn and I know each other by sight and reputation . We 've even eaten in the same bunkhouse , and he rode shotgun on a stage I drove a few times . I 've never seen Freka before . . . but he 's mean as a rattler , and just as deadly . " " Strawn ai n't ? " " Strawn 's one of the best men with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of lead before he dies . He 's got six bullet wounds I know of , and he 's still breathing good . The men who shot at him are dead . I was just trying to convince him there was no gold , so there could n't be a payoff . He almost bought it , but Freka did n't . Freka does n't care . " Kernohan was silent a minute . Then he said , " Chantry , I 'm goin ' to pull out . Me and the boy ai n't geared for such as this , and I do n't aim to get him hurt . " Chantry shrugged . " Your decision , Kernohan , but you 've got a nice place here . You can run cattle and do well . You 've a meadow or two where you can cut hay , and there 's water . You 'll have to hunt awhile to find its equal . " " Mebbe . But I do n't aim to get my boy shot up for nothin ' . I do n't take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endin ' up like Strawn or them others . " " Like me ? " Chantry suggested . " Or you . I do n't know much about you , Chantry , but if your stories are true you 've been mixed up in a lot of shootin ' . " " Yes , I have . And you 're right , Kernohan . But stay . . . I 'll keep them off your back . But talk Doby out of going into the hills . He 's got a kind of case on that girl . "  | " He 's never even seen her ! " " He 's a boy alone , Kernohan . Do n't you recall how it was ? At sixteen there 's always a girl you dream about . Well , she 's the only one around . " " Let ' im dream . Wo n't do no harm . " " Not unless he ties in with that Mowatt outfit just to be close to her . " Kernohan swore . " I wondered why he taken his ridin ' horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , worried . " He 'll come back . I know he will . " Chantry had a sudden thought . " Kernohan , when you first got here were those books boxed up ? " " No , they was on that shelf . " " He pointed . " Was there anything else ? " " No , not 's I recall . " Kernohan sat down at the table . " That poor man lived a bit after he was left for dead . You could see that . " " How do you mean ? He 'd been dead a good while , you said . " " He had . But there was writin ' on the step . That 's why I figured there might be treasure . He tried to write some numbers . " Show me ? " " Sure . It 's faded now . He had a stub of pencil . " They walked outside . On the riser between the first and second step was written , in a barely legible scrawl , one word : Ten " He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coyotes or wolves might have twisted his body round some , but I figgered he started to writin ' some figgers and died ' fore he got any more wrote down . " Owen Chantry straightened up , disappointed . He had hoped for a clue . . . Clive had been a careful man . He would have 71  | known that if Owen was alive he would come . And , being Clive , he would have tried to leave some message , some clue . But there was nothing ... simply nothing at all . When I got back to where I 'd cut the poles I picketed the team and taken my saddle horse . Right then I. had my doubts . I had a sinkin ' feeling in my belly , like . Pa would never 've left a team like that , to be gone nobody knew how long . There were varmints in the mountains , and a heavy team , picketed like that , would n't even have a fightin ' chance against ' em . These were big horses , and most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they had to fight . But all I could think of was that girl . Owen Chantry might have been tellin ' the truth , but I just had to see . I still did n't like him much , he was too durned sure of himself . I could n't see where he was so high an ' mighty . So with one long look around , I taken off a horseback . Pa was back at the ranch , and so was Chantry . I had it all to myself . I 'd scout around , then come back , hitch up , an ' try to make it back with the poles before it come nighttime . Sure ' nough , back in a notch of that rampart I found me a way up . It was a scramble , that was , but I had me a good mountain horse and we made it to the top of the mesa . A moment there , we stood to take a look . Then I turned that horse of mine and started across  | the top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When I come into the open , I could look off across the country . There was a box canyon in front of me , just off a little ways , and beyond it a fine roll of country , timbered heavy . Some place off thataway was prob'ly where Mowatt was holed up . I had me a notion to ride over there , explaining that we were neighbors an ' all , so why not be friendly ? But I had another notion that warned me that for all my words to Chantry , I was n't that sure . So I turned my horse toward the cabin . Out of the corner of my eye , I thought I seen something move in the trees , so I turned quick in the saddle and looked back . Nothing . Maybe I was a half , or three quarters of a mile from the cabin . I walked the horse along . Here and there I could see bare spots on the trunks and limbs , high up off the ground where porcupines had eaten the bark . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good tree . The cabin stood silent . I saw no horse , and it was a disappointin ' thing . I pulled in . I walked to the door and lifted the latch . Inside it was cool , dim , and still . There were fresh flowers in the pot I 'd put on the table . I looked around some more , then turned and went outside . An ' there sat three men on horses , an ' one of ' em was that man Wiley . They just set a lookin ' at me an ' grinnin . My rifle was on my horse and my horse was away t' other side of them riders . " Well , well ! " Wiley was grinning . " This is the one I was tellin ' you all about . " A redheaded man I had n't seen before had him a 73  | rifle across his saddle . " You want I should shoot him a little ? " he asked Wiley , grinning . " Maybe cut his ears back ? " " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " No . I reckon not . I promised myself I 'd pin his ears back my own self and if you shoot ' em off , how can I ? " " Look here , boys , " I said . " No use for us to have trouble , us bein ' neighbors an ' all . Why do n't we just set down an ' get acquainted ? Pa an ' me we 're no kin to Owen Chantry . We never seen the man ' til he showed up down there . " " What 's the matter , kid ? You scared ? Why you so friendly of a sudden ? " Wiley had got down from his saddle , taking his time . I started to move toward my horse , and the redhead aimed his rifle . " You stand quiet , kid , unless you want your guts all over the grass . " The other one , the one who 'd been on the trail that first day with Wiley , he was takin ' his rope off the saddle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , all alone , and them three men was beginnin ' to shape up trouble . I wished I had me a handgun , and for a minute there I wondered if I could jump back into the cabin and slam the door . There was n't no way I could make it to the woods without bein ' run down or shot . That redhead just kept a-grinnin ' at me . Then Wiley started for me , an ' I started to jump for the door . But the redhead snapped a loop over my head ' fore I 'd took a step , and his horse taken off at a jump , throwin ' me to the ground . I 'd heard about men being dragged to death , so I grabbed for the rope . But he just jerked me again , and the rope tightened . Then Wiley walked over to me , and he had him a club about four feet long .  | After startin ' to get up , I had my feet jerked out from under me again . And Wiley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' and tried to twist away . Maybe I done so a little , but he fetched me right over the shoulder with that club . An ' then he started at me again . I tried to get up but that rope jerked me down , and then all I could remember was a terrible pain from them blows . Wiley swung that club . He hit me over the head , over the shoulders , and across the back . I come to , raised myself an ' run at him , butted him with my head . knockin ' him sprawlin ' on the grass . Then I jumped on him with both feet . They jerked me with the rope and I fell again , but when Wiley reared up over me I doubled back my knees and kicked him on the knee with both my heels . And down he went again , roaring with pain and anger , and I rolled around and lunged at him . I think the redhead was n't tryin ' too hard , and that he did n't truly mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that other feller , they sat up there laughin ' . Wiley give me another bat over the head and I went down to my knees . I could feel the blood comin ' down in my eyes , and I dove at him again . He got away from me and knocked me sprawlin ' . Then he came in swingin ' at me , but I fetched him a kick again , and he fell . Dazed like I was , and hurt , I could only just try to keep goin ' at him . But when he got up again he just had at me . How many times he hit me , I could n't later recall , only he beat me somethin ' fierce . When I finally tried to get up , he hit me a fearful swing and I felt a terrible pain in my side an ' I just fell over and laid there . All I could feel was pain , and I bit at the grass so 's they would n't hear me groan . Wiley walked up on me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Aw , leave him be , Wiley ! You got your evens ! " " I 'm gon na kill him , " I heard Wiley say . " Forget it , " somebody said . " Hell , he 's hurt bad . The way it is , he 'll never get home . I think you busted some ribs that last time . Leave him be . " Nowhere then did I lose my thoughts . I could hear them talkin ' and I did n't much care if they killed me , I hurt so bad . Finally I heard them just a-ridin ' off , an ' I lay there , thinkin ' of night comin ' on an ' Pa 's team with the varmints around . Somewheres along there I kinda passed out , an ' when my eyes opened again it was plumb dark , an ' must 've been dark for some time , because I was all over wet from dew . And cold , so cold I could n't hardly breathe . Diggin ' my fingers into the grass , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movin ' toward me and it was my horse . I spoke to him , " Brownie , " I said . " Brownie ... " He come to me , snortin ' a little because I smelled of blood . But he stood by me and I managed to rear up enough to catch hold of a stirrup . I drawed myself up , and a pain went through my side like a knife stuck in me , so I leaned against the horse , and whispered to him . My head throbbed an ' I was sore . I was n't goin ' to get into that saddle . There was n't no way could I make it . Best thing to do was get inside that house and get a fire a-goin ' . Somehow I got the reins up and looped them over the pommel . Then I got my rifle from the scabbard and I taken my saddlebags with my lump in ' em . Then I kinda leaned on the rifle and slapped the gelding on the hip and said , " Go home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways and stopped . That horse  | did n't want to leave . Then I must 've passed out again , ' cause I was cold and shivering when next I opened my eyes . Somehow I crawled inside . Dragged my rifle with me , and got the door shut . There was fuel there , and a fire fresh-laid . I managed to get it alight , fed it some sticks , and passed out again . During the night I half woke up , sick and moaning with pain . The fire was down . I got more sticks on it and saw the coffeepot . There was a mite of coffee left but not near as much as I wanted . I nudged it into the coals . Then I set , shiverin ' , feelin ' that terrible throbbing in my skull and the pain in my side and a rawness and soreness all over . At no time was I more'n half conscious , but when I come to again  --  woke up by a pain , I guess  --  there was a smell of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cup in my saddlebags with my lump , and I got it out and spilled coffee into the cup . I got myself a swaller or two and spilled some over my lips . They were all swole up , but the coffee tasted good . I passed out again , all torn up with pain and sick and wishin ' I 'd listened to Chantry and never come up here at all , nor trusted them people . She found me . That girl . I was almighty sick and she come across the mesa to the cabin and found me there . It was full daylight and I was conscious but I could n't move anyway . I was just layin ' there , all sick and sore and knowin ' I was goin ' to die . Laying there half-dead I 'd heard a horse a-comin ' . At first I figured it might be Brownie , or them men comin ' back , but it was n't no wanderin ' horse . That horse come right up to the cabin and I heard a saddle creak . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 77  | seen blood on the stoop . And then the door opened and I heard a gasp . It was like in a dream , or when you 're only half-awake or somethin ' . I felt a hand touch my shoulder and turn me on my back , and it hurt somethin ' awful and I cried out . Next thing I knowed I heard breakin ' wood and smelled the smoke and heard a fire going . I could hear the pine wood crackle and smell it , too . I knowed I was in bad shape , but there was just nothin ' I could say or do . She taken some cloth and wiped off my face , cleanin ' up the cuts and dabbin ' here and there at me . Then she began to work over me with her fingers , testin ' for sore spots an ' breaks . When she touched my ribs I gasped right out . She went out for water and brought in some more wood . And once when my eyes were open I glimpsed her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had no golden curls , but her hair was kinda dark red , like , with a little bit of gold in it , and prettier'n any gold-haired girl I ever seen . " Pa , " I whispered . " I lef ' Pa 's horses . . . . I was cuttin ' poles . I lef ' ' em . " " Do n't worry ' bout it , " she told me . " They 'll be all right . " " Pa sets some store by that team . I got to ? " " You just lay still . We 'll get word to your pa . I 'll go get the team later . " She made up soup and got some of it in me and I felt her fussin ' with a finger that was hurtin ' . Somewhere along there I faded out again , and when next I knowed anything I heard him talkin ' . Chantry . " His horse came home , " Chantry was saying , " and I made sure his father stayed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it down if they get a chance . "  | " Did you come straight here ? " " Backtracked Doby to the team . They 're all right . I watered them and changed the picket pins and then headed up here . He 'd found a way up the face through a notch , so I followed him . I knew he 'd come here . " " Chantry come nearer and stood over me . I felt like I was a hundred miles off , driftin' ' in some dream world . The voices came through , but faintly . " He 's taken quite . a beating , " I heard him say . " I think some ribs are broken , and he has a broken finger . " Chantry touched my hand " See ? A rope burn . They roped him and he tried to grip the rope . That means there were at least two of them , probably more . This boy 's a fighter . " He was checkin ' my body . I felt his fingers at my ribs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him say , " We 'll splint that finger . And we 'll tear up his pants and bind them tight around him to hold those ribs in place . I 've known ribs to knit with no trouble . " The rest is mostly cuts and bruises . Whether he 's hurt worse , only time will tell . He took some nasty raps on the skull . " " How can we move him ? " " A travois . The same way the Plains Indians carried their goods and their wounded . I 'll cut a couple of poles and we 'll rig up a travois . " They talked some more , and then he was gone . When I next figured out where I was , we was alone in the cabin , me and her . I opened my eyes . Every part of me was sore , and my head throbbed somethin ' awful . When she seen I was awake she come over and 79  | spooned more soup into me . It tasted good . " Thanks , " I mumbled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Three . One of them put a rope on me , but I put Wiley down . I put him down two , three times . We fought all over the place . That redhead ? " " Thrasher Baynes . " " He left me just loose enough to fight . I figgered maybe he did n't mind all that much if Wiley got hurt . " " He would n't . Thrasher does n't care much about anybody . But he appreciates nerve . If you showed grit , he 'd like it . " " I marked him . I marked Wiley . " " Good for you . Now rest . " It was a mighty long trip down that mountain . The team followed behind , draggin ' the poles I cut . There was times when I knew what was happenin ' and times when I just passed out . And times when the joltin ' down the trail hurt something fierce . But they taken me home , Chantry an ' her . Pa was there with his gun . He was standin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was nigh to tears when he seen me . Pa 's not a cryin ' man . " He looks worse than he is , " Chantry told Pa . " That 's a tough son you got there , Kernohan . " " He 's a good boy , " Pa said . " He 's always been a good boy , an a he'p to me . I figgered to take up land so 's he could make a better start than me . But I do n't know . All this , I might just ? " " Do n't . You stay on . This is a good place . " Chantry suddenly changed his tone . " This is land bought legally from the Indians . When the time is right , I 'll transfer title to it . "  | Long after they had me inside and in bed , I heard the murmur of her voice out there with them . She was n't blonde with golden curls and all , but she was pretty , she was almighty beautiful . And twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be seventeen , and I was a man growed . . . . And she even said I had nerve . Later , some time later , I heard Pa say , " If there 's nothin ' there , an ' you know it , why do n't you just tell ' em ? " " I tried to . They believe too hard , Kernohan . Men will give up anything rather than what they want to believe . And hate you for telling them there 's nothing to believe . And even if you prove it to them , they 'll continue to believe , and hate you for proving them foolish . Sometimes they give up , but they 'll like you no more . " I 've seen men come to a ground where treasure was said to be buried , and with holes all over the hills , they 'll dig another one , and then another . " One thing I know , my brother was here for some time . If there was anything of value here , he would have found it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would leave some clue . " Chantry paused . " Moreover , knowing him , he would probably leave such a clue as only I would be apt to discover . " " What kinda clue could that be ? " Chantry shrugged . " I will have to remember what passed between us , and which of my tastes he knew best . Clive was a fine man , a much better man than I in every moral way . But he had a complicated mind , and so have I , and any clue he left would be useful to no one else . " " Well , " said Pa , " for the life of me I ca n't figger out what kinda clue , or how you 'd ever guess it . " 8i  | I 've got to go back , " Marny said . Chantry turned toward her . " Do n't . Stay here . " " No , I 've got to go back . At least one more time . I have things there . . . . Well , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Will they know you 've been to the cabin ? " " No . I do n't think so . But they 'll go there now . Mac Mowatt will be certain he can find what there is . They 'll tear the place apart . " " Maybe not , " Owen Chantry said . " Maybe I 'll be there . " " " Alone ? Against them all ? " " I wo n't be inside . I 'll keep some freedom of action . " I heard Chantry walk across the room . " Yes , I think I must do that . I must be there when they come . I want to keep that cabin . " " It 's lonely , " Pa said . " It 's a mighty lonely place . Of a wintertime a man could be snowed in . That house must be nine thousand feet up . " " I 've been up high before . " I never seen her go . She just taken off and was gone when I waked up , with only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I was scared for her . . . scared . I had a bad feeling about her going back . I tried to sit up and got such a stab of pain in my side that I laid down quick , gasping for breath . She was gone . There was nothin ' I could do . If I just had my old rifle and was up in them rocks . . . well , maybe I could n't do nothin ' , but could surely try . Suddenly Chantry stood over me . " You all right , Doby ? I heard you cry out . " " Did n't mean to . Yeah , I 'm all right . But I wish you 'd bring her back . That 's a bad outfit . I wish you 'd fetch her , Owen Chantry . "  | " I 'll be at the cabin . She knows that . " " If she ever gets there . Mr. Chantry , I 'm scared . I 'm plumb scared for her . She do n't think they knew she knowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . " " Chantry looked grim , and he had a face for it . He was a right handsome man , but there was a coldness in him sometimes that would frighten a man . " I 'll just go see , Doby . I 'll ride up there . Right now . . . today . " He wasted no time . He got on the big black and taken his packhorse and headed for the hills . And seein ' him ride out , I wondered what would happen when him and the Mowatts come together . Maybe he was only one man and they was many , but she sure would n't be no one-sided fight . Not with him being the other side , no matter how many they had . There was soinethin ' about that man that made you believe . Even me , who up til then had n't wanted to believe much of anything ' bout Owen Chantry . Somehow , busted ribs and all , I had to be there . I had to be up on that mountain when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man without illusions . Nothing in his experience had given him the idea that he was protected by any special dispensation from Providence . He had seen good men die when the evil lived on , and he was aware that he was as vulnerable as any other man . Yet a man does n't command a cavalry outfit , scout 83  | for the army against the Indians , drive a stage and ride shotgun without acquiring a feeling for the possibilities . Chantry 's life was due to his own skill and to a certain amount of sheer coincidence . For if he was a foot past the spot where bullets struck , it was only circumstance and the fact that he was moving faster or slower than the men the bullets found . Owen Chantry had asked no favors of destiny . He put himself in the hands of his own skills , a good horse , and a good gun . Crossing the canyon at a place where another canyon joined it from the east , he climbed a rough but not too difficult trail . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspens , which were favored by beavers and elks . He took his time . At this altitude a man did not hurry , not even with a mountain-bred horse . Mac Mowatt was a tough old renegade who knew every trick in the books and could invent more on the spur of the moment . Nor were his followers to be taken lightly , for they were all bred on the frontier . To a man . Chantry paused near a beaver pond , letting the horses drink a little while he studied the mountainside . Always he was careful to stop against a background where his body merged easily into the colors . From a few yards away , he was almost invisible to the casual eye . He studied the mountainside with no sweeping glances , but with a yard by yard survey , leaving no tree , no rock , and no shadow unobserved . Occasionally , he took a quick glance back over what he had just examined .  | A squirrel leaped to a branch nearby and eyed him curiously . A few yards off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look around . Owen Chantry spoke to his horse and turned into the aspen , weaving through the slim and graceful white trunks , around deadfalls and occasional boulders , fallen from the mountain . The hogback , a ten-thousand-foot ridge  --  timbered on top , the sides rugged and almost sheer  --  thrust out from the mountain just below a peak called the Helmet . Before him were the towering cliffs of the Rampart Hills . He avoided the route that he had first taken around to the back of the hills , but turned toward the trail Doby Kernohan had discovered . His problem was simple enough . He was to get Marny Fox out of there and , if there was time , to get whatever it was they were all looking for . Not for a minute did he believe it was gold . Tracks of deer and elk were everywhere , and twice he saw the tracks of a grizzly , distinguished from other bears by the long claws on the forepaws . He noticed a log the bear had ripped open to get at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch a dipper bob up and down on a rock . He saw a school of trout lurking in a shady place where a branch hung low on the water . No amount of seeing ever made nature old to him , and he was conscious of every movement and every sound . It was very still . Sitting his horse among the trees Chantry could look up above the towering red cliffs at the clear blue sky , tumbled with banks of fleecy white clouds . Somewhere he was conscious of movement . It was no sound he heard , but simply some feeling , some 85  | sense that alerted his nerves . He put a hand to the stock of his rifle , then stayed it . He could feel the weight of his pistol and sat quietly , listening . No sound . . . . Touching a heel to the ribs of the black , he started forward , holding to the thickest stand of trees . He sat up straight , weaving among them , emerging suddenly into a small clearing . He crossed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the cliffs . Again he paused to listen , studying the narrow opening before him . Chantry swore softly under his breath . He had no love for such places . A man up in those rocks with a rifle ... . He rode forward swiftly , trotted his horse to the gap , and then started up . It was a steep climb , but the sooner up the better . Topping out at the head of the draw he rode switftly into the trees , then drew up and dismounting , tied his horse with a slipknot as usual and walked back through the trees . Taking a careful look around , he then moved to the head of the draw and crouched down among the brush and rocks , waiting . Several minutes passed wih neither sound nor movement . Confident that he had not been followed , he moved back into the trees . Mowatt now knew the cabin was there . If he had n't already torn the place up looking for what he hoped to find , he almost surely would . Waiting where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knew of his brother . Had Clive hidden it there ? Or had he hidden it elsewhere ? Clive had always been a cautious man , who left no page unturned , no aspect unregarded . What could the clue be ? And where ? He and Clive had been much apart , yet there had  | always been understanding between them , and a taste for the same things . Clive had been more bookish and , if anything , even more of a loner than Owen . His love for wild country had been deep and abiding . His understanding of it , also . There had been a kind of poetry in the man . He was a man who could live richly and well without money , as long as he had wild country and books . He must try and place himself in Clive 's position . Clive had not intended to leave here , but to stay . He would have considered all aspects of what that meant  --  including being killed or dying . He would have planned to leave some word behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a careful way through the aspens . It was no simple thing , for the trunks stood close together , and there were many deadfalls . The wood of the aspens broke easily and was subject to attacks from insects as well . Consequently they fell , making travel difficult . Many wild flowers that grew under the aspens sprang up quickly as a rule . It was an unexpected route he was taking , so his tracks might not likely be found . When he drew near the cabin he dismounted and led the black into a shadowed place where the growth was thick . He tied it , leaving line enough so the gelding could crop the grass and flowers close by . Moving out of the aspens into a thick stand of spruces , he worked his way closer to the cabin , then squatted down and watched it for several minutes . His eyes searched the grass and could discern no evidence of passage since dewfall . No smoke came from the chimney . He must spend as little time as possible inside the 87  | cabin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each wall with a careful mental scrutiny . Then he devoted some time to the chimney , made of slabs of country rock , carefully fitted . He was mentally searching the cabin to cut down the time he must spend inside . But he found no likely hiding place there for treasure . The walls were solid  --  carefully hewn logs fitted with care and precision . The windows , of which there were three , were actually little more than enlarged portholes , a little taller than wide , each closed by solid shutters that were tightly fitted and doublelatched in the middle . They could thus be kept small , and the shutters could be set ajar to direct a breeze into any corner of the room . Yet the windows had been cut through solid logs and offered no hiding places . The hearth was possible . But knowing Clive , Owen dismissed it at once . The hearth was too apparent , and whatever Clive might do he would never be so obvious . No . . . it would had to be a clue that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some knowledge they shared ; something Clive would know Owen would understand and that would be understood by no one else . Rifle in hand , he left his cover and walked across to the cabin . Lifting the latch , he thrust open the door . It creaked on its hinges and swung slowly inward . The room was empty . Standing just inside the door , Owen Chantry listened , but heard nothing . A quick glance around the house showed no evidence of anyone 's presence there since his last visit . Turning slowly around , he looked for anything he might have missed in his mental survey of the cabin .  | He found nothing . Unless one tore the cabin down , the house could reveal no hiding place . The planks of the floor were tightly fitted . The flagstones of the hearth offered no hidden crevice . Where then ? For a moment Owen stood looking out the doorway , across the grass and into the distance . Then he looked through each window . He saw the timber from which he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rugged mass of rock , trees and brush . If he knew what he was looking for , it might be helpful , he thought wryly . If he knew the size , the kind of thing . But he had no clue . The number ten written on a step . . . . A clue ? Or something just written there in passing .. . Ten what ? Ten feet ? Yards ? Miles ? And in which direction ? Chantry studied the earth outside , made a circle of the cabin , ten feet out from its sides . . . . Nothing . He tried to find ten trees , ten rocks , anything in some shape or design or line that might provide the answer to that mysterious ten . He found nothing . He looked up . There was a loft , or at least an air space between the ceiling and the peaked roof . He saw no sign of an opening , yet it could be there . Suddenly he heard a horse approaching . Turning quickly , he glanced through the window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mane and tail  --  a long , rangy horse built for speed and staying power . The man looked to be around forty-five ... perhaps a year or two younger . He drew up outside . " Chantry ? " Owen Chantry stepped to the door , and they studied each other . The stranger was a quiet-seeming man with strong 89  | features and blue gray eyes . On this morning , he was unshaven . His gray handlebar mustache was shapely , however , and he was dressed neatly if roughly . " I am Frank Mowatt . " " I 've heard good things of you , " Chantry said quietly . " Marny Fox said them . " " She is with you ? " " With the Kernohans , I hope . " The question had surprised him . He had supposed she was with them , as she was not here . " No , I just come from them . . . near them , at least . She is n't there . " " And she 's not with you ? Your outfit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That does n't make sense . If she 's not at one of those places , then where can she be ? " Frank Mowatt 's worry was apparent . " Look , Chantry , we may shape up to be on opposite sides in whatever happens next but I 'm for that girl . She 's a fine girl , and her mother was a fine woman . I want you to know . " " We wo n't argue the point , Frank . There 's no reason she should be caught in the middle . I 'm with you all the way , as far as Marny is concerned . Now all we 've got to do is find her . " Frank Mowatt shoved his hat back on his head . " She come to me last night . Said she was pullin ' out . I told her it was the smartest thing she could do . Said she was tellin ' nobody else . Well , I got to worryin ' about it and went to her shack . " She was gone , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she aimed to take . I started out to trail her , but lost her sign back yonder on Turkey Creek . I cast about but could n't find no tracks , so I decided to ride on over to the old Chantry place . She was n't there . so I hunted for this place . "  | Owen Chantry frowned . He looked up suddenly , " Frank , are any of your outfit missing ? Tom Freka , for instance ? " " Why him ? " " He 's had trouble before . A dance-hall girl was killed down Fort Griffin way . The murder was never pinned on Freka , but a good many figured he was guilty . " " I did n't see him around , but that do n't cut no ice . I do n't see much of either him or Strawn at any time . " Chantry waited , thinking . There was a kinship between himself and this man , this tired , lonely man tied by a blood relationship to men who seemed not to be his kind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where could she go ? Obviously , she 'd try to ride to the Kernohans . They were close and she knew them , and she also knew Owen Chantry . Knew him ? Well , possibly not . At least , they had talked . They had seemed to share a certain unspoken understanding , a certain warmth . Was it only their loneliness ? Or was it something more ? One thing was certain : She must be found ; she must be protected . It was a curse of the Chantrys  --  and perhaps of all the Irish  --  that they belabored themselves with sorrow and old sadnesses , old griefs . " Go back , Frank . If she returns , she 'll need you . " " I could do nothing for her . Among us it is my father who decides . " " Even over the will of Strawn ? " Frank Mowatt stared at him . " Can you doubt it ? If you can , you know nothing of Mac Mowatt . Wherever he is , he is in charge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , Frank . I may have to come your way . " " They 'll kill you , as they did your brother . " " If they kill me , Frank , I promise you this , you 'll have some dogs to bury at my feet . Do n't judge me by what happened to Clive . He was more trusting than me . . . and not nearly so good with a gun . " " Strawn said you were good . Very , very good . " " I 'm not proud of it . I do what has to be done when the moment comes . And no more than has to be done . I 'll find her , Frank . " " Are you in love with her ? " " I would like to find out . And so , perhaps , would she . It is not an easy thing to know . " Frank nodded . " Yes . I do know . . . . There is compassion , sympathy , companionship . All are important , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Frank ? " He turned to look at Chantry . " Ca n't you talk some reason into them ? I do n't think there 's any treasure here . Nothing they could possibly want . They do n't even understand anything but gold or treasure or money of some kind . " You do n't think there 's treasure buried here ? " " Why the hell would Clive bury it ? If there was treasure  --  and if he was a man who valued such things  --  he would n't bury it . He 'd take it to where he could spend it . " " But if he did n't have time to get away ? " " Think , man . He had time to build this place , and believe me , for a man working alone that took time . You 've worked with tools . He had to have time ; he had to have patience . " " What could it be besides gold ? " " What I 've said . We Chantrys have a love of his-  | tory , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some odd fragment to an unfinished piece of history , something in the way of a clue . " " You do n't know that . " " No . . . I do n't . But I do know my family . And although we 've sometimes had money we 've never placed much store on it . " Frank chuckled , suddenly . " Be a joke on Pa .. . and them . " He smiled a rare smile , then shook his head . " They 'd never believe it . " " Do you ? " Frank hesitated . " I do n't know . . . maybe . " He looked embarrassed . " I never had no education to speak of . Most of two years of schooling and some newspaper reading here and there . I read a whole book . Never did own one though . " Owen Chantry felt the man 's half-understood longing for something beyond what he knew . " There 's no end to what a man can learn if he 's of a curious mind , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blessed , or cursed , with such minds . " " You better light out , " Frank said , suddenly . " They do n't aim to wait around . You 're here , and they figure you know something . They 'll be out to either kill you or make you talk . " " I 'll be around , " Owen replied coolly , " but I like you , Frank . I think you 're a good man , too good for that lot . Do me a favor . . . do n't stay with them . " Frank looked around at Chantry , as he turned his horse . " They 're my family , " he said . " I 'll ride with them . " And he rode off , walking his horse , then lifting it to a trot . Owen Chantry watched him go , then turned back to the cabin . Once more he looked quickly and carefully around . 93  | Nothing . . . not a clue . If there was anything left here it would n't matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Clive 's thinking , they would not either . He went outside and crossed to the trees where his horse was waiting . It was time to go . First , before anything else , he must find Marny . Fear mounted inside him , fear and helplessness . Where , in all this empty land , would he find her ? 10 Owen Chantry rode his black horse north . Too much time would be lost in returning to the Kernohans to tell them of his intentions . It was better that he did n't . It would be just like Doby to try to follow , and Owen wanted no interference . Big country it was , a vast and empty country . He rode due east as the country would allow until he struck a north-south trail , the one he had first followed to the cabin on the rampart . Now he turned north . Frank 's tracks were in the trail dust , and Owen rode swiftly , noting by the tracks that Frank had also traveled fast . Chantry was riding into enemy country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready for action  --  or , if need be , to leave the horse and take to the timber . The tracks of another horse came off the mesa north of the box canyon and cut into the trail . This rider , whomever he was , had been just ahead of Frank . The air was cool and very clear . During a pause to study the trail ahead , Chantry took a deep , long  | breath of the fresh mountain air . Judging by the growth about him , he must be almost ten thousand feet up . High overhead , an eagle circled against the blue . In the distance thunder rumbled . . . the usual afternoon rain shower would be coming . Lightning hurled its flashing lance against the darker clouds . His black moved on , of its own volition , and Chantry let the gelding go , ears pricked , aware of its rider 's alertness . He shifted the rifle in his hands . The trail he now rode was fresh . The trail forked suddenly , and Chantry drew up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The water was clear and cold , running swiftly over and among the rocks . He crossed over and went up the far bank . He rode up the trail , studying the tracks . Five horses . . . and one that held to the outside of the trail , the prints were clearly visible in the grass and wild flowers . He had seen the tracks of Marny 's horse before , and he believed he was looking at them again . He moved swiftly , deeply worried now . He was in the bottom of the canyon , which at this point was close to a half mile wide . He forded another creek coming down from the high country and went up the canyon wall through a gap where the wall had fallen back from its usual line and was somewhat lower . Suddenly the tracks changed . For an hour , Chantry examined them . All the horses had started to run . How long ago ? An hour ? Two hours ? Longer , surely , than that . Apparently the rider of the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been Marny , had sighted her pursuers and broken into a run . At  | a dead run , she had ridden a twisted , winding trail down through the trees toward a large clearing , and here and there her horse had actually leaped over deadfalls . Then , suddenly , at the crossing of another trail that skirted the large clearing , the tracks of her horse just vanished ! The pursuers had apparently reined in , too , studying the ground . The trail that Marny had come to led east and west , but which way had she taken ? Where had she gone ? Her pursuers had turned to the west , riding hard . Owen Chantry took his time considering , for he did not wish to make the mistake they had made . Marny 's life might depend upon it . They had made a mistake , for their own returning tracks were here and there imprinted upon their outgoing tracks . Still Chantry had not moved . Slowly he began to cast about . She was an uncommonly shrewd girl , who knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thought , having gained a little time , to lose them . He had to guess . . . . He had to surmise what he could not know . He turned west , climbed over the end of a comblike ridge that pointed north from the mountain ahead of him  --  a peak that looked to be thirteen thousand feet high or more . He crossed another meadow at a fast trot , watching the grass for any sign of passage , and skirted another lake . Suddenly he was on a trail , a dim trail , long unused . It led north past some beaver ponds and some standing but stark dead trees , and into the deepening shadows of the forest . Here it was damp and cool . He could smell the forest itself , the pine smell , the spruce smell , the  | smell of crushed greenery and the faint perfume of flowers . He drew up sharply . A sound . . . something moving . His gelding snorted and tried to turn , and then he saw it . A huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse and weighing half again as much . The bear was in the trail before them and showed no inclination to move . Owen spoke softly , calmly , to his horse and kept the rifle in his right hand . The horse stirred its hoofs , eager to be off . The bear stood up , staring at them through the vague half-light . " It 's all right , boy , " Chantry said calmly , speaking both to his horse and the bear . Then he added , and he spoke only to the bear , and a littler louder . " We 're not hunting trouble . You go your way and we 'll go ours . " A bear does not charge when standing on two feet , and the big grizzly was probably more curious than anything else . A bear prefers ants , grubs , berries , nuts , and roots , and only a few become consistent meat eaters . The black gelding reared , snorting . The bear looked a moment longer as the gelding 's hoofs came down to the trail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but keeping his rifle ready . At that distance , if the bear should elect to charge , they were in plenty of trouble . A bear can move fast for a short distance , and this one looked to be a monster , although in the dim light he probably looked larger than he was . The gelding was fast and could turn on a dime . It might be best to chance a shot and run , but the path beyond the bear was where Chantry wanted to go . Finally , after what seemed a very long inspection 97  | and when Chantry could hear the bear sniffing to study their scent , the big bear turned calmly and walked into the woods . Chantry waited , holding the horse steady until he heard the sounds of movement die away . Then he rode on down the trail . " No use to get spooked , " he said , speaking aloud to the horse . " He was just curious . Now it was too dark to see tracks , and Chantry trusted to the gelding . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its ears and actions Chantry would know if anything was close by that needed his attention . He rode on , walking his horse along the uncertain trail . Night when it came was cold . A small wind crept down from the icy peaks above . Timberline was only a thousand feet above him , more or less , and a vestige of last light clung there . He made his camp by moonlight , gathering his wood from the broken bones of fallen trees . He could hear running water from some small stream of melting snow , and where the shelter was best he built a small fire and made coffee . He chewed on a strip of jerky and looked out across the vast blackness toward the stars in that grayer blackness overhead . How many lonely campfires ? How much incense offered the gods of desolation from his nightly resting places ? And how many more to come ? He smiled wryly and got out his frying pan . He pushed a couple of pine cones into the flames to make the fire flare up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finding Marny Fox and afraid he might never find her . He shaved bacon into the pan and put it up on a couple of rocks and watched it bubble and spit .  | " Hello , the fire ! " A voice called from out of the night and the cold . " Come in , if you 're of a mind to . And come any way as suits you . " A horse walked up to the fire , a gray horse bearing a gray man in the saddle . A gray old man in buckskins , with young gray eyes a-twinkle in an old gray face . " Seen your fire , " the old man said . " Figured you was wishful of compan'y . " " I was , but I was n't expecting you . I was expecting trouble . " " Seen a mite of it , myself , time to time . I do n't know 's I care for no trouble , but the smell of bacon an ' coffee is durned near worth whatever comes . " " Get down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chantry watched the old man with a careful eye . He carried a Sharps .50 and a bowie knife , at least . If he had a handgun , it was not in sight . " These are lonely hills , " said Chantry . " They was , " the old man said , fussing with his saddle . " They was almighty empty for many a year . A man could live out his time ' thout bother from other folks . I seen more folks t'day then I seen all year . " There was sign along the trail , " Chantry commented . " You betchy , " the old man muttered . " They 'll be blood on the rocks afore we see the last of that outfit . Blood on the rocks for sure . " " Four men ? " Chantry suggested . " Aye . Four of ' em . Mean an ' miserable , too . I seen ' em an ' got off into the rocks and hunkered down with old Mary here . If they 'd a come at me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I never took nothin ' from their likes  | and ai n't about to . I 'd of hung their hair to dry on a tall pole or a tree somewheres . " " Where are they now ? " " Four , five mile down the mountain and west . I come up the mountain to be rid of them or their breeze . Then I fetched a sight of your fire , and I looked about to see who else was up . " " Did you see anyone else ? " " Ai n't that enough for one day ? Mister , I been years up and down these mountains , ai n't seen nobody . Did n't want to see nobody . I seen a man two year back over on the Animas , an ' I reckoned that was enough . Now all to oncet they 're a-comin ' out of the rocks , all around . Gettin ' so a man ca n't find no peace . " You better ride high and camp high from now on . That 's a bad outfit down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I seen ' em . " " You did n't see anyone else ? A lone rider , maybe ? " The old man walked up to the fire and speared a rasher of bacon from the pan with his bowie knife . He peered at Chantry from under gray brows . " Was you lookin ' for somebody ? " he asked , peering . " I am , " Chantry replied . " I 'm looking for a girl . And I 'd better find her before those down below do . She 's who they 're hunting for . " " Are they now ? Well , why do n't you an ' me just slip down there ' fore daylight and shoot the four of ' em ? Save trouble . " " Shoot them ? In cold blood ? " " Cold blood ? I do n't know if their blood is hot or cold or lukewarm . They 're varmints . Varmints . I could read their sign and smell their smell . Shoot ' em , says I. Shoot ' em down an ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done it my'self , only one man ca n't no-  | ways get off four shots fast enough . You got you one o ' them six-shootin ' pistols an ' a repeater . Hell , if I had a repeater they be dead by now . " " That 's a lovely lady they 're chasing , " Chantry said . " I 'd not want her in their hands . " " Shoot ' em . Stretch their hide . They ai n't no good . Not one mother 's son of ' em . Shoot ' em , I say . " He ate his bacon and speared another slice . Chantry took up the slab he had and sliced off half a dozen more . " Seen you huntin " em , " the old man said , past a mouthful of bacon . " Watched you from up yonder . " He gestured toward the high peaks . " Had m ' glass on you . " " Glass ? You 've got a pair of field glasses ? " " Nope . I got me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his pack and from a roll of blanket extracted a four-foot seaman 's telescope of a type Owen Chantry had not seen since he was a boy , and it was an antique then . " With this thing I can see from here to yonder . I was a-watchin ' you afollerin ' them . I watched them , too . I seen ' em huntin ' that girl . Seen her give ' em the slip . " He demolished the rest of the bacon and wiped the blade of his bowie on his sleeve , then sheathed it . " Come daylight , you an ' me an ' that girl can meet up . I know a way off this mountain that 'll bring us to her before they get there . " " We 'd better , " Owen said quietly . " That 's a bad outfit . " The old man studied him . " You kin to that Chantry feller had the ranch ? " " I am . Did you know him ? " " Know him ? I should smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to these mountains with him and ioi  | helped lay the timbers of his cabin on the rampart . I knew him . Good man . " Owen Chantry stared . This gray old man had known Clive Chantry . Owen Chantry had seen too much to doubt too much . He was intelligent . He had a healthy vein of skepticism , but he had traveled too widely and read too much not to understand that the seemingly impossible could happen . As the old man ate and talked , Chantry watched him thoughtfully . The old man was quick and active , also very thin , wiry , and strong . The oldest people Chantry had known all lived at relatively high altitudes , where many illnesses simply do not exist because the germs that spread them are not active in that cold , clear air . Or perhaps there were simply fewer people to harbor the germs . " If you know a way to head them off , we 'd better get going early , " said Chantry . The old man looked over his shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , I 'd be too . Them as follers her are a mighty poor lot , a sorry lot " Chantry pushed a few heavier sticks into the fire , then stretched out . He was tired . . . he had n't realized how tired . Yet he slept , and well . It was still dark when he heard the old man breaking sticks . When Owen raised up , the old fellow glanced over . " Seen you had coffee , " he said . " Ai n't had much lately . Git some chicory in the woods , time to time , but it ai n't the same . 102  | Chantry sat up , shook out his boots carefully to be sure no wanderers had taken shelter there during the night , and tugged them on . He did n't know this old man and prefered to make the coffee himself . The fire blazed up brightly . Chantry glanced around . It was a perfect camp , sheltered from the wind , partly sheltered from rain , with wood and water . When he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his bed . The old man went about his business as if alone , taking his horse to water and returning to pack up . Owen did the same , and when they had eaten he kicked earth over the fire . When Owen would have dumped out the coffee , the old man insisted on keeping the grounds , wrapping them carefully in a piece of well-tanned hide . " Ai n't tasted coffee in a spell , " he said . " Might be a long time agin . Out here I do n't throw nothin ' away ' til it 's plumb used up . " They started out . The old man led them at a good fast walk down a very steep trail for a hundred yards or so , then at a canter along a gradual slope . The shot came from afar . A single shot , and then silence . The old man pulled up sharply . Chantry 's eyes swept the country in a quick , measuring glance . All was still . There was no movement , no further sound . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but in the clear air the sound might have carried for some distance . Chantry started forward again , the only sound the swishing of the horses ' hoofs in the grass . He held his rifle in his right hand , ready for use . Then right before them , he saw the tracks of several hard-ridden horses . Grass was torn and earth kicked up where the hoofs had dug in . Men riding 103  | that hard were going straight to an objective , and not in doubt about it . Suddenly , half a mile away and racing across a meadow , he saw three riders , two bay horses and a buckskin , running all out . The old man spoke up suddenly . " Chantry , if I cut out , do n't you worry none . I 'll be around about " " Just do n't get in the way , " Owen replied . " You do what you 're of a mind to . " " What you figurin ' on ? " " I 'm going in and get that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " No . . . . But look at that rocky knoll yonder ? The one covered with aspens . There 's been a blowdown hit that slope . See the dead trees ? My guess is she 's there , trying to make a stand . " " Yeah , " the old man said . " They 've left one man to pin her down while they try to outflank her . Do n't you go gittin ' yourself killed . I ai n't much hand at goin ' agin three , four men single-handed . If n I was huntin " em , now .... " " Hunt them then , but stay out of range . When I go in there I do n't want to think about where else my bullets are going . " Chantry walked his horse forward , sitting straight up in the saddle , missing nothing . He was reminded of a time during the war when he was outside Chattanooga . He had led a cavalry charge against a crossroads position , and they had come out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in position below . But this was war of another kind , and he commanded no company . There was only himself and one old man of whom he knew nothing . He began to trot , his eyes searching for the fourth man . 104  | He heard a shot and saw a puff of smoke from the knoll under the aspens . Almost instantly the hidden marksman replied , and then Chantry saw him , hunkered down behind a mound of earth and brush , lifting his rifle for another shot . Owen wheeled his horse , the packhorse following , and went in at a dead run . The man heard him coming too late . Wheeling around , he drew up his rifle for a shot . Yet the turn and the lift of the gun were too fast . The rifle went off before it was fairly lined up , and the next instant Owen rode in up on him , firing with his rifle downward , shooting with one hand . The man jerked back , spun and dropped . He started to get up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around him . He 'd been hit , all right . Blood stained his shirt and pants right about the beltline on the right side . " You played hell ! " he said . The man was a rough-looking fellow , but unfrightened . " You surely bought yourself a ticket ! " he said angrily . " The old man will have your scalp for this . " " Does it take four of you to round up one little girl ? " Chantry asked . " Are you Owen Chantry ? " " I am , and that girl is to be left alone . You under-stand ? " The man spat . " You better tell them yonder . They ai n't about to leave her alone . They done had enough of her uppity ways . Who does she think she is ? " " Why do n't you ask Mowatt ? " Chantry suggested . The man spat again . " Hell , Mowatt do n't know what 's good for him . That girl ai n't no kin . " The man was clasping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked the initial shock was wearing off . The pain was growing and he squinted his eyes against it , not wanting to let Chantry see . Out of respect for the man , Chantry turned away . But as he rode off he kept an eye on him to see that he did n't reach for a gun . But the man was wholly concerned with his wound and did n't again look up . Chantry rode forward , and there were no shots . As he mounted a small knoll he glimpsed Marny 's horse , deep inside a clump of trees . " Marny ? " he called softly . " Come on in , " ? she spoke just loud enough for him to hear . " Although you 've come to a poor place . " He rode in through the trees and swung down . She got up from a tangle of fallen logs . There was a smudge on her cheek and the skirt she wore was rumpled . " Are you all right ? " he asked . " So far , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . " He glanced around quickly . The clump of trees was no more than fifty or sixty feet across , any way you looked , and there were a good many deadfalls and several clumps of boulders . The field of fire in most directions was good . " They 'll come . But when they find out you 're not alone , they 'll pull out . Then we 'll have to run for it . " She glanced at him . " You need n't , you know . I can get along . " She thought again how cold his face was . It was hardboned and strong , but there was little warmth in it until he smiled . There was loneliness in it , too , yet nothing about him invited sympathy . This was a man who had been much alone , with no experience at sharing feelings  --  probably because there had been nobody to share them with .  | " You 've always been alone , have n't you ? " she asked . He shrugged , watching the timber across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somebody you do n't trust . " " You 've never learned to share your feelings . " " Who wants my feelings ? A man alone keeps his feelings to himself . " She saw a movement among the leaves . " There 's somebody over there . " " I see . " " Are you going to shoot ? " " Not until I see what I 'm shooting at . Anybody who shoots blind is a fool . Something moving in the brush may be your best friend . Whenever I squeeze a trigger I know what I 'm shooting at . " " But we do n't have any friends here ! " " There 's Doby . And his Pa . . . . And that old man I met last night . " " Old man ? " " He knows you . He 's got a telescope , and there 's not much he does n't know . . . He 's also got a Sharps fifty . " " How old is he ? " " Looks like he was here first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's spry . . . he 's mighty spry , and canny . " There was a yell off to their right , and when Owen turned they were coming ... all three of them . They were well scattered and coming in at a dead run . Chantry lifted his rife like a man shooting ducks , and he fired left , middle , and right . There was no wasted motion , and no emotion . He just lifted the rifle and came down on his targets , held up the merest second and squeezed off his shots . The first man veered sharply and dropped his rifle , 107  | then fell down the slope and into the bottom . The second man dropped from the saddle , hit the grass , and lay there . The third wheeled his horse wildly and tried to escape . Chantry let him have three good jumps while he held his fire . Then he shot . " I held high , " he explained , apologetically . " I might have shot through him and killed a good horse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field , but the man rode limply , one arm dangling . " Only the horse ? Not the man ? " " The man came a-hunting trouble . He rode after a lone woman and he brought plenty of help , so whatever he gets is too good for him . The horse did n't have a choice . He was ridden into this fight , so there 's no use for it to suffer . " Chantry loaded his rifle again . " If you want to dance , you pay the fiddler . Only in this dance , " he smiled at her , " in this dance the devil does the fiddling and you pay in blood . " He glanced around the rocky , tree-covered knoll . " I like this place . When you pick a place to make a stand , you do all right . " The last echoes of the firing had died away . Not the faintest smell of powder smoke remained . It was as if nothing had happened . Only the body lying out there in the grass said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It would still be like this when they were gone . The few scars they left would be erased quietly . Even if left unburied the body would be disposed of in time , and after many years only a few buttons and perhaps a buckle would remain . Men would come , would pass , and where they walked the grass would grow again , and the forest , and there would be no signs of their passing . io8  | " We 'd better go , " he said . " There 's been enough of this . " " They wo n't stop , you know . Mac Mowatt is losing control . They will want blood now . They 'll come after you , Owen , and they 'll come after me . But it 's the treasure they want . " " Treasure ! " he was irritated . " The treasure is out there , " he waved a hand . " The treasure is the country itself . " He helped her to the saddle , then mounted and picked up the leadline of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meadow . Suddenly the old man came down from a clump of spruces across the way . He rode up to them and reined around , staring angrily at Chantry . " Might o ' left me one ! " he said . " You cleaned house ' fore I got my fifty up . I d'clare , I never seen such shootin ' . You an ' me , we could make us a passel out on the buffalo grass . Owen Chantry led away to the south . He was withdrawn , not wanting to talk . Fighting had been a way of life for as long as he could recall , but he wanted no more of it . Sensing his mood , Marny said nothing . Against the far-off horizon the Sleeping Ute Mountain bulked large and , nearer , the great shelf of Mesa Verde thrust out , sharp against the sky . " Do you know what they say ? " she spoke suddenly . " We had a half-breed Navajo with us for awhile . He said there were ghost cities up there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and still . " Owen 's eyes turned toward the bulk of the great plateau . " Could be , " he said , " though it 's a less favored place than the mountains we 've come from . " The old man disagreed . " Depends on what you 're 109  | lookin ' for . If you 're in a country where there 's savage Indians , fighters like the ' Paches and the Navajos , then maybe you want a place you can defend . " Owen Chantry offered no comment . He had been looking far off , and now he drew up on the edge of a slight shelf that offered a good view to the west . Far off against the sky a slim column of smoke was rising toward the sky . Chantry swore softly , bitterly . Startled , Marny said , " What is it , Owen ? " " They 've fired the ranch , " he said . He pointed to the smoke . " It 's burning . . . or has been . " " What about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . " I do n't know , " he said . " I just do n't know . " 12 Pa was just a-gettin ' hitched up when I seen ' em comin ' . He had the harness on when I glimpsed the dust on the trail , an ' I yelled at him . " Pa ! The Mowatt gang ! " Well , I never seen him act so fast or so sure . I did n't know he had it in him . Pa seemed to me a ord'nary sort of man , and when I picked out heroes he was n't among ' em . But he wasted no time . The saddle was already on my horse for I 'd been fixin ' to take off yonder to the hills . Pa had bound me up tight round the chest and waist , like I was in a cast , and although he did n't know what I aimed to do , he wanted my ribs to knit nice and clean so he done what seemed best to him . So my horse was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bullets . An ' a bait of grub . An ' when Pa seen that dust cloud he run for the house . no  | I started after him and he yelled back to turn the stock loose . That meant the cows he had up , the one we were milkin ' , and the heavy stock , so I threw down the corral bars and shied ' em out and into a run down the meadow . Pa come out with clothes and a few extries . He 'd been thinkin ' on this . That I figgered out after , ' cause he knew just what to take . He run for the horses . " Pa ! " I yelled . " What about the house ? " " We did n't have a house when we come here , boy , but we did have ourselves and our stock . Let 's go ! " We taken out . The way Pa led off I knowed he was n't just runnin ' wild . He had a bee in his bonnet and soon I seen what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canyon . Sometime or other he 'd found him a trail , and we went for it . Afore we got there , we rode through several big clump of trees , and he done what he could to cover our trail . Then he headed for that place he 'd found . Right where we hit the canyon she probably was n't much more'n fifteen hundred feet rim to rim , but she was at least five hundred feet deep . And both walls was covered with trees ' cept right at the rim . It was thick cover . We did n't waste no time . Pa went over that rim and dropped plumb out of sight . When I got that close I seen his horse slidin ' on his haunches down a trail that made you catch your breath to look at . I taken out after him . I was n't going ' to have Pa sayin ' I showed the white feather ' cause of no cliff . But I was sweatin ' blue water by the time I 'd gone down a hundred feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stream , that went rushin ' by  --  a fine trout stream if iii  | ever I seen one , and me with no pole nor no time to fish . Sometime or other , Pa had done some scoutin ' without sayin ' a word to me about it . He 'd been here afore and he led off almighty fast to a place where , some time or other , the stream cut back into the cliff to make of a holler faced off with trees . Some fallen logs had made a natural corral , and here we bunched our stock and Pa got down off his horse . " You stay here , Doby . I 've got somethin ' to do up yonder . " " You goin ' back , Pa ? " " They ai n't gon na burn that house ' thout me showin " em I disapprove , " he said . " I 'll just fire a few rounds and then come on back . " " I 'll go along . " " Now , son , you stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my years raisin ' you from a penny-grabbin ' , candysuckin ' kid to a growed up man just to see you killed by no outlaws . You set tight and I 'll be back , and then we 'll plan what to do . " " Pa , if'n you raised me to set still and watch my Pa go into a fight by hisself , you surely wasted your time . I 'm a-goin ' with you . " We went up together , me an ' Pa , and I never felt closer to him than right at that time . We went up together and we run back through the trees . The Mowatt gang was circlin ' round the house , yellin ' and shootin ' . There was smoke from the chimbly , and I guess they did n't know we was gone . It was too far away for good shootin ' , but we had to git back to that canyon if they took out after us , so Pa hunkered down among some rocks and he taken a long sight and 112 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jump in his hands and one of them horses eared up like it was burned and its rider went tumblin ' . Then you never seen folks scatter like they done . But not before I put in some lead . I 'd had my eye on one big gent with white suspenders , and I held my sight a mite below where those suspenders crossed on his back , and though it was a good long shot I tightened up the finger until that rifle went off . I did n't kill him , but I burned him . I made him know he 'd been shot at . I sent him a yippin ' out of there . But they kept ridin ' around . One of ' em throwed a torch at the house that fell on the roof an ' rolled off . Both Pa an ' me we opened up an ' dusted ' em around with lead . It taken ' em a few shots to realize we were n't inside but outside , and then they turned around and charged at us . Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must 've been fourteen or fifteen of ' em an ' they was all mounted up on fine horses and they come at us like cavalry chargin ' . It was a real sight . A better sight I never saw nor had , lookin ' right down the rifle barrel at ' em , and that time when I fired there was n't no mistake . A man just throwed up his hands and fell off his horse . He hit dust and rolled over and he lay all sprawled out . And Pa took a shot and then he said , " Son , let 's get out'n here . " So we taken off . We taken off a-runnin ' . Pa was a better runner than I thought . He was really a-leggin ' it when we heard a yell behind . They 'd seen us . " Here , boy , " Pa said . He dropped behind a log and 113  | he had n't hit dirt ' fore he fired . And me , I was just a hair behind him , firing standin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set the house afire . We could see the smoke goin ' up . Them riders split around us and we hightailed it . We was close to the rim then and bullets was kickin ' the dust all around us when we went over the rim and flopped down . We was shootin ' fast . They turned right and left into the trees and I started reloadin ' and looked over at Pa . And there was blood all over his shirt , and his face had gone white and me , I was scared . I crawled over to him and slung him over my back , and carryin ' both rifles I slid and fell and crawled to the bottom of the . canyon . It was no way to handle a hurt man , but I did n't have no choice . I got him to our corral and bathed off his face a little , then tryed to peel off his shirt . I got it off and his undershirt down to his waist . I seen the bullet had hit his shoulder bone and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his back a mite . It was pressin ' against the skin of his back , a bluelike lump , and I figgered the thing to do was get shut of it . So I slid out my bowie and cut a slit in the skin and the bullet , it just popped out in my hand . He 'd lost some blood . He 'd lost a-plenty of blood , but it did n't look to me like no death wound . Still , a body could n't be sure . So I plugged up the wound with pieces of his undershirt , bathed him off some , and stretched him out . The bullet hittin ' that shoulder bone must have been a shock ' cause he 'd passed out , somewheres . I taken his rifle and reloaded it and set a-watchin ' for the Mowatt gang . But did n't none of ' em come . 114  | I was all set for ' em , and I was aimin ' to kill me some men . But they never come . I guess they thought they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somethin ' . Or maybe they did n't relish comin ' into that canyon against two rifles that had the drop on them from the trees . So there I was in the bottom of Lost Canyon , with Pa bad off from lost blood and me not knowin ' a thing ' bout what to do . Time to time , I 'd figgered Pa did n't know much . But he was always able to patch up folks or doctor ' em somehow . And me , for all my windy talk , I did n't know what to do . Right then I surely was n't thinkin ' of no blonde and blue-eyed girls . I was just wishin ' I known what to do ' cause there was n't nobody else around to help . I kindled us a small fire and started heatin ' water in one of the kettles Pa had slung on the horse . I swear , he must have thought it all out ahead of time ' cause he 'd took along everything a body might need . Unpackin ' the horses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I come on a can of white powder Pa had been give by an old man once that was supposed to be good for bob-wire cuts . Now I 'd never seen no bob-wire , but I 'd heard of it , and a bob-wire cut was a scratch . And this here wound was n't too different , so when I 'd bathed it again , I scattered some of that white powder around it . Them days , when folks was far from doctors , they just concocted their own medicine , and some of it worked almighty good . I put on the coffeepot and scouted for firewood . And I built our cover a little higher . 115  | For all I knew they might just be a-settin ' up there atop the rim waitin ' ' til it was sure-enough dark to come at me . Leavin ' Pa for a moment I slipped down and got some water to heat up for broth after I 'd made the coffee . When I got back Pa was stirrin ' a mite . How long he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know . It might have been after the first burst of gunfire , but the way his clothes was soaked up with blood had scared me somethin ' awful . Nobody showed . I guess they never come down off the rim but I was n't taken no chances going up there . If they nailed me , Pa would be left to die down here . Or tough it out alone . So I set and waited and listened , longing for somebody to come . Only there was n't nobody goin ' to , ' less Owen Chantry come back , and he 'd not find us easy , way down in this hole . I was real scared for Pa and never felt so helpless in all my days . It was long after midday ' fore Pa opened up his eyes . I was right there with some coffee , and I held the cup for him and let him have a sip or two . " What happened ? " he asked . " You caught one , Pa . Ai n't too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sit quiet an ' rest . Ai n't nobody come . I got the stock took care of and some deefenses built up an ' the guns loaded an ' I been settin ' by just a-waitin ' for ' em to come . . . . " He closed his eyes , then taken a mite more of coffee . It seemed to do him some good , and so I shaved off some jerky into a kettle and stirred it up real good with a fire under it . Soon I 'd have us some broth . 116  | " Chantry 'll come , " he said . " We 'll be all right then . " Well , that sort of ired me . " He wo n't find us , if'n he does . An ' even if'n he does come , he 'll likely run afoul of them Mowatts . We got to set here til you feel better , then climb up yonder and get out of here . " " This here 's our home , boy . We 're not goin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build up that house again . I 've done wandered all I 'm a-goin ' to , son . I 've been a mover all my born days , but this here 's where I intend to stay . Maybe it ai n't the finest land , maybe its far from city places , but it 's land I can say is mine . We 'll stay . " By the time I 'd fed him all he would take of that broth , the sun was out of sight and shadows were climbin ' the walls of the canyon . I drank what was left . Then I taken the stock to water and found a patch of open grass along the stream . I dragged some poles into place and made a corral , using rocks , trees , and the side of the canyon . That would keep my stock a-feedin ' . Then I taken up my rifle . " Pa ? " I said . He answered somethin ' . Only what he said were n't right . He had him a fever and was wandering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the rim for a look around . I was turning back when I noticed the ears on Mary . Mary was a plow horse , and she was a big , powerful brute , but gentle as could be . And she could sense whatever was goin ' on around . Mary had her head and ears up . . . . Something was acomin . There was n't no sound . Not a smidgin . And I listened hard . Mary 's ears were still up , though she seemed less 117  | concerned . Maybe it was a varmint of some kind , a catamount , or the like . I started to set down my rifle when somebody spoke . " Doby ? Is it all right to come in ? " It was that Chantry . It was him , sure ' nough . " Come on in , " I said . I was never so relieved in all my born days . I was n't alone no longer with nobody to help with Pa but me . Chantry come out of the trees afoot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Then he come on up to the fire . He looked at Pa . " How bad is he ? " So I told him . Pa was sleeping , so Chantry said to let him sleep , which was the best doctor of all . But when Pa was awake he 'd have a look at the wound . And then he said , " Marny is with me , and an old man . " " An old man ? " " He 's been here in these mountains for years ... . Or so he says . " " I never seen no old man round here . You sure he ai n't one of them ? " " He 's not . We 've been doing some shooting of our own . " Chantry went to the edge of the woods and called softly . They come in . There was that girl , lookin ' tired-like but still almighty pretty , and an old , old man who looked like somebody had woke him up from his grave , he was that gray an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ' the way he taken for that coffeepot , you 'd a thought he owned it . " Get some sleep , Doby , " Chantry said to me . " I 'll look after your pa . " Well . . . I was tired . They built up the fire some and when I 'd stretched out to sleep they set around drinkin ' coffee . 118  | Our house had been burned , our stock scattered , an ' Pa was wounded . I had me a couple of busted ribs , and there was folks up on the canyon rim that wanted to kill us , but I slept . I just taken off to sleep , and it was full day ' fore my eyes opened up . And there was no more sound than nothin ' . I sat up and looked around . There was Marny Fox , a-settin ' by the fire . Pa was a-layin ' on the ground not far off , his head on a folded coat . Chantry was nowhere about . " Where 's Chantry ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Ai n't no house . He 's wastin ' his time . It 's done burned down . " " No , it is n't , Doby . The old man looked at it through his telescope and the house is standing . It 's been partly burned , all right , but it 's still standing . " Course , I should have maybe figgered on that . Heavy timbers like them would take time to burn . A sudden flash fire might not hold long enough to get them tight-fitted , squared-off logs to burnin ' . I went to the creek and splashed water on my face and washed my hands . I taken a mouthful of water and kind of sloshed it around inside , then spit it out . Then I combed my hair with my fingers the best I could . When I come back to the fire , Marny poured coffee for me . And about that time Owen Chantry come in with that old man who looked like the walkin ' dead . Chantry had an armful of books , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was all . " The house did n't burn , Doby . Only part of the roof and part of the porch . " 119  | " You saved you some books , " I said . " Is that all you looked for ? " " It 's Tennyson I wanted , " he said , " I. . . . " A kind of funny look come over his face , and he stared hard at Marny . " Tennyson . . . . Now that is a thought . " They were huddled together in a bunch . " I used to read , " Marny said , " but we 've few books here . If it was n't for Mac ? " " Mowatt reads ? " " As a matter of fact , he does . My feeling is , considering where he 's lived , he 's had a better than average education . " My brother liked Tennyson , " Chantry said , " and we had a mutual favorite , a poem called ' Ulysses . " It was n't the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was time to figure a way to get out of the fix . The Mowatts had bled and they 'd not take it lightly . They 'd come back . " I think we should pay us a visit to Mowatt , " said Doby . " Clive would have his own way of doing things , " Chantry mused , " and if he wanted to tell me someing he 'd have his own way of doing it . " " Them Mowatts got a way of tellin ' things , too , " Kernohan said , cross-like . " They 'll be comin ' back and here we set , like an or ladies ' tea party ! " " You 're right , of course , " Chantry said . " But I do n't think they 'll come now . Sooner or later , we must leave this canyon , and when we do it will be easier for them to attack . "  | Marny brought Chantry a cup of coffee . He took it gratefully and glanced over at Doby . Chantry knew the younger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was probably over Marny . Well . . . that was to be expected . The important thing was not to let it get out of hand . Chantry was , he knew himself , inclined to be impatient , but he must not be impatient with Doby , who was a good lad and had the makings of a man . Despite his assurances to the others , Chantry also knew the situation was uncertain . How much control could or would be exerted by Mac Mowatt remained to be seen . He was tired and he needed a shave . Suddenly , he was irritated . Doby was right . It was time to wind this thing up . " I 'm going to see him , " he said suddenly . They looked at him , uncomprehendingly . " I 'm going to see Mac Mowatt and have him call off his dogs . " " You 're plumb crazy ! " The old man spoke before any of the others could . " They 'd kill you afore you got to ' im . An ' he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could . " " We 'll see . " Marny was on her feet again . She was wide-eyed and still , staring at him . " They wo n't listen , " she protested . " They 'll kill you . " They were right , of course , but he was right , too . Mowatt might see reason . If he did , that would take most of the load off their backs , anyway . Getting to him would be a problem but , despite his normal caution , there was in Owen Chantry a streak of wild Irish rebellion  --  foolhardiness some would call it . Others would call it plain damn foolishness . . . . But 121  | it was his way to bow his neck and plunge in . And better him than the others . " They wo n't expect it , " he said , more quietly . " I could walk in on them . " " You can walk in , " Doby said grimly , " but you 'll never walk out again . " In a flash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 'd like that , would n't you . Doby ? " All their heads came up . Doby flushed . " Nossir , I would n't " he said . " You an ' me may not see eye to eye , but I 'd surely not like to see you get killed . I surely would n't . " " Doby swallowed . " Fact is , you go in there an ' I 'm a-goin ' with you , " Doby said . " I can shoot , an ' I can stand steady . You go in there with me an ' you 'll see you ai n't the on'y one 's got hair on his chest . " " I never doubted it , Doby , " Chantry said , sincerely . " But I 'll have to go by myself . After all , " he added , " it was my brother they killed . Whatever it is they 're looking for belongs to me . " " Maybe it does , " Doby said stubbornly , " an ' maybe it do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hid . So maybe it 's just treasure-trove belongin ' to the finder . " Chantry shrugged . " Wherever and whatever it is , " he said calmly , " my brother intended me to find it , and so he will have left it . " He wanted it over , done with . He was getting the old urge to get out , to leave . Yet how many times had he done just that ? Was that not , in itself , a form of cowardice ? Chantry brushed the wood ashes from his sleeve . He would need a new coat . This one was getting threadbare . He straightened it and walked over to his horse . This was no place to leave his friends , yet . . . . He glanced up the canyon .  | He hated to leave . Kernohan was hard hit . Reluctantly , Chantry gave up the idea of moving their camp . They would have to chance it here . " Sit tight , " he said , " I 'll go out and take a look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ em , I 'm comin ' along , " Doby insisted . " You stay . What about your pa ? " Doby looked trapped , but he argued no longer . " You 're takin ' a long chance , " he said . Chantry glanced over at Marny . " I 'll be back , " he said and , touching a spur to his horse , he started for the trail . He had no certain plan , nor could a plan be devised until he saw the situation at close hand . It was a good scramble for his horse to get up the trail to the top of the mesa , and Chantry dismounted and led his horse when they reached the crest . Birds were everywhere about . A squirrel sat on the ground near some rocks . Every move must be made with caution now , for the renegades who rode with Mowatt were frontiersmen , all of them . His only advantage lay in the fact that they might also be careless . He walked his horse in the deepest shadows , pausing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a vagrant but unfocused notion that kept slipping around at the edge of his mind . Every time he tried to pin the thought into position , to guide it into focus , it slipped away , eluding him . . . . Something about Tennyson and his brother and himself . They used to write each other letters . His horse walked softly through the grass and wild flowers that edged the woods . It was the long way around , but he had no desire to trust himself to the open out there , where the distance was shorter . 123  | When he was well away from Lost Canyon , he moved more swiftly . The air was cool , there was a dampness of dew on the underbrush now . Something stirred and he drew up suddenly . Several shadows moved out into sight . He waited , holding his breath . Then he slowly relaxed . . . Elk . They liked to feed in high meadows at night . He caught a faint smell of smoke . He waited , trying to locate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , keeping his eyes on its ears . The ears were up , and Chantry could sense the interest of his horse . It smelled something too . The smoke , other horses , or men ... . A faint breeze stirred the leaves , they rustled , and the breeze passed . He walked on , a few steps further . Chantry had a feeling he was near their camp , but so far he had no definite indication of it . He caught a gleam through the trees . . . water . He rode closer . It was a small lake , yet he still saw no fire , nor smelled any more smoke . He rode around the lake , taking his time . He glanced at the stars . He still had plenty of darkness before daybreak . Suddenly he caught a whiff of smoke again . . . very faint , but definite . It seemed to be coming from straight ahead . He kept in the darkest shadows and rode on . He saw the horses first , felt his own horse swell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy , " Chantry whispered . " Take it easy now ! " He wanted no whinny that would arouse the camp . Chantry stepped down from the saddle and with a slipknot tied his horse in the deepest shadows . They were downwind of the Mowatt horses , yet it could be only a few minutes , perhaps a few seconds , until they scented his horse .  | He glanced around at the sleeping camp . There was no guard , for obviously they doubted that anyone would have the courage to attack them . Chantry 's sense of the fitness of things rebelled at the careless , dirty , ill-kept camp . One by one , he let his eyes slide over the sleeping men until he picked out Mowatta bit to one side , an enormous figure of a man covered with a buffalo robe . Stepping lightly , Chantry walked right through the middle of the camp and squatted on his heels beside Mowatt . It was only then that he realized the old man 's eyes were open and on him , and that Mac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Mowatt , " he spoke softly . " Been watchin ' you , " Mowatt whispered and heaved himself up . " Been watchin ' you ever since you showed up ... listenin ' to you come afore that . Got ears like a cat , " he said proudly . " Always could hear more'n anybody else . " He rubbed his face , then squinted at Chantry . " You got you a nerve . . . ridin ' in here like this . When the boys wake up they 'll carve their names in your hide . " " In your own camp ? " Chantry acted surprised . " I understood you were the man in your outfit . Even an Apache respects an enemy in an Apache 's camp . . . " Some Indians do . All right . What d' ya want ? " " Marny tells me that you read . " " Read ? What in the hell 's that got to do with anything ? ' Course I read ! I had schoolin ' . Most of it 's been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reader . Had him a house full . Must have been eight or ten books . " " That 's why I came here . I want to talk to you before anybody else gets killed . There is no gold , Mowatt . There never was . " 125  | Mowatt snorted . " You ' spect me to believe that ? We done heard about this treasure already . How all that gold was brought up from Mexico ? " " All that gold ? ' Think , man . When my brother came into this country he came out of Mexico with one , maybe two pack mules . He had a small outfit , some grub maybe , and he rode through Apache country . There was no way he could have carried enough gold to matter , even if he had it . And I know enough about him to know that he never cared much for money . " If he 'd had any gold , why would he stop here ? Where he could n't use it ? Why stop here after riding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got you a point there . Always did wonder ' bout that . Figgered he was crazy or a miser or something . " " " I believe he brought something with him , " Chantry continued , " but I do not think it was treasure . I want to talk to you because you might understand , you might grasp the idea . . . which I am sure they , " Chantry gestured at the camp , " would not . " Although , " he added , " Frank . Mowatt might . " Chantry looked straight at Mac Mowatt . " You know , Mr. Mowatt , Frank is the best of the lot . He 'll stay by you because he 's loyal and a good son . But he 's the only one of you who 's worth a tinker 's dam , and that includes you . " Mowatt stared at him . " You got you a nerve . Talkin ' that way to Mac Mowatt . " Even Chantry was amazed at what he 'd said . " I had nerve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it or not , I 'll ride out , too . But I thought maybe I could talk some sense into you . You 've got a tough bunch of boys here , but you 'll waste them  | trying for something that would keep the least of you in whiskey for less than an hour . Believe me . " " You know what it is ? " " No . . . but I 've a hunch . My brother was interested in the old civilization of Mexico . He was a thoughtful , intelligent man . Most of us Chantrys have gone off wandering for no special reason , but when he went to Mexico and Central America , I think it was for a special purpose . And I think he found something down there that has some bearing on history . " Chantry paused . " He never cared much for money , and he passed up a dozen chances to have an easy life . All he ever wanted was to see what lay over the horizon , to study the ways of man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached for a boot . " Did you ride in here just to tell me that ? " " No . " The two were moving quietly away from the camp . " I wanted to talk some sense into you . I have nothing against you . So why should I kill you ? Or any of your outfit ? I came into this country to stay . I 'm going to hang up my guns and do some ranching . " " You ? " Mowatt was skeptical . " I 'd have to see that to b'lieve it . " " You should do the same thing , Mowatt . Get yourself some land while you can , settle down and raise cattle . " Chantry paused . He had to say it . " The real reason I came into camp tonight was because of Marny . " " Marny ? " The old man 's face turned toward him . " She 's got nothing to do with you . Do n't bring Marny into this . " " She has everything to do with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yesterday . They 'd chased her 127  | over a dozen miles of country . I killed one of them and put lead into three others . " " Marny ? My boys ? You lie , Chantry ! " His voice was choked up . Finally , he said , " What do you know about Marny ? " " That she 's a fine , beautiful young woman who respects and loves you , despises your outfit , and deserves a better chance . In fact , that 's the real reason I rode in here tonight . You 're her stepfather . I want to ask Marny to marry me . And I want your permission . " " You what ? " " You 're her oldest living relative . I suppose that legally you 're her guardian . So I came to you . " " Well , of all the damn gall ! You ? ! " Mowatt stared at Chantry , then began to chuckle . " I 'll be a yellerlivered coyote if that do n't take first prize ! You ridin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just to tell me that ! " " She 's a lady , " Chantry continued quietly , " and somewhere under that tough old hide of yours there used to be a gentleman . A man who knows how things should be done . " " You said anything to her ' bout this ? " " No . . . . She 'd be surprised . She might even laugh at me . But I had to do it " " Well , I 'll be damned , " Mac Mowatt threw his cigar butt into the ground and rubbed it out with his toe . " You 'd think we was back in Richmond or Charleston or somewheres like that " He shook his  | head . " No . . . you 're a gunfighting drifter , Chantry " " It would take a gunfighter to get her out of this . You 've lost your control . I ? " " Lost my control ? Like hell , I have ! I can ? " " I told you I was settling down . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off my back . " " What do you mean , I 've lost control ? " " Well , they went out after her , did n't they ? Said she was uppity , that they 'd just show her . " " I hope you killed that man . " " He took one in the leg that did n't do him any good , and so far as I know he 's still out there . " Then Owen Chantry got to his feet . " Now you know , Mac Mowatt . I want to court Marny , and I 've come to you as a gentleman should . You call off your boys , or there 's going to be war . " " How long do you think you 'd last ? " Mac Mowatt had risen too . " Jake Strawn is trouble . " " And Tom Freka ? " " I thought he was leading the chase after Marny . I 'm pretty sure he 's killed at least one woman . Get him out of the country or I 'll kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face . " Damnit , Chantry , I like you ! Damned if I do n't . You shape up like a man . But I 've got these boys . And when you lead an outfit like this you got to lead . You got to stay ahead of them . I du n no . . . I really du n no . Why do n't you and Marny light out ? There 's a preacher in the San Luis valley , and there 's always Santa Fe . " " This is my country , Mowatt . I 've come home . If your boys want war , they 'll get it . My advice to you is to latch onto Strawn . He and your son Frank are men . " 129  | Mowatt shrugged . His mind was made up . " You an ' them farmers do n't count for much , Chantry . Those boys will cut you down . " " Then it 's war ? " " It is , " Mowatt said . " But I 'll say this Chantry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her man , you 've got my permission . If it plays that way , Chantry , give her a good life . She 's a mighty fine young woman . " Chantry turned and walked into the trees . He had gained nothing . He worked his way back toward his horse , moving slowly , taking every precaution . Twice he paused to listen . . . ready for an instant shot . He caught the vague glisten of moonlight on the polished leather of his saddle and heard the black shift its hoofs . Something moved in the shade and a low voice said , " I always wanted to kill me a big man , one o ' them special fightin ' men . I always figgered they was just so much talk . You know who this is , Chantry ? This here is Thrasher Baynes , an ' I got you dead t ' rights ! " Chantry felt suddenly very tired . Almost bored . Would they never learn ? He wanted to kill no one . He had never wanted to kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the service of the law , but he had never , even as a boy , wanted to be known as a killer of men . Thrasher Baynes stood in the darkness . Thrasher Baynes had spotted him . He was expecting Chantry to reply , and he needed that reply to know exactly where he was . Owen Chantry waited , alert to the slightest sound . If Thrasher moved . . . . On his own right Chantry had a tree , on his left an open space some six feet across . And beyond that , his horse . 130  | Thrasher spoke again . This time his voice was a tone higher . " What 's the matter , Chantry ? You scared ? You too scared to talk ? I 'm a-gonna kill you , Chantry . " Chantry did n't move . His rifle was on that voice , his finger on the trigger , the slack taken up . . . . He was only a hair from firing a shot , and he knew when he fired he would fire three times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , and a third to the left . If his first shot scored and Thrasher started to fall , Chantry 'd have a good chance of nailing him a second time . " Yaller , ai n't you ? " They would all be coming now . It was only a matter of time . Chantry fired into the sound . Fired once , then as fast as he could work the lever , twice more . Then he walked to his horse , pulled the slipknot , and climbed into the saddle . Behind him something groaned and thrashed about on the ground . Then all was silent . Owen Chantry knew where the trail was and how it lay . He went down it at a dead run . He had done what had to be done . What happened now would be on their own heads . He had had no hope of talking them out of their battle . That would have been asking too much of human nature . Yet now Mac Mowatt had been told of the growing lack of discipline in his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but rode steadily onward . The air was cool , the light wind from off the mountains chilly . Bright moonlight bathed the trail . He had asked for a girl 's hand in marriage before he had even asked the girl , or even talked to her of 131  | love . Was he a fool ? Could she , or any woman , love him ? Was he the kind of man who would make a fit husband for Marny Fox . . . if he lived ? He had declared war . And although he might have help , it was a one-man war . They had killed his brother . It was his own land over which they were fighting . What his brother had left was his legacy , whether it was wealth or knowledge or a dream . The ranch house had not burned down . Its timbers were solid , allowing no air holes . Some had just charred . A part of the roof had burned , but a late afternoon shower  --  usual in these mountains  --  had put out the fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a few days , and clean up in a week . However , the place was exposed . They could not return there yet . They 'd come after him , the Mowatt gang . He dismounted and led his horse to water . Some distance away , he stretched out on the grass with his saddle for a pillow and watched the declining moon . He dozed , awakened to listen , and dozed again . He knew all the sounds of the night and what they meant , and his horse was alert as only a former wild horse is , having lived too long with danger . The nights when he slept through without awakening were few . He had taught himself to awaken at the slightest change in sound or air . When the sky was gray and the landscape still black , he got up , sat on a log , and tugged on his boots , stamping his feet to settle them well . He led his horse to water again , saddled up , and considered what lay before him . To kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had no wish for such an end . Yet he was one  | man alone , and the enemy was many . And victory would mean life for others than himself . He thought about these things ruefully . The only gallant and dashing thing about him at the moment was the fine black horse he rode . When he reached the house , he gathered a few half-burned rags and wrapped them up with string , the coarse twine Kernohan used to tie up bundles of corn . Then Owen Chantry mounted the black horse and rode into battle . There were no banners flying , but the Irish were accustomed to fighting gallantly for causes already lost . He was riding forth to battle . And his only weapons were wit and the bitter wine of his experience . 15 On his long night ride back from the ranch house , Owen Chantry had crossed Turkey Creek Canyon and turned west along the south rim , scouting it all the way to Lost Canyon . If they followed his trail , they would ride where he had ridden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because otherwise they might lose him . In a patch of woods overlooking his trail , but several hundred yards off , he dismounted . He caressed the black and talked to it . The horse turned its head and pushed at Chantry with its nose . The grass along these trails and back in the cul-desac was tall and dryer than elsewhere . There was sparse timber . He glanced at the sky . It was scattered with the usual white puffballs of cloud . By midafter-133  | noon they would bunch up and there would probably be rain . He knew a way to box them in . He saw their dust before he saw them . Just a thin trail rising up from the dry grass . He walked back to his horse , took up the reins , and mounted . They were following his trail , just as he intended . Putting a finger in his mouth he wetted it well and held it up . The wind was from the east , toward Lost Canyon . They 'd have a little trouble at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , bare rock , and the trail would be lost for a little way . When they had gone on by he rode down toward them . He would have to be quick , for the ride into and out of the cul-de-sac would be no more than a mile . He drew up when he 'd cut their trail and glanced along a line toward a smaller canyon . Then he struck a light and lighted a bundle he 'd made of dry cloth and grass . The bundle was big , and took longer than he liked to flame up . Then he got into the saddle and took a turn around the pommel with the other end of the twine . He walked his horse west , dragging the burning bundle . Behind him the grass caught fire and began to burn toward the rim . The wind was not strong enough , but it was there , and the fire would generate wind of its own . He walked the black along , and first the grass began to burn , then the brush . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other canyon rim . Then he loosed the twine and turned away , riding swiftly . A half mile off , he glanced back . Smoke was billowing up , and he saw a sudden arrow of fire as a tree loaded with sap exploded into flame . He knew he was n't going to burn them . They were  | too smart for that . They would find a gap in the line where the fire had not taken hold , or they would ride into the small lake near the rim . What he wanted to do was worry them , make them wonder what was coming next . He wanted them to know it was n't going to be easy for them . He wanted them to think about losing , about coming up with nothing for all their trouble , about dying . He wanted them to sweat . He wanted them to get so disgusted they 'd quit . He trotted the black , watching for the home trail . He had no fear of the fire burning over into Lost Canyon because of that strip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fire when I seen him coming down from the rim . Seems like no matter how long he 'd been ridin ' or where , he always sat his saddle like he was on parade . It bothered me some , but at the same time I envied him . He surely was a fine-looking man , even if he was wore out a little around the edges . " You smell that smoke ? " I asked him . " Nothing to worry about , Doby . It 'll burn out in a few more minutes . Marny came up from the stream , brushing her hair as she walked . The gladness in her eyes worried me more than Chantry . What did she see in him , old as he was ? " How 's Kernohan ? " Chantry asked . " He 's better . He 's had some soup and he drank some more coffee . I think he 's gaining a little . " She looked at him , his face haggard in the morning light . " Have you slept at all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ! " Enough . But if there 's anything to eat . . . " It 's ready . " 135  | " Where 's the old man ? " " He 's disappeared into the timber . " Trees shaded the ground , but there were spots of sunlight . Chantry ate a bit , then sat down under a tree , his rifle across his lap . He were n't never far from that rifle . And sleepy he might be , but when he woke up he was ready . Marny came up with a refill for his coffee , but he had his head back , plumb asleep . " He looks beat , " I commented . " Ridin ' all night , likely . I 'd give a coon to know what he 's been up to . " " I am glad he 's back with us , " Marny said . " Between the two of you and the old man ? " " I do n't cotton to that old man . Says he 's been around since Noah 's ark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know what he 's up to , but I do n't like it no how . . . or him either . " " Has he told you his name ? " " He 's mentioned a couple , but I do n't believe either one of ' em is right . He sorta smiled when he told me . Likely he do n't even remember . I do n't believe he 's been here long . We woulda seen him . " " Doby ? How many bears have you seen in these mountains ? " " Ai n't seen any . Nor cougars , neither , but they 're around here . " " That 's right . " Well , I taken another look at her . " I see what you mean , " I admitted , " you figger he 's like them . If I ai n't seen a bear or a cougar , that do n't mean they ai n't here . " She went over to where Pa lay . His eyes opened and he looked up at her . His mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like she 'd said . I was never no hand with sick folks and was uncom-  | fortable bein ' around ' em , because I never known what to do . Ever ' once in a while I figgered to ask Pa what a body did at them times , and I kept telling myself to listen and watch other folks . Womenfolks , they just seemed to know . But how , I never could figger out . Just come natural to ' em , I reckon . I taken my rifle and edged out toward the creek to where I could listen , but the creek was so noisy itself I could n't hear much . Yet I worked upstream about half a mile , but I could n't see nothin ' except plenty of trout in the stream . And when I got back to camp , Chantry was awake and cleaning his guns . I never did see a man fuss so much over guns . Them guns and his horse . I said somethin ' about it , and he looked up at me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man without a gun and a horse in this country is downright helpless . You take care of them , and they 'll take care of of you . " ' Course that made sense , but it was a mighty lot of fussing to do , seemed to me . Pa was always after me , too . Could n't bear to see a used gun set down without cleaning . The old man come back then , and he was chucklin ' . He filled his cup with coffee and kept looking at Chantry , chuckling some more . " You sure played hob , " he said . " You surely did . That outfit is fit to be tied . Run ' em all into the lake , you did , an ' some of ' em got in up to their ears . You fairly trapped ' em . " Well , when we asked him he told us about Chantry catchin ' them with a grass fire . " Taken a shot at ' em m'self , " the old man said , " just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mite far off for good shootin ' , but I burned one of ' em . Burned him good ... dropped his rifle an ' he taken off . He come 137  | back for his rifle after awhile , but somebody 'd snuck down there an ' packed it , packed it right off . " " Good ! " Chantry smiled . " A man does n't find a rifle every day . " He surely did n't , and I felt sorry for the man who lost it , at the same time thinkin ' it was one more we would n't have to worry about aimin ' at us . Chantry kept sizing up the old man and finally he asked him when he come into the country . That old man , he canted his head and his old eyes twinkled . He gulped down some more hot coffee an ' he says , " I do n't pay no mind to years . Ai n't seen a clock or a calendar since I was a boy . But this here much I 'll say . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already had hair on m ' chest . I was fit to handle m'self or anybody that come to catch me . Only nobody cDme . " " But you knew Clive ? " " I knowed him . Had his head in a book most o ' the time . But he was a good man for all of that . . . a good man . Kept the coffee on . . . never had to wait in his house . Rode with Clive once . Down in Mexico with another feller named Mowatt . But we got chased out . They ran us awhile , but one of Clive 's friends was an Otomi Indian . He knowed the country , an ' he taken us out . " We had us a fight an ' the Indian was killed , but ' fore he died he tol ' Clive ' bout some papers . He 'd seen him readin ' , so he told him his people had papers , too . Told him where they was hidden . . . . Old papers , and carvin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it no way but to go lookin ' , an ' sure enough , he found ' em . Was n't all he found , neither . He found a heap of grief and trouble . " Clive Chantry was the one built the cabin on the rampart . And buried or hid whatever it was . " 138  | " How much gold did he have ? " I put in . The old man chuckled . " Gold ? Laddie , you 'd of had a hard time fillip ' a thimble ! I know ! I was there ! We three had us some gold until the big fight in Mexico , an ' then we was lucky to get out with our skins ! We had us some horses and two mules , an ' we had some grub . We had powder an ' lead , an ' mighty little else . Gold ? I should smile ! " Well , there it was ! Unless this old man was a-lyin ' , or had found where the gold was hid and had it hid someplace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he might be , but he was no damn fool . He was smart as a hill-country fox . " I never heard of no Otomi Indians , " I muttered . " There are many tribes in Mexico , " Chantry said , " with many languages . I know nothing of the Otomis either , except that I 've heard their language is very different , with no kinship to the other Indian tongues . Of course , that may be just hearsay . " " That Otomi was a good man , " the old man said , " but he was a drifter and a wanderer , never stayed put nowheres . " " I still believe there was gold , " I declared . " Or gems and such . I do n't see why a man would waste his time totin ' old papers or whatever all the way from Mexico . What I want to know is where it was hid ? " The old man shrugged . " Who knows ? Clive was mysterious . Wherever he hid the stuff , nobody ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Chantry went off under a tree and rolled up in his blankets , and the old man , he just set awhile staring into the coals of the fire an ' talkin ' to hisself . I taken my rifle an ' started scoutin ' out again up toward the rim . When I finally got there I set down amongst the 139  | rocks and brush where I could see , and I started watchin ' the trails . That was a mean outfit and I did n't trust them no way at all . Chantry said he 'd talked to Mac Mowatt , but I did n't know whether to believe him or not . I did n't figger anybody could walk right into an outlaw camp and talk to the leader without getting killed . But maybe he done it . I could n't figure that old man out either . It was hard to believe he 'd lived in that country so long and we never even seen him . Yet it could be so . It was right what Marny said about bears and lions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could too . It made a body downright uneasy to think there 's folks around , peerin ' at him without him knowin ' . Made me look around . Settin ' there like that , nothin ' on my mind , thoughts kept edging their way up front , thoughts I 'd put out no welcome for . It kept nagging at me there might be men who set such store by papers they 'd risk their lives to save ' em . That was a new thing to me . Shifting my rifle , I squinted down the trail . No dust . No smoke . Yet somethin ' about that trail worried me . I ought a be thinking of meat , too . We did n't have much left . Maybe some fish . I could rig myself up a pole and catch a bait of mountain river trout , be mighty tasty . I taken another sight down trail and still seen nothin ' . I studied the country round , then backed out the brush and went down the trail to the Lost Canyon camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got there . " See anything , Doby ? " he asked . " All quiet , " I told him . " What you reckon they 're figurin ' on ? "  | " If they 're smart , they 're pulling out about now . But I do n't think they 're that smart , or that willing to believe they 've wasted their time . What they should do , not being smart enough to quit , is to hole up and hide out until I 've found whatever it is they think is so valuable . " " Might be a long time , " I said , thinking about that . For how could any man alive read the thoughts of a man long dead ? There were miles of country in which to hide something , clefts in the rock , hollow trees , boulders , places where holes could be dug . An ' I said so . Chantry agreed . " Clive knew me , and I knew him . He would think of something , some clue we would both understand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out from here . I 've got to go back to the cabin . I have to be where he was and try to think his thoughts . " " However could you do that ? " Marny asked . Chantry put down the cloth he 'd been using to polish his boots . " Put myself in his place . He may have known they would try to kill him . " Marny flushed . " I had no idea they 'd kill him . You see , they thought whatever it was was in the house .. . the ranch house . I thought so , too . " " So ? " Owen Chantry was lookin ' right at her , kinda cold and steady . " They told me they were going to kill him if he did n't tell them where it was , and I begged them not to . I 'd met him , you see , while riding . We 'd talked . ... He was much older . . . . He seemed much older than you , Owen . I liked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them . . . . Oh , I liked it ! I liked being treated like a lady , I liked listening to him . I was anxious to learn things . How to be a lady , how to act , what women wore . Clive seemed to know 141  | something about everything . Then they told me they were going to kill him , so I begged them to let me try to find it . They agreed . " So I went down . I told Clive I 'd run away , that I was afraid of them , and that much was almost true . I wanted to run away , but I was always afraid .. . always . " He let me stay there . He told me he 'd protect me until he could figure out how to get me away safely . And when he was out of the house , I looked for treasure . The only thing I ever discovered was that it could not possibly be hidden in the ranch house . " We used to talk a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of all , Owen , he talked of you . He 'd read poetry to me , and to himself , and he read other things . And when I realized he had nothing of value hidden in the house , I went to them and tried to tell them . I begged them , pleaded with them but they would n't listen . They thought he 'd made a fool of me . " Finally , Mac promised they 'd do nothing . Or I thought he 'd promised , at least . And then they killed him . And ransacked the house , and found nothing .. . nothing . " And he was dead . Clive Chantry was dead . " Mac Mowatt sat hunched on the butt end of a log in Hell 's Hole , a small hollow on the course of the middle fork of the range . Above him , the great bulk of the hogback loomed , rising over a thousand feet to its crest .  | It was not a good campsite and Mowatt was not in a good mood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words of the night before sticking like spurs into his brain . Suppose Chantry was telling the truth . Suppose all this searching was for nothing at all . Suppose all this waiting , all this grief , plus the loss of several good men , and the trouble they were in now was in vain . All of them had reached the lake before the flames burned anyone bad , but several had been singed and were suffering . A burning leaf had set 011ie Fenelon 's hair afire before he could slap it out , and he had a raw scalp . And Tom Freka 's big horse had a burn across his hip from a bullet that had come out of nowhere . His own clothes were still damp from the soaking , for most of them had gone in up to their necks . Their blanket-rolls were wet , and a lot of their grub had been soaked . Pierce Mowatt , his half-brother and the best cook among them , was contriving something at the fire . Several coffeepots were on the coals , and things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ! " Freka yelled suddenly . " I 'll break both his legs and show him what the feel of fire is ! " Jake Strawn rolled the tobacco in his jaws and spat . " You get a chance to kill him , you better not try no fancy touches . " " You think he 's really somethin ' , do n't you ? " Freka sneered . " Uh-huh . He 's the best I ever seen . . . unless it 's me , " Strawn was complacent . " He 's right handy , an ' you choose your weapon . Knife , pistol , or club , he 's rough an ' randy . " " I 'll kill him ! " Freka repeated . " Pa ? " It was Frank , and Mac Mowatt looked up . 143  | " I 'm takin ' a ride to Santa Fe . Maybe El Paso . I 'd be pleased not to ride alone . " There was a momentary silence , then Mac shifted his boots . " Do n't talk that way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got no liking for this dodging about in the brush , all on somebody 's say-so that there 's gold . " So much was what Frank thought and felt . When he continued , he was speaking partly to affect the others . " I want to see a woman . I want some lights and some fancy grub . Or at least some grub we do n't have to fix for ourselves . There 's stages down near the border . And there 's cattle can be stole across the border an ' sold this side . An ' vice versa . We 're a-wastin time here , Pa . " " There 's got to be a mint o ' gold , " Mac said . " Why , they was comin ' out of Mexico with an army after ' em ! What was they after ' em for ? Just those fool papers Clive was supposed to have ? " " Who told you about that army , Pa ? " Frank inquired mildly . " That 's just border talk , you know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't they spend it ? Why would a man bury gold in the ground ? Did we ever bury any of ours ? " " Why should we bury it ? " Pierce asked . " That 's what I 'm saying , " Frank said quietly . " Why should anybody bury gold ? If there 's a posse after ' em and they need to lighten their load , maybe . If they got so much they ca n't carry it , maybe . But if there was an army after Ben Mowatt and Clive Chantry , what happened to the army ? " Fenelon looked up . " Whad'ya mean ? " " They were after them , were n't they ? This was Spanish territory them days , was n't it ? So if they was after them , why did they stop short ? Mowatt got  | killed , and Clive settled down right here an ' stayed , so they would n't have had no trouble findin ' him . " " Aw , hell ! " Fenelon said . " We know an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Socorro , he knowed all about it . He said they was Mex soldiers , and he was on the border when they was chasing Mowatt an ' Chantry . " " Was n't any border , " Frank said quietly . " Not them days . I heard tell Charlie never even come into this country ' til just before the war . " He got out his pipe and loaded it . He did n't want to talk anymore . They were out-of-sorts and sore at the world . Let them stew about it . Treasure ! Lost mines ! How many stories had he heard ? Some of them made sense . Some of them had some basic logic behind them , but most of them would n't hold water . He got up and started for the river bank . He 'd taken no more than a step when he heard the rumble . He started to turn , saw what was happening and yelled , " Run ! Rockslide ! Run ! " They ran . They scattered . Somebody charged into Frank full-tilt and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to be missed by a boulder the size of a mule . It hit a rock above them and bounded over their heads . Men were falling , cursing . Somebody screamed . There was a roaring behind them , then a few scattered rocks falling down , a trickle of pebbles , and silence . And then the swearing began . " Help ! " a voice called . " I got a busted leg ! " Men came out of the creek , stamping the water from their legs , pausing to empty their boots . " Where 's the horses ? " Mac Mowatt yelled . There was more cursing . 145  | " Gone , god damnit ! " Pierce said . Their fire was out , buried under a deluge of rocks and gravel . Their coffeepots were spilled , smashed , or buried . Their food was under a heap of rocky debris from off the cliff . It had n't been a big slide , but big enough to frighten the horses , wipe out their camp , and ruin their supper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " did that have to happen ? " " Happen , hell ! " 011ie Fenelon shouted . " That did n't happen ! It was done ! Somebody had to start that rockslide ! " Mowatt swore , and Freka said again , " I 'll kill him , damnit . I 'll kill him ! " Jake Strawn gathered up what he could find of the camp gear . When Frank came over to help , Strawn said , " El Paso sounds better'n better . " Strawn found one dented but intact pot , and they found most of their gear and bedding , after some digging . One rifle had a broken stock , and the wooden stirrup on a saddle was broken . But that could be repaired , and the gun stock also , with time . When the coffee was ready they took turns , for they needed more than one pot . It was a slow , tiring supper they ate and finally , on ground a hundred yards from their original campsite , they bedded down . It was after midnight before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all were asleep . Even Mac , who 'd been doing some serious thinking . The moon rose later and finally shone into the canyon . Suddenly the perfect stillness of the mountain night was split wide open by the heavy explosion of a rifle shot , unnaturally loud in the quiet . Tom Freka came to his feet with a scream of pure 146  | fury , and as he lunged erect a bullet hit the ground within inches of his toes . He sprang back , tripping over Frank Mowatt to fall in a heap . Another shot followed , and then stillness . Bleary-eyed from weariness , only half-awake , the men stared around , and then from the cliff above them came a mocking voice , singing , " We 're tenting tonight on the old campgrounds , give us a song to cheer ? " Tom Freka emptied his rifle toward the sound high above . " Goodnight , boys ! " It was Owen Chantry 's voice . " Sleep late in the morning . " Wiley swore bitterly , and after a minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a long time before they could sleep . Pierce Mowatt came out of the darkness and walked down by the stream , lighting his pipe , half-expecting a shot . But no more shots were heard . The trouble was , Mac Mowatt reflected , now they would never know . Nobody would strike a match , try to make coffee , or settle down for a meal without wondering when the shots were going to come . There were two possible solutions : leave the country or track down Owen Chantry and kill him . He said as much to Freka . " There 's another , " Freka said . " I think he 's got a case on Marny . If'n we could get Marny back , he 'd come for her . " " No ! " Mowatt 's voice was flat and harsh . " Marny 's kin . Keep her out of this . " " It 's your funeral , " Freka said , but he was doing his own thinking . If he could get Marny , then he 'd have Marny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bait him right into a trap . . . a juicy trap . 147  | Jake Strawn  --  big , tough , and raw-boned , a gunhand in many a cattle war , a man who 'd done time in two prisons  --  looked across at Freka . Tom Freka might be a mystery to some , but he was an open book to Strawn . Jake turned on his side with disgust and closed his eyes . The trouble with being on the wrong side of the law was the kind of company you had to keep . Daylight came to the camp on Lost Canyon with a red glow on the rimrock . Owen Chantry , who had slept two hours , went down to the river and bathed his face in the cold water , cupping it in his hands to dash into his eyes . He stood up , shaking water from his fingers . The trouble with doing what he had done was that the other side could do it too . It was time to move . Kernohan was better and might be strong enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go too far . Chantry watched a squirrel run out on the rocks near the water , then turned back to the camp . He was tired , dog tired , and it was catching up with him . Yet he knew he could go for days . . . might have to go for days . " Ten , " he said aloud . " Ten , eleven , twelve ? " What had Clive been trying to say ? The other day he 'd again had a fleeting idea that had disappeared as quickly as it came . . . some haunting thought that had come to him . He walked back to the camp and sat down . Marny was up and combing her hair . The filtered sunlight caught the light in it , and Chantry watched . She was uncommonly graceful , her every move . " Nice morning , " he said quietly . " Where were you last night ? I was worried . "  | He chuckled softly , amused . " I went serenading . I wanted to sing those boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowing what he meant . He picked up the book of poetry and turned the pages under his thumb . Clive had read it a lot . " Locksley Hall " had been a favorite of his and Clive 's too . There was a copy of " Marmion " by Sir Walter Scott , tucked in the pages , written in Clive 's own hand . It gave him a sudden pang of loneliness . He would never see Clive again . Suddenly , he knew . Suddenly Owen believed he knew where Clive Chantry 's treasure was hidden . At least he had a clue . Even with the clue , it would take some searching to find . But at least he now knew how Clive was thinking . Clive Chantry had been a considerable scholar , yet he had taken his linguistic skills casually , learning several languages before he was fifteen , and acquiring others as the need developed or as his interests demanded . In several years of wandering , much of it in South and Central America as well as Mexico , he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a scholar , he was keenly aware of the demands of scholarship , and his wanderings had taken him into places , and brought him into contact with people , who were relatively unknown . There might actually be a treasure . Owen Chantry watched Marny brush her hair but , attractive as she was , his thoughts were far away . 149  | Mac Mowatt would not take the midnight attack on his camp lying down . He dare not , if he expected to lead his outfit . They would be angry , eager to retaliate . And this time they would come in for the kill with no nonsense about it . " We 've got to move , " Chantry said , suddenly . " Move to where ? " Doby said . He was sitting quiet with his thoughts . " All we 're gon na do is get out in the open where they can wipe us out . " Chantry glanced at the old man , who was leaning on his rifle , watching them with his bright-gray eyes . " You know this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " A couple . Figgered you 'd be wantin ' to go back to the cabin on the rampart . There 's places up there ? " " How about water ? " Doby protested . " I seen no water . " At least if he had , he did n't remember it . The old man chuckled . " You youngsters , you never look . Got no eyes ! Why , there 's a passel o ' water right near to the door ! Off there to the right , hid behind the brush . 01 ' Clive , he was no fool ! A man needs water , an ' he built hisself a dam . Across the gully to catch the runoff . Got a drain for her , too , an ' a rock to stop off the drain when need be , so ' s the water keeps fresh . " Rained there t' other night , so there 'll be water .. . maybe five hundred gallons . . . maybe twice that much . " " I do n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get out up there , an ' you 're caught in a trap . " " No need , son . Chantry , you 're an army man . Move out from the cabin , set up a perimeter defense . Give y'rself room to move in . Why , there 's a-places up there a good man with a rifle could stand off an army ! I can show ' y where . Now , if y ' really ? " " I do , " Chantry said bluntly . " Let 's go ! " 150  | Within a matter of minutes they were moving , with the old man to ride point , followed by Marny and Kernohan , then Doby , with Owen Chantry riding well back to cover their flight , if need should be . " Wrong time o ' day , " the old man grumbled . " Of a nighttime I could take y ' there easy as pie . This here way we got t ' keep under cover , got t ' ride careful , like . " We can hole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Just get us away from here ! " The old man spat , shifted his rifle in his hands , and then said . " Got just the place ! Take ' em awhile t ' find us there ! " " How far ? " " Four , five mile . ' Bout that . " He pointed with a long bony finger . " South . " He led off down canyon . Curiously , the canyon 's walls grew less steep , and the canyon itself flattened out into a series of meadows . The old man skirted a low hill , then led them up the slight bank and into the trees . Chantry rode behind , rifle in hand . He was worried . They had left the canyon almost too easily , and his every sense told him trouble was near , though the old man was wily . The way he had taken them was hidden from view , and there was a chance they 'd escaped observation . The day was hot and still . And it was quiet , altogether too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doby was leading the packhorses , including his own buckskin . How many were left in Mowatt 's crowd ? Several had been killed , although he could be certain of only a few . . . three , perhaps . And several injured . Chantry ducked his head under a low branch , glimpsed Doby ahead with the packhorses and at a 151  | " So I heard . Le 's go on an ' ride , Mr. Chantry . I 'll not hold you back . " He was silent for a few minutes , and Chantry sat on a slab fallen from the overhang and sipped his coffee . " That boy 's doin ' all right , ai n't he ? " asked Kernohan . " He sure is . He 's carrying his weight and more . You 've no need to worry about him . " " I reckon . ' Though a body does worry . Times are hard for a boy his age . No young folks , no dances , socials or such . Why , he ai n't seen a box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a beautiful country , " said Chantry . " There will be people along soon , lots of them . There 're a good many in the San Luis valley already , and just a few years ago a man named Baker led a party into the San Juans . We 're just the first . Doby will have plenty of company soon . " At moonrise , they moved off with Chantry leading . He started at a rapid trot and held it . The trails were narrow , but they were plain to see in the moonlight . The old man moved up beside Chantry . " You ride keerful , young feller . Them boys might be most anywheres about " From time to time Chantry drew up , listening , trying the air for smoke . He doubted if the renegades were so far east , but they could be . The night was cool and still , almost cold . The peaks were harsh against the blue black sky and bright stars . There was no sound but the creak of saddles and the fall of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The rifle felt good in his hands . The old man dropped back to spell Doby at leading the packhorses , and the boy rode forward to join Chantry .  | " Where you think they are ? " Doby asked , lowvoiced . Chantry shrugged . " No telling , Doby . " The fire had gone out . Mac Mowatt was hunched against a tree , chewing on a chunk of elk meat . He felt sour and old , and there was no pleasure in him . Frank was gone . Pulled out . He 'd never believed that Frank would leave him  --  although it was obvious he was discontented . Mac Mowatt was sore as an old grizzly with a bad tooth . He stared at 011ie Fenelon , who was rubbing his burned scalp , which was now beginning to peel . Then his eyes went to Pierce , at the fire . Jake Strawn had drawn away from the others and was slitting by himself . Strawn was something of a loner , anyway . And tonight Mowatt was especially remembering what Chantry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him close . How many of them could he trust ? Mowatt knew the answer . . . probably not one of them , unless it was his own kinfolk , and he was none too sure about them . The losses they had taken , the wounded men , the man with the broken leg . They 'd been out maneuvered by Chantry every time . It rankled . They 'd spent too much time in these hills with nothing to show for it . And despite all his arguments , he knew some of the men were beginning to doubt there was anything here . Frank was gone . Mac knew that some of them had set great store by Frank . He was solid . He was there , and you knew he was there . Strawn was just lingering on , and Tom Freka paid almost no attention to Mowatt 's orders anymore . 155  | They were a sorry bunch . . . a sorry bunch . He lifted the coffee cup to his lips , and at that very moment he heard the horse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cat . Mowatt dropped his cup and got up fast . Chantry had slowed his horse to jet the old man come abreast . Doby had turned in his saddle to look for his father . And the next thing they knew they were right in the middle of the Mowatt camp . The shock was complete on both sides . It was Freka who came to life first , leaping to his feet and grabbing for his gun . But Owen Chantry had quickly lunged his horse forward . The horse 's shoulder hit Freka as his gun came up , and he was knocked sprawling into Strawn , who was just rising off the ground . Wiley raised up , grabbing a rifle . Using his rifle in one hand like a pistol , Chantry thrust it at him and fired . Wiley gave a choking cry and fell backward , his arms and legs all spread out , his chest bloody . And then there was only a roar of sound , of guns and screams and yells , leaping men and charging horses . Mac Mowatt got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just in time to escape being run over by the packhorses . Then it was over . It had been a wild , crazy two minutes of gunfire and screams . Then the gunfire was scattered , and clothes were burning , the coffee was spilled , and Mowatt 's men were scrambling back around the burned out coals of their campfire . The riders were gone . Freka , on his feet , was still grabbing about for his gun , dropped from his hand . When he found it , he turned and ran for his horse .  | Mowatt swore and shouted orders . " Get your hosses an ' git ! " he yelled . " Get ' em , damn it ! Get ' em ! " . They followed his orders . Strawn got up and brushed off his clothes . The others , save Mac Mowatt and Pierce , who was looking at their last shattered coffeepot , were already gone . Mac Mowatt had started for his own horse , then hesitated . After a moment he walked over and picked up his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Let ' em go , Mac , " Strawn suggested . " They wo n't find anything . And if they do , they 'll wish they had n't . " " You think they did it a-purpose ? " Pierce asked . " Uh-uh , " Strawn said . " They come up on us by accident . Surprised them as much as us . " He nodded to indicate Wiley 's body . " You better have you a look . I figure he 's dead . Owen Chantry do n't miss very often . " Pierce crossed to the fallen man . " Dead , all right . Through the heart , looks like . " He turned to Mac . " Let 's get out of here . Next thing we know it 'll be one of us . " " Get out ? " Mowatt rumbled . " I 'll be damned if I will ! There 's gold up there , I tell you ! Gold ! " Jake Strawn glanced around . " And what if there is ? How far do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 'd murder you for what 's in your pocket , most of ' em . I say we get out and stay out . And then , after awhile , we come back nice and quiet like , with only a few of us . . . the ones who can be trusted . " Pierce nodded . " I like that . I really do . Catch ' em off guard , an ' by that time Chantry'Il have the gold . " " Will they leave for good ? " Mac Mowatt asked . 157  | " They will . . . chances are , except for Freka . He wants Marny . " " What ? " Mowatt 's head came up . " Tom Freka ? I 'd kill him first ! " " You ai n't noticed ? " Strawn asked . " Well , I have . And the man 's not normal . Not human . There 's something wrong with him . " " I 'll kill him , " Mac Mowatt muttered . " You may have to , " Strawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 18 The cabin on the rampart lay still and cool under the dawn light . The sentinel pines stood straight and dark , austere as nuns at prayer . The leaves of the aspens trembled , and the high peaks of distant mountains were crowned with the gold of sunrise . Their horses walked into the stillness , tired from the miles behind them , grateful for the scent of water and the end of their journey . Owen Chantry dismounted and reached up to help Marny down , just a second before Doby reached her . Doby scowled and dropped his hands as if to imply that he had not even intended to help . Then he walked to his father , helped him from the saddle , and half-carried him into the house . " Old man , " Chantry said , " do you want to explore out there ? Have a look around ? You 're probably the best scout among us . " " Maybe . Y'do pretty well your own self . Ai n't  | nothin ' to fear from this place right here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a powerful lot of noise gettin ' through all that brush . " When the gear was stripped from the horses , the packs carried inside , and a bed made for Kernohan , Owen Chantry took his rifle and went out along the rim . The shadows were pulling back from the vast expanse to the west , where hundreds of miles of land lay open to the eye . The land at the rim sloped off , then ended abruptly in a tremendous escarpment , a sheer wall of two hundred feet dropping away to talus slopes below . Yet the cliffs were not smooth , but were fluted and broken . Suddenly , near the place where the walls of two escarpments met , he saw a narrow gap between a boulder and a raised portion of the wall . He peered through . Here , hidden at the edge of the escarpment , was a secret place  --  a descent to the ground below , but an excellent firing position also . Several possible trails were in full view from here , and a man with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said aloud . " Or the old man . Somebody who 's good with a rifle . " Marny came up to meet him . " Can you see them ? " " They have n't found us yet . " " Have you found out where it is ? I mean , whatever it is that 's hidden ? " " I think I know how to find it now . " She looked out over the forest and meadows below . " It is beautiful . With all God 's bounty , why must there be so much trouble ? " " That is the hardest question of history , Marny , the question people have asked in every age , in every time . Many men want what other men have . Men are 159  | often greedy , jealous , and vindictive . Or they look across the fence at what they think is greener grass . They pursue will-o ' - the- wisp dreams , such as this treasure ' . " Chantry scanned the horizon . Men have died , months of time have been wasted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from someone else 's spoils . And the end is not yet in sight . " " What will happen ? " Marny looked up at him . " They will come after us . They have committed themselves to a course of action . If they gave up now , all their efforts would go for nothing . So they will not give up . " " When will they come ? " " I do n't know . But we must stop them . . . if we can . " I hope that Mac Mowatt does not come with them . I would n't want to see him shot . " " Nor I. " Bright now was the land below , bright with the early sun , with the clearness of the sky . It was a good land . Grazing land for the most part , but here and there a plain where something could grow well . A man could make a living here . And as mining increased  --  as it was bound to  --  he could sell beef cattle to the miners . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a handful of the soil . Good . . . very good . . . . Many trees and plants grew here , and others could also grow . Down there on the flat , still others could grow . There was more water there . A man might choose crops by studying what already grew in the soil , and choosing those crops which needed the same soil , water , and climate .  | He leaned on the rock and put his rifle beside him . His eyes again swept the vast green land that lay below . What a place Clive Chantry had chosen for his cabin ! The rampart ! There could not be a more beautiful view anywhere , nor one encompassing a wider lookout . He was tired . The warm sun baked his muscles and he slowly relaxed . " When this is over , Owen , where will you live ? " " Here . . . . If I 'm alive . Or down there , " he gestured below . Then he saw them . Four riders in a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near a canyon . They rode up out of the draw and came at a canter across a meadow , rode into the trees , then emerged again . He pointed . " Marny ? Look ! " She looked . They rode in a tight group , occasionally stringing out , then coming together again like figures in a square dance . " From here , " she said quietly , " they look beautiful ! " " Yes , " he agreed , watching them appear and disappear along the trail they followed . " How far away are they ? " He shrugged . " A mile and a half . Two miles . They 're slowing down now , and I think they 're looking at us . " " You mean they see us ? " " No . They could n't pick us out from here . . . I think they 're scanning the wall for a way up . " " We 'd better tell the others , " Marny said . " All right . " But he hesitated , his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others , you know , coming by some other route . " 161  | " Do you want Doby ? " " No , tell him to check on his father , then locate the old man and work with him . They will have to cover the trail from the spring side . This may be a long fight , and it may be over quickly . " The riders below were closer now . Chantry caught the gleam of light from a rifle barrel . He watched them , and there were few places their trail led that could not be seen from his vantage point . He tucked the rifle butt against his shoulder and lowered his cheek to the stock , sighting along the barrel , tracking them . They were too far away for a shot , but he was in no hurry . Nor had he any wish to waste his ammunition . Suddenly , he was anxious . The riders must know they were up here . The riders must surely know that they could be seen . Then why ... ? He turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door and saw Kernohan inside . He was sitting up in bed . " What 's happened ? What 's wrong ? " Kernohan asked him . Kernohan 's rifle was in a corner near the door , and Chantry caught it up with his left hand and threw it to the sick man . " We 've got trouble , " Chantry said . He ducked away from the door and started for the trees . Suddenly a shadow loomed in the trees . He saw a rifle come up and then he shot from the hip . The bullet hit a tree near the man 's face , scattering splinters and bark . Chantry worked the lever and fired again . The man 's gun banged but no bullet sound followed . Chantry saw the man clinging to a tree , one arm around it . The man was staring at him with wide , empty eyes , his lips working with words that would not come out , that would never come out .  | Owen Chantry ran past the dying man , catching up his rifle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good rifle . Suddenly he halted and went back to the man , now down on the ground , his shoulder and chest against the tree , his head hanging forward . Without ceremony or hesitation , Chantry unbuckled his gun belt and jerked it free . There were twenty loops in the man 's belt , all filled with .44S . They had timed it nicely . The four horsemen below must have waited under cover until the others had circled around to come up to the house . While Chantry was watching the riders below , the men near the house had simply closed in . Luckily , he had guessed their strategy in time . Or had he ? There must be others . Where were they ? Where was Marny ? Where were the old man and Doby ? No sounds , no shots . Was the man be had wounded or killed the only one near the house ? He did n't think so . Where were the others ? He crouched behind a thick ponderosa at a point where another had fallen against it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out from somewhere in front of him . " Come on out , Chantry ! Give yourself up ! We 've got the kid and we 've got Marny Fox ! " " Is Mac Mowatt with you ? " Chantry called back . A momentary silence . Then : " No , he ai n't . That ai n't got nothing to do with it . You come out or we 'll kill ' em both . " " I 'd like to hear you say that to Mac Mowatt , " he called back . " You come on out . Throw down your guns and come on out . " 163  | Chantry eased his position , seeking a place to move , giving a glance to the ground cover to see how much noise he would make in moving . He thought he had the threatening voice located . Where was the old man ? Did Mowatt 's gang even know about him ? " Come out , damn you , or we 'll start busting the kid 's fingers ! " " Who killed Clive ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I told you I wanted him . . . or them . . . hung . Have you done what I want ? " " Are you crazy ? We 're in command here ! " Are you now ? " How many were there ? Chantry was suddenly quite certain that there were no more than three , possibly two , and that if they had captured Doby and Marny , the boy and girl were not with these men . He moved swiftly , silently , twenty yards in the trees and knelt down . Where were Mowatt , Freka , and Strawn ? Chantry was poised for a move when he heard the sudden boom from a heavy rifle . There was a yell , then a volley of shots , then after a slight interval , the heavy boom again . Then swearing . He crept toward the noise , carrying both rifles . Suddenly , he dropped his own rifle and threw the other to his shoulder . Several men had broken out of the brush and were running diagonally across from him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and another turned swiftly and levered three quick shots at Chantry . Something struck him a wicked blow and he fell . A second shot spat bark from the tree where his head had been just a moment ago . Chantry fired again but the men were gone . 164  | He was on his knees , rising , when a man broke through the brush coming right straight at him . Chantry swung his rifle and caught him across the shins . The man 's mouth opened in a scream , and Chantry left the ground in a lunging dive that knocked the man to the ground . The man tried to get up , swinging his gun to bring it to bear , and Chantry , lacking purchase or room for a proper swing , thudded the butt of his rifle against the man 's chin . Chantry himself staggered and fell against a tree . The man , whoever he was , was out cold . Chantry threw the man 's rifle into the trees and jerked off his gun belt . His left leg hurt bad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give up his spare rifle . It was too awkward to carry . He leaned it against a tree , half-hidden by low-growing branches . Then he moved to another tree and limped into a thicker stand . Now he could see the corner of the cabin , some distance off through the forest . He had started toward it when his move was cut short . " All right , Chantry ! This is Strawn ! Do n't move ! " There was nothing else to do . Chantry stood perfectly still and they came up to him and took his gun . 19 A wrong move  --  a move of any kind , and he was dead . There was no nonsense about Strawn . He was not a vicious man , but he had killed and would kill again , and his shots were true . 165  | To move was to die , and Owen Chantry was not ready to die . " Looks like you win the hand , Jake , " he said mildly . " I was hoping you were n't around . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am , too ! " That would be 011ie Fenelon . Two more of the Mowatt men were coming up through the trees . " Hell ! " one of them exclaimed . " This ai n't no buffalo gun ! This here 's a Henry ! " " Well ? You heard it , did n't you ? Sure sounded like a buffalo gun ! Sounded like a big Sharps fifty ! I 'd a swore " Mac wants to see you , Owen , " Strawn said . " You just walk easy now and do n't make me kill you . " Chantry had no choice but to follow . When they came to Mowatt 's camp , a fire was going , and Mac Mowatt was waiting for them . " Well , Chantry , " Mowatt was sitting , his heavy forearms locked about his knees . " You 've given us some trouble . But now you 're goin ' to make it all worthwhile . " " Always glad to oblige , " Chantry said , seating himself on a rock , " what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to leave the country , you just take this trail along here ? " " Leave ? Who said anythin ' about leavin ' ? " Mowatt asked him . " Well , " Chantry said seriously , " it seems to me that if you want any of your men left , that 's what you should do . I figured Strawn here took me because you needed a guide through the mountains , and there 's nothing I 'd rather do . " " Damn you , Chantry , " Mowatt said . " Go to hell . All we want from you is treasure . Show us where it is and we 'll let you go free . "  | Chantry smiled . " Now , Mac . Let 's be honest . You 'd never turn me loose . You know I 'd only get another gun Tom Freka had joined them . " Not without hands , you would n't . What if we took off your hands , Chantry ? You got two hands now , but I got a bowie , an ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That sounds just like you , Freka , " Chantry replied quietly . " You 'd cut off my hands because you know I can draw faster and shoot straighter than you . You 're scared , Freka . You 're just plain scared . " " Am I ? " Freka took a big burning stick from the fire . " You also got two eyes . How would you like to try for one ? " " Put it down , Freka , " Mowatt said . " I 'll kill a man , but I 'll be damned if I 'll torture one . " " Then how do you expect us to find that treasure ? " Freka asked . " You think he 'll just up an ' tell us ? " " Why not , Freka ? " Chantry said . " Mowatt 's a gentleman . And Strawn here 's a man of his word . I 'd trust either one of them . " He stretched his stiff leg out before him . " Mowatt , do you have Marny and the boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catched ' em unexpected like . Yeah , I got ' em all . Back yonder . " Mowatt pointed back over his shoulder . " Turn them loose . Let them get out of here with their horses and Doby 's father , and I 'll take you to whatever it is , if I can . " " You think we gon na believe that ? " Freka demanded . " I believe him , Freka , " Strawn said . Mowatt shifted his position and took out his pipe . " Figure it this way , Chantry . We got you . We got 167  | them . The boy 's old man is mighty sick hurt . We ai n't got to argue with nobody , an ' we ai n't got to deal with nobody . Either you tell us what we want , or we let that man die . We might even shoot Doby . " Mowatt drew on his pipe to test the stem , then began to tamp tobacco . " We might even kill you . " " You might . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chantry . " Not if you know what 's good for Marny . " " You do n't seem to get the idea , " Mowatt said . " You ai n't in no position to bargain , Chantry . You got no place to stand . Just get us that treasure an ' you 'll have no more trouble . " " " Release my friends , " Chantry said quietly , " then hang the man who killed Clive , and I 'll show you the treasure . " " You goin ' to listen to that talk ? " Freka snorted . " Well , I do n't know about that , " Pierce Mowatt said . " It might be a right good deal . " " Might be at that , " Jake Strawn said . " We got nothing against the boy , or his pa either . " " Chantry 's a troublemaker , " Freka said angrily . " Ca n't you see ? He 's tryin ' to get us fightin ' amongst ourselves . " " Seems to me , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be hung , just for the good of his friends . " He was smiling easily , but his mind was working swiftly . " Where 's the treasure , Chantry ? " Mowatt asked bluntly . " You boys have kept me so busy I have n't had time to look . " Chantry shrugged . They had his gun , and they had his rifle , but somewhere not half a mile away the captured rifle still leaned against a tree .  | " Chantry , " Mowatt spoke slowly and carefully , " I want you to get this straight . You 've given us a sight of trouble , an ' we ai n't goin ' to put up with it . You got you one more chance . Find whatever it was Clive Chantry brought out of Mexico . If you do n't , I 'll not leave you to the boys . I 'll shoot you myself . " " Looks like I do n't have much choice , " Chantry said . " But all I 've got is a clue . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know what the clue is , " Chantry admitted , " but I do n't know how to read it . Like it or not , I 'm going to need time . " When Clive was murdered , he was n't quite dead when he was left behind . So he left me something to work on . " " What could he leave if he was dyin ' ? " It was Freka again . " He wrote something on the door step . He wrote the word ten . " They stared at him . " Ten ? What 's that mean ? " Freka demanded . " Ten what ? " " My thought exactly , gentlemen , " Chantry said . " Ten what ? Then I wondered , if it was ten feet , ten miles , ten inches , then why did n't he write the numeral ? Why the word ten ? " " Do n't make no sense , " 011ie Fenelon muttered . It surely do n't . " " " You figgered it out yet ? " Mowatt asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write Tennyson . " Chantry said . " Tennyson ? What 's that ? " Pierce demanded . " It ai n't what , " Mowatt said . " It 's who . It 's a man 's name . 169  | " Name of who ? " 011ie asked . " I never heard such a name . " " It 's a writer , " Mowatt said . He glared around at the others . " If you would read once in awhile you 'd know somethin ' . Tennyson is a writer . " He glanced at Chantry . " English ai n't he ? " " English . . . and a poet . A very good poet " " Poet ? " 011ie was shocked . " What would a man write a poet 's name for when he was dyin ' ? " " I like his poetry , " Chantry said quietly . " And so did Clive . Whatever he 'd hidden he did n't wish anyone to find it but me . So he was trying to conceal it in such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hell ! " Freka spat . " If one man can find it , another man can too . " " You 've tried , I think , " Chantry said . " But what have you found ? You 're welcome to go on trying . There 's room enough for every one to look . Be my guest . " " If you know something sure , stop talkin ' so much an ' tell us , " Mowatt said . " Was it somethin ' in one o ' them books he left ? " " Of course . " Chantry got to his feet and stretched . Three guns were on him , and the men who held those guns were ready to kill him . But not quite yet . They wanted to know what he knew . " We both liked Tennyson , " Chantry said . " Certain of Tennyson 's poems we both liked very much , so Clive naturally thought of something he knew I would think of also . The secret to the hiding place is hidden in one of Tennyson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd a thought of that ? " Fenelon was disgusted . But suddenly his mood changed . " I do n't believe it ! I do n't believe one cottonpickin ' word . You made the whole thing up ! " 170  | " Maybe some of it , " Strawn said , " but I seen that ten . Never paid it no mind . " Mac Mowatt was watching Chantry with careful eyes . " All right , what next ? " he asked finally . " I 'll need a copy of Tennyson , " Chantry said . " You sure ? " Mowatt stared at him , eyes hard . " Do n't you remember ? Did n't you learn it by heart ? " " No , " said Chantry , " I did n't . I do n't even know which poem it 's in . I 'll need the book , and I 'll need some time to study it at the cabin . " " We ai n't got no time to waste , " said Freka . " We 'll all go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Slim . Just so 's the rest of us stay together . Would n't want nothin ' to go wrong now . " Under his breath , Chantry swore . His mouth was dry , the taste bitter . This was his last chance . 20 " You 've not gon na need us all , " Freka said , " I 'll just stay here with Whitey and Slim and the prisoners . " You 'll come with us , " Mowatt said sternly . Tom Freka got to his feet slowly and he spat into the fire . " Whitey can stay , " he said , " but I 'll stay , too . " Owen Chantry felt his muscles slowly relax , yet all his senses were alert . This might be a showdown , and if " All right , Tom , " Mowatt was suddenly easy . " Maybe you 're just wore out . You set by while the rest of us pick up that gold . You just set by . " He let 171  | his eyes shift to Whitey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' you responsible for the people I 'm leavin ' . That goes for all of ' em . They 're not to be hurt , y'understand ? " Whitey nodded . " I hear you , Mowatt . They wo n't be . " Mowatt led the men off . When they were out of earshot of the camp , Pierce suggested , " Maybe I should go back ? " " They 'll be all right , " Mowatt said . " I would n't leave any woman where Freka is , " Chantry said . " Ai n't none of your damn business , Chantry , " Mowatt told him roughly . " Just lead us to that treasure now . " They walked the distance to the cabin . Chantry stopped in the clearing just shy of the cabin . A gun prodded his back . " What y ' stoppin ' for ? " Pierce demanded . Chantry did n't answer . " All right , get goin ' , " Mowatt said . Chantry walked forward , and seeing the door partially open , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inward . The room was empty , the bed was made . A few coals were gleaming in the fireplace . A blackened pot on the hearth steamed slowly . Chantry glanced quickly around . He saw no gun , nothing he could use for a weapon . He felt like he 'd been struck in the belly . He had hoped . . . he scarcely knew any longer what he had hoped . Mowatt pushed him hard from behind , and he staggered . " Damnit , get in there ! " Mowatt shoved in after him , glaring around . The books were on the table where he 'd put them .  | Chantry glanced out of the north window . Like the south window , it was small , almost like a porthole , though somewhat larger . It was rounded at the top . " Now look at them books ! " Mowatt said . " And you better find somethin ' quick ! " Mowatt took up the books one by one and riffled their pages . At one point a torn scrap of paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poem , " Ulysses . " Mowatt read the poem slowly , his lips moving , occasionally scowling over some word or meaning . " Hell , " he said , at last , " there ai n't nothing there ! " Only there was . He offered Chantry the book . Chantry made a show of turning the pages as if searching for a clue . 011ie Fenelon and Pierce Mowatt went outside , and he could hear them muttering over " Stuff an ' nonsense . " Chantry knew that " Ulysses " had been a special favorite of Clive 's . They had quoted it to each other in letters and written of certain passages in it . One passage that Chantry especially remembered began : " Yet all experience is an arch wherethro'u/ Gleams that untravell 'd world whose margin fades/ For ever and for ever when I move . " Reading quickly from first one poem and then another Chantry paced the floor . Pausing in his pacing , he looked out of the north window . Only trees in a dense stand beyond an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet the top of the window could be called an arch . He went back to turning the pages . Chantry sat down on the edge of the bed . " Damn it , " he muttered , with a great show of irritation , " it 's got to be here . " " It better be , " Mowatt said . 172  | Again Chantry paced the floor . This time he stopped in the middle of the room , reading a couple of lines from " Locksley Hall " aloud as though searching for something in them . Then he looked out through the south window . The sky was a brilliant blue . The sun shone brightly . A big granite rock was visible above the green of the grass . Chantry had started to turn away when something flashed across his vision . . . a faint gleam . He took his eyes from the window and slowly turned a page . " What was you lookin ' at then ? " Mowatt demanded . " I was just thinking , " Chantry replied . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put myself in his shoes and try to think like him . I may seem to be daydreaming , but I 'm not . " Mac Mowatt hitched around in his chair . " Your funeral , " he said shortly . " But I 'm gettin ' mighty impatient . And so are the boys . " " You have n't yet hung the killer of my brother , " Chantry said . " And I gave your men two weeks . " " Mowatt came off his chair with a lunge and backhanded Chantry across the mouth . He staggered , falling against the wall . Instantly , the men outside were in the doorway . Mowatt waved a hand . " It 's all right . He just gave me some lip . You boys relax . I can handle this . " Mowatt sat down again and Chantry picked up the fallen book . He tasted blood , and his lip was swelling where it had smashed against his teeth . " You keep a still tongue now , " said Mowatt . " I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the window . There , by the big granite rock where the secret way went down the mountain , there was a gleam . . . a bit of 174  | mica in the rock reflecting light . Chantry turned his eyes away and knew what he intended to do . It was a long , long chance to take , and it meant some closeup shooting , and a chance that he 'd be killed . He smiled . " What you smilin ' at ? " Mowatt demanded . Chantry continued to smile . " I was just thinking of your faces when I find it , " he said , " because I know it is n't what you think . You 've been a fool , Mowatt , leading your men on a wild-goose chase , getting several of them killed , and several hurt . And all for nothing . " Chantry wanted him close . He wanted him to hit again . He had to get him close . " I was smiling , too , " he added , " to think how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one thing we know about life is that we never get out alive , so why not live like a proud man ? Mowatt , you 're a yellow-bellied coward to hit an unarmed man . You are no gentleman , not even a shadow of one . You 're leading a murdering , cowardly band of renegades , and not one of them would stand up to a man in a fair fight . " And you , Mac Mowatt , supposed to be a fearless leader . I heard you back up for Freka . . . afraid to face him down . You 're nothing , Mowatt , nothing at all . You have n't the guts of a mouse . " Chantry was ready , poised for attack , but it did n't come . Mac Mowatt leaned back in his chair and grinned at him , his eyes cold and crafty . " You talk a lot , Chantry , " he said , " but you ai n't got what it takes . I know just what you 're thinkin ' . Like I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my gun , an ' then you 'll shoot it out . Well , it ai n't a-gonna work .
