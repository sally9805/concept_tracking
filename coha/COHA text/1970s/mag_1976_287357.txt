What was Howard Hughes ' legal residence ? Was he mentally competent ? Did he leave a will ? Who are the rightful heirs to his estimated $2 billion estate ? Last week , seven months after Hughes died of kidney failure aboard a Texas-bound private airplane , none of those questions had been answered ; Howard Hughes was generating as much mystery from the grave as he had in life . In the most bizarre quest for information yet , a neuropathologist will soon examine a portion of Hughes ' brain that has been pickled and preserved in a jar on a shelf in Houston 's Methodist Hospital . His mission : to look for evidence of disease or damage that could have impaired Hughes ' judgment ; such a finding would throw into question anything that Hughes signed or said during his later years . <P> The legal battle now involves at least 200 lawyers , who are poring through records in half a dozen states to find clues as to what Hughes ' intentions for his empire were . So complex has the case become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One enterprising attorney , Taylor Moore of Houston , is issuing a twelve-page newsletter to enable other lawyers to keep abreast of developments . Price : $200 a month . So many alleged wills have turned up that a Nevada promoter bound them together in a soft-cover book that sells for $5 . <P> Was Hughes sane or not ? This may never be known for certain , but old stories keep cropping up . In 1972 , Robert Maheu , a top Hughes administrator who had been fired , told the Securities and Exchange Commission that Frank William Gay , the ranking Hughes insider , had approached him in the late 1960s to discuss the possibility of having Hughes declared mentally incompetent . It was precisely the fear that a judge might question his mental competence that caused Hughes to go to any length , even risking his fortune , to avoid appearing in court . <P> For now , the most important question is which state Hughes regarded as his legal residence , Texas or Nevada . The answer is crucial to the future of Summa Corp. , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It stands to pay $300 million in Texas taxes unless it can be proved that Hughes did not reside in Texas . Summa lawyers , together with Hughes ' legitimate heirs , argue that before leaving the U.S. , Hughes lived for several years in Nevada , where there are no estate taxes . They contend that he listed so many addresses outside Nevada that none of them apply . Thus Nevada , with its large Hughes holdings ( hotels , casinos , 30,000 acres of undeveloped land ) , should be considered his residence , and Summa should not be required to pay taxes . <P> Texas officials disagree . Led by Attorney General John Hill , Texas lawyers argue that Hughes always intended to return to the state of his birth . They cite Hughes tax returns listing Houston addresses , plus Hughes ' death certificate , which gives Houston as his home . Hill contends that mental incompetence and isolation prevented Hughes from determining his final resting place . Therefore , Hill argues , residency should revert to his Houston birthplace .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
