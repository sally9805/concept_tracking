txt Army officers , the King bought at least a temporary truce . He also won freedom for about 70 United States , British , West German , and other hostages , including this reporter . Ten hours after the King 's final and pathetic radio appeal for peace , announcing the demands were met , we were free . During our three-day captivity in Amman 's two biggest hotels , our PFLP captors had placed dynamite and Claymore mines , threatening to blow up the hotels and ourselves if their demands were not fulfilled ? most especially , if the Jordan Army did not stop shelling the Front 's stronghold in the Wandat refugee camp near Amman . The second most crucial demand met was dismissal of King Hussein 's uncle , Maj. Gen. Nasser Ben Jamil , the Army commander in chief , and the armored forces commander , Maj. Gen. Zaied ben Shaker . What serves our revolution . . " We were fully determined , " George Habbash , the Front 's leader , told us after apologizing for the personal inconvenience , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we saw that they were determined to smash us with their tanks , artillery , and airplanes . " He told us , " You in your countries can not think like we Palestinians . We were driven from our homes like sheep 23 years ago and left in refugee camps , in inhuman conditions . What serves our revolution , what helps our revolution , is right , and very honorable . " When I asked Mr. Habbash if all the Front 's demands had been met , he answered , " Yes , all of them . " Besides the cease-fire and dismissals , these included release of all guerrilla prisoners and dissolution of the smaller guerrilla groups started by the palace , including the Army Seiqa ( Thunderbolt ) special forces units .

The Front 's fighting men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in complete physical control of all central Amman . The Army and King Hussein 's Bedouin guard controlled only the royal palace , on its huge fortified hill , and the summits of two of the seven hills ringing Amman . Army split in two " The Jordan Army is now split into two factions , " one of the Popular Front 's political ' commissars contended . " Half or more refused to obey palace orders to march south and enter . " They would not leave the front with Israel uncovered in order to crush us here . What is more , the Iraqi Army was with us . Both the Iraqis and the Syrians would have sent us more help , if we had needed it . " Virtually no one here believes the June 12 cease-fire will be the last , The Popular Front has felt its full strength ? it is not likely to avoid a new clash if the slightest friction provokes one . In Palestinian eyes . Mr. Habbash has emerged as a rival of Yasir Arafat , leader of the larger and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are part of the unified central committee , and Arafat is chairman , " acknowledged one Front leader , " we are free to act as we like . " " From now on , " added Mr. Habbash , " we want your Western governments to know that whatever the Front says , it means . And whatever it says it will do . it will do . "
