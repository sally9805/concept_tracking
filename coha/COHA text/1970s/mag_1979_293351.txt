The Shah ' s new memoirs feature bitter accusations <P> While he was in exile in Mexico last summer , the Shah of Iran produced a 280-page book describing the events that led to his overthrow . He was and is defiant in his insistence that events-and the U.S.-conspired against him . He was deposed , he feels , for doing the right thing . Last week , with the Shah sequestered in a Texas military hospital , his Reply to History* began appearing in the London weekly magazine Now ! <P> The Shah writes that he was astonished when he learned last January that U.S. Air Force General Robert Huyser , then Deputy Commander in Chief of American forces in Europe , had been in Tehran for several days . " General Huyser 's movements were normally laid down in advance . But this time nothing ... I questioned my generals . They , too , knew nothing . What , then , was this American general doing in Iran ? " <P> The Shah believes that Huyser 's mission was to " neutralize the Iranian army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. Ambassador William Sullivan , the Shah went into exile . " General Huyser remained in Iran for several days after my departure . Having arranged for the generals to abandon Dr. Shahpour Bakhtiar , head of the coalition government formed to see the country through its hour of crisis , all that remained for the fulfillment of his mission was the decapitation of Iran 's army . <P> " He was quickly to be satisfied . One by one they were executed ... Before the parody of a trial which preceded his execution , General Amir Hussein Rabii , commander in chief of the Iranian air force , was questioned about the role played by General Huyser . He replied to his judges : ' General Huyser threw the emperor out of the country like a dead mouse . ' " <P> The Shah claims that he was the victim of the progress he made in Iran . " When I began a shock program which would enable Iran to make up in 25 years the backwardness of centuries , I realized that success would be possible only by mobilizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mobilized , it has to be driven , and , while it sets to work , defended against those who would hinder the process . To leave saboteurs to operate in freedom would certainly not have permitted realization of this program . " <P> The Shah sees his failure as political . Every relaxation of controls was interpreted by his enemies as a sign of weakness . " There was a strange alliance between certain Tehran merchants , a feudal pseudo-theocracy and parties of the extreme left with the backing of a religious fanaticism foreign to the principles of Islam and Iranian traditions . " <P> In developing a modern political system , writes the Shah , his father " removed from the clergy part of the privileges they had previously enjoyed . Consequently , one section of the Shi'ite clergy responded by branding all temporal power as necessarily a form of usurpation . " But the Shah insists that he dealt relatively mildly with his opponents : " I am told today that I should have applied martial law more forcefully . This would have cost my country less dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sovereign can not save his throne by spilling the blood of his fellow countrymen . "
