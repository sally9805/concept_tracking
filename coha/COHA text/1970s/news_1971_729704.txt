txt A lot of people think that putting prayers back in schools would help curb crime , drugs , and moral decay . The House will vote next month on whether to initiate a constitutional amendment to restore school prayers , thrown out by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1962 and ' 63 . A group of 38 national religious leaders opposes the move . On the other hand , devout and ardent supporters are lobbying hard and believe they have got around the Supreme Court 's objection by limiting the exercise to " nondenominational " prayer . This would be permitted ' in any public building . There are many paradoxes . The House , which will decide on the matter , begins every session with formal prayer , and so does the Senate . " If Congress can do it , why not schools ? " advocates ask . At the same time , the proposal that is offered in the name of religion is opposed by spokesmen of organized religious groups . Again , the move intended to extend individual rights will , if passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bill of Rights . Major paradox The biggest paradox of all , perhaps , is the concept of " nondenominational " prayer . " I do n't think you can arrive at such a prayer , " says Joseph B. Robinson , general counsel for the American Jewish Congress , an opponent // *Can school prayer be nonsectarian ? // On the other hand , the Rev. Robert G. Howes , associate professor at Catholic University of America and national coordinator of Citizens for Public Prayer , says a poll earlier this year by Opinion Research of Princeton , N.J. , indicates 80 percent of the nation favors putting prayers back in schools . The emotional issue would almost certainly loose a spate of litigation , and Emanuel Celler , chairman of the House Judiciary Committee , has blocked the proposed constitutional amendment for eight years . His committee held extensive hearings in 1963 . A clear majority of the House favors bringing the matter to vote . A discharge petition , which requires a House majority , now orders consideration on Nov. 8 . A constitutional amendment requires a two-thirds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state legislatures . Congressmen besieged - It is believed there will be a concerted drive by some churches against the prayer amendment before the vote . Members of the House , meanwhile , are being besieged in favor of it from constituents . The First Amendment states : " Congress r shall make no laws respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof .. . . " The Supreme Court 's decision , written by former Associate Justice Tom C. Clark , said , " The place of religion in our society is an exalted one . " But it added that " we have come to recognize through bitter experience that it is not within the power of government to invade that citadel . . . . In the relation between man and religion , the state iffirmly committed to a position of neutrality . " School prayers , it was found , generally followed the direction of the dominant religion of the neighborhood . Should schools supported by public money , it was asked , encourage prayers that might be inappropriate to various faiths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they impose a pressure toward conformity and a kind of coercion . " ' What harm can it do ? ' Sponsors , on the other hand , ask , " What harm can it do ? " They hope it will help bring reaction against what they feel is moral decay . Thus the issue is joined . According to the spokesman of the American Civil Liberties Union , which opposes the amendment , " practically every major religious group opposes school prayer efforts because they know that any means of mixing government and religion is dangerous . " The 38 church leaders , including elements of Baptists , Methodists , Episcopalians , Lutherans , Presbyterians , Churches of Christ , Unitarian Universalists , Mennonites , and Jewish groups argue that the amendment will " introduce divisiveness " in national life . The amendment , they note , does not define a nondenominational prayer . Some members of the House are uncomfortable at having to vote on the matter . Letters are increasing and often show strong emotion .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
