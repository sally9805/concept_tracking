 | Now GIANT GRINDERS Gobble Our Waste Problem ! At 3:17 p.m . Ted Boxwell looked up from the control panel and shouted , " Hang on . This may shake us . " That 's when I learned that grinding up garbage can be dangerous . I 'd gone to Milford , Conn. , to see how one of the nation 's first monster waste-reduction factories works . When this city became desperate about drowning in trash not long ago , it ordered a machine tough enough to chew up the entire town piece by piece ? and spit it out like chopped hamburger meat . Earlier I had watched a mixture of trash and garbage 1 into a dark , cave-like pit three stories deep in the th . There , Brute 1 ? a steel-stomached 70-ton beast , roughly the shape of a space capsule ? ground it all to : - with a roar . I heard three iron bed frames and two auto fenders 1 into that cave . From the Brute 's massive jaws came sound like someone munching peanut brittle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ders into smaller pieces for the grinding teeth below . Omnivorous . There are one or two junkyard " shredrs " in the U.S. and a few hammer-mill crushers in hicago and elsewhere . But this is a grinder-type giant at can chew up everything and not choke on plastics , nce wire , or sloppy chemicals . I watched tons of Iky garbage and trash ground down to a little Ile of " mix " one-fifth the original size . The garbage comes out in the mix so full of iron , ass , wood , and other inedibles that not even rats or a gulls can eat it . Rats trying to feed off Milford 's ew " high-compaction " dump are starving . Normally , the 1000-hp electric cruncher hums like ' GARBAGE TRUCK UNLOADS INTO DITCH clockwork . So does its stand-in , Brute 2 . Their 34 , - 000-pound vertical rotors ( which do the grinding ) are so finely balanced they can be turned by hand ? it takes 10 minutes for them to stop after the current is cut off . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , something indigestible does get in . Then an impressive event , called " ballistic reject , " occurs . Inside the machine , up top in the round feed dome , that two-ton steel " bat " ? whirling around six times a second -- smashes into something impossibly solid , like an engine flywheel . The bat swats it like a giant-size fly ball and it hurtles up out of the monster in one lethal burp . If you 're standing above the pit , on the control bridge , you duck . It gags . Bad as a ballistic reject seems , it 's worse when an impossibly solid hunk of trash does n't come flying out . In the 18 months since Brute 1 and its mate were installed , it had gagged on something only four times . I just happened to be there for number five . My visit had begun on the 200-foot-long concrete floor at ground level , where cars driven by Milford residents backed toward a concrete-lined ditch 12 feet wide by eight feet deep , with a conveyor belt for a bottom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left a pile of broken tables and chairs , thousands of bottles , crates , TV sets , machine-shop stampings , toys , spoiled tomatoes ? all the hour-to-hour offal of a city . Two city trucks rushed in , dumped garbage , rushed out again . A Bobcat payloader bulldozed everything into the canal after plant workers pulled out the jawbreakers ? an automobile transmission and a truck 's @#  | driveshaft . The river of junk kept flowing toward the Brute 's mouth on the rubber conveyor belt , now deeply buried . Ted shouted something and pointed upward . High under the three-story ceiling hangs a master control bridge . We climbed steel stairs to a many-windowed room aglow with lighted switch panels . No one was working up there at the time . The man operating the conveyor belt was below on a sort of " combat control " bridge that crosses the ditch . " We have override controls down there where the operator 's closer to the action , " Ted explained . We climbed down for a closer look too . Oddly , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through steel gratings in the middle of the control-bridge floor was a dark hellhole where all the noise was coming from . Peering down in we saw two shadowy machines standing two stories tall . Each looked like an armorplated monster in floodlights that shone on them from one side of the pit . It might have been a ship 's engine room . Looking for trouble . We moved toward the operator , who was peering over the edge of the bridge at the river of stuff flowing into Brute 1 below . " We try never to take our eyes off the canal , " Ted said . " Even guns and knives have been seen in it . And always in the back of our minds , is the idea that some day we may see a body ... " All this time , in the pit under us , the Brute was chewing up a wrought-iron fence , spoiled fruit , bundles of paper . I watched 30 feet of galvanized iron duct go in . Now and then the Brute grunted and we knew that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Within the Brute we heard its bat whirling hard . But this was only the beginning torture for everything that went into it . Once creamed by the bat , the broken stuff fell to the real tigers : five revolving double rows of terrible teeth . These are the ring grinders and they look like double cogwheels four inches thick . To give flexibility , each wheel floats ? it has an oversize center bearing which can move on an undersize spindle with a wobbly motion , as needed . There are 60 such grinders and each has 24 teeth : 1440 teeth in all . As if this is n't enough , there 's another spin-bat at the bottom . This 50-pound sweeper plate crams the " mix " down through a thick steel choke ring collar , a kind of adjustable screen . Anything that 's still too big finally gets creamed down to size : Nothing bigger than two inches gets through . Big bite . Boxwell grabbed my arm and pointed . Tossing toward us on the flowing river of trash came somebody 's big white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it sailed under our bridge , teetered , and fell in . There was a heavier growl . For a second the ammeter on the control panel , flickering between 200 and 400 , jumped to 500 . The bridge shook slightly . Then the Brute was humming again . " For safety , the whole thing is set to trigger at 569 amps , " Boxwell said . " If she ever hits 569 and hangs there for 20 seconds , then she shuts everything down automatically . " I was hoping to see the pieces of fridge come out . We hurried down ladders and 30 feet below were in a room 40 feet square . For a few seconds we heard the big box rumbling around inside , nibbled by those 1440 teeth . We never saw identifiable pieces spill out the bottom grate , but it was there somewhere in the final mix . The mix discharge falls on a fast belt . This carries it 60 feet to the ceiling of the Stage 2 , or " compaction " building . " Let 's go up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ POPULAR SCIENCE This control booth , high above the dust and din , provec practical ? the operator was too far from the battle . So put remote switches on a " combat bridge " over the grinc Here are a grinder 's guts ! a breaker bar that smashes the trash , pairs of gear-like teeth that grind it against a grooved liner , and a choke ring that squeezes pieces smaller . We followed the moving belt , climbing a steep catwalk beside it . At last we found ourselves looking straight down at loading docks where two truck trailers stood waiting . The mix with the pulverized fridge in it tumbled into one trailer . As we watched , a rooftop hydraulic ram moved on the other trailer and the top slid open . Now the mix started falling into this one instead . Now and then the trailer jumped and shuddered  | violently . " That 's the internal ram working , " Ted explained . Through the open roof we watched the slow rust of the bigger ( 40-foot ) ram . Its eight telescoping sections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall of the trailer . " Wo n't the trailer burst ? " I asked Ted . " Steel-reinforced , " he said . Eight times the ram pushed and the trailer jumped . On the ninth jump it as packed almost explosively tight . When this trailer shoved out ( right ) it makes a pile the size of the one above . The bulldozer at extreme right spreads the pile of mix and covers it with a thin layer of dirt , creating a landfill . was full , I jumped into the Ford 9000 twin-screw tractor with driver Pete Alfano and rode it out into the wasteland . Half a mile from the plant the driver started the ram again . The trailer 's rear doors flew open . Now our high-compact load ? 65 cubic yards of mix weighing 40,000 pounds ? was squeezed out the back . In one load we had disposed of enough garbage and trash to fill 10 ordinary sanitation trucks . @#  | Back at the plant , I returned to the " combat bridge , " little knowing the trouble that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Does n't stuff get in here that should n't ? " I asked . Ted nodded . " Sometimes we stop the belt in time . But sometimes we do n't . Like the time we had a shaving-cream explosion . Hazardous materials are n't allowed , but one day a company truck dumped a lot of hot-lather shave cream in aerosol cans . Ordinary aerosol cans wo n't explode , but gas from a bunch of these hot-lather ones collected in No. 1 and let go with a bang that blew heaters and lights off the ceiling . " We were interrupted by a blast that sounded like a mountain howitzer . Ted 's hand jumped to the reverse-flow button . A yellow monitor light flashed to blue . " Ballistic reject coming , " he called . With another roar , a steel object ? cannonball size ? flew up from below and landed on the belt , smoking hot . " Probably a truck crankshaft , " Ted said . Someone wearing gloves jumped down on the belt and threw the ball of steel up onto the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The light glowed yellow again . The big trouble came soon after that . Suddenly the whole bridge shook violently . When a 70-ton grinder gets the shakes you know it . " Hang on , " Ted shouted . " I think this is going to get noisy . " Ailing Brute . Something hidden deep in garbage had sneaked into Brute 1 . It must have been huge , because a terrible banging began when it tangled with that two-ton bat . Ted raised an arm to warn the Bobcat operator away . Then once more he put the belt into reverse . He was trying to encourage ballistic reject by clearing the chute . We waited tensely . But nothing happened . No burp came . And this is bad . The sound from inside the machine was like pianos tumbling around . ( A heavy object , if not ejected , could explode through those steel walls ; it happened once to No. 2 . ) Now Brute 1 seemed in convulsions as the object inside banged around . " It 's probably bending around the bat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's main shaft ? Something had to be done fast . Ted decided to move the belt ahead a little at a time . By feeding in slugs of trash he hoped to push the obstruction through . But the trash did n't help . He picked up two old @# @# tires from a pile dumped nearh purpose and dropped them onto belt . " These may cushion it . " said . Next he valved in water gallons a minute , to cool the chine 's hot stomach . Shut-down . But the Brute roaring . I saw the ammeter flicker : 400 ? 500 ? 550 . She triggers constant 569 , Ted had warned . All at once the noise beca storm . There were three loud " b like thunder . A red light flashed a wild surge the ammeter swung to 600 , then to a red-hot 800. jumped right off the scale . An a bell , triggered up in the master trol room , sounded . A horn h There was a final big bang , suddenly everything stopped . power was off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in convulsions was puffing like a steam locomotive going up Pike 's Peak as it began 10-minute shuddering spin-down strong smell of hot metal hung the air . Ted valved in more water First aid . It was quitting ti but no one left . Four men descended with Boxwell deep into the dark Heavy wrenches unbolted a s steel inspection door . The maintanance man chinned himself into hot capsule , going feet first . Some , handed him a drop light . T warned : " Look first to see what bar . above you , Russ . " When the two men had been insi for four minutes we heard pounding Then , slowly , four asbestos gloves pushed out a piece of steel . It v. incredibly tortured . It had battered into a tight beach ba punched and rolled up tight . It v. so scarred it glittered like a diamonds What had sneaked into No. 1 , th discovered , was a huge industry hot-water tank that must have b close to 10 feet tall . This beach bal of metal had been part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mix . " But soon at least half of the burnable half ) will be shipped to power plants ? a new kind of fuel to make electricity . As for the rest , magnets and separators will start mining it for ores : iron , copper , aluminum , zinc . Little waste eventually will go to the dump . for it 's hoped that the mix soon will also yield acids , chemicals like sulfur , color-sorted glass , and fibrous stuff for building materials . Experts are watching the Milford project with interest . For they 're realizing at last that ground-up waste such as the Brute turns out could be one of our greatest " natural " resources .
