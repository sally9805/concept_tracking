 | Outside the doctor 's rain-streaked office window , two dirty , gray city pigeons were ruffling their damp feathers on a crumbling ledge . I remember looking out , only for a second , and seeing them when the doctor gave me the news . You do odd , reflexive things when someone ? especially someone who is a doctor ? hands you the confirmation of a tragedy you have been dreading . Your mind switches defensively into neutral for a suffocating minute , but the heart 's motor still races . The doctor told me in as kind a way as he could that I was " effectively " sterile , that my sperm count was just too low , and that I would probably never be able to father children . It was possibly the result of the rheumatic fever I 'd had as a child , but he could not be sure . He tried to soften the blow by telling me that there are three and a half million couples like my wife and me in America and that sterility on the part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total . He shook his head slightly but kept his eyes steady on mine until I sighed and looked out of the window . FOR A MAN of 29 , in good health , starting out on a fine , new job that promised a good salary and steady advancement , the blow was doubly ironic . My wife , Jo , and I had purposely waited two and a half years after our marriage before trying to start a family . In the best Planned Parenthood tradition , we had waited and talked and speculated , saving what money we could in a special fund marked " kids . " But when she stopped taking the Pill ? and that had been many months ago ? she had n't gotten pregnant . I say " she " failed because that was how we both secretly thought about it . It was a classic situation , really . We made no rash assumptions ; carefully , we assigned no blame . But Jo meekly agreed to be " checked out " first , and clearly dreaded the results . " Normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tests were completed . Jo heard the news with a mixture of relief and fear ; I with thankfulness and growing anxiety . A few days later , feeling like a guy climbing the scaffold steps , I went for a checkup . And there the answer was , magnified under a highpowered microscope on a glass slide : one , lonely tadpole-like creature , squiggling frantically in a grainy circle of light , alive and kicking ? but alone . There should have been hundreds more on that slide . WHETHER A MAN is a poet or a truck driver , the word that he will never father his own child stabs him to his core . Suddenly , every beaming Sunday-morning father wheeling his kid along in a stroller , every young mother negotiating the grocery-store aisles with a businesslike frown and a fidgety toddler in the cart becomes a special , amazingly privileged person ? somebody with a secret power , a mysterious gift , a key to happiness . You can worry about the population explosion , you can live in filthy , violent cities , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do to children . Nonetheless , when young parents come trundling their babies along ? beaming , fussy , proud ? it hits you where you live . The urge to procreate , to foster new links in your chain of life , is not something that can be educated or legislated out of people . At first , I was so wrecked emotionally , I could n't think of anything except the fact that fate , cruel destiny or God ( I did n't give a damn which ) had singled me out , had deprived cc c what . as a logical result of a happy marriage , I wanted most in life : children who would complete and continue me as a man and Jo as a woman ; kids who , with the attributes of my wife ( her steadiness and gentleness ; her smooth , loving disposition . . . her big green eyes ! ) would add a unique , new element to the human equation . Though I knew how my parents had bickered raising their children , I knew that would n't happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One of my dreams , romantic but real , was a son for each knee . BUT IT WAS N'T to be . Numb and heartsick from our bitter knowledge , Jo and I took off ( " I 've got a family crisis and I need three clays to work things out , " I told my boss ) . We borrowed a friend 's house in the mountains , fleeing our apartment like people who want to get away from the scene of a tragic accident . For a couple of days , surprised at @#  | ourselves , we just held on to each other and wordlessly wept . I am not normally a somber or unhappy person , but at that point even the sight of tadpoles swimming in the sunlit shallows of a pond tightened a knot in my gut and squeezed tears of frustration from my eyes . It 's surprising , even a little frightening , how deep that initial pain can bite . After we returned from the mountains , I was sure I was on top of my sadness and now under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the street and wave and my equilibrium would crumble . My saddest moment took a long time in coming . ( I must have been fighting real acceptance of my situation all the way . ) It was Christmas Day , a year after we found out I was sterile . My older brother , whom we were visiting , had two daughters and an infant son . His wife had put the baby down for the night in a crib in the dining room , next to the tall tree festooned in lights and ornaments . We had all had a good day , and went to bed with plenty of Christmas cheer under our belts . About two o'clock in the morning , I woke up suddenly ? restless , hazy , vaguely sad . I wandered downstairs for something to read . I stole into the dining room and looked down at my new nephew who lay sleeping with his tiny fist curled under his chin . His chubby cheek and perfectly sculptured little ear were dappled with colored light from the tree . Standing there in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I felt as if the finger of death had been laid on me . " It ends here for me , " I thought , " it stops . " Part of an ancestral line stretching back for generations to green , cow-dotted pastures in southern Ger- many was ending with me ; I was ending . The image of a tree flashed in my mind , with one big branch lopped off and the bare wood showing white like some bloodless wound . Deep inside me , the tears suddenly came thumping , like exasperating knocks in the plumbing . I choked them back until I got out of the room where the baby was sleeping . But it was like a fever breaking . I poured myself three fingers of brandy and sat staring into the still-glowing remains of the fire in the living room , surrounded by the wreck of Christmas wrappings . I was not really ashamed of my tears , but now they seemed so useless . How long , I wondered , can I go on with all this maudlin misery ? How long can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself for what was actually a quirk of fate or an act of God ? I had been depressed by my lack of control over my emotions during the past year . But I also knew that my depth of feeling was proof of how much I wanted children and how much I would love them if we had them . Then I thought of Jo , sleeping upstairs . And , for the first time , I really began to focus on what she had been going through . Now , at last , I was ready to face it : Jo is a person who rarely complains , but she had been sending me subliminal signals all the time . And , until this moment , my selfconcern ( or self-pity ) had made me tune them out . Any wife whose husband turns up sterile might as well realize that ( at first , at least ) , her husband wo n't be thinking of her pain . He wo n't be aware of her double pain ? knowing she can conceive life , but he can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guilts and anguish . How can you " blame " a husband for something which is not really his " fault " ?  | And so Jo had been swallowing her frustration and anger , and suffering silently inside . If ever tears came welling up she had fought them back to avoid reminding me of our problem . Whenever a baby flashed across the TV screen ? part of a soap or diaper commercial , perhaps ? she had quietly found some excuse to leave the room . If we encountered a friend 's baby while visiting , she had denied herself the joy of cuddling him . On the surface , she had remained calm and brave : she had to be , she thought , to protect me . Inside , the pressure had been building up . Still , for all my newfound insight , we continued for months to rock along in our pattern of separate and silent suffering . When we finally broke out of our collusive shell of repression , it was not the result of a psychic thunderclap , but a completely banal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it must have been about six months after our Christmas with my brother ) , and someone we 'd met there had asked , as strangers often did , if we had any children . By now the question should n't have thrown us , but it did . I 'd hemmed and hawed and Jo had had to step into the breach and rescue me by changing the subject . But on the way home that night , she 'd said quietly , " Why do n't we just tell people we 're looking into adoption and let them draw their own conclusions ? " I remember blinking and saying , " You 've been thinking about adoption all along , without saying anything , have n't you ? " Jo admitted that she had been . Her admission opened up a long , late evening of soul-baring between us . As soon as we began discussing the adoption alternative , much of the psychological pressure lifted . Jo confided how numb and bombed-out she had felt in the beginning , how long the shock had taken to wear off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been repressing @# her true emotions ? anger and frustration ? and using me as an excuse , almost as if she were mothering me like a child . Did she think I was too weak to accept the truth ? Did n't her refusal to express her real feelings keep me in a child-like position ? We discovered with a jolt that . for a year or more , we had been skirting the issue , cooperating in fending off the hard fact of my sterility , like kids whistling in the dark . Now , out of the honesty of that talk , a new closeness could grow between us . We were no longer secret antagonists ; we could admit our feelings . One night on vacation a few weeks later , we walked alone on a Long Island beach under a windy sky with clouds scudding across the moon and stars . Being Midwest transplants , we both were overwhelmed by the rhythm of the ocean and the cascading boom of the surf dropping onto the sandy shore as it had for millions of years . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rollers that flashed and flickered under the cloud-chased moon . Sometimes revelations come to people simply because they have escaped their normal , workaday world and found themselves suddenly in touch with nature 's elemental processes ? the ceaseless grind of the sea , the scurrying of the forest animals beneath quiet trees , the spring promise of a waking field . That night , on the beach , we rediscovered our link with life , the life that goes on in spite of everything ; the vast , globe-girdling force in which we were two specks of shadow trudging the moon-swept sand . As we walked we talked about our fears and took stock of our strengths . I was afraid Jo could never fully love a man who could not give her children . As for her , she feared my anger and frustration would poison one of the qualities she said she treasured most in me ? the way I got along with children and the way they responded to me . She had always felt I would he a firm but loving father no matter whose kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . It was not my power or lack of power to give her children that concerned her , she said , as much as what kind of a father I would be now that I knew that any children we might have would not be truly my own . And though our sex life seemed unaffected physically by our knowledge of my sterility , my feelings of diminished manhood had turned into irritability , fault-finding and petty jealousy . That worried her too . The more we talked , the more I began to feel ? for the first time in my life ? that I was a man whose gift of life need not be dependent on any power to produce genetic particles encoded to create a copy of myself . I would be able to find myself continued in the chain of life not by a certain color of eyes or hair , but by the day-to-day process of giving to a child all that I could ? my knowledge , my support , my joy in discovery , my love . I 'm not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That night , the man frustrated in his faith in bloodand-genes procreation began changing into a man whose feeling of self-worth lay in the confidence that he could be as much or more of a father to his children as any other man . That change of attitude altered our lives . It was as though two hands that had futilely scrabbled to reach each other over a yawning chasm had finally contacted . locked together . The terrible waste of energy we had been putting into building false defenses and second-guessing each other was finished . We were ready to go on . Soon after our walk on the beach , we began seriously to explore the possibilities of adoption . They turned out to be bleak , almost hopeless . We quickly discovered , after getting in touch with agencies from Maine to California , that the sort of first child we wanted ( healthy , as young as possible and racially close to us ) was almost unobtainable . The popularity of birth control . easier abortion policies and even the growing fashion for unwed mothers to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in America . Choosing a baby , we learned , was out of the question : if we were to adopt at all , it would be a matter of simply taking what was available . Waiting lists for healthy infants ran into many hundreds at large agencies . And others told us we might have to wait another two years for a child ? with no assurance at that . But then we were getting desperate . Almost three years had passed since we learned of our problem and we were no closer to a family than when we started . One day Jo read of a fertility center in New York which reported encouraging results in overcoming sterility . Perhaps , we told each other , by now progress had been made . Perhaps in the intervening months science had  | found a cure for problems like mine . At any rate , it seemed worth looking into . Soon , at the fertility laboratory , Dr. Richard Amelar explained that while my sperm quality and count were low , the past five years had seen great advances in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hormone treatment was sometimes proving effective ; also , artificial insemination of the type using " split " semen specimens ( the first portion of the ejaculate contains the most and best sperm ) . A third approach was " rebound " therapy , involving the use of medication to turn off sperm production in the hope that production will bounce back stronger when the treatment is discontinued . I was skeptical but game . For six months thereafter , I reported twice a week for hormone shots to stimulate my sperm production . My backside was like a pincushion . I wondered if my boss figured I was seeing a shrink or a girl friend . The bus I took to the doctor 's office skirted Central Park , where on sunny days what seemed like hordes of young mothers and uniformed nannies paraded babies in prams and strollers . " If this does n't work , " I told Jo , " we 're gon na have to resort to kidnapping or the black market . " Sure , I was joking , but I was afraid to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been achieved . For me , there was no miracle . When the treatments failed to produce results , I took another nose dive into a long , deep funk . I drank too much ; could n't sleep ; was moody , morose and emotionally unpredictable . I walked through my days feeling like that Li'l Abner character with the unpronounceable name who carries a black cloud of bad luck over his head no matter how he tries to escape it . Now , I realize that what was aggravating my unhappiness was some kind of subliminal anticipation ? and dread ? of the decision I might soon be facing . For , way down deep , I knew that if medical possibilities had been exhausted , if there seemed no chance of adoption , there was still one option open to us . That option was artificial insemination ? using the sperm of an anonymous donor to impregnate my wife . The very thought of it made me shudder . But eventually I had to face it . And in that that I had one last battle to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man a man . Although I knew I would never have that precious , procreative talisman that gives men their meaning and their moxie , I burned at the idea of another man 's sperm in my wife 's womb , another man 's child growing inside her . How would Jo feel ? And if we did decide to go ahead with it , would I feel like a bystander , a fifth wheel , during her long months of pregnancy ? How would I react to watching my wife 's body respond and change to a strange man 's seed ? Oh , I could imagine the clinical reality of the insemination procedure : fluorescent light , white walls , glass tubes and rubber gloves ; the cold touch of the stirrups on bare feet , the crackle of fresh , white paper on the examination table ; the doctor chatting with as much gravity and lightness as his tableside manner could muster as he implanted the magical cells that would grow into a child . But I was angry and hurt by the thought . Would Jo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Besides a painful , unwanted humility , sterility imposes flashes of masochism and even paranoia on its male victims . ) I even wondered if a donor might not get curious , and seek out our name , or try to find out what sort of child he had fathered . Although frightened and confused by all this , I eventually was able to admit to myself that there was a child in me : a wounded ego , aching to throw another angry tantrum of frustration . That childish part of me , I finally recognized , was putting injured pride before the physical ( and emotional ) facts . Could I deprive Jo of the experience of carrying and delivering a child ? Could I deny her this crucial aspect of motherhood ? I realized I could n't . An even more compelling consideration was the fact that such a baby would be at least half ours , and that we could be sure that , before birth and during delivery , he would have the best medical care ? a certainty we would not have if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to clear up and the logic of artificial insemination became clear . By taking that course we would know our baby was properly nourished , that he had not been exposed to drugs ( a tremendous worry among adopting parents today ) ? that he would be the offspring of a healthy , happy mother who waited with joy and expectation for his birth , instead of an unhappy , confused girl who would give away her mistake as soon as he was born . We found out that more than 12,000 healthy babies are born annually by this insemination procedure in the United States , so we knew we were not alone in our dilemma or our hopes . And so we made the greatest decision of our lives . ... Last month the doctor reported to us that Jo is pregnant . We will never know the name of the sperm donor , never know where he lives , never be able to get in touch with him , or he with us . But we know this much about him : he is a medical student ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closely parallel to our own . Our baby will be born in the spring .
