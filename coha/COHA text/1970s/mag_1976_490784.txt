Notes and Comment AN occasional correspondent of ours who spends much of his time in the country has sent us a midsummer report . He writes : This year , for the first time , we have swallows nesting in the eaves of the barn , and I can hear what is practically the roar of bees in the honeysuckle outside my study window . Walking out to look at the garden the other morning , I almost stepped on a little greenish-tan toad . On the way back to the house by a different route , I almost stepped on another . Both , according to my copy of Conant 's " A Field Guide to Reptiles and Amphibians , " were Fowler 's toads . They were also the most toads of any kind I had seen in many years . A few days ago , I surprised a turtle  --  a brown-and-yellow box turtle about the size and shape of half a cantaloupe  --  in the act of laying what turned out to be four or five eggs in a hole . A day or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a catbird , a robin , a redstart , a grackle , and an indigo bunting take turns splashing in the birdbath . The indigo bunting was the first I had ever seen . That night , I fell asleep to the calling of a whippoorwill , and I woke up the next morning to the moaning of mourning doves and the peremptory whistling of a bobwhite . Driving over to the village post office a day or two ago , I saw a run-over cock pheasant , I saw a crow pecking at a run-over possum , I saw a sparrow hawk perched at the top of a dead sycamore tree , and I had to brake to avoid two bemused cavorting squirrels . When I got home , my wife said she had seen a three-foot blacksnake in the pachysandra , and that evening , at a cocktail party , a friend said he had seen three ospreys winging together across a marsh . This sudden and flourishing plenitude of wildlife got me to thinking . I thought , of course , of the late Rachel Carson and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of DDT , and that sent me to the World Almanac , and that gave me something of an answer . " Silent Spring " was published in 1962 , and the federal government 's ban on the use of DDT became effective on December 31 , 1972 . It took ten years , and Miss Carson did n't live to see it happen , but apparently she was right . Visitors WE were interested recently to learn that two French officials were coming to New York City in order to study la Grosse Pamme . Their aim was to observe city government in this country , so that they could take some recommendations hack to Paris , which will soon have its first mayor in over a century . ( In the hundred and five years since the uprising that resulted in the creation of the Paris Commune  --  at which time the mayor was run out of town  --  Paris has been governed by prefects appointed by the national government . But next March the municipal council of Paris will elect a mayor from among its members , bringing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other French cities . ) Since New York has not been exactly a garden of urban delights lately , we wondered why the visitors had decided to study our city , and we arranged to meet them after they had spent four days conferring with some of its more prominent citizens . On a Friday morning , we caught up with the visitors in an opulent , wood-panelled office at the Consulate-General of France , on Fifth Avenue . They were M. Francois Lcpine , who is the director of the office of the Secretary of State for Interior Affairs , and M. Bertrand Chardon , who is M. Lepine 's assistant . We found that both were young , thoughtful , urbane , diplomatic , inquisitive , hip , and English-speaking . They explained that although they planned to make short visits to Washington , Chicago , Los Angeles , San Francisco , Boston , and Montreal , they considered New York City the main focus of their inquiries . " We spoke briefly with Mayor Beanie , " M. Le-pine told us . " And we had longer interviews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and management  --  people like Mr. Donald Kummerfeld , who is the director of the Office of Management and Budget ; Mr. Felix Rohatyn , who is the head of the Municipal Assistance Corporation ; and Mr. William Ellinghaus , of A.T . &T.,; who is a member of the Emergency Financial Control Board . This afternoon , we plan to meet with Mr. Barry Feinstein , who is the secretary of the Municipal Labor Committee . " " The structure of city government is what we 're interested in , and also the impact of politics on government , " M. Chardon said . " Until now , Paris has been run by the central government of France . This has meant that Parisians have had no tnily local officials to whom they could take their grievances . The new law providing for a mayor represents a movement on the part of President Valery Giscard d'Estaing toward more local responsibility . It will bring our system somewhat closer to yours . New York and Paris have many obvious things in common  --  the exodus of large numbers of city dwellers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , there are important differences . Consider the fact that Paris has thirty-one thousand policemen and firemen for two and a half million citizens , while New York City has only thirty-seven thousand policemen and firemen for eight million citizens . " " There are fewer strikes by public employees in Paris , too , " said M. Le-pine . " This is largely because our municipal unions have very little bargaining power . And it would he impossible for Paris to go into debt , since the city has no authority to borrow , except from government agencies . " " One should remember that Paris is much more homogeneous than New York , " said M. Chardon . " For one thing , we do not have your ethnic diversity . And though Parisians may grumble , they do have a great sense of belonging to their city . They are  --  well , they are Parisians . " At this point , we referred to some of the governmental crises , political dramas , fiscal debacles , and other facts of life that are well known to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are not taking New York City as a model , " said M. Le-pine . " We are here simply to observe . And everyone we have talked to has been extremely optimistic . We 've sensed that the various groups  --  government , labor , business  --  are very eager to work together to solve your city 's problems . Furthermore , speaking for ourselves , we like New York . Last night , we saw ' The Threepenny Opera ' at Lincoln Center . Tonight , we plan to dine at Windows on the World , the restaurant at the top of the World Trade Center . Before we leave , we hope to attend a concert in Central Park . " " There is no question about it , " M. Chardon assured us with a smile . " New York is worth saving . " Homecoming FROM a letter from Shelburne , Vermont , signed by E. M. Frimbo , world 's greatest railroad buff : I 'm staying at the Shelburne Inn . I used to come down here from Burlington , seven miles to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the bathing beach at Shelburne Point . The dirt highway on which the inn was situate has at last given way to macadam  --  Vermont compromises reluctantly with " progress . " But the ell-urns alongside are even more stately , despite the ravages of the Dutch elm disease ; these are , after all , Vermont elms , and Vermont was an independent republic for fourteen years in the eighteenth century , before it joined the thirteen original colonies as the fourteenth state . My way north at the beginning of every summer ( since shortly after the War of Independence ) commenced at Grand Central Terminal in a parlor car of the Green Mountain Flyer , which in eight hours took me to the Burlington depot , whence it was only a short walk to the house where my mother was born . But Shelburne had been the family domain ( and I mean domain : six hundred and forty acres in all ) until my great-grandfather sold out and went to the big city ( Burlington ) . His domain was almost an independent country itself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iron bars and salt . He and his farmhands produced everything else they ate and wore and used . They even made the gunpowder with which my great-grandmother  --  according to the notches in the stock of her rifle  --  picked off four untoward Indians . The farm eventually became part of the vast estate of the Webb family , who by intermarriage with the Vander -- bilts became high potentates in the railroad industry . I can walk from the Shelburne Inn in a few minutes to the Shelburne Museum , which is in part a monument to the Central Vermont Railroad when it was under the jurisdiction of Dr. W. Seward Webb , as well as a monument to all the artifacts and memorabilia that will make New England a thing of joy forever . The largest artifact is the paddle-wheel steamer Ticonderoga , carefully beached on a grassy hillside but still looking as though she were just about to depart from her pier in downtown Burlington on her stately journey across Lake Champlain to Plattsburgh , New York , where we passengers could catch the evening Delaware &; Hudson train @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old Rutland Railroad , crossing the northernmost reach of Lake Champlain on the only causeway ever built entirely of marble  --  tailings and reject slabs from the workshops of the Vermont Marble Company , down in Proctor , in southern Vermont . Or we could go to Montreal by the Central Vermont . Life really offered options in those days . All these trains disappeared , the steamship Ticonderoga was beached forever , and I had n't been to Burlington or Shelburne in a dozen years . Then , a while ago , a cheerful young voice on the telephone asked me whether I would not like to return to ancestral territory in the only overland way I deem fitting . The Vermont Bicentennial Transportation Committee , in the goodness of its nostalgic heart , was preparing to foster a steam passenger train every day  --  except Tuesday  --  along the route of the old Rutland Railroad from practically the bottom of Vermont ( Bellows Falls ) to practically the top of Vermont ( Burlington ) . I replied at once that if the committee would be good enough to procure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Montreal , The Montrealer ( of course ) , I would he pleased to alight at Bellows Falls at three o'clock in the morning and , five hours later , join the first run of the Vermont Bicentennial Steam Expedition . Once aboard The Montrealer , I hastened to the dining car to have my first taste of two excellent dishes that the Amtrak management introduced earlier this summer for its French-speaking Canadian clientele  --  French-Canadian pea soup ( soupe aux tetits Pais d la Canadienne aux croutons ) and quiche Lorraine . Washed down with a draught of white wine , naturally . Awaking refreshed at my accustomed hour of three , I alighted at Bellows Falls . I was approached by a policeman , who said , " I 've been instructed to put you to bed for the night . " In his squad car , we drove along the main street to a hotel in which not a light was shining . My escort produced a key , let me into the foyer , and said , " According to law , I have to ask you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight o'clock , I had arrived at the new Bicentennial Parking Lot alongside the station from which the Bicentennial Steam Expedition would depart . A considerable crowd had already assembled , and I quickly realized , as I Es tened to the welcoming speeches , that this was to he not only a Bicentennial Expedition but a campaign train . I learned from the speeches , too , that somewhere on the premises of the parking lot the Bellows Falls Chamber of Commerce had buried a time capsule , the contents of which were unknown to everyone the day I was there . ( But call 802 463-4280 . For more pertinent information , such as the daily peregrinations of the new steam train , call 802 828-2236 . Do n't call me . ) The Steam Expedition is the first regular passenger train on the western slope of Vermont in a good twenty years and constitutes one of the most ambitious Bicentennial projects undertaken by any state . In towns where the old Rutland Railroad station had disappeared , the committee has put up cheerful little ones , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at several of these stations . Trains will be running through Labor Day . And why not ? The track of the old Rutland Railroad  --  just upgraded with a million dollars of federal money , on behalf of the Steam Expedition and the freight service now maintained over the line by the Green Mountain Railroad and the Vermont Railway , the Rutland 's heirs and assigns  --  runs through some of the most beguiling landscape on this continent . As it progresses through Addison County ( " Land of Milk &; Honey " ) , the eye and ear and nose become aware of the proliferation of cows  --  black-and-white Holsteins for bulk and brown jerseys for creaminess  --  and wild flowers , from which the county 's busy bees distill some of our finest honey , None of this honey was to be had in the little gift shop aboard the train , but the shop offered anything up to a quart container of Vermont Grade A maple syrup , a perfect condiment for acres of Vermont blueberry pancakes . ( Some of this acreage is always available at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will pick you up at the Shelburne station . ) The train is international , like the Amtrak dinner menu . It is hauled by one of the last and handsomest steam engines built for the Canadian Pacific Railway , and its cars are old Long Island Rail Road commuter coaches  --  considerably upgraded . Where else can you buy draft beer on a train , for instance ? The first run of this train got rapidly off schedule ; not all Vermont politicians are as taciturn as Calvin Coolidge , who went to high school in Ludlow , through which this train passes . Its progress was jolly : instead of looking like and sounding like a mid-Manhattan political rally , what happened in each little town , as the speeches were being made , looked more like a ballet out of " Oklahoma ! , " with the pretty wives and daughters , when available , of the candidates weaving through the crowds as they handed out propaganda . It was a kind of Musical Chairs : the governor is running for United States senator ; the lieutenant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a state representative is running for lieutenant governor ; and the young state Franking and insurance commissioner is running for secretary of state . They were all aboard ; maybe I missed a few others . One man who was definitely not aboard was the Honorable John Liccardi , State 's Attorney in Rutland , who opened his window to greet the first test run of the Canadian Pacific loco and got a cinder in his eye . He called up the state environmental affice to complain , and was told that the state 's environmental-protection law had been waived for this train . Vermonters know what they 're doing : no-deposit , no-return bottles are not permitted in the state ; in a few months there will he no billboards on any highways ; and the governor 's food commission has just recommended that Vermonters grow more of their own food . Which reminds me  --  nobody really minded the first-run delays , and nobody went hungry . There was plenty to eat for everyone in the grill car . There was also plenty of soot and cinders for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coal upon which steam locomotives are accustomed to subsist . The principal director of all this merriment is Committee Chairman and former Lieutenant Governor Jack Burgess , a well-spoken Vermonter , and a smart one , too . Burgess 's principal aide-de-camp in practical matters is Bill Sprinkle , fifty-five years a railroad man , and once a Navy machinist 's mate . Sprinkle 's major worry on the inaugural run was that something would not go wrong . Eventually , an axle under one car ran so hot that it was thought the car might have to he dropped from the train . Beaming , Sprinkle descended to the roadbed with his machinist's-mate kit and rapidly bathed and nursed the axle back to health , and we pushed on for Shelburne and Burlington . Unlike Rockefeller 's Williamsburg , the Shelburne Museum does not look like an M-G-M set for a musical about tile Revolution . It looks like an old , weatherworn Vermont village whose inhabitants have lovingly assembled out of their past an overwhelmingly varied assortment of things essential to or ornamental of life in old New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saucer , every dentist 's instrument of torture , every bootmaker 's nail , and they tell it with simplicity and glee . Vermont , our sister republic , is genuine Bicentennial country . It was n't made in a day , and shows it . It really is two hundred years old . Financial W omen WE lunched the other day with the Financial Women 's Association of New York , a group of intelligent and attractive Wall Street-oriented professionals , who invited us downtown to help celebrate their twentieth anniversary as an organization . The place was ( once more ) Windows on the World , the restaurant on the hundred-and-seventh floor of the World Trade Center 's west tower ; the company included a hundred and thirty-five feminine financiers and a scattering of male guests ; and the menu consisted of spinach pate , chicken Veronique , mashed broccoli , anisette ice cream , and Secretary of the Treasury William Simon , who made a stirring political speech plugging free enterprise ( " Ladies and gentlemen , the question is , are we going to promote the individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) during the after-luncheon coffee . Afterward , several Financial Women expressed disappointment at the Secretary 's failure to tackle any of the serious economic issues coming up in 1977 . " Who wants to listen to what you can read in the newspapers ? " said one . " I 'd like to ask him how he intends to run the Chase Manhattan Bank , " said another . " I asked him if we were really going to have a depression , " said a third , " and he just said , ' Nonsense , nonsense . ' " We arrived at Windows shortly before noon , ears popping slightly from the elevator ride , and found ourself in an enormous beige-carpeted , glass-walled room that contained two bars and clusters of well-dressed Financial Women ( there was a sprinkling of gray hair , but most members seemed to be in their twenties or early thirties ) , who were sipping drinks , chatting with the male guests and with one another , and admiring the view . On the south was Governors Island , an emerald dot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the miniature wharves and green swamps of New Jersey . Decorating the foreground were several local landmarks  --  including ( once more ) ham Ellinghaus , of A.T . &; T. ; Leon Levy , of Oppenheimer ; Paul Kolton , of the American Stock Exchange -- whose dark suits were silhouetted against a sea of pastel summer dresses . We shook hands with the F.W.A. president , Elaine Rees , a dazzling green-eyed brunette in a scoop-necked black-and-white dress , and discovered that she was a security analyst for the Dreyfus Corporation . " What do you analyze ? " we inquired . " Retail trade , cosmetics , soap , and home furnishings , " replied Mrs. Rees . " I prepare in-house reports in these areas for all our mutual funds . " We informed Mrs. Rees that we had encountered her group on a previous occasion  --  in 1957 , when they were calling themselves the Young Women 's Investment Association . " That was because women were n't permitted to join the Investment Association of New York , " she said . " We are now , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been coed fora long time . " " Has your own organization changed much ? " we asked . " We took our present name in 1971 , " said Mrs. Rees . " We 've dropped the cutoff age of thirty-five , since many of our members move into the really important jobs after forty . And we 've increased our membership from twenty-seven to a hundred and eighty . The original group was mostly security analysts  --  the first professional job open to women on Wall Street  --  but now we have bankers , stockbrokers , traders , management consultants , financial analysts , portfolio managers , economists , and even several lawyers . In the last few years , banks and brokerage houses have been aggressively ecnriting women for a wide variety of professional jobs . " Mrs. Rees passed us on to Bernadette Bartels , a petite brown-haired woman with a winning smile , who turned out to be a vice-president of Shaw &; Company , a brokerage house . " I 've developed a market-timing service , which I sell to institutional investors , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bar . " I study market action  --  trading patterns  --  and analyze it in terms of price and voltime fluctuation . Then I work with portfolio managers , telling them what to buy or sell in various industry groups or what stocks within industry groups they should concentrate on in terms of the perspective of the market . " " Do they pay attention ? " we asked . " Sometimes it is difficult to tell a senior portfolio manager that lie 's overstayed his welcome in a stock or an industrial group , or that the whole philosophy of the market is changing underneath him , " said Miss Bartels , " hut if my advice is consistently good over a six-month period , people really start listening . " We acquired a drink and met Ann Leven , the treasurer of the Metropolitan Museum ; Helen Meyer , the chairman of Dell Publishing ( who told us she had just helped arrange the sale of her company to Doubleday ) ; Virginia P'an , who is a special assistant in the foreign department of the Federal Reserve Bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plastic eyeglasses , who manages investor relations for McGraw-Hill . " Everybody on the Street is making alternative plans , " said Miss Abrahamson , " but we all know the market wo n't do anything dramatic until after the election . This year , there 's more Democratic sympathy on Wall Street than there was during the last election . But there 's also a fear that if the Democrats get in we may have five to seven years of a strong economy , with inflation . If inflation remains low , public confidence in the market may improve to the extent that mutual funds are favorably impacted . " " My impression is that people on Wall Street are wary of Carter , be cause he 's an unknown quantity , " said Mrs. P'an . " And everybody thinks that Carter 's going to owe an awful lot of favors if he 's elected . " When lunch was announced , we took a seat at a round table with Miss Bartels ; Margit Pearson , a management consultant with McKinsey &; Company ; Susan Dollinger , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T. ( " We raise about three billion dollars a year , and one of the things I work on is the timing of our issues " ) ; and Robin Krasny , a corporate lending officer at Irving Trust . " Women are making good incomes on Wall Street , because it 's a performance-oriented industry , " said Miss Dollinger , digging into her pate . " Your salary reflects how much business you do and how well you do it . We 've got Muriel Siebert , with her seat on the Stock Exchange , and Julia Walsh , who is a senior vice-president of a Washington brokerage house , but I 'd still like to see a woman partner in a major Wall Street firm . We do n't want to see women in staff positions  --  we want jobs with real authority . How many women are there above the vice-presidential level in banking ? " " Very few , " said Miss Krasny . " The early titles come quickly , so there are plenty of assistant treasurers and assistant corporate secretaries . But lots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City hanks , because the people who run them have an awfully difficult time distinguishing performance . For a young officer , I 've brought in a substantial amount of business , but that does n't mean I 'll get m5 second promotion any faster than the next person . " We asked Miss Krasny what she did at Irving Trust , and she told us that she was a corporate lending officer to the securities industry . " People who are not used to dealing with a woman are so surprised when you do a reasonable job that you usually come out ahead , " she added . " But sometimes it 's hard to break the image . The other morning in the subway , a man sat down next to me , looked at the squash racquet I was carrying , and said , ' Is that really yours , or are you taking it downtown for somebody else ? ' Now , who needs that So I told him  --  which is the case  --  that I play twice a week at the Princeton Club . "
