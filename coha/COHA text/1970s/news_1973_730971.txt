txt Pilot Michael Todd climbs into his six-seater Cessna here and flies 60 miles out over the Pacific Ocean . He throttles back to 100 miles an hour , opens a side window and empties a small linen bag out of it . Three pounds of pebble-sized particles bump along the fuselage and drift to the water below . The airborne cargo Mr. Todd is throwing out is the remains of a St. Petersburg , Fla. , man . The family of the deceased had mailed the cremated body to Mr. Todd . For $35 , Mr. Todd agreed to scatter the ashes at sea and provide a scenic color photograph of Cape Lookout or a similar vista near the spot where he made the drop . Although he does n't do so on this flight , he will also recite the Lord 's Prayer or bring along a minister to perform a service at no extra charge . Cremation and burial at sea are becoming increasingly popular along the West Coast , and interest in such funerals is spreading around the U.S. The rising cost of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including headstone ? as well as liberalized laws on spreading of ashes , are contributing to the popularity of simpler ceremonies , morticians say . In California alone , the remains of 7,159 people were scattered over the Pacific last year , nearly 40% more than the 5,194 in 1971 . Most " burials " were from planes , although 1,879 were performed from boats . Mr. Todd , 38 years old , says his business has tripled each year since he performed his first burial from the air four years ago as a favor for a funeral director . He now scatters ashes sent from all over the U.S. , performing 30 to 35 sea burials monthly . Mr. Todd , who is n't a mortician , prefers this work to his former job as a corporation pilot for several companies . " At least ashes do n't booze a lot , and they do n't get airsick , " ne says .

In 1926. ace World War I pilot Jimmy Doolittle scattered the ashes of football coach Andy Smith over Memorial Stadium at University of California 's Berkeley Campus . Nor is scattering of ashes confined to the West Coast . Reid H. Lowe , who owns three funeral homes in Miami , once laid a man 's cremated remains to final rest by dropping them over a racetrack . But the ocean  --  especially the Pacific Ocean ? seems to be the preferred locale for scattering ashes . " I think it 's because of the drama , the adventure of the spirit and love of the sea , " says J. L. Searles , president of Progress Industries Diversified , a St. Paul , Minn. , producer of television shows . Mr. Searles last year started an air-taxi subsidiary whose pilots scatter ashes off the Pacific , Gulf or Atlantic coasts . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Myron Reed , a Los Angeles pilot and mortician , created a " New Horizon " plan that has 154 rid-up members at $327 apiece .

The Telophase Society of San Diego , offers a comparable package deal for $265 ; it deposits ashes from a 36-foot boat . Fishermen , Pilots and Seamen Many of those who choose to be cremated and buried at sea are fishermen , pilots or merchant marine seamen . But a large number of physicians and nurses also select the ocean burials , says Thomas B. Weber , president of the Telophase Society , which is named for the last stage in the division of living cells . The society in particular and burial at sea in general have cony under much criticism , often from the more traditional elements of the funeral business . The society , which was formed in 1971 , was initially attacked because it had neither a funeral director 's nor a cemetery broker 's license , and last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ license . Some think that is n't enough , however . They charge that a funeral director 's license is needed , too , alleging that at one time the society kept bodies in an unrefrigerated garage for 48 hours or more . ( " We now have a custom-built , walk-in refrigerator that holds 15 , bodies , " says Mr. Weber . " No funeral director in California has one like it . " ) The society charges a $15 membership fee and $250 for its services , which one critic has described as a " quick disposal " operation . That apparently is what a lot of people want , however . Telophase already has 5,000 members in Southern California , some of whom were recruited with such techniques as Blue Chip Stamp giveaways . The whole concept of scattering cremated ashes at sea has also run into opposition from crematorium and cemetery operators and from certain religious groups . " I just ca n't see someone SPreing mother out to sea in a cardboard box and then dumping her into the ocean , " says Jack R. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It lacks sentiment and goes against our religious beliefs . " Mr. 011erenshaw manages the Rose City Cemetery in Portland . " It 's kind of shockpeople who find them and shocking to people who are members of the deceased 's family . " Another criticism of the practice is that there are no permanent memorials at sea . " It strikes me as being contrary to the whole concept of a Christian burial  --  with its proper disposition and care of remains , " says Monsignor James T. of San Francisco , vice president of the National Catholic Cemetery Conference . Monsignor has asked the organization to reaffirm Catholic support for cemetery interment and , possibly , to forbid Catholics from having their ashes scattered . " Right now , we really do n't know what to say when someone asks if this is okay in the Catholic church , " he says . ( Since 1963 , the church has permitted cremation , however . ) But those who advocate ocean burials as an alternative to costly funerals dispute these criticisms . Jessica Mitford , author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cremation association 's opposition to scattering is based on greed , not sentiment . Crematorium profits derive mainly from the sale of urns and niches , Miss ' Mitford says . " So what 's good taste to them is what 's of interest to them in terms of their financial interest . " In addition , Mr. Todd says he uses a grinder to break down bone fragments to the consistency of heavy boach pebbles . And since he strews the ashes two miles or so off the coast , he says none wash up on shore . The Portland pilot also defends his clients ' supposed lack of sentiment in selecting his service . " Persons who have cremated ashes scattered were very emotionally attached to this person , " he says . After all , " what larger , more impressive memorial could there be than the Pacific Ocean ? People claim life began in the ocean , and now they are going back . "
