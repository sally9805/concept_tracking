For much of their six-year history , the Black Panthers wandered in a wilderness of violence , both rhetorical and real . They packed guns and often sounded eager to use them . Yet that fractious history was nowhere evident recently in Oakland , Calif. , as a neatly dressed candidate for mayor listened intently to an integrated group of elderly voters . They were complaining about muggers and purse snatchers . " I know the roughness in this community , " the candidate replied . " My own mother 's purse has been stolen . I plan to offer a program to stop muggings and prevent this constant preying on the elderly . " <P> The tableau was familiar , but the unlikely candidate was Bobby Scale , 36 , co-founder and chairman of the Black Panthers . Panther Defense Minister Huey P. Newton , 30 , who founded the party with Scale in 1966 , and now plays Mao to Scale 's Chou , has explained the shift toward moderation- " The Black Panther Party is not a separatist party . We believe that it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and becoming more so because of the advancements in technology . As victims of racism , we wo n't take up that banner . " <P> Gaining Access . By this reasoning , conventional politics has become a central activity . Scale seven months ago started putting together his mayoral campaign in the city that gave birth to the Panthers . His chances are at present uncertain , but other Bay Area Panthers have already proved that they can gain access to political power . Ericka Muggins , 24 , who only 19 months ago stood trial in Connecticut with Scale for murder , is today an elected member of the Berkeley community development council , the city 's antipoverty agency . Other Panthers have won six of the 18 positions on the West Oakland Model Cities governing board and four of the 14 seats on the Berkeley antipoverty board . Elaine Brown is now running for the Oakland city council . <P> Scale says that he plans a $50,000 campaign . Emphasizing racial cooperation , expanded local services and ghetto-improvement programs , he speaks to diverse audiences , including the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the San Francisco Lions Club . " I 'm running to represent the total city of Oakland , " he says . " The excessive rhetoric of three years ago just was n't conducive to our revolutionary struggle . We 're not dogmatic ; we want change , not anarchy . " <P> Many whites are unimpressed . Incumbent Mayor John Reading had earlier planned to retire after 6 years in office , but now may run in the April election for another term . " Scale does n't stand much of a chance , " Reading says . " The Panthers have a lot of sympathizers , but responsible minority citizens with jobs and property do n't want anything to do with them . " Oakland Police Chief Charles Gain also predicts a Panther loss at the polls , but admires Scale 's new attitude and strategy : " I do n't think they 'll accomplish all their goals in this election , but they may be able to establish a political base so they can try again .
