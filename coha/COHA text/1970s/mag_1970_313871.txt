A Bus Is Not a Bridge <P> Sir : It was heartbreaking to see the photo of the little girl holding the sign that said " I do n't want to go to school with the blacks " March 9 . I was sickened to think that any parent could knowingly corrupt his child with such senseless hatred . Until human beings cleanse themselves of bigotry , busing will do nothing to bridge the gap between the races . <P> STEVAN SYLVESTER <P> Brunswick , Me . <P> Sir : Do that child 's parents realize that in hanging their hate message around her neck , they have truly hanged their own daughter ? <P> BARBARA MAURIELLO <P> Oxford , England <P> Sir : On behalf of myself and other concerned Georgians , I wish to offer an apology to the black people of this country for our Governor 's offensive and distasteful behavior in the Capitol restaurant . Ironically , it has been our gracious Governor who has been acting like " an ass and a baboon " for the past four years . Lester Maddox has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the last time . In the future , everyone else will sympathize with Georgia 's " problem . " <P> DIANNE DAY <P> Smyrna , Ga . <P> Sir : You failed to state that much of the slowing of integration is due to the actions of the Negroes themselves . <P> In this city , Negro high school students in an integrated high school struck , demonstrated and caused various difficulties because there were no " black studies " offered in the curriculum . Such studies are offered as an elective in every college and university in this area . As one white parent commented : " We speak French and my family arrived in Louisiana shortly after Bienville laid out the city of New Orleans ; however , I do not expect that French history and culture should be taught my child in a public high school . If they are so anxious to be first-class American citizens , let them study American history . " <P> A local private Negro college has let it be known that it wishes to be " all black . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon as possible . <P> The Black Panthers , excessive demands and segregation in reverse are hardly conducive to good race relations . <P> JOHN W. HILLTON <P> New Orleans <P> Sir : " Retreat from Integration " will undoubtedly strengthen the myth that racism and bigotry are unique to white America . Truth is , there is n't a country on earth where large populations of two different races live in harmony . <P> The Irish hate the British , and the British hate the Jamaicans in their midst ; the Swedes hate Norwegians ; most Europeans hate Russians ; Russians hate everybody . Frenchmen hate Germans and vice versa ; Arabs and Jews hate each other . Malaysians and Indonesians hate Chinese ; Chinese hate everybody . All tribes in Africa hate one another ; Pakistanis hate Indians and vice versa , ad infinitum . <P> So take heart , racists and bigots of America ; shed your hair shirt . You 've got plenty of company the world around . <P> C.H. ALEXANDER <P> Phoenix              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
