Trash is too flattering a label ; even refuse once meant something to someone . These dilated sketches merely constitute another Andy Warhol movie . This time the Master has tiptoed into the background as producer . The direction , writing and photography are all ascribed to Paul Morrissey , Warhol 's publicist , who carries on in the gland tradition . <P> The victim of all this Warhollery is Joe ( Joe Dallesandro ) , a hackneyed , acned chap who goes in for definition of musculature and vagueness of purpose . Joe turns on a chorus line of ladies , gentlemen and hermaphrodites . Alas , Joe himself turns on solely for heroin ; he is impotent . Among those he unfulfills : a go-go dancer ( Geri Miller ) , a sex-parched housewife ( Andrea Feld-man ) , and last and by every means least , a raucous female impersonator named Holly ( Holly Woodlawn ) . In the film 's climactic scene , Holly stuffs a pillow under its sweater , feigning pregnancy to con an uptight , upright social worker out of welfare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; Co. to their ultimate alchemy , the recovery of gold from garbage .
