PRIVATE LIVES by NOEL COWARD <P> It is always dismaying to see a gifted actor or actress destroy a well-earned reputation through arrant self-indulgence . In the past two or three years , Britain 's Maggie Smith has embarked on this melancholy course , and the dispiriting results have been on livid display on the stage of Los Angeles ' Ahmanson Theater for the past five weeks . Four years ago on this very stage , in The Beaux Stratagem , Maggie Smith spoke English as if it were the eighth wonder of the world . Today , as Amanda in Private Lives , she whines , gibbers and snorts with all the grace of an untutored Eliza Doolittle . <P> Nor is that , sad to say , all . She has become a compendium of swoops , twitches and all sorts of physical mannerisms . Los Angeles must indeed be the City of the Angels , for during the show 's run its citizens poured over $100,000 a week into the coffers of this theater and got a two-bit performance in return . And more illicit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Denver , Chicago , Boston , Toronto and New York . <P> Phlegmatic Dumbos . Amanda and Elyot ( John Standing ) are two fiendishly theatrical people who wear their ennui with ill-concealed hysteria . Having suffered the raptures and torments of marriage to each other , they put their hearts in a deep freeze . Divorced for several years , they are each on second honeymoons , having married two dolts from dullsville . All Coward plays are divided between two sets of people-bright , neurotic sophisticates and starchy , phlegmatic dumbos . Amanda and Elyot and their spouses meet on the adjoining verandas of a French Riviera hotel , and in no time at all Amanda and Elyot are making the glottal sounds of love again . <P> The first thing that seems to have escaped Director John Gielgud is his cast . It may have been too herculean a task to tone down Maggie Smith . But Gielgud ought to have elicited something more from John Standing than a replica of a rubber duck . As for the two who play the marital also-rans , Niki Flacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one known art-taxidermy . <P> What is even more puzzling is why Sir John , a man far from devoid of intellect , should have totally ignored the fact that Private Lives is a romantic comedy and not a knockabout farce to be milked for cheap , rowdy laughs . However they may strike us 44 years after the play was written , Amanda and Elyot were meant to be romantic names . The one song in the play , Some Day I 'll Find You , is as seductive as a dizzying perfume . This production exudes merely a sorry stench . T.E.K.
