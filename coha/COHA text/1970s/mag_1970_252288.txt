BLIND LOVE &; OTHER STORIES by V. 5 . Pritchett. 246 pages . Random House . $5.95 . <P> <P> V. S. Pritchett , one of the best of British critics , is also the master of a less fashionable art , the short story . His tales are old-fashioned in the way that a box-Brownie snapshot of a posed family group seems to belong to some other time ; they have much the same kind of truth and absurd dignity . Samples : BLIND LOVE . A short novel , really . Blind London banker has secretary-companion with birth mark that spreads a liver stain from below a high blouse-collar over one breast . Her husband left her after one night . Banker has house with swimming pool within easy Rolls Royce distance of London . He likes to swim , she can not . Also on hand is a quack faith healer . These elements might have been mixed into some sort of vulgar melodrama ; with Pritchett , the story becomes a parable of the things that divide and unite man and woman . Love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge and of touch . <P> THE NEST BUILDER . Perhaps to prove that he is not hopelessly square in the old Dickensian way , Pritchett enters the homosexual scene with a funny story of two interior decorators-funny without sneers or sniggers . It offers neither tea and sympathy nor pot and empathy . Eventually , fox-hunting girl redesigns one decorator . <P> THE SKELETON . This is Pritchett 's revenge on Soames Forsyte ( now , after 40 years , known to untold millions thanks to TV ) . In Pritchett 's sly version , Soames would have been less likely to play the Man of Property with Wife Irene than permit an impropriety with Lover Bosinney . <P> THE SPEECH . A sad study-seen from within the bosom of a lifetime New Statesman contributor-of the hatred and contempt a professional leftist holds for the " workers " she would nudge to the barricades . <P> Pritchett 's voice is slightly cockney , a tone entirely appropriate , as it happens , to his subject . For his heart belongs to that peculiar , sprawling , provincial , shabby , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That , too , is for the best . Social comedy like Pritchett 's might easily turn sour if it were not based on a heart that resists transplant .
