 | been at headquarters since five o'clock . And before that , I slipped out of the office to see Kathleen Omara . " " Have a sandwich , " urged Ruthie , who had one sovereign cure for fatigue . " Was it bad , Mary ? " Mary was not expansive . " She 's taking it as well as you 'd expect . It 's Frank 's father who was really hit hardest . " There was a moment of silence compounded of true sympathy and a little embarrassment at how easy it is to forget the sufferings of others . " Oh well , " said Mary wearily . Then , in a deliberate change of mood : " Then , down at headquarters , we had over two hundred people . In less than three hours . " Ruthie brightened . " Did you pass out more question-naires ? " " Questionnaires ! " Mary laughed shortly . " That was n't what they wanted . They wanted the Pill ! They seem to think we 've got some sort of stockpile . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a good many misconceptions as to the nature of the Parents League had arisen . " And when you come to think of it , " Pat mused , " I suppose the name Parents League does n't help . " But Ruthie was just coming to grips with the implications of Mary 's report . " Do you mean there were Catholics coming in for the Pill ? " she asked , wide-eyed . " Ruthie , they were all Catholics . " " Well , I do n't understand , " Ruthie marveled . " They know it 's against the teachings of the Church . If they want spacing , why do n't they use rhythm ? " Mary and Pat simultaneously opened their mouths , then shut them . Six years had intervened between Ruthie 's two children . Like everyone in the sodality , Mary and Pat had heard all about those endless trips to doctors demanding to become pregnant .  | " Some people , " said Pat , looking elsewhere , " have trouble with it . " " Why do n't we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Come on out to the kitchen with me , Sal . " Ruthie was seeing a whole new world . " Do you mean to say that there are womenwomen here in St. Bernadette 's , I meanwho are using contraceptives ? " she demanded . " I think there probably are . And now , " Mary continued with malice , " they 've got Father James on their side . " Pat was indignant . " It 's just like him . Who cares what he thinks about contraceptives ? After all , anybody who wants the Pill can get it without outside help , " she said , thereby completing Ruthie 's exposure to truth plain and simple . " But you ca n't get a parochial school by yourself . " When Bob and Sal cautiously returned , Mary seized the opportunity to change the subject . " And Mr. Richard Unger is n't going to help us with a parochial school either . So I say we should send him a polite refusal . " Sal was not so sure . " You know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " Mary was disappointed . " Sal ! " she exclaimed . " Do you care whether smart shops and expensive apartments come to Flensburg ? I thought you were worried about St. Bernadette 's . " " Sure I am , " Sal said quickly . " I know Unger is just trying to sweeten us up . What I 'm saying is this . Maybe we should be trying to sweeten him up . " The members of the Parents League were a straightforward lot . They reacted to this suggestion with alarm . " What the hell for ? " Bob asked aggressively . " Because we have to face facts , " Sal insisted . " You know what 's going on . We have n't even been able to talk to Monsignor Miles on the phone for three days . Every time we try , he 's on the long-distance line to Rome . "  | " Maybe , " suggested Ruthie , " he 's talking to His Eminence about us . " " Fat chance ! " growled her husband . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about us . We 're too unimportant . What we need is some kind of middleman . Someone who can talk to Monsignor Miles and who knows our position . " Sal spread his hands flat on the table and looked around for approval . Bob Horvath was skeptical . " What makes you think the Monsignor has got time to talk to Unger in the middle of this donnybrook ? " " Four million dollars , " Sal said flatly . " That 's what Unger 's got that we have n't . " " Ah ! " It was a long sigh of appreciation . Pat , of course , was an immediate convert to her husband 's cause . " Well , that makes two of you for Mr. Unger . But I still say it 's a terrible idea to give in to him , " Mary Foster said stubbornly . " Now , Mary , you ca n't deny that money talks . As a politician , you know that , " Horvath rumbled . " I do n't deny it , " Mary retorted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " " It ca n't do any harm to be polite to the man . I vote for Sal going . He 's better at this sort thing than I am and , anyway , I ca n't take the time off . " Ruthie , already alarmed by the cuts in Bob 's check caused by funeral attendance and League activities , supported him immediately . " All right . " Mary gave in good-humoredly . " I agree that there 's no point in all of us going . And I still do n't see what good it will do . " " Did it do any good ? " Thatcher asked twenty-four hours later .  | " I do n't know if you could say that exactly . " Unger was evasive . " It certainly turned out differently than I expected . The Ianellos came together , and I was ready to do a real job on them . That complex we built over in Richmond is our prize effort . So I started them off in the office with a whole series of blown-up shots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empty stores like that place they 're using for their headquarters , ramshackle houses , vacant lots that are turning into unofficial dumps . " " I know what a rundown neighborhood looks like , " Thatcher prodded . Unger emerged from the tone poem he was composing . " Yes , yes , of course . Whenever I could , I pointed out similarities to Flensburg . " " Not too offensively , I trust ? " " I put it very well , I thought , " Unger replied modestly . " Then I drove them out to the development . Really , you would n't believe it 's the same place . Everything rebuilt , everything clean , not a vacancy for ten blocks . I pointed out the conveniences of having all these services at hand . From there I moved into my big pitch . I said when you 're thinking about your children , you have to think about the community as a whole . " Unger halted , apparently for applause . " And what did they say ? " Unger came back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peculiar thing happened , " he admitted . " They started to talk to me ! They said they realized that I operated as a builder . But there were times when I should stop looking at things like a businessman and look at them like a whole man . That I had a stake in the communities of the city even if I did n't live there . " For the first time , Thatcher wished that he had taken part in this expedition . " Who won ? " He was genuinely interested .  | " I suppose you could call it a draw . They agreed to tell the Parents League what I said . And I agreed to tell Monsignor Miles what they said . " " I wonder , " Thatcher mused , " if Ianello has ever considered working for a bank . " In spite of momentary bewilderment , Unger pressed on . " But I was saving my real ammunition for the end . After we 'd been all around , I explained that a development was like a stone thrown into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year ago , a big shopping center was put up only half a mile away . I said I knew Mrs. Ianello would be interested . That was my big mistake . " " Oh ? " " I should have remembered that Sal Ianello manages an A &P."; He brooded for a moment . " No sooner did they see that A &P; than they both lit up and dived inside . I could n't get them out for over an hour and a half ! " " Enthusiasts , eh ? " " They started by routing out the manager and introducing themselves . The manager had just been promoted from a store like Ianello 's . So we had a long discussion about promotion policies and the rate of new store-openings . All up and down the East Coast . " " A matter in which you have some interest , " Thatcher observed . It seemed to him that Unger had asked for everything he got . " That 's not what I 'm complaining about . " Unger paused to review his misfortunes . " Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's astonishing to me that anybody can find so much to argue about in the arrangement of a supermarket . I thought they were all pretty standardized . " Thatcher had ceased to be surprised at the minutiae exercising specialists many years ago . For all he knew , every library was filled with people still debating the finer points  | of the Dewey Decimal System . He was prepared to concede that it was never very interesting for the bystander . " Does Mrs. Ianello share her husband 's interest in these matters ? " " She 's a shark , " Dick Unger said vividly . " A shame . So often one can rely on the wives to damp down these exchanges . " Dick Unger then proved that the real estate business does not destroy a man 's capacity for fair-mindedness . " As a matter of fact , parts of it were fascinating . Did you realize that the arrangement of a supermarket is a lot like a real estate subdivision ? Instead of talking about so many feet of frontage , you 're talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice began to warm with enthusiasm . " The big problem is the amount of display space you give any single item . This becomes critical when you get to items like detergents and breakfast cereals . There , you really have to figure out your returns with a slide rule . . . " As a tidal wave of information broke over his head , Thatcher was left to reflect that Dick Unger 's salesmanship was curiously unfocused . He had , it appeared , let the young Ianellos do as much selling as he did . Now he seemed to be forgetting the reason for this visitthe all-important Sloan mortgage money . " Did you get much of an impression about what 's going on in Flensburg ? " he asked . " It 's hard to say , " Unger said repressively . " Things change from minute to minute . " Thatcher decided to press harder . " Tell me , do you still think that you 're going to be able to go ahead with this apartment building ? In the light of everything that has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Yes , I do , " he said . It was a forthright , deeply felt affirmation . Thatcher only wished he knew exactly what deep feelings it represented .  | After seeing Unger off the premises , Thatcher was brought back to the workaday world by a reminder from Miss Corsa . Walter Bowman was still awaiting approval for a list of proposals for the Investment Committee meeting the next morning . A sliding market is more of a test than sunnier times . Thatcher decided to inform his research chief personally that three pet ideas must go . Bowman was deep in conversation when Thatcher arrived at his office . Perched on a corner of the desk was Charlie Trinkam , expounding vigorously . " ... and Catherine says that all this hell-raising symbolizes a rebirth of the Catholic Church . Of course , you have to take into account that she 's not detached . But still . . oh , hello , John . We 're talking about your buddies in Flensburg . I hear they 've taken up birth control now . " Meticulously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tooth and nail . " That 's not what the Daily News says , " Trinkam reported cheerfully . Thatcher knew this contribution did not reflect blind 104 1  | faith in the accuracy of the Daily News . Charlie was simply pointing out that , for all practical purposes , what tabloids said was what people believed . " Besides , the News is probably doing them a favor , " Charlie persevered . " The big thing about this Catholic revolution is that it 's based on social issues . " " The parochial school is a social issue , " Thatcher replied . " And they already had that one . " " That 's where things get tricky . According to Catherine , when you 've got a whole spectrum of issues , you pick the one with current social relevance . What she means , " said Charlie , resorting to translation , " is you have to pick the one that people are ready to raise Cain about . And the one that 's big right now is sex . " " Hence , birth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flensburg does n't seem to see things that way . " " Well , they 're not stuck with it . Do you think , " Charlie offered helpfully , " your people would prefer abortion ? " Unbidden , the faces of the Parents League appeared before Thatcher 's eyesthe Ianellos , the Horvaths , the Fosters . " No , " he decided , " they would not . " " That 's what Catherine thought , " Charlie said with satisfaction . Everyone at the Sloan was familiar with Charlie Trinkam 's techniques . Given any complex or novel situation , he attached himself to a woman with some claim to expertise on the subject . As Charlie was genuinely interested in all sorts . of womenas well as all sorts of attachmentshe had no difficulty implementing this policy . It usually left him the best informed man at the bank . Few women , however , had played such havoc with his vocabulary . " Who , " Walter Bowman demanded , " is this Catherine ? " Charlie beamed proudly . " Catherine was a nun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | There was an awestruck silence . Then Walter Bowman editorialized . " Boy , " he said admiringly , " it takes all sorts , does n't it ? " It was not clear to Thatcher whether this was in reference to Catherine or to Charlie . He did not care to pursue the matter . " Tell me , " he inquired , as usual taking advantage of Charlie 's peculiar insights , " what does she say about the ' current upheaval ? On the worldwide scene , I mean . " Charlie quoted dutifully . " She says that the reformers who talk about the Church 's lack of involvement with social issues are historically inaccurate . The Church 's structure is designed for involvement . But the structure has gotten frozen , and social patterns have changed . What 's going on is the travail of realignment . Incidentally , she says that birth control and abortion are just two facets of the central problem of our times . " " Sex ? " Walter had fallen into the trap . " No , " Charlie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says the Church has got a lot to learn there . " For an unguarded moment Thatcher found himself wishing he could be a fly on the wall at one of these tete-a-tetes . It was clear enough what Catherine said . But what did Charlie answer ? Walter Bowman clumped in where angels fear to tread . " And what do you say to that ? " Charlie 's insouciance was undimmed . " Catherine claims that I 've got a lot to learn there , too . She 's joining the Women 's Liberation Army . " Now it was John Thatcher 's turn to admire . He had no doubt that where Catherine led , Charlie would follow . Which meant that the Sloan was shortly going to have an in-house expert on the Movement . If predictions were right , they could use one .  | " After she 's been in awhile , " he said , " perhaps we can talk about it . In the meantime , let me make a few points to Walter . " But the groundwork had already been laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his favorites had lost ground steadily . Charlie Trinkam had been rubbing this in before they had both been sidetracked by Catholicism in our time . Walter was temporarily a broken man . " All right , John , " he agreed sadly . Then he rebounded . " I 'll have a new list for you next week . " As Thatcher returned to his quarters , he reflected that , in their own ways , Walter and Charlie were both worth their weight in gold . These pleasurable reflections were brought to a halt . A low bass rumble was emanating from Miss Corsa 's office . Thatcher had been hoping for an uninterrupted hour at his desk . Even more important to his well-being , Miss Corsa had been sharing that hope . The most notable basso at the Sloan was Innes from International Division . If Innes wanted to complain about the Sloan 's posture in Chile , he could eat up an hour . These days , Chile required at least that much time for weeping and lamentation . Thatcher approached the doorway and stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a man sitting beside her desk . Only his back was visiblea thick , weatherbeaten neck , powerful shoulders , and a gabardine windbreaker emblazoned : CONNOR 'S VANS ARE ON THE MOVE . This was not a common sight in the executive offices of the Sloan Guaranty Trust . Even more unprecedented was the fact that Miss Corsa was too engrossed to notice his presence . " . . . and putting the Mass into English , " Miss Corsa was saying indignantly . " My grandmother does n't understand English ! " " Hey , now ! " The man was delighted . " Neither does my  | grandmother . She has a tough enough time with confession since she moved up from Altoona . Of course , I suppose you could say that she does n't know Latin either , but she was used to Latin ! " " That 's it ! " The two of them were getting on famously . " It 's not right to go upsetting old people like thatoh , there you are , Mr. Thatcher . " The man turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bob Horvath . As they shook hands , Horvath mumbled something about not knowing if Mr. Thatcher had time . " Mr. Horvath has come to tell you about the latest developments at St. Bernadette 's . " Miss Corsa 's voice was the deferential voice of a perfect secretary , but Thatcher could take direction as well as the next man . " Splendid , " he said , opening the inner door and ushering his guest to a chair . While Thatcher busied himself moving a pile of papers from the desk to a side table , Horvath rambled into an opening statement . " I do n't know whether this is a bother to you . I was down here signing papers at Mr. Ericson 's office and he said you ought to have a copy . And , when I told her about it , Rosie said you 'd understand , so I thought we could talk about it . " The pile of papers remained suspended an inch above the table top . Thatcher froze for a full ten seconds , like the recipient of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thunderbolt should have instantly destroyed the office . He knew that if he ever referred to Miss Corsa as Rosie , there would be a mushroom cloud . " Yes , " he said , " yes , let 's talk about it . " " First of all , I 've got this paper . " For a moment Horvath was bemused by the large capitals on the blue cover .  | " Robert C. Horvath vs . Joseph , Cardinal Devlin . Geeze , it makes you think , do n't it ? " Thatcher tried to break through the haze of wonder enveloping Horvath . " Ericson is ready to go ahead , I take it ? " he encouraged . " Yes , " Horvath agreed unenthusiastically . " But it 's only fair to tell you , it 's not going to be like it was before . We 've got this Mrs. Kirk on our necks , for openers . " " Mrs. Kirk ? " " She 's that birth control dame . " Manfully Horvath curtailed further description . " You know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name had escaped me , that 's all . " " She 's doing her best to turn this into a three-ring circus . We do n't like it , but we do n't want people to get the wrong ideas . " Thatcher was beginning to realize that communication with Horvath would be largely a matter of divination . " You mean , you do n't want the Sloan to think you support her ? " Horvath was astonished . " Hell , no ! Who would ? No , I mean that Pat and Sal saw that guy from the real estate company . He thinks the Parents League is folding . And Father James has been telling people what the Monsignor thinks . A lot of you are getting the wrong idea . You think maybe we 'll give up or get swamped or something like that . But we 're not going to . We do n't like Mrs. Kirk . But if we have to , well . . . " His voice petered out with distaste . " If you have to , you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else put it into words . " That 's right . " " And things are going to be uglier than any of us originally supposed ? " Suddenly Horvath stopped having a hard time with words .  | grandmother . She has a tough enough time with confession since she moved up from Altoona .

" The pile of papers remained suspended an inch above the table top . Thatcher froze for a full ten seconds , like the recipient of a powerful but not fatal electric shock . By rights , a thunderbolt should have instantly destroyed the office . He knew that if he ever referred to Miss Corsa as Rosie , there would be a mushroom cloud . " Yes , " he said , " yes , let 's talk about it . " " First of all , I 've got this paper . " For a moment Horvath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . under way . If you can prevent the sale long enough , we will inevitably withdraw our support from Unger Realty . But you realize that there are other banks who might provide funds . " " The place seems full of them , " Horvath said disapprovingly . " On the other hand , I am told that ' Willard Ericson is an expert at stalling . " Thatcher paused uncertainly . Did Horvath understand what he was saying ? That with enough delays and enough notoriety , the reaction of most banks would be the same as the Sloan 's ? Surprisingly Horvath chose to revert to the subject of murder . " The police have been asking everybody about that last meeting Frank attended . When he got all upset about someone using the Parents League . They think he talked with someone and got clubbed down while he was at it . " " They asked me about that , too . " Horvath was interested in this news . " Then , " he said heavily , " I suppose they talked with Unger too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Yes , they did , " Thatcher replied without elaboration . " If the cops get that murder cleared up , it will make life in Flensburg a lot easier , " Horvath announced , rising to his feet . Thatcher was not sure what this interview had accomplished . Horvath seemed easier in mind than he had been . That was all to the good , of course . But as he led the way to the door , Thatcher wondered why . Horvath paused at the door . " You know , Mr. Thatcher , this trip has cheered me up . " He had the big man 's awkward smile . " With the Parents League getting to go to court after all , and with you people at the Sloan helping outwell , I think things in Flensburg may start calming down .

Then , probably because Charles Darwin and Sigmund Freud between them made man uninteresting , attention was returned to the second member of the partnership . How can God dispose , somebody wondered in print , when God is dead ? The subsequent outpouring of intellectual thought strained library facilities throughout the world . But the man in the street ( and the man on the steppe ) had better things to do with his long winter nights than speculate about free will , the categorical imperative or the natural law . Unnoticed , the population of the world grew by leaps and bounds . Finally , an unbiased witness could have made the following observations : all traffic in London had ground to a three-hour halt , airplanes were stacked up 112  | over Frankfurt airport for ninety minutes awaiting landing space , and three overburdened mountainsides in southern California were sliding inexorably into the Pacific Ocean .

A long and unprofitable meeting with Father Doyle had convinced Monsignor Miles and Dick Unger that affairs had moved beyond their control . " Nor , " said Monsignor Miles , " is there any reason to believe that Mrs. Kirk will prove the worst of our trials . " Father Doyle , who comfortably believed that archdiocesan officials were protected from the hurly-burly of parish life , was alarmed at gloom surpassing his own . " Is n't it bad enough ? " he growled as they emerged onto the porch of the rectory and waited for the car . As he spoke he waved a disgusted hand . Obligingly Miles surveyed the scene . Mrs. Kirk and her determined band were still pacing up and down : AS MANY CHILDREN AS WE CAN CARE FOR THE RHYTHM METHOD HAS NO REASON CHILDREN ARE TO LOVE There were a dozen of the ladies . Watching them with lackluster eyes was a lone policeman , courtesy of the New York Police Department . Behind him , parked at the curb , was a Volkswagen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ METROPOLITAN COUNCIL OF CONCERNED LAYMEN . The side doors were open to reveal a table , piles of literature , and a fat man ready to instruct any member of the parish bold enough to approach . Since it was three o'clock in the afternoon , the street was otherwise quiet . Occasional shoppers emerged from Degnan 's Bakery . There was even some activity at Parents League headquar-  | ters . But on the whole , it was , to Monsignor Miles 's way of thinking , a placid scene . There were , he knew , other interpretations . For Father Doyle and , if scores of telephone calls meant anything , for many parishioners , this was the facade of sin rampant and the collapse of civilization . And to Precinct 38 , this unexciting tableau represented an acute embarrassment . On the one hand , there was the right of Americans to demonstrate peaceably . On the other hand , there was an affront to every decent instinct . Duty had triumphed over personal inclination and permits had been reluctantly issued . Telephone calls poured in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The clerk on duty at the station house had no immediate answer . At that moment Father Doyle was presented with additional grounds for annoyance . A novena service had just drawn to a close . Father James appeared on the steps of St. Bernadette 's . As he prepared to descend he became aware , simultaneously , of the party at the rectory and of Mrs. Kirk . Squaring his shoulders and elevating his chin , he hurried down to the sidewalk and engaged her in cordial conversation . Father Doyle snorted . Monsignor Miles was recommending tolerance for youthful waywardness when a rakish sports car pulled up behind the VW , parking illegally . From it , there issued four persons : one young man and three young women . He wore a dirty toga , had a shorn pate and carried a bulging briefcase . They wore saris under Shetland sweaters and carried wicker baskets . The whole quartet was shod with sandals . Mrs. Kirk , who was not interested in talking to Father James , broke off to stare critically . The policeman bestirred himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Metropolitan Council for information simply gawked.  | " I have here , " shouted the young man , taking up a commanding position on the church steps , " free , to anybody interested , birth control pills !

Then , positioning himself between Grimes and the toga , he said , " Just you move on , Shorty . Do n't look for trouble . Now you , mister . I want you in your car and on your way !

"  | Alerted by the rising noise level , a small crowd was gathering . Also alerted were the nuns of St. Bernadette 's . Three of them came rushing out of school to protect their charges . It was a richly tapestried scene , full of interest . Officer Curran was rudely but effectively manhandling the swami toward his Corvette . Sisters Columba , Mary Jerome and Philomena were dispersing the smaller fry , who showed a tendency to pick up one or more of the chants . " Pig ! Pig ! Pig ! " " Oom ! Oom ! Oom ! " " Shame !

The New York City Independent subway system toppled it . Unseen beneath the ground the E-train , in its unhurried course from Chambers Street to Jamaica , debouched its Flensburg passengers and moved on . In a large group , they trudged upstairs from the bowels of the earth , to surface at the corner of Jackson Boulevard and 69th Avenue . Leading the crowd were four members of the Metropolitan Council of Concerned Laymen , ready to take their stations in the VW minibus . Also present were a reporter and a photographer from Veritas magazine , which was , as its masthead proclaimed , an uncensored look at the Church by and for modern Catholics . Toward the rear were three married priests and eight students from St. John 's Seminary , all eager to give greater Flensburg the benefit of their thinking on almost any subject .

Around him priests , nuns , policemen , flower children , reformers , and Shorty Grimes were giving tongue . Mr. Vertuno swung . For several moments thereafter events moved slowly enough so that Monsignor Miles was able to chart the everwidening spiral of violence . Officer Curran , instinctively acting to quench the flames , shoved Vertuno away from his victim and leaned forward to ascertain the damage .

The next moment her placard descended heavily on the seminarian 's shoulders . After that , all individual movements were lost . Issue had been joined . Concerned laymen , seminarians , construction workers and lady pickets all moved forward in support of colleagues . Monsignor Miles heard Father Doyle moaning at his side . Jackson Boulevard had become a kaleidoscope of changing forms and patterns , which every now and then mysteriously froze as if a movie reel had stuck at one frame . From chaos , dramatic vignettes appeared , crystallized , then melted . There was the Bhagavad Catholic girl who must have  | jumped on Shorty Grimes 's back . He was bending forward like an indulgent father giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her sari up around her hips , belabored his broad back with one fist and gave vent to cries worthy of a Valkyrie . A robust little boy had become the subject of a tug of war between a nun and a lady picket . The women were both disheveled ; the little boy , rosy with excitement , was egging them on to further displays of infantilism . Suddenly the roiling mass ejected the solitary figure of the guru . Like an arrow , he made straight for the church steps . Possibly he was seeking sanctuary . If so , it was a mistake for him to open his briefcase , plunge his hand in and bring forth a fistful of packets . Roaring disapproval , two of the Galway Tavern contingent set out in pursuit . Baying at their heels came three concerned laymen . At the top of the steps the handful of parishioners , all women over sixty , grimly took up battle formation . Beyond the crowd , the VW bus was performing a stately antic of its own . It teetered from side to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned over . Revealed behind it was the smashed window of the Parents League storefront . Finally , all vignettes were engulfed by the maelstrom . There were placards and fists . There were nuns ' habits and saris . And , from far away , there was the shrill scream of police sirens .  | American society is not without its passions . And thanks to television , everybody over the age of two knows what happens when one of them erupts . Inevitably , the man in the street has become a connoisseur of riot . Millions of people , therefore , watched the late news roundup that evening and prepared to judge Flensburg 's effort along these lines . They saw demonstrators bundled into the paddy wagon , they saw broken plate glass windows , they saw one overturned car . But , undeniably , there were many things they did not see . Where were the crash-helmeted young radicals ? Where were the first-aid stations with visiting politicians ? Where was the smoking rubble of a burntout city block ? For that matter , who was Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mrs. Kirk , fresh from jail , was interviewed in the living room of her Scarsdale home . She was as fluent as ever . " Yes , I 've been busted . And I 'm proud of it ! " she said de-12o THORNS AND SNARES 121  | fiantly . " In the present state of our society , being busted should be the aim of every enlightened citizen . " The reporter was adept at dealing with idiocy . " And do you intend to continue your activities , Mrs. Kirk ? " Mrs. Kirk was sitting on a sofa with two of her children . She encircled them with her arms as she answered . " No responsible Catholic mother can have any option . We must continueand expandour dissent until we have created a Church fit for our children ! " Fourteen-year-old Christopher Kirk looked painfully embarrassed . His father was nowhere in evidence . " That 's one hell of a rioter they 've got there , " complained one viewer . His wife was more charitable . " Now , George . They 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . " By the following day , films of the Flensburg riot had been airlifted around the world and shown from Buenos Aires to Moscow . Nowhere did they find such a rapt audience as in Vatican City . His Eminence , Cardinal Devlin , strolling in the gardens , did his best to satisfy the curiosity of his companions . " Yes , I think you could say that Flensburg is typical of the communities in the archdiocese , " he said . " More pertinently , we might ask ourselves if it is typical of communities around the world , " argued a South American cleric . " Are we about to witness a great revolution among the laity ? " " Nonsense ! " scoffed an Italian . " America is axiomatically a nation of violence . These tensions are localized . " An animated discussion ensued . Various national reactions to papal encyclicals were reviewed . " Not local , " a German summarized sadly .  | " Perhaps another Reformation ? " chirped a bouncy Frenchman . " What interesting times we live in ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had joined the group . " And what is the answer to Reformation ? " he asked rhetorically . " It is Counter-Reformation ! " " You mean in a modern context ? " Cardinal Devlin asked politely . But the Jesuit had no patience with modern contexts . " I mean that the seeds of heresy must be contained before they spread . An active and militant program is called for . The dispatch of missionaries , the use of church authority , a direct confrontation with the enemy ! " With a firm eye on the Cardinal , he continued : " There can be no problem more overriding among your flock . " His Eminence conducted a rapid mental survey of race relations , core city poverty and the shortage of priests . " As a matter of fact , " he said temperately , " we have quite a few other problems . " " Not involving the spiritual welfare of millions ! " There was scorn in every syllable . " I do n't think a Counter-Reformation would work in Queens . " Jesuits are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good ten minutes before an appointment called him away . The Frenchman apologized . " Father Amadeus is very intense , " he explained . " And I am afraid he has become out of touch while he has been away . " " Oh , has he been in mission work ? " " No , no . He took refuge in one of your American Embassies twelve years ago . He got out only last week . " Good advice was the least of their troubles at archdiocesan headquarters in New York . Close examination of the  | riot coverage had produced a profound sense of gloom and a total dearth of ideas . " This wo n't be the end of it , " Monsignor Miles said , articulating the prevailing depression . Henry Stonor indulged in a gesture of hopelessness . He prided himself on a realistic view of the limitations of public relations . " There 's nothing effective we can do . Of course , we 've issued a release deploring the entire incident . But who reads releases when they can watch a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes to the facts , " Miles said bracingly . " Mrs. Kirk and her associates came to Flensburg with the hope of sparking an incident . Let us admit immediately that she succeeded . But I do not think she has accomplished much by this success . " " She has dramatized the entire issue of birth control ! " Stonor protested . Monsignor Miles looked at him wearily . " You may not have noticed , Henry , but birth control seems to be inherently dramatic . We are not discussing a minor liturgical reform . Mrs. Kirk has not brought up an aspect of dogma that might otherwise have been overlooked . She has achieved publicity . But I do not think she will do that for long merely by staging riots . " " Think of all the other people who do ! " " Yes , yes , that is just what I mean . The others offer more entertainment value . It is unlikely that Mrs. Kirk has the wit to turn her trial into a melee where she has to be bound and gagged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Few of them are these young people that everybody is fascinated by . In a nutshell , I think that television audiences will eventually tire of watching a middle-aged woman being arrested . " This trenchant preview momentarily stumped his subordinates .  | " But , Monsignor , " Stonor finally summoned the energy to say , " it 's the meantime that we have to worry about , is n't it ? " " Exactly . " Miles nodded . " Remember , we have current preoccupations on our side . Flensburg , I am happy to say , is intrinsically uninteresting . Riots in Detroit , or in Watts , at Columbia or at Harvard , are one thing . Half-baked riots in unknown middle-class neighborhoods do not arouse the same enthusiasm . Our immediate concern is to confine Mrs. Kirk to Flensburg . There , I confidently expect , she will ultimately flicker like a candle flame and expire . " This pleasing image could not fail to produce satisfaction in most of the men sitting at the table . One face , however , became more unhappy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Father Doyle who spoke . " Keeping Mrs. Kirk in Flensburg may be easy . But have you thought of the consequences to my parish ? We already have dissension and turmoil in our midst . This will add physical violence . " Monsignor Miles knew that this was not the time to remind Father Doyle that you ca n't make an omelet without breaking a few eggs . He suggested a more positive outlook . " You 're being too pessimistic , Father . I have every confidence in the good sense of your parish . " " That , " muttered Father Doyle rebelliously , " is because you do n't know them the way I do . " Nothing could have exceeded the Monsignor 's forbearance . He knew that elderly parish priests , left in autonomous authority for decades , become rigid in outlook . " Too much good sense to descend to outright violence . Besides , your parishioners are not likely to want to copy Mrs. Kirk 's particular style , " Monsignor Miles observed . But life styles were too advanced a concept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Kirk and all  | her works were out of Flensburg , the better . In fact , the more wholesome . For a moment Miles looked thoughtfully at his fingers . The insularity of St. Bernadette 's was stronger than he had bargained for . Its priest was not only remote from the power structure of the Church , he was proving innocent of more recent phenomenasuch as suburban women and pop sociology . In these treacherous waters , a lure of some sort was necessary . " We must not lose sight of one point , " he began . " One point ! " lamented poor Father Doyle . " There seem to me to be lots . Never did I think I would live to see the day when I would have to go down to the police station to bail out my curate . " Unwittingly he had presented an image graphic enough to silence the company . Not a man present was under fortyfive . Except , of course , for Henry Stonor . And Stonor , however devout , was not a priest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was very understanding , " somebody faltered . " Understanding ? They offered to run him out of the parish for me ! And that 's a fine thing for a man like Robert O'Connell to offer to do for me . " Father Doyle was now glaring around the table . They in turn were studying him with respect . The old priest was quick to sense his sudden advantage . " And so there 's one point for me to worry about , " he said with unaccustomed irony . " I have a parishioner murdered and a family grieving . I have a parochial school being closed . I have one riot over and others to come . On top of that , my curate is either a heretic or a maniac , and I leave it to you to decide which ! " Father Doyle was neither conciliatory nor respectful . He did however convey the feelings of a man harassed beyond endurance .  | It was Monsignor Miles who was placatory . " Father , we know you have many troubles . I was trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The parish priest was openly suspicious . " That would be a fine thing , " he said warily . " With Mrs. Kirk on stage , I think that the Parents League will have no choice but to cease its activities . They are good church people , all of them . When riots break out in front of the rectory , when the convent is in danger of being stormed , they will realize that now is the time to support the Church , not attack it . " " And when Mrs. Kirk is gone ? " " By that time , St. Bernadette 's Parochial School will have been sold . " Father Doyle was outraged . " No , I wo n't go along with that , " Bob Horvath was saying as the Parents League Action Committee came to much the same conclusion as Monsignor Miles , albeit two days later . " But , Bob ! What can we do ? " Mary Foster said patiently . " You do n't mean to say that you want us to join forces with Mrs. Kirk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very clear , very blue eyes . " Only the fact that you are a lady , Mary , stops me from telling you what you can do with that Kirk woman . " Almost all of Horvath 's ideas about womanliness had been offended by Valerie Kirk 's statements , actions and attitudes . " Bob , I feel the same way you do , " Mary said sincerely , " but if we do n't join her , then we have to go on in the same old way . Sooner or later , she 'll leave Flensburg , but we 'll still be here . " " We will , but will St. Bernadette 's ? "  | Mary stared at him . Then she looked around at the others . " What do you think ? " she asked with uncharacteristic helplessness . Mary Foster was not usually at a loss for suggestions . " I think Bob 's right , " Sal said unhappily . Pat and Ruthie confined themselves to solemn nods . " I will not admit that Mrs. Kirk has made the situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spirit , " Horvath applauded . Mary smiled at him affectionately . " I 'd feel better about it if we had some concrete plan . " " That 's what we need , all right . And I say two heads are better than one . " Horvath leaned back like a man who has elaborated a complex strategy . " That 's right , " Ruthie echoed dutifully . Everybody else waited . " There are five of us here , " Sal finally ventured . " No , no . " Horvath sought words to express himself . " It stands to reason if we get all of us together , we 've got a better chance of coming up with something . We 're not supposed to do all the thinking , " he ended aggrievedly . Sal Ianello saw the light . " You mean we should call a meeting of all the Parents League ? All two hundred of them ? " Bob Horvath nodded vast approval . " Of course , I suppose we could , " Sal said dubiously . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting . " In an emergency like this , one of them might come up with something . " Mary and Ruthie provided their formal consent . Pat Ianello , however , seemed lost in thought . " Well , honey , " Sal prodded , " you 're the official member of this committee . " Everybody smiled . Formalities meant very little when a couple was as united as the lanellos.  | Pat was the only one who missed the joke . She came to herself with a start . " Oh , I agree . Let 's call the meeting . But I 'll tell you what ! Let 's have Mr. Ericson there . He seems to be a man with ideas ! "  | " I have one or two little ideas , " Willard Ericson said with satisfaction as the subway jolted into movement . Thatcher bestirred himself to courtesy . " I 'm sure you do . You would n't care to tell me what they are ? " Ericson shook his head . " I 'd rather see how this parents ' meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by ear . But you wo n't be sorry you came . " He paused to inspect his companion . " The trouble with you people in ivory towers is that you forget how the little man reacts to pressure . This trip will do you good ! " The banshee roar of their passage under the East River made reply impossible . It was just as well . Thatcher controlled his instinctive response . Why , he wondered , was the Sloan Guaranty Trust supposed to be so much further from reality than Carruthers &; Carruthers ? " I 've had a good deal of exposure to how the Parents League feels about St. Bernadette 's , " he said when the noise abated . " Oh , that ! " Ericson became didactic . " I 'm talking about something else . They know the result they wantthe con-129  | tinuation of the school . It 's strategy they should be thinking about . With riots and birth control on the scene , they have the makings of a genuine protest movement . But they lack one essential ingredient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ericson took breath to answer his own question , thereby losing his opportunity . " They need a socially relevant issue , " barked Thatcher . He had always been a quick learner . Ericson was not pleased at this interruption . " I suppose you could put it that way , " he said ungenerously . " I propose to give them the one issue around which the entire movement will cohere . " Was it possible , Thatcher asked himself , that Ericson knew Charlie Trinkam 's Catherine , too ? " Tell me , " he asked affably , " is it going to be the equality of woman ? " Ericson blinked . " I beg your pardon ? " " Never mind . " Thatcher waved it away . " Just a mistake . " Still it was a shame , he reflected . He would like to see Bob Horvath 's face . Meanwhile Ericson recovered . " I think you will be surprised at the potential for organized opposition in Flensburg . Properly directed , that is . " Thatcher was considering this statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Queens Plaza . Miss Corsa , he decided , had seen which way the wind was blowing from the beginning . And was that so surprising ? She was on home ground . He might just as well be in a foreign country . How much did he know about this section of New York ? Idly his eyes strayed across the tracks . For instance , where did the GG train go ? For all he knew , it might just as well service some outer suburb of Bucharest . " I could be surprised by almost anything in Flensburg , " he announced truthfully.  | They arrived at St. Bernadette 's a few minutes before the meeting was scheduled to open . Thatcher let Ericson go forward to join the committee while he headed for an unobtrusive seat at the side of the first row . From there he should be able to recognize any stage managing . The crowd was large and animated . There were work clothes as well as business suits ; there were pink curlers as well as lacquered coiffures . And , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committee . They sounded disturbed as they responded to Ericson 's greeting . " Evening , " Bob Horvath replied in a troubled voice . He was watching the full two hundred members of the Parents League stream in . Suddenly he pointed to a man near the water cooler . " He 's not a member , " he grunted . " We ca n't throw him out , Bob , " said Pat Ianello . " Besides ... " Besides , it rapidly became clear , there were going to be many more than two hundred people present tonight . " Christ , " muttered Horvath , " I hope we 're not going to have another riot ! " " I think , " Willard Ericson suggested , " we should be about ready to begin , do n't you , Mr. Chairman ? " He might just as well have licked his chops , Thatcher thought . Bob unhappily clambered to his feet . " I guess we cancan you hear me all right back there ? FineI guess we can begin now . " He glanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Now , the first order of business is to have the secretary read the minutes of the last meeting . Marythat is , Mrs. Foster . " There was a small flurry of handclapping . Mary Foster  | rose . In a clear , steady voice , she read an account of the last plenary meeting of the St. Bernadette 's Parents League . Thatcher noted that these preliminaries were not accompanied by the usual coughing or foot-shuffling . There was absolute silence , broken only by a general sigh when the name Frank Omara was mentioned . This obviously troubled Bob Horvath . It puzzled Mary Foster , who ended by speaking too rapidly . Little Mrs. Ianello looked as if she were trying to solve a conundrum . Only Willard Ericson was untouched . The secretary 's report was read and approved . Then Mrs. Ianello presented the treasurer 's report . It , too , was approved unanimously . Then the floor got its chance . It immediately became clear to Thatcher that Flensburg was as transformed by events as Willard Ericson . The riot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they set out to do : they had made a smashing impact on Flensburg . Not that they had won adherents to the cause of liberalized birth control laws , far less to the rapprochement between Catholicism and Zen Buddhism . What they had sparked was blood lust . The Flensburg parents did not want to riotbut they did want to act forcefully , dramatically and unambiguously . Just like everybody else . A sane , temperate program to save St. Bernadette 's Grammar School remained everybody 's avowed goal . But Thatcher identified an inchoate yearning for the exhilaration of hand-to-hand combat . Everybody deplored , at length , what had happened on Jackson Boulevard . Nobody wanted to get busted . For that matter , Flensburg did not really understand why anybody would want to get busted . But stirring events have insidious side effects . The parents surrounding Thatcher had looked on high drama . In each and every one of them , something had twitched . His neighbor spelled this out .  | " Gee , Lil , " she was saying across her husband . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? They had everybody else on TV . Harry said they were bound to . Made me promise not to give any interviews . You know Harry . " Harry himself , arms crossed , sat mute . Television cameras could have done a lot with that heavy scowl . " ... do n't want St. Bernadette 's to get involved with that woman and her dirty talk . I do n't send Lucille to St. Bernadette 's so she should turn out to be a bad girl , God forbid . " The speaker was tearfully intense . She touched a chord . There was an outburst of cheering and applause . " And them kids with the beads and the crazy clothes , " began one father . For fully seven minutes , Flensburg let itself go on the Bhagavad Catholics . Voices were raised in all corners , eager to get in a few licks on rock masses , seminarians , lay teachers and a number of other subjects . Thatcher began to feel that Ericson might have something with those ivory towers . A middle-aged man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yelling . " Sure , sure ! " he bellowed . " But where 's all this getting us ? We got to do something , do n't we ? " " Attaboy , Rico ! " " I agree one hunnert percent ! " " We just gon na sit here and take it ? " There was a low growl of approval from the men , punctuated with yips and cries from the gentler sex . " We gon na let them just push us around ? " cried an incendiary voice . Horvath looked at his tablemates , found no help , then shouted at the crowd . " Let 's all keep calm ! It 's not going to do us any good to  | get all hot under the collar ! The reason we 're meeting tonight . . . " A heckler cut in : " Yaagh ! Meetings ! What good do meetings do ? " Over a rising noise level Horvath forged on : " . . . we want to know if any of you have some ideas . We all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . with these birth control people . . . " Catcalls ! .. or that bunch of kooks with the beads ! " Worse . " So we figured on a meetingan open meeting . If you 've got any ideas to give to the committee , this is your chance . " For fifteen minutes the hall rang with vigorous description of personal philosophy and religious inclination . There was also much impugning of the motives of others , from Valerie Kirk to the Roman Catholic hierarchy ( Father Doyle excepted ) . Even Father James came in for some hard words by older members of his flock . After twenty minutes Thatcher concluded that new ideas , however you defined them , were in short supply . The whole inflammable mass was about to subside into smoldering resentment at events beyond its control . Indeed , several members of the audience were ready to throw in the sponge . " Ah , what good is all this talk ? " demanded somebody . " There 's nothing we can do . There never is . You ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Optimists protested this abysmal surrender ; cynics shrugged and accepted . " If I may , " said Willard Ericson in a snappy and cheerful voice . Thatcher saw that the moment had come . " Sure , sure , " said Bob Horvath desperately . Willard Ericson rose , appraising two hundred plus men and women , baffled and enraged . Thatcher leaned back , pre-  | pared to enjoy the performance of a first-rate lawyer . Ericson might not know much about untroubled piety , but he was a master of adversarial situations . That which should be made clear , he would make childishly obvious . That which should be concealed , he would camouflage , shroud and , if need be , sink completely . Thatcher suspected that Willard Ericson lacked the poet 's insight into the human heart . But he had spent a lot of time in court . Litigation about the price of rugs may not enlarge the soul ; it does show how human beings behave in stressful situations . For are not rug manufacturers human too ? In short , Willard Ericson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controversy , than many psychoanalysts Thatcher had met . Interpersonal relationships left him cold . Ericson knew how to win a case . He looked over his audience . They looked back hopefully . " I fully sympathize with your strong feelings about recent developments , " he said blandly . " But we must be sensible and concentrate on the main purpose of your .. . our . . . organization . That is , is it not , to save St. Bernadette 's Grammar School ? " This lukewarm formulation dampened everybody briefly . " That 's right , " murmured a few knitting women who had not been following the proceedings . Mary Foster apparently felt that Ericson deserved more support . " Yes , that 's right , " she declared . " It has occurred to me , " said Ericson modestly , " that this proposal to sell St. Bernadette 's to Unger Realty will add one more absentee landlord to a community that already has too many . " So that was the cat in the bag , thought Thatcher with appreciation . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ericson , waving his red flag as deliberately as anybody could , " I have considered  | the proposition put forth by Unger , by the Sloan , and I regret to say , by Cardinal Devlin , that this project will upgrade the total neighborhood . Leaving aside the loss of your school , I have discovered that where Flensburg property is locally owned , it is excellently maintained . . . " " You 're damned right it is ! " said a truculent voice . " We paint every other year . . . and what does it get us ? Higher taxes ! " Ericson ignored this red herring . " But where there is rundown or dilapidated propertyin short where Flensburg is in real need of upgradingthat is where you will find an absentee landlord . " " Boy , you got it in one , " said a convert . " They have n't fixed our front steps in three years . Every month I call ... " " You know that bunch of stores on Jackson Boulevard , " people reminded each other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which will also destroy a dearly beloved school , is necessary to upgrade this community is untenable , " said Ericson sternly . " What 's untenable mean ? " Thatcher 's neighbor asked . Ericson did not seem to hear the growing rumble of approval . " Now my suggestion is that this group consider mounting a protest against absentee landlords , together with a program to demand enforcement of the various city building codes . " " By God ! " Bob Horvath was becoming excited . " We could get them to look at that lousy elevator in my building . " The room now rang with denunciations of non-resident property owners . " ... no heat before eight o'clock . . " ... so I called up . I said this here refrigerator is twelve years old . . . " " ... they promised ... "  | Willard Ericson had not finished . " I think a . . . er ... public demonstration of Flensburg enthusiasm and willingness to upgrade its own community would have the happy effect of destroying whatever sympathy may have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an apartment is going to benefit the community . I think it should be made clear that Flensburg does not need the help of outsiders . " The old fox had them in the palm of his hand , Thatcher saw . Outsider has always been the all-purpose epithet . " Of course , in the meantime I shall pursue certain legal remedies to restrain this proposed sale ... " It is doubtful if anybody heard Ericson 's last words , so skillfully had he bent the situation to his needs . " That 's the way , " said a reinvigorated Bob Horvath . " Show them , show everybody that the problems here in Flensburg are our own . We can take care of them ! " Applause . Followed by further examples of evil absentee landlords . Finally : " Say , Bob , I got a suggestion ! " " You mean you got a motion ? " " That 's what we wanta motion ! " " Somebody make a motion ! " Of all people , Harry of the crossed arms rose . He glared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " All right , I 'll make this motion . I 'll make a motion that we listen to what Mr. . . . Mr. . . . " " Ericson , " said his helpmeet . Harry gave her a look . " ... to the lawyer . We show them that we do n't need outsiders coming here to upgrade Flensburg . How 's that ? " That was fine for most people . There was renewed enthusiasm . Harry sat down to the plaudits of his fellows , refolded his arms , and exuded deep self-satisfaction . There , he seemed to be saying to Thatcher , try to beat that !  | Ericson had been studying his jury . " That young man in the first row , " he suggested in an undertone to the chairman . The young man rose and cleared his throat . " Mr. Chairman . I wish to make a motion . " " Sure , sure , " said Horvath . He had lost control and he was not pretending otherwise . Self-consciously , the speaker went on : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bernadette 's Parents League to the Flensburg Community League . " " Excellent , " murmured Ericson , literally rubbing his hands together . " Because , " said the young man , warming to his theme , " we 're not fighting for St. Bernadette School alone . We 're fighting for our entire community . You might say , our way of life ! " There was an outburst . Harry 's wife nudged Harry , then Thatcher . The only thing missing was a brass band , playing " The Stars and Stripes Forever . " There ensued another twenty minutes of high emotion . Mary Foster could be heard protesting . " But Mr. Ericson ! What good will all this do us ? What is a community league going to accomplish ? " Ericson answered her only indirectly . He consulted another piece of paper . Then , leaning over , he spoke to Horvath . " Great , great ! " said Horvath ferociously . " All right , you out there . Quiet down ! Mr. Ericson is going to tell us what to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else in the hall .  | Willard Ericson 's natural instinct for timing had been honed to a fine edge by years of trial experience . Like the craftsman that he was , he brought the formal meeting to a close as the surging wave of enthusiasm crested . Excited groups milled around the large room , donning coats and hats , pledging support and assistance . The committee itself huddled over Ericson 's briefcase as he displayed one paper after another . The hall rang with self-congratulation and determination . " That 's the way to go ! " a dried-up little man , moving to Thatcher 's side , exclaimed . " The things I could tell you about my landlord ! " " You think this is a good idea ? " Thatcher asked . The man gripped his sleeve . " The only thing wrong with it is that it 's years too late . But that 's these bums for you . Make a lot of fuss about the school , they will , when they know it 's wrong to go against the Cardinal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 139  | Thatcher tried to unravel this tangled blend of approval and criticism . " Then you 're for the sale of the school ? " " The Cardinal knows best , does n't he ? And that apartment house will give us a boost , wo n't it ? " The bony head bobbed forward at every question . Thatcher was beginning to wonder how he could withdraw when deliverance appeared . " Mr. Thatcher ? Have you got a minute ? " The voice was vaguely familiar , but it took Thatcher a moment to recognize the wiry dark man . " I 'm Sal Ianello . We 've already met . " Thatcher shook hands . Of course , this was the A &P; manager who had routed Dick Unger . The clutch on his arm tightened . " Hey , are you that banker ? Listen , you 're getting the wrong idea about Flensburg from these League people . We want that apartment house ! " Ianello took action . Over intervening heads , he called to his wife : " We 're going out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet us at the cafeteria ? And tell Ericson , wo n't you ? " Then he turned to the clutcher . " Sorry , Phil . We 've got to run . " Within minutes , they were out on a rain-drenched street . As he turned up his collar , Ianello apologized . " I hope you do n't mind , Mr. Thatcher . Ericson said he 'd be about fifteen minutes more . And I could see you wanted to get rid of Kavanaugh . " Thatcher said he was delighted to be rescued . Then memory came to his aid . " Is that the Kavanaugh you were talking about at the funeral ? He seems to be a very strong supporter of Monsignor Miles . " Ianello laughed shortly as he ducked into the cafeteria on the corner . " Phil is a strong supporter of his own pocketbook . He owns that little candy store across from St. Berna-  | dette 's . When the news about the apartment house spread , he saw the chance to make a profit . He 's already had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could do better . And of course he will if the apartment house goes up . " It was clear to Thatcher . " I see . He owns his store but rents his apartment . " There was a silent nod . Sal Ianello was mulling over another problem . When he finally spoke , he had difficulty formulating his ideas . " I did n't break in on you just because of Kavanaugh . I wanted a chance to talk to you . Look , Mr. Thatcher , you 're from Wall Street . I suppose you know how these big-time lawyers operate . " He paused , uncertain how to proceed . " Is Ericson always like this ? " Thatcher tried to be helpful . He explained that he had not previously known Ericson . Then he added that even the man 's partners were surprised at his performance . This innocuous statement provided Ianello with food for thought . " So , they 're surprised , too , " he mused . " You know , I asked one of the company lawyers about him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specialist in fair trade . He 's supposed to have a reputation for practical advice . " " Yes ? " Thatcher grunted encouragingly . He could not see why this catalogue of professional achievement should be recited so glumly . " Practical advice ! " Ianello snorted . " The way he 's acting , if I went to him because I was having trouble getting deliveries from the warehouse , he 'd advise me to start a rival chain of supermarkets . " " You think his methods are too drastic ? " Sal did not answer the question . Instead he was suddenly inspired . " Ericson 's just distributed a whole bunch of proposals . I 'd like you to take a look at them . " Thatcher was not sure he wanted to supply a critical  | estimate of Ericson 's behavior . On the other hand , he had come to Flensburg to learn what was coming . Here was an unrivaled opportunity to do so . While Sal went off to the counter , Thatcher studied the document he had been handed . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lawsuits , mass protests and appeals to the legislature jostled for space . An unlikely array of possible allies was consideredfrom Mrs. Valerie Kirk through the Republican Party to the Black Panthers . Ericson might save St. Bernadette 's by these tactics , but in passing he would reduce the archdiocese to a shambles , seize political control of Flensburg , oust half the property owners and put the Mass back into Latin . " Very comprehensive , " Thatcher said , at his most noncommittal . " There are a lot of things I do n't know anything about , " Sal admitted , savagely planting two cups of coffee on the table . " But I do know one thing . You do n't get to be an expert on the fair trade laws by making like a nut ! " Thatcher reminded himself that Ianello was in the retail business . Supermarkets carried a good many fair-traded items these days . " What exactly are you afraid of ? Do you think Ericson 's turning into a raving maniac ? " " I do n't know exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cautious sip from his cup before continuing slowly : " I 'm beginning to wonder whether St. Bernadette 's is what he 's really aiming at . Once you get a couple of hundred people shoving around , going all out for something , you get a lot of little by-products . Hell , if you used that as a battle plan " he flicked the typed schedule " you 'd get some pretty big ones . Ericson could have that in mind all along . Maybe that 's why he 's so generous with his time . " Thatcher was much more interested in listening than in speaking . Pat Ianello 's arrival was a relief .  | " Just coffee , Sal , " she said as her husband rose . " Oh , and a cruller too . " Then she turned back to Thatcher . " What did you think of the meeting , Mr. Thatcher ? " she asked earnestly . Thatcher temporized . He wondered if she shared her husband 's suspicions . " It was not quite what I expected , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I ca n't figure out what to do . Mary and I will have to get together . " " That 's Mrs. Foster ? " " Yes , you see if this League is going to turn into a protest by tenants , I do n't see where Mary and I come in . It 's all right for Bob . He rents an apartment a couple of blocks away . But that 's not true for us . Mary owns her own home . In fact , I suppose she 's got two of them now that her mother 's dead . And Sal and I live on the second floor of my parents ' house . " " So you ca n't complain about absentee landlords ? " Pat was mischievous . " When we first got married , Sal would have liked them to be a little more absentee . " Thatcher did not have to be told that time had dimmed this feeling . Probably the Ianellos would n't be out this evening if it were not for captive baby-sitters . " Did you and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tray . " No , she 's going to talk to me when she breaks free from Bob and Ericson . Bob will try to persuade her to stay . " Pat wrinkled her brow in thought . " Of course , you ca n't blame him . Mary and I do most of the paperwork together . But she 's better than I am at organizing things . Bob will really be up a creek if she resigns . " " Not to mention that he 'll have to dig up the rent , " Sal remarked . He explained to Thatcher . " Frank Omara was paying for our storefront out of his own pocket . We 're still running on the rent he paid a couple of days  | before he was murdered . Mary volunteered to take over . " " I do n't even know how much it is , or who it gets paid to , " Pat confessed . " That 's another one of our absentee landlords . I suppose it ca n't cost a lot . But still the League does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Sal was becoming restive . " Well , if you change direction in midstream , you have to take the consequences . The trouble with that meeting tonight is that everyone wanted something different . Even the old-timers turned out . And they blame everything on the League . Their story is that if we just eat crow and apologize to the Cathedral , everything will be normal again . We 've got some hotheads of our own . They claim that the old-timers murdered Frank and are responsible for everythingfrom bringing in Mrs. Kirk to starting a riot . Then we 've got a simple-minded bunch who want to lynch Monsignor Miles because he started the trouble by trying to sell St. Bernadette 's . And , " he concluded , " if we have much more of this , I 'm going to start a movement to lynch Willard Ericson . " His wife 's response was calm . " Everybody 's always wanted different things , Sal . I mean , in the long run . We managed to sew it all together because we all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her husband was growing philosophical . " It 's amazing how far you can go together without being bothered by wanting different things , is n't it ? " He appealed to Thatcher . " But this may be the end of the line . " " You have put your finger on most popular movements , " Thatcher said cautiously . " But would you explain how this applies to Flensburg ? " " It 's the Parents League I 'm talking about , " Sal amplified . " I suppose , when you come right down to it , Bob Horvath represents the biggest group . They 're the ones who remember a world of nice little boys and girls going to parochial school and coming home to big , respectable  | families . They want to keep things that way . They forget that was a different world . And , for that matter , they 've forgotten a lot of the nastiness in that worldlike the kids who went wrong and the fathers who were drunks and wifebeaters . " Pat interrupted . " The big thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because they were poor together . And the one thing no one has ever wanted to be is poor . " Thatcher approved . Mrs. Ianello seemed capable of recognizing economic fundamentals that escaped most practicing sociologists . Sal ignored them both . " Then there are the people like Pat and me . We know we ca n't have nineteen-thirty-five , and we would n't have it as a gift ! We 're worried about the public schools , we 're scared of our kids getting mixed up with drugs and violence . So in a couple of years we 'll move to the suburbs . Probably the drugs and the violence will , too . " Thatcher saw an inconsistency . " Then your Parents League does seem to be representative , " he said . " No , " Pat hastened to explain . " What Sal meant is that the Parents League never would have gotten off the ground if it had been left to us . The ones who really got us airborne were Frank Omara and Mary Foster . We did n't know what to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things . But Frank was the biggest funeral director in Flensburg . He knew almost everybody , he knew about business and how much money the Cardinal would make from selling the school . He worked up the figures about how much it cost to run the school . And he could explain it so that we all could understand . " " Yes , I can see the value of a man like that . " Thatcher could also see that a man like that might have been a deterrent to Willard Ericson 's planning .  | " And Mary Foster worked in perfectly . She 's active in every woman 's group we 've got . And she ran for Borough Council last election , you know . She lost , but just about everybody got to know her . And , of course , she knows all about things like local school boards and how to organize a block . It was the two of them who got the rest of us together . But the funny part is that they wanted different things . It 's hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a loss for words . Sal tried to help . " Frank believed in ideas . For instance , he wanted something called Catholic education . ' Myself , " Sal grinned provocatively at his wife , " I think that usually turns out to be Irish education , but whatever it is , he believed in it . Then , even if he was smart enough to soft-pedal it , he also wanted to take a stand for lay participation in the Church . Particularly in running the parish . He was really shocked when the archdiocese tried to railroad the sale of St. Bernadette 's . You could almost say he came out like a crusader . " Thatcher tried to recall his one encounter with Francis Omara . Yes , it was possible to see the dead man as a crusadera controlled and knowledgeable crusader . " And Mrs. Foster ? " he asked . It was Pat who spoke with the authority of an expert . " Mary 's a woman . She does n't go in for the high flights . But she has a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she sticks to that , even when it 's not to her advantage . Look at the way she behaved tonight . She does n't like this campaign about absentee landlords . She says it will take attention away from St. Bernadette 's . And I think she 's right . " Pat was very sober . " And you have to admire her . She could make an election issue out of these landlords . Sometimes I think she 's too uncompromising . She did n't even want Sal and me to look at Mr. Unger 's project over on Staten Island . I know Mr. Unger is n't going to come over  | to our side , but I do n't think it does any harm to talk to him . " " I do n't think it did , " Thatcher agreed . " But I do n't want you to think Mary is n't a realist . She 's ready to fight for St. Bernadette 's . I heard her laying it on the line to Father James when he criticized her for starting the Parents League @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the name . " He has been a consistent opponent of the Parents League , has n't he ? " Pat smiled broadly . " He 's a consistent critic of everybody . He thinks he 's a liberal , but he wants to ram through his ideas like an old-fashioned parish priest . He tried to lecture me about Christian marriage . " " Well , if they do away with celibacy and he gets himself a wife , " Sal said lazily , " that 's the last we 'll hear about that . " Pat was immediately lost in speculation . Who had the potential , she asked , to make the wife that Father James deserved ? " There 's Sharon Farrell , " she answered happily . " That girl is going to turn into a real henpecker , I can see it coming . " The conversation might well have protracted itself beyond Thatcher 's competence had it not been for the arrival of Mary Foster . She got right down to business . " Things are n't as bad as you think , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raincoat . " But someone is going to have to talk sense to them sooner or later . " She paused to look at Thatcher thoughtfully . " I do n't suppose you . . . ? " Thatcher hastily declared himself not responsible for Willard Ericson . " I did n't really think so , " Mary sighed . " I suppose it 's up to us . Bob will listen to reason once he 's cooled down . He 'll see this wo n't do any good . And , Mr. Thatcher , I do realize that you 've already done a lot for us . If nobody else has  | thanked you for taking enough interest to come out here tonight , I 'd like to . " " I enjoyed it , " said Thatcher . Surprisingly , this was so . " Mr. Ericson asked me to tell you that he 's finished . He 's waiting for you across the street . " Her teeth glinted in a sudden smile . " I guess he did n't think he 'd be very popular over here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It would , Thatcher reflected , take someone made of solid oak not to know . Sal Ianello followed him to the door . " You wo n't forget what I said about Ericson , will you ? " he said , reverting to their earlier conversation . " No , " Thatcher promised . But Ianello had more to say . " I 'd give a lot to know what Frank Omara said in his last talk with Monsignor Miles , would n't you ? " Thatcher was startled . Had the trend of Ianello 's suspicions changed ? " Why ? " he asked baldly . Sal was almost too ingenuous . " Frank was upset during that last meeting . He was n't cheerful the way he usually was . He had something on his mind all right . And if that was why he was murdered , it was probably still on his mind the next evening . Monsignor Miles was the logical person for him to talk to . And I ca n't help remembering one thing . I can still hear what Frank said at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exploit St. Bernadette 's . I think he meant someone was trying to make money out of it , do n't you ? " As he stepped over the flooded gutter , Thatcher realized how shrewdly Ianello had made his last point . Very few bankers could have failed to agree with him .  | The events of the following Thursday were due almost entirely to an unfortunate mischance . The owner of Bob Horvath 's building , Mr. Sirius Meeks , himself resided in an apartment on United Nations Plaza . This fact had not been previously known in Flensburg . There , the owner was known as Blue Hill Realty , Incorporated , and emerged in the form of an impersonal rent collector . But once Willard Ericson turned his mind to the problem of absentee landlords , it was the work of minutes to tear aside the veil of corporate anonymity . It did not take much longer to rouse local enthusiasm for a demonstration in Mr. Meeks 's backyard . Indeed , the magnitude of the response was surprising . People who were too young to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and people who were already sending children to public school , all flocked to the St. Bernadette 's Parents League in its new guise . The membership of the Action Committee was still unchanged , in spite of Pat lanello 's reluctance . 149  | " Do n't you think we should resign , Mary ? " she had asked . " No matter what Bob says , you did n't start the League to take on absentee landlords . " " No , I do n't think we should , " Mary had replied vigorously . " Somebody has to stay here and fight for St. Bernadette 's . I do n't exactly know how . But if that Ericson man can produce one miracle , maybe he can come up with another one . " " I do n't think he 's very interested in St. Bernadette 's now , " Pat replied crossly . " The only one who knows what that old goat is interested in is ' Willard Ericson himself ! " And so , with mixed emotions , the Action Committee determined to march @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York subway systemoften maligned , often threatened , but somehow still functioningthree hundred protesters were able to make the trip from Flensburg and to parade into United Nations Plaza . Their arrival astonished the New York City police . Let any situation become repetitive enough and those in charge become victims of a single fixed idea . Thus , for over eighteen months , the same orders had been issued to the men guarding the United Nations . Whatever else happens , keep a clear space of fifty yards between the Jewish pickets and the Arab pickets ! Splendid as this strategy was , it made no allowance for the advent of a third faction . " Who the hell are they ? " asked one startled patrolman . " They 've got signs , " his partner observed . The signs were not designed to be helpful . They were the result of individual zeal . CATHOLIC CHURCHMEN UNITE ! DOWN WITH MEEKS ! ST . BERNADETTE 'S FOR BETTER LIVING  | FRANCIS OMARA DID NOT DIE IN VAIN ! FLENSBURG MARCHES FORWARD " Who 's Meeks ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Maybe he was killed in the Sinai , " the first one said dubiously . It did not sound likely , even to his own ears . But his partner was already busy at the two-way radio . " Tell the commissioner the Catholics have come ! " he blurted out . At Headquarters there was justifiable bewilderment . " Do you mean that now we want Jerusalem ? " exclaimed a deputy commissioner . The commissioner 's onerous responsibilities encouraged brutal realism . " If we do , " he rejoined , " this is a bad time to try and get it . " Enlightenment might never have dawned if the police had been left to talk exclusively with each other . But other voices were soon raised . The belligerents already entrenched in United Nations Plaza were not men to suffer in silence . First there was loud disbelief . Then there was polyglot grievance at trespass . Finally , there was the first common ground in many a year . Jew and Arab alike started a nasty seepage toward the newcomers . The police intervened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truce . General clarification prevailed . " Too much clarification , if you ask me , sir , " announced the lieutenant who had taken over communications . " The Jews and the Arabs say they have rotten landlords , too . In fact , one of the Jordanians was telling me you would n't believe the housing conditions over in Crown Heights . " " Forget Crown Heights ! " barked the radio . " What I want to know is whether everything is peaceful in the Plaza . " " Oh , everybody 's getting along like a house afire . But , sir ,  | what do you want me to do about permits for this new bunch ? " " So long as they 're not giving any trouble , forget about permits . We 've got important things to worry about . " Possibly Headquarters misread the situation . Possibly , too , Headquarters was not disposed to lavish manpower on slum landlords living in penthouses . In either case , Mr. Sirius Meeks was not swaddled with police protection . Subsequent developments came as no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright and bitterly cold day . Gusts from the East River ripped through the open Plaza with knifeedged velocity . The old pros were outfitted for Arctic conditions . As suffering threatened the Flensburg contingent , Jews and Arabs rallied around with aids to survival . First came the offer of earmuffs and wool gloves for the stricken . Then advice about handling large placards so they did not turn into mighty wind-filled mainsails . Finally , eleven o'clock signaled an elaborate coffee break . This was not the end of the contest . Delicacy vied with delicacy . " What do they call this stuff with the sesame seeds ? " Bob Horvath asked as he nuzzled an oily handful . Pat Ianello was too busy to answer . She was trying to extract the recipe for her chopped liver sandwich from a motherly woman . And amidst apricot paste and cold ffanken , everyone swapped atrocity stories about landlords . The accents differed , the details were the sameelevators out of service for months , inadequate heat , rampant vermin . Not surprisingly , when replacements arrived to picket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to support their new-found friends . " Sooner or later , " the lieutenant predicted , " some reporter is going to realize this is a story . "  | He was strolling through the assorted groups like a proud kindergarten teacher approving the behavior of his charges . Everything , he reported hourly , was going just fine . If the lieutenant had paused to think , he would have recalled that there is one group even more sensitive to the publicity value of current events than the press . That group is composed of men who run for elective office . And United Nations Plaza is home to quite a large number of them . As word of the presence of anti-Meeks forces percolated into the byways of Manhattan , the phone calls started . " Listen , Amanda , this is serious , " said young Carlton Briggs ; " I do n't know when I 'll be home . " Amanda dropped the chain of turquoise beads she had been considering to give the phone her undivided attention . " What do you mean , you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgotten that we have over a hundred guests arriving at five o'clock ? " " I know that . But I ca n't come back as long as those pickets are in front of the building . Are they still there ? " Mr. Briggs sounded hysterical . Amanda 's interests in life were restricted , but they included society page coverage of her parties . She drifted to the window , looked out dutifully , and reported back . " They 're still there , honey , but what do they have to do with us ? I passed them this morning . They 're some kind of Catholic group . " " Amanda , they 're picketing a slum landlord who lives in our building . And I 'm running for city council ! I ca n't afford to get involved ! " " Carlton , I 'm not asking you to get involved , " Amanda said with heavy patience ; " I 'm just asking you to come home . How can I have a party without you ? " " What if somebody stops me ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? What if he asks me how I like having  | a slum landlord for a neighbor ? I 'm running on the Democratic ticket , " young Briggs reminded his wife , who tended to forget . " That 's hard enough when you 're rich . " Unfortunately Amanda 's vagrant attention had been caught by one phrase . " Well , Carlton , why do we have a slum landlord for a neighbor ? " " Because he can afford to live at UN Plaza , " her husband snarled . " Now , honey , I want you to promise me you 'll stay inside . I do n't want them catching you , either . With luck , nobody will realize we live there . " The chief occupation of Amanda Briggs 's life was letting people know where she lived . She decided that , for some reason , this was turning into one of those occasions on which men are difficult . " No , Carlton , " she said sweetly , " I wo n't go out . I 'll be too busy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I always said we should live in the Dakota ! " Every politician in the building made a call virtually identical to this one . At the same time , Police Headquarters went momentarily insane when its information retrieval system reported that Mr. Sirius Meeks had Anglicized his name some thirty years ago upon emigrating from Beirut . " Do n't let anyone know ! " they ordered the lieutenant . Father James was also making telephone calls . He had been detailed to join the Flensburg protest by Father Doyle out of a variety of motives . First , of course , anything that got Father James out of Queens and simultaneously slaked his thirst for social movements was a good thing . Second , Monsignor Miles remarks about confining the conflagration to Flensburg had rankled at the time and they still rankled . When Father James 's third call reported that television crews had finally arrived , a small thin smile spread over Father Doyle 's face . In the midst of all this calling , sooner or later a new num-  | ber was going to occur to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had had in mind all along . At approximately four-thirty , the calls to husbands , wives , policemen and ecclesiastical superiors stopped . Everyone started calling Mr. Sirius Meeks . " My own neighbors turning against me ! " he lamented . His wife , who had been running the blockade while he skulked inside , said that it was becoming a major inconvenience for the whole building . " They 're not used to inconveniences , " she pointed out . " And how did they make their money ? " Mr. Meeks inquired sardonically over the shrilling of the telephone bell . " If the truth were known , it Oh , never mind , I 'll get it . " This time it was some unknown Catholic priest . " He wanted to talk to me about my responsibilities to his flock ! " Mr. Meeks thundered . " If he ca n't talk to you , he 'll talk to television , " said Mrs. Meeks . She did not know how right she was . Father James did talk to television . So did Bob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detention kept Phil Kavanaugh from advancing on the microphones . " Think of the terrible impression he 'd make , " Pat Ianello gasped in the ensuing scuffle . Those who did speak made a splendid impression . The commissioner himself said so when he finally sped to the scene . " Everybody is using a lot of restraint , " he said , ignoring a spirited debate occurring just out of camera range . He shivered in the icy blast from the East River . " It 's heartwarming to see New Yorkers conducting an orderly protest like this . I 'm proud of them , and I 'm proud of the police . It 's been a long hard day for all of us , but it 's a day we can all be . . . urn . . . proud of . " He triggered an orgy of self-congratulation . Mr. Richard  | J. Dumbleby , vice president of CBS and manager of station WCBS entitled his editorial " The Great People of a Great City . " " .. . factionalism , group pitted against group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we see at United Nations Plaza today ? We saw Jews and Arabs joining their Catholic brethren , submerging differences for the common good . Perhaps we can all learn a lesson from the men and women of Flensburgthe lesson that there is at least as much binding us together as dividing us ... " Every editor , columnist , minister and politician in the city recognized a Heaven-sent text . Here , in a world of tragedy and anguish , there is goodness , there is hope , there is brotherhood . Even in New York . It was a terrible week for Mr. Sirius Meeks .  | The Police Commissioner and the networks might glow with tempered approval . Bob Horvath was frankly jubilant . " Did you see what Channel Eleven called us ? " he asked happily . " A community fighting to save itself ! How about that ? " Horvath was leading a victory celebration . The general intoxication of seeing Flensburg right up there with Washington , Saigon , and Peking had filled headquarters to overflowing . The party was in full swing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " My son in Omahahe called up last night . They showed us on TV out there . Would you believe it ? " But new enthusiasms had not submerged old memories . " We sure showed them , huh , Bob ? " demanded a follower . " Frank would have been proud of us . " Horvath put down his can of beer and spoke earnestly : " We 're going to do a lot more for Frank 's memory . If it was n't for him , we would n't be here today . " He grew almost evangelical . " We have n't begun to fight yet . Meeks is only 157  | the start . They wo n't recognize Flensburg once we 're through . We 'll go after every single one of those stinking landlords . " There was a roar of applause over lifted beer cans . " Now we 've got the clout , we 'll use it . We 're not gon na let anybody push us around anymore ! " Ruthie nearly burst with pride . She had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a new man out of Bob ... . At the Chancery , Henry Stonor was not jubilant . He was , however , cautiously optimistic . After prolonged thought , he had concluded that United Nations Plaza would promote , not retard , Church interests . His reasoning was persuasive . " In the first place , the whole demonstration by these Flensburg parents had nothing to do with religious matters . They were protesting absentee landlords ... " A casual question from Father Livingston reinforced Henry 's conviction . " No . Mr. Meeks is secular , if anything ever was . Then , too , this entire uproar happened a long way from St. Bernadette 's . The television crews were in the Plaza . The cameras showed pickets at the United Nations . Reporters were interviewing Manhattan politicians . Anybody in public relations will tell you that the school has become a dead issue . " " But . .. " " Finally , " Henry said triumphantly , " remember how peaceful and orderly the protest was . There was nothing to make a scandal for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father Livingston was silent . After the Bhagavad Catholics , the Chancery was ready to be grateful for almost anything . " As we see it , " Henry summarized , already visualizing the words in typeset , " this new program of the Parents  | League has improved the outlook for a rational , correct solution to the vexed problem of selling St. Bernadette 's . " There was no argument from Father Livingston . Henry rose , squared his slight shoulders , and prepared to put his case before Monsignor Miles . For once , he thought without arrogance , there were no flaws in his logic . Monsignor Miles must agree that there was no impediment to optimism . It is always harder to convert a man to pessimism than to optimism . Mary Foster was beginning to fear that the task might be beyond her powers . " Mr. Ericson , " she insisted , " I still do n't see where all this is going to lead . " In his hour of triumph , Willard Ericson could afford to be generous . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Foster . We have already made considerable progress . The television coverage alone has been an extraordinary asset . Of course , we were fortunate to become a human interest story . Those pickets at the United Nations . . . " Mary was less patient with Ericson 's prolixity than she had been . " I know about the television coverage , " she broke in without apology . " I know everybody is patting us on the back . That 's not what I mean by getting somewhere . People in Flensburg are interested in two things . Most of us want to save St. Bernadette 's . Some of us want landlord cornplaints taken care of . " Ericson could interrupt , too . He looked at her over his glasses . " You are not yourself a tenant , I understand ? " he asked dispassionately . Color was beginning to flush Mary 's cheeks . " No , I 'm not ! Everybody knows that . But I can still understand people 's complaints about heating and hot  | water . I am willing to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them is to enforce the building code , not make fools of ourselves in UN Plaza ! I admit we 've given Mr. Meeks a bad time . But that is n't the same as getting heat and hot water ! " Ericson had deliberately roused Mary ; now he used her response . " I am afraid " he shook his head sadly " that you are exaggerating . Of course Mr. Horvath and the tenants want a practical solution for their difficulties . Just as you want to save the school . But you agreed to ask for an injunction against the Unger sale , did n't you ? " " Because it would stop the sale , that 's why ! " she snapped . " No , Mrs. Foster , I must correct you . The suit was filed to bring pressure on the archdiocese . And , ultimately , that is precisely what these tenant protests will do as well . If sufficient public sympathy is roused for Flensburg , the archdiocese will be in danger of being confused with slum landlords . " Mary sighed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " if Monsignor Miles sees things that way . " " Let us hope not , Mrs. Foster . " Ericson smiled diabolically . " Let us hope he does not see it until too late . " For once , Father Doyle and Father James were in accord on a controversial issue . United Nations Plaza , they agreed , was a blessing . That , unfortunately , was the beginning and the end of harmony . From there they proceeded rapidly in opposite directions . " One thing I 'll say , " said Father Doyle mellowly , allowing himself an after-dinner cigar . " We have a united parish here in Flensburg once again . These have always been good people and faithful ones . I 've told the Cathedral that , time  | and time again . As for carryings-on over in Manhattan ... " He waved them away in a cloud of smoke . Father James , who admired asceticism , had quivered at the cigar . Now he quivered further . This was not lost on his superior . " I saw you on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't be need for much more of that , will there ? " He spoke with avuncular affection . United Nations Plaza was a blessing , Father Doyle had said , and he meant it . He did not intend to throw it away . " Now , with our people busying themselves elsewhere , " he said , inspecting his ash narrowly , " I think we can all go back to what we were . If Robert Horvath and his friends wish to bedevil their landlordswell , I say more power to them ! We here at St. Bernadette 's can take up our priestly dutiesand forget these bad times . " Father James was passionate . " Can we forget about murder ? " With an effort , Father Doyle kept his temper . " No , my boy , we can not forget murder or any other mortal sin . But we remember them in the sanctuary and the confessional . " Father James , too , had made several good resolutions . " Father Doyle , " he said , " we can not lock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must involve itself in the concerns of our parishioners . United Nations Plaza may be in Manhattanbut it is vital to Flensburg . " Father Doyle 's thickened fingers began a slow tattoo on the polished dining-room table . " Without a social conscience , " Father James continued beseechingly , " the Church will perish . " Father Doyle eyed him . " Now understand me , Father ! I meant what I said . There is to be no more of this nonsense from you . Discharge your obligations . You have many . Visit the sick , comfort the weary , guide the young ! "  | The mulish cast of Father James 's jaw goaded him further : " And stay off television ! " Father James took a deep breath . " Father , much as I respect and love you , I must question your decision . Flensburg is at the center of one of the most dramatic confrontations of our time . We have it in our power to prove that the Church can help Catholics in their daily life . That we are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the week . The Flensburg Community League " " STOP ! " It was the familiar voice of thunder . " I will hear no more . The Flensburg Community League ! Father James , community leagues have no need of priests ! And priests have no need of community leagues ! Now " he aimed his cigar like a pistol " now let there be an end to this . Let usfor God 's sakehave peace ! "  | After that historic assault on the domestic comfort of Sirius Meeks , John Putnam Thatcher read one editorial , watched one television program , and received , at second hand , the views of Charlie Trinkam 's Catherine . It was enough , he felt , to make him master of the situation . Recalling Willard Ericson 's give-'em-hell tactics and Sal Ianello 's growing distrust , he knew that elation , relief , and misgiving must be among the emotions provoked by this latest antic of Flensburg 's embattled citizenry . It never occurred to him thatin one quarter , at least the foray into United Nations Plaza was being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two men were seated across his desk did he realize that he was in danger of becoming an expert witness . The police opened the interview disarmingly . " I guess you did n't expect to see us back here , Mr. Thatcher . " Thatcher replied that as long as Francis Omara 's murder remained unsolved , he welcomed signs of police activity . What could he do for them ? 163  | " We 're still interested in that meeting the day before the murder . " They took him through his only encounter with Omara . Then they went a step further and asked for details about the birth of the tenants ' crusade . Finally the clincher came . " It 's like this , Mr. Thatcher . Nobody really doubts that Omara was killed because he was heading the Parents League . But , if that 's true , then you 'd expect his death to make some difference to the League . Otherwise , why bother to kill him ? " Thatcher was beginning to see where this road led . " At the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were people who thought the League might stop obstructing the sale of St. Bernadette 's with Omara gone . " This neutral trial balloon was instantly shot down . " The committee did n't stop . " For the lieutenant , facts were facts . " From what I hear , the League was never in any doubt about going on . No , that was n't the change the murderer hoped for . At headquarters , we 've been waiting . And look what 's happened ! As soon as the funeral is decently over , as soon as that birth control riot throws up a smoke screen , the League turns in its tracks , forgets all about the school , and goes chasing off after absentee landlords . Do you think that would have happened if Francis Omara was still running the show ? " Thatcher made all the normal protestations . He had met Omara only once . The surviving members of the Committee were virtual strangers . " But your impressions , Mr. Thatcher ? " The police wanted an answer and , unfortunately , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Mrs. Foster together could run the League the way they wanted , " Thatcher said honestly .  | " And now ? " Thatcher could only report that Mrs. Foster did not seem happy with the new look , but her influence was not what it had been . " I think there was some question of Mrs. Foster and Mrs. Ianello resigning . " The detectives were settling down . " The way we see it , " said the elder cozily , " this tenant protest was railroaded through by Ericson . But Horvath was right there , ready to jump on the bandwagon . He could have set the whole thing up beforehand . He 's the chairman , he 's the one who 's talking to the lawyer . " Involuntarily Thatcher remembered Horvath 's descent on the Sloan . He had been fresh from a conference with Willard Ericson . And , in his own way , he had warned Thatcher that the Parents League might be setting a new course . Had he been referring to a plot already laid ? Thatcher was happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenants ' crusade . On their subway ride to Flensburg , Ericson had promised to spring a new issue . He had not elaborated further . " You 're a banker , Mr. Thatcher , " the lieutenant said incontestably . " How does it look to you ? Omara claims someone is trying to use the League . He 's killed the next day . Then , by God , the League is used to attack property owners . The attacks wo n't stop , you know . Horvath wants to go after all the absentee landlords . Would it surprise the hell out of you if a lot of owners decided to unload ? " As a banker , Thatcher had to agree that there was something in what the lieutenant said . " I thought you 'd see it that way . " The detectives looked at each other . They were not congratulating themselves . They were preparing the next step . " We 've told Meeks we want to know about the first offer he gets . But that may take time . We 'd like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his duty . He reminded his visitors that Francis Omara had been a troubled man when he spoke with Monsignor Miles , only hours before his murder . " If anyone can provide a shortcut , it will be the Monsignor . " The detective nodded quietly . " Good . I was hoping you 'd say that . You and Monsignor Miles are the real outsiders in this deal . If we get a break , it 's probably going to come from one of you two . " The lieutenant rose . " Our next stop is the Cathedral . But I hope you 'll go on thinking about this . You might remember something . " " I shall certainly do my best , " Thatcher promised . But no one was more surprised than he an hour later . He was dictating a letter . " . .. do not foresee any substantial decline in our prime rate of interest . In spite of the action of the Worcester County Bank . . . " The silence became too protracted for Miss Corsa . " Mr. Thatcher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What ? . . . Oh , I beg your pardon , Miss Corsa . But I have just remembered something that Ianello mentioned . That man Kavanaugh received an offer for his candy store . It would be interesting to know when . " There was yet another reaction to United Nations Plaza that would come as a surprise to John Thatcher . It began with a telephone call from an expensive hideaway in the Caribbean . " Dick ? Is that you , Dick ? " the voice asked irascibly . " I 'll have Mr. Unger on the line in a moment , " trilled the switchboard operator . Dick Unger , arriving posthaste from the men 's room , picked up the receiver in time to overhear a familiar aside . " I do n't know what the hell 's wrong with that boy , Doris .  | He ca n't handle clients , he ca n't handle the press , and now he 's not even there to answer the phone ! " " Hullo , Dad , " said Dick Unger with an automatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there you are ! " It was an accusation . " I was just down the hall . " Unger senior snorted . " I wish you 'd stop wasting time and do something about this Flensburg mess ! " " Do what ? " Dick bleated . " Is it my fault that things have turned out this way ? " " You do n't seem to be helping any . What are you planning to do ? Just give up , after we 've gone this far ? " " Dad , I do n't think you realize what we 've got on our hands . This is turning into a real catastrophe . " " You know , " his father told him with sinister calm , " we get the papers down here . " " I know you do ! " As far as Dick was concerned , this was no advantage . " Did you read about that demonstration in UN Plaza ? What do you expect me to do ? Break it up with wrecking balls ? " He could now be heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment arrived during every Unger family call . " Listen , pinhead , do n't ask me what I 've read ! I 'm asking you what Unger Realty is going to say . " " What can we say ? " Dick growled . " Christ ! What have I done to deserve this ? " Unger senior asked passionately . " But , Dad " it was almost a howl " the demonstrators want to keep the community unchangedexcept for fixing things up . We want to tear down their school and build an apartment house . Logically we ca n't be on the same side . So what can we say ? " There was a long silence . When Unger next spoke , he was beholding a natural wonder . If  | " Logic I get ! Do I need logic ? Listen , those guys in the Plaza with signsthey 're against slum housing . Right ? Well , for Crissake ! Are we for slum housing ? Have you ever noticed the kind of building Unger Realty puts up ? " Dick had screwed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook his head , as the case required . " All right , Dad , all right , " he muttered . " We 're against slum housing . " " And what was their other big point ? Oh , yeahthey 're opposed to outside interference . Well , you call in the reporters and you make a big statement . Unger Realty is joining the parade . We 're against slum housing and outside interference , too ! " " But , Dad ! " Dick summoned energy for one last protest . " By outside interference they mean us . " " Well , " his father retorted combustively , " by outside interference , I mean the government . But you do n't have to tell them that , do you ? " Resistance crumbled . " Okay , okay . I 'll do it today . " " And make it strong while you 're at it ! That 's allwhat , Doris ? Oh , your mother wants to talk to you . " Mrs. Unger should have been an improvement . Unfortunately she wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughts into a disastrous preview of the future . Dick Unger could see himself , in a few short years , sandwiched between two generations , both critical and , on occasion , openly hostile . However , he had work to do . " Lily , " he told the intercom , after speeding his parents back to the beach , " you 'd better come in . I 've got a press release to dictate ... " Thus , within twenty-four hours , an essentially vacuous statement about Flensburg became available to the reading public . This , in turn , sparked competition .  | " Good God ! " said a man on the third floor of the Sloan Guaranty Trust . " Look at this ! We ca n't afford to be the only ones who are n't supporting the Parents League . We 've got to say something . . . " Soon , another press release had been composed . Not surprisingly , this one emphasized the Sloan 's distaste for substandard housing , absentee landlords and defective plumbing . The Sloan , it proclaimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American cornmunityto improve the quality of life . Of necessity , press releases from banks can not deal exclusively with moral platitudes . Frequently a number must be mentioned . For this reason , the Sloan Public Relations Department was required to secure approval from a responsible officer for its creations . As the third floor saw this , it was the eternal conflict between Art and Mammon . " I thought , Thatcher , that you would be interested in seeing our release on the Unger-St . Bernadette 's situation . " The PR Director was impersonating a man who just happened to be passing when struck by this idea . " Thank you . " Thatcher never insisted on ramming unpalatable facts down subordinate throats without necessity . He read with interest that the Sloan , inspired by the highest civic ideals , was holding in abeyance any decision on the Unger mortgage funds until the situation had clarified to the satisfaction of local residents . Renshaw was visibly pained as Thatcher reached for a pencil . " We checked with your secretary about the Bank 's policy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , " Thatcher said cheerfully . " Just a few minor changes . I 'm afraid we 'll have to take out anything that suggests a specific period of time . And I do n't like this reference to the satisfaction of local residents . Some of them are going to be dissatisfied no matter what  | happens . We 'd better make that until the situation with respect to local residents has been clarified . " Renshaw knew better than to criticize Thatcher 's prose . He did , however , feel he had an important contribution to make . " I thought a time period , in general terms at least , would be desirable . There is much interest in the financial community about how long these funds will be tied up . " He caught the frown on Thatcher 's face and explained further . " That 's because money is tight now . " For the first time Thatcher looked up and closely examined the man across the desk . He disliked dealing with the Public Relations Department and avoided doing so whenever possible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapid turnover in the department , he rarely saw the same PR man twice . Why , then , he wondered , was he afflicted with this sense of aid vu ? Ah ! Suddenly he remembered . It was from that very same chair , a scant six months ago , that Renshaw 's predecessor had carefully explained to him that when interest rates go up , the price of bonds goes down . Thatcher did not object to the Sloan 's educating the PR men caught in its revolving doors . If only they did not all become so generous with their newly acquired knowledge . " There , " he said , laying down his pencil , " that will do . " By rights , the paragraph should have appeared in modest obscurity on the financial page . But the New York papers , still enamored of the Arab-Israeli Entente , were giving its consequences inflated coverage . The Sloan paragraph , much expanded , appeared on front pages . Depending on editorial policy , it was heralded as proof of private industry 's sensitivity to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power of the people to seize the initiative and bend the Establishment to its will . Neither interpretation impressed Thatcher . But as he  | read the stories , he was satisfied . Thanks to his modifications , the Sloan 's statement was entirely meaningless . " Now that , " he said to himself , " ca n't do any harm ! " Rarely had he been so mistaken .  | It took very little time for the Sloan 's bromides about better housing to drive someone to unexpected lengths . Thatcher 's first intimation of impending tumult came with his arrival in the office next morning . Miss Corsa , in the outer room , was staring at a letter in some perplexity . In itself , this was bad . Miss Corsa did not regard it as one of her duties to be perturbed by the contents of the mail . Her job was to separate the urgent from the routine , to supply any files or backup material required for an answer , and , finally , to nag Mr. Thatcher into taking care of tiresome letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correspondence brought bad news , if it called for agonizing decisions , if it made unreasonable demands on the Sloan Guaranty Trustwell , senior vice presidents are paid substantial salaries to cope with that kind of problem . But worse was to come . Miss Corsa had raised her eyes and was considering him appraisingly . One finger hovered briefly over the telephone dial . Then she changed her mind . " Perhaps , " she said in a very slow and careful voice , " perhaps you had better see this , Mr. Thatcher . "  | Simmering , he stretched out a hand . John Thatcher knew perfectly well that there were many things his secretary did not tell him . She did not regard him as a suitable confidant for her gleanings from the Sloan grapevine . And who could say she was wrong ? But when it came to censoring his correspondence , she was going too far . Thatcher had half formed a denunciation when his peripheral vision stopped him cold . He was not holding the customary typed business communication . He was holding a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been pasted to form a message . It was short . DOWN WITH ALL ENEMIES OF ST . BERNADETTE 'S ! A BOMB WILL GO OFF IN THIS BUILDING TODAY . Wordlessly , Thatcher turned to the envelope now being extended to him . Primitive printing said simply : JOHN THATCHER SIXTH FLOOR At last he looked up and met Miss Corsa 's eyes . Matching her own control , he said gravely , " Very interesting . " Then he broke off and shook his head irately . No , this would not do ! He was allowing himself to be mesmerized by Miss Corsa . Left to their own devices , the two of them could continue demonstrating their immunity to panic until the building blew up . " It is not interesting ! " he bellowed . " It is outrageous ! " Then , for good measure , he slammed his fist on her desk . A woman who is not stampeded by a time bomb is not going to be impressed by a show of force . " What would you like me to do ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the police ! " he thundered , stalking into his own office .  | But once he was connected with Centre Street , he was curiously embarrassed . Melodrama had never been his forte . " New York City Police Headquarters , " a voice announced . " This is the senior vice president of the Sloan Guaranty Trust , " Thatcher began . Then , in funereal tempo , he continued : " We have just received a letter claiming there is a bomb on the premises . " This was a familiar refrain at Centre Street . " You want the bomb squad , " the voice said kindly . During the inevitable clicks and buzzes , Thatcher had time to meditate on the state of a society where calls like his were commonplace . " Hello ! " the receiver boomed . " This is Captain Rasche . I hear you 've got a bomb letter . Just give me the name and address , will you ? " Captain Rasche was a specialist . There was nothing to it , according to him . They would evacuate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they went . It would be business as usual within three or four hours . " This is a rather large building , " Thatcher warned . " So were Macy 's and Rockefeller Center , " the Captain reminded him . " I 'll just coordinate with our Bank Department . ' We 'll have a team there in fifteen minutes . It 's a lucky thing you 're so handy . " In spite of these reassurances , Thatcher still thought that evacuating the Sloan might prove more complicated than the Captain realized . He was right . At the emergency meeting which he summoned , the director of bank security was the first to speak up . " I do n't believe in this bomb for a minute , " he said flatly . " You mean it 's just a hoax ? " Charlie Trinkam was frankly disappointed . For the first time in years , his working day promised more entertainment than his extracurricular life .  | " Hoax , hell ! This is the first step in a bank robbery . Do you realize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " The police , rather to Thatcher 's surprise , did not dismiss this idea . " Our bank boys thought of that one themselves , " Captain Rasche said , on arriving with a large supporting cast . " So we 've got a plan . " The plan , it developed , consisted of surrounding the bank with an impressive cordon of armed police . The evacuees would be passed through the cordon , which would remain in placefacing outwardsuntil the search was complete . " Nothing short of an army will be able to fight its way through , " Rasche promised hoarsely . The next objection came from the bank auditors . No one , they said darkly , absolutely no one could be allowed into the vaults in the absence of the examiners . That included New York City policemen . " Very well , " Thatcher said resignedly . " We will evacuate the building and search the office floors . By that time , we should have representatives of the auditors and the state examiners on hand . Then we can do the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems . All employees were urged to march promptly out of the building . The first six floors would use the stairs , the remainder would use the elevators . Only half of those on the payroll chose to honor these directions . An embellishment was soon added to the original instructions . Someone suggested that the fugitives sing ( and everybody suspected the head of the Glee Club , a man who did not find much artistic release in the computer section ) . Thatcher was not averse to any attempt to keep the retreat orderly . He did , however , deprecate the choice of Nearer My God to Thee . In the first place , it was anticlimactic : the employees were not going down with the Titanic . Sec-  | ondly , many marchers seemed unfamiliar with the hymn . And thirdly , those who knew the hymn were incapable of singing it correctly . But Everett Gabler , who approved all disciplined performances , exclaimed from his vantage point on the balcony : " It 's an impressive sight , is n't it ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thatcher replied austerely . The early departers were willing to flee empty-handed . Not so the loiterers . They appeared , eventually , bearing with them precious belongings . The Law Department , to a man , had chosen to bring along its files . Once free of the building , they set down their manila folders and squatted in a protective circle within the larger protection of the police cordon . " There are lots of people , " the general counsel hissed , " who 'd give their eye teeth to see these files . " In view of the fact that the Sloan was currently cooperating with investigations by the Federal Trade Commission , the Department of Justice , the Currency Committee of the House of Representatives and the New York State Banking Commission , Thatcher could only regard these precautions as ludicrous . Unless , of course , there was more in those files than he knew . The Real Estate Department had been equally assiduous . After commandeering an elevator for their exclusive use , they had brought down one trolley after another filled with brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pile which must include every mortgage held by the Sloan . From the looks they were darting southward , they expected a raid by the Law Department . " Remarkable ! " murmured Charlie Trinkam , who was strolling happily about , his hands in his pockets . Thatcher wondered where those cardboard boxes came from . Did Real Estate live in perpetual readiness for flight ?  | He reminded himself to take a closer look at their operations when he had more leisure . Many of the staff clutched personal possessions . George Lancer 's secretary , in his absence , had ostentatiously borne to safety the silver-framed photograph of his wife . Thatcher considered this objectively . George , he knew , was devoted to Lucy . But George was a realist . So long as he had the original , he was not likely to overvalue a Bachrach portrait . There was only one explanation . Miss Evans was trying to go beyond the call of duty . His own Miss Corsa had her little tin box . That box lived in the bottom drawer of her desk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Normally it was undisturbed . But at intervals Miss Corsa would remove it and take it to the ladies ' room . He had canvassed and rejected all the natural explanations . For a long time he had toyed with the idea that it contained aids to bedizenment which Miss Corsa reserved for state occasions . Then last week he had come up with the thought of an electric toothbrush , dedicated to special polishing before dental appointments . But would Miss Corsa feel it necessary to rescue her toothbrush ? " Mr. Thatcher ? " It was Captain Rasche , breaking in on this deplorable line of thought . He had finished his tour of the office floors and was prepared to pronounce them uncontaminated by explosives . " And now for the vaults ! " Everett Gabler wanted one thing clearly understood . " In addition to the examiners and the auditors , there will be two representatives of the bank accompanying your men , Captain ! " he said martially . There was no doubt in anyone 's mind that he was assigning himself to the party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " If anything 's going to blow up in there , the more the merrier. "  | Thatcher thought he saw a way to divert his pugnacious subordinate . " Everett , " he said gently , " you 're worrying about the wrong end of the stick . Has it occurred to you that , if people can introduce things into our vaults , sooner or later they will start thinking about abstracting them ? " Gabler was momentarily speechless . " Charlie and I will go with Captain Rasche , " Thatcher swept on . " I want you to keep an eye on things out here in case of unforeseen trouble . " At the door of the vault they encountered their first problem . The head cashier had not let his tellers leave the main floor until he had collected all cash boxes . Following the usage of years , he wanted to deposit them in the vaults . " Later , Wilkins , " Thatcher said impatiently . " But what am I supposed to do with them , Mr. Thatcher ? " Wilkins wailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to amass the cash boxes in any place except the vaults . " There must be over fifty thousand dollars here ! " " Hold onto them , " Thatcher said , sweeping by . The search of the vaults produced no bombs . It did however produce an occasion for an extemporary audit that was hard for certain professionals to resist . " So this is where you keep your bearer bonds . " The examiner was rubbing his hands together with unfeigned interest . " Not now , " said Trinkam and Thatcher in unison . " If you gentlemen do n't mind , " Rasche said with terrifying patience , " we still have a lot to do . " " What ? " asked Thatcher absently . He was detaching the auditor from a schedule of stock certificates . " We 've been everywhere . Mr. Hooper , please ! You can come back tomorrow if you insist ! " " We have n't done the safe deposit boxes . "  | Trinkam was appalled . " You want to open every one of the boxes ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment he was led astray by his own fertile imagination . " Not to mention how the bozoes who rent them will feel about it . " " Look , we have to face facts . If anyone wanted to plant a bomb down here , the easiest way to do it would be to rent a box and put the bomb inside . " Trinkam snorted contemptuously . " So what ? We 're not talking about an atomic bomb , are we ? " He looked at the steel and concrete by which they were surrounded . " It 's not going to bring the building down in ruins . Just a little bangbang and we all go on working . " " No , it would n't bring the building down . But it could do a lot of damage to anyone who was standing by it . What if one of your people is just pulling out a box ? Want one of them blown up ? " Charlie Trinkam loved his fellow man . " No , no ! " he protested . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all those locked boxes ! " Captain Rasche was unbudging . " There are master keys . There are locksmiths , " he said remorselessly . " We 've got boys who can drill out a lock . " It was a saddened band that trudged upstairs . Its only accomplishment was to gladden the heart of Mr. Wilkins by waving him back to the vaults . He was gripping his cash boxes with maniacal determination . Outside Thatcher realized that asking Everett Gabler to look out for trouble was flying in the face of providence . Everett was standing guard before the double doors . His meager body rigid with indignation , he was confronting a large , smiling man . " Outrageous ! " he was saying . " Just a little idea , " the large man said benignly.  | " John , " Everett snapped , " this is Mr. Hoffman of the Internal Revenue Service ! " The silence would have done justice to a first-act curtain . Mr. Hoffman was nothing if not ingratiating . " I understand you 'll be opening all your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along with you . " This bloodcurdling suggestion was accompanied by the deprecatory smile of a man whose wants are so pitiably modest that only a heart of stone could refuse him . " Not without a court order , you do n't ! " Thatcher said roundly . The smile was replaced by pained surprise . " I would n't take notes , " he offered hopefully . " NO ! " Mr. Hoffman shrugged . " We thought it was worth a try , " he said philosophically . " Nicolls ! " Thatcher called sternly . " Keep Mr. Hoffman entertained while we are inside . " Kenneth Nicolls , a pleasant young man , was confused but willing . As they left , they heard him asking Hoffman if he liked off-broadway theater . For once , Thatcher , Charlie Trinkam and Gabler were united . Their deepest instincts as bankers had been threatened . They were all gently seething . " It 's indecent , " Gabler said savagely . " You ca n't help admiring their gall , " Charlie admitted . It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I object to the easy assumption that we are mental defectives . " Thatcher was used to more sophisticated ploys from the federal government when it went on the rampage . " Well , " said Charlie , " when you deal with the great American public , it 's probably the most useful assumption to make . " Captain Rasche and his locksmiths led the way back downstairs .  | Given any large number of safe deposit boxes , the contents are ninety percent predictable and ten percent incomprehensible . The Sloan 's were no exception . There were the usual stacks of securities , life insurance policies , wills , and naturalization certificates . In a select assortment of boxes , there were large bundles of currency , from which everybody tactfully averted their eyes . " Mafia , " Captain Rasche assumed sadly . " And doctors , " Charlie added bracingly . Then there were obscure little packets which came in for special attention from the bomb squad . None of them contained explosives , detonators , acids or gases under pressure . " Why do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charlie asked the world at large . Captain Rasche leaped to the defense of the absent animal lover . " A personal memento , " he explained . " I remember when Fifi died , I could n't bring myself to throw out her things . There " he sighed nostalgically " there was a poodle ! " Then he pointed . " It would be harder to explain what that is doing down here , miles from where it can do any good . " That was a diaphragm . " Perhaps it , too , is a personal memento . " Charlie seemed quite taken with this sentiment . Reverently he closed the box . Everett Gabler was offended by the entire sordid exchange . The final review brought to light half a chicken sandwich ( " You mean you 're going to put it back ? " ) , a passport that was over twenty years out-of-date , packets of letters tied in the traditional pink ribbon ( " God , who would have thought anybody was still doing that ? " ) , and report cards for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The safe deposit boxes received the official seal of approval from Captain Rasche.  | " That 's that , " he announced . " Either it was a hoax , or someone thought they 'd get a chance for a break-in , and it did n't work out . " " And in your opinion , Captain , which is the more likely ? " For the first time , Rasche showed signs of fatigue . " We get an average of fifteen false alarms a day . Every nut in town knows this is the way to stir up a lot of excitement . With any other business , I 'd say it 's nine chances out of ten he 's out in the crowd somewhere , having himself a good laugh . " " And with the banking business ? " " Eight chances out of ten , " Rasche replied . His opinion of human nature was not high . " You can let your people back into the building now . " Getting them back was easier said than done . In spite of the vigilance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of employees had vanished . A large group of secretaries had last been seen heading for Liberty Street where there was a sale of knitted dresses at Wanamakers . Some of the computer technicians had disappeared into the Doubleday bookstore on Wall Street . Far too many trust officers had directed their steps to the nearest bar . " Just as I feared , " said Thatcher when this was reported to him . " Only the technicians read . " " But , Mr. Thatcher , " exclaimed the personnel manager , who did not understand what he was talking about , " how am I going to explain all this on the day sheets ? I 'm sure the Board will want to know . " Thatcher had already foreseen the inevitable meeting of the Board of Directors . But there was another question-andanswer session scheduled first . Captain Rasche wanted to have a little talk .  | Thatcher led Captain Rasche indoors . The Sloan Guaranty Trust now resembled nothing so much as an overturned hive . Upstairs in the Trust Department , conversational knots were strung along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a party of policemen , went virtually unnoticed in the buzz of emotions compared , adventures described and philosophy expounded . Rasche waxed expert . " Your first threat , I see , " he remarked as they walked on . Innes from International could be heard topping everybody with reminiscences of Guatemala where bombings are really bombings . Thatcher admitted that , until now , the Sloan had been spared the attention of terrorists . " It shows . " Rasche nodded sagely . " Your people still get excited . After they 've been through it once or twice , they 'll get pretty blase . Then too , if we have to clear the building when it 's raining hardwell , you 'll hear a lot of talk about lynching . " 183  | Thatcher resolutely banished the prospect of trying to run the bank as the staff trooped in and out to Exchange Place . Fortunately Miss Corsa , in the outer office , was a study in normalcy . Presumably her little tin box was safe in its drawer . To the naked eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the note that Captain Rasche examined quickly , then handed on to his aide . " St. Bernadette 's , " he read aloud . " Of course , they 've been getting themselves some real publicity . It 's possible that somebody just took advantage of it and used their name . That 's the way I 'd normally figure it . Except ... " He broke off , but Thatcher had no difficulty finishing the sentence . Except for murder . Rasche returned his attention . Experience , he told Thatcher , suggested that the note itself would offer scant help . There would be no fingerprintsor too many . " What we 'll try to do , " he began , " is trace how it got to you. , , " Perhaps we can help . " Thatcher rang for Miss Corsa . She was ahead of them . " I thought about that , " she reported , suggesting somehow that Thatcher and Rasche had been wasting time . " The note did n't come through the outside mail . There was no stamp . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thatcherwith no title or address . Only sixth floor . So I asked Sheldon . And he asked Manuel ... " The note had been deposited in the Sloan 's night drop sometime after the close of business yesterday . Early this morning , it had been collected , routed to the mail room , and delivered to Miss Corsa 's desk by the time she arrived . " Fine , " said Rasche . " We 'll check with the night men . Maybe one of them noticed something last night . " " I doubt it , " Thatcher commented . Hundreds of men  | and firms on Wall Street made use of the Sloan 's night deposit . Hence there was a fairly broad surveillance during the hours when Wall Street was silent , deserted and dangerous for anybody carrying large sums of cash . But during the rush hour , when thousands of men and women scurried past the Sloan to catch the subway , no one could ever identify a single figure slipping an envelope into a slot . " And we 'll check out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . " I 've already been in touch with Homicide . But one thingthis sixth floor business . How many people know your office is on the sixth floor ? " Thatcher was trying to recall when he became conscious that Miss Corsa was still in the doorway . Since Miss Corsa was never uncertain , this could only mean she had something to offer . " Yes , Miss Corsa ? " he broke off to ask . " The note did say down with all enemies of St. Bernadette 's , " she reminded them . " Should n't they be warned ? " " Now who would the enemies of St. Bernadette 's be , I wonder ? " Captain Rasche asked the world . " Unger Realty , " Miss Corsa informed him at once . " And the Chancery as well . " This effectively put an end to Rasche 's relaxation . Hurriedly , he got to his feet , informed Thatcher that further inquiries would be pursued , and departed . " But if that note was sent by anybody connected with St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did he hope to gain by creating a bomb scare here at the Sloan ? " Miss Corsa had a literal mind . " It stopped all work for a long time , " she observed . " I trust , Miss Corsa , that you are not being sarcastic at my expense , " said Thatcher . " As long as you 're here , let 's get started . I 'll have to see the department heads ... " Even as he made arrangements for an immediate tally of  | the damage , Thatcher pondered Miss Corsa 's words . How could interrupting the Sloan 's work help anybody at St. Bernadette 's ? Anybody at all . But the next two hours gave him little opportunity to explore this line of thought . Almost immediately , the department heads filed in , big with woe and lamentation . It was surprising what havoc had been wrought . For the first time in recorded history , the Sloan had unwittingly contravened several stringent requirements of local and national banking law . Specific instructions from clients had gone undischarged . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all meaning . Both Mellish , from Reserve Accounting , and Bannerman , from Federal Funds , were beyond lucid speech . Everett Gabler was not . " . . . and furthermore , three trust officers have completely disappeared . Among them , I regret to say , is Trinkam . " " Look on it , " Thatcher advised idly , " as a long lunch hour . Now , about this daily clearing report ... " Getting the Sloan back on even keel was not easy . Thatcher was giving brutally direct orders about collateral when Miss Corsa rang through . " No , Miss Corsa , you 'd better hold my calls , " he said impatiently . He had a very fair notion how this morning 's adventure would strike too many of his friends and acquaintances . Miss Corsa was severe . " I have already told Mr. Robichaux , Mr. Waymark and Mrs. Withers that you will return their calls later this afternoon . " " Fine , fine , " said Thatcher , penciling a list that Bannerman proffered with a shaking hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " is Mr. Unger . I think you will wish to speak to him . He is calling from a pay phone in a drugstore ... "  | Before Thatcher could digest her last words , an hysterical voice broke over him . " A bomb ! " said Unger . " Thank God Dad is n't here ! " " Is it a real bombor simply the threat of a bomb ? " Thatcher intervened to save time . Everybody in his office , he noticed , looked up . Even Bannerman became less morose . There was no doubt about it . Misery loves company . " They 're searching now , " Unger mumbled distractedly . " They 've cleared everybody out of the whole building . You ca n't imagine the mess " " Oh , yes I can , " said Thatcher grimly . " We had our own bomb threat this morning . " Unger was not interested in what happened at the Sloan . Thatcher broke in on a disjointed plaint . " Did you get a warning note ? " Unger Realty had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the switchboard just after lunch . Before succumbing to shock , Myrtle reported two sentences : You 've got a bomb in your office . You 're not going to destroy St. Bernadette 's . " Hinm , " said Thatcher . " My God ! What kind of people throw bombsjust because of some lousy real estate ? " Unger 's voice trembled . " What kind ... " This was no time to explain that St. Bernadette 's was more than a piece of real estate . Furthermore , if Thatcher had any appetite for temperamental outbursts , he could satisfy it in his own office . " Well , I wish you luck , " he said unsympathetically . " Let me know if you have an explosion . " He hung up without further ado . Everett left his truants for the moment . " A bomb threat at Unger Realty ? Surely that proves this is all tied to St. Bernadette 's , do n't you agree ? "  | " I should think so , " said Thatcher . It was a shame . Everett @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interim report for the Federal Reserve ? " Forty minutes later , Miss Corsa reappeared and said , " It was another hoax at Unger Realty . They did n't find a bomb . " Thatcher looked up from the draft he and Bannerman were hammering out . " Good , " he said absently . " Keep me abreast of what happens to the Chancery too , wo n't you , Miss Corsa ? " She did not conceal her deep disapproval of nonchalance on such a subject . " Mr. Gaven from Communications wants to speak to you , " she said , ignoring his last observation . " He was in an anti-demolition unit during the war . He wants to know if he can organize a Sloan Bomb Squad . " " Tell him , " said Thatcher with careful control , " to send me a memo . " The next thing would be a Sloan Vigilante Committee , challenging the Glee Club for members . Why not ? Everybody else was going crazy . Why expect the Great Sloan Family to be immune ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a complex proposition for shifting any liability the Sloan might have incurred to other shoulders any shoulders . Everett was barely finished before Miss Corsa was back . " Now what ? " Thatcher demanded before it dawned on him that Miss Corsa was looking shaken . It had been , after all , a long , hard day . " It just came over the ticker , " she announced . Thatcher glanced down at his watch . The market had closed hours ago without further collapse . Could war have been declared ? " They 're evacuating the Chancery , " Miss Corsa said  | hollowly . " Somebody 's threatened to bomb the Cardinal ! " It was late in the evening before Thatcher felt free to call a halt . All that man could do had now been done . With luck , the Sloan should be able to face the morrow as if today had never been . " All bark and no bite , " Charlie Trinkam commented . He had drifted back to work with his customary insouciance . Now he was sitting on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a casual postmortem . Miss Corsa cast him a look of burning reproach which he interpreted correctly . " Come on , Rose , " he cajoled . " It was only another hoax at the Chancery , was n't it ? Nobody blew anybody up . " Since this was true , Miss Corsa fell back on dignity . Was that , she asked Mr. Thatcher , all ? " Yes , " said Thatcher . There was no use thanking Miss Corsa for her heroic performance . The way to do so was by a gift . Not even Miss Corsa could brush aside some splendid object from Bergdorf 's . " It 's a neat twist , " Charlie observed . Walter Bowman , smothering a yawn , asked for an explanation . Charlie expanded . " Here we are , going crazy with bomb threats all day long . The Sloan closes down . Unger has gone crackers , from what I hear . And when they had to evacuate the Chancerywell , they just about sealed off midtown . They got so many cops and firemen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Park ground to a stop . They 're just breaking up the jam now . " It had , everybody agreed , been a memorable day . " And it 's all because of some dummy worked up about St. Bernadette 's , right ? " Charlie went on . Thatcher replied that was a reasonable presumption . " Well , " Charlie resumed , " you can bet your bottom dol-  | lar there 's no excitement at St. Bernadette 's . You know Flensburg types . The original good solid citizens . They 're sitting around watching TV . They 're going to bed early . If there 's any excitement at all up there , it 's a whist party at the rectory . " Charlie for one preferred a bomb threat to a whist party any day . He was , however , inaccurate . It was not whist . It was beano . " . . . Number . . . twenty . . . two , " called out the man on the platform . Groans , delighted cries , intent silence . At long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then looked up to watch number twenty-two being chalked on the blackboard behind the revolving wheel . " Everybody ready ? The next . . . number . . . is . . number . . . eight . . . eight ... " Prominently displayed beside the caller were the prizes wrested by the sodality from Flensburg merchants : a toaster , two canned hams , a painted china lamp and a clock radio . But the half-hundred St. Bernadette 's parishioners who regularly gathered for the weekly game were drawn as much by the desire for simple sociability as by the hope of something for nothing . From the door , Father Doyle looked on with approval . He did not share Charlie Trinkam 's view of the world . Flensburg quiet , Flensburg seeking its excitement in a friendly game of beanothis was the Flensburg Father Doyle knew and loved . Just as he loved the Flensburg already home in bed , at ten o'clock in the evening . " . . . number twenty-six . . . twenty-six . . . " " BEANO ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight weeks ! "  | Around her rose a hum of cheerful disappointment , of congratulations . A fine scene , Father Doyle rejoiced . Happy . Peaceful . The way it should be . While Mrs. Lento went up to collect her clock radio , Father Doyle decided to duck outdoors for a breath of air . With a rare sense of well-being , he gazed up and down Jackson Boulevard . Quiet and peaceful here too . Whatever was happening elsewhere , Flensburg was not a battleground . " And thanks for mercies rendered , " said Father Doyle to himself . He was turning to go back indoors when he heard it . There was one sharp report . Then silence . Bewildered , he shook his head . Jackson Boulevard was still quiet . His old ears , he decided , must be playing tricks . Suddenly he went rigid . From inside the parish hall , there came the drumming of many feet . " Mary , Mother of God ! " he croaked . There was a breathless voice behind him . " Father , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stare at the man . Somebody ran out into the parking lot . Frantically he pointed . A dull red glare pulsated in the sky . " Fire ! " somebody shouted . There was a concerted rush past Father Doyle . " Fire ! The school 's on fire ! " " Where 's the fire alarm ? " And finally in the fearful excitement , there was another voice . " It 's a bomb ! " screamed a woman . " They 've bombed St. Bernadette's. "  | Within moments the schoolyard and parking lot were thronged . The beano players , naturally , were first on the scene , leaving behind them overturned chairs , scattered score cards , the chewed stumps of pencils and the lamp which was to have been the next prize . Even the wheel used for drawing numbers was knocked from its stand in the hasty exodus . But they were soon joined by others who had heard the blast or seen the brilliant flash . Most shops across Jackson Boulevard were closed for the night . Phil Kavanaugh , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was culling unsold paperbacks to be returned to the distributor . ( It was his boast that every single volume on display had been approved by Sister Veronica . Sister Veronica was too wise to ask what was under the counter . ) When the explosion came , Kavanaugh stiffened . For several seconds he remained bent over a pile of books , with only his head raised . His eyes glittered . Then he hurried to the sidewalk and broke into an awkward , angular trot . 192  | The Parents League headquarters had also been occupied . Weeks ago a young couple had volunteered to check returned questionnaires . Even before the police had relinquished the store front , the Connors had picked up Mary Foster 's master list , gathered the mail from the post office and set to work . Riots and tenants ' crusades had come and gone . Unnoticed , the Connors continued their selfappointed task . Just as their work became irrelevant , they finished it . ( Question : Why do you wish to send your child to St. Bernadette 's ? Check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much would you be willing to pay to continue sending your child to St. Bernadette 's ? The figures below represent weekly payment per child . ) They had triumphantly filed their summary and were locking the front door when Joan Connor pointed and seized her husband 's arm . With great presence of mind Ed Connor rushed inside and called the fire department . The nuns in the convent beyond the playground were leaving their chapel after the last service of the day . They were in the habit of chatting for a few minutes before retiring . ( " Why are suppers so much worse when Sister Columba plans them ? I know it 's good for Sister Columba to mortify herself by performing an uncongenial duty . But what about the rest of us ? Could n't Reverend Mother assign Sister Columba a different duty ? Like polishing the silver ? " ) They saw , they gasped , they rushed forward . All these people were in the schoolyard by the time the windows of the small annex were reflecting a ruddy glow . Their numbers were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steadies from the Galway Tavern . Newcomers soon heard about the bang and the flash . Everybody noticed that the fire fighters were quickly reinforced by technicians from the fire marshal 's office and the police bomb squad . Teenagers in the crowd turned up their transistor radios when the inevitable spot announcement came :  | " We interrupt this program . A bomb has just exploded at St. Bernadette 's Catholic School in Flensburg . Earlier today bomb threats were received at St. Patrick 's Chancery , the Sloan Guaranty Trust and Unger Realty . . . " An hour later St. Bernadette 's was no longer recognizable . Trampling feet and rivers of water had churned the yard into a sea of mud . Everywhere , heavy hoses being recoiled were a hazard . Broken glass and crumbling ash surrounded the blackened shell of the annex . Smoke , still hanging like a pall over the building , reeked of charred wood . The fire fighting was over . The main block of the school had been saved . Even the ruined annex was still structurally sound . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then an object was retrieved and carried to the bomb squad . Most of Flensburg was now milling around the disaster area and overheard the conclusions being drawn . " It 's not hard to see how this was set up . The annex is a large room with a kitchenette . The mothers take turns supervising lunch hour . Somebody used a Molotov cocktail with this primitive fuse . But the pilot on the gas stove was extinguished with the taps left open . That 's where the explosion came from . Luckily the fuse was only good for about five minutes . Otherwise there would have been a big enough blast to bring the annex down . " The implications of this speech were horrifying enough to reach the very edges of the crowd in minutes . " Did you hear what he said ? That was a bomb in the school ! " " What if the kids had been there ? They could all have been killed ! " " They made a mistake with the fuse . They were trying to bring down the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a monster do we have in Flensburg ? "  | Several people were swift to draw the same conclusion as the radio announcer . " You heard about the bomb scares they had today over at St. Pat 's and that bank ? Well , this is the same thing " Someone was outraged at the comparison . " What do you mean , it 's the same thing ? There were n't any bombs in those other places ! " A mother went further . " And there were n't any kids ! My God , this must be a maniac . " Then , off to one side , there were shouts of a different description . " Hey ! Make room up there ! Father Doyle 's coming . " The crowd split , creating an aisle which led to the bomb squad . At the end of it Father Doyle appeared , supported by Mary Foster and the Ianellos . He tottered as he walked , confused and bewildered . But he spoke with the stubborn insistence of a man who will not believe what he hears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistake . What are you about , letting everybody spread these lies ? " Sal Ianello was holding one of his arms . " Now , Father , " he said soothingly , " I know it 's terrible , but you must n't " Father Doyle jerked his arm away . " Do n't be a fool ! " he snapped . " You 're like children , all of you . Wanting to dramatize things ! There 's been a fire , that 's all . Someone was careless . " Quietly Ianello replaced his hand . Father Doyle did not seem to notice . He was muttering to himself now . " A fire , that 's what it must be . " Over his head , Mary Foster and the Ianellos exchanged anguished glances . Sal bobbed his head toward Mary , indicating that she should take over . The priest would be more comfortable talking to a woman . Mary went to work immediately . " The fire is out now , Father . The engines came right away and it did n't take them more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  | She tried hard to banish any suggestion of the cheerful nurse as she urged the party forward . " These are the men who were in charge . We owe them a lot . " The fire marshal and the head of the bomb squad came forward to meet them . " And who would you be ? " Father Doyle demanded . They identified themselves . " Now we 'll have the truth of it , " the priest grunted with satisfaction . " Tell them this business about a bomb is nonsense . " The two men were sympathetic but firm . Patiently they produced evidence , outlined their reasoning , and explained about fuses and gas concentrations . " I 'm afraid there is n't any doubt , Father , " the marshal said with kind finality . " Anybody could figure out how to do it . The whole thing could have been rigged up in a couple of minutes . " At first Father Doyle struggled , his eyes flickering away from the length of fuse , his head averted from the gaping window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to overtax his strength . He sagged against his companions . " Who is there in my parish , " he asked himself , " who could do such a thing ? " " Father Doyle ! " Mary Foster cried . " This is too much for you ! You should be resting . " The priest drew on his last reserves of will power . He tried to draw himself erect . " I must know how this happened . I must know everything about it . Then maybe I will understand why . " Sal Ianello was gentle . " Yes , of course , Father . But these men are still working . I 'll find out everything and tell you tomorrow morning . " He started to turn the old man around . " But now , there are Mrs. Dewey and Father James waiting to take you home . You must rest tonight . "  | The rectory housekeeper had been hovering on the outskirts of the group for some time . She and Father James came forward together . " I 'm an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm too old to understand all this . " Mrs. Dewey slipped an arm around him and he allowed himself to be led back to the rectory . Father James brought up the rear . The crowd watched them go in silence . Then there was a collective sigh . Before Father Doyle came they had been excited and aghast . Now the first rumblings of collective anger began . " Are we going to take this ? What if this guy decides to have another crack ? " " We were lucky this time . But we have to protect the kids . We may not be so lucky next time . " As the first call for action was raised , two newcomers burst onto the scene . They came loping down Jackson Boulevard together , but at the entrance to the schoolyard they split . Bob Horvath headed straight for his fellow parishioners . Willard Ericson made a beeline for the officials . " My God , is it true ? " Horvath demanded . " I did n't know a thing about it . But Ericson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He picked me up on the way . " Eager voices were quick to assure him it was all true , to repeat what the marshal had said , to describe how Father Doyle was a broken man . " It was awful , " said Pat Ianello , still pale . " Poor Father Doyle ! He aged twenty years right in front of us . " " That 's tough , " Horvath agreed readily . " I hope he 'll be all right . " Everybody said that Father Doyle was no longer a young man . It would take time for him to recover from the shock . " I told him I 'd find out everything I could , " Sal said , " and tell him all about it tomorrow morning . "  | " Yeah , sure . " Bob Horvath was frowning . " Of course , he 's got a right to know . But look , Sal , we ca n't expect too much from Father Doyle . It would n't be right to load him with our problems . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's the priest , is n't he ? " " Sure he is . But he does n't really understand what 's going on . And he does n't know much about courts and television and that sort of thing . What I mean to say is that we do n't have to wait until tomorrow morning . We 've got Mr. Ericson here right now . " This news was a tonic to the crowd . " Let 's see what Mr. Ericson has got to say , " someone shouted from the rear . " Go on , Bob , " a woman urged . " Get him over here . " But Willard Ericson had already finished with the fire marshal . He was bustling forward . From every corner of the schoolyard , parents hurried to swell the crowd around him . They were tense with anticipation . Precise as ever , Ericson looked over his glasses at his audience . " The marshal has assured me that the explosion was deliberately caused by a bomb . It was a very simple contrivance apparently , available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they remained hopeful . Experience had proved that Willard Ericson was a slow starter . He liked to review the obvious . " So we run no danger of being suspected of irresponsible accusations . Now is the time to strive for maximum publicity . We have nothing to lose and everything to gain . The sympathetic response will be enormous . No television viewer will regard the parents of St. Bernadette 's as anything but victims . " Ericson had lost contact with his clients . He was far too able a lawyer not to sense this . Unfortunately he could not  | imagine why . He paused , trying to assess the feelings around him . There was nothing definite . Only that slight , silent withdrawal . Mary Foster was the one who spoke up . " But Mr. Ericson , " she said tautly , " there are no television cameras here . " Could this be what was bothering them ? Ericson hastened to reassure her . " We 'll get them here . By tomorrow morning we could probably arrange a special half-hour on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sal Ianello was choking with rage . " Are you crazy or something ? Telling us we 've got nothing to lose ? I 've got a little girl going to St. Bernadette 's . " Too late , Ericson tried to consider this aspect of the situation . " But , Mr. Ianello , " he protested , " your little girl is n't going to be affected by a publicity campaign about the bombings . I do n't " " I do n't want a publicity carnival about these bombings , " Sal raged . " I do n't want to attract every nut in the city . I want to stop the bombings ! " There was no doubt about the sentiment of the crowd . Cries of encouragement rose on all sides . Bob Horvath was looking at Ericson in stunned disappointment . Mary Foster had moved a few paces away from him . " That 's telling them , Sal ! " " You can count on me , Sal ! " " We do n't need a lot of outsiders making hay from this ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How , they asked , was Sal going to go about things ? What could they do ? " I 'll tell you if you 'll all shut up ! " Unconsciously , the circle was reforming . At its center was Sal Ianello . Pat and Mary Foster stood near him . Only Bob Horvath was still watching Willard Ericson . " The first thing we 've got to do is start guarding the  | school . This would n't have happened tonight if we 'd had some sort of a watch . " Here was a limited objective within their powers . Parents worried about their children were being offered the opportunity to do something effective . Enthusiastically they offered their services . " No , hear me out ! " Sal held up a restraining hand . " We 've got to organize this . There are over a hundred fathers with children in the school . We 'll set up shifts . Everybody will take a turn . " " Mothers too ! " a woman called . Grimly Sal continued to cleave his way through distractions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main point is that the school should be guarded every minute , day and night . No one gets into St. Bernadette 's with bottles or packages of any kind . We 'll set up a checking station if we have to . " " I just hope the bastard tries again , " a father said threateningly . " If I 'm on duty , he wo n't be in shape to play those tricks ever again . " Other fathers echoed him . " And no outsiders , " someone suggested . " Even if they 're not carrying anything . No one but parents and teachers get anywhere near the school . That 'll do the trick . " Bob Horvath had shifted allegiance . Abandoning Willard Ericson , he called out , " Put me down , Sal . Any time of the night . You 've got this thing licked . " " Oh , no , I have n't ! " The excited chirpings came to a halt . What was Sal saying ? " Listen to me ! Having guards at the school is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week , maybe a month . But we ca n't do it forever . " " We can try ! " they promised loyally . " Sure , we 'll try , " Sal rejoined . " But we do n't want to  | turn St. Bernadette 's into some kind of jail . We want a normal school , like we used to have . And I 'll tell you one thing . All this trouble started because the Cardinal wants to sell the school . ' Well , it was one thing when it was a question of money . I did n't agree with the Cathedral , but I could see how they were thinking in terms of dollars and cents . But things are different now . They 're playing with the lives and safety of our children . We 've got to make them see that . " The chorus of approval was deafening . " The Cardinal will have to back down now . There is n't any other way of looking at things any more . Not when people are throwing bombs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school . " Cheers ! The voice was a hoarse croak by now . " So we 're going to want two lists . While some of us are guarding the school , the rest of us are going to have to go in to St. Patrick 's . We 'll make them see things our way if we have to picket Mass on Sunday ! I want as many of you as can come . And I want everybodymen , women , grandparents , teenagers . I want Monsignor Miles to see that all of St. Bernadette 's is standing together . And we expect the Church to stand with us ! " Sal Ianello was a man who had found his hour .  | Many Flensburg fathers did not go to work the following morning . This was only to be expected . But the aftermath of the bombing disrupted other schedules as well . John Thatcher did not reach his office until after eleven o'clock . Charlie Trinkam , encountering him at the elevator , hovered on the brink of pleasantry . One quick look was enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trinkam said sedately . " Good morning , Charlie . " Charlie escaped unscathed to pass the word : all signs pointed to a bad day . Miss Corsa was not so fortunate . " Good morning , Mr. Thatcher , " she said . It was enough . " I realize that I have missed an appointment , " Thatcher declaimed . " Let me assure you that I did not oversleep . On the contrary . " Miss Corsa withheld comment . " Since early this morningvery early this morning I  | have been occupied with St. Bernadette 's , " said Thatcher , shrugging off his coat . " First it was a phone call from Ericson . This was followed by calls from the police . Then Unger . Finally the papers . I have already refused to make any public statement on behalf of the Sloan four times . Furthermore , I have arranged for doublingif not treblingour security guard for the duration . " Miss Corsa knew her duty . " The New York Times would like to interview " " Miss Corsa ! " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bernadette 's , enough of Catholic parochial schools , enough of the entire Archdiocese of New York ! I am certainly giving no interviews on the subject . Will you please remember that ? I do not want to be reminded of St. Bernadette 's in any way , shape or formfor what little remains of the morning ! Or , if you can manage it , for the rest of the year ! " " Certainly , Mr. Thatcher , " said the perfect secretary . " Are you ready to see Mr. Bowman now ? " " Send him in , " Thatcher ordered . By ill chance , Walter had not been alerted by Trinkam . He breezed past Miss Corsa . " Morning , John ! Say , that 's a surprise , is n't itthat bombing out in Flensburg ? After yesterday , I was willing to bet that some joker was running around just trying to scare everybody . But not trying hard enough to use real bombs . Thenpowee ! And that 's another thing . We had three big bomb warnings . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No warning at all , according to the radio this morning . Do you suppose . . . ? " Belatedly , the prevailing chill penetrated . Walter trailed off . " I think , " said Thatcher bleakly , " that we 'll leave bombs and bombers to the authorities . Now , about that forecast you were going to show me. "
