IT was midafternoon when I arrived at Los Angeles International Airport on October 23 , 1978 , but the sky was already dark . Driving home along the Pacific Ocean , I could see black to the north and west  --  boiling clouds of smoke coming off the Santa Monica Mountains . By six o'clock , 1 was standing in front of my house , in Pacific Palisades , watching waves of orange flame break over the mountains . Houses in the path of the waves exploded silently just before the flames reached . them . I counted eight  --  puffs of bright gas , and then the houses were gone . By seven o'clock , I was packing the car  --  family photograph albums and insurance policies first  --  and listening to a radio report of tires melting as people tried to escape the fire in automobiles . At eight o'clock , the winds  --  the fierce desert winds called Santa Anas  --  suddenly died down , and the waves of fire spent themselves north of Sunset Bou levarcl , five blocks away . In places , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My first earthquake was on New Year 's Day of 1979 . A friend and I were having a late lunch in a little place called the Inn of the Seventh Ray , in Topanga Canyon . There was a heavy jolt , and the floor vibrated . I thought a truck had hit the building . But the floor did not stop vibrating , as it would have if the building had been struck . I was confused . Actions seemed to be taking place in slow motion . People pushed chairs and tables aside , stood up , and began running toward the door . I realized that there was a sound  --  a steady roaring , as if a freight train were coming into the room . Outside , I still heard the sound and felt the vibration . Stones were clattering down a hillside into the roadway . The next day 's Los Angeles Times reported that the quake was " small " - 4.6 on the Richter scale . It had lasted less than ten seconds , and there were twenty smaller aftershocks . While it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this thing would be judged small by instruments at the California Institute of Technology . I had already begun to wonder whether God intended for people to live in Los Angeles . Certainly He never meant for millions of them to live there . One of the first Europeans who saw the place  --  Father Juan Crespi , a Spanish missionary who passed through in August of 1769 ? wrote that the area was beautiful and a perfect place for a mission settlement . But he also noticed the signs of alternating drought and " great floods , " and felt earthquake after earthquake , " which astonishes us . " The men who followed Crespi defied God , defied nature , living in air they regularly poisoned , rerouting the rivers , levelling the hills , filling the canyons , building thousands and thousands of homes among the gnarled little trees and bushes  --  the " brush " in brushfires  --  that burn periodically and so make room for new growth , on slopes that continually slide back into canyons , above earthquake fault lines veined deep into the earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " There would be very few people in Los Angeles if they had to live with the energy , the wood , and the water that are naturally here , " Richard Lillard , a retired professor of American studies and English at California State University , Los Angeles , told me not long ago . " Everything is imported . Four-fifths of the water in Los Angeles comes from other places  --  from as far away as four hundred and forty-four miles to the north . Nature has been pushed further here  --  a long way indeed  --  than almost anyplace on earth . " Lillard has spent a professional lifetime thinking and writing about the ecology of Southern California , and in 1966 he put his thoughts together in a book titled " Eden in jeopardy . " He wrote then , " Southern California speeds from one brilliant improvisation to another , valuing means , neglecting ends ... the sun never rises and sets twice on the same landscape . " We sat talking last summer on the deck of Lillard 's house , in the Hollywood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty miles of Los Angeles and the Pacific Ocean . " The city is a triumph of American genius and greed , " he said . " What we 're looking at was once a grassy plain . There were deer and antelope out there , and the Los Angeles River flowed through . It 's been rerouted , of course , but it flowed through there " ? he pointed to West Hollywood " and nature remembers . There was a big rain in 1969 , the spring of ' 69 , and water began coming up near houses on Melrose and La Cienega . The original springs under La Cienega had begun to rise again . " West Hollywood is on the " City " side of Los Angeles , between the Pacific and forty miles of the Santa Monica Mountains . The Hollywood Hills are part of the southern slope of the Santa Monicas , a range with peaks that reach up to three thousand feet . To the north of the Santa Monicas is " the Valley " ? the San Fernando Valley , flatland that stretches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was desert before water was pumped to it from farther north . When we talked about Los Angeles , we were talking about the basin of the Los Angeles River  --  roughly a thousand square miles between the San Gabriels and the sea , from Malibu in the north to Long Beach in the south . Politically , the area is a collage of cities  --  the City of Los Angeles , Santa Monica , Beverly Hills , and others  --  and communities scattered through the southern part of Los Angeles County . Perhaps six million people live in that basin . " This is a city built by Yankee ingenuity , " Lillard said . " The mud flats at the end of the continent were turned into harbors , marinas were dredged , the hills were levelled and nicked , and the canyons filled in . The water is imported . Even the air is imported , by the Santa Anas from the desert . Otherwise , no one could breathe the air that civilization has brought to the basin The changes in nature have made us all vulnerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , almost got me in Beverly Glen  --  my deck furniture was smoldering from the heat  --  but the flames stopped about twenty feet from the house . Up there " ? he pointed to the hills ? " that 's been bulldozed and filled ; it 's held up by cement pylons , but the earth still has a tendency to obey the law of gravity . 1 , Ve have n't had ' the storm of the century ' yet  --  that 's a geologists ' term . The last one was in the eighteen-eighties . A lot of water will come  --  twelve inches in twenty-four hours , say It would tear out half of what you and I are looking at right now . " JOHN D. WEAVER is also a Los Angeles writer , the author of a book on the city titled " El Pueblo Grande . " He and his wife , Harriett , are active in the Federation of Hillside and Canyon Associations , a conglomeration of citizen groups that monitors hillside development in thirty-one communities . Standing behind his house , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said , " That ridge over there is above Stone Canyon . That 's where the Bel Air fire started in 1961 : They think a bulldozer backfired or struck a spark . There were  --  let 's see if I can remember . Harriett , how many acres hurried in the Bel Air fire ? " Harriett Weaver is considered one of Los Angeles ' experts on brushfires . She has many titles , among them chairperson of the Mayor 's Brush Clearance Committee . " Six thousand and ninety acres burned , " she said . " Four hundred and eighty-four homes were destroyed , and the total property loss was about twenty-five million dollars . " She continued , " The fires are a natural part of the ecological system . Dead growth has to burn nff to continue the life cycle of the chaparral on these hills . The problem came with urbanization in the middle of the brush . A third of the city is in brush . In Los Angeles County , they joke that they do n't need fire maps , because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IVe are just asking for it . The deadwood underneath the green that you see out there is soaked with resin and oils . It literally explodes . An acre of brush is the fuel equivalent of fifteen hundred to two thousand gallons of gasoline . Ernie Hanson , a fire chief in Los Angeles , got a lot of attention a few years ago by calculating that a hundred acres of brush five feet high can produce the same amount of heat as the atomic bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima . " I asked Mrs. Weaver about the fire I had seen in Mandeville Canyon , in the Santa Monicas , on October 23 , 1978 . She said that it had burned sixty-one hundred acres . Another fire that day , fifteen miles to the north , had burned twenty-five thousand three hundred and eighty-five acres between Agoura and Malibu . The two fires together damaged or destroyed two hundred and seventy houses and caused forty million dollars ' worth of property damage . Two persons were killed in the Agoura fire . " The thing that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fires moved , " Mrs. Weaver said . " It all happened within twenty-four hours , and the Santa Anas were above thirty-five miles an hour . If the wind had n't died down , there would n't have been a prayer of keeping the Mandeville fire from jumping Sunset Boulevard . " I had been standing on the other side , the south side , of Sunset . " Someday there will be a holocaust in this town , " she added . John Weaver said , " Not too far from our house , they built some houses that sold for around two hundred thousand dollars . " He pointed again to the ridge west of us . " That view was a selling point . They did n't tell the buyers that they 're planning to cut the top off the ridge and use the dirt to fill that little canyon  --  that they want to flatten out the view to build more houses . They 're taking fifty feet off the top of the ridge and putting a hundred and sixty-five feet of fill in the canyon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Those homes down there will be flooded out unless the area gets adequate drainage . That 's how it works . " " Floods and landslides are a real problem in the hills , " Mrs. Weaver said . " A house half a block down the street lost its front yard in the last rain , and the whole thing is likely to go am - time . The brush is important you need to leave enough to hold the hills against erosion but not enough to form a fire canopy . Worst of all , the developers cut out the toe of hills to get in that extra house . Much of the soil here is clay , and sooner or later , usually when they 're wet , the geological planes slide out like cards from a deck . People are n't aware of the dangers  --  particularly people from the East . That 's who they sell these houses to . " The Weavers talked on about the danger of slides , showing me clippings from the Los Angeles Times . In one story , about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Robb , chief of the city 's Grading Division , the section of the Department of Building and Safety that regulates the preparation of land for development , was quoted as saying that homeowners might be responsible for much of their own trouble . " One problem is educating hillsich. ? homeowners to maintain their property , " Robb said . " Many mudslides have been caused by stopped drains and the overwatering of plants and other kinds of neglect . " " Overwatering of plants ? " I said . " Are the hills that unstable ? " " They can be , " John ' Weaver said . " You have to be careful of gopher holes , too . " He showed me some Polaroid snapshots a neighbor had taken of a house in a nearby canyon which had been caved in by a mudslide in March of 1978 . " They 've put the house hack together now , " he said . " You 'd come out from New York and buy that house tomorrow . It looks fine . What you would n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  that 's why we get these periodic punishments . It 's a man-made city , a tribute to rapacity and tenacity . There were people who could make money by putting a city here  --  the last place there should have been one . Hell , most of Los Angeles was just a swath of desert between great harbors in San Francisco and San Diego . " THE next day , I went over to Tarzana , four miles west of Sherman Oaks , to meet a friend of the Weavers ' , Irma Dobbyn , who is also active in the Federation of Hillside and Canyon Associations . " They 're building in steeper and steeper territory , " Mrs. Dobbyn said . " Let me show you something . " She took moot to her patio and pointed . We were looking at a bare beige pyramid that was flat-topped and terraced . " They 've be as much as fifty per cent  --  and the city is allowing ninety-three houses . The developers originally wanted four hundred and thirty-eight houses , but we cut them down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The lots start at three hundred thousand dollars apiece , so , with houses , the cost of most of the properties will be well over a million dollars . The developers cut fifty feet from the mountaintop over there and about a hundred feet here . The fill dumped in the canyon will eventually be two hundred and eighty-five feet deep . The city says it 'll be a safe development , but no one knows for sure . No one has enough knowledge or control over the elements , the geology . We ca n't keep up with the technology of earthmoving and building . In the last fifteen years , the developers have learned to carve the mountains up into flatlands . These are just flatland developments with a view . " The view was truly spectacular . In places , we were overlooking both the City and the Valley  --  Beverly Hills to the south , Studio City to the north . " That 's called Benedict Hills , " Mrs. Melograno said after we had driven a few miles west along Mulholland . We were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start at four hundred and fifty thousand dollars . The developer wanted to build five hundred and fifty houses , but we got him down to three hundred and forty . They 're still building . " " It 's a nice setting , " I said , and she looked at me strangely . " It used to be a lot nicer , " she said . " They moved six million cubic yards of earth here beginning in 1970 . There was a mountain there . " She pointed into the air above a cluster of thirty houses . " They cut off a hundred and sixty-five feet of it to get more houses in . That 's when the mudslides began . I spent one Christmas Eve shovelling mud out of the house of a friend . There 's not much that the city can do . We do n't do any testing work ourselves . We evaluate the reports of private geologists . We have to take their word , and , of course , most of them are hired by the developers . The only way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the land , and it does n't have the money . " " Is there corruption involved ? " I asked . " Is somebody making enormous amounts of money here ? " " No , " she said . " I do n't think there 's much of that . Basically , it 's the American way  --  the attitude that a man has a right to do whatever hr pleases with his own property . Even if it 's dangerous for him and for everybody else . And it is dangerous . Anyone who wants to live on a hillside here faces the same hazards  --  fire , water , and earth . People are willing to take the chance because there 's peace and quiet , they 're still closer to nature , and the air is cleaner up here . They accept the chance that something will happen . They live with danger . " " Are you one of them ? " I asked . " Yes . " THE flight to the hills was no doubt another attempt to outwit nature . The air is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smog that sometimes blankets the flatlands of both the City and the Valley . The day Mrs. Melograno and I stood on Mulholland Drive  --  September I 2th  --  was one of the worst days for breathing in Los Angeles history . The city was alive with " Stage 2 " smog alerts . The day was one of eight consecutive Stage 2 days  --  a record unmatched since 1955 ? and admissions to local hospitals because of chronic lung disorders were increasing by fifty per cent a day . The basin is routinely in a state of inversion ; that is , a pool of stagnant , humid air is trapped above the city by a lid of warmer , drier air that forms north of Hawaii and drifts eastward until It is trapped by the Santa Monicas and the San Gabriels . Pollution , particularly from automobiles , pumps into the stagnant mass until ocean breezes or Santa Anas wash away the whiskey-colored gases . The hills , however , are usually above the inversion level , which often reaches only three hundred feet above sea level . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Melograno , I watched helicopters chattering toward Sepulveda Pass , a cut through the Santa Monicas . They dropped , quite accurately , columns of water on a brushfire climbing up the hills along the San Diego Freeway . The fire was stopped after it had covered ten acres . Los Angeles is very good at that sort of thing . It has to be . Disaster ? " holocaust , " Harriett Weaver had said is always near . " Disaster control " has real meaning here , and the city office charged with that function is the Office of Civil Defense , in City Hall East  --  or , rather , under City Hall East . I drove down four levels below the ground , parked my car , and then took an elevator down another level before being admitted  --  by buzzer  --  through eight-foot-high steel vault doors that lead to the office of the director , Mi- Earthquakes are certainly going to happen again . There were four around Los Angeles in June of this year . What the city is worried about is a big one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working on that day , with the city 's Task Force on Earthquake Prediction . No one is yet sure whether there actually is a science of earthquake prediction  --  the Chinese reportedly predicted a large quake in 1976 and evacuated hundreds of thousands of citizens from the threatened area before tremors began but the need for such ca-pability is obvious . The " General Background " section of the Task Force 's October , 1978 , Consensus Report began : In mid-February , 1976 , the U.S , Geological Survey announced the discovery of a major uplift of the earth covering a large area that is centered approximately on the San Andreas fault in Southern California . Because of its large size and its alignment along a segment of the San Andreas fault that is known ? to have been - locked " since Southern California 's last great earthquake . in 1857. scientists expressed the concern that the " Palmdale Bulge , " or " Southern California Uplift , " may foreshadow the next great earthquake in the region . In mid-March , 1976 , the U.S. Geological Survey noted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issued a warning : " If an earthquake similar to that in 1857 occurred today in the region about thirty miles north of Los Angeles , the probable losses in Orange and Los Angeles Counties alone are estimated as follows : 40,000 buildings would collapse or he seriously damaged . 3,000 to 12,000 people would he killed . 12,000 to 48,000 people would be hospitalized. $15 billion to $25 billion in damage would occur . Failure of one of the larger dams could leave 100,000 homeless , and tens of thousands dead . " If such a disaster occurred , Los Angeles might be run from a complex of rooms visible through a glass wall behind Michael Regan 's desk . The emergency-operations center is encased in concrete , and it contains food , water , generators , and dormitories designed to sustain three hundred people for two weeks . " This is supposed to withstand a war , " Regan said . It looked as if it could . The heart of the center is a cross-shaped " war room . " One arm of the cross ( Regan 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the chiefs of the Police and Fire Departments and their staffs . The other arm , interestingly , is reserved for the press , on the theory that what is must important  --  the operations center has already been used for fire and rain emergencies  --  is providing a panicked public with quick , accurate informadon . The main room , twenty-eight by fifty feet , lined with glass walls , maps , charts , and blackboards marked " Status " and " Deployment , " is essentially a communications center , filled with twenty-hutton telephones and radio consoles , including a setup to commandeer every municipal radio frequency . The Fire Department 's Operations Control Division headquarters is clown a long hall . It is an even more impressive room , two stories high , looking very much like the set of the television series " Star Trek . " Under a flashing " Quiet " light , men wearing white shirts , black pants , and ties sit in fivefoot-high rust-colored leather swivel chairs before peach-and-cream-colored keyboards , screens , and microphone consoles . Towering over them are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving colored lights that monitor equipment and personnel deployment . It was one of the most extraordinary rooms I have ever seen , but several people told me it does not work very well the equipment , they said , is always breaking down . Aboveground , the manipulation of the landscape was proceeding as usual , KFWB , an all-news radio station , was reporting that North Hollywood homeowners were protesting plans by MCA , Incorporated , to level three hills to provide flatland for parking and movie sets at its Universal City Studios . The company wanted to level sixty-seven acres , providing enough fill to cover a football field to a depth of eleven hundred and twenty-five feet . MCA , it was reported , was willing to give each of the homeowners six thousand dollars for their acquiescence . But one resident , identified as Billie Varga , was quoted as saying , " The hill we 're on is going to go if they take down that one over there . " Billie Varga said she was worried about " slide creep " the geological phenomenon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deck . AMONTH later , I was driving north along the Pacific Coast Highway to visit Helen Funkhouser , a seventy-six-year-old woman who had moved hack into the Santa Monica Mountains after losing her home in the Agoura fire of October 23 , 1978 . KFWB was reporting that twenty-seven hundred acres were burning near Pasadena . I passed a steel wall being constructed in what used to he one lane of the highway . The wall is supposed to hold hack the crumbling , sliding palisades above Malibu . Then I turned into Kanan-flume Road , past a sign that said : KANAN-DUME ROAD SLIDE REMOVAL AREA UP TO 20 MIN DELAYS 8:30 A.M. TO 4 P.M. WEEKDAYS Mrs. Funkhouser is an impressive woman . She was a state legislator in New Hampshire before coming to California , in 1961 , with her husband , James , a chemistry professor . They were reading in the ten-foot-wide ' nubile-home units they had bought to replace their house  --  two were attached , to give them twenty feet of width  --  when I arrived at their isolated home-site , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Santa Monicas meet the Pacific . " We heat the fire by five minutes , " Mrs. Funkhouser said . " 1 , Ve lost everything . Paintings , books , antiques . But Jim did manage to get his cello . We thought we would be safe , because we had built a system literally pouring water on every bit of the house and property , but they say the temperature of the fire was between twenty-five hundred and three thousand degrees . Here . This was my chicken-cooking pot . " Jim Funkhouser handed me a flattened blob of aluminum . " It takes a certain kind of person to live here , " she said . " We came hack . We all came back . We 're damn fools , but the trees come back , and so do we . It 's a constant battle . Nature keeps trying to take over here . But it 's beautiful , and it 's where we want to be . "
