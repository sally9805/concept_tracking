The Poems of Allen Grossman - This is our sixth of a number of presentations at poets and essays on poets . Allen Grossman 's first book ants A Harlot 's Hire , published by Walker-de Berry , Inc. in 196 I , his second The Recluse , published by the Pyrn Randall Press in 1965 . AU of the poems here are taken with his permission from And the Dew Lay All Night upon my Branch , a selection privately printed by the author at Brandeis University , ? Allen Grossman , 7974 .

The Unfinished Man Lhe fleeing forests of the mystic winter Cast shadows on my children at their play . This April is as cold as summer 's end ; It is like a young man 's mind or like a girl 's Wasting passion on the thought of death . I had hoped for greater certitude than this Hard sentence written in the spring : The kabbalist is not a married man Nor is he rabbi who has forked himself In children . The God of the created world Is April 's hostage as am 1 . Therefore , Let us begin our meditation on This evil and uncertain weather . Like birds out of a solitary Oak My children rose who now in April 's evening With sweet unsettled cries return to rest . We are shards of one majestic being Which dreams of its own beauty in the spring As of its own recurrent shapes the sea Is never satisfied . Love shattered us And shook us into such separate being As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once God on an evening Searched for his own image in the garden . Regard this Oak , late flowering and latest To lay down its leaves , God 's tree , despising change . Great angel of my birth , . ind you , father , Beast of my begetting , leave me now . My grief demands a solemn loneliness Allow me in my thirtieth year to claim freedom , An unfinished man haunted by phantoms of the threshold . There is no time , being no longer young , For more thoughts than one ; I shall hereafter have one thought alone : I shall bind it in mysterious ways upon my forehead And shall contrive to have it always Before my eyes , The sign of it Will be upon the door-post of my house And beyond that blazoned in the mansions of my sleep : The Recluse I. y life is bountiful , although I dwell Absurdly in it . I am a bird disgracing This most lovely tree by my poor plumage , Half grown and badly worn as if unowned . About me grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of God . On this white tree amid blue flowers of air I am the only thing improbable . To my own senses I am all unreal . This bright world lacing and unlacing Can not create me in another sense But stares out of its luminous blue eyes Unwondering at my wind-eaten wings . II . I live beside a stream that does not flow , And I have grown as still as my profound And household river . I am as cold as ice And do not know how light inhabits me Making my heart a crystal cave , untenanted By anything but glory . I do well know That underneath , the sea searches the stream And claims it , beyond all power to contain Its meanings , or withhold its tearless well From ocean 's fields made barren by the rock The name of which is Niobe-of-tears . And by this sign I know that I shall love Again , and thereby grow both swift and dark . III . My house is older than my life and therefore A continual instruction . Through it Pours the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I read in Ovid at my table How men were changed from being men To something less deceivable , and I Am changed by solitude until the light Lives through me and my body is no more A breeder of shadow . On darker days The rain inhabits me , dim without sorrow And chill without love . From my reverie Woodpeckers wake me with their stony bills Searching in the rotten walls for food . IV . In especial I am haunted by Apollo Who loved Daphne , Daphne who became A tree . I follow her across the fields Crying , " I am the god of wisdom offering Knowledge of the past , and of the present And of what from the dark source beyond us Is yet to flow . " And I too see her run , With the dark certitude of a natural thing Knowing this is not love , whatever Love may be , that at her back cries out , " I am a god . " Her father was a river In the vale of Tempe , who changed her Into laurel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chimney And makes a phantom fire with the roaring Of its wings , stirring the ashes on the stone In the act of comforting . I warm myself At night beside this fire , and listen to The song in the nest that floats above me like The sea that lives and does not live in shells . And who will tell me that I do not pray ( Being unfashionable ) with the profoundest right Of a deserted man to that vague thing Which has usurped my empty hearth and altar And is a common bird , and yet unknown To me except by cries , and by the breath of wings ? VI . Wild iris , the hidden violet , and clover And a dozen jewels nameless to me Rise in the rank pasture by the river . What is more real ? And these too evening Encompasses , and night devours altogether . Fireflies remember the nightly death Of flowers , luring the wanderer by the river Tranced in the fire of memory and the dew To consecrate himself to quest for those Ten thousand grails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am the beast rather Seen by Gahereth drinking of the river From whose belly issued the cry of dogs . VII . Much has been said in dispraise of memory And I deny it all . I shall not live In this place long ? the meditation On the signs and sacred images of desire Must have an end . This place I shall revisit On the shrunken stream in autumn , coming up The current in an old tin boat to where My house untenanted is hid by fainting blooms Suffered by summer to grow much too long . And I will greet the god of the place With temperate rejoicing and call him by the name I knew when last I loved ? and for the dance The hamadryads will forsake their trees . What is this wind which twists all , Letting nothing be final or blooming , But all , at once , rooted and wandering ? Is this the hour and the minute of the end , When the gigantic oak goes straying on the land And streams withdraw to caverns underground ? Far inland I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees As on the uninhabitable sea ; And I am paralyzed with loneliness And can not think except to cry aloud Holds the wide world any slim and glittering thing For which my heart 's need has not a use and gratefulness . The Poetry of Allen Grossman Allen Grossman seems to me among the best , and the least known , of the middle generation of American poets : the generation of Ashbery and Merwin and lames Wright . He is almost nowhere to be found in the anthologies , an honorable exception being John Hollander 's Poems of Our Moment . Yet he has three books ; his first and most generous volume ( A Harlot 's Hire . 1961 ; now out of print ) was by any reckoning very accomplished ; his neglect , compared with the thriving fortunes of talents far more slender , looks like an unlucky accident of fashion At a time when the public taste is shifting away from confessional verse and other journalistic modes , a poet such as Grossman might be expected to command a steady audience . For he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known , now and then on a strident note , everywhere in his poetry , and what he means by it seems to be this : " The origin of poetic authority is always , 1 venture to say , the Wisdom tradition , which is not religion or thought but the sense of the self in the highest mode imaginable . " The sentence is from Grossman 's study of The Wind among the Reeds ( Poetic Knowledge in the ' Early Yeats , 1969 ) . And it has the austerity of moral purpose that one associates with Wordsworth 's great Preface . That Grossman is indeed one of those who , in speaking truly for themselves , speak for others as well , the selection printed here will show . You find him at his own highest reach in " The Recluse " and " The Unfinished Man . " The author of " The Recluse , " who is the hermit , who is the representative poet or scholar of nature and nature 's signs , learns of hivself by living apart from the world . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch . On this white tree amid blue flowers of air I am the only thing improbable . And , having fled the chaos of ordinary life , he lacks the toughness of that which he has renounced , and the grandeur of that which he would accept . The created glory of nature can not be compassed in song : it will not suffer the embrace . He makes his song therefore of humility . This bright world lacing and unlacing Can not create ? in another sense But stares out of its luminous blue eyes Unwondering at my wind-eaten wings . Thus he admits the reign not only of nature but of man-made things . My house is older than my life and therefore A continual instruction . And he contrasts his own solitude with the superb animation of figures in the greater mythologies : he thinks of Daphne . And I too see her run With the dark certitude of a natural thing Knowing this is not love , whatever Love may be , that at her back cries out , " 1 am a god. - The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nature he beholds ? something mysterious nesting in the chimney , fireflies haunting the night air ? at any rate these are k he poet 's examples : they might be anything . They make the hermit 's dwelling with himself suffice , and his hymn to memory ? the powerful cadence that begins " Much has been said in dispraise of memory/ And I deny it all " ? comes to rest in a curiously modest version of solipsism . Far inland I behold the driven gull Afloat upon the frothing crests of trees As on the uninhabitable sea ; And I am paralyzed with loneliness And can not think except to cry aloud Holds the wide world any slim and glittering thing For which my heart 's need has not a use and gratefulness . " Authority " belongs to the poet who , having tried to learn all , knows that he has found only the limits of his self-knowledge . They are his all . l count " The Recluse " among the most perfect lyrics in American poetry of the last two decades . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad weather of early spring galvanizes the speaker of this poem into a nervous kind of song , and the weather 's uncertainty makes him keenly aware that his life , in several aspects , is now balked in mid-passage . He is caught in a cycle of obligations , not properly isolate , and unable to find in love 's company the desired emblems of permanence . God , as in most of Grossman 's poems , is elsewhere and not to be bothered ? though , as master of nature , He too must be " April 's hostage . " The cry for a tentative freedom is what brings the unfinished man a temporary prospect beyond the weather . The world is stern , unfigured , without description , Containing no mystery or treasure . In it labour is lost , and love Cast out like wings upon the water without resting place . My plow prepares the winds , and my great horses Labour in the empty fields where no tree Shades the turning . More visionary than the hermit of " The Recluse , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not for a place of contemplation but for a final asceticism or a final union with things . He would be remembered as the man who pursued meditation Till in my purity I had become Perfectly accompanied or perfectly alone . Grossman 's poetry is addressed to the reader who can imagine how these two states might become one : this is his " one story and one story only . " Yet his work is remarkably varied . He writes the domestic or professorial complaint ( as in " The Cry , " where a wife 's sleepwalking brings the husband 's reply to a well-known devotional poem : " something not understood " ) . And in " Signs , " a poem explicitly prayer-like in its quest for God 's presence , his God speaks in a voice no one would mistake for human . Who am so skillful with you , you do not know . Lie down . You are not beautiful . But am strong . The known times did you no good at all . The night is full of flares . The night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You do not know . In a low sun the unsheltering great rains His most characteristic mode is perhaps the meditation on landscape . Touches in " Spring Song " are reminiscent of Frost ? the eye that " does not stop where the path has always ended/ But lingers beyond that someway on . " Grossman himself often stands out from the scene , off to one side , slightly bewildered . He can sound estranged in a way that is , if not peculiarly Jewish , at least peculiar and Jewish : so he reflects in " Amesbury , " " What 's Guinevere to the Jews ? A myth. / Something they would not think for themselves , " and wonders at the force of the light , " Making soft ridges in the ripening corn/ Which serve age after age to break the plow . " His style , always a marvel , has its sources . Frost is incidental . A more pervasive influence seems to be Lowell ? especially in Grossman 's early poems . " Depart. / The unpossessed live longest in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scythed and conquering chariots that deck/ The blackened street with roses " ? I have chosen the lines not quite at random , but they are unexceptionable Lowell of , say , the " Falling Asleep over the Aeneid " or " Beyond the Alps " phase . Still , this does not last long . " The wrong of unshapely things is a wrong too great to be told ; f I hunger to build them anew and sit on a green knoll apart " ? that , surely , is Grossman 's mature idiom . It is from Yeats ' " " The Lover Tells of the Rose in His Heart . " Grossman is enthralled to all that is vatic in this key , and it is here that he astonishes . In " The Pilgrims " his energy at simple utterance is unearthly . And it would be useless to say that the energy makes the poem , since this is a prophetic lament , and the energy is the poem . As one stone ' sleeps beneath the mill The other grinds the corn . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blake , or to the Emerson of " Bacchus " : " And the poor grass shall plot and plan/ What it will do when it is man . " Grossman rarely succumbs to the great temptation of the oracular tone , which is hysteria : in this respect he may be favorably compared with Ginsberg . He calls " Pain , " in a lovely but flawed poem , a gift of " unforgetting . " It is The faithful one , The testament , the witness , As of the leaves There is no summary . Only The autumn tipping them One after one Into the well of the wind . Grossman 's poems are all , in some way , painful acts of unforgetting , though their effect is never to irritate but to calm : as he astonishes he refreshes . And that after all is another way of naming the sublime in poetry . " Lilith " and " Tales of Odysseus " are MOV NG ?

Both have to be read as dramatic monologues : the trouble is that in the first the speech has been cut loose from the drama , and , what is more dismaying , in the second the speaker can not be surely identified as either Odysseus or the poet . They are strong poems nevertheless . Let one line Oh Tanager , first and last you are a slave to shadows ? serve as a touchstone of the poise and the eloquence they share . In contrast , Grossman 's most recent poems can seem sheer oddities : the least that can be said for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mannered . But , in judging his experiments , one must remember what an isolated figure he is . From this circumstance he has gained more than he has lost . What Grossman lacks , outside his best work , is a certain sense of compositional order : the sense that tells you what should go where , which things to leave Out , when to stop . He is among the few poets who seem to possess both the critical and the poetic faculty , but , in him , the two seem fairly discreet from each other . A poem with the refrain , Rockefeller and Kublai Khan are moving the trees around , is genuinely wild and unexpected . The benediction " As for the Towers , " where the title is repeated endlessly to make a hypnotic incantation , can not mean for most readers what it meant to the poet . Doubtless poetry aspires to a condition of pure incantation when it grows unhappy with itself as poetry . And yet this poet 's many inventions have yielded him a singular triumph . He wrote a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up into the tower. / There will be sunlight like a downward fire , " and from the memory of this earlier poem came " The Turning Tree .

Is there a reader would not take this for his epitaph ? David Bromwich David Bromwich is a poet and critic and a graduate student at Yale . Books Considered Selected Poems by Robert Creeley ( Scribners ; $7 05 , $3.95 paperback ) From the very first , with the publication of For Love : Poems 7950-1960 , Robert Creeley declared himself an experimenter : his interest has not been primarily in either ideas or in things , but in allowing what is there to be expressed in words , in sounds and rhythms that communicate states of mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For Creeley , rhythmic modality is the very essence of poetry ; he has never been interested in subordinating his art to statements of a social or political nature , nor has he been interested in developing form per se . He follows William Carlos Williams : " The poet thinks with his poem . in that lies his thought , and that in itself is the profundity . " Had Creeley not gone on to become a quite substantial poet he would have achieved a sort of minor celebrity in poetry circles by having stated a truth there to be expressed , so Far as contemporary poets are concerned : " Form is never more than an extension of content . " The Selected Poems is a surprisingly slender book , omitting much good material ; apart from a superb longer poem " For My Mother : Genevieve Jules Creeley , April 8 , 1887 ?
