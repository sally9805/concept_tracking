CARRYING THE FIRE <P> by MICHAEL COLLINS <P> 478 pages . Farrar , Straus &; Giroux. $10 . <P> <P> One of the lessons that many former U.S. astronauts apparently learned during their training was how to land on their feet . A good number are now well-paid public relations vice presidents of business firms . Alan Shepard grew rich in real estate ; John Glenn has a good chance of becoming U.S. Senator from Ohio next November ; Richard Gordon is an executive with the New Orleans Saints football team ; and Edgar Mitchell runs an outfit for the study of extrasensory perception . <P> Then there is Michael Collins , the man most likely to be forgotten as the pilot of the Apollo 11 mother ship that circled the moon while fellow astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first human beings to take an extraterrestrial walk . Now a brigadier general ( U.S. Air Force , ret . ) , Collins is director of the Smithsonian 's Air and Space Museum , which will soon house flying relics from the earliest balloons through Skylab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Many harbored childhood memories of their fathers looking for work during the Depression , or of no money for the movies . Mike was born in Rome , where his father was U.S. military attach . By the time Mike was graduated from West Point in 1952 his father was a retired two-star general , his older brother was a colonel , and his uncle , J. Lawton ( " Lightnin ' Joe " ) Collins , was Army Chief of Staff . <P> In his self-effacing autobiography , Collins tells how he sidestepped Army nepotism by joining the Air Force . He became a hot-shot test pilot , was married , and eventually filtered through the rigorous screening process to find his way into the glamorous arms of NASA . This account of Collins ' early training and the moon mission adds up to the best-written book yet by any of the astronauts . <P> Collins is both substantive and witty . He is also generous with his praise and fairly candid about his dislikes . Neil Armstrong , who now teaches engineering at the University of Cincinnati , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perspective . " Frank Borman , now a vice president at Eastern Airlines , " makes decisions faster than anyone I have ever met . " Collins is awed by his Gemini 10 partner John Young , a country boy whose " aw shucks , ' t ai nt nothing " demeanor masks a brilliant engineering mind . <P> Carrying the Fire displays less tolerance for some of the others , notably the Apollo 7 crew : " Wally Schirra was late every morning , never apologized , and never tried to catch up with the schedule but wasted instead another 45 minutes on guffaws , coffee and war stories . . . Walt Cunningham bitched constantly , at Wally and the world , and Donn Eisele served as a good-natured referee who did n't quite understand what was going on half the time . "
