a story by Forrest Scarborough THE PLACE TO BE El1RST OF ALL you must picture my condition . 11 Breathing is difficult with my knees against my chin . And talking to the air is distracting . I am used to a typewriter . But before wedging myself in here I started the tape recorder and must now make the best of it . There is no chance of escape . Ideally I would prefer to organize the material and depart with sonic assurance that my predicament is explicable . Not that it matters , of course . No more than anything else . I shall try not to be morbid but offer dollops of sensation to catch the jaded coroner . Picture me on the nose of thirty . Or as the passport says , " 6 feet , blond hair , blue eyes . Expiration date November 29 . " Not that I feel under any constraint to obey the date . Pure coincidence . Unless in my final madness I overturn the prison and pause another day . But I am as immobilized as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The passport picture shows a beard , but neatly trimmed , and hair long enough to drape nature 's lapses . I am benignly stoned , graying at the temples and tired to death , caught in a reverie of far places and imminent disillusionment . Is Ausxalia the answer ? But first the scene . I am lecturing to a sparsely aopulated hall of freshmen suffering pangs of - elevancy . But in the primary stages . Not yet ; eneralized to include themselves , much less the ong train that follows in order . The disease is ' irulent , you know . Miss Pomfret is sneering in the front row . The urly Mr. Abbott has gathered a derisive follow-rig in the rear of the hall . I have heard but hoose to ignore an unguarded " bullshit " to my ight . Great movements are afoot at the ROTC uniting . But I am saying , " The literary symbol a condensation of complexities which are ireducible to conventional verbal expression . " I m proceeding to my tired example of the great white whale , when in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a dud firecracker is followed by billowing noxious vapors . A bomb , of course . Imagine the pandemonium . Freshmen are battling from the billows . Desks are hurled aside and stumbled over . But I have been observing Mr. Abbott , and I descend upon him through a fog of sulphur dioxide , surmounting callow girls . I catch him midway in his flight . I grapple at beads and fringe , tear fetishes and talismans , until I have him by the throat . I dash him to the floor . " It 's a symbol ! " he cries . Hands tear at me . Somebody shrieks , " It 's only a stinkbomb ! " But I have his throat . He is waxing blue . Screams . General discordance . Others rush in . Some flee . But I now have a hank of Mr. Abbott 's hair of a prophet clutched in my fist . I would have it still if I had not forgot and left it on the department head 's desk when he suggested that I needed a long rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hank of hair , whipping it against my leg at Doctor Garard 's desk , while he shakes his gray cropped head . superannuated by the times , and says , " What are we to do with you , Doctor Booth ? " " What shall we ever do ? I shall rush into the street as I am , with my hair down . So . " He says . " Approximate Eliot , I believe , " and tells me that the sociology department is furious that I have mutilated one of their most p ? romisinc , young people . But I am unregenerate . Even after charges are preferred . And even after I am committed for observation . So , you see , there are grounds for suspecting my sanity . And any tinge of universality in my tale can be easily disregarded . I wonder why I am bothering , stuffed in here , already craving a drink of water and babbling to the air . No matter . They did n't realize , you see , that I was not completely cooperative , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unguarded moment  --  I would fly the coop , so to speak , with illusions of escape , and discover myself driving over the prairies and across the Great Plains , on westward to find the unspoiled land . I want to he born anew . Or does that set you into a storm of hilarity ? I cross the Rockies and follow the Snake into Oregon . Heavy mists baptize me in the Columbia gorge . I am calmer . I even consider forgetting the plan that has been in my mind all along . It is too extreme . Perhaps I do not need a cabin at the end of the longest dead-end road in an Oregon wilderness . But in Portland the crowd on the street channels me back into the car . I am again on tiptoe for a flight . I leave without directions , lose myself on viaducts and soaring bridges , chain-smoking into the foothills of the Cascades . And only then does my heart stop racing . Have you felt it yourself ? And sometimes , in your concrete canyons , do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a vale of ferns ? Or see from your log-cabin porch tall firs through a break of alder ? If so , see the Reverend Jeremiah Trimble who dabbles in real estate . But know what you are looking for . " Uh huh , " he says to rne . " Just what everybody else is looking for . Drawn by my sign , were n't you ? Do you pray ? " Do I pray ? I would pray unceasingly if ... Well , think . Would I not spend my final hours addressing an instrument more responsive than a tape recorder ? I dodge the question and congratulate him on his sign , which says in bold vermilion : GOD 'S LAND FOR SALE OR RENT . SEE HIS SERVANT JEREMIAH TRIMBLE . " The Lord and me have come to an agreement . Hop right in . " He takes me in his car past strawberry fields , through orchards of grazing cows . " All of it 's the Lord 's land . I take 6 per cent commission . No more nor less . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through cedar and sword fern . turns up a rutted dirt road , and conies to a stop on a log bridge over a creek . " There ' t is , " he says . " Only log cabin around here for rent . Vacant since last winter . Payable monthly . Owner lives up the hill yonder . Never takes notice . Just what you asked for . End of a dead-end road , uh huh . I could rent out a hundred before nightfall . " S O I AM HERE . And at night in the sleeping loft , with raindrops on cedar shakes and the creek freshening for the fall coho , it is almost enough . Or it was . My life has crept so long on a broken wing Thro ' cells of madness , haunts of horror and fear , That come to be grateful at last for a little t Or does my necessary omission of cumulative distress make the quotation in context a bit over . stated ? No doubt . But we are talking about me after all : one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the type . He overreacts . He moves in jerks . His eyes fast alarm . One day you hear that he has bombe ( the post office . Or perhaps he disappears alto gether . Like me , content for the rest of the summer tt sit on the porch with a book in my lap , marvelim at water ouzels or the sharp complaint of king fishers flashing by . I take long walks in the woods . I read all of Trollope and miss no one Yet sometimes above me on the hill behind the cabin I hear a bulldozer straining . Some times I think I hear the greedy bite of chai : saws . One day in early fall there conies up the roa ? an octogenarian who once did props fur Th Wizard of Oz . He introduces himself as H. Dunkel and says , " Jeremiah Trimble passed thi off as a dead end , I 'll wager . But break throug that brush yonder and follow the path on up , an that 's another way to the dump , young man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought this was the end . " He chuckles . " Naw , there 's a lot more than this . Follow the path up some day . Or wait till the leaves fall . You 'll come to a high hedge of rhodies . Behind that 's the dump . " I invite him in . We sit by a fire of split alder and I answer his questions about the world outside , which he dismisses with a wave of his hand . He says , " You rented this place cheap , I expect . Schoolteacher ? I figured so . Met your landlord yet ? " " I pay Jeremiah Trimble . " " Just a servant , " he says . " a middleman . Your landlord 's up there . " He points up the hill . " Rufus Snethers . Owns the dump . That 's your landlord , and everybody ease 's landlord around here . Very remote character . Out of sight every time you need him . But that 's life , eh ? " " That 's life , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best thing , " he says , " when you 're dealing with a maniac . " He has dropped his volume and seems uneasy . Then he says , " It 's a small valley here . Do n't get around much myself . I 'm retired . " He chuckles . " Like you , I expect . Trying not to be noticed . " He tells me that he lives down the road with his widowed daughter . " We get a lot of schoolteachers on the run around here . Last fellow stayed in this cabin was a schoolteacher . Or used to be . I reckon Jeremiah Trimble did n't let on about him . That 's why you got the place cheap , though . Young fellow about your age , cone from somewhere back East . Never said much . Looked out the window with big eyes every time somebody walked up this way . Got to be a topic of conversation . " Shakes his head . " A bad business . " But I want to know nothing about it . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groceries and come back quickly . There is no radio , no television . I receive no mail or newspaper . There is nothing but the tranquil present and the - :arefully chosen world of my reading . I am dis.iplining myself toward Pollyanna . I say , " Do , ' ou take an interest in botany , Mr. Dunkel ? " " That 's about all I am interested in , " he says . 13larits wo n't turn on you . They 're predictable . " - le continues at length , giving me the Latin for ight indigenous mosses in the genus sphagnum . I am relieved that the relationship has asumcd a sane footing . " We 'll talk more , " he says . " But I 'll be geting up the road now . " T HE LEAVES CHANGE COLOR , and on clear nights I stand among the trees and look at lie Milky Way . Silence . I have left behind every ngine and siren in the world . But during the day I pause and listen . A tree falling . Then another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Mr. Dunkel on his ext trip up the road . " That 's chain saws , all ght . " He tells me more about bryophytes . One morning , out of a thicket of Himalaya berries , an antlered buck breaks toward me , banks in terror and plunges off down the creek . I have seen his eyes . Up the hill I hear shooting . " The fashion , " Mr. Dunkel says , " is to shoot a buck . Then shoot a rabbit . The taxidermist mounts the rack on the rabbit 's head , and the hunter hangs it over his fireplace . They get a laugh out of that . But you asked me about liverworts . " That night , with fall merging into winter , dark clouds march up the creek and the wind howls until morning . When I go outside in the drizzle , I see that the leaves have been stripped away . And through gray skeletons , past great Douglas firs , up the hill I see a hedge of rhododendrons . Something is behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sound but can not see it . The creek has risen and salmon are struggling against red silt . " Silt 's had , " Mr. Dunkel says , " Clogs their gills . That batch wo n't spawn . " He finds me in the yard by the creek . " Man-made silt , " he says . " The saws sound closer today . " We go to the house , but he pauses in the doorway and looks up the hill at the rhododendrons for a moment . I give him some coffee . He comes to the table . He looks older and cradles the warmth of the cup in both hands . I get up and go to the window . The hedge is thrashing now , caught in a gale . But the air is still . He says , " Take a final look . Rufus Snethers is having another spell . " " What does that mean ? " " Just about anything . Doctor . He 's arbitrary . Might as well just have a seat . " But what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breathe . I return to the table and say , " What am Ito expect ? What ? " He stares at the floor . " Lord knows , " he says . " It 's Snethers ' land . Seen a lot of this in my time . Tired of it . Just plain tired . " He sighs , looks around and focuses on the corner by the sink . " What 's that doing there ? Ought to been thrown out . " " What ? " " The garbage can . And I know what that sonofabitch Snethers said , damn his soul , in that sanctimonious whine of his . Either screaming or whining . Said , ' Plenty use in it yet , ' and put it right hack where it was . A bad business . A galvanized coffin . " " The garbage can ? " He is impatient . But outside , before he has found words , tearing through vine maple and alder in its fall , a Douglas fir crashes to the ground and brings us to our feet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . " I heard the saw , but I did n't figure it was that close . " We go outside and look at the top branches stretching down the hill and into the yard . I start to speak , but the rhododendron hedge gives way and a Caterpillar bulldozer crawls over it , pushing on its blade a mound of garbage that cascades down the hill in an avalanche of cans , bottles , and frantic rats . High on the machine sits a shriveled creature with red hair and a face distorted by rage . The machine pauses and withdraws for another lunge . Comes on again , thwarted by a heavy clump of maples . And above the roar of the diesel , a mighty voice : " Move , goddamn you ! Useless bastard ! Move , goddammit ! " Withdraws and lunges again , overpowering the maples , tearing the ferns , laying its steel track on toward us . Mr. Dunkel says , " The sonofabitch , the dirty sonofabitch . " And coming on in crazed omnipotence , the head of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Shouts , " Get out the way ! Go on . move it ! " " Better step aside , " Mr. Dunkel says . " He 's having another spell , the sonofabitch . Do n't say nothing to him . " The machine sinks in the sodden grass but grinds forward and comes to a halt by the cabin . The last of the garbage drops from its blade . The engine idles . " What are you doing ? " I say . I am trying to shout , but there is not enough air . " Can I do anything ? Can I make you stop ? " He is clothed in a slicker and rain pants . He appears amphibian , but not of this world . His rage now turns to a sneer , and he says . " It 'll take a damned sight more than your prayers or your offerings . I got plans , you see . Always did have . And I 'm putting them to work . " His age is indeterminate , but I have the feeling that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the way down this hill . " " To the cabin , you mean ? " " Over the cabin , sonny . And where the dump stops is where my subdivision starts . Everything is going to get developed . I own it all . Every tree , every field and creek . And what I say goes . " He guns the engine and shouts at Mr Dunkel , " You still hanging on ? I thought yot died . " He locks a track and swivels the machim around . " It 's all in the plan ! " He grinds over t clump of fruited holly . " Be seeing you ! " I look at Mr. Dunkel . He looks at me . " Wha now ? " I ask . " God knows , " lie says . We go back into the cabin . F OR A LONG TIME WE SIT and say nothing , lis tening to the machine straining back am forth on the hill . I do not go to the window . know the garbage is against the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a customary futilit saps me . " And the sonofabitch kept the can , " Mr. Dun kel says . " The garbage can ? " " That one there . It 's the wrong time to d sem it . " " It does n't matter . " " No , it does n't matter . You 're right . Thf young fellow lived here before you . I found hit in it . After some time . " I look at the can . " Wedged his rear end right down in it . Pinne his hands under . Wedged in and could n't out . Could n't move . A bad business . " I stare at the can . " Something else . Had a book open on tl table there . Book on ESP . " " Trying to communicate , " I say . " Wonder if he got through ? " I doubt it . " Mr. Dunkel says , " Big mess in all the paper Case was closed . " I say nothing . " You 'll be moving on , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell him . " Well , I 'll be getting on up the road now . " " Good luck , Mr. Dunkel . " And I am here . Have I made myself clear ? It somehow seems the place to be . Not original . But appropriate .
