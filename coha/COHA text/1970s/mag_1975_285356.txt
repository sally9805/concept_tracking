President Ford looked trim and rested , his face surprisingly unlined , as he met with members of TIME 'S editorial staff " in the Oval Office last week . He sat easily in an armchair , cupping an unlit pipe in his left hand , and answered questions on energy and economic policy , foreign affairs and the demands of presidential leadership . In several areas , he was clearly still in the process of formulating his State of the Union program . The questions were asked by Managing Editor Henry Grunwald , Chief of Correspondents Murray Gart , Washington Bureau Chief Hugh Sidey and White House Correspondents Bonnie Angela and Dean Fischer . Excerpts from the exchange : <P> <P> Q. What went wrong with your earlier economic program that makes you feel you need a new program ? <P> <P> A. We went through a long , I think , constructive process of economic summit , culminating in a program which we felt at that time would meet the primary threat of the problem of inflation . I thought it was well tuned to meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of economic stability . <P> But all of the economists that I have talked to , including the ones here and some from Western Europe , have indicated to me that they did not foresee the precipitous drop , particularly in the automotive field . Of course , that has been told to me very directly by the automotive manufacturers . There was a rapidly developing and certainly unforeseen massive loss of public confidence . When you combined all of those , the plan we had was n't adequate and it was n't properly balanced . <P> We have had to restudy conditions as we see them now and as we foresee them , and the new plan is aimed at the current circumstances rather than what the circumstances were in August and September . It is just an updating for the current conditions , conditions which were unforeseen and are far , far more serious . <P> <P> Q. What is the shape of your energy proposals ? <P> <P> A. We have had the benefit of massive , year-long study . The energy program is the pulling together of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In addition , we find that the voluntary program has not been as successful as it should be . Although for the first nine or ten months of this year we were using energy-either energy as a whole or imports-at a rate of about 5.4% less than ' 73 , in the last several months it has gone about 5% ahead of a year ago . A year ago we were importing about 6 million barrels per day . Now we are importing about 7 million barrels per day . This proves to me that a voluntary program is n't sufficient . <P> <P> Q. Is this failure of voluntary effort a disappointment ? <P> <P> A. It is a disappointment , but I think understandable . Everybody had ample gasoline , or even in some selected areas price wars , which certainly is not an indication of any lack of supply . What I am saying is , that the American people do n't respond unless they see firsthand a crisis . Now , that may come . If we get some of these natural-gas shortages , which are inevitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have a hard winter , then again that crisis will be thrown at the American people and maybe a voluntary program will be regenerated . <P> <P> Q. Can you foresee rationing under any circumstances ? <P>
