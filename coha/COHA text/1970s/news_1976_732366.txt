txt Rep. Bob Michel R. , Peoria charged Monday that numerous assassination attempts , including one in which a " local citizen " was killed , have occurred after the identification of American officials abroad as members of the Central Intelligence Agency . " The attack on Richard Welch was not an isolated case , " Michel said before the House , referring to the CIA station chief slain last December in Athens . Michel said that the CIA in Washington informed him of several subsequent assassination attempts , including one " close call " in which an ambush was laid for an American official described in a foreign journal as a CIA officer . THE ATTEMPT , according to Michel , occurred in an area where terrorist groups have been active . But Michel explained that he was barred from saying more about the location . " It is unimportant whether that embassy official actually was or was not a CIA officer . The fact that he was alleged to be a CIA officer led to his being marked for assassination by a terrorist squad , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The American officer was not entrapped in the ambush ; however , a local citizen was slain . " SOURCES SAID the gunfire intended for the American missed , and instead brought down a man who may have been one of the terrorists . Michel said the CIA had told him there were other reports of bombing attempts , plots , and threats on the lives of persons identified as intelligence personnel . " Nor have families of those pinpointed been spared , " he said . " In one country , the local authorities found an extremist with photographs of the little children of one of the men identified . " MICHEL INTRODUCED a bill last month providing a maximum 10-year prison term and $10,000 fine for identifying " one who at any time has been or is presently engaged in . . . intelligence operations . " The bill , which has attracted 43 cosponsors , was drawn up after the slaying of Welch , who was identified in several journals and a book as a CIA officer . Michel also said on Jan. 30 the acting CIA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him of other similar episodes after he had requested the information from the CIA . Welch was murdered Dec. 23 outside his home in Athens . The CIA has blamed the death on his Identification as a CIA officer by a group known as Fifth Estate , which publishes a magazine called Countery-Spy.
