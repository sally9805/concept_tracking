Fitfully , Richard Nixon slumbers . In dream review , his White House predecessors flicker past . There is Woodrow Wilson , railing against the Senate 's " little group of willful men . " He dissolves to Andrew Jackson , censured by the Senate for removing deposits from the Bank of the United States without authority . F.D.R. , his aplomb punctured by a Senate that thwarted his attempt to pack the Supreme Court , snaps in and out of focus . Finally Lyndon Johnson , hounded from office amid the taunts of Senate doves , looms up . <P> President Nixon tosses , turns . The pantheon of the past retreats . Now it is 1971 . From his Oval Office , Nixon sends to the Senate the nomination of a Mississippi judge for the Supreme Court . Zap ! Confirmed . He asks $10 billion for an expanded ABM system . Pow ! Appropriated . He proposes cuts in school funds . Chop ! Done . In one corner of his dream stands a forlorn J. William Fulbright , talking while no one listens . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toppled by a Republican capture of the Senate . In a far recess of the Senate chamber , a vestigial cluster of radic-libs cowers as a troglodytic terrorizer in tailored twill cracks a whip over their heads . At last the President slips into the sleep of serenity and contentment . <P> IF asleep he may dream his Improbable Dream , the waking Richard Nixon is increasingly unsparing of himself , his Vice President , his Cabinet and the enormous , varied and subtle resources of his office . Coming down the stretch toward Nov. 3 and the 1970 election , the President has taken active as well as strategic command of the campaign he began outlining more than a year ago . Nixon has found the liberal Senate to be his most embarrassing and implacable opponent ; on one issue and appointment after another , the Senate has plagued his policies and thwarted his choices . Thus while 33 governorships are up for grabs as well as all 435 seats in the House of Representatives , it is the battle for the 35 Senate seats being contested this year that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minimal influence on gubernatorial races . Nor do the Republicans expect to do more than hold their own in the House of Representatives , where they have 188 seats to 243 for the Democrats ( there are four vacancies ) . More than 90% of House incumbents who seek reelection , following recent patterns , can be expected to win ; traditionally the President 's party loses seats in the House in off-year elections . So as G.O.P. National Chairman Rogers C.B. Morton says : " This year the name of the game is the Senate . " <P> It is the costliest senatorial election in the nation 's history ( estimated outlay : $65 million ) , one of the most bitterly fought and from all appearances , likely to be the closest since 1954 , when Democrats won control by a single vote . <P> As of last week , Nixon had already committed himself to go stumping in 21 states . This schedule constitutes the most extensive effort any President has ever undertaken in an off-year election . Flying out of Washington on Air Force One , Nixon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in just one day . And in a frenetic Saturday-through-Tuesday extended weekend , he also was due at rallies in Ohio , North Dakota , Missouri , Indiana , Tennessee and North Carolina . <P> At every stop , Nixon pushed forward Republican candidates , lifted
