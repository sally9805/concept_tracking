It was 7:15 on a balmy evening in the California town of San Jose , and families sat together watching TV . A lot of them were tuned in to local station KNTV , an ABC affiliate , to watch an old Peter Sellers movie , The Bobo , and many simply thought the flick was continuing when a light baritone voice intoned : " To everything there is a season ... " Then the camera panned over a young man and woman running along a beach sporting conspicuous wedding rings . " The makers of Trojans condoms believe there is a time for children ... the right time ... when they are wanted . " <P> Condoms ? Befuddled brains adjusted to the first-ever condom commercial on U.S. television . Viewers grabbed their phones . The KNTV switchboard was jammed all night . Unlike the vast majority of stations around the country , KNTV does not adhere to the National Association of Broadcasters ' stuffy code of ethics , which bans over-the-counter contraceptive commercials . But it had aired the Trojans ad only after testing it on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Catholic and a Baptist , all of whom found it inoffensive . After the viewer protests , however , KNTV General Sales Manager Jack Yearwood pulled the spot off the air . <P> Mixed Feelings . Not for long . The next day , area newspapers picked up the condom contretemps , and the issue gained the gloss of a civil liberties controversy . KNTV even found itself reporting the fuss , and aired the beach spot during its news broadcast . It then asked for viewers ' opinions . The change of heart was instant : 8 to 1 in the commercial 's favor . Some viewers were eager to complain about the ads they thought more offensive , like bad-breath treatments and sinus aids . <P> That is just how Youngs Drug Products Corp. , the makers of Trojans , feel , so they were delighted last week to see KNTV reinstate their spots . For them , KNTV is a beacon of sorts . They hope local stations ' acceptance will soften up the networks . Now it seems , resistance has begun to crack . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running the ads . As for KNTV , it views its pioneering role with mixed feelings . Says Yearwood : " It 's a hell of a claim to fame accepting the first rubber commercial . "
