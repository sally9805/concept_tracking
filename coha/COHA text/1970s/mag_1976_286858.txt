Is President Ford 's idea of a taste treat a dollop of horseradish sandwiched between two thick slabs of Bermuda onion ? Was a certain Southern Congressman pinched for making an illegal proposition to a plainclothes Washington policewoman ? Did Ethel Kennedy playfully run her white convertible over the curb in front of the Senate Office Building and nearly cancel Pedestrian Roger Mudd of CBS ? <P> The answer is yes , or so says The Ear . Since its first appearance ten months ago in the Washington Star , this brassy if not classy daily oracle has become the most talked-about gossip column in a town that takes chitchat to heart . The Ear draws more phone calls and mail than any feature in the paper and is cited as a factor in the financially troubled Star 's 6% circulation gain over a year ago. * " The wickedest thing to hit Washington since the last Administration , " wrote one fan . " You 're a dirty fun of a snitch , " said another . A local socialite is planning an " Ear Ball " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gold-colored ear-shaped pin to all whose names have appeared , and some capital notables , including Presidential Assistant William Seidman and Iranian Ambassador Ardeshir Zahedi , have worn these badges of celebrity in their lapels . <P> The Ear is getting a hearing outside of Washington , too . It now appears in 60 mostly medium-size dailies whose editors sense an appetite among readers for capital chatter . " New York 's Great White Way is not so bright and glittering any more , " says Bill Bondurant , managing editor of the Fort Lauderdale News . " The center of gossip today is Washington . " <P> The worst kept secret in Washington is the identity of the supposedly anonymous authors of The Ear , Diana McLellan , 38 , and Louise Lague , 28 , both Star feature-story writers . Mc-Lellan , a perky Englishwoman who came to the U.S. 19 years ago , and Lague , a tall ( 5 ft. 8 in . ) , Rhode Island-born former reporter for the now defunct Washington Daily News , stay out of the limelight . Unlike other professional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at fashionable restaurants . Their first trip together to swank Sans Souci got them , in Lague 's phrase , a table in " Haute Siberia . " " Our work is done on the phone , " says she . " We check our items . We do n't run rumor , and we do n't run anything we do n't think is true . " <P> What Perks . The Ear does run , with unflagging good humor and no apparent qualm , numerous corrections . Says Washington Post Executive Editor Ben Bradlee : " It 's highly unprofessional and highly readable . " <P> Bradlee should know , for nothing perks The Ear more than a chance to mention the O.P. ( Other Paper , i.e. , the Post ) , and the Fun Couple ( Bradlee and his roommate-reporter , Sally Quinn ) . Bradlee has said he would fire any Post staffer caught whispering to The Ear ( " I 'd consider it a conflict of interest " ) , but O.P. items keep coming . The only success Bradlee has had in plugging The Ear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who dreamed up the feature and watches over it carefully , wanted to run a column to which the Post had rights . Bradlee assented , provided The Ear not mention the Fun Couple for a month . Exactly one month later , Ben and Sally were items again .
