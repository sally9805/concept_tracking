THERE SEEMS OFTEN TO BE a playfulness to wise people , as if either their equanimity has as its source this playfulness or the playfulness flows from the equanimity ; and they can persuade other people who are in a state of agitation to calm down and manage a smile . If they believe in God and an afterlife , then the parts of life we are not responsible for are naturally rather a game . If they do n't believe , they find that generally it is more sensible to be amused than miserable . But what used to surprise me and make me a good deal less judging of people was to realize how vulnerable nearly all of them were , including these grown-up types . Unless he craves to straddle the world , there may he just a kernel of basic reassurance that each person needs . He needs some friends , some modest success in love or love life , a reasonable sense of accomplishment in the work that he does , and a home . Yet these benefits , in competition , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple , the psyches with which and the circumstances from which we must win satisfaction are not , and we live a long while , besides , seldom able to rest on our laurels . So one discovers that everybody 's equilibrium is surprisingly shaky , that you ca n't with impunity criticize someone , and that if you do criticize him you may rattle him more than you had intended . More 20 to the point , though , I began to grasp that snap judgments are incomplete , unjust , that the complex of emotion arid difficulty in which another man lives can not be quickly ascertained . Of course the glory and luck of it is that running counter to all that shakiness is a resilience : you ca n't shake up the fellow for long . Most of us have a way of riding out assaults or disappointments of even the toughest variety , an animal salubrity that takes over somehow and that we trust in , that makes us begin to grin a little again after a night 's sleep , a long walk in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leveler nowadays is divorce ; almost everybody thinks of it , whether because we expect to be happy all the time daily , weekly ? or because we want the smell of brimstone in lives made too affluent and easy . Maybe some of us will end up back with the same wives and husbands again at the end of our lives ( we sometimes hope so ) , but in the meantime it 's as if marriage had become some chancy , grim , modern experiment instead of an ancient institution . We have other lives to lead , we say to ourselves , casting about for more freedom or erotic sizzle , more simplicity , leisure , " integrity " at work , or money , or Edward Hoagland is the author of two collections of essays ? The Courage of TuriTeA and the recently published Walking the Dead Diamond River . whatever . Physiologically men reach their sexual peak at nineteen , an appropriate age for their original life-span of thirty years , but now they have forty more years to go , and the expectation is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every respect . To be original is to be lonely , we 've always been told , and for that reason , too , we may feel the need to have some form of hazard enter our lives , especially if it was not in our diet when we were young . Many divorces are not really the result of irreparable injury but involve instead a desire on the part of the man or woman to shatter the setup , start out from scratch alone , and make life work for them all over again . They want the risk of disaster , want to touch bottom , see where bottom is , and , coming up , to breathe the air again with relief and relish . It 's not easy . The public effort to look harmonious may help hold them together . After sitting in silence going to a party , they will hold hands in the taxi when they come home ; they make love rarely , but do so with pleasure if they have company staying over . Some of their differences are disconcertingly homely ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wants to keep it , and they disagree about the children 's school . He resents the fact that she got herself pregnant " accidentally " for each of the children , but she is sick and tired of hauling his timidity , which , among other things , would have meant that he 'd never have had any children in the first place if she had n't taken matters in hand . He resents almost as a betrayal her quick abandonment of most of the sex games ( what she calls " Krafft-Ebing " now ) that so pleased him during their courtship and drew him on , but she is tired of holding him to a maturity that should befit the head of a household ; it does n't seem to come naturally to him . Bachelors fail into two types , she thinks ? the " glassies , " who reflect back what they encounter , and the thickset , blocked sad fellows , to whom passivity is painful ? and he probably would have been one of the latter if she had n't turned up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , putting on shoes instead of her rakish black boots . She wants to go to Europe this summer , however , whereas he wants to bask at the beach . She thinks he treats his mother and father badly and that his behavior in their own fights is a continuation of hangups he has with them , but he makes no bones at all about his contention that her affection for her parents is livelier than what she feels for him , that even her preoccupation with motherhood is partly an attempt to give the world her mother all over again . They 're at swords ' points ; grotesqueries in each come to the fore . He carries a portable radio everywhere , to the dinner table , to the bathroom , and she constantly plays with the dog . In bed , when they argue late into the night or lie rigid , unable to speak , she crosses her arms on her chest and he holds his genitals as if to keep them intact for life later on . Apprehension , exhaustion make them postpone separating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prominent spots about the house , " bulletins , " to be read in silence and answered once a day , which cuts down the talk as well as the angst . Neither really wants disaster ; their nerves 11 and their stomachs beg them to have a care . 11 FOR A POOR BOY , just earning a lot of money used to he plenty . Now moneymaking is seldom sufficient ? we have other lives to lead . On the contrary , the higher the wages , the more wildcat strikes there area malaise afflicts the assembly lines . It 's the time off that people are concerned with . Hitchhiking has had a new vogue for its dramatization of rootlessness , and a good many young men and women brought up comfortably in the suburbs have plunged into bucolic living , the men immediately confronting the extraordinary question of whether or not they could build a house for themselves . To do so seemed essential to them , and a surprising proportion did manage somehow . As one visits among the communes , one finds the woods full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alpine chalets , airy , belvedered , summery bowers ? that often are empty . The fellow , hastily beginning the job , worrying about that formidable scatter of sawmill lumber ? the footing and sills and studs and siding ? forgot to think about locating water ( or built uphill from his spring ) . Maybe the site is so woodsy-lovely that his girlfriend finds it frightening at night ; they 're sleeping instead in a Volkswagen van parked next to the central farmhouse . Isolated shacks dispersed about may have come to seem in conflict with the overall experiment in living ; or perhaps the builders merely moved on , leaving these homes like dated bomb shelters . Because it 's a bad time for ideology , the communes are fading in favor of families who live private lives on a separate but friendly basis . The problem remains that a place where land is cheap enough for the simple life is also a depressed area where even the natives do n't find much work , and so the women tend to do rather better than the men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come up with the mortgage money , the women set about doing what they might do anywhere ? taking care of the kids , being ameliorative , homemaking . Particularly if they are the earth-mother sort to begin with , they thrive , while the men are dishwashers during the tourist season or carpenters or mechanics , or set up a bakery , do leather-work , carve salad bowls , drive a truck , until the limitations to earning a living in such a parched economy come to seem not worth a candle . I do n't believe this rural activity is only a footnote to the divisiveness of the Vietnam war . People are going to keep choosing a manner of living to suit themselves , and there OTHER LIVES are going to be different ways ; we forget what miracles we arc . On summer holidays some of the long-haired couples and communes in my town in Vermont get together for a big softball game , everybody contributing food for the meal that follows . The lush grass is high except where they 've knocked it down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leant tries to run up the score . Watching the playing , the smiles people wear as they swing , 1 think it must be as gleeful a time as any , these late-twenties that most of them are in . Sometimes I feel as though I 'm looking at snapshots taken today of one or another person , young , happy , at a kind of peak , on the best afternoon of the summer of their twenty-eighth year . It 's so American a scene that nearly everyone must be represented here , the lank hair only a disguise , I think , wondering where they will be , what will have happened to them , what changes their faces will show in twenty-eight more . Smiling in the sun , a girl takes a strong swing , and 1 feel perhaps some of the same painful tenderness she herself would feel years from now , holding pictures from today in her hands , pictures such as old men or women will show you to indicate that they too were graceful once and had happy times . Afterward , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ball-field calls in his herd of goats for milking ? " Goatee ! Goatee ! Goatee ! " The goats with their bland farmer faces run in a bevy of white bobbing heads , mild-looking . The new unfinished barn is a competent crosshatch of joists and roof beams , taller than it will seem when it is completed . We are friends because recently we walked forty-five miles together , cooking over wispy fires , eating from the same put , hunching under a canvas fly in the rain . He is so well settled here after eight years that it took me almost the whole forty-five miles to see him in that other guise that I always look for ? what he would have been like if he had n't left New York City . Finally , in the rain when he was tired , I recognized the New York face he would have worn , and it was darkly confused and sad . Often behind the communard 's veil of hair one sees a man who is just marking time , sliding past forks in the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with his fields and his garden and goats , in the midst of life . NEW YORK IF I GO OUT my door 1 and turn left I 'm at the federal holding penitentiary almost Mimediately . Loudspeakers , guards with carbines , and uteri in fetters taking a last look at the street before being led inside . There are attorneys , and the rigmarole of bread deliveries , and visiting wives , mothers , and babies ? " ten years ! " in the snatches of conversation . It 's said not to be a harsh place and probably would not have the facilities to handle a great deal of trouble , in any case . The guards who do look like ugly customers are the out-of-staters from prisons like Lewisburg who have driven in vans to transport the sentenced prisoners for a longer stay . They play with their chains as they wait ? long waist and leg chains . Turning right on the street , I 'm soon at a drug peddlers ' location , a slithy spot at midnight , where two dozen trucks are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moonlight is blocked off by railroad tracks running above . Over by a single bulb at the far corner a mechanic , as a cover , is leaning into an engine , making some repairs , while the sellers , several of them , pace in and out between the tight trucks , quickly disappearing in the darkness to reappear at another spot . A series of Dickensian starvelings scatter up , each one palavering furtively and moving off , while other addicts wait their turn in the gloomy doorways down the block . They are generally so thin that they remind me of the poverty of another continent , casting desolate-looking faces backward as they come and go , to see whether anybody is following them . But some drive up and park , and a courier service is operated for wholesale deals , because every few minutes an off-duty taxi swings slowly past and makes a pickup ? if the cabbie is scared he keeps going around the block until one of the peddlers whistles at him . It 's a perfect maze , and if all the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fill the federal detention headquarters . Some will find themselves there rapidly enough anyway . For them it is only a step from being free to being nabbed . They 've already largely been nabbed . The foghorns of the waterfront , carried through the window , cause a slippage of resolve in me , just as they must work to demoralize the prisoners and peddlers and addicts nearby we have other lives to lead . I 'm not so sure I know what is permanent anymore , although as recently as a year or two ago I thought I did . The stars , the flowers , and so on ? genes , mountains , and even the sore points of love . Picking at the heaps of raspberries growing up from the ruins of an old barn ? sweet from the manuring of twenty years I 'd find a quietude in that . Our choreography , too , outlives us . A porcupine pushes its head around the corner of the house and , with weak bulging eyes , cautiously sits up on its hindquarters before venturing onto the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slide inside for my gun . When my dog sees me loading he thinks his time may have come . He knows there is no escape , if so , having seen other men shoot other dogs , and cringes as our eyes meet . The porcupine , which had retreated alongside the house , heads for the woods when I reappear , its waddle transformed into a flight for life . It 's a primitive animal that , when wounded , still only waddles , can not limp , but die it does , sighing as a person would . And yet during this sad episode I 've felt larger , quicker , hardly nireff , augmented as though by the fact that each of us has moved along tracks older than our own time and place . Most people enjoy some sense of permanence , even rather approving of the circumstance that old people die eventually ( part of the permanence ) , until they themselves grow old . Much of my own feeling of permanence has been grounded in the wildness of the natural world . Wildness is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of particulars that are changing only very slowly without special reference to man . That the sun shines just as brightly on somebody who is dying of thirst is our good luck , because if he could turn out the sun for himself it would go out for us . Now " wildness , " instead of being infinity and superabundance , has a different reference , however , often simply the sniper gone haywire up in the bell tower . Although there should be other reasons besides what we call natureto believe in the permanence of the world , if nature in health and wealth and variety is to be permitted to exist only for its recreational value to man , then we must base our convictions about the world 's permanence , in the meanwhile , on the permanence of him . That would n't be so hard to do , when one considers people to be more good than bad , except for the exceptional power at hand nowadays in those brutal moments , even just to the local vandal . Ten years of good intentions ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dangerously balanced duality . Where the Indians were spellbound by the succession of thunderheads in their sky ? which was so much bigger than ours ? we eye ourselves ; or , when we do turn our attention away from our own psyches , we watch our leaders , who have become bigger than the sky . TE HAVE OUR FREEDOM and mi- l/ raculous variance , and lately I 've tried to discover which is the wildest mountain left in Vermont , from scouting as well as map-reading and talking to people . I think that I have . A Jeep could bump to within a mile or two of the east or west base , but nobody happens to climb it . The mountains round about are encountered first , and it 's an intricate , broad-topped , low little mountain , a confusion of starfish ridges and high swamps thick with windfalls . Nothing spectacular , no cliffs , waterfalls , or fifty-mile views , just lots of forest . Its distinction is only its wildness , and moose , bear , lynx , and coyotes make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequently wind toward it in walks , tasting the creeks that run off its sides , getting to know the valleys below , spending the night on mountains nearby so as to look at its contours at dusk and at dawn . Old log-skidding trails go halfway up , and I soft-foot up some of these , watching for animal prints , but though it seems like a low little mountain , hiding its higher complexities , eventually I turn back , postponing climbing clear to the top . Such an important event should not be rushed . If this indeed is the most remote mountain in Vermont , I hope to explore it gradually for many summers and never really climb it . Wildness is indifference , wildness exists without any knowledge of whether or not it will be destroyed . Its survival on this last mountain matters not to the mountain , not to the attributes that define wildness , but only to me . Half the battle is knowing what matters , and if we are prepared to make up our minds , an almost unlimited number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowded than it used to be . Alongside the closeness and safeness and sameness of modern living is a frightening roominess. ? cheap instant travel , swift risk and misery , wars marbled with primeval terror , old-fashioned loneliness and poverty , yet scholarship leading straight toward the roots of life , and so many experiments in pleasure in progress that it takes only a minimal gift for adventure for somebody to live several lives in the space of one . What is scandalous or impermissible now ? Kicking a child in the street ; maybe a few other odd taboos . So , what is happening is that we come to face the decision : do we want to explore ourselves in several marriages or in only one ? Do we want one life to lead , or more ? And how much does our own ambivalence really interest us ? are we ourselves , in self-concern , the best focus in life ? No doubt there are n't single answers ; nor 11 ill our private answers necessarily have much to do with how we behave . Instead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistake we will land on our feet . What we know , as social sea changes come roaring at us , is that human beings are extraordinarily adaptive . I stand on a pier near my house , looking at the river and south toward the larger harbor . If I were feeling glum it might seem an escape route , but I 'm simply watching the sunlight jiggle on the wide currents refres h-ingly wider than the yardsticks of distance that one is used to in the city . The water 's jiggling establishes a parallel lightness in me , and though the weather happens to he cold , the sunlight brings out from within me , besides my good . spirits , the lizards , snakes , turtles that / originally was ? all the creatures that merged to make me , and that loved the sunlight , depending upon it so much that even if I no longer need it myself as imperatively , I ca n't feel it on my skin without slowing my thoughts and my feet , stopping and closing my eves for a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunshine that I turn my throat to slowly , and the water hopping and sparkling , and many moiling dogs . Fortunately for my own safely , however , I 'm neither dog nor lizard , because this is the center of the city and two or three hundred other people besides me are taking their ease on the pier . An inventory of what they look like could wind up as the history of the world , which , needless to say , I 'm not up to on this fine afternoon ; but I 'm at home with them Without sparing much attention from the boats and the children , the lovers and girls and old people whose stories I 'd like to hear , I can pretty well spot people in trouble and those who spell trouble and get a handle on anybody who ambles near . Schizophrenia , diabetic collapse , belt-between-the-teeth for epilepsy ? subway things . There are encroachers and trapped people , and people here before they go home to dress for a party ; one can place them in their apartments and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a freighter steaming grandly by , and harges , tugboats , police boats , sightseers ' launches . The West Side Highway provides constant engine static ; and two private planes are crossing overhead , and now a 707 on a descent pattern , sweeping around toward LaGuardia . A helicopter is sliding downtown , very low above us , with another angling in stiffly from New Jersey . From every direction aircraft arc converging , it seems ? a third helicopter , I suddenly notice ? and the trucks on West Street , and the roar of the cars on the highway over them , and these crowds of wrought-up people here to relax for an hour . Lizard though I am , dog that I am , I am able to absorb it all . Whirlybirds , arrested-looking in the air , furrow through the other layers of sound ? and big flat airliners , as gray as the newest invented metal and large-looking as skyscrapers as they turn ? and some stunting guy in a powerboat making waves down where we are . Yet somehow the more the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the ocean and suddenly Lake Superior is dumped in , then the Danube and Nile , then the Caspian Sea . But one bobs above them . Whether one will always bob above them is a question . But , grinning , one finds that somehow each increment is adjusted for ; one rides above it ; it can all be absorbed .
