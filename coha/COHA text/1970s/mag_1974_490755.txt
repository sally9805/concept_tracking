THE SPORTING SCENE EAST SEPTEMBER , WEST OCTOBER . THE stammer 's immense business is at last shut down , the Oakland A 's stand bernedalled as the three-time champions of the world and first-time champions of California , and the sound of baseball silence is upon the land . The excellent World Series , in which the familiar green-and-yellow team  --  Sal and Reggie and Joe , Rollie and Ken and Campy and Cat , and all the other dashing Octoherm  --  nknocked off the young Dodgers in five games , and the preceding league plat - offs , which both concluded in four , were mercifully brisk and decisive . They constituted the only visible signs of economy in a season of excess , which must now he sorted out somehow . 0 for a Muse of fire ! Or , rather , 0 for a competent certified public accountant , who at least might begin to bring order out of the untidy profligacy of baseball news and records and races , baseball achievement and failure and unlikelihood , that made the late summer and early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for us all . On the chance of such help , we can at least pick out a few preliminary clips and jottings from this year 's crowded files . No FES FOR A STONECUTTER : Flank Aaron , who started off briskly with those two April home runs that took him past Babe Ruth 's ancient roadmark of seven hundred and fourteen , eoneluded his labors for the year with twenty homers , or seven hundred and thirty-three lifetime . This year , he also took over first place on the all-time roster for games played ( 3,0761 and times at hat ( 11,628 ) , and added to his first-place figures for lifetime total bases ( 6,591-1 and extra-base hits ( 1,429 ) . Aaron is retiring from the Atlanta Braves , but if he succeeds with his reported plan to sign on with the Milwaukee Brewers as a designated hitter ( and , it is said , future general manager ) , he will have a clear shot next year at Ruth 's first-place standard of 2,217 runs hatted in . Aaron has now passed Ty Cobh as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in baseball history . LEus : Lou Brock , of the Cardinals , stole one hundred and eighteen bases this summer , thus wiping out the old one-season mark of one hundred and four thefts held by Maury Wills . ( Brock was caught stealing thirty-three times . ) Brock , who is thirty-five , estimates that he is two or three feet slower between bases than he was at his youthful peak , which suggests that the real contest on the base paths is mostly cerebral and strategic  --  the base runner 's experience versus the pitcher 's nerves . The other essential ingredients for the remarkable new record were Brock 's batting average of .306 for the year ( he had to get on some base in order to set about stealing the next ( me ) and the batting judgment and protection provided by the next man in the Cardinal lineup , Ted Si7emnre . Watching Lou Brock taking a lead off first base is the best fun in baseball . ARMS : Mike Marshall , the muscular , muttonchopped relief man for the Los Angeles Dodgers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thus wiping out his own previous one-season mark of ninety-two , which he set last year with the Expos . To judge by his effectiveness ( fifteen wins , twenty-one saves , an earned-run average of 2.42 ) , his combativeness , and his habit of pitching batting practice for the Dodgers after even one clay of idleness , he is perfectly capable of raising this mark by twenty or thirty games , if Walter Alston and the Dodger starters should so require . Nolan Ryan , the California Angels ' firehaller , pitched his third no-hit game in two y cars , attaining a lifetime level reached by only five other pitchers . ( Sandy Koufax notched four . ) Ryan also struck out nineteen hatters in a single game , to tic a record previously held by Steve Carlton and Tom Seaver . Ryan , however , did this three ' times this year . He struck out more than three hundred hitters ( three hundred and sixty-seven ) in a single season for the third time . One of his deliveries was timed by an electronic device @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's old speed mark ( recorded on a different machine ) of 98.6 m.p.h . Another Ryan pitch struck Red Sox second baseman Doug Griffin above the ear , retiring Idm from competition for two months ; the next game in which Griffin faced Ryan , hr hit two singles . l No award or trophy for courage was offered to either man . ) Ryan throws super-smoke , but when baseball people get together for a few drinks , the fastball pitcher they always talk about is Steve Dalkowski , an Oriole farmhand of the late fifties and early sixties , who set records for strikeouts and jumpy batters wherever he played . in one typical stet with e Class D club , 11 ( ? threw one hundred and twenty-dne strikeouts and gave up one hundred and twenty-nine walks and thirty-nine wild pitches , all in the span of sixty-two innings . Dallo twski never made it to the iltijorS , but , being a legend , he is secure for the ages . " Once I saw him work a game in the Appalachian League. , " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and nothing was hit forward for seven innings  --  not even a feud ball . " ( An attempt was also made to clock Dalkowski on a recording device , sit his eventual mark of 93.5 m.p.h. was discounted , since he threw for forty minutes before steering a pitch into the machine 's recording gone , ) Ryan was one of nine American League pitchers to achieve twenty wins this year  --  a new record mostly attributable to the designated-hitter artifice , which allows starting pitchers to st:n in a game until their ears are knocked off . In the American League , the traditional level of pitching effectiveness probably should now he raised From twenty to twenty-five games  --  a more exclusive neighborhood , inhabited this summer only bi Ferguson Jenkins and Catfish Hunter . ARRIVAL : The day after the regular season ended , Frank Robinson was named manager of the Cleveland Indians . He is the First black manager in the majoi-s , and the belated , much publiciz  --  d appointment confirms the in-fl exihiliti and down-home cronyism that still pervade most of the business side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women executives are equally invisible . Commissioner Bowie Kuhn and the two league presidents had pressured the clubs to make such an appointment , and alter it happened Kuhn said , " I dii n't think that baseball should be exceptionally proud of this day . It 's been long overdue . " Robinson , who will take over a feeble and . to judge by its play in late September ) demoralized club , will have his work cut out for him , but he is qualified foi the job . He was a true team leader during his six years with the Orioles , where his manager was Earl Weaver , one of the best and most accessible baseball thinkers of our time . Robinson has also managed the Santurce Crab-hers in Puerto Rico for five winter seasons , and an observer of his performance there has told me that he was unexcitable , tough , and effective , not hesitating on occasion to take down such superstars as Reggie Jackson ( who is black ) and such prima donnas as Dave Kingman ( who is white ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hack manager in the majors to be fired . DEPARTURES Dick Allen , the highest-paid player in the game , at two hundred and twenty-five thousand tic &; lars per year , announced his retirement from the White Sox at the age of thirty-two . He was an odd and enigmatic eminence  --  a great hitter and sii ? perior fielder who disdained or ignored every aspect of baseball except occasionally the actual playing of it , the game on the field . He could scarcely hear to give his attention to spring training , to the press , to bus and plane schedules , or , in the end , even to batting p raC tied . Unsurprisingly , he exhausted the patience of several managers and owners , but when at last he was traded to Chicago , in 1972 , his new manager , Chuck Tanner , announced that ant private drumbeat heard by Dick Allen was perfectly acceptable to him , since Allen was obviously the best player an ) - where . Allen responded with one splendid season  --  a .308 average , thins - seven homers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only Most Valuable Planer a ward . The next year , he broke a leg , and since then his other preoccupations - late hours , breeding race horses , silence , indifference have kept him from the almost limitless baseball heights that could have been his . It is a strange , sad business . Although he quit the sport with two weeks remaining in the season , his thirty-two home runs were tops in his league this year . Al Kaline retired , after tweno - two memorable years with the Tigers . Here there should he no gloom . On September 24th , Kaline rapped out a single and a double against the Orioles and thus surpassed his announced final goal in baseball  --  three thousand lifetime hits . He finished up with thret thousand and seven , which places din eleventh on the all-time list of hitters ? -a most distinguished gentlemen 's club . In temperament and talent , he was almost exactly the opposite of Dick Allen . Never a superstar or a true slugger ( his lifetime batting average is a shade under .30(I) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very close to the peak of his ability , and the fealty he aroused was almost religious in its ardor . The week after the season ended , I received a four-page letter about him from one of his lifelong fans , a professor at the University of Michigan , who said , among other things , " He did everything perfectly  --  fielding , throwing , running , judgment , hunting , advancing runners , hitting the ball .... I am sorry to see him go , because he may be the last of the complete ballplayers . " I heard almost the same words from Eddie Kaska , the former Boston manager and now a super-scout for the Red Sox , who added , " I even liked watching him take outfield practice . He did the whole thing , every part of the game , the way it should be done . If he was throwing to third , say , he would line up his body , take the ball just right , and get off the throw like a picture . You enjoyed it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did I suddenly become aware of the marvel of Al Kaline 's name . Somewhere in the world , I wonder  --  perhaps in Spain  --  could there be an outfielder named A. Cid ? ) DiscoRD : It was a famous year for fights commotions in the stands , em-hroilments on the field , scuffles in clubhouses , ructions on the road . Early in the summer , some fans celebrated Beer Night at the Cleveland ballpark with such energy that it cost the Indians a forfeited game ; on the last night of the season , Pittsburgh fans celebrated a pennant by showering visiting Cub outfielders with obscenities and empty bottles . The contumelious world-champion A 's staged a main-event clubhouse one-rounder between outfielders Reggie Jackson and Bill North , which sidelined catcher ( and would-be peacemaker ) Ray Fosse for half the season . The Yankees may have lost their chance at a pennant when an alcoholic battle between two second-line players in the lobby of the Pfister Hotel , in - Milwaukee , resulted in an injury to Bobby Murcer ( also a noncombatant ) which kept him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win . Most baseball scuffles , of course , are purely entertaining . On September 22nd , in Busch Stadium , the visiting Cubs were batting in the ninth against the Cardinals in a critical game , then tied at 5-5 . The Cardinals ' pitcher was their ace reliever , Al Hrahosky , who has the habit of withdrawing from the mound between deliveries and walking halfway to second base , where he holds s visible converse with himself until he attains a point of confidence and batter-hatred that will allow him to return and offer up the next pitch . On this edgy occasion , the Cub batter , Bill Madlock , waited until lirabosky had completed his psychic countdown , and then reversed the process , walking halfway to his dugout and turning his back on the field while he tapped dirt from his shoes and muttered mutters . Plate umpire Shag Crawford observed this parody and then briskly ordered Madlock back to his place of business . Madlock protested , and so did the Cub manager , Jim Marshall . Crawford signalled to Hrabosky to proceed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strike  --  an automatic call , under the rules . Hrabosky , delighted , got the ball back and tired again , just as Madlock and the on-deck Cub hitter , Jose Cardenal , both leaped into the hatter 's box . Crawford signalled " No pitch " and turned to adjudicate matters , at which point the Cardinal catcher , Ted Simmons , punched Madlock in the face . Chaos . In time , the field was cleared of panting partisans and bystanders , Manager Marshall was excused for the afternoon , and play resumed ; the Cardinals won the game in the bottom of the inning , on a single by Simmons . Asked later what Madlock had said that had proved insupportable to him , Simmons replied , " He did n't say anything . I did n't like the way he was looking at me ! ' LONGIEs : On September 11th , the Mets and the Cardinals played a **25;4788;TOOLONG game at Shea Stadium , which the Cardinals won , 4-3 , at 3:12 A.M. , in twenty-five innings . ( The home-plate imp was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a twenty-three-inning Mets game in 1964 and a twenty-four-inning Men game in 1968 . There is no time and a half , by the way , for umpires . ) On September 21st , the Red Sox defeated the Orioles , 6-5 , in ten innings , in a game that consumed six hours and twenty-seven minutes because of rain delays . The winning pitcher , Bill Lee , went the full distance . The loss dropped the Orioles out of first place . On September 25th , the Cardinals beat the Pirates , 13-12 , in eleven innings . The Pirates scored three runs in the top of the eleventh ; the Cardinals scored four runs in the bottom half . The victor moved the Cardinals into first place and dropped the Pirates to second . On September 27th , the Orioles defeated the Brewers , 1-0 , in seventeen innings , in a game that lasted four hours and twenty-eight minutes . Tin winning run scored on a bunt . The victory moved the Orioles into a One-game lead in their division . As it happened , all these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grudging , hitter competition in the pennant races that were fought down through the final wei:ks and days and hours of the season in the two Eastern divisions . ThC Cardinal victory in that enfilade of zeros at Shea brought them hack from a three-and-a-half-game deficit and began a reversal that returned them to first place within four days . During the final month , the Cards and the Pirates exchanged the lead in the National League East four times and tied at the top four times ; the Pirates ' final one-anti-a-half-gamy margin was achieved by means of four wins over the Cardinals out of six harshly contested head-to-head September games --  that , plus a passionate kiss of fortune bestowed on them in the last of the ninth inning of their very last game of thc season : with two out and the Cubs leading by 4-3 , Pirate pinch-hit-ter Bob Robertson struck out , swinging , but Cub catcher Steve Swisher Failed to hold the ball . He then hit Robertson on the back with his peg toward first , allowing the thing run to score from third . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the A.L . East began with the Red Sox still in their sumMerhc niSt at the top of the division but already in the grip of a frightful batting catatonia that eventually resulted in an eight-game losing streak , ten defeats in twelve games ( including seven shutouts ) , and , on September 5th , the end of their lead . The startled inheritors of first place were the Yankees , who had been doing some streaking of their own  --  twelve wins out of fourteen games , including six in a row . A clear marvel , but not the only one , as it happened , for here came the Orioles , suddenly the winners of ten straight , including an astounding five successit shutouts , four of them thrown In the celebrated ancients of their pitching corps . Any appreciation of the Yankees must he clouded by our knowledge that their adventurous summer voyage fell just short of its goal The headshakings and forebodings of the nonbelievers and Yankee-haters proved to he correct  --  not quite enough pitching , not enough speed , not enough power ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the league in both home runs and stolen bases ) , not quite enough anything to win , even in an admittedly weak division . Yes , but who cared about any of that hack when it all seemed to be happening ? Was n't that the whole point , the real joy of it ? These Yankees were a cobbled-up team of retreads , trade bait , and disappointed , fading regulars . The new manager , Bill Virdon , was hired only when the original appointee , Dick Williams , became legally estopped from the job . The best old Yankees  --  Mel Stottlemyre , Bobby Murcer , Thurman Munson  --  were either sidelined or slumping . Some of the new ones  --  Elliott Maddox ( who had forced Bobby Murcer to move to right field , our of his old center-field slot ) , Lou Piniella , Jim Mason  --  could hit and nr field at times , but they displayed no semblance of the traditional Yankee muscle . Other arrivals first base-man Chris Chambliss from Cleveland , second baseman Sandy Alomar and pitcher Rudy May from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minors  --  were suspect simply because of their sudden availability and the Yankees ' utter need for help . But never mind ; it all came together somehow , The pitchers  --  Doe Medich , Pat Dobson , Gura ; Sparkv Lyle from the bullpen -- began to function together , suddenly resembling a modest engine rather than a collection of parts ; in September Chambliss began to hit at last , and so did Munson , and Roy White was forever getting on base , and Bobby Murcer finally hit a home run at Shea Stadium . The crowds and the screaming and the banners ( " VES , W E LAN ! " ) burst forth there once again , this time for the new tenants , and some optimist discovered that the club did lead the league in at least one category  --  sacrifice flies . In the second week of September , the team took to the road and won successive series in Boston , Baltimore , and Detroit . In the eleventh inning of the second game in Boston , Sandy Alomar saved everything with an astounding dive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thwarted the winning Red Sox run ; Alex Johnson , a brand-new Yankee , then won the game with a homer in the twelfth . In Baltimore , Mike Wallace made his first American League start and shut out the Orioles and Jim Palmer , 3-0 . In Detroit , the Yankees wrapped up the trip by scoring ten runs against the Tigeis in each of the last two games , and came home two and a half games in front of the pack . Yes , it seemed , they could ! No , they could n't . The home stand opened against the Orioles , and the trio of veteran Baltimore pitchers , perfectly accustomed to taking difficult matters in hand in late stormier , now utterly suppressed the arrivistes with three beautifully pitched complete-game victories-4-0 for Palmer , 10-4 for Mike Cuellar , 7-0 for Dave McNally  --  and Baltimore took over the lead by a half game . The visitors offered instructive lessons in power , in defense ( notably some wizard catches in center by Paul Blair , of the kind he has been making for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baseball itself . In the second game , Bobby Grich led off the fourth inning with a walk and then was sent along to third on a hit-and-run single by designated hitter Tomtit ) Davis , who stroked the hall precisely behind Sandy Alomar as the second baseman dashed over to cover second ; Grich scored a moment later . In the sixth , Grich again led off with a walk , and this time Davis improved on his prior masterpiece , rapping the hit-and-run , two-and-two pitch a hare yard behind Alomar 's heels , as Sandy once again jammed on the brakes and attempted a backward dive at the ball . Nothing in baseball is prettier than this , and no one does it better than Davis . Seven runs now swiftly ensued  --  and so did my absolute conviction that the Orioles could win this pennant . The Orioles ' clubhouse was a merry place on these evenings , for the team had revived its Kangaroo Court  --  a traditional buffoonery staged after each Baltimore victory . The judgeship this year went to catcher Elrod Hendricks ( Frank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who presided with perfect unfairness and the assistance of a sawed-off , magenta-colored hat stub . " Cases " were loudly brought against various players  --  Mark Belanger for being overambitious on the base paths , Brooks Robinson for an error , Coach Billy Hunter for some invented malfeasance  --  and suitable booby prizes ( an ancient , silver-painted spike shoe , a broken-down glove ) were awarded and one-dollar fines assessed . " Vote ! " the entire team would shout . " Vote ! Vote ! " And Hendricks , brandishing his hat , would roar out the guilty verdict : " One ! Two ! Three ! WHOP ! " The Orioles were loose . The Yanks were not yet done . They swept a four-game home series from the Indians and were back in first by a single game when the Red Sox came to Shea on September 24th and won both games of a wintry twi-night doubleheader . That was the stunner . Luis Tiant , the venerable Cuban master , threw a six-hit , 4-0 shutout in the opener , thereby achieving his twenty-first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month earlier , he had been the first pitcher in the majors to win his twentieth game of the season , and the Sox had been comfortably ahead . " In baseball , " he said now , puffing a post-game cigar as he soaked his arm in ice water , " you do n't know nothin ' . " ) The Bosox won the nightcap by 4 -- 2 as the Yankees and their fans both began to come apart a little . Bobby Murcer fell on the base paths and was tagged out , and there were two errors by the Yankee infield and an unearned Boston run , On the scoreboard , the Orioles , playing at home , trailed for a time , but then they came hack and heat the Tigers and took over first again ( for good , this tine , it turned out ) , and the shivering , unsatisfied 46,4-48-man crowd at Shea fell into disputation and anger , showering the field with firecrackers and ? Id tennis halls . In the seventh , the game was stopped for several minutes while squads of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and prolonged fistfights and pulled them , writhing , from the stands . This was September baseball  --  or a part of it , at least . There was something cold and miserable about it , beyond the pain and disappointment of watching a whole , long summer 's work going for nothing . Winter was coming . Both clubhouses were quiet that night . Manager Virdon drank long swigs from a container of milk and murmured , " Our morale is all right , " and stared at the Yankee schedule affixed to the wall of his office , on which he had pencilled in the starting pitchers and results of ever ' , game . He was down to the last line . None of the reporters could think of anything useful to say to him . Bobby Murcer , asked about the violent fans , said , " I do n't blame ' em . Tonight , I wanted to get up there and whale with them . " MHE next Saturday  --  a cool , driz-zlyafternoon  --  I began a vigil in front of my television set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a week of baseball remained . The Cardinals and the Cubs were scheduled for Chan-nel 4 on the NBC Game of the Week , the Yankees were away for a double-header in Cleveland on Channel 11 , and the Mets were entertaining the Pirates at Shea on Channel 9 , so most of the contenders were available to me . The Yanks sprang away to a quick 2-0 lead over Gaylord Perry , on a homer by Ron Blomberg , and out in Chicago , on a gloomy day , the Cub and Cardinal pitchers worked two quick , scoreless innings . Switching channels , I became aware of distractions , On Channel 7 , Texas Tech was leading Texas in football  --  a possible upset there  --  and on Channel 5 W. C. Fields was sudden ) visible at work in a grocery store . Could it be It was : Channel 5 was running a super Fields movie , " It 's a Gift . " On Channel 4 , Cub pitcher Rick Reuschel knocked down Ken Reitz with a pitch , then fanned him . On 1.1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most ) sliders . On Channel 5 , Fields wrapped up a five-cent order of chewing gum with paper and string while a customer shouted ' Where are my kumquats ? " On Channel 4 , Rcuschel walked Ted Simmons . It was beginning to rain out there in Chicago . On Channel 9 , they were taking off the tarpaulin at Shea  --  a delayed start . On Channel 7 , Texas Tech had gone up by 26-3 . Back on Channel 5 , W. C. Fields called out to a blind man , " Sit , still , Mr. Muckle , honey ! , " but Mr , Muckle blundered into an enormous display rack of light bulbs , I could not tarry . Back to Channel 11 , where Elliott Maddox ripped a double down the left-field line . The ? Indians held it mound conference and decided to pitch to Ron Blomberg ( " Which I like to see , " Phil Rizzuto announced ) , and Blomberg hit his second home run into the right-field upper deck , for a 5-0 Yankee lead . On Channel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a can of clams . On Channel 9 , the Pirates were leading , I-0 . On Channel 4 , NBC had given up on the delayed Game of the Week and was offering a costume drama in its place : Tyrone Power , wearing tights , was in prison . Someone was asking him to sign a confession of heresy ; Power smiled enigmatically . On Channel 9 , Pittsburgh manager Danny Murtaugh yelled at an umpire . On Channel 5 , IV . C. Fields groaned as he attempted to go back to sleep on a porch swing up on a third-floor balcony ; a man on the ground was calling up to him , asking for someone named Carl LaFong . " Carl La -- Fong ! " he shouted . " Large ' C , ' small a , ' small r , ' small 1 , ' large L , ' small a , ' large ' F , ' small ' o ' ... " On Channel 7 , Texas Tech kicked off to Texas , and the ball went right out of the end zone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had cleared up a little , and took my son out to the park for a quick snootful of air . When we got hack , Richie Zisk was in the act of hitting a homer for the Pirates off Tug McGraw on Channel 9 , and the Pirates were leading the Mets by 6-1 . The scoreboard at Shea showed that the Yankees had won their first game against the Indians , 9-3 . The game in Chicago had resumed , with the Cubs ahead by 4-3 in the seventh ; NBC had blown it . W. C. Fields had vanished from Channel 5 . Apparently , Channel 11 was not going to telecast the second Yankee game ; an Abbott and Costello program was on instead . The Orioles would not play until evening ... . Three nights later , again via TV , I saw the Yankees lose to the Brewers , 3-2 , in Milwaukee . There were no interruptions this time , no escape . The Yankees led for a while . It was terrifically cold in Milwaukee , and the stands there were almost deserted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon , and the Yanks trailed in the standings by a game and a half ; a loss here would do them in . ( The Red Sox were finished . ) In the eighth , a long drive to right field was misplayed by Maddox and Piniella , and the Brewers tied the game at 2-2 . The ball could have been caught by Bobby Murcer , the regular right fielder , but he was absent because of the injury he had suffered in that hotel-lobby scrap . ( None of the Yankee telecasters explained this ; baseball announcers work for the club and are not encouraged to give out had news. ) in the bottom of the tenth , Milwaukee shortstop Jack Lind doubled to right . He was sacrificed to third by John Vukovich . There was an intentional walk to Don Money , and then another walk , to Sixth Lezcano , loaded the bases . The Yankee broadcasters spoke in whispers . I had never /ward of Lind , Vukovich , or Lezcano . George Scott came up and hit the first pitch into center field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playoffs were swift , tasty , light  --  a confection of baseball pleasures . I went first to Pittsburgh , and repeated a favorite autumn stroll of mine  --  over the Fort Duquesne Bridge to Three Rivers Stadium , with the water taxis churning up the sparkling Allegheny below , the sound of a band playing somewhere , the eager early arrivals filing along quietly together , and our expectation almost visible in the soft sunshine . Most of all , I looked forward to watching the Dodgers , a young and wonderfully talented club that had led its division all year and had fought off a scary challenge by the Cincinnati Reds that was a good deal too reminiscent of the late charge to which Los Angeles succumbed the summer before . This year , the Reds had closed to within a game and a half of the Dodgers on September 15th , but a grand-slam homer by Dodger outfielder Jimmy Wynn had beaten them that day , and , it turned out , had broken them for the year . The Dodgers had pitching and speed and power  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and absolute self-confidence . Actually , their first-line pitching had looked a trifle thin ever since a disabling injury to Tommy John , their best left-hander , but there was Mike Marshall  --  Marshall almost every day ? to take up the slack . The Dodger infielders had been known on occasion to terrify patrons in the box seats behind first base , but they also had the boyish ability to pull off the plainly impossible play . The Pirates ' record , by contrast , was built on plain hitting  --  by warm young bats like Richie Zisk and Al Oliver , and heavy hoppers like Willie Stargell and Richie Hebner . Their pitching , never much to admire , had been weakened by the loss of Dock Ellis . The Dodgers , however , had not won a game in Pittsburgh all year . All such speculation dwindled away and became perfectly useless in the course of the next couple of hours , as Dodger starter Don Sutton shut out the Pirates , 3-0 , with four bare singles . It was a sight to remember  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , strength , delicacy , and control , and so dominating the event that everything else that happened 011 the field became nearly superfluous . The Dodgers , for the record , scored once in the second , on a pair of singles and a pair of walks off Pirate starter Jerry Reuss , and twice in the ninth , on three hits and a stolen base . Sutton , a right-hander , was not overpowering ; he gave up one walk and struck out six . Above all , perhaps , he was intelligent , adjusting every pitch to the precise situation and batter at hand , controlling the corners , throwing patterns  --  up and in , out and away , curve and fastball and slider  --  and reaffirming the enormous imbalance between hurler and hitter that makes baseball look so difficult when pitching is at its prime . Afterward , Sutton admitted that no more than four of his deliveries had disappointed him . " I 'd like to write this game down in a textbook and use it for the rest of my Career , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total surprise to him , however , since it was his tenth victory in a row and his fourteenth in his last fifteen games , I had previously seen Sutton at Dodger Stadium in June , when he was suffering through a frustrating and depressing slump . Manager Walter Alston had left him alone , permitting him to work out his problem while he absorbed six consecutive losses . " It 's just some little mistake , " Alston told me at the dine . " Probably his body is not in exacdv the right position over-his leg when he delivers , It 's puzzling , but loo have uz ht. patient . Pitching is a subtle thing . " That textbook of Sotum 's , 011 ? could imagine , might hear the imprimatur of the Alston Press . A few more Dodgers got into the act the next afternoon , when a 5-2 win for the visitors put the unhappy home team into a very deep hole . ( Three losses in the Championship Series means elimination , of course , and so far in the series ' six-year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Andy Messersrnith , the Dodgers ' only twenty-game winner this year , continued the starvation of the Pirate sluggers , giving up nothing but singles . The golden Californians , meanwhile , got on the board in the first with a ringing hit by their excellent first baseman , Steve Garvey ( he hatted .312 this year , had two hundred hits , and drove in one hundred and eleven runs ) , and again in the fourth , on a home run by third baseman Ron Cry . The Pirates at last roused themselves in the seventh , tying the game on two pinch singles , a sacrifice , and a hit by Al Oliver that caromed off Cey 's glove . The deprived Pittsburgh rooters screeched hopefully at this little tippytoe rally , and then lapsed again into miserable silence when the Dodgers responded instanter with three runs in the top of the eighth . Cry started things off with ins second successive double ( he was four for five in the day , with nine total bases ) , and then shortstop Bill Russell laid down a perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manny Sangoillen threw hopelessly to third base . Then Crawford honked a little . handle-hit over the drawn-in infield , and Mota singled and Lopes singled , and Sanguillen added a wild pickoff throw  --  five successive hits and a little luck , too , hut the Pirates had clearly been cracked apart by the pressure of speed and eager , winning baseball . Cey 's outburst at the plate .11so looked lucky , until one noticed that he had driven in ninety-seven runs in the season  --  one more than Willie Stargell . I now bade farewell to the two N.L. squads , who were off to Chavez Ravine for the rest of their exercises . ( The Pirate bats , it will be recalled , came alive there for one afternoon , for a 7-0 Pittsburgh victory , in which Stargell and Hchner homered . The following day , the Dodgers took the pennant with a gruesome 12-1 laugher . ) My next engagement was the renewal of the A's-Orioles playoff rival-13 , in Baltimore  --  by now an autumn event nearly as heartwarming and as poorly attended as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back from the West tied at one game apiece ; the Orioles , finding Catfish Hunter uncharacteristically wild and high , had whacked him for three homers and a 6-3 victory , and had then been stopped cold by Ken Holtzman , 5-0 . The pitching rriatchup in Game No. 3 looked unfair  --  Jim Palmer , whose Championship Series record for the Orioles was four victories and no defeats , against Vida Blue , who had never won a playoff game or a World Series game , being 0-2 in each category . Everyone knew Vida . ' s pattern  --  blinding heat for a time , then a slight lapse in concentration , a few walks , a reduction of speed in favor of control , then a couple of telling base hits , and , all ton often , another game gone . Absolutely true , except that here in Baltimore it did n't happen . Instead , it was Vida non-stop ; Vida burning with concentration and impatience ; Vida overpowering everything and everyone , including himself ; Vida wall-to-wall . He threw one hundred and one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up two singles , struck out seven hatters , walked none , and came in with a 1-0 victory in less titan two hours . It was another nearly awesome performance , but one that bore almost no relation to Sutton 's game ; one felt that the two pitchers might have been engaged in different sports . For that matter , there was still a third splendid and courageous effort  --  Jim Palmer 's losing four-hitter . Palmer has been afflicted with an injury to the tdnar nerve in his pitching arm this ) car , and he now throws very few fasthalls . All the same , he went the distance , too , facing only two more batters than Blue did , and the game eventually turned on a brief personal duel between him and Sal Band() in the fourth , when Banda fouled off several pitches and then lined a home run into the left-field stands . " I should have walked him , " Palmer murmured afterward . Manager Weaver , summing up Blue 's great game , said , " Our best shot against him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . " Pitching is very nearly the whole story in the playoffs , and so it was again on the final afternoon . A one-hitter must be a pitching story , even if that hit is accompanied by eleven walks , even if the other team wins , and even if everyone in the stands is driven absolutely bananas by the anxiety and emptiness and disappointment of it all . Mike Cuellar , the Oriole junkman , is fatuously slow starter , so no one was much surprised when he walked the bases loaded in the first inning before recording the third out . On this day , however , he never did find his accustomed groove on the outer fringes of the strike zone . Hunching his shoulders and growling at the home-plate umpire , he threw an intolerable number if near-misses and full counts , until at last , with two out in the fifth , he walked Banda , walked Jackson , threw a wild pitch , walked Rudi on purpose , walked Tenace by mistake , and was gone , responsible for no hits and no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the train 's only safety  --  a doubl. ? by Jackson that scored Bando all the way from first . Catfish Hunter and Rollie Fingers kept the door closed on the Orioles until the ninth , when a walk and two singles brought in the first Baltimore counter in thirty innings . But , with the tying run on third base and the Oriole fans screaming and weeping and pleading , Fingers fanned Don Baylor , to win the game , 2-1 , and wrap up the third straight Oakland pennant . California , here we came . THE Series was called to order be- fore the largest ( and perhaps happiest ) crowd in the history of Dodger Stadium , and in the midst of the liveliest kind of advance speculations . The Dodgers ' team statistics for the year were the best in their league , overall , while the World Champions presented more clouded data : the finest pitching ( by far ) in the A.L . but a flaccid .247 team batting average ( twenty - fiv e points below the Dodgers ' ) . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in home runs , third in runs scored , and first in stolen bases but the Dodgers had scored over a hundred more runs than Oakland . Hmm . The All-Cal final offered an even more vivid difference in personalities and living styles . The Dodgers  --  somehow personified by their shining new star Steve Garvey  --  were young , modest , articulate , polite , intelligent , optimistic , brave , dean , reverent ... They very much suggested a U.C.L.A. or U.S.C. varsity baseball team , and the campus image was reinforced by their gentle , fatherly manager and hy a front office ( or dean 's office ) that liked to talk about an ineffable , enlightened , shared motation pervading and guiding the entire organization  --  a spirit known as " Dodger Blue . " The two-time-champion A 's were something else  --  whiskery veterans , grown men , distinct and famously quarrelsome personalities , stars who were motivated by their own reputations and the team 's fame and success but also , quite openly , b money . Their manager , Alvin Dark , had brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fondness and respect for his predecessor , Dick Williams , and their bitterness over the meddling of owner Charles 0 . Finley , which had caused Williams to give up the reins . Dark , who is a devoutly religious Baptist , had nor had all easy summer of it ( " You could n't manage a meat market ! " team captain Sal Bando said to him one da ' , ) , and there were other causes for contention , including Finle ) ' s latest coup de tete ; the signing and use of an athlete who had never played a day in organized hall until he joined the A 's . He was Herb Washington , a world-class professional sprinter , whom Finley , via Dark , employed frequently as a pinch-runner . Finley , the inventor and promulgator of the designated hitter , is now campaigning to admit designated base runners to the game , and Washington was his showpiece , or puppet . Learning the rudiments of the game as he went along , Washington stole twenty-nine bases this summer , and was caught stealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by contrast , stole fifty-nine and was thrown out eightccn times . ) The company line on Washington , repeated at frequent intervals hy Alvin Dark , was " He won eight games for us this year " ? to which various old regulars responded with a muttered " Yeah , and how many games did he take us out oft " This dispute , h o w ever , barely quivered the needle on the Oakland seismic scale , and , in spite of the North-Jackson imbroglio , there had been some late-summer whispers that the A 's were growing More peaceable and caddlesome . This horrid possibility was done away with , however , when it was revealed that ex-Oakland infielder Mike Andrews had just sued Finley for two and a half million dollars over his forced rcurement during last year 's Series , that Catfish Hunter had commenced legal steps to force his contract release by Finley for nonpayment of fifty thousand dollars in deferred salary , and that Oakland pitchers Rollie Fingers and Blue Moon Odom had engaged in a clubhouse battle on the eery eve of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sprained ankle for Odom . The Oakland A.C. was ready to play ball . The opener , which the defending champions won by 3-2 , was a busy and absorbing affair , crowded with events and mistakes and discussable baseball . There was Reggie Jackson taking up exactly where he left off in the seventh game of last year 's Series  --  with a terrific near-line-drive home run muscled over the left-field fence in the second inning . There was Oakland pitcher Ken Holtzman , batting in his very first game- of the year , rapping a double to left  --  his third two-bagger in his last four Series games ; he proceeded to third on a wild pitch by Andy Messersinith , and was scored on a dandy suicide-squeeze hunt by Ca mpane ris . Dodger dash brought in their first counter : Davey Lopes , on base after a Campaneris error , flew away to second as Bill Buckner bounced a single over first , and when Jackson hobbled the hall ever so briefly in right , Lopes steamed all the way around and easily beat the throw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eighth , was pieced together out of a single , a sacrifice , and a terrible throwing error by Ron Cey . The young Dodgers , as flashy as they were Fallible , now produced the play of the game , when right fielder Joe Ferguson cut directly in Front of center fielder Jimmy Wynn ( who had a sore arm ) take Jackson 's high fly and then unfurled a rifle-shot peg to the plate that nailed the tagged-up , on-thundering Sal Ba.ndo . The Dodgers scored again in the ninth , Orr a homer by jimmy Wynn , and had the tying run aboard when Catfish Hunter , of all people , came in to relieve Fingers and fanned Ferguson for the final out . The Los Angeles fans went home stimulated and perhaps insufficiently troubled . In addition to the costly Dodger error and the costly wild pitch , there had been a mystifying failure of strategy after the Dodgers placed their first two batters on base in the second inning and again in the third ; in neither case was there any attempt to bunt them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Perhaps it did n't matter . It did n't seem to the next afternoon , when Don Sutton and Vida Blue faced each other before the same enormous , sun-drenched multitudes , and the home side reversed things , winning by 3-2 , for a split on the weekend . It was a quiet , minimal sort of game for most of the distance , with Sutton , now in quest of his twelfth successive win , having a hit the better of things . Vida , down by a hare run , gave up a single to Garvey in the sixth and then tried to throw an inside fasthall past Ferguson , who redirected it over the fence in dead center field , exactly between the two " 395 " markers . Blue threw up his hands in despair . Oakland loaded the bases in the eighth on two pinch singles and a fielding error by Dodger shortstop Russell , but Russell now took North 's hopper behind second , sprinted over and stepped on the hag , and got off a straining , anxious heave toward first , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , inning-ending Little League D.P. A better curtain was still to come , however . In the ninth , Oakland scored twice , on a hit batsman , an accidental , checked-swing double to left by Jackson , and a solid single bl Joe Rudi . Reliever Mike Marshall fanned Tenace , whereupon Mr. Finley , suddenly aware of a vivid opportunity , to trot his new hobbyhorse , ordered Herb Washington to run for Ruth . Washington now represented the tying run , and Marshall , who is known as perhaps the fastest pickoff gun in the iNest , sourly eyed him over his shoulder , exactly like Bat Masterson registering the arrival in town of still another uppity gunsel from the prairies He stepped off the mound three times as Washington , swinging his arms between his knees in a nervous , amateurish fashion , took up a minimal lead . Marshall then spun and fired , Garrey made the tag , umpire Doug Harvey threw up his arm , and Washington , figuratively shot between the eyes , lay twitching in the dust , as 55,989 Los Angelenos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Up in Oakland , two nights later , a pattern began to show itself  --  not just the third successive 3-2 score ( this One in favor of the A 's ) but something woven more subtly into the texture of these games . Some miserable Dodger luck was part of it : two whistling Los Angeles line drives were hit directly at Oakland infielders and converted into instant double plays . Contrariwise , with two Oakland men on base and two out in the third inning , Reggie Jackson barely topped a pitch by Dodger starter Al Downing , rubbing it feebly but luckily up the first-base line ; Jackson flung his bat away in disgust and raced for first , closely accompanied by Joe Ferguson ( on this day the Dodger catcher ) , who lunged fur the ball and saw it dribble off the end of his glove for an error . A run was in , and then Rudi hit a single up the middle that barely skipped under Lopes ' glove , good for another run , and only the third Oakland run  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up two solid solo homers  --  to Buckner and Crawford ( " I had some friends here from North Carolina , " Hunter said afterward , " and they 'd never seen a home run , so I gave ' cm a couple " ) ? but somehow it was Oakland that was now ahead in the Series . It was almost unfair . Charles O. Finley , it must he added , did not fail to intrude himself into the proceedings . During that third game , we could all watch him leading the home-town hordes in banner-waving , or , up on his feet , joining in the fervent singing of " God Bless America " during the seventh-inning stretch . Then , too , the public-address s3 , stein announced that Mr. Finley himself could be observed in his box , next to the Oakland dugout , in the very of placing a call to President Ford , in which he invited him to come and throw out the first bail at one of the remaining Series games . The President said sorry , he was busy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calling up ex-President Nixon  --  with the same result . The crowd loved it . ( Charles O. Finley , I have begun to think , may he the last of the true populists . ) Then , the ne't day , Finley abruptly benched and enraged Gene Tenace just before game time , replacing him in the lineup with another proti.g6 and discovery of his , also named Washington  --  in this case , ClaudeIl Washington , is twenty-year-old rookie outfielder , who , by the looks of him , may become one of the truly great left-handed hitters in baseball . i Charles O. Fink , have concluded , is never boring . ) Game Nn. 4 , both managers had stated in advance , would he the core of the Series , and its core inning , it turned out , was the bottom of the sixth . The Dodgers we re leading by then , 2-1 , thanks to a triple 1-i ) Bill Russell ; Ken Holtzman had accounted for the Oakland score with another personal editorial on the subject of the designated hitter  --  this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Oakland sixth may have turned on a trifling mistake by Andy Messer-smith , who made a bad pickoff throw that allowed North to move along to second base , with none out . Or perhaps it was Bando 's lucky , blooped , wrong-field single to right ( his first hit of the entire Series ) , or possibly the unfortunate walk to Jackson that came next . Nothing much could be done about the surprising but excellent sacrifice bunt that Joe Rudi now laid down ( Rudi bunting ? ) , which in turn , of course , required an intentional walk to the next man , and set up the only solid blow of the rally  --  a pinch single by Jim Holt . There was hardly anything to the whole business , then , except that four runs were in ( Was that right  --  Jour ? ) and the game , now somehow at 5-2 , was nearly , gone . It vanished forever in the top of the ninth , on a fantastic sliding , lunging stop by Oakland second baseman Dick Green , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ double play . These A 's knew how to execute . The pattern continued right to the end  --  a pattern of little Dodger mistakes , nearly forgivable errors or youthful lapses in judgment , and deadly , coldly retributive , winning play by the old and now doubly renewed champions . Rarely had any World Series offered so many plain lessons in winning baseball , or such an instructive moral drama about the uses of baseball luck and the precision with which experienced , opportunistic veterans can pry open a tough , gnarled , closed-up game and extract from it the stuff of victory . In that fifth and final game , Dodger catcher Steve Yeager committed a throwing error in the very first inning , allowing Bill North to move along to third , and to score , a moment later , on a sacrifice fly . Ray Fosse 's Isomer off Don Sutton made it 2-0 , but the Dodgers responded , bravely and necessarily ' , in the sixth  --  a pinch double by Tom Paciorek , a walk , a fine sacrifice bunt , a fly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit of the Series ) . The game was tied , 2-2 . The next bit of Dodger bad luck was not instantly recognizable , for it consisted of a brief final flurry of violence  --  a small shower of debris and bottleware from the left-field stands directed at outfielder Bill Buckner , which delayed the game for perhaps six minutes . The Dodger pitcher was now Marshall again , and , curiously , he failed to continue warming with his catcher during the delay , which was his privilege  --  and , it turned out , his bounden duty . The tiny omission was observed by the leadoff Oakland hitter , Joe Rudi , who cogitated the matter and concluded that Marshall 's first pitch to him would not be anything line and delicate- like a curve but probably a fasthall . He guessed right , pulled the trigger , and deposited Marshall 's delivery in the left-field seats , for the last and biggest run of the year . The last big play of the year came a moment later , in the eighth , when Dodger leadoff man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from center fielder Bill North . Nor content with this free trip to second , he turned the hag and raced madly on toward third , as Reggie Jackson , backing up , swiftly scooped up the ball and fired to the relay man , Dick Green , who whirled  --  the runner was by now no more than five feet away from third base  --  and cleanly cut down Buckner with a low , perfect throw to Bando , while Jackson and North exchanged delighted double-slaps back out there at the beginning of it all . It was a play to remember ( the throw from the outfield to third base is always one that sticks in memory ) , a play to carry us through the winter . Bill Buckner , I am sure , will remember it much longer than that , and so , too , will Walter Alston , and so will Sal and Reggie and Joe , and Rollie ( wh ? had been chosen as the most valuable player in the Series ) and Dick and Campy and Catfish , and the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gratitude and whatever other rewards they can extract from their inventor and tormentor and unique leader , Charlie Finley . Nor will Alvin Dark forget . In the lathery , liquid Oakland dressing room , Bando grabbed Alvin by the arm and pulled him up on the interviewers ' rostrum . " Come on zed here , Skip , " he said , grinning . " You could n't manage a meat market ! "
