David Galling , 24 , is serving seven to 21 years in the sprawling prison complex at Lorton , Va. , for assault with a deadly weapon and armed robbery . Like many convicts , all Gatling knew about the U.S. legal system until recently was that it had put him behind bars . But thanks to a promising new idea in prisoner education and rehabilitation , Gatling has become familiar enough with the law to see that it is not necessarily stacked against him , that it can be even-handed and may actually work in his favor . <P> Gatling is one of the 615 convicts who have graduated in the past three years from " street-law " courses taught in correctional institutions in the Washington , D.C. , area . The program is the brainchild of Jason Newman , 37 , a professor at the Georgetown University Law Center who believes lawyers must do more " to have laymen understand the legal system and know it 's there to help them , so they can use it and not abuse it . " <P> The prison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Newman in 1972 . It now provides such services as round-the-clock legal-aid units and high school instruction in legal basics . Street law , which begins its fifth semester next week , offers five subjects-including criminal and corrections law-at six prisons , youth detention centers and halfway houses . Impressed by the Georgetown program , the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration has provided $320,000 in federal grants for similar courses by other universities . Beginning this month , street-law programs will be offered in two California prisons , seven in the state of Washington and four in Colorado . <P> In D.C. , classes of about 25 inmates meet in spartan gray-walled prison classrooms for 90 minutes two nights a week for four months ; graduates get certificates . Courses are taught by two-member teams of second-and third-year law students , most of them from Georgetown , who earn academic credit for their work . The young instructors-most have never been inside a prison before-also gain insight about people who really need legal help . Says Jerry Kristal , a third-year student who taught last semester : " At first we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are human . " <P> Apt and Alert . Teachers lead the inmates , one by one , through specific textbook cases : " You are not married but are the mother of a child fathered by ... " ; " You arrive at National Airport from New York , and a policeman finds a pound of marijuana by searching your suitcase ... " The courses wind up with mock trials , in which the convict-students prosecute and defend cases before actual judges from the D.C. bench . Says Garland Poynter , head of education at the District of Columbia Jail : " Once you learn the system , you learn to respect it . It decreases frustration . " Thanks to street law 's practical and straightforward approach , even inmates with scant education often prove to be apt and alert pupils .
