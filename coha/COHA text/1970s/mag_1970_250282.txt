Tourist brochures fancifully refer to it as the " eighth continent , " a palm-fringed paradise of emerald bays , gleaming beaches and sybaritic hotels . Just beyond the thin strips of sand , however , lies a very different West Indian world , one of discontent and outright anger . <P> Listen to Evan X. Hyde , 22 , a summa cum laude graduate of Dartmouth who has become a Black Power leader in his native British Honduras-or " Afro Honduras , " as he chooses to call it : " You do n't dig living in houses fit for pigs , you do n't dig having to work for $20 a week so the white people and the corrupt black rulers can get rich . How long are you going to take this crap ? The white man is your enemy , and do n't you forget it . Tourism is whorism . I say live black . Black and proud . " <P> Common Element . The Caribbean region is being swept by its worst social unrest since the trade union troubles a generation ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social problems , " says Lynden O. Pindling , the black Prime Minister of the Bahamas , " the reincarnated forces of the 1930s have stepped onto the 1970 scene and are moving like a mighty avalanche . This avalanche is called Black Power - the Caribbean variety . " <P> Ironically , it has begun rolling at a time when blacks-not whites-rule in much of the area . This is true not only of the countries in the Caribbean littoral that remain colonial outposts of the U.S. , Britain , France and The Netherlands , but also of those that won their independence during the 1960s . During the past 18 months , riots or demonstrations have hit one West Indian land after another ( see map ) . The advocates of Black Power range from Maoists to religious fanatics , but within this diversity there is a common element of explosive discontent . <P> Afro-Saxon . In Jamaica , a sugar-plantation economy in which less than 1% of the nation 's farms occupy 56% of the total acreage , the sharp division between rich and poor has been perpetuated since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the prosperous and well-educated blacks and mulattoes with clipped British accents and comfortable homes in places like the Blue Mountains overlooking Kingston . On the other side are the impoverished , ill-educated blacks whose unemployment rate among some groups reaches 50% . <P> The rowdier members of this group can make West Kingston an uncomfortable spot on a Saturday night for a white tourist , or even for an affluent black . A riot two years ago took two lives and caused $2,500,000 in property damage . Now the government nervously bans the works of Malcolm X , Stokely Carmichael and Che Guevara , and forbids entry to suspected troublemakers . <P> Before independence , a Trinidadian politician named Eric Williams turned Port of Spain 's Woodford Square into a radical forum during the 1950s . This year militants again used the Square as a " people 's parliament , " but to denounce Williams himself , now the Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago , as an " Afro-Saxon " -a black man with a white mentality . The government 's arrest of 14 militants last April set the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's 750-man defense force ; it also led to riots in which four lives were lost .
