txt Letter : On the Monetary Crisis FRANK W. HOCHMANUEL F. KIRSCHTEIN , M.D.SIDNEY W. DEAN JR.KAREN DECROWTOM DEMA ... Letters - Health Care : Report From a ' Medicaid Mill ' To the Editor : You ca n't pick up a newspaper or listen to a news report today without hearing about how high the cost of medical care has gotten , or how physicians and/or health-care providers are " ripping-off ' the Government through " Medicaid mills . " As a physician who has been practicing in the South Bronx for the past 10 years , I find this very upsetting . Most , perhaps 90 percent , of the healthcare providers in this community are providing quality medical care to people who are in desperate need of it . I run a " Medicaid mill " and I would be very happy to have you visit and see for yourself the type of care I am providing daily . In trying to curb the cost of health care , the Federal and state governments have lost sight of the reality of the situation . Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being served ; the needs of the poor farmers upstate or in Plains , Ga. , are quite different . from those of the blacks and Hispanics and poor whites living in the South Bronx or Harlem . Only the health-care provider who lives with the problems every day and has to treat people on an individual basis knows what the needs of his community are . I believe that physicians and healthcare providers who are not offering quality medical care should be stopped and that health care can be provided economically and efficiently without reducing services to the patient . P.S.R.O. 's ( peer systems review organizations ) were established in the hope of providing health care economically through the evaluation of the quality of care being provided in hospitals . Although this meant more paper work for us and more stringent control over the care we could provide , we were still able to meet the needs of our patients . Now the Federal Government has gone one step further and within two years P.S.R.O. 's will have the responsibility for the review of both institutional and outpatient services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 'm not against physicians or health-care providers evaluating each other , but I am against the development of abstract rules and regulations that have not taken into account the needs of the people ' who are receiving the medical care . // Richmond Jon A Grievous Wrong ' Letter : On the Monetary Crisis We Have Lost the Luxury of Not Having to Export ' To the Editor : Morris B. Abram disapproves the E.R.A. boycott ( " Against Boycotting for the E.R.A. , " Op Ed Dec. 29 ) because he wants to reserve " forceful means for the most grievous wrongs such as instances in which life has become intolerable and experience shows that conditions can be improved in no other way . " Abram ( and the right wing ) tell us we women have Title VII of the Civil Rights Act . However , he is a New York lawyer who is included in the U.S. Constitution , and I am a New York lawyer who is not . That is a grievous wrong , intolerable to me ! KAREN DECROW Syracuse , Dec. 30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whims ' To the Editor : Your Jan. 6 lead editorial , " New Dollars , Old Problems , " is a timely and necessary comment on the severe monetary crisis afflicting our country . Yet it follows a conventional pattern with a serious flaw . That flaw pervades conventional thinking in Congress and the Administration , among the Establishment economists as well as throughout most of the financial press . Everyone criticizes and deplores Japanen and German exports , but nobody talks about U.S. exports unless it is to complain that other economies are not growing fast enough to buy . our goods . The hard truth is that the United States has lost , at least temporarily and perhaps pernianently , the self-sufficiency in raw materials which made it economically impregnable for so long a time . Not only does it no longer control its own supply of petrofuels , but it has surrendered its command of price determination as well . Consequently , it is in the same position as the other great industrial countries in ' having to earn the means to pay for its indispensable imports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ export , and instead we are forced to compete with other large world consumers for // Alon S. Wing a finite and depleting supply of raw materials . Having obtained a huge trade advantage through devaluation of its currency , the United States would be foolish and belie its faith in the value of the market mechanism were it to fail to exploit its new strength to the full . Your editorial criticizes Europeans for demanding that we restrain our economic expansion . Actually , that is not what they demand . Instead , they see a need for us to restrain domestic consumption . Like others , we could export more instead of consuming more . Exports create jobs every bit as much as domestic consumption , but with less inflation . American export listlessness during the past two decades has sapped the will and the skill to export and to compete , even now when terms of trade have become more favorable than in a very long time . Other countries have matched and often overtaken our industrial products in design , engineering and price worthiness . Their export @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as witness the extraordinary trade results achieved by Japan and Germany in the face of deteriorating terms of trade for them . We are wrong to castigate others for being such successful exporters , and it is nationally undignified for us to blame our woes and failures on others as long as there is so much that American business , in intelligent cooperation with Government , can do to help ourselves .

How to Raise $1.2 Billion For Public Broadcasting To the Editor : The criticisms of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting by Joseph Hughes , retiring director ( Jan. 7 ) , underline the grave imbalance between the funding of public and commercial broadcasting . Federal aid to public programming , even under the recent Carter proposal , would total only $50 million per year . With matching local station funds , the total might reach $165 million . These sums contrast with the $8 billion of revenue to commercial TV and radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The solution proposed by Mr. Hughes , to tax commercial broadcasting revenues , is correct in principle but inequitable in its application . The radio frequency spectrum is a public domain , like public lands , streets and waterways . Placing franchise taxes on the use of public domains for private profit is a universal policy for such uses as electrical , gas and cable TV transmission . Frequently , such taxes are earmarked for the support of general public usage , as in Federal interstate highway funds , bridge and canal fees . Users of the spectrum for private profit include direct revenue industries , like broadcasting and the common carrier telephone and telegraph services , as well as indirect revenue users such as mobile radio and private microwave where the value of benefits can be readily computed . In total , these combined revenue and use values approximate ' $20 billion per year . A standard 6 percent franchise tax would produce $1.2 billion annually . This amount would entirely fund both the programming and transmission costs of a national public television and radio system . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public body which is insulated from political and special interests , comparable with such public agencies as the National Science Foundation . SIDNEY W. DEAN JR . New York , Jan. 9 , 1978 The writer is a member of the Advisory Committee , Office of Telecommunications , City of New York . To the Editor : It is not surprising that Harold Jerry ( chairman of the Adirondack Council , a league of the more rabid environmental groups ) has found it necessary to defend Commissioner Peter Berle 's destruction of seven interior ranger cabins  --  four of which have already been burned to the ground letter Dec. 301 Mr. Jerry and Peter Berle totally ignore the advice and counsel of the career field personnel of the Department of Environmental Conservation who must assume the responsibility for search , rescue and fire-fighting operations when required . They ignore the pleas of the Conservation Committee of the Adirondack Mountain Club , whose thousands of members hike the Adirondack wilderness areas annually . Mr. Jerry and Peter Berle also ignore the admonition of legislative leaders like Senate Majority Leader Warren Anderson and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposed alternative system should be tested first and brought to the public for discussion  --  before the fires were set . The arrogance of Commissioner Berle in this and other actions is absolutely incredible for a state official . Both Mr. Jerry and Commissioner Berle have cited a quotation to defend these acts of arson in the Adirondack interior regions , saying these are areas " where the earth and its community of life are untrammeled by man ? where man himself is a visitor who does not remain . " Is it . possible that Mr. Jerry and Commissioner Berle are unaware ' that 85,000 hikers used the High Peaks region alone last summer ? Mr. Jerry wants " the imprint of man substantially unnoticeable . " I can assure you , the " imprints " from 85,000 hikers each year are certainly " noticeable " on the trails in the High Peaks . It is with great reluctance that I To the Editor : On Jan. 5 the Public Service Commission approved a rather drastic change in telephone rates for businesses in New York . The new rates went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so interested in the business community 's reaction that it allowed all Thursday evening for comment . The revised tariff will mean enormously higher charges for companies involved in short-range data communication . The increases will range from 20 to 1,500 percent , surely enough to make some of these companies consider leaving the city . Yet no study of the effect on New York business was performed prior to approving the tariff . I quote from Friday 's Times : " New York Telephone said that there was n't sufficient data on phone practices in these areas to gauge the impact . " I predict that companies will leave the city , expressly because of this new tariff . The P.S.C. has acted irresponsibly by accepting the new rate structure without even investigating its likely effect on the New York business climate . Tom DsMAnco New York , Jan. 6 , 1978 all voters in the state , hurt his chances of winning the city in this year 's election , by making a last-minute revision in his address . He declared that Federal aid was " clearly needed again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight to secure that aid . " How can Carey disregard Washington , which has repeatedly warned that a tax reduction by the state would not be looked upon favorably , as Congress considers whether to extend its program of aid to the city , and then turn around and say he will fight for that aid ? Carey 's tax cut proposal can be denounced for being political , but we can find no solace with the Republicans . The two men who want to challenge Mr. Carey for the Governor 's post , Warren M. Anderson of Binghamton , and Perry B. Duryea of Montauk , both attacked Mr. Carey 's proposal , not because it could hurt the city and eventually the entire state , but because Carey is copying the Republicans ' initiative in proposing a tax cut . The Republicans are exposing Carey 's proposal as a political move by declaring it to be a copy of their own proposal tend at the same time are telling us that we should appreciate the fact that they pulled it first . One hopes , for the sake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see through the politics and elect someone who will govern on the basis of sound decisions reached with only the people 's well-being in mind , and not their own political ambitions . The time has come to start judging our politicians for doing what is right , not what is politically favorable . THOMAS SLOME Hicksville , LI. , Jan. 5 , 1978 It is necessary for the layperson and the health-care provider to become actively involved in the rules and regulations presently being developed that will affect their lives . It is my hope that the New York State Chapter of the American College of Utilization Review Physicians will be able to work closely with the Federal and state governments in the implementation of future programs and will play a major role in guaranteeing that individuals will receive quality medical care whether they live on Park Avenue , in the South Bronx or in Buffalo . Although everyone has heard about all the bad Sings happening in the South Bronx , I wonder if they know about the good  --  doctors and healthcare providers who are struggling to meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " community leaders who are involved in redevelopment of the area through sound housing , cleaner streets , etc . I would like to cordially invite you to visit the South Bronx and see some of these things firsthand , meet the people who live and work here and see Prospect Hospital , which is an investor-owned facility located right in the heart of the community . The health field is changing daily and unless we know what is happening we will be lost . MANUEL F. KIRSCHTEIN , M.D. President , New York State Chapter American College of Utilization Review Physicians New York , Jan. 3 , 1978 City Exodus Promotion To the Editor : What happens to a state during an election year ? The state government is run on a campaign platform and the people suffer . Governor Carey announced his proposal for a $750 million tax cut , exceeding his potential Republican rivals ' proposals , and jeopardized New York City 's request for Washington to extend its program of aid to the financially ailing city . Carey tried not to let this move , designed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ response . The forest rangers , conservation officers and other field experts believe these facilities are essential to protect the health and safety of " visitors " in the wilderness regions . In the event of a forest fire , they also believe interior facilities are required . Well , I 'll side with the real experts any day before taking the untested word of our titled experts like Mr. Jerry and Commissioner Berle . It is reported that Commissioner Berle now plans to request funds in the 1978-79 state budget to replace these burned cabins with " peripheral " facilities . Aside from wasting ' the taxpayers ' money when he burned the buildings , Commissioner Berle is certainly presuming a great deal in betting that both the Senate and the Assembly will approve new funds for replacement facilities to satisfy his unproven warms .
