To encourage Americans to save and invest more of their incomes , Treasury Secretary William Simon last week proposed a sweeping change in the U.S. tax system : meshing reductions in corporate and personal income taxes to eliminate all " double taxation " of dividends . ( At present , a company pays tax on its profits , then sends some of the remaining money as dividends to stockholders , who pay tax on it as part of their personal incomes . ) Testifying before the House Ways and Means Committee , Simon said that his plan would eventually give corporations and individual investors tax cuts totaling $14 billion , starting with a $2.5 billion reduction in 1977 . The economy would benefit , said Simon , because the scheme would " permit industry the funds needed for industrial expansion . " <P> The Simon plan would work this way : corporations would receive a tax deduction equal to about 50% of the total amount of dividends they paid out each year . The individual stockholder would report as income not just his dividends , but his share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would then get a credit representing his share of the tax that the company had already paid . The net effect of this dazzlingly complex change would be to wipe out all taxes on dividends for a stockholder whose personal income tax bracket is 50% or less . The resulting savings , Simon argues , would be a powerful incentive for individuals in all brackets to spend less and invest more of their incomes , thus supplying the economy with badly needed new capital . <P> Few experts doubt that the U.S. needs to invest more of the national income . Its rate of investment , currently about 15% of gross national product , is one of the lowest in the industrialized world ( TIME , July 28 ) . But many liberals doubt that Simon 's plan is the right way to go about it . Joseph Pechman , a member of TIME 'S Board of Economists , says that the Treasury Secretary 's proposal " by and of itself will have very little impact on total savings . " Pechman contends that Simon 's plan should be considered only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would make up the $14 billion loss of revenue to the Treasury by raising the yield from other taxes . <P> Slim Chances . Democrats on the Ways and Means Committee last week objected strongly to Simon 's emphasis on lowering corporate taxes . Said Chairman Al Ullman : " I just simply can not adjust my thinking to a reduction of corporate rates that would shift the burden further to the individual taxpayers . " Another criticism is that Simon 's proposed reductions for individual taxpayers would make the tax system less progressive , by giving the biggest benefits to upper-income people , who own more stock and collect more dividends than individuals in the lower brackets . <P> Simon concedes that his program " is not good politics , " and its chances of being adopted by the present liberal Democratic Congress are slim . Still , his proposal should stimulate public debate on a long-neglected issue : how to trigger a faster rate of capital accumulation that would enable the U.S. to finance the myriad private and public investments it must pay for in the next few years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
