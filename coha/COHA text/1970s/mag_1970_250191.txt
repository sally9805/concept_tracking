Seattle-based Alaska Airlines counts only four jets and 13 prop planes in its passenger fleet , but it has more than its share of panache . Since 1967 , stewardesses have worn Gay Nineties costumes , and pilots have been required to sing some flight announcements to the tune of Calamity Jane . All that has changed . Now the " Golden Nugget " flights have become the " Golden Samovar . " Stewardesses in boots and Cossack minitunics serve borsch , beef stroganoff and " Bolshoi Golden Troikas " ( coffee , vodka and coffee liqueur ) from gilded samovars . <P> In June , barring any last-minute hitches , Alaska Airlines will become the first non-Russian airline to fly tourists into Siberia . Last week Chairman Charles F. Willis Jr . received an all but final go-ahead for the flights from Intourist , the Soviet tourist agency . Washington 's Civil Aeronautics Board has given its blessing for ten tourist flights next summer between Anchorage and Khabarovsk . <P> The tours promise something different for jaded jet-setters . For $850 , which takes care of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whirlwind eight-day tour of Siberia . It will include a flight with a view of the Great Wall of China , a banquet in Irkutsk , a hydrofoil trip on Lake Baikal and a visit to the Bratsk dam . For another $400 , the package will stretch to 15 days . Aeroflot , the Soviet airline , will take over at Khabarovsk and fly tourists to Moscow , Samarkand and Tashkent . <P> The tours are a first step toward Alaska Airlines ' long-sought goal of regularly scheduled flights to the Soviet Union . The airline now flies only within Alaska and between Seattle and Anchorage . On the strength of tourism and a brisk air-freight business to the North Slope oil wells , Alaska Airlines earned $554,000 on operating revenues of $36.6 million in the first eleven months of last year , compared with a loss of $4.3 million in the equivalent period of 1968 . Now that it is due to become an international carrier in a small way , its hopes for future growth rest on eventually providing-with Aeroflot - scheduled trans-Siberia flights to Moscow for Pacific Coast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
