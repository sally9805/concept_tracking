txt Early winter temperatures have dealt another setback to the already weather-stricken corn and soybean crops and , ultimately , the beleaguered consumer . " Here we go again , " said one agriculture expert . ' ' The cold weather has sealed the lid on our already depleted corn and soybean crop . " As a result , the prices of milk , eggs , and butter are expected to rise again in the next few months . But beef , bacon , ham , pork , and chicken are expected to drop slightly ? for now . However , in late winter and early spring , supermarket price tags on poultry and choice cuts of meat will join the dairy products on an upward spiral , crop experts are saying this week . Domino effect of corn Economists say the reduced crop will mean higher prices for corn . In turn , beef , poultry , and hog producers ? who use the grain for fattening livestock ? will reduce the amounts they send to market . That will mean higher prices in eight months when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold weather is also killing the green pasture lands of Wisconsin dairy country . That means the cows will be giving less milk . As a result , milk prices will begin to rise . According to George E. Hansen , supervisor of the Central Milk Producers Cooperative , a gallon of milk ? now selling in Chicago retail stores for $1.35 a gallon ? may rise by 4 cents as early as next week . Agricultural and weather officials say " a river of frozen air " settled across the upper Midwest last weekend . It apparently caused the loss of another 200 million bushels of corn . The figure on soybean loss is expected to be twice that . The unseasonable frost ravaged what remains of the corn and soybean crop in Iowa , and parts of Nebraska , Minnesota , Wisconsin , Indiana , Illinois , Michigan , and South Dakota . // * Frost cuts down U.S. harvest // The northern third of this year 's crop was pretty well killed by the frost , " said Lloyd Stuber , a crop statistician in the Iowa Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late planted fields . " In Des Moines , National Weather Service forecaster Paul Waite said the first fall freeze in central Iowa usually occurs between Oct 5-10 . He said the earlier fall freezes which hit the Midwest on Sept. 2 and 3 again last weekend , " occur only once in every 20 to 25 years . ' ' Almost complete failure Walter Goeppinger of the National Corn Growers Association said corn producers in the upper Midwest corn belt , hardest hit by the frost front , " are really paying the biggest price . " In many cases they wo n't get even as much as 20 bushels to the acre . In some cases there is complete failure . " Corn producers in recent years have harvested from 100 to 120 bushels an acre . The frost was only the latest slam at this year 's crop . First , severe spring storms had washed away much of the ' newly planted corn and soybean seeds . Then hailstorms forced many Midwest farmers to replant their fields . Summer drought erased a large portion of the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the crop in thousands of acres of prime croplands . Predictions plummet According to Dr. Goeppinger , chief administrative officer of the corn growers association in Boone , Iowa , the corn crop predictions have plummeted from an early spring estimate of 6.1 billion bushels to current estimates of from 4.5 and 4.8 billion bushels . In addition , " the percentage loss on soybeans will be more than double the loss on corn , " said Dr. Harvey Thompson , an agronomist at Iowa State University . The crop loss will also affect U.S. exports . It is expected to have a slight effect on the U.S. balance of payments . " We 'll be exporting fewer bushels of grain this year , " said Dr. Robert Wisner , an economist from Iowa State , University . " The volume may be down as much as 25 percent . But it will carry a 40 to 50 percent higher price . " In the short run , at least we 'll remain in roughly the same position . "           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
