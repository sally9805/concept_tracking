Lisa Cording , 15 , is a honey blond with a Farrah Fawcett haircut and big brown eyes . She is also so keyed up she can hardly sleep . Her hands are swollen from hours of baton twirling . The light fixtures in her bedroom and the family dining room have been smashed , victims of incessant twirling . Her mother complains that at 2 a.m. she can still hear the thump , thump of Lisa practicing her " routine " out on the patio . Lisa twirls in the bathroom , and once tried to twirl in the car . <P> The reason for this madness ? It is just one more day until Lisa and 200 other girls from 26 neighboring high schools will be judged at a regional twirling contest run by the Texas University Interscholastic League . The league sponsors 22 contests a year , and Lisa wants desperately to earn a top rating in Division One for her Little Joe flips , reverse figure-eights and , even more important , for a combination of style , smile and sex appeal that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would mean a chance to make the Huntsville High twirling line next spring . In Texas , being on the twirling line is about as " in " as a high school girl can get . " On Friday nights when the twirlers are on the field , you just want to be out there , " explains Lisa . Grins 16-year-old Robin Coburn , a tall , willowy junior who has already made the line : " It 's just a big deal . And your names are announced at the games . " On those Friday nights every autumn , high school football mania sweeps across Texas , consuming everything in its path . But unlike Northern fans , Texans never streak for the restrooms and hot-dog stands at halftime . They stay to see the marching band and , especially , to watch the high-strutting twirlers showing off flash , skill and baby fat in their tight , sequined costumes . <P> No one knows for sure why twirling is so popular in Texas and most of the South . Some say it is part of a vaguely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is encouraged by the warm autumn weather and a lack of organized sports for girls . Some feminists argue that in Texas more than elsewhere the preferred way for a girl to get ahead is to catch a man 's eye , and what better way is there than twirling ? Whatever its roots , the twirling line is as Texan as Lone Star Beer and chicken-fried steaks . <P> Lisa has cause for worry . Only seven girls can be chosen for the Huntsville twirling line , and competition is tough . Her elder sister Susan was a Huntsville High twirler for two years . But then the unthinkable happened . She failed to make the cut . Friends whisper that she gained too much weight to make the line . It was traumatic . " It affected Susan 's image of herself , " says Dick Cording , the girls ' sympathetic father , who is chairman of the philosophy department at nearby Sam Houston State University . As a result , he says , " we 've talked a lot about handling defeat in this family . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
