Carter okays a supermissile <P> The nightmare of America 's military experts , as they survey the 1,054 Minuteman and Titan missiles hidden beneath the Western plains , is that increased Soviet missile accuracy will soon make them all vulnerable to a surprise attack . Their answer : build a new missile that is both powerful and movable , so that the Soviets can never zero in on it . <P> Planning started eight years ago on such an MX , or Missile Experimental , but the weapon has long been surrounded by controversy over how it should be deployed . In underground trenches ? Inside airplanes ? Or moved around within a vast network of underground silos ? Nor was there even agreement on the missile itself . One Administration faction favored a longer , heavier version of the proposed submarine-launched Trident II , which could be launched from either sea or land . Still others , worried about the estimated $30 billion cost of deploying the 200 proposed missiles , denounced all versions . <P> The SALT II agreement permits only one new missile system between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his decision before meeting Leonid Brezhnev next Saturday . Since the Soviets have already complained about the MX as a provocation , he wanted to announce his move with as little fanfare as possible . So Deputy Press Secretary Rex Grannum last week merely confirmed previous press reports that Carter had approved the MX . America 's first new ICBM in a decade will be the biggest allowed by SALT . Weighing 190,000 Ibs. , more than twice as much as Minuteman , it will carry ten warheads ( compared with Minuteman 's maximum of three ) , the same as the Soviets ' main ICBM , the SS-18 . <P> Undecided until next month is the question of how to base the missile . The Air Force continues to favor a " shell game , " in which the 200 missiles would be randomly shifted by truck at night among 4,000 silos . One difficulty is that this plan would make it hard for the Soviets to verify , as SALT requires , that the U.S. is not cheating on the number of missiles actually in the holes . Also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then launch an attack , it would take too long to move the missiles . <P> The most likely plan now is some form of trenches , in which the MX can be moved around by rail . Each trench , about 20 miles long , might be " zippered " shut , so that it could be uncovered occasionally for Soviet verifiers . MX verification is imperative for the future of SALT , since any system that frustrated verification could presumably be duplicated by the Soviets . <P> Many residents of Western states , where the MX is expected to go , were leery of these additions to their landscape , especially after Air Force Chief of Staff Lew Allen referred to the area as a " sponge " that could soak up Soviet missiles , but the Governors of Nevada and Utah recently announced their support of the MX trenches . Besides , the U.S. has already spent $5 million on environmental impact studies for its new weapon .
