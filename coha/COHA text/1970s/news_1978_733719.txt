txt Letters Environment and the G.N.P . To the Editor : Robert W. Crandall of the Brookings Institution criticizes the Environmental Protection Administration 's industrial water pollution regulations as potentially too costly in terms of national output forgone ( letter July 3 ) . He scolds E.P.A . ' s Thomas Jorling for his " rather cavalier assessment of antipollution costs " as possibly in the " low billions " of dollars and finally invokes the authority of another Brookings economist , Edward Denison , to the effect that mandatory environment expenditures for business reduced " economic growth " by 10 percent of recent trend by 1975 alone ( " $9.6 billion , to be exact " ) . Perhaps , to borrow Mr. Crandall 's own language , someone should point out to him , and to Mr. Denison , that their thoroughly conventional estimates of gross national product are overstated , or meaningless , so long as they fail to account for the costs of present , uncorrected levels of pollution ? of air , water and industrial inputs ( the cotton " brown lung " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economist like Paul Samuelson warns students who use his textbook that To the Editor : In his letter of July 2 , David P. Asch delivered a hard right jab at Muhammad Ali for having said some kind words about the Soviet Union after his recent visit to that country . According to Mr. Asch , Ali is trying to sell us the idea that " Russian Communism is no longer out to enslave mankind . " Where Ali saw the Soviet people as peaceable , his challenger asserted that " a steady flow of Russian arms and propaganda is inciting the overthrow of legitimate nations in all parts of the globe . " He gave no particulars , but one wonders if he had in mind the fact that the Soviet Union is supplying arms to the African liberationist forces now fighting to overthrow white minority rule in South Africa . Saudi Reservation To the Editor : Amos Perlmutter takes the Saudis to task Op-Ed June 29 for not supporting Sadat 's position more fully . I imagine the Saudis have withheld full endorsement of Egypt 's strategy because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government has not indicated that it will trade conquered land for a secure peace . The Saudis want peace , but they also perceive the political realities of the situation . DIRCK WESTERVELT Schenectady , N.Y. , June 29 , 1978 Of Rents and Politics To the Editor : The trivial increase in permissible " stabilized " rents ( 3.5 percent for a one-year lease renewal ) announced by New York 's Rent Guideline Board points up the demagoguery and political expediency by which New York housing affairs are governed in this inflationary period . The apartments involved were built after any wartime emergency and were controlled in 1969 only because inflation required rising rents to reflect rising costs ; and our politicians acted as politicians do . It is to be hoped that the Federal legislators extending aid to our city will understand the wisdom of demanding a phase-out of such controls as a condition of continued Federal assistance , as logic and fairness are likely to prevail in no other way . DANIEL Rose Chairman , Housing Commit tee The Real Estate Board of N.Y . New York , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any such ' bads ' that escape the G.N.P . statistician whenever society is both failing to prevent pollution and failing to make power or water or air or cotton users pay the full costs of the damage they do . " Once we make these adjustments , " we see that net economic welfare grows more slowly than conventionally measured ) G.N.P . " Mr. Crandall 's reproof of " environmentalists who tend to view G.N.P . as a stock which does not change with increasing regulation " is another fine example of the tendency of orthodox economists to leap to policy " trade . off " conclusions without any probing of underlying economic relations ( let alone their broader political context ) . It also delivers us a more somber message : The efforts of big business to forestall , then undermine long-overdue pollution controls by holding back on capital outlays will usually be supported by appropriate " value free " pronouncements coming from at least some economists .

Du BOFF Department of Economics Bryn Mawr College Bryn Mawr , Pa. , July 3 , 1978 As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I applaud the Soviet Union for helping enslaved peoples in Africa to free themselves . And as an AfroAmerican , I keenly regret that my own country , which sends countless tons of military supplies to many other places , can not spare a single rifle for the Patriotic Front of Zimbabwe ( Rhodesia ) or for the SWAPO guerrillas in Namibia , who are arrayed against the Nazi-like regime of South Africa . As for Muhammad Ali , his peaceful remarks should not get anybody fighting mad . Before that amiable young man was born , Paul Robeson had similarly been impressed by what he saw as racial egalitarianism in the Soviet Union . U OYD L. BROWN New York , July 3 , 1978 The Junk We Breathe ' To the Editor : The June 28 letter by Victoria Shorr. extolling the pleasures of a cool June breeze on a night after a thunderstorm , was a joy and a delight to read . However , I ca n't help pointing out that what to Victoria Shorr is bliss reminiscent of the French Riviera may be anathema to individuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with asthma , do n't do very well breathing in delightful June breezes , ozone after a thunderstorm or even privet perfume ? let alone jasmine .

Would it were that the junk we breathe could be equally pleasant , and equally harmless , to all of us . But it ai n't . HARLAN R. DANtAN , D.I.D . Yonkers , June 28 , 1978 To Live in Egypt To the Editor : Egypt 's suggestion that the Gaza strip be " restored " to her jurisdiction assumes that its Arab residents would prefer Egyptian control to Israeli occupation . Does Egypt propose to offer the Arab Palestinians of Gaza the same degree of self-determination and civil liberty that her own citizens now experience ? MARTIN SAFIZ EN Rego Park , N.Y. , June 28 , 1978 Return Bottle : ' What Is Coke 's Message ? ' To the Editor : So William @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , argues that the returnable bottle would " never make any meaningful contribution to the solution of the litter problem " news story June 30 . I suggest that indeed Coca-Cola has little or no desire whatsoever to remedy the litter problem . First , the experiences of the six states which have enacted bottle legislation do not support his contention . Having recently moved to this fair city from Michigan , I can vouch for the impending success of the return bottle in reducing both litter in the streets and the number of bottles finding their way to major waste disposal areas . There have been , concurrently , no reports of rampant unemployment due to returnables in any of the six states that have been so motivated . Granted , the returnables are a burden on distributors and the public alike , but certainly no more than the tons of broken glass lying on every street and covering every square meter of park land are to the residents of this city . Second , the behavior of Coca-Cola and other major bottlers indicates exactly how concerned they are for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be purchased at a cost of $.33 per liter ( 33.7 oz ) plus $.20 deposit per bottle . In New York , however , 32 ounces of Coke will set shoppers back $.65 anywhere , unless they will buy the plastic bottle . Public outcry removed the plastic bottles from Michigan 's shelves within a week of their appearance . What is Coke 's message to New Yorkers ? Is this any different from the attempt many years ago at subliminal advertising ? Do n't the inflated prices set by both Coke and Pepsi for only their glass bottles reek of fair trading and restraint of trade ? It has always been difficult to quantify the gains from alleviating the pollution problem . The question is , Mr. Pearce , is Coca-Cola at all interested in making a " meaningful contribution to the solution of the litter problem " ? JEFFREY SILVERSTEIN Woodhaven , N.Y. , June 30 , 1978 Alaskans United To the Editor : Do n't let anyone fool your readers . Alaska 's U.S. Senators , Gravel and Stevens , are backed by an overwhelming of Alaskans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill now before the U.S. Senate . Why ? ? Because D-2 will lock up mineral and energy resources badly needed by the U.S. ? Because D-2 will close vast areas to any but that tiny minority who have the ability and desire to backpack into hostile and rugged country , denying it forever to anyone else . ? Because D-2 is by and for only the selfish interests of a small activist and vocal group of preservationists . Cunits G. SHATTUCK Juneau , Alaska , June 28 , 1978 Applause for the Soviet Union Philippines : U.S. Tax Dollars for a ' Self-Serving Dictatorship ' To the Editor : In his recent Op-Ed piece , ' In Support of Marcos , " Frederic Marquardt chastises me and 113 other Congressmen for writing a letter to Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos expressing our concern over repeated reports of violations of basic human rights in his country and our disappointment at his manipulation of the recent parliamentary elections in the Philippines . Mr. Marquardt argues that because no one was killed in these elections they should be judged an improvement over the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frauds in the counting of the ballots , " he suggests that since such practices have been known to occur in the United States they should not he criticized in the Philippines . Finally , he advises that we should let the Philippines return to democracy at its own pace and on its own time schedule . I find the first two arguments specious , and I ca n't help wondering whether the timetable to which Mr. Marquardt refers is that of the Philippine people or of Mr. Marcos . I believe these to be quite different . I think that the American people should he made aware of the fact that their tax dollars are being used to subsidize a self-serving dictatorship in the Philippines . ** Marquardt 's complaint that the U.S. does not " lecture ! " Red China 's leadership as it does President Ma rcOs conveniently evades this important distinction . I decry violations Of human rights in any , country , whether it be China , the Philippines or our own . However , I for one do not believe that we should ignore the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not have the leverage to bring about a change in China 's policy . Perhaps at one time mart ial law in the Philippines was preferable to the chaos threatening the country , but it hardly appears justifiable now . Today the Philippines is ruled by a regime which has indulged in torture and the incarceration of its political opponents , facts substantiated by Amnesty International . Recently , 75 members of the Jesuit order in the Philippines wrote a letter of protest to Mr. Marcos , deploring the fact that " widespread irregularities substantially affected the outcome of the last elections in the Metro Manila area . " It seems to me that one of the lessons of Cuba and Vietnam is that the United States is ill-advised to prop up repressive regimes . I thus feel that we have an obligation to question what is going on in the Philippines . And further , I believe that our initiatives have led to some improvements in that country . Ours is not a light interest in the Philippines . The bond of friendship between the American and the Filipino @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because of this special relationship , there is every reason to urge Mr. Marcos to implement genuine economic and human rights reforms which will benefit the people of his country and , if he chooses not to do so , to question the wisdom of continuing to support his Government with large infusions of American aid .
