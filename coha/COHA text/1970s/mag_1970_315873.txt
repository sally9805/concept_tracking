ALL things are changing , " Republican Leader Hugh Scott told his Senate colleagues not long ago . " And we are changing with them . Omnia mutantur , et nos mutamur in illis . " Right on , Senator Scott ! Congress may be changing , but at what a pace . About as often as the planet Pluto swings around the sun , Congress does indeed bestir itself , examines the archaic rules by which it conducts the nation 's business and gently blows away some of the accumulated dust of more than 180 years . But never enough to disturb one tradition - the hallowed rule of seniority-that has often prevented Congress , whether liberal or conservative , Democratic or Republican , from working effectively to represent the will of the electorate . <P> The effect of the seniority system on the Federal Government can be explained by three facts : 1 ) most of the real work in Congress is done in and by committees ; 2 ) the chairmen of these committees have vast , often dictatorial influence over the legislation that falls within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these chairmen have gained their exalted positions for the simple reason that they have been on their committees longer than anyone else in the majority party , which , of course , always controls the committees . The seniority rule thus gives the U.S. the peculiar distinction of having the only legislative gerontocracy on the globe . <P> A Greater Degree . Consider the results : twelve of the 16 Senate committee chairmen are 65 and over ; five of these are in their 70s , and one is 80 . Fourteen of the 21 chairmen in the House of Representatives are 65 and over , seven in their 70s , two in their 80s . The figures are comparable for the Republicans and will be about the same in the new Congress , despite the death , retirement , or defeat in the recent elections of several powerful patriarchs . <P> Admittedly , age is not an automatic disability . Some statesmen-like Churchill or De Gaulle-come into their own when those around them are heading for the nursing home and the checkers table . But one does not have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should not be the sole criterion for choosing the men who help determine the country 's future . <P> Despite some restraints instituted in recent years , chairmen on many committees still control the agenda and can bring up a bill at their own convenience . In some committees a chairman can refuse to bring up a bill altogether . Mississippi 's James Eastland , 66 , chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee and one of the most notorious racists in the upper body , has often ignored and sometimes killed civil rights bills by that method . Through similar control of procedures , Wilbur Mills , the Representative of a rural Arkansas constituency , has as much as or more power than the President in determining changes in tax , welfare and Social Security laws , simply because primogeniture has given him the chairmanship of the House Ways and Means Committee ( even his opponents , however , concede that he is able and conscientious ) .
