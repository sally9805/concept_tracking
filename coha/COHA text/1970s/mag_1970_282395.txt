COLD IRON by Robert Stone Pryor. 145 pages . McCall . $5.50 . <P> <P> Certainly sounds familiar . Listen : " O'Leary jumped around , thrusting his body at the crowd , throwing his hair back and reacting to the stinging high notes of the guitar with long , snaky shudders of his whole body . When he swung back to the mike , O'Leary had a red flower tucked into his pants , dangling over his fly like the nose bobble on an angler fish . O'Leary wailed into the mike ' Teach you how to ride , little girl , little girl . ' " Later on , O'Leary plucks the flower from his pants and unzips himself , to the astonished edification of the teeny-boppers milling around the stage . <P> Any resemblance to this incident and the Jim Morrison and The Doors hassle over a similar scene last year in Miami is probably a good deal more than coincidental . Cold Iron is a cool little novel about the rock scene , one of the few written with an obvious insider 's authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wild-eyed , stoned-out leader of Cold Iron , a West Coast rock group . Trying to avoid a bust for obscene behavior , O'Leary holes up at the Malibu home of his screenwriter girl friend , Woody Hagen , whose house is kind of an intimate crash pad for the neighborhood freaks . Not a good deal happens after O'Leary 's arrival , except that the gang gives a spying nark a tough time and both O'Leary and Woody stand to go to jail for a while . But they figure out a method to coast all the way : " If you go in , " O'Leary says , " I 'll keep you stoned the whole time , and you do the same for me . " <P> A good deal more could have been done in the way of such niceties as plot and character , but the atmosphere can hardly be faulted . That is not surprising , considering that Robert Stone Pryor is a pseudonym for Cecilia Holland , at 26 the well-known author of four well-wrought and successful works of romantic historical fiction : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kings in Winter , 1968 ; Until the Sun Fails , 1969 ; and most recently Antichrist , released this spring at almost the same time as Cold Iron . A former graduate student in medieval history at Columbia and a onetime clerk at Brentano 's Manhattan bookstore , Miss Holland recently moved to a commune in Pasadena , Calif. , having become deeply involved with the world of West Coast rock . Her former publisher , Atheneum , refused to publish Cold Iron , because the company felt the book 's seamier sides would damage the author 's standing with her regular readership . She then offered it to McCall , which brought it out under a nom de plume concocted from the name of her agent , Roberta Pryor . <P> The rock scene is an odd setting for a writer whose previous books have tried to bring to life Norman England and Hungary in the 16th century , as well as for a girl who grew up reading Gregory of Tours as a teen-ager and still holds a grudge against Gibbon for leaving the footnotes to Decline and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it wish fulfillment " she insists , talking of Cold Iron , " call it fantasy , but do n't call it autobiography . " The book took a year and a half to write and required 15 new versions . " Writing about history is easier , " explains Robert Stone Pryor . " You know what the results are . All you have to do is think back . " <P> Jay Cocks
