Toward a new constitution <P> " I hope it may be our privilege before I too long to welcome an independent Zimbabwe to this assembly as a full member of the United Nations . " That sentiment , expressed by British Foreign Secretary Lord Carrington at the U.N . General Assembly last week , reflected the optimism emanating from the third round of London talks on the future of Zimbabwe Rhodesia . The reason : a dramatic exchange of major concessions seemed to have brought a new Zimbabwe constitution almost within reach . <P> First , Patriotic Front Leaders Robert Mugabe and Joshua Nkomo surprised the conference by agreeing to give the tiny Rhodesian white minority ( 3% of the population ) an outsize 20% of the seats in a future parliament . The move clearly ran against their longstanding contention that such a guarantee would be inherently " racist . " Their grudging acceptance of it now brought them into line with the Salisbury delegation of Prime Minister Abel Muzorewa , which had adopted the 20% formula a week earlier . Then , with equally surprising magnanimity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand and announced its acceptance of internationally supervised elections . At week 's end only a few outstanding questions remained before agreement could be reached on all the provisions of a future constitution . <P> " All the sides are behaving as if there were no insurmountable problems , " a senior adviser to Muzorewa said in amazement at the pervasive mood of sweet reason . Even the militant Mugabe confessed that he was " cautiously optimistic " about the possibility of a settlement and graciously took Muzorewa off his personal list of " war criminals . " His conciliatory tone was shared by fellow Guerrilla Leader Nkomo , who told TIME 'S William McWhirter , " I would like everybody to be given a chance to contribute to a rea-soned-out solution of the problem . It is not the conference that has changed things . It 's the circumstances that have changed . " <P> Among these changed circumstances behind the Patriotic Front 's dramatic shift has been the pressure exerted by the so-called front-line states ( Tanzania , Botswana , Angola , Mozambique , Zambia ) , on which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with serious economic difficulties at home , the front-line leaders have been anxious for an end to the long and costly war and have not been shy about arm twisting . Warned Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere in London 's New Statesman : " If any wing of the Patriotic Front should develop doubts or hesitations about fighting such an open election , I would disown them and expect the rest of Africa to do the same . " In much the same way , the Salisbury delegation has been under pressure from Salisbury 's own patrons in South Africa , who have been actively pushing them toward compromise .
