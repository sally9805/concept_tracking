A chemical cousin of the PCBs has also been causing problems these days . During the past two years , some 32,000 cows , more than 6,000 swine , 1,370 sheep and 1.5 million chickens , not to mention considerable quantities of eggs , cheese , butter and dried milk , have been destroyed in the state of Michigan after they were accidentally contaminated by a fire retardant containing polybrominated biphenyls , or PBBS . Furious farmers , many of them near bankruptcy as a result of the poisoning , have accused state officials not only of failing to protect producers and the public against PBBS , but also of attempting to cover up the problem . <P> The PBB problem came to light in 1973 when Frederic Halbert , 31 , a Battle Creek dairy farmer who holds a master 's degree in chemical engineering , noticed that his cows did not seem to be eating much and that the herd 's milk production had dropped dramatically from the normal 13,000 lbs . per day to 7,600 lbs . When veterinarians were unable to diagnose the problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving calves feed from half a dozen different sources , he traced the ailment to a product purchased earlier that year from Farm Bureau Services Inc. , a subsidiary of the cooperative Michigan Farm Bureau . After spending $5,000 of his own funds on laboratory tests and long-distance phone calls , he learned that the feed had been contaminated by PBBs that had been inadvertently substituted for a mineral additive . Halbert had to destroy 800 of his cows when his herd was quarantined in 1974 . <P> Cover Up . Since the PBB contamination was discovered in Michigan in May 1974 , Farm Bureau Services and Michigan Chemical Corp. , which produced the PBBs , have settled 500 claims from farmers at a cost of $30 million . Some 300 more claims are pending , and even more may be filed . Though researchers have yet to make any direct links between PBB exposure and illness in humans , several farmers claim that they and their families have been affected by the chemicals , and have suffered from headaches , dizziness and sore joints . <P> Farmers angrily maintain that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is already being referred to as Cattlegate . Gerald Woltjer , 39 , who has lost 600 cows because of PBB contamination during the past two years , feels that the state agriculture department was indifferent to early reports about PBB poisoning . Other farmers are irate over the department 's decision to allow farm products with currently allowable PBB levels to be sold . Says Alvin Green , 58 , of Chase , who shot and buried 150 cows last November : " I do n't think it 's right to put this food on the market for human consumption . " <P> Agriculture department officials contend that farmers have exaggerated the extent of PBB contamination , and have used it in a few cases as an excuse for poor livestock management . They also insist they have found no detectable levels of PBBs in any milk , cheese or dried milk sold at retail since June 1974 . Governor William Milliken has moved to resolve the dispute by ordering an investigation . But even as the Governor 's probers were beginning their work , officials quarantined three dairy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
