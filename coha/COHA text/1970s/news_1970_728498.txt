txt The illegal postal strike is leading the nation toward a tragic confrontation that is as unnecessary as it is potentially disastrous . The way toward a fair and honorable solution still lies open : an immediate return to work , followed by top-level negotiations on wages and all the other legitimate grievances of the 750,000 postal employes . That is the sensible course agreed upon by Secretary of Labor Shultz and the national heads of the seven postal unions . Strikers in Buffalo and Trenton have had the wisdom to endorse that accord and return to work . But repudiation of the pact by union locals in New York and many other large cities outside the South seems likely to leave President Nixon with no option except to call out troops to move the mail . No one views that necessity with pleasure , especially since it is clear that most of the fault for the postmen 's rebellious mood lies with the White House and Congress . Inexcusable blundering in both branches of Government has forced postal workers to wait month after month for the long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agrees they fully deserve . The whole issue has been snarled in the interminable battle over postal reform , another matter on which the national interest has had to mark time while Washington played politics-as-usual . But the Shultz formula assures swift action to break the deadlock over postal pay . It is unthinkable that either the Administration or Congress would balk at confirmation of the negotiated settlement . All that is needed to get the negotiations under way is restoration of normal mail service . That is essential because of the mounting disruption the strike is causing in every aspect of American life . It is also essential , as Mr. Nixon has noted , because the Government can not negotiate under the club of mass defiance of Federal law . Disregard for orderly process already has achieved dimensions that undermine the nation 's integrity . The contagion spreads from ghetto to campus to agencies of government , sweeping aside all respect for law . The , mood of the postal rebels was well reflected in one sign at Saturday 's strike rally in this city : " We Have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The " them , " of course , is the Government of the United States . The country can not surrender to such a challenge . The mails must move , and Mr. Nixon has promised that they will move , no matter how much difficulty or discord attends this emergency effort . That is the only course the ' President can take unless the postal employes relieve him of the necessity by belatedly heeding the sound advice of their own unions . The leaders of labor have as great a stake as any public official in stemming the spirit of anarchy that underlies the postal revolt . The back-to-work vote in Buffalo and Trenton indicates that the situation is not hopeless , that the tide can still be turned . In this moment of crisis there is need for a final concerted appeal by the President of the United States and the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. , George Meany . Despite their political differences , they are the two men in the best position to bring home to the postmen the recklessness of persisting along a road that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just alternative is so ready at hand .
