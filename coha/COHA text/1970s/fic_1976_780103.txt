 | Even on this cold Brooklyn morning , her nose already red and her eyes on the verge of tearing , she avoided stepping on the cracks in the sidewalk as best she could . The girls in her class had said that when you step on a sidewalk crack you break the devil 's dishes . She was not quite certain , and she was too shy to ask , if that meant just the straight cracks between each concrete square or if it also included cracks within the squares as well . Because if it did , just that morning she was afraid she had already broken some of his dishes . She changed the blue plastic briefcase to her other hand . Not that it was so heavy , but even within wool mittens her fingertips became cold and numb , and the only way she could possibly manage on cold mornings like this was to walk with one hand in her pocket while carrying the briefcase with the other . There were , of course , other things to be concerned about on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her for the first month after summer vacation , had patiently taught them to her . For one thing , she was to remain on Avenue M and not stop until she reached East Sixteenth Street where Charlotte Bender , who was three weeks younger than she was and her third best friend , always waited for her . That meant she was not to dawdle in front of the shop windows on Avenue M. And it also meant that she was not to pick through the trash the merchants put out on the curb . The trash intrigued her . Sometimes it contained labels or wrapping paper or advertising signs with pictures on them , pictures of islands  | with palm trees , and of Eskimo children , and of mountains with snow-covered peaks . Sometimes there were beautiful silky ribbons and lovely colored paper and fluffy excelsior , all of which was fascinating . She could n't understand people throwing such things away , and the reason her mother had mentioned it at all was that she would stuff as much of these treasures as she could into her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school . Her mother had also told her to stay away from men pushing hand trucks across the sidewalk because if one of the heavy boxes fell on her she could be badly hurt . And at each corner she was to stop and look carefully in both directions before she started to cross to the other side . She changed hands again . She wished there was something that could be done for cold noses , too , and she covered hers with the mitten of her free hand before she plunged that hand into a warm pocket . One morning , two weeks before , while her mother was dressing her , she had asked why they did n't make mittens for noses , too , and her mother had laughed at that and kissed her on the nose and said that she was going to call Daddy as soon as he arrived at his office to tell him what she had said . " Hello , Marion . " She stopped and looked up . She had never seen the woman before . She was wearing a white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue slacks . Although blue was Marion 's favorite color , this was not her favorite shade of blue . When the woman squatted to be on eye level with her , she could see gray hairs curling out from under the babushka , black specks on her brown eyes and flaking skin on several parts of her round nose . Their faces were so close then that she could even smell the woman 's breath . It was a metallic kind of smell , and she turned her nose away slightly as politely as she could . Her aunt 's breath smelled the same way , and she wondered if all old women 's mouths gave off a metallic smell . " Going to school ? " the woman asked . She nodded bashfully , looking at the woman from the sides of her eyes , holding the briefcase up against her chest with both hands and swaying slightly from side to side . One other thing her mother had told her was to never talk to strangers . It was a very  | important thing , and her mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you like to ride the rest of the way with us ? " the woman asked . For the first time she noticed the big car at the curb , its door open and a man sitting behind the wheel . The woman 's smile sweetened then , and she could see that her teeth shone , that one of the front ones was gray , and there was a pinkish crumb stuck between two others . " My momma said that I am not supposed to talk to strangers , " she said . " What ? " the woman asked , still smiling , turning her babushka covered ear toward her . " Please talk a little louder , dear , I ca n't hear what you 're saying . " " My momma said that I was n't supposed to talk to strangers , " she repeated , louder this time . " But I 'm not a stranger , dear , " the woman replied . " I knew that your name was Marion , did n't I ? " She thought about that . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studied the woman 's face . This was n't the first time in her experience that a word eventually meant something different from what she had first thought it meant . It had happened in school . And it had happened with her friends . The woman put a palm to her knee and straightened up . Still smiling she reached out for Marion 's hand . She was wearing a worn black cloth glove that had been stitched in several places , but one seam threatened to split again . She thought about the word " stranger " again , then looked all around hoping hard that for some reason her mother might be walking along Avenue M. But her mother was nowhere in sight and no one else on the busy street was paying any attention , so slowly , reluctantly , she gave the woman her hand .  | God , it 's stifling in here , she thought . And the bed is so goddamn soft ! There was a rustling alongside of her , and the mattress sank a little . She turned her head and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He certainly did n't look fortythree . He was lucky to have the nice , even , Saxon bone structure , and his blond hair had probably always been on the thin side . He smiled at her and with his free hand pulled the snow-white sheet down just enough to expose her breasts . " Incredible , " he said . " Fantastic ! " He spoke English well but with a guttural accent , and he emphasized the r s and t 's . " You 're certainly the first one ever to call them incredible , " she said . " Never mind the fantastic . " And she reached up and stroked his sparse chest hair , some of which was gray . " No , no . What I meant was that just a few hours ago I was on this train to Copenhagen , not aware that you even existed . Now , what is it , three hours later ? Almost Christmas Eve and here we are in Hamburg , a city that I detest , among people that I detest , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by incredible , fantastic . " The very first thing he had said to her was that she should n't take him for a German , because he was Swiss . He touched her lips then , and she playfully grabbed his hand and bit the tips of his fingers . " AieI " he protested , pulling the hand away . " And what is even more incredible , more fantastic , insane even , is that you are not  | going to remain with me for one night . Is it the hotel ? You could n't find a better hotel in Europe than the Vier Jahreszeiten . Is it me ? I am handsome , mature , virile , not to mention wealthy . I am in the position to give you everything you could ever want , sexually , materially and , I might add , spiritually as well . Ach , you laugh . All right , laugh . But no , you , you have to meet Aunt Edna in Stockholm . This I do not understand . " " You are also a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And he waved his hand impatiently . " I believe in telling the truth . Modesty is for Americans . " She looked into his eyes , raised her hand to his face and then ran her fingers up into his thin blond hair . Using the slightest of pressures she pulled his head down and they kissed . There was little doubt about the fact that he was virile . When it was over she reached around and touched his back , and he twitched reflexively . She laughed then , and he rolled over to his side of the bed and covered his eyes with his arm . For several long minutes they lay that way , and there was nothing but peaceful breathing on that too-soft bed in that stifling room . When she got up he took his arm away from his eyes and looked at her , at her breasts and finally at her face . " So you really are going to leave me , " he said as though it was so hard to believe . " You insist , eh ? Tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damned aunt and say that you will be delayed , for an hour .. . five hours . . . one night . . . a day . . . a week ? " " No , Kurt , " she said , pushing back a moist strand of chestnutcolored hair from her forehead with the crook of her thumb . " It is n't that I do n't want to , but as I told you we have a reservation for Lapland and . . . Kurt , I explained about Aunt Edna . I just ca n't , as much as I would like to . " " First of all " ? he lectured , shaking his finger ? " Lapland in the wintertime is insane . Utterly insane . Do you know that ? No one visits Lapland in the wintertime . No one . That 's one thing . Number two is , why not have Aunt Edna come down here ? Or to Copenhagen ? As my guest ? " " Kurt , please . She 's an old lady , and she would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upset . It is n't as if we wo n't be meeting in London in ten days . "  | " Ten days ! " He shook his head in exasperation and rolled his eyes upward . But he stopped to watch her when she turned to walk to the bathroom . When she closed the door he reached for the ice bucket on his side of the bed , took out a glass and then a halfempty bottle of sekt , both dripping wet . He poured half a glass of wine , returned the bottle to the bucket and touched the bottom of the wet glass on his hot forehead before he sipped from it . When he lay back on the pillow again he held the glass on his chest . When she emerged dressed from the bathroom some fifteen minutes later he was asleep , still holding the glass to his chest . But he sensed her standing over him and opened his eyes . He put the glass on the bed table , sat , then stood up and put on a beautiful black and yellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordinarily begs , " he said , turning to face her while securing the belt , running his hand through his hair to straighten it . He reached out both his hands and held her at arms ' length . " But please do n't go . Get rid of your Aunt Edna . Call her . Tell her that you are sick . Tell her that I will rent a man for her , the kind of man , I 'm sure , you do n't find in Indiana . " " Kurt , " she protested playfully . " You are corrupt . " And she touched the tip of his nose with her finger . He pulled her to him and kissed her , once , twice , then again and then again , and there would have been more if she had n't pushed him away . " I must go , Love , " she said , straightening her clothes and fluffing her hair . He helped her into the coat , which was camel-colored and pea coat length , and carried her bag to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his arms again . " In ten days , " he said when she was finally able to wriggle free . " Remember , on Monday , January fifth , in London at the Park Lane Hotel . We will be registered as Mr. and Mrs. Kurt Ruter . Just walk up to the desk and ask for the key . If Aunt Edna is with you I will garrote her and throw her body out of the window . Do you hear ? " " In ten days , " she said softly , looking lovingly up into his eyes . " If you come across any erotic underwear in Lapland please buy it , " he added . She laughed and pushed at his chest with her free hand . They kissed several more times at the door and he remained half  | in , half out of the room and watched her walk down the thickly carpeted corridor . She stopped before turning the corner , waved and blew a kiss . He returned the wave , closed and locked the door behind him . At the bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a green velour hat , pacing back and forth , covering a distance of no more than four feet . He did n't look up as she approached , but when she was abreast of him he suddenly stopped , plopped the hat onto his head , took the bag from her hand and guided her to the first door on the other side of the elevators . He knocked but once and the door was whisked open . It was surprising that a room so crammed with men and cigarette smoke could be so quiet . Four of the men were in police uniforms , one in plainclothes , and the one in formal afternoon attire was obviously the hotel manager . On the bed were shotguns , boxes of shells , bulletproof vests , helmets , overcoats , an umbrella , several newspapers and one girlie magazine . " Ach , Miss Bay , " the stoop-shouldered man , Detective Inspector Sonnenleitner , said when the door was closed . " I was beginning to worry about you . You were in there with him for so long . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not as charming . She opened her coat because of the damned heat and waved a hand in front of her face to fan some of the smoke away . " These things take time . " " Good . Let us begin , " Sonnenleitner answered irrelevantly and turned to his men . She did n't understand German well , but at one point when she heard him say , " Fraulein Bay , " she smiled . No one returned the smile . When the detective inspector stopped speaking he turned to her again . " All right , Miss Bay . " " Ruter has two guns that I know of , " she said , looking.straight at him , all business , the smile gone . " Both are Sig 210 automatics . Both are loaded . One is in the drawer of the night table to the right of the bed as you enter the room . " And she pointed to the table in that room . " Do you understand ? " Sonnenleitner nodded . " The second gun is folded in a white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closet . " She pointed to the closet . " Do you understand all of this ? " " Of course , " Sonnenleitner replied . " All right . Now , my client 's securities , and what is left of the cash , are in the American-style attache case under the right side of the bed . Or at least it was there when I left him . Is all of this , clear ? " " Fine , " Sonnenleitner said . " Very fine . " She noticed that he had n't unbuttoned his coat or taken off his hat , and it amazed her that the heat did n't seem to bother him . She could scarcely breathe . The detective inspector turned from her , and his men gathered around him like chicks to a hen . All but the other plainclothesman gave him their strictest attention . He listened with one ear but watched her . His thick black hair was cut to brush length , and the long , slanted sideburns that came down and partially covered his sunken cheeks somehow seemed incongruous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nose , and as his eyes traveled across her face and body they reminded her of some double-barreled weapons system . Several of the uniformed men had questions , and Sonnenleitner answered each one patiently . When there were no more questions the one man still smoking a cigarette tamped it out in the already overflowing ashtray , and the detective inspector turned to Charity again . " Fine , " he said . " Very fine . Now , Miss Bay , if you are ready , this is what we shall do . My four men here " ? and he indicated the uniformed men who were now putting on bulletproof vests ? " they will precede us . One will take up station where the corridors meet . Two will take up places on either side of Ruter 's door . And number four will make certain that the guests in the two rooms at the end of his corridor do not stray from their rooms . Herr Berner here " ? and he pointed to the manager , who had a bewildered look on his face ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this floor , nor are any employees to set foot here until further notice . Now , when my men are in position , Segmiiller " ? he indicated the man who would be at the corridor intersection ? " will give a signal and the three of us will then proceed . Kruse " ? obviously the plainclothesman ? " you and I will go to the room . We will stand against the wall , out of sight , and you will knock on the door . When Ruter an- swers you say you think you have left your watch somewhere inside . Take it off now and put it in your pocket . Good . Stand where he can see you as soon as he opens the door . And smile . . . . " He smiled , then held out his hands sympathetically , palms up . " Ach , Miss Bay , I am sure I do not have to tell you how . When the door is opened we will take over from there . You quickly get out of the way in case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be . " At the mention of shooting the hotel manager gasped . He ran over to Sonnenleitner and spoke directly into his ear , his face pained , his forehead creasing almost to the crown of his bald head . The detective inspector listened patiently , considering the circumstances , then patted the little man 's arm reassuringly and politely pushed him out of the way . Sonnenleitner inspected the uniformed men before they left like a general reviewing his troops . He looked at their vests , their helmets and , for some reason , on both sides of their shotguns . Then he held up his hand for both silence and attention , moved over to the door , opened it part way and peered out carefully . When he was satisfied he opened it all the way and stood to one side . The uniformed men stepped out one at a time , like paratroopers from a plane , first leaning then whooshing quickly to their right as if into a slipstream . Sonnenleitner stood at the door and watched them . Kruse drew a Mauser automatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the magazine , examined it , then clicked it back into place . When he looked up it was at Charity and with a smile that did nothing for the narrow eyes . " We are ready , " Sonnenleitner said . When she turned she noticed that he , too , had an automatic pistol in his hand , a Walther model PP . They walked quickly and quietly down the carpeted corridor , Charity in between , turning the corner with almost comical paradelike precision . All the uniformed men were in place , all held their shotguns up against their chests in the position of present arms . When they were abreast of Ruter 's door , Sonnenleitner and Kruse noiselessly joined the men pressed up against the wall , and she stood there and waited until they were ready . When the detective inspector nodded she stepped several paces forward and knocked .  | At first there was no answer . Then a muffled " Wer ist da ? " came from the other side of the door . " Kurt , love , it 's me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . " I ca n't find my watch and I think I left it somewhere in the room . " She did n't look at the men flattened against the wall . The key turned in the lock and the door opened , first a crack and then a little more . " Darling , " she said , smiling , looking straight into his eyes . They rushed in then from both sides , Sonnenleitner pushing her out of the way as he passed , so hard that she stumbled back against the far wall . She did n't wait to see how it turned out . Her job was finished . But she could n't help thinking as she began walking back down the corridor that there was surprisingly little noise coming from Ruter 's room , much less than she would have guessed there 'd be . When she came into view the manager stopped his pacing in front of the bank of elevators and stared at her . She smiled to indicate that everything was over . " Your rooms are too hot , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Was ? " " Sehr heiss . " And she pointed at one of the doors . " Too hot . You give too much heat . It is very uncomfortable . " He continued staring at her , as if she was somehow mocking him . " Never mind , " she said , walking to the room for her bag , leaning into the thick smoke just enough to pluck it out . " Would you please get an elevator for me . It 's safe now . It 's all over . " " Ach , yes , " he said . " I am so sorry . " And he rushed to take her bag which he then carried to the house telephone where he barked a brisk command . It took only a few seconds for the elevator to arrive and when it did he stood to one side to let her walk in then handed the bag to the operator who looked to be about fourteen . " Merry Christmas , " she said just before the doors closed . " Yes , yes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Merry Christmas . To you , too , Miss Bay . " But he did n't put his heart in it .  | The airport in Hamburg was hot too and all but empty on Christmas day , and the first thing she did once inside was to take off her coat and drape it over her arm . There was only one agent on duty at the Lufthansa counter , a handsome , blond , north German type with every gene in place . He watched her approach with connoisseurlike scrutiny , first her legs , then her breasts and finally the face . When she stopped before him he rewarded her with a perfect smile . Obviously he approved . But the smile waned somewhat when in addition to the passport and ticket for the flight , she also removed a derringer from her purse , broke it open to show that both chambers were empty , and placed it on the counter . Regulations forbid the carrying of firearms on board airplanes . They must be surrendered at the check-in counters where they are registered , dismantled and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the airline , or customs , at the end of the flight . " You are much too beautiful to have to carry a gun , " the handsome agent said . His guttural accent had a slight British flavoring to it . " May I please have the American customs form for this ? " she said , ignoring him . " I am certain that all a girl like you has to do is smile to have the men come running , " he insisted playfully , Teutonically . " But a gun , rich , that is so barbaric , so violent . " " Why do n't you stop the nonsense and just hand me the form ? " she said wearily .  | The magnificent face blushed and the perfect eyes blinked in disbelief . " Pardon ? " " I just said stop the nonsense and get on with your job . For one thing , I am not a girl and I do n't like being referred to as one . For another , I do n't want to carry on any kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not my type . And if there is any objection on your part , any whatsoever , just cancel my ticket and I 'll travel with Pan Am or TWA . " The agent 's face was beet red by then . " Ein Moment , bitte , " he said , standing to his full height and then retreating through a small door in the wall . He returned a few seconds later with another perfect type , only one who was older and seemed to have faded as a result of being laundered more . " Miss Bay ? " the superior said , barely glancing at her breasts . " I must apologize if you have misunderstood Mr. Kauffmann . He did not mean to offend you . He merely meant to be pleasant . Is n't that correct , Hans ? " Hans , now looking hurt and abused , shook his head contritely . " It is the truth , Miss Bay . " She filled out the forms for the gun , which the superior took care of . He barely read them before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He did it with studied diligence , asking if that was all the luggage she had with her and did she wish to carry it on board with her . She answered yes to both questions . Hans then told her which gate she would be boarding from , and both men wished her a sincere merry Christmas and a good trip . As she walked away she knew that they were contemplating her behind , and she wished fervently that she could make it light up and say something like " Frig you ! " in German , whatever that was , or have it become a lighted , madly whirling pinwheel or , better still , a water cannon and shoot streams of water into their faces . " The T and A syndrome , " her old boss , Murray Wakefield , had called it . " T and A syndrome ? " she had asked innocently . " Tits and Ass . Your fits and your ass , and my syndrome , " had been the vulgar reply . Charity had been twenty-five when she had first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a one-man business , Security , Inc. ? Murray Wakefield had had a way with words . He was a stupid man in addition to being gross and vulgar . As a private in vestigator he had not been any more honest than the people he was hired to investigate . If he had not cheated his clients , he would not have been able to remain in business . And Murray Wakefield had assumed the hundred dollars he paid her every week entitled him to grab her T and A whenever he was close enough to do so . He also took it for granted that he could use her as the office jester when there were other men in the office . And he would curry favor with some of his clients by promising them dates with her . Ordinarily she would n't have stood for such abuse , but from her very first day on the job she not only knew that she was infinitely smarter than Murray Wakefield , but that with a very little effort she could become a better investigator than he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much as she could from him and , while his secretary , took and easily passed the California state examination for a private investigator 's license . She stole her first client right out from under Murray Wakefield 's nose , a firm of consultant chemists and engineers that he had been bilking for years . They were in need of a system that would ensure the safety of commercial secrets entrusted to them . She was able to devise a dual system that carefully screened all personnel , those already employed as well as those hired temporarily for specific projects , and a means by which department heads could keep a constant watch on all confidential information given them . So pleased were they with the system they offered a handsome retainer to monitor it regularly , which was enough to both cover all the expenses of her new office and provide a substantial profit as well . Murray Wakefield 's reaction to all of this was to tell everyone he knew that Charity was lousy in bed , which was a lie . Her career grew quite rapidly from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman investigator , was unique in and around the San Francisco Bay area and surprisingly very much in demand . Those who hired her , both men and women , found her bright , accommodating , thorough and tenacious . She was almost a complete departure from most of the male investigators they had dealt with , many of whom were ex-policemen , many of them ig- noramuses , not to mention gross , vulgar and dishonest , like Murray Wakefield . Some of her women clients told Charity that male investigators tended to intimidate them because they were women . And many , caught up in the popular American myth of investigator as irresistible sex object , had grabbed for the T and A. She had to change planes at Cologne . Though there were only two other people in the first-class compartment , both chose to sit near her : a middle-aged American business type with a huge cigar sat immediately in front after giving her several meaningful looks , while the other , a beefy body in an expensively tailored , graystriped suit , took the seat next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a defense against such an eventuality . " Beastly planes , rather travel by ship anytime , I say , those are nice shoes  --  Gucci ? ? used to design shoes myself at one time , would you care for a drink ? Name 's Fony Toster " ? though that could have been " Tony Foster " ? all strung together in one breath , obviously meant as her engraved invitation to Paradise . " Look , " she said , turning toward the rice-pudding face . " I do n't mean to be rude , but I am very tired . I have worked hard during the past week , and I am counting on this flight to catch up on some of my sleep . " " I say , " he said , attempting to patch the puncture with a devastating smile , showing the obligatory bad tooth in the typical British mouth . " What kind of work do you do ? " The tycoon in the seat in front , who had obviously been listening , got up then and sauntered suavely toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plane arrived at Kennedy Airport . Despite repeated and almost heroic attempts she had not been able to sleep during the flight , and when she stepped into the terminal building she was exhausted and edgy . The customs officer asked to see a license for the derringer before he returned it , saying , " I hope women 's lib has n't come to this . " And looked at her breasts . The taxi to Manhattan was driven by a tall , fierce-looking black man who turned unashamedly to stare at her exposed thighs as she maneuvered herself into the cramped rear seat . He continued examining her in the rearview mirror as they drove off . " Just come in from Paris ? " he asked when they were out of the airport and had entered the Van Wyck Expressway .  | " No . " " When my women are good to me I take them on a long weekend to Paris , " he said into the mirror . " Go maybe five , six times a year . You like Paris ? " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the dispirited borough of Queens speeding by outside the window . " I 'm a leg man , " the driver continued , undaunted . " I 've studied legs , that 's the first thing I look at in a chick . I 'm a painter , you know , an artist . I only push this hack for a living . So I know my anatomy , muscles , you know , everything . There 's few chicks that 's got the kinds of legs I like . You got the kind I like . " They arrived in front of her apartment building on East Eightythird Street at almost six-thirty . When the driver turned to collect his fare he again looked up her skirt . She gave him a twenty-dollar tip . At first he could n't seem to believe it . Then he smiled . But by the time she was stepping from the cab he had come to the conclusion that he had been insulted , which is what she had intended . " Fucking honky bitch , " he shouted as she slammed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to take her bag . " Merry Christmas , Miss Bay , " he said . " Did you have a pleasant trip ? " She had been away for more than two weeks , and she could all but see Mr. Horvath 's mind 's eye scanning the Christmas tribute list to see if her name had a check mark next to it . She had never paid , but they tried every year . " Do you want your mail now , Miss Bay , or shall I bring it up later ? " he asked , all pussy-mouthed . " I 'll take it with me , " she answered . The mail was tied neatly with a large red ribbon , and the attached card said , " Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year from the Boys . " The apartment , which consisted of two rooms , a small narrow kitchen , bathroom and windows that faced the windows of another , similar building , was on the twelfth floor . She had first seen it while the previous tenant was still living in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same people who did Dachau , " at the time , and she always seemed to remember that when she returned from an assignment . The air was stale when she opened the door , but she would soon  | acclimate to it and think that that was what all air was like . She dropped the mail , her purse and bag on the floor , kicked off her shoes and hung the coat in the hall closet . The television set in one of the neighboring apartments was blasting " Silent Night . " Though she seldom used the apartment telephone for business calls , she was too tired to go down again and search for a public booth . She dialed her answering service and asked a voice named Phil to give her only the urgent messages now and mail the rest . " Merry Christmas , Miss Bay , " Phil managed to sneak in before checking her box . " One very urgent , ' Miss Bay , " he said when he came back on the line . " A Mr. Sylvan Addabbo , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , o  --  got that ? ? has called every day for the past week asking that you contact him immediately upon your return  --  that 's his exact words  --  day or night . His home number is  --  you got a pencil handy ? ? okay , his home number is 555-8391 ? got that ? ? his office number is 555-4200 ? got all of that ? Okay , that 's all the urgents , I 'll mail the rest . Merry Christmas , Miss Bay . " She looked the name Sylvan Addabbo up in the Manhattan telephone book . He was a lawyer with an office at i West Fortyseventh Street . His residence was on University Place . She wrote down both addresses on the back of an envelope . She called her parents , using the bathroom extension and a conference attachment , up to her neck in warm water , her head resting comfortably on a bath pillow . Her father picked up the phone . " Charity ? Is that you , Charity ? We seem to have a bad connection , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bathtub , Daddy . I 'm using a conference attachment which is probably what 's causing the echo . Merry Christmas . How are you ? Is Mother all right ? " " I have my good days and I have my bad days . But your mother is as healthy as a horse . Is anything wrong , Charity ? " " Nothing wrong except that I have n't had time to send presents this year , and I just wanted to call and wish you a Merry Christmas . " " But you 've never sent presents , and only twice that I remember have you sent cards . Are you sure nothing 's wrong ? " It was all her mother could do to wrest the telephone away from  | her husband . She wanted to know if Charity had been away , and where . Europe ? Had she met any nice young men there ? She spoke with her parents for more than twenty minutes , turning the hot-water spigot on and off with her big toe . The conversation was mostly one-sided , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bits of native wisdom they had been accumulating like barnacles over the years . She found it simpler to listen and say very little . Her feelings toward them were at best complex , something she only partially understood . For one thing they disapproved of her being a private investigator , even though she sometimes earned as much as five times what her father had ever earned working for a firm of wholesale grocers before his retirement to Cape Cod . But they were warm , honest people and accepted her in their own way , which was something she had yet to find anywhere else . When she hung up the telephone she felt better for having talked with them . When she got out of the tub she put on a pair of bright blue pajamas and a warm comfortable white corduroy robe . She went through the mail quickly , throwing away the Christmas cards along with the junk mail unopened , separating the checks and setting aside the letters that required answers . Then , even though she was n't in the mood , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and jogged in place for a few minutes , hoping it would relax her enough so that she could fall asleep . But her joints seemed stiff and her muscles rebellious so she soon gave up the effort and brewed a pot of tea and ate several chocolate cookies of which she maintained a rather large inventory for someone not in the trade . She set the alarm for seven before slipping into bed and then found that she had anticipated correctly , it was almost impossible to fall asleep .  | She slept badly . There were long periods of struggling to keep her eyes closed and her mind clear of unimportant things that kept popping to the surface , then the brief , blessed , interludes when she actually did drop off only to be awakened by the sound of a jet plane or a police or fire Klaxon . At about five-thirty she gave up the struggle and stood dopily and with puffed eyes under the vicious fluorescent light , staring at herself in the bathroom mirror . She decided , as she usually did under such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if she had been given a choice she would have preferred bright blue or green eyes rather than the dark brown she had been given , and that it was time to let her hair grow long . She was getting tired of wearing bangs . She splashed her face and submerged her elbows and then her wrists in cold water , but it did little good , she still felt tired , wretchy . She took off her pajama top to do some stretching exercises on the living-room rug , then jogged in place for a few minutes . She only began to feel a little better after she had eaten a quick breakfast of canned peaches , tea , and chocolate cookies . But there was still a leaden area behind her eyes where she always felt her deepest fatigue . She dressed after that , putting on a greenish tweed suit more warm than chic and comfortable low-heel shoes . Before she went out she transferred things from the purse she had carried the day before . There would be no need for a gun , so she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the drawer where she kept two other handguns and several boxes of ammunition . When she was  | ready she wrapped a tan cashmere scarf around her neck , put on a matching beret , and slipped into a heavy , brown , fleece-lined suede coat . It was just getting light when she reached the street , and freezing . She had to walk to Second Avenue before she fpund a taxi . She had the driver let her off at a pair of telephone booths on Eighth Street and University Place . It seemed colder inside the booth than out and she had to take off a glove to insert the dime and dial the number . After ringing six times a sleepy woman 's voice came on and mumbled something close to " Hello ? " " This is Miss Bay . May I please speak to Mr. Addabbo ? " " Who ? " " Mr. Addabbo . " " No , I mean who is this calling ? " " Miss Bay . Charity Bay . Mr. Addabbo wants to speak with me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet . Mr. Addabbo . . . my husband ... I am Mrs. Addabbo . . . he is still sleeping " " I 'm sorry to have awakened you , Mrs. Addabbo . But your husband left word for me to call him as soon as possible . Would you please tell him that I am on the line ? " " Well . . . hold on , please . " She huddled as far into the coat as she possibly could and wrote her initials on the breath-fogged window . Addabbo came on coughing heavily and trying to clear mucus from his throat . " Agh , thank you for calling , Miss Bay . " He had a high-pitched and somewhat reedy voice , and he was trying very hard to sound fully awake and alert . " Agh , could you please hold on for another few seconds while I take this on an extension ? Thank you . " He was gone for more than a few seconds . The sun was up now , and the street traffic was becoming heavier . She shivered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which were so cold that when the recording came on to ask for five cents for the next three minutes it was all she could do to maneuver the nickel into the slot . Then he was on the line again . " I 'm sorry to have kept you waiting , Miss Bay . I have been trying to contact you for more than a week . I asked your service for a number to reach you , but they said they did n't have one . I would like to speak with you , that is , in person , the sooner the better . "  | " I 'm calling from a booth on Eighth Street and University Place and if you do n't mind I 'd like to come up now and we can discuss whatever it is you wanted to see me about . " There was a pause . " Right now ? It 's . . . why , it 's . . . agh . . . barely seven and I have n't even ? " He began coughing and placed his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then coughed still again . " So long as you are already in the neighborhood I do n't see why . . . . We are in penthouse A. Do you have the address ? I will notify the doorman that I am expecting you . " The building was an older one . Its lobby was warm , spacious , comfortably decorated and furnished , and immaculate . The doorman had in his youth been a boxer . He had a splayed nose , an ear that looked like tree fungus and eyes that searched for the weakness in her defense as he escorted her to the elevator and pressed the button for her . Penthouses A and B occupied one floor . There was a scurrying behind the door when she rang the bell , but almost a minute passed before it was opened . " Miss Bay ? Wo n't you please come in ? Here , let me help you with those . Is it very cold out ? " He was wearing a maroon smoking jacket over a pair of razorpressed , blue-striped pants and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be in his mid-fifties . He was of average height , had gray wavy hair and a sort of flabby circular face , one circle within the other , his nose in the exact middle . His eyes were very bright and very intelligent . She also noticed that he had managed to shave in the short time it had taken her to come up . She might not have been aware of it if he had n't nicked himself twice on the chin flab and if the blood had n't smudged the pale yellow ascot he wore around his neck . " This way , please , " he said politely after he had hung her things in a closet behind a concave door . He led her into a huge , partly oval duplex room with a spiral staircase leading to a balcony that ran along the oval . The staircase had a graceful and pleasing twist to it , and the steps were carpeted in crimson . There was only one window in the room and that took up most of the north wall . Through it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings began and then the forest of them further on . Addabbo mo- tioned toward a peach-colored silk couch . When she sat she sank into a seemingly bottomless cushion . " My wife 's making us some coffee , " he said , seating himself at the other end . " The maid does n't get here much before ten . " , She smiled and said that if it was n't too much trouble she would prefer tea , and he had to extricate himself from the couch , walk to the pair of swinging doors near the foot of the stairs and put his head through them to tell his wife . He returned to the same spot , reached for a carved-ivory cigarette box on the glass table and , opening it , offered her one . " Thank you , but I do n't smoke , " she said , hoping he 'd take the hint . " You do n't mind if I do ? " he asked , missing it completely , not even waiting for her answer but putting a cigarette greedily between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I would appreciate it very much if you did n't . " A shadow of annoyance passed over his face , but he quickly corn . himself and placed the cigarette and lighter back on the ble . " I must be frank , " he said . " I must admit that I would have ap ? eciated it if you had given me a few more minutes ' warning that ou were coming . " She guessed that he was more angry at not being able to smoke than her telephoning him early in the morning . " Well , " he said when it was obvious that she was n't going to answer . " I called you because , of course , I need you , need your services . That is , my clients need you . You may or may not have heard of me . I 'm a lawyer and my practice is almost exclusively with the diamond trade . The reason I thought you might have heard of me is that most people who have worked for the large insurance companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because I made inquiries about you before I called . I might add that you come with the highest recommendations . " She smiled . " I 'm sorry , but I have n't heard of you . " " Well , no matter . Let me tell you a little about my clients . They ale what is important in this particular situation . The people I represent , together , account for perhaps three-quarters of all the wholesale diamond business done in New York City . For all intents  | and purposes that also means the entire country , with Canada thrown in . Now you 've probably seen in the newspapers , or heard on television , that within the past two weeks two diamond dealers have been killed and close to three-quarters of a million dollars ' worth of rough , that is uncut stones , stolen . " " I 've been out of the country , " she said . " I had n't heard . " " Well , we 'll go back to the specifics later . Neither of the dead men were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel threatened . They are that big , that whatever happens within or to the industry affects them . There are matters of personal safety , of price , of insurance which , to diamond people , is always difficult to come by and costly . And there is the very important matter of , shall we say , public relations . To put it bluntly , we do n't want the outside world to know how really easy it is to steal diamonds . But that 's another story . What we want from you , if you are able to accept the job , is to quickly and quietly find out who is behind these thefts and murders . We feel , and the police feel , that the same person , or persons , are responsible for both of them . And we also feel that the chances are that they will try again . " " I was just going to ask you about the police , " she said . " Why not let them look for your crooks ? That 's what they 're there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Miss Bay , let 's not be naive . You know and I know that the police in this city , and probably everywhere else in the world , are limited . We have a liaison with the police department . We get from them , we think , all that they are capable of giving us . But we feel that is not enough . By hiring someone like yourself to work exclusively on our problem we will have more of a chance of getting this thing over with as quickly as possible . What will it cost us , one hundred dollars a day , two hundred ? It 's worth every penny . " " My fee is three hundred dollars a day , " she said . " Plus expenses . But . . . . Just then the swinging doors of the kitchen parted and Mrs. Addabbo backed into the room , carrying a loaded tray . Even at that time of the morning she had put on subdued eye shadow . She smiled at Charity when their eyes met and tried her best not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet to take the tray from his wife and in- troduced Charity at the same time . Charity thanked her for making tea , and Mrs. Addabbo said that it was her pleasure . She might have said more if her husband had n't caught her eye ; she then excused herself and returned quickly to the kitchen . Charity declined toast and said that she liked lemon but no sugar for her tea . The two of them sat without speaking for several minutes , Addabbo hungrily gulping down two slices of buttered toast with his cup of black coffee . The way he ate seemed incongruous with his appearance , a sort of atavism . When he put the empty cup down he carefully patted his mouth with a napkin , which further added to the incongruity . " Well , Miss Bay , can you accept the assignment ? Are you free ? " " Yes , I 'm not working on any other case at this time . But I still have some doubts in my mind . For one thing , if the police ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chances are that I wo n't be able to either . My resources , especially when compared to theirs , are practically nil . I do n't have access to laboratories , criminal files , for example . My strong suit is shoe leather . I have no one to help me . I work more or less alone . " " Charity . May I call you Charity ? For three hundred dollars a clay I should be able to call you by your first name . I can promise you that you will have access to everything the police laboratories come up with , to all of their criminal files  --  in short , to complete cooperation from them . The important thing is to find out who 's behind this and find it out quickly . We are very vulnerable , more vulnerable than anyone , even the greatest of thieves , realize . The world of diamonds is very small . The production and prices are controlled by a handful of men in South Africa and London , which is the only way diamonds can retain their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is concentrated on one block , West Fortyseventh Street between Fifth and Sixth avenues . Diamond people are clannish , close-knit in their own way . Most of them , the vast majority of them , are Jews , and most know each other , at least by sight , or at the very least one diamond man can recognize another diamond man when he sees him . " That 's the reason why these two thefts and murders are so ominous . Both victims had recently been to London where they purchased rough , which is what uncut stones are called . One was  | just off the airplane . Only people within the diamond business could have possibly known or guessed this . So that the crook or crooks are either members of our industry or are being advised by someone who is . We feel , and the police feel , that it could happen no other way . It has happened twice , it will happen again . That 's why we want  --  we need  --  someone like you . " " Mr. Addabbo , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How did you come to pick me ? " But he had gotten to his feet and was clawing for the cigarette and lighter . " Please excuse me , dear . But I must have a cigarette . I will smoke it in the kitchen . " She disliked being called " dear " by clients .  | Some ten times a year a select group of approximately two hundred of the world 's diamond merchants  --  manufacturers , important retailers and brokers  --  travel to the London office of the Diamond Trading Company for what are called " sights , " the sale or , more correctly , allocation , of uncut stones . The Diamond Trading Company is an arm of the Central Selling Organization , which , in turn , is a cooperative of the major diamond producers , notably the DeBeers group . The Diamond Trading Company handles only gem diamonds , as opposed to industrial diamonds , and it is estimated that close to eighty percent of the rough gemstones that are added to the world inventory each year are distributed through it , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the diamond trade , is privileged . Upon their arrival in London these few selected and invited buyers are given parcels of stones which have been made up beforehand , as close to their individual needs as is possible . Buyers can and do examine each stone allotted to them and they can , and some sometimes do , dispute the value the Diamond Trading Company has set on them . But no buyer ever makes his own selection . This method of releasing uncut diamonds has been in existence since 1934 and has been found to be an extremely effective way of controlling what otherwise would certainly be an erratic market . Monroe Silber , a diamond dealer with offices at 10 West Fortyseventh Street , was one of the few American merchants who were privileged to buy rough directly from the Diamond Trading Company . Silber had no manufacturing facilities of his own . His prac- lice was to contract out to one of the many excellent cutters on Forty-seventh Street those few quality stones in his allotments that he deemed large enough and of sufficient quality for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a handful of the nation 's top retail jewelers . The rest of his allotment was easily sold , at a good profit , to those merchants who were not as fortunate as he was . Ordinarily a dapper individual , when Silber traveled to London he wore as plain and as uninteresting clothes as he could bring himself to wear . A tall man with a pendulous nose and earlobes , with the few remaining hairs plastered straight back over his head in the manner of a stringed instrument , Silber left Kennedy Airport on Monday , December ii , at 10 P.M. on board BOAC Flight 5o6 , and had arrived in England at 9:50 the following morning . Taking a taxi directly to the Diamond Trading Company offices on Charterhouse Street gave him ample time to weigh and examine his stones between the 11 A.M. and 2 P.M. winter light , the only light by which one can even begin to judge the true color of even polished stones . When Silber was finished he paid for his diamonds with cashier 's checks he had brought with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stones into his battered briefcase . He reached London 's Heathrow Airport in plenty of time for BOAC Flight 507 to New York , arriving at Kennedy at 10:03 P.M. , the flight having been detained on the ground in London for minor mechanical reasons . Silber slept during most of the return flight , the briefcase clutched on his lap . Like most of those who made the trip to the Diamond Trading Company , Silber never told anyone when or where he was going . He had vaguely mentioned to his wife the day before that he would be in Boston and Hartford on business and that he might remain overnight . As far as Silber 's office was concerned , it remained closed for that day . Anyone who called would call again . Upon arriving at the British Airways building in Kennedy , Silber approached a customs officer and requested that he be examined separately and privately . In a small examining room he handed the inspector his small box of diamonds . The only other thing in the battered briefcase was a shaving kit . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examining the Diamond Trading Company 's bill of sale , the inspector stamped Silber 's passport and affixed the custom stamp to the briefcase . For further protection Silber was permitted to reenter the United States via a second door in the examining room that opened directly onto a corridor that led to an exit . Silber had left his station wagon in one of the short-term parking lots and by the time the airport bus had dropped him off at the entrance it was 11:45 P.M. Silber placed his briefcase on the passenger seat , fastened his safety belt , and the station wagon , a 1972 model Ford , started without any difficulty . Because there was little traffic at that hour of the night , he quickly cleared the airport maze . He traveled east on the side road that parallels the Southern Parkway and after a short distance , and two stop lights , he turned onto Rockaway Boulevard , which led directly into the town of Lawrence , where he lived . Considering that he had crossed and recrossed the Atlantic in a little more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a cold night , damp and overcast , a light spot in the sky showing where the moon was . At that hour Silber practically had Rockaway Boulevard to himself except that when he stopped for the red light at the junction of Rockaway and Farmers boulevards another car pulled up alongside his . Its driver honked his horn several times to catch Silber 's attention , leaned across the front seat , rolled down his window and seemed to be asking directions . Seemed because it was difficult for Silber to make out what he was saying . He mumbled , or he might have had a speech impediment , or he might have been a foreigner , it was impossible to tell . Silber cranked his window down all the way and stuck his head out , ear cocked , so that he might hear better . Nor was he able to see the man 's face for it was hidden by a road map , as if the man was trying to read something on it in the bad light . But Silber did manage to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , " he said , waving his left arm toward Farmers Boulevard . The light turned green . Just as Monroe Silber was about to step on the accelerator he felt a cold , hard , blunt something , obviously the muzzle of a gun , pressed into the back of his neck just above his collar . He stiffened and flushed and his heart seemed to stop for  | just a moment . He was aware of a hand reaching in through his window and unlocking the back door . Then the man who held the gun slipped into the seat directly behind him . Out of the corner of his eye Silber noticed that the driver that had asked directions was still alongside . A muffled voice , not unlike the one the driver had used , told him to remain facing forward and to turn up both of his rearview mirrors . Even though the voice was muffled Silber could recognize it as a New York voice , and he told himself that he would remember that fact when the police questioned him after it was all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assuring Silber , he would n't be hurt . He was told to continue driving straight ahead on Rockaway Boulevard . At the first sign of an oncoming car the voice behind him warned Silber against doing anything foolish . Only a few other cars passed them from either direction during the ride and none was a police car . After several minutes of silence Silber said , " Listen , I 've got a couple of hundred dollars in my pocket . Take it and I 'll forget the whole thing . I wo n't report it to the police , I swear . And I 'll drop you off where you want to go . All right ? " For an answer the gunman pressed his gun into Silber 's neck again . Where Rockaway Boulevard was joined by New York Boulevard Silber was told to make a left . After a short distance on New York Boulevard he was ordered to turn right onto one of the side streets , then turn again , left , another left , a right . . . until he had lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the station wagon along two ruts that led deeper and deeper into the tall dried grasses and cattails of a salt marsh . At no particular spot , it seemed , the voice behind him told him to stop and turn off his lights and ignition , which he did . " Listen , " Silber said , very frightened now . " I 've got something very important to tell you . Just do n't hurt me , please . I .... " It was at that moment that a wet towel was dropped over his head and pressed tightly and held against his nose and mouth . Silber knew that the towel was saturated with either chloroform or ether , but he could n't tell which . He struggled to break away , struggled to hold his breath as long as possible . But his efforts were  | pathetic and hampered by the seat belt . In a very short while he slumped down on the seat unconscious . It was close to five o'clock that same evening when Silber 's body was found . Two boys walking in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside and saw the man slumped in his seat , a towel over his face . They did n't touch him but ran to the house of the boy who lived the closest and told his mother . She telephoned the police . Monroe Silber was pronounced dead by the ambulance attendant and was listed as having arrived in that condition at the Jamaica Hospital . An autopsy performed a day later by the New York City Medical Examiner found that Silber had suffocated as a result of having inhaled a lethal amount of chloroform . Because more than two hundred dollars in cash was found in Monroe Silber 's pockets , it was first assumed that robbery had not been a motive in his death . However , the moment the homicide squad of the precinct in which Silber 's body had been found learned that he had been a diamond merchant , in accordance with department custom , a courtesy rather than an official procedure , a telephone call was immediately placed to Lieutenant James T. Dunn of the Manhattan Third Division . Lieutenant Dunn , in turn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passport showed that he had just returned from London , Addabbo called the Diamond Trading Company , and it was learned for the first time that $383,000 in uncut diamonds was missing from Silber 's battered briefcase . Lieutenant Dunn assumed charge of the Monroe Silber murder case . He watched while experts dusted the Ford station wagon for fingerprints . He personally questioned the two boys who had found the body , and Monroe Silber 's grieving widow , and his two best friends . He interviewed the customs officer who had dealt with Silber , and the flight attendants who had served on board BOAC flights 506 and 507 . And he placed a long-distance telephone call to the chief security officer of the Diamond Trading Company in London . Unfortunately , none of these efforts turned up a single clue . Everett Greenberg , thirty-eight years old , had fat fingers , which can be a handicap when handling diamonds , and bad teeth and  | worse skin . Everett was an equal partner with his cousin Irving in the firm , Emanuel Greenberg &; Sons , Inc. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had left the business to his two sons , their fathers , who had died within six months of each other three years before . In the 1960 's , because worldwide inflation had continually increased the value of such commodities as diamonds , and at the same time pushed up the already high cost of American labor , Emanuel Greenberg 's sons found that they could make as much money , if not more , by concentrating their energies on selling their allotment of rough from the Diamond Trading Company to other dealers and cutters who did not enjoy the privilege of being able to buy directly from the source . So they gave up the manufacturing part of the business . Everett and Irving Greenberg continued the business in the same manner . In addition , they also lent money , but only within the diamond community . Everett and Irving Greenberg also retained the same quarters their grandfather and fathers had used . Their office was a small clear-glass cubicle in the center of a long narrow loft on the seventh floor of 28 West Forty-seventh Street . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their grandfather 's time and the one window had been washed only semiannually during all those years . The sign on the outside steel door remained the same , which was why they were still thought of as manufacturers by those who did n't do business with them . There were eight workbenches in the loft , four on each side of the clear-glass cubicle , all fitted with the machinery and tools used in the cutting and polishing of diamonds , leftovers from Emanuel Greenberg 's day , though it should be pointed out that the basic design of such machinery has not changed since the sixteenth century . Sometimes these benches were rented out by the day , week or month to various cutters and polishers , free-lancers , or manufacturers with temporary increases in business . Their office cubicle contained a scarred steel desk , a swivel chair , two unmatching steel chairs and , most important , a large safe . It was a Mosler safe , an older one but made of specially hardened steel which was said to be invulnerable to ordinary safecracking tools . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night burglar alarm system that protected the entire premises . One of the important features of the safe was , in addition to the dial-controlled  | bolt , a key-operated lock . This permitted the cousins to open and close the safe door during the day in front of strangers without running the risk of exposing the dial combination . Since the week before Thanksgiving that year , Irving Greenberg had n't been feeling too good . He complained of a general run-down condition and especially of a pain in his back . For the past few weeks he had been taking Thursdays off to visit a chiropractor near his home in Sheepshead Bay and then spending the remainder of the day resting . So for the past three Thursdays Everett had been in the office all by himself . On Thursday , December 21 , as he did every morning at about ten-thirty , Everett Greenberg went to the bathroom . As always he first locked the safe door with a key , picked up his beloved New York Times , locked the three locks in the steel door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room to get in . Everett went through life carrying a heavy key ring . There were two stalls in the men 's room , one urinal and one washbasin . One of the stalls was occupied that morning , Everett could see a man 's legs under the partition , and he used the other one Rumanian agriculture in the Times . The first indication Everett Greenberg had that something might be wrong was when he went to wash his hands . The mirror over the washbasin had been covered with newspaper and masking tape . He had n't noticed it when he had first walked in , he had been looking at the legs under the partition . He was standing there wondering why the mirror was covered when he suddenly became aware of an acrid , almost searing smell . Before he could turn around someone threw a towel soaked with the stuff over his head and was pressing it tightly over his nose and mouth . The last thought Everett ever had was that it must be the man from the other stall . They found Everett @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another occupant of the seventh floor met the building 's superintendent in the lobby , he complained about the men 's room being out of order all day and wanted to know when it would be fixed . The superintendent said that , as far as he knew , there was nothing wrong with the men 's room on the seventh floor . Then why ,  | the complainant asked , was there an out-of-order sign on the door ? Everett 's arms had been trussed behind his back and his ankles tied , both with venetian blind cord , and his whole body had been further secured to the radiator . Adhesive tape had been pasted tightly over his mouth . The autopsy showed that when Everett had regained consciousness the inhalation of chloroform had caused him to vomit . But because of the adhesive tape over his mouth the vomitus could n't be expelled and he had choked on it . Like every other building superintendent on West Forty-seventh Street , the one who discovered Everett 's body received a twentydollar bill each Christmas from Sylvan Addabbo . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diamond community during the past year and reminded him once again that in case of any accident involving one of his diamond tenants , day or night , he was to kindly call Mr. Addabbo , who would immediately notify the appropriate police authorities . Addabbo 's office and home telephone numbers were on the card . Sylvan Addabbo immediately telephoned Lieutenant James Dunn of the Third Division , who , in turn , had the nearest patrol car immediately dispatched to West Forty-seventh Street . Addabbo , whose office was on the corner , arrived at about the same time as the police . They found the steel door to the Emanuel Greenberg &; Sons loft closed but not locked . Inside , the only sign that anything unusual might have taken place was the fact that Everett Greenberg 's key ring dangled from the daytime lock in the safe door . Lieutenant Dunn handled the press . All three New York City newspapers carried articles the following day about the murder . Quoting an unnamed police official at the site of the crime , the articles said that Greenberg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as of the moment , the police had no suspects . When asked by a reporter if there was any connection between this homicide and the death of Monroe Silber two days before , the police spokesman said that so far as was known there was none . Nothing was said about the fact that Everett Greenberg 's body had $84 on it when it was found and that $427,000 in uncut diamonds Everett had brought back from London the week before was missing . It was that evening that Sylvan Addabbo began trying to contact Charity Bay .  | " Cold , pussycat ? " the counterman called out the moment she had stepped into the fat-fried air and closed the door behind her . " How 's about a nice cup of coffee ? We call it holy water here . Before you even take your coat off . " " No , thank you , " she said , unbuttoning the thick coat as best she could with frozen fingers , then hanging it on a hook . She kept the scarf and beret on . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he asked , rubbing the area before her with a rag when she sat down . " I love coffee . That 's the problem . " She blew on her fingers and stared at the food list displayed over the counter . The counterman 's smile assumed a kinship with the rag in his hand and he glanced over to a regular who was seated on the last stool to see if he had heard . She was tired from not having slept and suffering from jet lag , which she knew from past experience would probably last at least one more day . And , unfortunately , she was hungry , very hungry . She ordered one poached egg on toasted English muffin , the egg to be dried on a paper towel before it was placed on the muffin , no potatoes , stewed prunes , and . . . . " If I may , I 'd like freshly boiled hot water for my tea . " " Fresh hot water , lady ? " " Yes , not out of the urn or that Silex thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  | " Oh , no charge , lady . We do it all the time . " And the counterman glanced at his regular again . The egg was tasteless , the English muffin soggy , the prunes too sweet and mushy and when the counterman poured the hot water from the pan he spilled some into the saucer , which made the tea bag run . It was n't that she had a sensitive or queasy stomach , the opposite was true . It was the injustice of the food system in the city that bothered her , the exorbitant prices for the at best mediocre food , sloppy , insulting service and , above all , the stinking atmosphere . " Everything all right , honey ? " the counterman asked when she paid her check . " No , " she answered . She did n't leave a tip . " If that was a man I 'd paste him right across his mouth , " the counterman said to his regular when she was gone . " You know what this country is coming to ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sixth Avenue and Fiftythird Street . Her first move in a case like this was to the telephone and when there were no conventions taking place on the Hilton mezzanine it was as private and as comfortable a place to make her calls from as anywhere in the city . The first was to a man named Mortimer Calvert , an insurance man with an office on Maiden Lane . " Mort , this is Charity Bay . " " Yes , Charity . " " Sylvan Addabbo . You know him ? " " Yes , know him very well . As a matter of fact he called me a week or so ago and wanted to know about you . " " Is he straight ? " " As much as anyone else not on welfare . " " What did you tell him about me ? " " I ca n't repeat it in mixed company . " The next call was to London . She used her telephone credit card and when she finally reached him spoke with a man named John Crosby . The exchange was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I help you , Miss Bay ? " Without mentioning diamonds she asked Crosby if any large amount of stolen property was suddenly being offered for sale on  | the underground market . Grosby knew of artworks only and when he finished reciting the list , which he seemed to have in front of him , she thanked him and asked if he would please notify her if anything new was brought to his attention He said he would and wished her a good day . In Paris she spoke with a Roger Ber . B6r also mentioned works of art in addition to several tons of Czech-made weapons and ammunition stored on barges in various channel ports . They had been destined for the IRA , but because of the effectiveness of the British blockade they were being offered for sale before they began to deteriorate . In Munich the contact 's name was Johann Voltmer ; in Geneva it was an Ernst Apfelschnitt ; in Rome a Dino Russi . All mentioned artworks , which seemed to be the most stolen commodity in Europe . There was also , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheat sitting on a siding somewhere in the Balkans that could be delivered to a buyer anywhere in Turkey . All of the contacts promised to notify her when , and if , any new , large or unusual lots of items were brought to their attention . After Europe , she telephoned people from Montreal to Tampa and as far west as Chicago , asking the same questions , receiving , more or less , the same answers . In the United States , in addition to artworks there were securities , bonds , cargoes of copper , fuel oil and gasoline . Everything , it seemed , but uncut diamonds . The last call Charity made was to the Bronx . The telephone rang a long time before it was picked up , she counted ten rings . A voice barely said , " ' lo ? " " May I speak to Mr. Gross , please ? " she asked . There was a pause before the voice said , " There ai n't no Mr. Gross here . " " Please tell Mr. Gross that Charity Bay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There was another pause and then a gravelly , unmistakably angry voice came on the line . " Hello ? Hello ? This is Gross . " " Louis . " She pronounced the " s . " " This is Charity Bay . I 'd like to hire your brain for about an hour this afternoon . I 've got a few questions I 'd like to ask . Same place as always . Let 's see , make it  | two o'clock ? Is that all right with you ? Does that give you enough time ? " " No , it 's not all right , " Gross yelled back at her . " I told you before in a nice way . I do n't like you calling me like this , telling me I got to meet you because you got some questions you want to ask . You 're a pain , you know that ? I keep telling you I just ca n't drop my business every time you got a goddamn question you want to ask me and rush into New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down hard . It was a quarter to one then . She made several more calls , then took a taxi to the corner of Lexington Avenue and Twenty-seventh Street and walked the rest of the way . Between Lexington and Third she stopped in front of a bookstore whose sign said , simply , TECHNICAL BooKS , and glanced inside before she entered it . When she opened the door a small bell tinkled , and the woman at the cash register looked up and then turned back to the book she had been reading . The store was otherwise empty . She browsed her way to the rear and when she arrived at a door that said PIUVAZENo ADMITTANCE she entered it . The area behind the store was mostly occupied by cartons of various sizes . When she flipped a switch on the wall an open trap door near the rear wall lighted up to show wooden steps leading down to the cellar . The steps squeaked and resounded as she descended . She stopped on the last one to peer into the semidarkness . The cellar was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , and a pile of empty soda bottles . In one corner of the cellar a room had been built of used plywood . She flipped a naked switch to the right of the battered panel door of the room and two decrepit lamps inside came on , one leaning at an angle , the other without a shade . The light disclosed a pinup calendar for 1965 from the Bergen Gasket Company , an old round green wicker table , one ice-cream parlor chair , and a stained overstuffed couch whose overstuffing was pushing itself through tears and worn spots in the upholstery . Behind the door was a coat rack holding one limp black raincoat . She used it to wipe the seat of the ice-cream parlor chair . Louis Gross arrived a few minutes later . She heard him charging down the wooden steps and remained seated until he came into the  | little room . He was aptly named . His thick heavy head with its wet sausagelike lips sat on a thick neck , which in turn jutted up out of a thick body . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen him , to long , and she decided it made him look like the witch who had tried to burn poor Hansel and Gretel . In between two of his short hairy fingers he carried the wet stub of a cigar . " Thanks a lot for coming , Louis , " she said pleasantly , getting up and closing the door behind him . His face reddened when he saw her and his bulging eyelids squinted at her . He started to put the cigar into his mouth but changed his mind when it was halfway there and threw it with all his might onto the floor . " Listen , you . . " he said , advancing on her , spitting out a shred of tobacco ahead of him . " The only reason I showed up was to tell you I 'm sick and tired of you , understand ? You got something on me . All right . I want to buy , and this time you 're going to sell . Understand ? " And he raised a finger to point at her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my life jumping every time you pick up the telephone . Understand ? I got a living to make . I got a family to support . But most of all because I do n't like for no broad to say , Louie , jump ! ' and expect me to jump . Understand ? " He swung at her then , suddenly , but he was clumsy and his movements predictable , and she was easily able to lean out of his reach . He said , " Son of a bitch , " and raised his hand to swing again , but before he could she kicked him in the crotch with all the force of her weight , her body actually leaving the floor at the exact moment of impact . A look of disbelief , then of pain , came over Gross ' face , his huge bulging eyes became wet with tears and he said , " Ugh , " and repeated it less loudly a second time . Then he bent over as far as his thick body would permit , his heavy shaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a moment , then sat on the ice-cream parlor chair . Still doubled up , and gasping for breath , still cradling his testicles , Gross stumbled to the couch and lowered his body gently , testily , before finding comfort on one of his huge cheeks . " What kind of stuff is this ? " he asked plaintively , barely looking up at her .  | " I call it the great equalizer , " she said , crossing her legs . " I do n't understand you , Louis . Really , I do n't . It 's true that I 've got enough on you to send you up for a very long time . But it is n't that I do n't pay you for your time . I do n't like you any more than you like me , but unfortunately you happen to know a lot and I need you . We ca n't discuss these things on the telephone so we have to meet here . If there was anyone else I assure you I would n't hesitate using him . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much time to waste . The reason I asked you here today is that I 'm interested in certain , specific merchandise . What 's being offered for sale , say within the past month ? " He shifted his huge body to the other cheek . He took a handkerchief from his breast pocket , wiped the tears from his eyes and cheeks and then wiped his mouth . " Well , " he began slowly , almost timidly , first hunching his shoulders . " The usual stuff . Let me see ... ugh , I hear about television sets , color . . . ugh , whiskey , you name your brand and tax stamps , you want Connecticut I can get you Connecticut , you want Jersey , I can get you Jersey . Furs , I hear about furs , skins , mostly mink . . . ugh . . . I hear about meat , carcasses , kosher , trafe , anything . I hear about pictures , lots of pictures and statues , Picasso . . . ugh , what 's his name ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular picture , just tell me where it 's at and I can get it for you . I hear about a lot of antiques , lots of silver , some people I hear about are melting it down , brings a good price and no problems . Guns ? I hear about guns , lots of guns , any kind , but mostly in big quantities . Pills ? Dope ? Anything like that , you just name it and you got it . Ugh , why do n't you tell me what you 're interested in , help me out a little ? " Somewhere along the way Louis Gross seemed to have returned to normal . " And that 's all that is being offered right now ? " " That 's what I hear , " he answered , shifting buttocks again , moving more easily now . " Thank you , Louis , " she said getting up , opening her purse and taking out five twenty-dollar bills which she handed him . He got off the couch carefully , took the money and put it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly , taking smaller steps than he was accustomed to , he walked out of the little room with as much  | dignity as he could muster , and she heard him slowly climb the wooden staircase . When he was gone she picked his cigar butt up off the floor and dropped it in a gallon olive oil tin that was being used as a wastebasket . She waited for several minutes before she closed the door to the little room , turned out the lights and left the bookstore . She called her answering service from the first available telephone booth which was in the entrance of a cafeteria on the corner of Third Avenue . Phil was very excited . He said that Mr. Addabbo 's office had called . It was urgent . She was to get in touch with him as soon as she could . The woman who answered Addabbo 's telephone said her name was Miss Priest . She was equally excited . " Miss Bay ? Miss Charity Bay ? Oh , I 'm so glad you called . Someone else has just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West Forty-seventh Street . Fifth floor . If you called anytime this afternoon Mr. Addabbo said for you to meet him there . If you have any trouble with the police . . . I mean getting in ... you 're to ask for Lieutenant Dunn . Lieutenant James Dunn . " By the time she had finished giving the message Miss Priest sounded as if she were going to cry .  | Andries Katze had had a one o'clock appointment with Simon Sandler , but there was no answer when he pressed the buzzer alongside the door of Sandler 's one-room office . Nor did anything happen when he knocked as hard as he could on the steel panel , or when he tried to shout , " Simon ! " through it several times . Katze , a native of South Africa and now a diamond buyer for a chain of jewelry stores in Texas and Oklahoma , had been dealing with Simon Sandler for more than fourteen years , and in all that time the old man had never once been late or missed an appointment . Andries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the lobby of the building , but still there was no answer . Right then and there he knew that something was wrong , knew it deep in the folds of his bowels . He had been involved with diamonds since he was nineteen years old , and his natural human suspicion and paranoia had been honed razor sharp . Katze immediately dialed 911 , the police emergency number in New York . Of the three locks on Simon Sandler 's door only the spring latch was in place and the police sergeant used his plastic credit card to release it . They found Sandler 's body crumpled up against his desk . His yarmulke , the skullcap religious Jews wear night and day as a constant reminder of the greater being above them , was , surprisingly , still on his head , though slightly askew . The bullet had entered just above the left eye and had traveled slightly upward . The sergeant guessed that the yarmulke had been knocked off when Sandler had been shot and whoever had killed him had put it back . Sandler had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he was not  | only licensed to carry but a framed testament from the National Rifle Association on the wall certified to the fact that he had qualified as an expert marksman with it . The Colt had not been fired . The safe door was closed but not locked and there was no way at that time for the police to know that on Friday before Christmas a messenger from the Diamond Trading Company had delivered a sealed parcel containing $279,000 worth of rough , Simon Sandler having long since given up traveling to London to buy diamonds . Andries Katze , shaking , sick to his stomach , tears in his eyes , was asked to wait until Lieutenant Dunn arrived . Unable to find a chair and confused by the waves of police who flooded in every time the elevator stopped , he slid down along the wall and sat on the floor with his head in his hands . Dunn arrived in about twenty minutes . He was introduced to Katze almost immediately , but he politely asked the diamond buyer to wait just a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it that the investigative machinery got started properly . This took another ten minutes . Dunn was exceedingly polite , surprisingly so , Katze thought , considering all the stories he had read about the New York City Police Department . He examined Katze 's driver 's license thoroughly , and business card , which he put in his pocket . When he was ready to ask questions he called over an aide , a sergeant , who took out a spiral notebook and prepared to take notes . Dunn asked Katze to please repeat everything that had happened , in sequence , and asked him several times why he had immediately thought to telephone the police , ordinarily a person would just leave and try to contact Sandler later in the afternoon . Katze was unable to explain why he had done what he did . For one thing he was ashamed to say that when he visited New York he always expected the worst to happen . Still soft-spoken , still polite , Lieutenant Dunn asked Katze how long he expected to remain in New York . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I have n't accomplished onetenth of my business yet . " And where he was staying , the Americana Hotel , all of which the sergeant wrote in his notebook . After Katze had given his home address in Houston , Dunn finally said that he could leave .  | Katze had every intention of remaining in New York for two more days . In addition to his business he should have stayed to attend Simon Sandler 's funeral . But by the time he reached his hotel room his hands were shaking so badly and his stomach and head , and what he thought might be his heart were all acting so strangely that he immediately telephoned American Airlines and booked a seat on the next flight to Dallas , which left at seven that evening , hoping that by doing so he was not breaking any law , that he was not suddenly becoming a fugitive from justice . Policemen and women were asking for identification and recording the names of people entering or leaving 55 West Forty-seventh Street when she arrived . As Addabbo had foreseen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the elevator on the fifth floor by a young patrolman with a modified Afro haircut . She gave him her name and asked for Lieutenant Dunn . The patrolman made a call through a portable emergency telephone system that had been set up to connect various parts of the building , speaking in low tones and examining her from head to foot while seeming not to be doing it . When he received the permission he asked her to please accompany him and took her as far as another police barrier at the entrance to the corridor that led to Sandler 's office . He asked her to remain behind the barrier while he notified Lieutenant Dunn . He returned with the lieutenant several minutes later . Dunn was in plainclothes , a gold and blue lieutenant 's shield pinned to the breast pocket of his beautifully tailored , sand-colored whipcord suit . She guessed that he was about thirty-five and noticed that his cuff links were miniature lieutenant 's shields , and that there was also a tiny lieutenant 's shield on his tie clasp . He stuck out his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the smile . " I 'm Jimmy Dunn , " he said pleasantly . " Sylvan said you might be here . You just missed him . " He had a cleft in his chin which reminded her of miniature buttocks . She guessed that she would n't have thought about it that way if it had n't been for the cuff links . His eyes were green , the kind of green she would have liked to have , and the way his hair was groomed , the perfect combination his brown knit tie made with  | the brown bold-striped shirt , and his highly polished shoes made her also guess that he had always been a pretty boy . " May I please see your investigator 's license ? " he asked unexpectedly , though politely . As far as she could tell there was no T and A syndrome at work here . She took the photostat of the license out of her purse and handed it to him . Unlike most other people , he took his time and carefully read both sides of it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it back and they had begun to walk down the corridor , " that the people who did this somehow got into his office just after Sandler opened the safe for the day . We also feel that they did n't plan to kill him but he must have grabbed his gun from somewhere on his desk and whoever shot him did it in self-defense . Sylvan told you about the others , did n't he ? Well , the crazy thing about all of them is that these people do n't seem to be killers but they always make a mistake and their victims , unfortunately , always end up dead . We are asking people in the building if they heard the shot but so far no one has . We are also not yet certain what was taken from the safe , if anything . We 'll know more as soon as we call London . " Before she stepped inside the office Dunn warned her against touching anything , as if she did n't know and could n't read the signs . There was not much to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dark stain in front of the desk . The office was brightly lit by photographers ' lights . The photographers , fingerprint experts and lab people all looked up at her when she walked in , mostly at the T and A , and then went back to work . There was a red chalk circle around the hole the slug had gouged out of the wall . She remained inside the office for only a few minutes . When she stepped out Dunn was talking with one of several knots of men in uniform and plainclothes . There were a lot of raincoats and skinnybrimmed hats , and she noticed that in addition to New York Police Department shields there were some FBI and Treasury Department badges too . It really seemed like a small police convention . From the bits and pieces of conversation she was able to hear they were n't talking about the murder but about who had had a heart attack , and who had gotten a promotion , or a divorce , or was bankrupt , or in the hospital with kidney disease . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her but not long enough to miss what was being said within the group . When Dunn saw her standing there he excused himself and came over . " Thanks , " she said , this time extending her hand first . " I guess if you 've seen one crime site you 've seen them all . " He nodded . " People think there 's a lot of excitement and glamour in all of this , but it 's pretty routine , and boring . " They walked slowly toward the elevator . " If there 's anything I can do to help you out , please do n't hesitate to ask , " he said to her wonderment . Cops usually resented outsiders , most especially lady outsiders . " And I 'd like to feel that the reverse is true , too . You can do things that we ca n't . Do you know what I mean ? And just to make certain that there is no wasted effort we should keep in touch . " Wonderment was too weak a word . " I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was walking her all the way back to the elevator . " By the way , whatever his reasons for hiring you one of them has got to be that he wants something extra , you get what I mean ? Sylvan thinks of himself as irresistible to women . I do n't have to say anything else , do I ? " He smiled and she returned the smile . " Do you eat dinner ? " he asked with his very next breath . They were now only several feet from the elevator and the patrolman with the modified Afro was looking at them without seeming to . " How about tonight ? " Now that it was out she realized she felt more at ease . " Pm sorry , " she said , trying to look genuinely sorry . " I 'm busy tonight . " He seemed both surprised and disappointed . Obviously not many people turned down his dinner invitations . " Then we 'll have to make it real soon . " " Yes , " she said . The patrolman had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they reached it .  | The first available telephone was in the lobby of a shabby building several doors from Sandler 's office . The booth , an old one , stood alone at the nub of a dead end off the lobby and when she closed the folding door it was as if time had been rolled back thirty years . There was that much accumulation of cigarette and cigar smoke on the goose-bump tin walls . She gave the operator a Denver number and her credit card identification , and the telephone on the other end was eventually picked up by her contact , a man named Timme who spoke in a carefully controlled voice as if afraid what he would be saying might melt the wires . All of the calls she made from that booth were west of Chicago because of the time difference . All were in vain . She quit at around six o'clock , guiltily , because she was tired , and very hungry , and still somewhat disoriented because of the jet lag . Mr. Horvath was on duty at the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door for her , but without a smile , and he did n't so much as move a pore when some letters spilled out of her mailbox and onto the floor . In her apartment she dumped the mail on the desk , threw her outer clothes onto an armchair , kicked her shoes off and all but collapsed on the couch . She was asleep almost immediately . Hunger pangs awakened her half an hour later . She got up , washed her face in cold water and ate one quick chocolate cookie to tide her over . She changed into a pair of warm subtle-plaid slacks and a white wool sweater with a loose-fitting turtleneck , which was the only kind of turtleneck she could stand . She was all  | the way out to the elevator when she decided that she had to have one more cookie or she would die . It was a clear cold night and the streetlamps and car headlights sparkled like diamonds , of all things . As she walked she blew breath up toward the tip of her nose to warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as she could remember . Restaurants and cancer fought each other for position on her personal list of things and she set about finding a place to eat with that attitude . She had never gotten used to the New York mania for eating in the pretentious , overpriced , lousy stomach disasters that dotted every block of the city . It always amazed her that when she met anyone , socially or otherwise , they usually ended up talking about restaurants . They spoke with passion and quoted the Times ' and other food critics , about this restaurant and that , about French cooking , Chinese cooking , rattling off dishes like mothers naming their children . It never ceased to amaze her , especially when she ate in the restaurants they suggested . It was n't that she was lacking in taste for food . She did have a favorite food , pasta . As a matter of fact she had an obsession about pasta . On several insane occasions she had eaten it three times in one day . She adored pasta in any form , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leftovers from the night before for breakfast , with ketchup when there was n't time to make it any other way and , God in heaven above , even pasta out of a can . She hesitated at the entrance of a Chinese restaurant she had once eaten in , decided against it , did the same before a German restaurant and finally , practically limp from hunger , she entered a place on Eighty-seventh Street named Sidonie 's , which she had n't seen before and might have been new to the neighborhood . She handed her coat to a dim shadow in the cloakroom and received a check in return . The hostess , a gaunt woman with rouged cheekbones , smiled and asked if she wished to wait for her man in the bar or at a table . She said that she was alone and the gaunt woman smiled an understanding . Even though there were few other diners in Sidonie 's that evening the hostess led her to the penalty table hard up against a radiator and barely large enough for the place setting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming out of the kitchen  | every time the doors were opened . Finally , begrudgingly , she was allowed to sit at a decent-size table in the middle of the room . When the waiter came up he asked if she would care for a drink while waiting for monsieur and she said that there was n't any monsieur . The filet mignon was listed at an outrageous fifteen dollars and her first inclination was to get up and walk out , but she knew she would feel the same about any other place , so she ordered it , a point , did the waiter know what a point meant ? More than rare and yet not quite medium . " Of course , " he answered , surprised , as if it were the most evident thing in the world , and then smiled reassuringly , that she was in good hands , that she must trust him . She munched two breadsticks smeared with butter until the tiny circle of beef arrived with a mushroom button on top plus a baked potato and a small separate dish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flourish and even said , " Bon appetit , madame , " now that they had established they had French in common . The center of the steak was not only raw , but ice cold . The waiter responded after a short while to her discreetly raised finger and seemed aghast when she explained calmly that this was raw , that raw was not a point . A point was more than rare and not quite medium . He agreed with her , apologized profusely , bowed , and took the dish away , leaving the string beans . When he brought the steak back it had been cooked to the consistency of balsa wood . She was neither offended nor surprised . As a matter of fact she had more or less expected it . Without another word she got up , ignored the waiter who was watching her , and walked out of the room . Behind her she sensed a sort of fuss , the scraping of several chairs , someone tapping a fork or a knife against a water glass . She received her coat from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the dining room does n't rate a goddamn tip in the cloak room . She was half inside the coat when a sort of tension filled the small entrance area , as if air had been suddenly withdrawn from it . A short fat man with blue jowls and wearing a loud vest was holding out his chubby hands toward her and trying to make his fat  | face smile pleasantly . Behind him , in the doorway , the waiter stood and watched . " Miss , oh , miss , " the fat man said . " Miss . I am the manager , would you please tell me what the trouble is , perhaps I can straighten the whole thing out . " " The steak was n't the way I had ordered it , " she answered , slipping the rest of the way into her coat . " Ha , ha , " he said . " But , madame , we ca n't run a business this way . What are we to do with the steak ? You ordered it , then send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid I 'll have to insist that you pay for it . " " You 'll have to take me to the Supreme Court for that , " she answered , facing him squarely , looking directly down into his fat eyes . The smile left the blue-jowled face . The commotion had already drawn the attention of several other diners and one or two citizens from the bar . The loud vest began to heave perceptibly and his ears reddened . But instead of attacking her , he turned savagely to the gaunt hostess who protected herself by pressing the collection of menus up against her pathetic chest . " Starting from now there 's a new house rule , " he bellowed at her . " From this moment on no more unescorted broads in the dining room . You got that ? See me first . Next time garbage like this comes in see me before you seat her . You got that clear ? " " Yes , Mr. Harold , " the hostess was saying when she walked out . She dined that night in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called veal Palestrina , of which she had one ghastly bite , and a large , large plate of spaghetti marinara , which she devoured to the last speck of red . It was after ten when she started home . She was full inside and that felt good . But she was still tired and uncertain about plans for the following day . There were fewer pedestrians on the way back . Eighty-third Street was deserted when she turned the corner , or at least it was until she had walked about one hundred feet down the block . Then two men who seemed to have been in quiet conversation between parked cars stepped onto the curb and as she passed they grabbed her . Completely surprised , she tried twisting out of their fingers before they could get a good grip on her , noticing that both of them  | had nylon stockings pulled down over their faces , one beige , the other one black , the black one with a large ladder run in it , for God 's sake , making part of a cheek and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and someone grunted and said , " Owl " then , " For Chrissakes grab her legs , you schmuck ! " A set of fingers found their way around her throat and she tried to grab them and force them back toward their wrist . But just then her legs were pulled out from under and she fell on the curb and was half dragged , half carried through the narrow space between two parked cars . She reached out and managed to grab the bumper of one of the cars and tried twisting free , but whoever was holding her head dropped it and kicked her arms until she let go . From that point she was dragged feet first , head scraping the ground , toward the rear of a small panel truck that was double-parked . Someone inside the truck pushed the rear doors open and both men began lifting her up . But just then something barked and growled and seemed to climb the back of the one who held her legs . " Jesus , " he cried out . " Let 's get out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too complicated to register exactly what happened after that , but her neck was also released and she fell , face first , into something slimy and sour . Instinctively she rolled away from the truck , trying to see while trying to escape , rolling through more of the sour , slimy mess which dotted the street so that it was now in her hair and all over her hands and coat and white sweater . The truck 's motor revved to a scream , tires screeched , a hot blast of exhaust hit her in the face and it lurched forward . She was n't able to see the license plate or any name on the truck , but before the rear doors were pulled together from inside she was able to make out Louis Gross ' thick , ugly profile , cigar and all . There was no mistake about it . The dog 's name was Andrew . He was a German shepherd and his owner 's name was either Mr. McArdle or Mr. Max Ardull . He was a slight man , hatless even in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrapped several times around his neck like a python and bedroom slippers . He grabbed and secured Andrew before the dog could attack her , too , and held him on a short leash . He excused himself for not being able to help her to her feet but Andrew was strong , did she want him to call the police for her ?  | She rose slowly , using the car she was lying against as an aid . She thanked Mr. McArdle and Andrew for coming to her rescue , said that she did n't want him to call the police and that she lived not too far away . She was shaky and walked with difficulty . Andrew and his master accompanied her as far as her building . Mr. Horvath 's nose wrinkled like the bellows on a camera when she all but fell into the lobby . " Miss Bay ! Wha . . . What happened to you ? What 's that on your face , and in your hair ? Oh , my God , it 's .... " " Doggie-doo , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the open elevator where she vomited up all of that lovely spaghetti .  | She awakened stiff and sore with a pounding head and a bruised throat inside and out that made swallowing a chore and downing two aspirins a torture . She examined herself carefully in the fulllength mirror inside the closet door , first her face which , fortunately , had hardly puffed at all , then her body , the bruises she had inventoried the night before and new ones on her shoulders , arms and below her appendectomy scar that she was seeing for the first time . She was hungry but all she was able to swallow were four cups of hot tea . She found that she had difficulty speaking , too , first to the cabdriver and then to the clerk in charge of the safe-deposit vault at The Bank of New York . In a tiny room she spent close to fifteen minutes going through the collection of incriminating photographs she had of Louis Gross . They had been taken by a Roman magazine photographer in Sicily and it was only by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They showed Gross and another man in a variety of situations and she finally chose four , the two of them playing cards on the terrace of a villa , walking together and engaged in deep conversation on a lonely country road , eating dinner , and on a beach surrounded by several buxomy young girls . The man with Gross was a deported Mafia figure whom Gross had sworn before a federal grand jury that he had never known , or ever knowingly spoken to . She put these four photographs into a manila envelope and returned her box to its place in the vault . She used a telephone on the corner to place a call and when the operator at the U.S. Attorney 's  | office came on she asked to speak to a Leslie Heyman , her voice box aching with each syllable , repeating the name twice to make certain the operator understood . Leslie Heyman said that Charity 's call was a delightful surprise , and she asked about her health and mentioned that it had been more than a year since they had last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leslie gasped . " Charity , love , we 've been trying to get something on this miserable worm for years . How did you get these ? Of course , we 're eternally grateful . " She explained that Leslie , and only Leslie , was to pick up the envelope from her lawyer 's office , and she gave his address . Leslie was to identify herself by giving her ex-husband 's middle name . Leslie giggled and said she was surprised that Charity knew it , had she told it to her ? Leslie then asked why she was n't afraid that Gross would have her killed . " He could , you know . We 're sure he 's had it done before . " She then explained that she had other even more incriminating evidence which her lawyer would make public if anything violent ever happened to her , evidence that would put Gross away for life . " I 'm impressed , Charity , " Leslie Heyman said . " But then you have never failed to impress me . Even though you are probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withholding of evidence and protecting criminals . " She then thanked her again for the photographs , wished her a Happy New Year , said that they must get together very , very soon ? " The next party I have " ? and hung up . After leaving the manila envelope with her lawyer whose office was only a block away , she stopped at a cafeteria where , with a great deal of effort , she was able to swallow near-rancid orange juice , tasteless soft-boiled eggs and two cups of tepid , flavorless tea . It was snowing when she stepped out onto the street again but the flakes were melting as soon as they hit a surface . The cabbie who drove her downtown smoked a pipe and complained about the weather , business , the lack of true holiday spirit and the city administration . She got out of the cab at Sixth and Greenwich avenues and walked the one block to Waverly Place . Number 143 , like most of the other buildings on the street was a four-story building with a high stone stoop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brownstone , but 143 had once been painted gray and now some of the paint was coming off in gigantic flakes . She walked past the high stoop twice without going up . She would have watched it from the street , but the snow had turned into a light steady rain and she walked into a hairdressing salon on the other side of the street and about fifty feet toward the corner from which the gray building could be seen . A young Puerto Rican girl came out of the back in answer to the buzz set off by the opening of the door to ask if she had an appointment . She simply asked if she might wait inside for a friend . The girl looked suspiciously at her but only for an instant , then said sweetly , of course . But she turned the keys in a desk drawer and put them into the pocket of her black nylon smock before she disappeared into the back again . She pulled a chrome and leather chair closer to the window , took off her coat , which caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she was moving like an old lady , and sat down . She was able to think of a lot of things in the hour she waited but , unfortunately , nothing productive . Each time she thought about Louis Gross the blood seethed to her head and she gritted her teeth or wanted to . In that hour only three people came out of 143 . Number three was the one she had been waiting for . First the curtain on the door stirred and was barely pushed aside . Then the door opened slowly , and finally a man in a Vandyke beard , wearing a black beret and belted raincoat , and carrying a cane , came out , paused on the top step , looked to the left and right then rapidly descended into the street . She put her coat on and left the shop , averting her head slightly as she did so , and timed her arrival on the other side of the street so that she and the man met as she stepped onto the curb . When he was close enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The man jumped , literally jumped as if he had been goosed , and at the same time pulled the handle off his cane to reveal that it was a small pistol . It was only after he had pointed it in the general direction of her belly that he recognized her . " Miss Bay ! My God , Miss Bay ! You gave me such a fright I almost had a heart attack . And I almost shot you . How on earth did you ever find me ? No one knows where I am . " He spoke with both a slight lisp and some sort of a middle European accent . Up close  | his face above the beard was etched with enough anxious lines to make it seem like corduroy . But his eyes were brilliantly alive , black and sparkling they looked up and down the street as if they were able to see through buildings and parked cars . His Adam 's apple seemed to have a life of its own . It bobbed on a fixed course under the loose skin of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her arm and returning the pistol to its place in the cane . " We ca n't stand here . " He led her back to the building and , by the elbow , quickly up the steep stone steps . Once inside he did exactly as he had done before emerging , examined the street carefully from behind the curtains and only when he was satisfied did he unlock the inside door . His apartment was up four flights of stairs and to the rear . It took four different keys to open his door and as soon as they were inside he locked all four of them again . Without taking off the beret , or opening his coat , Harry Diamond slumped into an armchair , laid his head back and began gasping dramatically for air . " You know , Miss Bay , " he said after a moment , turning his eyes but not his head toward her . " You gave me quite a fright . Have you heard that they want to kill me ? " " I did n't know exactly , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , walking to the opposite side of the long but narrow room , taking off her coat and folding it on top of a glass coffee table . " Do you know why ? Why they want to kill me ? " " No , " she said . " They want to kill me because they say I cheated them and then informed on them . " He said it petulantly as if the accusation alone was enough to kill him . He rolled his head to each side , but only once , and his eyes now glistened with tears . " The whole thing is absurd . You know it 's absurd , do n't you , Miss Bay ? You know that it simply is n't true . " She had chosen a rocking chair to sit on and she rocked it slightly without answering , because she did n't know . " It 's not true . I 've made fortunes for them , for all of us , millions , literally millions . . . that is , in francs . Why should I suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And inform on them now ? I ask you ? "  | He waited for an answer , looking first at the ceiling and then at her to see if one was forthcoming . " Miss Bay , I did all of the planning , I always did the planning . I knew which gems were worth taking , and where they were . I alone knew , perhaps of all the people on the entire continent , I alone knew . Then , I trained those who went to get them . By the time this , this . . . misery happened I must have trained and educated an entire generation of . . . of takers . Thieves , if you will . But I also brought sanity to that world . No killing . No beating . I insisted on that . No one was ever killed during any of my operations except for this last time . Millions of francs worth of gems , some of the most famous jewelry in the world has passed through these hands " He said this proudly and held up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the stuff came to me first and I examined everything carefully . " His voice suddenly became reverent . He pointed vaguely toward a refectory table at the end of the room on which were a balance under a clear plastic cover and an elaboratelooking microscope , also under plastic , which she guessed was used for examining precious stones . " I took ignoramuses , hoodlums , from all over Europe and I trained them . I rejected the out and out scum , the hot heads , the congenital murderers , the grotesques , all alcoholics and addicts and chose only those I felt were willing to learn , men and women , too , those who would listen to what I had to say , people who wanted to better themselves , who would work the way I wanted them to work . And I changed their lives , literally changed their lives for them . I picked out their clothes , told them what to eat , yes , even what to eat . I taught them to speak correctly , their own languages as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italian , all the languages I know . I taught them table manners in most cases , and the value of money , taught them how to handle the large sums they would soon have without attracting attention . It is there that most thieves are caught . A man who should n't have money suddenly has a great deal of it to spend . " He coughed and seemed to realize for the first time that he was warm . He clutched for and tore off his scarf , beret and gloves , and threw them onto the floor . He unbuttoned and unbelted his raincoat but kept it on , only opening it wide . " And then , after all of  | this , all of these years . . . Have you heard what happened , Miss Bay ! " She shook her head . " Two of my boys were found dead immediately after the last project I was involved in , and the jewels they had taken were missing , are still missing as far as I know . " There were tears in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough the Paris police raided the apartment of the man who controlled , probably still controls it all . He was taken in for questioning , something previously unheard of . But , of course , because of his connections no charges were brought . I do n't know where he is now , except that his people are looking for me . " The very next day they tried to kill me twice , twice in one day . The first time they tried to run me down as I crossed a street . And then by putting plastique in my telephone . When the poor , dear Dolores , my maid . . . when she lifted the receiver to make a call . . . . Oh my God , my God . " But I got away , the good Lord only knows how . Fortunately ? even though I had thought it would never happen  --  I had prepared for just such an eventuality . I had hidden a few resources here , a few there , all over the world , which is the beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then to Brazil , then to Istanbul , and now here . This is as good a place as any . And I grew this . " He pointed to his beard and mustache . " I am disguised as a painter . " I know how thoroughly they look for people . " And he shook his head sadly . " I have seen them do it . I have even , God . . . I have even helped them , participated in their searches , given ideas where to look . They will track someone down anywhere on earth , it is almost a matter of pride with them and , of course , it serves as a lesson for others . They have infinite resources . No place is safe , monasteries , farms , jungles , obscure isolated islands , even , probably , heaven and hell . And I have seen what they sometimes do to the poor unfortunates . . . us poor unfortunates , when they find them and I have heard stories . Oh , God , what have I done to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that I always made it a special point to help orphans ? Wherever I have been , wherever I have traveled I always sought out orphans to help . Except here in  | New York . I am too afraid . But how did you find me ? Did anyone mention that I was here ? " " Purely by accident , " she said . " I was having dinner in a restaurant down here a few months ago when you walked past the window . At first I was n't sure it was you . I did n't remember your having a beard and mustache , and , of course , your clothes were different and you had lost a great deal of weight . But your walk is unique . I recognized your walk , and I was certain it was you . So I got up from the table and followed you here . The man I was having dinner with has not spoken to me since . I did n't need you then , and I guessed that you were in hiding for some reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you now . I 'd like to ask you some questions . " Harry Diamond had covered his mouth with his hand . " The way I walk ! Oh , my God . I was certain I had thought of everything . I even lost all that weight , you must remember the way I used to like to eat . But I almost starved myself . I will change it . Immediately . I will find a new way to walk , and I will practice until it is perfect . Thank you , Miss Bay . Thank you . Imagine ! My walk ! And I will remember not to pass in front of restaurant windows . That 's important , too . " He seemed so preoccupied that she got up to look at the bookcase behind her . " That 's all that is left of one of the greatest collections of diamond literature in the world , " he said when he noticed her . " That is all that I was able to get out of my apartment , out of Paris , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There , right where you are standing , on that second shelf , from left to right , a copy of Arthasastra by Kautilya , maybe written in the third century before Christ , the earliest reference to diamonds . Then are the Ratnapariksa by Buddhabhatta , the Brahatsamhita recorded by Varahamihira , and the Agastimata . They are all Indian , those you see are the German translations . They range from the fifth through the sixteenth centuries A.D. They not only record prices , but they include discourses on the quality of diamonds , on the mystical properties the Indians ascribed to them and the various mythologies that grew up around them . Very interesting , I have  | read them a thousand times and I continue to read them over and over again . " On the shelf above that , the ones in the leather bindings are copies of Pliny 's Naturalis Historia , in Latin , and The Book of Nature by Konrad von Megegberg , which was written about 1350 . They also speak of diamonds . After those are the complete writings of Jean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perhaps the most famous diamond merchant who has ever lived . When he was twenty-one he made his first trip to India to buy diamonds and he continued to visit it for the rest of his life . He put down everything he saw . Some of the mines he visited were being worked by hundreds of thousands of men , women and children . Fascinating , I never tire of him . The other books you see are textbooks on mining , engineering , various technologies and on diamond economics . There are privately printed monographs on geology , on various cutting techniques . No two generations cut diamonds the same way . No two countries cut their diamonds in exactly the same way . It is possible , I can do it with ease , to distinguish the work of various individual cutters , and at different points in their careers . Some of the papers there contain estimates , most of them confidential , on the number of diamonds there might be in the world and on how many remain to be mined . It is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural diamonds will be worth ten , twenty , one hundred times what they are worth today . That shelf there , the one that is so tightly packed , that contains catalogues of public auctions of diamonds in Paris , London , and New York , with prices . They date back to 1926 . But it is not complete . As I said , this is only a minute portion of what my library once was . " Also in that bookcase is some of my own work . A sort of genealogy of diamonds . I have kept track as they moved from hand to hand so that I could know where they were at all times . That is why I am , or was , so very valuable . I knew where everything was . I also knew the habits of the various collectors . When something disappeared from public view I could guess within a few people who might own it . " I 'm not boasting , Miss Bay , when I tell you I know as much about diamonds as any man on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | polished , and tell you within three dollars , three dollars mind you , as to what it is worth . And be right all of the time . I could have made a good living just going to diamond clubs and bourses in all of the major cities , getting stones on consignment and then selling them . Of course , I am not permitted in , or anywhere near , any of the diamond bourses or clubs . My pictures , unfortunately ... . " Ah , there , see that picture on the wall . That is Madame Sorel . Madame Agnes Sorel . She lived in the fifteenth century and she popularized the wearing of diamonds in the French court . She was probably the first commoner to wear diamonds and she had a collection of necklaces , brooches and buckles that were the wonder of her day . " And those other pictures . They are my masterpieces . They are the gems that have disappeared , that even I ca n't guess where they might be . There , that one , that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third largest diamond in the world , two hundred eighty carats . It disappeared around 1747 . And that one , the Cleveland , cut here in New York in 1884 , fifty carats , disappeared from view . There 's the Porter-Rhodes , and that one 's the Cross of Asia , one hundred nine carats , and the Red Cross , two hundred five carats , and the Florentine , and the Stewart , and the Julius Pam and the Pam and the Star of Egypt . Oh , if I could only find those darlings , oh , if . . . . " During this discourse Harry Diamond had changed . He had gotten out of his chair , taken off the raincoat and now , dressed in black pants , black wool shirt with a tan tie , standing tall , he was pointing out each picture like an orchestra conductor conducting a symphony . " Miss Bay , please excuse me if I am talking so much , " he said suddenly . " But it has been two years , more than two years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tradesman , a man selling newspapers . I am like a man suddenly brought back to humanity . Perhaps you 've noticed how clean my apartment is ? I clean it every day . It is my physical exercise . I go over every possible surface . Each book is dusted every day . This room , the bathroom , the kitchen . Go in , go ahead , look around , everything sparkles . I even polish the chrome pipes under the sinks . They shine , like band instruments . That 's because I am afraid to go out . I used to go out for  | my exercise at night , but now I am afraid of muggers so I go out for a brief time at noon , like today . I do my shopping then , buy food , the newspapers and magazines , and hurry home . I shall have to work on my walk . My stride , you say ? Do you think this is better ? " And he walked across the room stiffly , almost with a goose step . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I will find something . I will watch others walking down the street and copy . I will work it out . It will give me something else to do . I will beat them yet , you will see . " Do you see that ring bolted to the floor ? There , under the window ? Do you know what that is for ? It is my escape . Here , I 'll show you . " He walked to a large oak bucket she had presumed was being used as a wastebasket and pulled out the end of a braided yellow nylon rope . " You see , when there is a knock on the door and I do n't know who it is , I go out the window . I snap this buckle to the ring , throw the rope out and slide down . I keep these special gloves in here , too , and this gun . " He took both out to show her . " I have all of my valuables nearby , all in one garment , and I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than one minute . I practice it , at night . I have done it so often I can do it blindfolded . " But he had run out of things to say and his throat must have been tired . He looked around the room , as if for inspiration , then became sad again , humped his shoulders and walked over to a small settee and sat down . He reached into his pockets and came up with a package of cigarettes . He offered one to her and she shook her head . " I never used to smoke , " he said sadly . " I know it 's bad for your health . But under the circumstances . . . do you mind ? " " Yes , " she said . He accepted it easily , put the cigarette back into its pack and returned the pack to his pocket . " Harry , " she said . " The reason I came here was to ask you some questions about a case I am working on . I would appreciate any help you could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave her his rapt attention . She told him as much as she knew about the thefts and killings and he listened , intrigued . " I have read about the first two , " he said when she paused be- cause her throat was beginning to be sore . " I was certain at the time that there was more to it than the papers were saying . You never get the full story about diamond thefts in the newspapers . People who own diamonds do n't want it to be known how easy they are to steal . " " First thing I 'd like to ask you , Harry , does this sound like the work of anyone you know ? " He thought a moment . " It could be the work of any of ten people I know , those who deal in rough , except that I know of no one who might do so who is so intimate with the American wholesale market . The habits I mean . These must be learned over a long period of time . These diamond dealers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a person with information on the movement and whereabouts of these stones could have managed to take them . That is why I stole from private parties , and museums . And you also realize that I am not current in such things . I 've been away from it for the past few years . " She nodded her head . " Well , how would you go about disposing of them ? Where would you get the best prices ? " He thought again . It was obvious he was giving her his best . " I ... we used to sell our merchandise either back to the people we had taken it from or to their insurance companies . As far as rough is concerned , I would say the obvious markets are other diamond dealers , jewelers , people who would be able to recognize their value . It takes a certain amount of skill . " " Do you know , specifically , any of these people ? " she asked . He smiled . " Miss Bay , I do know who these people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world . Anywhere there is a diamond market you will find such people . But I can not give you any names . I hope you understand . " She accepted that with regret . " Perhaps I 'm not asking the correct questions . Are there any questions you would ask if you were in my place ? " He shook his head . " Miss Bay , I do n't think so . These are different , the little we really know about them , from any operations that I am familiar with , which is something I have already told you . The killings , for one thing . They have always distressed me . My people , the ones I trained , they would not kill . At least I taught  | them not to . No , I 'm afraid I ca n't be of any service to you . I regret it deeply . She started to put her coat on then and he jumped to his feet to help her . She turned around , smiled , and started to thank him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , taking her hand and patting it gently . " Miss Bay , I 'm going to have to be boorish . And I regret it . But I am very lonely . That is the worst thing I have to cope with . And I would like you to do a favor for me . " He paused and she waited . " Miss Bay , it has been a long . . . long time for me , sexually , that is , and I .... " " No , " she said . He dropped her hand , though gently . His Adam 's apple bobbed dryly . " Miss Bay , " he pleaded . " I am prepared to offer a gift in diamonds , a rather large gift , a foolishly large gift if .... " " No , " she repeated . He shook his head sadly , shrugged his shoulders and accepted it as though he had n't really expected anything else . At the door he took her hand again and this time kissed it gallantly . Then , without another word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was raining harder when she reached the street . She called her answering service from a booth in a bar on Sixth Avenue . Phil said that Miss Priest , Mr. Addabbo 's secretary , had called about an hour ago . It was urgent . When Miss Priest answered the telephone she was sobbing . There had been another theft and another killing .  | William Prettyman had been working on West Forty-seventh Street since 1952 , first as a delivery boy for Max 's Delicatessen , long since gone , running sandwiches , coffee and pastry from seven-thirty or eight in the morning , when the offices and lofts opened , until about six-thirty , when Max 's closed for the night . After two months at Max 's Prettyman took a second job as seven-to-midnight porter in one of the buildings on the street , and later that same year he asked Max 's cousin , who operated a kosher catering service in Queens , if he could work for him on weekends . Max 's cousin was delighted to have such a conscientious worker . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name was Sarah Rhodes and who worked as a seamstress in the garment center . In 1953 the Prettymans bought a house in St. Albans , Queens , and Mrs. Prettyman quit the garment center and took a job selling notions in the Gertz Department Store in Jamaica . Their first child , a boy , was born late in 1953 . Mrs. Prettyman returned to work six months later , the baby being cared for by her mother who lived with them and had helped with the down payment on the house . In 1954 William Prettyman suggested to a diamond manufacturer in the building where he worked as night porter , a man named Arthur Brown , that he use him to deliver merchandise to his customers in the metropolitan area . " You know that I am completely honest , " Prettyman had said , and Brown readily acknowledged that fact with a thoughtful nod of his head .  | " And you also know that I will be completely safe as no one in his right mind in this city would believe that you have trusted a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Which Arthur Brown also had to acknowledge . And the William Prettyman Service had its first client . Prettyman divested himself of his initial three jobs , one at a time , as other diamond people followed Arthur Brown onto his list of steady clients . Though there was difficulty getting himself bonded and insured for a million dollars because he was black , he was finally able to do so with the help of Arthur Brown , and in two years he was delivering diamonds and other precious stones , watches and jewelry to retail stores , factories and individuals all over the metropolitan area and soon included among his customers several of the largest and most prestigious jewelry shops on Fifth and Madison avenues . There were several unique things about the William Prettyman Service which for its entire existence operated from a rented desk in Arthur Brown 's loft factory . One , was that it remained a one-man operation , William Prettyman was not ever able to find it within him to trust others to carry hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of diamonds . Another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honest , and as unobvious a transporter of diamonds as might be found , was completely trustworthy . William Prettyman was never once sick , never too tired or busy to make a promised or scheduled delivery for a client , nor did he ever complain that the weather was too hot , too cold , or too wet . The only clients who ever had reason to complain about him were those who did n't pay their bills on time ; if payment was not received in his office by the tenth of the month William Prettyman dropped that particular account from his roster . The last thing worth mentioning is that William Prettyman corrected anyone who tried calling him Bill . By the early I960 's William Prettyman was carrying millions of dollars worth of diamonds by foot , bus , subway , suburban train or rented car , and earning well over $35,000 a year . By that time , too , being a client of the William Prettyman Service gave a firm a certain cachet , unimportant in itself and yet of undisputed value . At ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picked up $184,000 worth of polished gems from Joseph R.  | Tunick &; Co. , Inc. , diamond manufacturers , for delivery to Marcus Galleries , Inc. , operators of the leased jewelry concession in the Gimbel Brothers department store on West Thirty-third Street . The diamonds were wrapped in folded diamond parcel papers in a sealed manila envelope and carried in an inside buttoned pocket of William Prettyman 's overcoat , the same kind of buttoned pocket Sarah had sewn in all of his clothes . He had most likely used the IND subway entrance on West Forty-seventh Street for the short ride downtown . For at approximately 1o:48 , when the platform attendant at the large Thirtyfourth Street station was making his routine check of the men 's room , which he did at least once an hour to rout any of the derelicts , winos or addicts who sometimes gathered there , he found William Prettyman sitting on one of the toilets . As Robert Gesualdi , the attendant , later told a police stenographer : " This colored was sitting in the stall , you know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw that he did n't have his pants down , but his fly was open , just sitting there , his head leaning back like he was sleeping or was passed out , or something . So I said , Hey , you ! Get up ! ' He did n't move , so I went over to the locker where we keep the equipment and got a mop  --  I got keys for all of that ? and I used the handle to poke him in the shoulder , because sometimes these guys got knives and when they wake up they 're mean , and I poked him and yelled at him again to get up , and he just fell off the seat and got caught between the toilet and the partition there and I got one look at this guy 's face and I knew right away that he was dead , you know , even though he was colored his skin was , like , white , you know what I mean ? "  | Some of the same dirty raincoats , narrow-brimmed hats and wellfilled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the previous day were now gathered in similar huddles near the men 's room of the Thirty-fourth Street subway station . They were in a roped-off area which carried printed signs that said : CRIME SCENE SEARCH AREA STOP . She was too far away to hear what they were talking about but considering the amount of arm-slapping and hand-shaking she could but guess . All that could be seen of the men 's room itself was an open door and very bright lights beyond . She had to buy a subway token and pass through a turnstile before she could even approach the roped-off area . Two uniformed transit policemen guarded the entrance , both black , both well over six feet tall , one with sideburns that came down and connected to his mustache and the other with the tip of his right earlobe missing . She asked sideburns if he would please get Lieutenant James Dunn for her . " Is he transit or city , ma'am ? " " City . " " I do n't know if we got a Lieutenant Dunn in there . Willie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Willie answered positively and she moved away to wait . Television crews were now arriving with their equipment . While they set up , the reporters circulated among the clots of dirty raincoats . One reporter she had often seen on the six o'clock news . Even in the flesh he looked one-dimensional . He spoke with several  | police officials , made notes , peered into the men 's room once then came back to where his camera was waiting . A girl in blue jeans with stringy hair held a mirror for him while he straightened several hairs on his head , set his tie and smoothed his trench coat which was the last thing in the world that needed smoothing , indeed it looked as if it might be stored between angel feathers when it was n't being used . The reporter cleared his throat several times , the lights were turned on , and in the mellifluous tones that he was famous for , he began : " At one of the busiest subway stations in the world . . . . " It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William Prettyman , that there was no sign of a wound on his body and that it was possible that he had died of a heart attack . Also , that he had been a diamond messenger , that it was not known at that time whether he had been carrying any diamonds , but that his wallet had been found intact with sixty dollars in cash and several credit cards in it . The reporter then interviewed a transit police captain in front of the camera who repeated what he had just said only in New Yorkese . When they finished the lights were turned off , and the cameraman and crew quickly packed their gear and rushed toward the exit . The reporter was delayed by people who stopped him for his autograph . It was about then that Dunn arrived . He was again in plainclothes , his shield pinned to the lapel of a smart gray chesterfield coat . Two officers in uniform accompanied him , one a sergeant the other a patrolman . He was in earnest conversation with both of them which made for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked past the transit policemen at the opening in the roped-off area without seeing her . When they were almost to the men 's room the three of them stopped , and Dunn gave a whole series of complicated instructions to the patrolman , using his finger to drive home the points . The patrolman was at least ten years older than he . She saw that he was wearing the miniature shield cuff links that day , too . When he finished the patrolman nodded several times and quickly walked out of the station . Dunn , with now only the sergeant in tow , went directly into the men 's room , people standing to one side to make way for him . When he  | emerged a few minutes later he was dictating to the sergeant who was writing furiously in a black hip notebook . She approached the transit policemen at the gate again , pointed Dunn out , and gave Willie an oblong card with her name on it . She asked him to please deliver it . When Dunn received the card he looked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he nodded and continued dictating to his sergeant . When he did start over he stopped several times to add things for the sergeant to write down . " Miss Bay , " he said from the other side of the rope , smiling warmly , extending his hand . " We seem to be meeting regularly . " When she shook his hand she was conscious of the fact that she had just joined the crime-site jamboree . " It 's all right , " Dunn said to Willie and sideburns as he escorted her through the opening in the ropes . " We 're not yet certain whether this was a holdup and murder , " he said as they made their way toward the men 's room . " Or if Prettyman died first of a heart attack , someone found him , went through his pockets and took what he was carrying . It 's quite possible we 'll never find out . We 're not yet certain that he was carrying anything . " The stink of urine and strong cleaning fluids burned her nostrils and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door . But she controlled herself . Just before they stepped inside the sergeant tapped Dunn 's shoulder , and he stopped to speak with him . She walked in alone . Photographers , fingerprint specialists , and other technicians were working over every inch of the room . One was even examining the ceiling through a large Sherlock Holmes kind of magnifying glass . Prettyman 's body had been removed . " Hey , you , " someone shouted . " You ! Miss ! Woman ! " She stopped and turned . It was a red-headed man with a round freckled face , red hairs poking out of his nose and ears . There was a gold detective 's badge pinned to the breast pocket of the cheap jacket he was wearing causing the whole garment to sag . He was pointing a filthy finger with very little nail on it at her . " You , yeah , you . Where the hell do you think you 're going ? " " That 's all right , officer , " she said . " I wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the room to see if they were as  | outraged as he was . " Goddamn right you wo n't touch anything . Who the hell are you anyway , a reporter ? That do n't mean a damn thing around here . This is a men 's room . Supposing one of us was urinating right now and you came barging in here like this ? " She looked first at him and then at the others to see if they were serious . He was , and they seemed to be , too . " Oh , is that what those things are for ? " she asked . The detective 's round face went slack for a moment and then tightened . His eyes hardened and he blushed . He was about to snap something , but Dunn appeared . " I 'm sorry , " Dunn said to her . " I had to tell the sergeant something . Please excuse me . " Then turning to the men in the room who were all staring at them he introduced her . " This is Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case that might include this one . Be nice to her . " And he smiled . " Oh , " the redheaded detective said . " So you 're a clit ? " Everyone else laughed . " Do n't you get it ? " he asked . " Me dick . You clit ? " They roared where only a few hours before William Prettyman had died due to still unknown causes . They laughed so loud that some of the dirty raincoats poked their thin-brimmed fedoras in to see what was happening . When it was explained to them they laughed too and left to spread the word to the remainder of the convention . Dunn laughed too . Eventually , and mostly for self-protection , she smiled . " Thank you , Lieutenant , " she said , stepping out of the room , Dunn following her . " Charity , I hope you 're not hurt . These homicide people , they have a weird sense of humor , as you might imagine , and feeling is n't their long suit . " " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's just that I wonder why I even came down here . There 's nothing to see . Looking at a crime site , if this is one , has never helped anyone yet " " You 're right , " he said . " The only reason I 'm here is because it is more or less expected of me . But I 've never gotten anything from it either . It 's the reports , that 's where I sometimes find answers . And speaking about reports , I 've got a ton of them that I can go over  | with you if you 'd like , lab stuff , medical examiner 's , and so on . Have you got any time now ? " His car was a black Chevrolet devoid of ornament , perhaps two years old . The only way one could possibly tell that it was an official car was by the thin telephone antenna sticking out of the roof and by the fact that it was parked comfortably in a tow-away zone . A driver , in civilian clothes , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every so often on a clipboard . Dunn held the door for her , then went around and got in on the other side . The car was filled with cigarette smoke and the first thing she did was to open her window all the way . The driver glanced up at her through the rearview mirror . He handed Dunn the clipboard before he started the engine , then bullied his way into the stream of traffic . Dunn read the notes thoroughly and circled two items with a ball-point pen that was attached to the board . By the time he handed the clipboard back they were turning onto Park Avenue heading north . She considered herself as good a judge of the face behind the face as anyone she knew and as far as she could determine Dunn seemed sincere , and she put him through some of her most rigorous tests . He did n't once glance down at her knees , which were very much in evidence , not even a quick side glance while pretending to get something out of his eye . She might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that point , their relationship had been that of two complete equals . He had never once shown any sign of superiority . It seemed as if he was genuinely interested in sharing information with her . Except . . . except it seemed to her that they should have been turning off Park Avenue by then . But she did n't know where the Third Division had its headquarters and she could n't be sure . The driver did turn east on Seventy-fourth Street , then north on First Avenue , and west on Seventy-fifth Street , stopping in the middle of the block before a row of very expensive houses . " This is where I live , " Dunn said . " I hope you do n't mind . I often work here . I was working on this thing last night and all of the files are upstairs . I 'm sure you 've been in some of the precinct houses in this city and if you have you know why I prefer doing my real thinking at home . " How , she wondered , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ? Maybe his circling the items on the clipboard had been some kind of signal ? It was one of those buildings that are too few and fast disappearing from the city . The front door frame was in sleek black enamel , the oval of thick glass was etched with a sunburst pattern . Behind the glass was a clean white curtain gathered and tied at its waist . The door handle was a brass fishtail , highly polished . Inside , the small vestibule was painted an immaculate white and there were black and white marble squares on the floor . Real marble . There was a polished brass letter box inserted in one wall , a gilt , marbletopped table with a vase of fresh cut carnations against the other one . Immediately inside the hall was a graceful staircase , but Dunn guided her around to the left , along a vermilion figured runner to a small , certainly no larger than three-passenger , elevator . Entering it was like entering a jewel box . The ceiling was made of curved mirrors and gilded strips . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , framed by polished mahogany everywhere else . The floor was covered by the same figured vermilion as the hall . When Dunn closed the elaborate brass grille and pressed the button the elevator rose silently and so dreamily that she had the feeling of being transported up and out of this world . His apartment occupied the entire third floor . The door opened directly onto the large living room . The first thing one saw was a rose marble fireplace with a large painting of someone 's ancestor over it . Tastefully placed around the room were couches , chairs , tables , oriental rugs and lamps . Everything was in harmony with everything else , everything fitted , like in the rooms in department store windows . " There 's a sun room out in front that I use as a study , " he said , taking her coat and hanging it in a beautiful antique armoire at one side of the door . " In the back is the dining room , kitchen , two bedrooms and a bathroom , in that order . Would you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head and stepped onto one of the rugs , Persian she guessed , feeling the luxuriousness of it under her feet . She was envious . Compared to this she was living in squalor  --  expensive squalor but squalor nevertheless . Compared to this , her place was a hogan.  | She had bought her furniture , intact , from the previous tenant , the one who had pointed out the apartment 's concentration-camp possibilities . What really amazed her about the room was that nothing was really ostentatious , as is usually the case with such deliberately decorated places . This was just comfortable , plus . " Ordinarily , " Dunn said as if guessing what was just stepping into her mind , " I could n't afford a place like this . But the owner of the building is a friend of mine . He lives downstairs . He says it 's a form of insurance having a cop in the house . So I get a consideration on the rent . I 'm lucky . Sit down . Would you like something to drink ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the couch which was covered by a simple but spectacular American Indian rug or blanket . " Tea ? " he asked with the first phony smile she had seen on him . " An Irish household without tea ? My dear sweet mother drank nothing but tea . " He even affected a bit of a brogue , especially around the r 's . He started toward the rear then turned . " Why do n't you make yourself at home and look around if you want to ? I 'll be a few minutes . I want to get out of this jacket , and this shoulder holster , too . " There was a large antiquey kind of desk in the sun room , a day bed between the two large windows which was also covered by a spectacular Indian rug or blanket , an elaborate type of chest with many narrow drawers , each with its own keyhole . She quickly went through the letters on top of the desk . Nothing important , a bill from Bloomingdale 's , another one from Con Edison , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that began , " Dear Brother , " thanked him for an anniversary present and went on to tell him about her husband 's new job . There was also an announcement of a meeting of the Police Lieutenants ' Benevolent Association and a personal note from the executive director of the Catholic Big Brothers thanking him for some letters he had written for them . The chest with the thin drawers was locked . She tried several of them but none yielded . She then felt behind and underneath it for a key but did n't find any . When she heard the clinking of things she returned to the living room . He had put on a tan cashmere cardigan and had taken off his tie though not his cuff links . The tray was made of mock tortoise shell .  | He had made a drink for himself , either gin or vodka , she could n't tell from where she stood . There was not only a small tea pot on the tray but a steaming hot water kettle as well . " I did n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And , of course , sugar , " he said as he placed fhe tray down . " Lemon will be fine , thank you . " The lemon slices had crinklecut edges . She was a little disappointed when he first did n't warm the cup before he put tea into it but when she held it in her hand she realized it had been well warmed before being brought out . They sat for a time on opposite ends of the couch as if balancing it . The tea was magnificent , and she was able to recognize that it had n't come from the A &; P. " That big chest with all the drawers in the sun room is where I keep my coins , " he said after a moment . " That 's my hobby , numismatics . American and British coins . Mostly American . I 've been collecting them ever since I was a kid . The chest belonged to a Connecticut dentist . It was built around Igoo , made especially for his tools . It 's stained oak . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a handsome piece , do n't you think ? " She nodded , sipped the delicious tea . " Now , " he said , placing his drink on the table and reaching down , businesslike , alongside the couch to bring up a large cardboard envelope . He lifted it to his lap and untied the strings . " Here we are , medical examiner 's autopsy reports , fingerprint analyses , chemical analyses , background reports on Silber , Greenberg , and Sandler , interviews with family , friends , business associates , analyses of bank accounts , deposits , withdrawals , and so forth .. . everything the most modern criminal investigating machine can come up with . Unfortunately , the whole thing adds up to zero . The only thing I am reasonably certain of is that all three crimes were committed by the same people and that they were amateurs , almost hobbyists . " " Amateurs ? " " There 's a combination of skill and clumsiness in all of these crimes that is almost unique . At least I 've never run across anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to the smallest possible detail , and probably practiced , like in dry runs , do you know what I mean ? And then a mistake is made , a big mistake ,  | like leaving a chloroformed towel over a man 's head . They obviously were n't knowledgeable enough about chloroform to know that too much of it can kill a person , or that it can cause vomiting and that if the vomitus ca n't be expelled it will choke a person . There are other things , too . Like the towels used . They had been washed hundreds of times . Our chemists were even able to find out the kind of detergent they had been washed in . Dreft , I think it 's called . These people chose towels that were going to have to be thrown out soon anyway and used them in their crimes . Professionals would n't have done it that way . They usually do n't like using personal things in their business . For one thing , of course , personal items can be traced a lot more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Professional crooks are very superstitious . " But on the other hand the people who accomplished these jobs were quite knowledgeable about the diamond business . They had to be first to know how diamonds are brought into this country and then to pick out three men who had just gotten their allotments of rough , and to also know which ones had Diamond Trading Company privileges . This is not information that is shouted from rooftops . Most diamond men do n't talk about their business , not even to their families . A woman married to someone in the business knows as much about diamonds as anyone else , that a diamond is forever and maybe that it pays her bills . " " What about William Prettyman ? " she asked . " We do n't know very much yet , I think I already mentioned that . But if he was carrying anything , and it 's missing , that would be very , very suspicious . That 's another thing , a person would have to be involved in the business some way to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questioning people in the business ? " " We have a list of those with criminal records , of course , I have it here , somewhere . There are about thirty names on it . Most of them are fences , or suspected of being fences . Some have served time . We 've questioned a few of them , the most suspicious , and all of them are probably aware that they are being watched . But we 've got nothing . We do n't honestly think that any of them are involved . If , of course , one of them starts handling unaccounted-for rough or even cut stuff , we 'll know it pretty soon and nab him . " One of our biggest problems  --  and it 's always a problem dealing  | with Forty-seventh Street  --  is that these diamond people are the most tight-lipped people in the world . Even if they did know , or even suspected that someone they knew was involved , they would n't come to us . We 're the authorities , and they stay as far away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do with taxes . They 're notorious tax dodgers . There 've been estimates made that up to sixty-five percent of all business done in diamonds is in cash and never reported . It 's just a guess of course . No , they like to solve their problems among themselves but they 'll always be the first to complain that they 're not getting enough police protection . " They 're very clannish , too . The vast majority of them  --  as I 'm sure you 've noticed if you 've even walked on Forty-seventh Street ? are Jews , and we are goyim . If you do n't already know , that means non-Jews . If they are secretive with each other , they are almost in another world when it comes to dealing with outsiders . They 've got their own language . I do n't just mean Yiddish , though they 'll use that if they think you do n't understand it . I mean a sort of code language . It 's also used by auctioneers . Like the phrase two-ten ' means to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over there , ' they mean that your two eyes should watch his ten fingers . They can be discussing how much they think you 're likely to pay for a piece of jewelry , in English , right in front of you , and you wo n't be aware of it . Have you noticed the way they dress ? I do n't mean the Hasidim , the ones with the long black coats , with the beards . Hasidim , by the way , means pious ' in Hebrew . And those little black silk skullcaps they wear are called yarmulkes . I mean the others , the civilians . They dress down , so that you wo n't suspect them of carrying a couple of hundred thousand dollars of diamonds in their pockets , which might very well be the case . But in doing so they stick out like a flashing red light . I can spot one of them in a crowd at Madison Square Garden or in the subway . " " Do you think it 's possible that one of the dead men 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give that information to someone else , sell it or was forced to for some reason ? " she asked . " I guess it 's possible , " he answered . " Anyway , we 've thought about it , it 's almost an automatic procedure . You look into the family for someone with , say , a record . But the only one who might fit  | here is Simon Sandler 's daughter , Rhoda something , no , Mona Rhoda Sandler , that 's it . She 's a kid , about twenty , ran away from home , got mildly involved with drugs . She was once picked up , along with some others , for possession of pot and hash . They did n't find anything on her , and they let her go without charging her . " " What about the other end ? " she asked . " London . Could there be someone there who is selling or using the information about these men who pick up diamonds ? " " As I say , anything 's possible . But again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience , and they 're prepared for anything . They spend good money , and lots of it , keeping tabs on everyone who works for them , even in tangential jobs . " " The last thing I can think of to ask you right at this minute is about informers , " she said . " What about yours ? Whoever has these diamonds now is going to have to dispose of them some time . " " Well , admittedly we have a problem there . If these crooks are in the diamond business , they will have very little difficulty getting rid of the stuff . They 'd do it in dribs and drabs over a period of years . And they probably would be able to do it in the open market . There 's no way that you can identify an uncut stone . If Prettyman was carrying finished stuff the manufacturer would be able to identify it . But even finished diamonds can be broken down and recut . There 's also the very strong possibility that if Prettyman was carrying stones , rough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it could have been done by crooks other than the ones who killed Silber , Greenberg , and Sandler . We 're in a complicated mess here . I ca n't impress that upon you enough . " Now about our informers . We 're not that big on informers in something like diamonds . Our biggest guns are in drugs . FBI has good informers . And Treasury has some , too . But in all honesty we do n't work well with them . For one thing they 're prima donnas and we 're peasants . Most of them are WASPS , and we are mostly Catholic in the department , with a sprinkling of other unloved minorities . " " It was then that he chose to make his move . He was very direct about it ; there were no hesitations or awkward preliminaries , as one sometimes finds in similar situations . Suddenly , without any warning , he got up from his end of the couch and sat down beside her .  | She started to smile , laugh really , it was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kidding , as if this was absurd , that it really could n't be , after all . . . . But he put his arm around her and pulled her to him and before she could say anything his mouth was on hers . He was strong and there was no pushing him away . Besides , she was unwilling to fight . This was ridiculous , outrageous , and to fight back would give it a legitimacy it did n't deserve . So she simply went limp . But he continued pressing his mouth against hers for several more seconds , oblivious of the fact that she was completely unresponsive . " Lieutenant , " she said icily when he stopped , and attempted to move away . But he was unbuttoning her blouse and pulling it out of her skirt . She struck at him then , angrily , tried to push him away , but he warded her off easily with the blade of his arm . He put both arms around her again and when she reached out to grab for his windpipe he caught her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaf . She wriggled for a time , in vain , and then went limp again , refusing to dignify , if that was the correct word , the whole , silly stupid thing . He was kissing her again , and she felt his hand on her knee , but what really amazed her was her inability to protect herself . Other times , in similar situations , she had been able to grab a windpipe or go for the eyes . She was like a damned puppet in his hands , a toy , a lousy , stinking toy and that hurt as much as anything . He seemed to be able to do whatever he wanted to with her , and it was n't something she was used to . She felt things being pulled off her and his hands on her bare flesh . " Lieutenant , " she said again , almost as angry with herself as she was with him . " Lieutenant , please , I .... " But he was pushing her down on the couch , holding her down with his arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess at . This was it , she told herself . She was going to kill him , maybe gouge out his eyes , she told herself . It was just as she felt the full weight of his body that the key turned in the lock and the front door opened wide . Dunn released her and she popped up like a jack-in-the-box.  | That 's a doctor 's wife for sure , she thought , looking at the woman who stood frozen in the doorway ; somehow you can always tell a doctor 's wife . The woman wore a smart red fox jacket and matching hat and looked quite stunning . She even had on one of those white-on-white silk scarves with a huge , undecipherable red monogram on it . She had come bursting into the room with a big smile , and she was carrying a bottle of champagne in a paper bag . Dunn jumped to his feet and first tried to hide his nakedness but when that proved too difficult he ran , bent over , almost double , toward the rear of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pornographic hunchback of Notre Dame . She caught her breath and to calm herself rested her head against the back of the couch . She was still a little dizzy but very much relieved , and only vaguely aware of what a mess she must have seemed , her skirt askew , her blouse pulled out and almost completely unbuttoned . But she managed a smile . " Hi , " she said . " I 'm Miss Charity Bay . " The woman examined her with obvious disgust . Her original smile had long since fled , but she did manage something , a sardonic twist with a glistening of hatred on it . She then examined Charity , deliberately and with a difficultly managed cool . " And I , " she said too loudly , a little forced and a little hysterically , but with each syllable enunciated clearly , " am , or at least used to be , Miss **31;1232;TOOLONG . " With that she threw the bottle of champagne as hard as she could , and it exploded upon impact with the rose marble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the room . She slammed the door behind her .  | She called her answering service on the way home that evening , but there were no messages . She made herself a quick dinner of canned tuna fish , canned pears , chocolate cookies , and tea . Her neck hurt where Dunn had held her head down . Unfortunately , it was the exact same spot Louis Gross ' thug had bruised the night before . Swallowing her food came a little easier , but not much . After putting the dishes into the washer , she took a second cup of tea to her desk and tried to inventory her thoughts on a lined yellow legal pad . The first words she wrote down were " lousy stinking son of a bitch . " And she underlined it several times . Then she shook it out of her head , drew a line through it and tried to concentrate on what she knew about the thefts thus far , first writing each of the dead men 's names , one per line . She put the word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she added a question mark next to the word . Nothing , absolutely nothing , that 's what she knew . She had no clues , no bunches , nothing , just the bare facts about theft and murder . And not all of the facts at that . When she found herself writing " son of a bitch " again she tore the paper from the pad , crumpled it and threw it into the wastebasket . At eight-thirty she decided that her dinner was sufficiently digested , took her exercise mat out of the closet , stripped to the skin , put the Vivaldi record on she worked to and began to work out . She had a routine and she stuck to it . First were the series of stretching exercises , trunk , neck , waist , legs , and arms . Her body was sore and stiff , from the beatings she had taken within the past two days and the fact that she had n't been able to exercise while  | working on the case in Germany . And she was still tired and still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soreness seemed to dissolve within itself a little and she breathed more easily and her movements became more fluid and satisfying . When she finished the stretching , she jogged in place for twenty minutes , her usual amount of time , and then added another five . After that she did sit-ups , back-flexes on her stomach and finally leg-lifts . At the end she was panting hard , and her body was covered with sweat . She slipped into a short white terry cloth robe and started a bath going . She was putting the exercise mat away when the telephone rang . " Miss Bay ? " She recognized Addabbo 's voice . " Yes . " " This is Sylvan Addabbo , I. . . " " Would you please hold on , Mr. Addabbo ? " she interrupted . " I would like to take this on another extension . " She set up the conference attachment , eased herself into the hot water and fixed the bath pillow behind her head . Then she flicked the switch on . " Yes , sir , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " First , " Addabbo said , " I 'd like to explain that I got your home number from Lieutenant Dunn . It 's unlisted , and I neglected to get it from you when you were here , I hope you do n't mind , but I thought it important that I 'm able to speak with you anytime day or night . " " That 's quite all right , " she answered . She worked her neck under the hot water and it felt good . " I was just wondering , " he went on , " if you 've made any progress ? If there is anything you can tell me that I might pass along to my clients ? " " Nothing so far , Mr. Addabbo , " she said . She noticed that some of the bruises were beginning to turn yellow around their edges . " Ugh , Miss Bay , your voice sounds strange , maybe we have a bad connection , I hear noises in the background . Like running water . Do you have any reason to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have every reason to believe that it might be tapped , " she an- swered . " But the noise you hear in the background is water . I 'm taking a bath . " " A bath , Miss Bay ? " he said after a pause . " Miss Bay , I 'd like to impress upon you , if I have n't already , the urgency in this work you are doing for us . People , my clients , are apprehensive about making commitments for bringing in more diamonds to New York . We have been in contact with the Diamond Trading Company and they are concerned , as well . And then there are the various reinsurance companies . That , of course , does n't mean we are in panic , yet , but , I would have assumed . . . . " He seemed to be looking for the correct words and when he was unable to find them , she said : " Mr. Addabbo , I 'm sorry , but I have no more idea as of this moment who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had when I first met you , or how yet to put a stop to it , short of placing guards next to every diamond merchant . But these things do take some time and you 'll just have to appreciate that fact . This is the real world and not some plot you 're seeing on television . " " Of course , " he answered . " You 're right . But you must understand my apprehension . However , Miss Bay , I would appreciate , indeed , I must insist that from now on you telephone me at least once a day to report on your progress , or lack of progress . " " Will do , " she answered . " Good night . " The call had taken the magic out of the bath , and she washed quickly , put on a pair of smart-looking red nylon pajamas and went to bed . Thursday was a cold , bleak day with a bitter , stinging wind . She made her telephone calls from the battery of booths in Grand Central Station , starting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a ship 's purser , lived when not at sea . Hodgson was at home . Using the kind of double-talk he preferred he said it did n't pay for her to come down to see him because he had a cold , which meant that he had no information of any kind to give her . She also called Mexico City , Acapulco , and El Paso , Texas , getting two of the three men out of bed , but again there was nothing of interest for her . Nor were there any messages at the answering service . She arrived at the Third Division headquarters , which also served as the Seventeenth Precinct house , at about eleven that  | morning . The police occupied part of a large office building with a separate entrance on East Fifty-first Street and their own separate garage . The desk sergeant was a square-shouldered blond woman with heavy , assertive breasts who controlled the stream of traffic in and out with an incredible ease , missing no one and managing to take care of every minute detail and answer the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said when the sergeant 's attention was turned to her . " George or James ? " " James . " " Up the stairs one flight , turn left , third or fourth door on your right , I forget which . " Both the staircase and hallway were lined with municipal tile . The third door was the correct one , Dunn 's name had been painted on it . A handwritten sign affixed with scotch tape said , " Walk Right In . " Inside were two offices , an outer one with green gray anonymous furniture , all in a battered condition . A frosted glass partition separated the other office . " Can I help you ? " Dunn 's voice called out from behind the partition . She walked to the door and was pleased that the bastard showed surprise and even blushed . " Charity ! " he finally said , coming up with a boyish smile . " Come on in . Put your things on the rack and sit down . " Part of a smirk still showed when she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missing from its comb back . He looked good , as if he had n't a worry in the world . He was in shirt sleeves , a neat blue shirt with a maroon tie , the miniature badge on the tie clasp as well as on the ubiquitous cuff links . He had a small pistol in a holster on his right hip . " You 're the best thing that 's happened to me all morning , " he said , leaning back in his swivel chair , putting his hands behind his head , carefully so as not to disturb his hair . " I hope I 'm not disturbing you , " she said . " I took the chance that you were in . I really do n't like to call before visiting people , it gives them a chance to compose themselves , put on the phony face , the cowboy look . "  | He laughed , and she did , too . " I really came down " ? she went on ? " to examine those reports we started on yesterday . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his ch4ir . " You 're perfectly welcome to go through them . The only thing I must ask is that you do n't make copies of them . Not that there is any regulation against it , really , it 's just that it 's against procedure . You understand . " " Promise , " she said . " Fair enough . " He took three large manila folders from one of the drawers and placed them on the top of the desk . He opened each one and removed an envelope stamped " U.S. Treasury Department . Confidential " and put them into the top drawer , locking it with a key from a ring he kept in his pocket . " Take your time , " he said , getting up , putting on a blazer with gold buttons on it , the lieutenant 's shield pinned to the lapel . " I 've got to see someone down the hall . But do n't leave before I get back . I wo n't be long . If the telephone rings just ignore it , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was at the door when he said , " Oh , by the way , have you ever heard of a man who goes by the name Harry Diamond ? That 's not his real name , but no one has any other for him . " " Yes , I have , " she said . " Oh ? Well , then you may also know that he 's wanted by the French police for questioning about a suspected diamond theft . We got a flyer from Interpol this morning , I guess as a response to an inquiry we sent them . They say he might be somewhere on this continent . Maybe Mexico . We 've asked for cooperation from the federal police down there . But he could be involved in our thing . At least he 's worth questioning . " She nodded . In his file there were photographs of each dead man , one a recent snapshot ; the others were of the bodies taken from many different angles . She quickly went through the papers until she found the list of diamond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She folded it and put it into her purse . Then she began to read the various reports . They were in duplicate and covered everything from detailed chemical analyses of the dirt found under each man 's fingernails , to the contents of his stomach to an estimate of the state of his health twenty-four hours before he died . There  | was a ballistics report on the bullet that had killed Simon Sandler . It had been fired from a .38 caliber pistol and there was a microphotograph of the slug showing the marks made by the barrel grooves . There were reports on the estimated state of each man 's business going back over the past three years . There were copies of cablegram communications between Dunn and the security forces of the Diamond Trading Company and transcripts of recorded telephone conversations with the chief security officer of the Consolidated Diamond Mines of Southwest Africa , Ltd. in Oranjemund , South Africa . There were notes taken during interviews with the dead men 's families and business associates . But it all added up to nothing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished with the files she took a large paper clip from the top of the desk , straightened part of it and used it to open the top drawer of the desk . The three confidential Treasury envelopes contained data taken from the dead men 's tax returns , probably an illegal procedure , she thought . No wonder they stamped it confidential . Monroe Silber had large holdings of gold mining stocks . Greenberg owned U.S. Treasury notes and New York City first mortgage bonds . Simon Sandler had several pieces of rental property in Yonkers , New York , was part owner of the building at 31 West Forty-seventh Street , and a partner in a retail jewelry store in Commack , Long Island . She copied the address and put it into her purse . Then she returned the confidential envelopes to the drawer and locked it , remembering to reshape the paper clip and place it exactly on the same spot on the top of the desk from which she had first picked it up . When Dunn returned a little after noon she was reading leisurely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . She shook her head . " Is there anything not in these that I should know ? " " No , " he said . " You are now almost as well-informed about these cases as I am . How about lunch ? " " All right , " she answered . " Hey , great . " And he leaped over to the coat rack and held her coat . The restaurant was within walking distance . It was called  | George 's and had a tiled floor with sawdust on it , dark wood , streaked mirrors and etched glass partitions between the booths . Though there was a line waiting to be seated the maitre d ' beckoned to Dunn as soon as they walked in . ' The waiters wore black vests , bow ties and white aprons that reached down to their ankles . They sat in a booth and their waiter was Irish , a very old man with the eyes and ears of a pixie . He shuffled rather than walked and called Dunn , Jimmy , and asked if he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said that it had been very pleasant , and thanked him . Charity ordered a dry Lillet with a twist of lemon peel , no ice . Dunn asked for a Bushmills on the rocks with a water chaser . For some reason that she could n't understand he wanted to impress her with his Irishness . " I only want to say one thing more about the cases and then we 'll forget about them , " he said before the drinks came . " And that is that the probability of finding these crooks gets smaller every day . We have already started taking men off the case  --  we get a lot of work to do . The greatest favor they can do us is to keep striking . The next time , or the one after that , they might make a mistake . That 's not a great deal to hope for , or to wish , but that 's all there is . " When the drinks arrived they clinked glasses and he began telling her about his mother . She had been an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while keeping her policeman husband barely on this side of alcoholism . Dunn was very proud of her and said she had lived a great deal by instinct and intuition and that nothing could swerve her when she thought she was right . She had had very little education herself , could barely read and write , but she insisted that all of her children be educated in the city schools rather than in the ones run by the Church . People had castigated her for it , she became a sort of outcast , but she had held her ground insisting that one could be a devout Catholic and still send her children to public schools where , she said , they would get a better education . " A remarkable woman , " Dunn said , sipping at his whiskey . " I miss her . I was aware of the need for women 's liberation when I was ten years old . But I 'm talking too much . What 's your background ? Where are you from ? "  | Mr. Crowley had shuffled up to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She ordered a lamb chop and gave Mr. Crowley specific instructions that it be burned just lightly on the outside , mostly along the bone , but at the same time she wanted it pink and moist on the inside . Just before the chef was ready to take it off the fire she wanted it barely sprinkled with large grained salt and freshly ground pepper . She did n't want a potato or the string beans , but she did want a salad . She preferred mixing her own dressing though would Mr. Crowley please bring a separate bowl to turn the greens in , if they did n't have one a soup bowl would do , and a cup to mix the dressing in ? Mr. Crowley 's face remained noncommittal during all of these intricate instructions , and he barely wrote four words on his pad . Dunn watched her performance with amazement , and he ordered the corned beef and cabbage and a Heineken 's beer . Mr. Crowley brought the salad material first . The greens were a little too wet for her taste , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , vinegar , pepper and mustard in the cup , stirring it well , tasting it from the tip of her pinky until she had it right . Their meat courses arrived at the same time . The lamb chop was several inches thick , done exactly the way she had ordered it , down to the charred edges along the bone . For a time they ate without speaking ; she was very hungry . When Dunn was about halfway through his corned beef he patted his mouth , took a drink from his beer glass , and again asked where Charity was from . But her mouth was full of food , and she pointed at it and managed a smile . He shrugged and went back to eating . He asked several more times during the meal , but each time he seemed to catch her with a mouthful of food . The lamb chop was sensational . When they finished , Mr. Crowley took the plates away and asked about dessert . Dunn said that George 's was famous for its chocolate cake , but she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece for himself . She asked Mr. Crowley if the coffee was any good and he answered that it was special . She said she would try it . Dunn ordered tea . The coffee was sensational , too , strong and tasty and hot , and she drank it black . She turned down Dunn 's offer of part of the choco- late cake . When he finished it he looked at her and said that she might as well tell him something about herself because he could easily find out anything he wanted to know by calling the secretary of state 's office and asking for the data behind her investigator 's license . When Mr. Crowley brought the check on a plate he gave it to Dunn and asked if she had enjoyed her meal . She said very much , and the old man smiled . " Lieutenant , " she said when Mr. Crowley had shuffled away . " Jimmy .. " Jimmy . I think I should be allowed to pay for the lunch and I would appreciate it very much if you would allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For one thing , " she went on , " this is my business and I can take it off as an expense . " " What are some of the other things ? " he asked . " The other thing is that I probably make anywhere from two to four times what you make and I can afford it a lot more than you " Charity , " he answered , " it may be business for you , but it is a pleasure for me . " He took the check , did the addition , then searched through his wallet for an American Express card . They stood outside of George 's for a moment , Dunn glancing at watch . " Why do n't we go to my place and bat around some Ideas ? Maybe we 'll come up with something . " She patted his arm and signaled an approaching taxi . " Thanks for the lunch , Jimmy . I 'm sorry I ca n't take you up on it , but I 've got a million things to do . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helped her into the cab . It was past three when she arrived at the mezzanine of the Hilton Hotel . She shed her coat and spent the remainder of the afternoon calling new contacts . She realized more and more with each call bow pathetic the attempt was , but there was nothing else to go on . At one point these people were going to have to dispose of their diamonds . And she wanted to know about it when they did . Many things were being offered for sale , but no uncut diamonds . The last call she made that afternoon was to Addabbo . He was busy and his  | secretary , Miss Priest , asked if it was important . She answered no , just to tell Mr. Addabbo that she had called . That evening she finished the remains of the tuna fish perched on a swivel stool in the kitchen and , of course , cookies and tea . After she had taken care of the dishes and wiped up the crumbs she sat with her feet up against the back of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She managed to do both her fingernails and toe nails . When she felt it was time she got up and did her exercises , working extra hard , partly because her body felt as if it were back to normal and partly to punish herself . She was straining toward the end and exhausted when she put the terry cloth robe on . She lay with her legs up in the air until her pulse returned to almost normal . Afterward she bathed and went to bed .  | She was up at six , awakened by someone else 's alarm clock , a little stiff but definitely not sore and for the first time since her return not suffering from any of the effects of the jet lag . She had canned plums , cookies and tea for breakfast while listening to the radio to find out about the weather . She had to go through the usual murders , muggings and fires before she was able to learn that it was a cloudy , overcast day , and the temperature would range somewhere in the mid to upper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slight chance of snow later that evening . She chose an old pleated red-and-beige skirt to wear that day and a simple long-sleeved coral-colored shirt , plus low-heeled comfortable shoes . After she was dressed , she worked at her desk for a while , going through the mail , which was beginning to pile up . Before she left the apartment she had another cup of tea and one cookie . She chose a knee-length brown tweed overcoat , warm as well as girlish , and very ordinary ; she did n't want to draw any attention to herself . She also put on the tan scarf and beret combination . She telephoned the answering service from a cigar and newspaper store on Second Avenue . Leslie Heyman had called that morning first thing and had left a message that all was well . " She said you 'd know what that meant , " Phil said . " And there was a call about four A.M. from a William Schlendorf of Minneapolis . He says you 're to get in touch with him any time before New Year 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after that . He says you know where to reach him . He says he may have something for you . " Schlendorf  | was a contact she had called on Wednesday . Maybe this was the beginning of good news , and it made her feel a little better . The taxi let her off on the corner of Fifth Avenue and West Forty-seventh Street . And she began right off to look up those men on Dunn 's list , the ex-convicts and the ones the police had reason to suspect . She had no intention of interviewing them , just wanted to see what they looked like . If she ever saw them again , she would at least be able to recognize their faces . She started at the address closest to Fifth Avenue , a man named Stephen Brill who had a booth in a jewelry exchange several doors up from the avenue . He looked more like a minister than a crook . Forty-seventh Street between Fifth and Sixth avenues was a grimy block lined with grim buildings . The ground level was almost exclusively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and only in this block could so many precious things be made to look so ordinary , so tawdry even . Though it was a cold day the sidewalks were jammed to overflowing with an unbelievable mixture of people , flashily dressed men mostly , men in studiously ordinary clothes and Hasidic Jews who moved to their own rhythms . Diamonds , watches and jewelry were being sold openly on the sidewalks or in the doorways mostly , it seemed , by one merchant to another . The street itself was lined with a crazy illogical stream of traffic and the honking and blaring of horns was all but overwhelming . The jewelry exchanges which dotted both sides of the street were made up of hundreds of tiny booths , some only several inches wider than the hips of the men or women who stood behind the counters . The displays were unbelievable , diamonds , rings , jewelry of every type , watches , trinkets . Some of the booths were occupied by craftsmen , engravers , setters , watchmakers and jewelers who worked over tiny benches and which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch . The aisles were crowded with people arguing , talking animatedly , bargaining with one another . One thing that she noticed walking up and down the aisles of the exchanges searching out her pigeons was that many of the men behind the tiny counters carried guns , in shoulder or belt holsters or weighing heavily in jacket pockets . One man had a pistol stuck  | into the waist of his trousers and in one booth she saw the butt of a gun sticking out of a paper bag that also held some sandwiches . The men on Dunn 's list looked like all the other men in the exchanges . She studied them from varying distances , pretending to be looking at merchandise while doing so . Several times she permitted the operator of a booth to take out a tray of diamonds or watches and feigned interest in them . Just before taking a break for lunch she decided she would call Addabbo from inside one of the building lobbies . " Yes ? " He was obviously excited . " Mr. Addabbo ? This is Charity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Bay . Miss Bay ! " He was shouting . " I 've just had word that they 've held someone else up . I do n't know any details . I was just about to call Dunn . " " Where ? What 's the address ? What floor ? " " ' Twenty-one . Fifth floor . Room 508 . The name is . . . . " But she was running out of the lobby and dodging traffic to get to the other side . Twenty-one was just across the street . It was a small building , not more than seven or eight stories high , she guessed . Judging by the way the people stood waiting for the elevator in the lobby news of the robbery had not reached that far yet . She weaved through them to a door at the rear marked STAIRS . Several people turned to look as she yanked the door open and bounded up the stairs . The staircase was metal and with a landing between each floor . On each floor was a door with a number painted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some sort of alleyway . The windows were covered on the inside with a hinged wire grille held in place by a simple brass latch . When she reached the first floor landing and while still moving , she tore off her heavy coat and tossed it into the corner . On the fourth floor something caught her eye , and she came to an abrupt stop , panting heavily . The window grille was closed , but the window itself was opened a little at the bottom and the grime and dust on the sill had recently been disturbed . The heavy window opened hard , and it took most of her strength to get it up to her eye level . When it was open she stuck her head out , but before she could even see anything , someone grabbed her ,  | first by her neck and then by the scarf around it , choking her and pulling her up and out of the window at the same time . Fighting for breath and for an understanding of what was happening , her feet fumbled for toeholds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the solid brick wall no more than two inches wide . She was pulled four or five or maybe six feet along the ledge to what had once been a window but had been bricked over and now formed a slight indentation in the wall . Hugging the bricks for dear life , feeling frantically with her fingers for something to hold on to , she got a brief and desperate look at him . He was taller than she and he had a thin , pocked face . His hair and a horseshoe-shaped mustache were both shining black . She thought he was Latin , Puerto Rican probably . There was a hole scar on his right jaw that could have been made by a bullet . But the dominant feature of his face was his eyes , which had coal black corneas , purplish whites and seemed to be insane . He let go of her scarf then and as she took the first few deep breaths he began trying to push her off the ledge , punching her face , one blow landing on the left eye causing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the shin and ankle . What the hell 's he holding onto ? she thought . He grabbed the top of her shirt and tried to tug her off balance , but the shirt ripped all the way down its front and she saw the ripped part floating down . She tried dodging and fending off his blows as best she could with her left arm and elbow while still holding onto the bricks . When he tried kicking her again he lost his own grip and balance . For a moment he tried frantically to hold on , almost in a comical way , like the little animals in the movie cartoons , Bugs Bunny in midair over a canyon , twirling one arm madly for balance . When he saw he was n't going to be able to , he made a desperate leap for the roof on the other side of the alleyway , which was one floor below them and perhaps six or eight feet on the other side of the chasm . Out of the corner of her eye she saw him just manage to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precariously for a second or so . Then , gradually , with superhuman effort , he pulled himself up to where he was able to hook his elbow over the edge . He rested a moment and then slowly pulled himself up the rest of the way and onto the roof where he lay gasping for breath . Then ,  | without one glance at her , he got up , ran behind the roof house and disappeared from sight . She shivered from the cold and tried not to sneeze but did . Her fingers were both raw and numb at the same time and when she looked down to see what she was standing on she saw that somehow her skirt had gotten ripped , too  --  all the way to the waist so that she was practically naked . She also learned for the first time that she had lost her right shoe . She tried moving toward the window , but she did n't seem to be in sufficient control of her arms and legs , and the coordination that was needed for the effort seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself back under control . In her mind she quickly went over everything she knew about falling . If possible try to roll , absorb the shock of the fall . Then : It is better to break your arms or your legs rather than your neck or back . That was the sum total of her knowledge . She did n't want to fall . She did n't know how long she clung there . And she did n't really understand how she was able to cling at all . She hugged the cold brick , touched it with her face , rested her cheek against it , almost tenderly . Somewhere stretched out above her were her hands and on them were her fingers , which were numb and sore at the time . Presumably they were holding onto something , the space between the bricks if that was at all possible . She looked toward the window again , and her eyes played tricks and games with her . It seemed impossible to get to . Control yourself . She mumbled it out loud and realized then that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her there , too . Again she tried to move and again it was no good , the fingertips would n't obey the brain , would n't let go of what they were holding onto . She also realized then that she was losing her sense of direction  --  which was up and which was down ? She held on . She tried calling for help . She tried screaming , but her voice was weak and even if it had been normal , she knew it would n't have been able to carry above the noise coming from the street . Then she thought that she would give up , just let go and fall , at least it was a solution . But that made her mad because it seemed like the shattering of her self-discipline , a thing she had worked so hard to build , a thing that was precious to her , one of the things that she  | had liked most about herself , what she had always considered among her strongest points . That was enough to force whatever adrenaline she had left into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even made her a mite stronger , she thought . She yelled , " Damn ! Damn ! " into the cold air around her and at the cold brick wall , and even reached a mini-peak of euphoria for a moment before she began slipping back toward despair . No , she told herself . Fight ! But the momentum of despair continued obeying its own law of gravity , picked up a little speed , too , and she began to feel the strength slowly slip from her freezing , swollen , bruised , numb body . And she cried , tears , for the first time since . . . . It was then that the head stuck itself out of the window . It startled her , the sudden appearance of the head . It was a Jewish head , a Hasidic Jewish head , with a straggly beard and dangling earlocks and a long thin Jewish nose . On top of the bead was one of those black velour hats she had seen them wear on the street . She studied the face , the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a young face she decided , maybe twenty-five , maybe twenty-seven . It had blue-gray eyes , and very white taut skin that seemed to have never been exposed to the sun and very rarely to fresh air . It looked anemic , evanescent . And then her heart almost stopped when she thought that she might be imagining it . The blue-gray eyes stared at her and they seemed as frightened as she was . When they looked down from her face she realized they were looking at her exposed breasts and legs . The T and A syndrome , even here . But why does n't he do something ? she asked herself . Why does n't he help me ? " Help me , " she said weakly , barely moving her lips . " Please . " But he did n't move , just stared at her . " For Christ 's sake , " she said , stronger , angry now . " Help me . Stick out your hand . I ca n't hold on much longer . " Still he did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't understand English , there seemed no acknowledgment in his eyes . But what the hell did you have to understand English for to realize that she needed help ? " Please , " she begged . " Please help me . " " I ... I ... " he stuttered . " Wait . Wait , I will go get someone . " " No , " she screamed and it was very loud . Then , calmer , strug- gling to grasp what was happening , trying to understand it , to master it , she said softly , lovingly , using what she knew was feminine wile , forcing her poor , puffed , hurt lips to smile . " Please . Do n't go away . Just hold out your hand and then grab my wrist and I will grab yours . I think I can make it . " You 've got to be a goddamn Raquel Welch just to save your stinking life , she thought bitterly . But he continued to stare at her without making one move to help , at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fright , terror , and desperation in his eyes . She was slipping then and she knew it . This was the end , she thought , she did n't have the strength to hold on any longer , it was just not possible . She had used up everything she had . Then , suddenly , he moved . He leaned out of the window and stuck out his arm , just as she had told him to . He was closer than she had realized . Slowly , shakily , and with a great deal of precise effort she managed to lower her right arm and reach toward him . As she had instructed he grasped her wrist and inch by inch  --  cell by cell , it seemed  --  she moved toward him . When his arm was around her waist she let go of everything including , almost , her consciousness and collapsed , let him lift her limp body gently up and through the window . When they were inside he stumbled , and they both fell back into a heap . She lay there on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out from under her like a little animal and stared at her , first on his hands and knees and then on his feet , stepping back several paces . She looked up at him , examined him as best she could , fighting for consciousness , knitting her brow with effort , trying to understand . " Why did you hesitate ? " she finally asked , forming each word painfully . He did n't answer . " Back there , " she said , barely making a motion with her head . " Why did n't you want to help me ? " His voice was nasal and he had an accent . " Excuse me , please , " he said gently . " But we are not permitted to touch women . " And he held out his hands , palms up , as if that explained it . " Who said so ? " she asked . He looked around the little landing with surprise , as if the answer was obvious . " Why , God , " he said .  | Her eyes were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to muster the strength needed even to raise her head a little , so her eyes darted frantically from side to side until they alighted , and focused on " Roosevelt Hospital " stenciled on something white , a sheet of some kind or perhaps a curtain . There was some activity somewhere behind whatever it was , a hush of voices and soft rustling . Eventually several nurses emerged , the last one turning to look at her and to break into a blinding smile when she noticed that she was awake . " Ah , so you 're up ? " the nurse said in a lovely , sweet and soft Jamaican accent , bending over her . Though it hurt all the way to the inside of the dome of her skull , she did her best to return the beautiful smile . " My name is Roberta Flowers and you are in a recovery room of Roosevelt Hospital . There is nothing seriously wrong with you , we think , nothing that a little rest wo n't take care of . You were suffering from shock and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand ? We think you are all right . If you ca n't nod your head just blink your eyes . " She blinked and Roberta Flowers smiled her devastating smile again and said , " Good , " and touched her shoulder . Suddenly she felt weepy , she did n't know why , but she could have wept at the touch , though it was so light she barely felt it . But it was so reassuring and it made her feel so safe and comfortable , so warm and secure , and she closed her eyes again and must have dropped off to  | sleep because some time later she was barely conscious of her bed being wheeled down a corridor . There was a dim light burning somewhere in the room , but everywhere else it was dark , and she was alone when she awakened again . There was an intravenous needle stuck in her arm , attached to a tube , attached to a clear plastic bottle . She did n't feel pain as much as she felt exhausted , so very tired , tired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed . She had a very bad taste in her mouth , and she was conscious for the first time that the tips of her fingers pained and that each one had been bandaged individually . And her face was swollen . She slept again . This time she was awakened by someone touching her , and she opened her eyes and was looking at a young dark-haired woman close-up who was not wearing a nurse 's cap or uniform and who was listening to her heart through a stethoscope . The woman 's face remained noncommittal when she saw that Charity had opened her eyes . The name plate above her left breast said DOCTOR . " Does this hurt ? " she asked , gently pressing her rib cage . She started to answer but found that she had to clear her throat first . " Not really , " she finally said weakly . " Just a little sore . " She noticed for the first time that it was daytime . " Is your name Doctor ? " " Yes , " the doctor answered without looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doctor . " " Then you are Dr. Doctor ? " It seemed so funny , so exceedingly funny , that she had to smile , which made something hurt somewhere near her ear . " Yes , " she said , touching the bruises and feeling along the blade of the shin bone . " Would you please move your toes for me ? Good . I do n't think anything is broken , but you have suffered from shock . After a few days rest you should be all right . Did someone try to rape you ? " " No , I was trying to grab a thief . " Dr. Doctor looked at her with surprise . " Are you a policewoman ? I did n't realize that . Usually cops get all sorts of special attention . Are you a policewoman ? " " I 'm a private investigator . A clit . " And again she had to control herself to keep from dissolving into laughter .  | It took Dr. Doctor several seconds to understand , but when she got it she smiled a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her pocket and began running the handle down each of the soles of her feet . When she nodded her head Charity took it as a sign that she had responded favorably . Still holding the hammer the doctor suddenly stopped what she was doing and turned to look at her . " My mother lived in Budapest during the war , the Second World War . Her entire family had been taken to concentration camps by the Germans and were all eventually killed , mother , father , two brothers plus numerous aunts , uncles and cousins . But somehow she alone escaped . She was n't at home when the Germans came and so she escaped . She lived with her father 's partner 's family and worked in an office as a clerk . She was nineteen at the time . At night she would go out and try to pick up German soldiers and entice them into cellars , parks , anywhere so that they would be alone . She would try to get them drunk and then she killed them . Sometimes she had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived . I have heard that she killed ten of them though no one but she knows the correct number , and she wo n't say . She was n't a member of any organization , any underground , any partisan or guerrilla force . She did this all on her own , by herself . She did n't trust any of those organized groups . She told me that she felt , instinctively , that they were as bad as the Germans . She was n't a big strong girl . She was shy , thin , frail . She had wanted to be an artist . Today she 's an old woman , a widow , who lives alone on Riverside Drive and is afraid of muggers . If you saw her on the street you would n't be able to believe what she did as a girl of nineteen . She never talks about it . I heard from someone who knew her in Budapest . " Trudy Doctor smiled . " I thought you 'd be interested . I do n't tell the story to everyone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor looked at her face bruises again and the inside of her mouth , then carefully examined each eye . When she was finished Charity said , " I 'd like to leave here as soon as I can . I 'd be more comfortable at home . " " Do you live alone ? " " Yes . " " Well , in that case I 'd prefer that you stay here one more night . I 'll give you some pills to help you sleep . I 'd like you to eat as much  | as you can , here and when you leave . Lots of meat . You 'll feel much better tomorrow and you 'll be ready to go back to work on the day after New Year 's . I 'll look in on you in the morning and check you over again before you leave " Roberta Flowers came in while the doctor was speaking and when she finished she said , " There 's a policeman outside waiting to talk to you , Miss Bay . If you like I can send him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . And to the doctor : " Thank you . " The cop was in uniform . He introduced himself as Patrolman Paul Rubino and held his cap under his arm . He said Lieutenant Dunn had been to visit her , but she was unconscious at the time and had had to leave and that he apologized for that . Patrolman Rubino was either thoroughly professional or so used to seeing bruised and swollen faces that he did n't once stare or act as if there was anything the least bit unusual about her appearance . If she did n't mind , he was saying , he would like to ask her several questions and he took out from his hip pocket the ubiquitous black notebook . But before he began his questioning he told her that the man she had grappled with had stolen one partially finished diamond worth about $300 . He , the thief , was most likely not involved in the other crimes but was probably an addict mugger who had chosen a door at random , rushed in when it was opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She then told what had happened to her and gave Patrolman Rubino a description of the thief , which he wrote down in his notebook . When she was finished and he did n't have any more questions he flipped his notebook shut and said that either he or Lieutenant Dunn would show her photographs and composite drawings to see if any of them was of her attacker . When he was gone she swallowed two of the capsules Trudy Doctor had left for her and lay back to wait for them to take effect , which they did almost immediately . She awakened an unknown number of hours later when an aide brought in a tray of food which she ate ravenously even though she was n't quite sure what kind of food it was , some sort of meat and mashed potatoes , she vaguely guessed . In any case it was tasteless  | and mushy and not worth identifying and when she finished she lay back , closed her eyes and went back to sleep , again immediately . She awoke the following morning . After a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of bed and walk to the bathroom . Her legs were wobbly and she had to hold onto the bed and the back of a chair to get there . But she felt better because of it . She did n't look at her face in the mirror too carefully mostly because the face seemed to belong to someone else . Once back in bed , she stretched her arms as far back as they would go and remained that way until an aide brought in breakfast , soft-boiled eggs , toast and tea . The eggs and toast were tasteless , and cold , and the tea insipid and tepid , but again she ate ravenously , wiping up every bit of egg with a crust of toast , getting stain on her finger bandages . About ten  --  she guessed at the time  --  Dr. Doctor came in , examined her and said that she could leave . " But no New Year 's parties , " she warned , smiling , raising her finger . " Fortunately , I have n't been invited to any , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her a small envelope with capsules in it and told her to take two if she had any trouble sleeping . Before she left she touched the back of Charity 's hand and wished her good luck and a happy New Year . With a new pair of panty hose bought in the gift store in the lobby and a badly fitting sweater and slacks lent her by the hospital 's lost and found department , and with the help of a nurse 's aide , she got dressed . Despite her protestations the aide insisted that she ride in a wheelchair down to the accounting department where the only disagreeable part of her stay took place . The woman on duty , heavyset with gray hair and black-framed glasses , could n't seem to get it through her head that she did n't have any hospitalization insurance . She showed her various cards and forms to help make her meaning clear , speaking alternately slowly and extra distinctly just in case she might be hard of hearing , or retarded . Finally , she was able to explain that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or an American Express card . The woman chose the latter but examined it carefully and telephoned its number to some clearing apparatus before she was satisfied . The bill came to $267.89 , and when everything was signed and secured in a file the woman , in a motherly voice , suggested that she join the hospitalization plan at her place of business . She simply nodded .  | The nurse 's aide , who had been sitting on a bench nearby during the entire proceeding , insisted that she wheel her to the lobby , too . She did n't argue . She was weak , there was no disputing that . The effort required getting to the taxi waiting at the curb exhausted her . It had begun to snow and from the looks of things the snow would stick and accumulate . She asked the driver if he would please drive along Second or Third Avenue and stop at the first open food market he came to . They finally found one at Second and Eighty-fifth . The driver said he did n't mind waiting and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basket with steaks , salad , fruit , milk , canned tomatoes , and tomato paste , onions , garlic and chocolate cookies , trying to finish the shopping before her legs gave out from under her . She emerged from the market pushing the basket which contained two large paper sacks filled to the brim . The driver jumped out from behind the wheel and loaded the bags into the cab for her and returned the basket to the store . She gave him a ten-dollar tip when she paid the meter . He thanked her profusely and carried the two bags to the entrance where he handed them to Mr. Horvath . Horvath wished her a curt " Happy New Year , Miss Bay , " staring at her face as if trying to determine whether the bruises were the ones from the other night or new ones , and God knows what else . He placed the bags in the elevator for her . She was too weak to carry them when the elevator arrived at her floor , she first dragged them out , one at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then dragged them one at a time to her apartment door . Once they were inside and the door locked , without even taking off her coat she collapsed onto the couch and closed her eyes . Even though she did n't sleep , when she opened them again a few minutes later she felt less dizzy and somewhat stronger . She dropped the coat on the floor and went to the bathroom to examine her face . The swelling was way down and at least she looked like Charity Bay again . But the left cheek was still puffed , the area around the eye blackened and there were several broken blood vessels in the white . She touched the cheek gently with her bandaged fingers . It did n't hurt too badly . She dragged the bags into the kitchen and put away those things that might spoil , drank a glass of milk and ate several cookies . Then  | she dialed her answering service , awkwardly because of the bandaged fingers . " Happy New Year , Miss Bay , " Phil said cheerily . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Anything for me ? " " Nothing , Miss Bay , " he said after checking . " Not a single thing . Slow around the holidays , I guess . But the Times says business 'll pick up by late January . " She removed the bandages from her fingers while waiting for the tub to fill , and when it was full she eased her aching and sore body into the steaming water . The telephone rang while she was in the bath , but she ignored it . The bath made her feel better , seemed to draw some of the soreness and aches out of her bones . Good old hot water . As she lay there she carefully examined each and every bruise , cut and scratch . When the water started to cool she washed . When she stepped out she quickly dried herself and put on a pair of chic , purple , tight-fitting warm knitted wool slacks and a fire-red man 's flannel shirt she had never worn before . Then she pulled the blanket off the bed , dragged it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called at two-thirty , awakening her . First he solicitously asked how she felt and was she all right and did she need anything , then apologized profusely for not being able to wait around until she regained consciousness . She mumbled that it was all right , she understood . Then he said , " Now you know why we have doubts about women in police work , clit or no clit . " His tone had changed to stern . " Are n't cops ever beaten ? " she asked . " That 's different . " " Are n't policemen , dicks , ever killed ? " She was angry now . " Even the biggest , strongest , best-trained , most heavily armed , goddamned male policemen have been beaten , disarmed , killed , even with their own guns . " " It 's not the same thing . " His voice had risen , too . She was going to say more but decided against it . Then his tone softened and he said that he hoped she was n't foolish enough to go out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether I go out or not , she told herself . He sensed it because he laughed and said , " All right . Take care of yourself and I 'll be in touch on Tuesday . If there 's anything you need , call me . " He gave her his telephone number , which she did n't write down . " Happy New Year , " he said . " Happy New Year , " she answered dully , and they both hung up at the same time . Sylvan Addabbo awakened her about an hour later . He was calling from his son 's home in Connecticut . He said he was sorry that she had been hurt and asked how she felt . He was also solicitous , and he said he somehow felt responsible , but when she asked him why he could n't answer . Then he asked if she knew that the man she had grappled with was most likely not the one who had robbed and killed the others . She said she had been told that . He said he hoped that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Year . Before he hung up he advised her to get plenty of rest and said that he would call her again on Tuesday , however , if she needed him before that for any reason she could get in touch with him at his son 's house . He gave her the telephone number , which she did n't write down either . Her wine supply was an accumulation of gifts for small favors and accommodations . She kept it , helter-skelter , in an impossibly blind corner in the hall closet , an architectural fluke barely accessible to the human arm . The bottles were stacked in no particular order one on top of the other . Because light does n't bend that way one more or less had to accept what came up next . She groped around until she felt some half-bottles and finally came up with three whites , which was almost the equivalent of getting three lemons on a slot machine , two Meursaults and one Chablis . She opened one of the Meursaults and put the other two into the refrigerator . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tumbler and sipped it while she prepared dinner . She was not only starving but starving for something with taste to it . She minced two cloves of garlic and sprinkled it over one of the porter house steaks she had bought before setting it under the broiler . While the steak was doing she made a quick salad of lettuce and raw onion rings , covered it with her usual oil and vinegar dressing to which she  | added several dashes of Tabasco sauce . She started to whistle something , but her lips hurt so she said , " That smug son of a bitch , " out loud , meaning both Dunn and Addabbo . She ate hungrily , devouring the entire steak and salad and finishing the bottle of wine . When she had finished eating her mouth tingled and tasted of onion and garlic and she thought she might also be a little high from the wine . She dumped the dishes into the washer , put on a pair of baggy-assed flannel pajamas and without even rinsing her mouth she flopped into bed and slept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was awakened at midnight by the din and tooting of the parties . She opened one eye for a brief second , wished herself a silent happy 1973 , turned to her other side and went back to sleep . This time she had a dream . She dreamed that she was back on a Norwegian freighter she had once taken from Antwerp to New York . She had been one of four passengers and the voyage had taken ten days . She dreamed she was in the small wardroom with the captain , first mate , chief engineer and the three other passengers , all of whom were men . They were eating herring , steak tartar , raw onions and boiled potatoes , and drinking Norwegian beer . It all tasted so good , so very , very good , and they talked and laughed a great deal and the mate , who was young and blond , not goodlooking so much as craggy and rugged , was rubbing her knee with the palm of his hand and that felt good , too , and she kept trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could n't seem to find them . It was n't a bad dream , considering . She awakened early to a silent , lifeless New Year 's day . There were no alarm clocks , as there usually were , or early morning radios , or people talking in loud voices , or shouting , no flushing of water or the constant distant hum of the elevators . She sat on the edge of her bed for several seconds feeling slightly dizzy . But her legs felt stronger and the first thing she did was to go to the bathroom and try to brush the taste of garlic and onion from her teeth and tongue . She brushed vigorously but with only minor and temporary success . She squeezed three oranges and drank the juice with pleasure , fixed two four-minute eggs , which she liked with fresh-ground pepper and a tab of butter in them , toast , tea and , of course , chocolate cookies . She felt infinitely better after having eaten . From what she could see through her windows on the world ,  | she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dressed warmly , putting on ski pants and a quilted nylon parka , snow boots and a bright red wool hat , muffler and mittens combination . With the exception of an occasional car or taxi , and clanking snow plow , the streets were deserted . She walked as vigorously as she could manage , inhaling the clear icy air until her lungs began to pain . She walked aimlessly and without destination , leaving her footprints in virgin snow wherever possible . When she felt the first twinge of fatigue she hurried home , changed into the chic slacks and flannel shirt she had worn the day before , made tea , which she drank from a glass on the sofa , her feet curled up under her in an attempt to get them warm . Then she slept , maybe for an hour , maybe longer , hoping that she might bring back the dream of the night before . But she did n't dream . So when she got up and began busying herself with the spaghetti sauce , she consciously thought about the blond Norwegian first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cabin and he had told her that the company had a regulation against his making love in the passengers ' cabins . He also said that she was the first woman other than his wife since he had gotten married . She diced four large onions and minced three large cloves of garlic then sauteed them in olive oil , the garlic first , until the onions were translucent , then added a large can of whole Italian tomatoes and two small ones of tomato paste ; she rinsed out all three cans with bouillon which she added to the pot , then put in four bay leaves . After this had simmered for about an hour , during which time she stirred constantly , she added salt , ground black pepper , oregano , basil , a touch of dry mustard and several dashes of Tabasco , tasting it and then adding a little more of everything until it felt just right on the tip of her tongue . She let this simmer for another three-quarters of an hour , stirring every five minutes or so , then turned the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stove to age . She had a cheese and onion sandwich and a glass of milk for lunch , got into her pajamas again and back into her still unmade bed . She slept without interruption , or dreams , for four solid hours . When she awakened , and still in bed , she telephoned her parents .  | " Charity ? " Her mother 's voice sounded concerned . In the background she could hear her father : " Who is it , Mae ? Charity ? Is anything wrong ? For God 's sake , let me speak to her . " " Hush , Dan . Charity , is anything wrong ? " " No , Mother , nothing wrong . I just called to wish you and Daddy a happy New Year . " Her mother thought about that for a while . " But you never called to wish us a happy New Year before . " By then her father had wrested the telephone away . " Charity , listen to me , you can tell us anything you want to . Anything . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand by you . Are you hurt ? We 're strong , dear . We 've been through a lot . Just tell us . You want me to come down ? I can grab a bus and be there in the morning . " After convincing her parents that nothing was wrong , she found that she had nothing else to say . Her parents then told her about the presents they had received for Christmas and that there had been very little snow on Cape Cod so far and the weather had been rather nice . But when she hung up she told herself that she felt better . She fixed her dinner then . She took some pains and made it sort of formal , set out a linen napkin and place mat she happened to have , lit the emergency candle she kept in a drawer in case of a power failure and stuck it in yesterday 's Meursault bottle . She ate half of the remaining steak and made ziti for her sauce , a thick striated pasta which was particularly difficult to digest and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Chablis with the meal and it was delicious . When she finished she blew out the candle , poured the remainder of the precious sauce into a glass bowl and put it in the refrigerator . She cleared the table , loaded the dishwasher and belched her way into the living room where she watched the news on television while sipping tea and eating cookies . When she felt the food sufficiently on its way , she walked around the room as vigorously as she could for about fifteen minutes , then brushed her teeth thoroughly and went to bed . With the exception of the fact that she was vaguely conscious of the mass of pasta churning in her gut , she slept like a little girl . She did n't dream .  | She awakened Tuesday feeling good despite the fact that her fingertips were still somewhat raw and some of her bruises were sore to the touch . But most of the fatigue was gone . And though all of the swelling on her face had disappeared there was still a dark ring around her eye and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost as a ceremony and then dressed in a gray wool wraparound skirt with blue piping , a pale blue wool sweater with the elephant-type turtleneck she favored , and put on kneelength stockings over her panty hose . She tried brushing the onions and garlic from her mouth several times that morning but with little success . It was not even seven-thirty when she left her building . The sun was out and a brisk wind helped make the air seem very fresh . The four to six inches of snow that the radio had been screaming like a lunatic about all morning had been pushed into piles along the curbs . She spent a moment wondering whether she should go back for galoshes then decided against it . She hailed a cab on Second Avenue and told him to take her to Fifth and Fortyseventh Street . She felt good as she settled back in the seat , positive was the word . She would speak with Addabbo that morning about the possibilities of interrogating some of the people on Dunn 's list . She also wanted to speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps , they might be dismissing the man she had grappled with too easily . Maybe he had heard from someone else how easy it was to rip off the diamond district . It was a hunch . There was a traffic problem that morning . When the cabbie sought to turn onto Fifth Avenue at Fifty-fifth Street , a cop  | prevented it and waved him on . When they passed they could see fire trucks two streets down blocking the avenue . " Sorry , lady , " the cabbie said . " I 'll let you off at Forty-seventh and Seventh , if you do n't mind . Otherwise it will take me half an hour to get you any nearer . Besides , it 's a nice day for walking . " Forty-seventh between Seventh and Sixth avenues was blighted , a stretch of it occupied by ratty-looking hotels and sleazy restaurants and bars . Even at that hour of the morning , whores , both black and white , and their pimps , who were all black , preened themselves in the hotel lobbies and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street . Perhaps in the middle of the block was a small narrow bar with a painted green sign that said Henley 's . She just happened to glance in as she passed it . The bar was crowded , at about 8:2o A.M. , the first working day of the year , with black pimps and one white man who sat near the door and who stood out as if a spotlight was focused on him . He was wearing a yarmulke . She crossed the street to watch from the other side . Jews wearing little hats do n't drink in bars . She was not aware of anyone ever telling her that , or how she knew , maybe it was just general knowledge . At the very least she had never yet seen anyone wearing a yarmulke in any of the thousands of bars she had ever passed or sat in . He was sitting on a barstool , oblivious of the noise and animated confusion going on around him , hunched up into a gray overcoat , staring straight ahead of him as if in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bartender 's attention , holding up his shot glass to do so . As soon as it was filled he threw the contents back into his throat and clutched the glass in his hand until he was ready for another one . Everyone but the bartender ignored him , as if he were n't there . Now , she thought , if this particular yarmulke was in the diamond business . . . . She watched him take a bill out of his pocket and wave it . While the bartender made change he blew his nose in a large gray handkerchief and then wiped his forehead . When he stepped out of Henley 's he looked up and down the street once and then began walking briskly toward Sixth Avenue . Before be arrived at Sixth he crossed to her side of the street and  | she was able to get a good look at him . He was in his early forties , she guessed . There were rings around his eyes , black and puffed like miniature automobile tires . And the eyes themselves were bloodshot , maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sleep . She also noticed that he had n't shaved that morning and most likely he had n't shaved the day before either . The collar of his shirt was limp and the narrow green figured tie he wore hung lifeless from a small , mean-looking knot . Maybe he is in mourning , she thought as she followed him across Sixth Avenue when the light changed . It seemed to her that she had also heard somewhere that Jews mourn hard . Maybe one of his parents , or someone close , was dying . He turned into a building part of the way down Forty-seventh Street , Number 50 . She pretended to look at her face in the reflection of an empty window while he waited , alone , in the lobby for the elevator . It was barely eight-thirty and there were very few people on the street . When he disappeared into the elevator she walked in and watched the indicator above the door stop at seven . When the elevator returned she got in and went up to the seventh floor . The floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business and one dentist . The only door that showed light under it had JOEL KOENIG DIAMONDS printed across its face . The very first thing she did while descending in the elevator was to acknowledge to herself that it was pitifully little to go on .  | " This is Miss Ruth , " she said when the receiver was picked up . " Just a minute , Miss Ruth , " a voice garbled by an electronic sieve said . There was a pause while he checked the name Ruth . " Yes , Miss Ruth , " the voice said when it came back on the line , and hung up . She always felt foolish going through this security procedure that Schloat  --  his full name was Burton Schloat  --  insisted upon though she did believe his caution was fully warranted . Now she would wait exactly ten minutes and call another number . She passed the time looking up Joel Koenig in the telephone directories next to the booth . The one in the Manhattan book was his business address . There was no Joel Koenig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brooklyn , one Joel C. and two plain Joel Koenigs . She jotted down all three addresses and telephone numbers . There were no Joel Koenigs in either Queens or Staten Island . It was also possible that he had an unlisted number or that he lived somewhere in the suburbs , just as it was probable that there were even alcoholic religious Jews who drank their whiskey in bars all over the world , only she had never seen any . When the ten minutes were up she dialed the other number Schloat had given her which she guessed was that of a public telephone ten minutes away from his home . This time the receiver was picked up on the first ring . " You dialing from a booth ? " he asked before she could say anything .  | " Yes . I 'd like you to do a job on a Joel Koenig , Fifty West Fortyseventh Street , Manhattan . It 'll probably only be for a few days . I 'd like tapes of all calls and the transcribed numbers of the outgoing ones . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every business day . " " Can do , Miss Ruth , " he said and hung up . Schloat was good , the best listener she had ever used , and the most expensive . He was completely removed from any professional listening organization , with a cover as a real estate broker , so that the probability of his being known to the authorities was practically nil , which made him that much more valuable . It was n't that his equipment was better than anyone else 's , though he used the best ; he had once told her that he built all his own equipment so it could n't be traced . His uniqueness was in getting the tap on without anyone noticing it and removing it before it was discovered . He had said that he had a contact in the telephone company who warned him when a line he was working on was up for inspection or about to be visited by repairers or installers . She was aware that he might have been boasting . But he was very reliable , there were never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of tape . He was well worth the exorbitant fee she would mail , in cash , to his real estate office on Long Island . It was well after nine when she was finished with Schloat and she walked to Addabbo 's office which was on the seventeenth floor of the building on the corner of Fifth Avenue . It was closed . She waited in the hall until about nine-forty when a woman arrived , opened the doors and turned on the lights . Addabbo was a member of the firm Moss , Michaels , Rosen , and Addabbo . The impressive waiting room was all leather and chrome . She sat on a tufted leather bench until the woman came back and she told her who she was waiting for . " Oh , Miss Bay . Of course . I am Miss Priest " She said it as if they were old friends and she unashamedly looked her up and down , stopping briefly at the breasts and a little longer on her face , especially her eye . Miss Priest 's wide leather belt made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her hips . " Coffee ? " she asked cheerily . " No , thanks , but I 'd like to make a call . "  | " Of course . Help yourself . Use that one on the reception desk , I 'll plug it in for you . " Dunn was n't in yet either . The various secretaries and lawyers began straggling in , all examining her . It was the first day back to work after a holiday and they stopped and discussed what had happened to or in front of them during their brief absence from each other . Addabbo arrived at ten . He looked every inch a successful lawyer , hatless , gray formfitting overcoat with a handkerchief in the breast pocket , sleek tailor-made black suit . " Miss Bay , " he said , surprised when he saw her , setting down his attache case and taking off his suede gloves . " How are you ? Is everything all right ? Ugh . . . yes , yes , I think we had better go into my office . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guided her down the narrow corridor . His office was paneled in blond wood , the floor was covered with a modern wool rug , his desk was long and low and contained nothing but a monogrammed desk set and a photograph of his family . " Shall I tell Miss Priest to get us some coffee ? " he asked . " Or tea ? " he added , remembering . And just as if Miss Priest had been able to read his thoughts she stuck her immaculate head into the door and said , cheerily , " Coffee ? " Charity shook her head and Addabbo said no , to Miss Priest 's disappointment . When they had finally gone through the ritual of sitting down , without going into details she asked if he knew a Joel Koenig of 50 West Forty-seventh Street . " Miss Bay , " he said , " I thought you were ill . Have you been working over the holiday ? " She did n't explain , just ignored the question and again asked him about Koenig . " No , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street . But , of course , I can get information on him . Is this a break for us ? Is this man involved ? " " He may be , " she said with as much authority as she could muster , though it came out sounding mysterious , if not foolish . " Mr. Addabbo , if you would just , say , allow me to work on this particular angle without asking any questions I would appreciate it very  | much . I would also prefer that you do n't mention it to anyone , there are no hard facts to go on . " Dunn acted more or less the same way . " Charity , there 's got to be a reason why you want me to run a check on this man . You did n't pick the name out of the air . And I 've got to know . If there is reason to suspect him we should be in on it . I 've got to warn you about something you are well aware of , and that 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " A misdemeanor , " she said into the telephone . Both Dunn and Addabbo promised to have something on Koenig by midafternoon . She waited for an hour in a lobby across the street from Koenig 's office to see what he might do during his lunch break , if anything . He came out of the building at exactly twenty minutes after noon . He was alone and he looked exactly as he had that morning , as if he had n't even taken off his coat . He walked quickly in the direction of Fifth Avenue , entered a building , and she saw him go into a restaurant at the rear of the lobby . She waited on the cold sidewalk , checking once , peering in through the single glass door to see if he was talking with anyone . But he sat alone at the crowded counter , as he had sat at the bar that morning , huddled up in his overcoat , gulping down his food . When he left the restaurant he returned directly to his office , nodding once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking to him . She wondered why a man drinks first thing in the morning and then does n't touch a drop at noon . She had her lunch in a different restaurant , one almost directly across the street from Koenig 's building . She used the filthy washroom first , examined her face and eye in the tiny peeling mirror . The red specks in the white of the eye were getting smaller , she was certain of that . When she washed her hands her fingers tingled , and she realized that they had been smarting all morning but that she had just accommodated herself to the discomfort . She chose a counter stool from which she could best watch the building entrance across the street and ordered the boiled beef platter without any potatoes but with a salad . They brought potatoes anyway . The beef had a light off taste to it but the horseradish that came with it countered the taste and she asked the counterman to bring her another portion of it so that she might finish the beef . Koenig did n't  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , at least he did n't come out of the front entrance . Addabbo had some information when she went up to his office at about a quarter to three . Dunn was there . After she had turned down Miss Priest 's offer of coffee or tea Dunn read it to her . He was one of the two plain Joel Koenigs in the Brooklyn telephone book ; he lived on Ocean Parkway . Koenig 's credit rating was between fifty and sixty thousand dollars , small for someone in the jewelry business , Addabbo explained . He dealt exclusively in smaller stones , buying them from cutters and brokers , having them finished when necessary , and selling them to smaller jewelry stores all over the United States . It was estimated that he did about $600,000 worth of business a year . " Pretty small potatoes , " Addabbo said . " Maybe he takes home anywhere between fifteen or twenty thousand a year . That is , ugh , taxable income . It 's quite possible that he makes three or four times that amount in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I doubt it . I would have heard of him . " Koenig was also a member of the Diamond Club . Addabbo went into great detail about the diamond clubs and bourses in all of the major diamond cities in the world , London , Brussels , Amsterdam , Tel Aviv , New York . These were places where dealers gathered to buy , sell , or exchange diamonds . They were composed of large rooms with windows facing away from the sun , long benches with scales on them on which the men sat to examine diamonds and haggle about the price . Only members were permitted inside . Disputes between members were settled by a board of arbitrators whose decision was law . All members of these exchanges had to be of good character , or at least what passed for good character in the diamond community . And , very importantly , solvent . Membership in one club was recognized by all other clubs around the world . If a member went bankrupt or defaulted on a payment he was automatically excluded from every other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Koenig had never been indicted or convicted of any crime . Nor was there any record of his ever having had a driver 's license . She began watching the entrance to the building again a little after four . In about fifteen minutes she was sorry she had n't worn galoshes that morning , or at least warmer shoes , and she went into  | the lobby behind her and called her answering service . There was a message to contact a D. B. Cooper in Phoenix , Arizona . Cooper said he had learned about a lot of diamonds being offered for sale , not in Phoenix but somewhere else in Arizona , was that what she was interested in ? The diamonds were finished , and he guessed they had come from someone in the Los Angeles area . She asked if he could get a description of a few of the larger ones and he said he would try . At five o'clock the direction of the stream of people passing before her definitely shifted as the rush toward the subway began . Because it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street and watched from only a few feet away from Number 50 . By six both pedestrian and vehicular traffic had thinned to a bare trickle . At six forty-two she took the elevator up to the seventh floor . There was a light under Koenig 's door and she returned to the street to wait . He came out at around seven-fifteen . He walked quickly , and she followed him , down the subway entrance . She stood behind a pillar on the platform waiting to see what train he would board . He kept looking at his wristwatch , shooting the arm out of the coat sleeve every few seconds , holding the watch up in front of his eyes , touching it with the thumb and forefinger of his other hand . He was the only one on the platform wearing a yarmulke though no one seemed to take any particular notice of it . He let the first train that came into the platform pass and boarded the second , which , according to the sign on its side , was going to Queens . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doors between the trains so that she could watch him . She thought then that he was probably in his mid-to-late thirties rather than in his forties as she had guessed that morning . He still had n't shaved and the dark of his beard and the dullness of his clothes drained whatever color he might have had . His hair was beginning to thin in front , causing a sort of peninsula in the center , and it was a dark color really not black . He had a large strong nose and a square chin and she guessed that with a shave and the proper clothes he would have been a handsome man , an Abe Lincoln type . When the train emerged from the tunnel into Queens he began looking at the signs each time they reached a station . Once he took  | out his handkerchief and wiped his eyes and nose , and once he scratched the side of his neck for an inordinately long time , almost as if he had set his finger in motion and then forgot to turn it off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ station , just as the signs became distinguishable . She waited at the door of her car for him to step out and when he did she followed . He all but ran , weaving in and out of the other people walking toward the exit and she had to hustle to keep him in sight . There was more snow on the ground in Queens than there had been in Manhattan and the sidewalks were icy . Both she and Koenig slipped several times but it did n't affect his pace . She followed him for several blocks along Queens Boulevard , according to the signs , to a busy street lined with stores . He turned into the street and several doors down he entered a large cafeteria . The cafeteria was almost empty of customers and she decided against following him inside even though she was cold and would have very much liked to . She watched while he took a tray and utensils and walked along the counter choosing and finally paying for his food . When he chose a table she took up a position behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she might get a good look at the person he was meeting . He had bought a sandwich on a roll , and coffee , and he sat there with his coat unbuttoned , bolting it down , staring with unfocused eyes ahead of him . Every few minutes he looked at the big clock on the cafeteria wall . No one came to the table while he was eating . When he had finished he got up , went into the men 's room and came out a few seconds later , still fumbling with his fly . On the street again he headed for and turned onto Queens Boulevard and walked away from where they had emerged from the subway . She looked at her own watch and noticed that it was now eight fortyseven . She guessed then that he was heading for a house or apartment in the area because he stopped at each corner to read the street signs . But at the fourth block on Queens Boulevard he slowed down , and though it seemed ridiculous she was almost certain that he was counting lamp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , darker than the others because there were no stores on it , only the entrances to apartment  | buildings . There was a constant stream of traffic in both directions on the boulevard itself , which was very wide and was really made up of several roads , the central roadway for express traffic , the side roadways separated from it by narrow concrete strips , used for parking and local traffic . He stopped at the third lamp post on that block which had a fire hydrant several feet away from it and thus was free of a parked car . When he turned as if to count the lamp posts again , as if to make certain he had the correct one , she slipped into the shadow of an alleyway . There were very few people walking by and these few were in a hurry . When he glanced at his watch again , she noticed that it was several minutes after nine . He was looking at his watch continuously then , turning away from it only to look at every car that came up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She thought then that he was waiting to be picked up by someone in a car and she wondered how she was going to be able to follow , unless a taxi came along at just the right time . The least she would do , she told herself , was to jot down the license plate number . At ten minutes after nine he seemed to have reached some sort of crisis point , for he unbuttoned his coat as if he had suddenly become very warm . And he began walking up and down impatiently underneath the lamp post . For several minutes no cars passed him on the side road . Then it arrived . At first all she could see was that it was a large car , dark , probably black , most likely a Cadillac though not the latest model . It rounded the corner slowly then came down the road at a normal speed . It did n't have its headlights on and when it arrived at the zone of light broadcast by the streetlamp it seemed to slow a little . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearing a ski mask . At first she thought the driver was the only person in the car , but when it was opposite Koenig a little girl was suddenly thrust up to view in the rear window , held there by , it seemed , someone who also wore a ski mask . Koenig stopped his pacing and stood there as if he were unable to move . When the little girl saw him she began to wave her arms and you could see but not hear her scream . At that moment the car picked up speed and turned right at the corner . Because its exterior lights were out she was unable to see  | the license plate . Koenig ran after the car , running first in the street , and then up on the sidewalk , waving his arms , shouting , ignoring and almost knocking down a couple who were walking by and who had stopped to look at him . He also turned the corner and continued running after the car , which was now out of sight . When she got to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his face , run that way into an alleyway between two large apartment buildings and disappear into the darkness . She followed , adjusting her eyes quickly to the darkness , and when she came upon him a few feet further in he was slumped over a line of metal ash cans . He was crying , wailing at the top of his voice , beating his fist on the tops of the cans . " Baby ! My baby ! Baby ! God , God , God . " He was unaware of her and she stood there and watched him for a moment , moved by the pathetic way he was crying . Then she touched his shoulder . At first he did n't respond , did n't seem to feel her hand , and continued wailing , continued to beat the tops of the cans . But when she shook him he stopped , looked up at her and shrugged her hand off . " What the hell do you want ? Go away . Leave me alone . I 'm all right . Just go away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . " Maybe I can help you . " At the sound of his name he jumped angrily to his feet and peered through the darkness at her , trying to see her clearly . " How did you know my name ? What do you know about this ? " " I. . . . " she started to say , but before she could he had hit her with his fist on the side of her jaw , then grabbed her by the shoulders and threw her down hard against the line of ash cans . She landed with a clatter and he ran away . All the soreness and fatigue of the previous days came back then and she had to lie there for several cold minutes in order to get enough strength back to stand up . When she did she made no attempt to follow him .  | She took a cab to Ocean Parkway . When she gave the cabbie the address he turned around in his seat and whined , " Aw , lady , give me a break . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot . Look , I got a wife and kids . Why do n't you pick on one of those hippie drivers ? They 're all single . " But she leaned back on the seat and did n't answer . " Shit , " he said , turning to face the front again . Then , looking at her through the rearview mirror , he jammed his foot down angrily on the accelerator . " What the hell does someone like you know about making a living ? " It had been a bad morning all around . When she had finally , exhausted , reached her bed the night before she had set the alarm for six . But when it rang she shut it off , hardly aware that she was doing so . She had awakened with a start at nine-thirty , feeling guilty and achey and not at all rested . She jumped out of bed , had tea and cookies , dressed and , barely looking at herself in the mirror , rushed to Forty-seventh Street , and all but ran up to Koenig 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pounded on the door even though there was no light peeking from under it . And she had waited , first outside the office , then down in the lobby and had made some calls to her answering service . At eleven A.M. , she had decided to go to the address on Ocean Parkway . On the bridge to Brooklyn the cabbie 's anger waned . He looked up into the mirror and said , " I 'm sorry what I said before . I lost my head . That 's my big problem , my temper . That 's why I 'm a cabbie and I probably will remain a cabbie all of my life . "  | She nodded . " Ah , " he said warming to a big conversation , " . . . you from New York ? " She was surprised at how pretty Ocean Parkway was , even in the dead of winter . It was wide , very wide , lined with trees and there were wide separate horse , pedestrian and bicycle paths separating the lanes of traffic . The houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single ones built of brick . " Here it is , lady , " the cabbie said pulling up to the curb , turning around and smiling as if they had been on a cruise together . She tipped him well and the smile became too dazzling to contemplate . " You 're all right , honey , " he said . " Have a nice day . " She found J. Koenig 3E on the tenant roster in the front lobby and pressed the button next to it . She put her ear to the combination speaker and mouthpiece and waited for an answer . When she heard a click and a change from dead to live sound she said , " Hello ? Mr. Koenig ? Hello ? Hello ? " But there was another click and the sound went dead again . She pressed a button at random with the Number 6 next to it and a woman 's voice asked , " Who is it ? " " This is Mrs. Miller , " she said , picking a name from the console . " I forgot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There was a suspicious heavy breathing and finally the front door buzzed and she pushed it open . She climbed the stairs to the third floor rather than take the elevator . There was a smell of years and years of cooking in the hall . The terrazzo floor was worn in front of the elevator doors , but the hall itself was neat and clean and the walls had been recently scrubbed . The doors and frames were made of metal and painted brown . She rang the bell on the door of number 3E and stood on the mat staring at the peephole . She could hear it being opened from the inside but could n't see anyone . " Mr. Koenig ? " she asked . There was a pause and some scuffling of feet as if they were changing places behind the peephole and finally a woman 's voice said , " What do you want ? " " I 'd like to speak with Mr. Koenig . Are you Mrs. Koenig ? " Another pause , then the woman said , " Go away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do n't open the door to strangers . How did you get in here anyway ? The door downstairs is supposed to be locked . " " Mrs. Koenig , please , open up . It concerns your daughter . " It was as if she had spoken the magic word . Suddenly the door was pulled open and Joel Koenig stood there holding a huge Colt .45 automatic in his shaking hand . " Inside , " he ordered . " Come in quick , " and he motioned with the gun . When she put her foot on the threshold he grabbed her arm and pulled her in , then stuck his head out of the door , looking up and down the hall before he closed it . Mrs. Koenig , who had been hidden by the door , quickly snapped the locks and set the chain . " Get in there , " Koenig said , pushing her into a living room with raspberry-colored walls , several Scandinavian-type pieces of furniture and various abstract reproductions and prints on the walls . " Sit there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vinyl couch . She sat . Mrs. Koenig was petite , maybe five feet , no taller than five-one . She might have weighed one hundred pounds . Her hair badly needed re-blonding , there were several inches of dark roots showing . It was pulled back and tied behind her head . Her eyes were red-rimmed and runny and her small nose was almost the color of the walls . She was wearing a cotton shift with an abstract flower design on it and no belt . She had white ankle socks and incongruous black satin boudoir mules with little puffs on the insteps . In her hand was a handkerchief which she alternately squeezed , dabbed at her eyes and nose , then wrapped around her fingers . She looked , bewildered and frightened , from her husband to Charity and to the Colt .45 . " I 'm not carrying any weapon , " Charity said . " Do you mind if I take off my coat ? It 's hot in here . " When Koenig did n't answer she put down her purse and slipped out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You are from last night , " Koenig said , standing over her menacingly . He had shaved that morning and she had been right , he did look a little like an Abe Lincoln , only one with a yarmulke . He was now wearing plain framed glasses , which gave him a studi- ous air , a yellow shirt , shiny blue trousers and dirty sneakers which suggested that he might be athletic . " Yes , " she said . " I 'm the same one . " " Did they send you ? You have a message for us about Marion ? " " Mr. and Mrs. Koenig . My name is Charity Bay . I am a private investigator . I am working for a group of diamond dealers on West Forty-seventh Street to find out who killed and robbed three men , possibly four . I have identification in my purse . I have reason to believe that , somehow , you are involved in all of this , most likely against your will , though I am not at all certain . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the car go by with your daughter in it . Now I can help you . I know I can . But you 'll have to let me . You 'll have to trust me . " " You 're a liar , " Koenig shouted . " Quiet , Joel , " his wife hissed . " Remember the neighbors . " He continued in a normal voice . " She 's lying . Diamond people do n't hire investigators . I know . I 'm one . You were sent by them . She was sent by them . To test us . They said if we told anyone they would kill Marion . I 've done whatever they 've asked and now they send you to trick us . I 'm going to kill you . I do n't care what happens anymore . I 'm going to kill you . " " Joel , Joel , " his wife said , going over to him , taking the arm that held the gun . " No , Joel . Calm down . Sit . Please , Joel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cry and turned away . " Why do n't you go to the police ? " Charity asked . " They can help you. , , " No , " he said , suddenly becoming limp , sitting down in a chair . " No , not the police . No . They told me . They warned me , over and over again , every time I spoke with them that if I went to the police they would kill my baby . They will , I know they will . They say they are watching me night and day , and I know they are , I can see them all over . I feel them . Even now , in here , they may be watching . " And he looked around the room , his eyes wide and wild . " Only God can help us . Only He can , and I pray , I pray constantly , I .... " He broke down , dropped the hand that held the gun so that it hung limply from his hand and with his head on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sobs . " God . Oh , my God . Why ? Why me ? "  | But when she reached toward her purse , he suddenly stopped and brought the gun to bear on her . She stopped , held her hands suspended in midair . " I do n't have a gun in my bag , " she said . " Your wife can open it and look inside . I just want to show you my identification , my investigator 's license . " " What can you show me ? " he said , tears still in his eyes . " So they had a license printed for you , or something like that . It 's a trap . You 're a trap . Go away , leave us alone . Tell them that we have n't said anything to anyone . Tell them we will do whatever they say but please give us back our baby . They can do anything they want after they give us Marion back , we will forget the whole thing . We will move , leave here , go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but please , tell them not to hurt her , to give her back . We are so sick , so lonely . We feel so . . . so bad . " Again he dropped his head and sobbed defeatedly . She opened her purse , took out a calling card and , catching Mrs. Koenig 's eye , said , " This telephone on here is an answering service . I will write my home number on the back . If . . . . " She just managed to scribble it down . Mrs. Koenig got to her feet . She was shivering . Tears were streaming down her cheeks . She looked first at Charity then at her husband and back to Charity . " I 'll tell you , " she sobbed . " Joel , we 've got to tell someone . Joel . Joel , she looks like a nice person , not like what I pictured anyone of them to look like . Joel , I 've got to talk to someone . I ca n't keep it in any longer , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We need help . " " No , Lila . No , " he said , jumping to his feet , waving the gun around as if he were insane . " No . No , goddammit , no . You 're killing her . Do n't trust anyone . Everybody looks good . But looks lie . You ca n't trust anyone . " " They took her , " Mrs. Koenig said , ignoring her husband . " They took her , it 's been three weeks now . . . . " She broke down at that point and started to cry again . But she bit her quivering lips , dabbed at her eyes with the handkerchief and found enough composure to continue . " They took her while she was walking to school . In the morning . Then they called him at work . We do n't know who . We are going crazy , both of us . I barely leave the house now . They told him to go about his business as if nothing had hap- pened . I have cried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any more tears , but then I cry again . Somehow you are always able to find a few more tears . " You say why do n't we go to the police ? They told Joel that if we went to the police they would kill her . They say they know , they say they are watching us every minute . Joel says he sees them watching . He ca n't put his finger on them but he knows . They change faces , but the face is the same , somehow . . . oh , I do n't know . . . . I do n't know . . . it does n't make sense . But then does it make sense to take a baby , steal a baby ? How can anyone do such a thing ? If you are working for them , please , tell them how sick we are , how .... " " Stop it , " Koenig shouted , rushing over , putting a hand over his wife 's mouth . " Stop it . You 're killing her right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " She pulled his hand away . " My baby , " she cried , the whole of her frail body shaking . " What are you doing to my baby ? What is she eating ? She is not like other children , please listen . She does n't eat everything . I cut her steak into little pieces , cut off the fat and the veins . The only part of the chicken she likes is the breast , the white meat . How can they know that ? And where is she sleeping ? Who is changing her clothes ? She has no clothes with her , and she is so shy , so shy , she wo n't even get undressed in front of her daddy ... oh . . . please .... " " Mrs. Koenig , " Charity said softly , sympathetically . " What do they want from you ? Why are they keeping her ? " " No , " Koenig shouted , running to her now . " Enough ! Enough ! Go ! " He picked up her coat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the other and pulled her out of the room . When they reached the front door , he let her go and unlocked , then opened it . He shoved her out into the hall and threw her things after her , and slammed the door . " Go away , " he called out through the closed door . " Go the hell away from here . I 'll kill you . I swear I will . "  | She was unable to find a taxi so she had to return to Manhattan by subway , having to ask directions , changing trains twice and feeling utterly lost and alien during the entire trip . But it gave her an opportunity to think , to try to wade toward some decisions , however tentative . That the Koenigs and their kidnapped baby were involved in the thefts of diamonds and the killings she was certain . How she did n't know . That whoever was holding the little girl would kill her was a very great possibility , too great to do anything sloppy . Then there was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right away ? She was obligated to tell him by law , by professional and even moral ethics . And yet . . . and yet ... . When she climbed out of the subway station in mid-Manhattan she turned into the first telephone booth and dialed the answering service . Dunn had called , it was as if he were intuitive , goddammit . He wanted her to call back as soon as possible . Phil said he had sounded angry . A sergeant something or other picked up the telephone on the third ring and transferred the call as soon as she gave her name . " Where the hell have you been ? " Dunn snapped without even the usual amenities . She did n't answer . " All right , where the hell are you now ? " She told him . " You stay right there and I 'll pick you up in twenty minutes . Do n't move . " And he hung up before she could say a word . He was there in less than twenty minutes . His car pulled up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which she was waiting , and the rear door swung open even before the car stopped . She climbed in . " I do n't like mysteries , " she said as the car pulled away . Dunn was glaring at her . " Can you tell me what this is all about ? " " You 'll see , " he answered . " Where are we going ? " she demanded . She could snap with the best of them . " The morgue , " he said and turned away to look out of the window . They did n't exchange another word during the trip . The Medical Examiner 's Building in New York is blue . It is on East Thirtieth Street and First Avenue near the huge Bellevue Hospital complex . When they climbed the steps into the lobby someone in a dirty raincoat took a toothpick out of his mouth , pushed himself away from the wall and came up to them . Dunn introduced him as Detective Brandt from Homicide . He was about thirty and had acne scars . When they shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the word " homicide . " The lobby was quiet , hushed even . There was a mural and a Latin motto on the wall which you knew without being a scholar was some observation about death . The plants scattered around the lobby were plastic . Huddled together on a vinyl-covered bench in a small alcove in the wall was an entire Puerto Rican family all crying that said more about death than any Latin motto ever could . Dunn showed his badge to the guard , who then allowed the three of them into the elevator . Appropriately , they descended . Just before the doors opened she caught the gall of death at the back of her nose and throat and tried in vain not to inhale it any farther . The cellar corridor was surprisingly crowded and noisy , people in white coats , more bereaved families . Fortunately , she thought , the wheeled stretchers lining the corridor were all empty , but she looked closely at each one as they passed them . At an intersection in the corridor they were stopped by a guard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ badge again . When they arrived Dunn held the door for her and Detective Brandt . Dunn showed papers to a black morgue attendant in a white coat and shoes you had to see to believe . He checked the papers against three-by-five cards , then asked them to follow him .  | He led them through a pair of swinging doors to the famous stainless steel wall lined with refrigerator doors . He stopped at one , indicated that they should stand aside , then yanked it open , pulling out the slab tray with the corpse on it . She did n't know what she was waiting for , and she would have given almost anything not to have been there . When the slab was out the attendant gently lifted the blue shroud off the head , which was resting on a heavy wooden block . It was Harry Diamond . " You know him ? " Dunn asked angrily , staring at her , watching for her reaction . " Yes . " Detective Brandt reached inside his coat and came out with still another black notebook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes . " Brandt made his first note . " He was killed on Sunday , New Year 's eve . He was knifed by an expert , there was practically no bleeding externally and he died almost immediately . We have no suspects . As I told you , we did n't even know that he was in the city . When we questioned the people in his building the only visitor he had had in the two years he lived there was a woman . The description they gave is almost a perfect description of you . " He waited for her to say something but she did n't . " It 's a good thing he was n't a fugitive from justice or I 'd pick up your license like that . " And he snapped his fingers . " If he had been a fugitive , and I had known about it , you can be certain that I would have reported it to you first thing , " she answered flatly . " Is there anything you can tell us that might give us an idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think so , " she said . " He told me that someone was after him , but he did n't tell me that person 's name . Someone who lives in Paris . This person  --  I know that it was a man  --  felt that Harry had betrayed him . " Brandt was writing furiously now , more than the value of what she was saying warranted . " Betrayed him how ? " he asked suddenly , looking up from the notebook .  | " I do n't know . " " How did you know where to find him ? " Dunn asked . " I saw him on the street one day several months ago and I followed him home . I did n't talk to him . I did n't have any reason to then , but I feel it is always better to know more than you can use . I had met him several times in Europe , the first time while working on a case in Paris . I knew that he was involved in diamonds and I went up to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case in any way ? " " No . I 'm certain he was n't . " " So why did you go to see him ? " " Well , I was n't certain until I went to see him . But I asked him if anyone was offering uncut stones for sale . " " Were they ? " " He said he did n't know . He said he was in hiding and had n't had any contact with anyone since he arrived in New York . " Dunn looked at Brandt and Brandt said , " Anything else ? " " I asked him if he had any idea who might be involved in our killings and thefts . He said he did n't . He said it did n't sound like the work of any of the people he knew or had ever heard of . " " Go on . " " I asked him which were the best places for disposing of such a large amount of rough stones . He was n't helpful there either . " There was a pause . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while , cleared his throat and seemed fascinated by the drama that was taking place in front of him . Dunn looked to Brandt again and Brandt shook his head a little to indicate that he had nothing more to ask . " Is that all ? " Dunn asked . " No , there 's one more thing . " " And what 's that ? " " He wanted to make love to me . " She said it angrily , spit it out , looked at the three of them staring at her . She was angry at having to answer these stupid questions . She was angered by Dunn 's tone , and by Brandt 's tone and by the damn morgue attendant , and by the fact that they were standing over Harry Diamond 's lifeless head .  | Brandt opened his mouth and sucked in air , but the morgue attendant grinned . His day was complete . Anything he saw in the movies or on TV that night could only be anticlimactic . Dunn 's face hardened and the little cleft on his chin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been the cause of his getting killed ? " he asked bitterly . " How do you figure that ? " " You could have caused him to drop his guard , become less cautious . You got him all hot and bothered , any woman would have , and he probably went out to find someone . Someone who was looking for him spotted him , and that was it . " " Lieutenant , if you 're finished with me I 'd like to go . " " No , I 'm not finished with you . I want you back with me at the office . You 're going over the head shots of the guy who might have attacked you on Friday . And I want you to talk to the artist . There 's a remote possibility that he 's involved in this and I 'm going to cover every goddamn lead that comes up . " She was too tired to argue and she decided it would be best to cooperate . And passed the remainder of the afternoon looking at the stack of photographs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the face that she remembered from the composite machine . And all this while , in the back of her mind , was the little girl who had been kidnapped . There were at least twenty photographs that could have been of the man who had dragged her out onto the ledge . But none had his burning eyes . That was what she was going on . Several times the artist and some of the detectives made clever remarks , and when she ignored them they made crazy faces behind her back , like children in a schoolyard . Finally , almost in desperation , she nodded at a composite and said yes , that was what he had looked like . She was exhausted by then and frankly confused , and she sat down in the visitor 's chair in Dunn 's office , trying to look composed and in control of herself but without success . He looked up from a report or something he was writing in longhand and he understood , the perceptive bastard . " You look tired , dear , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before giving in . " Yes , I am. "  | " And hungry ? " He smiled . He had a dimple on the left side of his face , in addition to the one on his chin . " That , too . " " I 'd like to buy you dinner . " Again she studied him . He did have a nice face . " I 've got a better idea , " she said . " Let me make dinner for you . " He simply said , " That 'll be fine . Is there anything I can contribute ? " And that was nice . She barely shook her head . He held her shoulders for a moment while he helped her on with the coat and steered her down the stairs and out of the building with his arm gently at her back . His driver was waiting at the curb , but she said she would prefer taking a taxi so he dismissed him with a wave of the hand . They hailed a cab on Third Avenue and he must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the way to her building . Mr. Horvath examined Dunn unobtrusively as he handed her a plain envelope which she knew was a note from Schloat telling her that there had n't been any calls that day to and from the number she had assigned to him . " Nice apartment , " Dunn lied when she turned on the lights and was hanging the coats in the hall closet . She insisted he take off his jacket and gun , too . " Sort of emasculating me , are n't you ? " he said jokingly , when he should have kept his mouth shut , slipping the holster into his jacket pocket . She pointed to the closet where she stored her wine and said she thought there might be champagne there , and also to pick out something red . " How the hell am I going to see what 's in there ? " he asked when he found the architectural blunder . " Feel around , " she shouted back . " Champagne has this aluminum paper around the cork . And you 'll just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Is it important that we have red ? " he asked after a while . " Yes , " she answered . " I had white a couple of days ago . " And while she was in the bedroom changing her clothes he called out , " Do you know what you have in that mess back there ? It 's worth a fortune . "  | " Find the champagne ? " " Only Dom Perignon . " " I 'm sorry . " " What you talking about ? It does n't come any better . " " How about the red ? " " Musigny , Comte de Vogue , 1961 . " " Does it go well with spaghetti ? " " God ! " he answered . She put on a simple skirt and blouse and combed her hair in the bedroom mirror . The specks were almost completely gone from her eye . When she came out he was putting the . champagne in the freezer compartment and opening the bottle of red wine . He looked down at her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Love it , " he answered . She decided there was more than enough sauce for two and spent a very serious moment studying her arsenal of pastas , narrowing down to linguine and spaghettini and finally choosing the linguine . She put the sauce on to warm and then water for the linguine and quickly busied herself making a salad . In answer to her question he said , yes , he liked his dressing piquant , and she added two more dashes of Tabasco . She did n't ask if he liked raw onion slices , just added them . " I use the plastic cleaning bucket under the sink for a wine cooler , " she said . He found it and dumped all the ice cubes in it ; she had then turned the bottle of champagne until he thought it was cold enough . She was no judge of champagne , but it tasted good and she quickly gulped down the first glass . Dunn said that it was sensational , but a travesty drinking it out of tumblers . He said the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dozen champagne glasses . She felt a little high after the first glass and all her aches and pains and worries seemed to lose weight . He decided to make a toast for their second glass . " To love , " he said , holding the glass up . " To crime , " she said , feeling stupid the moment it was out of her mouth . He did n't answer . They clicked glasses and drank . She decided the sauce was too thin and she turned the heat up a little and stood there stirring so that it would n't stick to the bottom .  | Just before the water started to boil , she first added salt and then dumped a little olive oil into it . When it was boiling actively she put in the linguine , a little more than she knew was really necessary , just for insurance , and began to gently stir it with a long wooden fork . " Finish the champagne , " she called out cheerily . " I need the bottle for the candle . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not having wine glasses . When the sauce thickened somewhat she turned the fire low and began testing the linguine . When it was just the way she liked it she took it off the fire , ran some cold water into the pot to stop the cooking and dumped it into a colander . She put it back on the stove when it was drained and poured and mixed olive oil into it . She was glad she had remembered to warm the plates but sorry they had n't stopped for cheese . " Hope you do n't mind there 's no meat , " she said , serving . " I read that we Americans eat too much meat anyway . " " Do n't mind at all , " he said . He had tied the dish towel around his neck and looked funny . She was warm and giggly when he held out the chair for her and the first mouthful of linguine was like the first mouthful of heaven . He said he loved her spaghetti and that made her feel good , too . God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wine , though . He said they should be drinking chianti , or red ink even , but not Musigny , Comte de Vogue . She ignored him . She ate ravenously . He ate slowly . When he was finished he said he had had enough . Even though she did n't have a cubic ounce of room left inside she could n't resist finishing the insurance portion , squeezing the last bit of sauce out of the pot with a rubber spatula . He watched her with wonder . Afterward they both flopped onto the couch like turtles with their bellies to the sun . After a moment he said , " You ever been married ? " She shook her head . Then he went on to say that he had gotten married when he was twenty-one but had only lived with his wife for one month and it had taken almost seven years for him to get a divorce because she was very religious . " Want some tea ? " she asked . " Love some , " he answered .  | When she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't drink more than a mouthful of the tea . After the first sip he put his cup down , took hers and did the same . Then he kissed her . He tasted of onions and some of the herbs in the sauce . She slipped her arms up around his neck and returned the kiss . When she felt his hands on her she pushed him away and said , " Let 's go into the bedroom . " She was undressed and under the covers well before he even had his shoes off . His sides were nice , lean without any rolls of fat , handles . They reached a point where she felt that plugs had been removed from the bottoms of her feet and everything was draining out of her until all that was left was a warm mass of jell with waves of feeling that moved up her body to the top of her soul which seemed to lie somewhere among the roots of her hair . She guessed she fell asleep at one point because she faintly heard him asking something to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Later , much later , she watched him dress and when he stood there in his gartered stockings and shirt , the cuff links already in place , she wondered if he knew how vulnerable he looked without pants on . It was about then that the outside world began catching up with her . Poor little kid , she thought . Poor Harry Diamond . " Friends ? " he asked suddenly , coming over to the bed still without his trousers , leaning over to look at her . " Making love is the ultimate friendship , " she answered , thwacking one of his garters . She decided against telling him about the Koenigs.  | She cleaned up after Dunn left , put the dishes into the washer , took the garbage out , and swept around the table . It had been a good night for the stomach and soul , but the body now ached a little and the mind felt tired . She took a bath with the transistor radio ( sitting on the tub next to her ) playing a random station barely above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right then , at home , and tell him about the little girl . After the bath she lay in bed without being able to sleep , finally got up , put on a heavy , white knit cardigan sweater that was sizes too big for her and came to mid-thigh but was very warm and sat on the couch listening to the world around her settle down for the night , the far-off television set , someone talking and something breaking , the street traffic , the call of police and fire Klaxons . When she was in her teens all these sounds signified the magic of New York . So what had gone wrong ? And why do they steal little children ? And why is everyone shopping for the answers in Blooming-dale 's ? She thought about Marion Koenig  --  she did n't even know how old she was  --  and how badly she had wanted to grow up when she was a little girl . She remembered she used to play grown up inside of her even when she was playing little girl on the outside . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a choice , but you had to be grown up to really see the sham , the goddamn sham of it all . She fell asleep on the couch some time after midnight , awakened an hour or so later and went back to her bed . It still smelled a little of Dunn and she fell asleep .  | The next morning she thought she would surprise Koenig by waiting in the corridor in front of his office for him , but as she was walking up the street from Fifth Avenue at eight fifteen he came flying out of his building on the run , almost knocking down people who got in his way , pushing them aside with the flat of his hand . He stopped running at Sixth Avenue , but he continued walking west as fast as he could and she was just able to keep up with him . He had longer legs but , fortunately , he was wearing the yarmulke and it kept bobbing up above the heads of the other pedestrians on the street . When he reached the Municipal Parking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to be making certain it was the right place and dashed inside . She arrived just in time to see the doors of the packed elevator close . She ran over to the toll booth island where a woman with coiffed gray hair had just stopped to take a time-ticket from the machine . " Mind if I ride up with you ? " she asked , leaning down into the driver 's window . " Ca n't wait for that damned elevator . " " My privilege , " the woman said without hesitation . She noticed the New Jersey plates as she scooted around to the other side of the car . The car stunk of perfume and in the short period of time it took to loop up to the third deck the woman gabbed about the insanity of driving in New York , but that the trains were so awful and had she seen Johnny Carson on television the night before ? Koenig was on the third level , counting cars with his finger . She had to interrupt the woman to ask to be let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly , and ran back to a point where she could watch without being seen . She expected him to meet someone , but when he came to a certain car , a blue one , she could n't tell the make , he stopped and ran to the front . There was something , an envelope , a piece of paper , she could n't see , stuck under the windshield wiper and he grabbed it  --  it was an envelope  --  read the note inside , then stuffed it into his pocket and ran for the elevator doors , which had opened to let someone out . " Koenig , " she yelled , in vain .  | She ran all the way down the ramps to the street level , but when she arrived he was of course gone . She returned to the third ramp and looked over the blue car . It was a Pontiac something or other , and she took down the license plate number . She tried the doors and the trunk , but everything was locked . She peered inside but could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very lively imagination . There was a message for her to call Addabbo at the answering service but when she telephoned Miss Priest said Mr. Addabbo would be away all morning , that he had more information on Mr. Koenig , could she come up at around three that afternoon ? She returned to Koenig 's office . The door was locked and there was no light coming from under it . She knocked several times but there was no answer , and she tried telephoning from a booth across the street . Nothing . She spent the rest of that morning walking back and forth across the street from his building watching it . Koenig did n't return before , during or after the lunch hour and at two o'clock she went to the same luncheonette she had eaten in on Tuesday , sat on the same stool and ordered the stuffed cabbage . When it was put in front of her she saw at a glance that it was greasy , and cold , and she sent it back for an egg salad sandwich figuring how much could they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . After lunch , to use the word loosely , she tried Koenig 's number again , just on the chance that she had somehow missed him walking into his building , but there was still no answer . Then she dialed the apartment on Ocean Parkway . The telephone was picked up before the first ring was completed . " Mrs. Koenig , " she said . " This is Charity Bay ... . " Whoever had picked up the telephone dropped it back onto its cradle . Addabbo was n't at his office when she arrived at three . Miss Priest came out to the reception room to get her carrying a stenographer 's notebook and a pencil in a studiously businesslike way , wearing shoes that were modeled after the kind deep-sea divers wear . She tilted her immaculate head to one side and pursed a smile and said , " Oh , Miss Bay , I 'm so very sorry he has n't come in  | yet . Why do n't you wait in his office , you 'll be more comfortable there . He should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the office she refused Miss Priest 's offer of coffee or tea which seemed to wound Miss Priest a great deal . She excused herself and said she had to go back to work . Before she sat down she took a large paper clip from the monogrammed desk set , straightened part of it and , after a little difficulty , managed to open the desk drawer . The only thing inside was a checkbook , which she did n't touch and some blank stationery with his name on it . She locked it again and dropped the clip into her purse . Addabbo came in with a rush ten minutes later , his cheeks red . Miss Priest came rushing in behind him , helped him take off his coat and whisked it and his gloves away . " Coffee ? " she asked hopefully just before she closed the door behind her . " No , thanks , Euncie , " he answered quickly . " Miss Bay , " he said , turning to her , briskly rubbing his hands before shaking hers . His wavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm so sorry that I had to be late . I was with a few of my clients . They are screaming , climbing up the wall and screaming . I had to tell them that we are just on the verge of grabbing someone . I hope that 's true . Even when things are good these people cry . When there 's even the slightest bit of trouble they run around bleeding . " He lifted his attache case to his desk , opened it with a key and took out a brown envelope . " I 've got more on this Koenig , Joel Koenig ? " She nodded . " It was n't easy getting . These diamond people are like clams , even with me . Anyway , the business used to belong to his father-inlaw , a man named Morris Gelb , who died about four years ago . When Koenig married his daughter the old man took him in as a partner . He taught Koenig the business and then began retiring a little bit at a time , coming in only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you see how most of the old people in this city rot away it was a nice way to go . That 's the other side of the diamond business . It 's mostly a family affair and accommodates everyone .  | The reason you see so many Hasidic Jews around here is that they bring the members of their particular sect in . The rabbi says to one of them , so-and-so needs a job , take him in . And he takes him in , even if he really does n't need him , teaches him the business , and that 's the way it goes . Think about it , not bad , right ? You got to give credit where credit 's due , am I right ? " Anyway , back to Koenig . His business is small , very small . He specializes in smaller stones . Large diamonds are becoming more and more rare every year , and there are n't that many around so only a few people handle them . Koenig does n't have access to the Diamond Trading Company so he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with excess inventory . His diamonds are less than a carat . It 's a different business altogether . The diamonds are known as melee and the rough are graded by sieve . When they refer to them , instead of giving their exact weight , as they do with large stones , they say there are so many to the carat . They are even finished differently , the very , very small ones , the chips , sometimes they are called dandruff flakes , are done in India where the labor is very cheap . " But we do n't have to go into all of that , I just thought you would be interested . Koenig buys stones , if they 're rough he gives them to someone to finish for him , and then sells them to small jewelers all over the country . I gave you his credit rating yesterday , about fifty thousand dollars , very , very small . " All right , where was I ? Yes . He was born in Brooklyn . He attended City College studying business administration . Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncle who owned apartment houses in the Bronx and Brooklyn , as an agent , which I guess means that he collected rents , answered complaints , dealt with the city , so on and so forth . He was drafted into the Army during the Korean War . He was born July 1o , 1932 . He was in the sixth division , engineers , and spent about a year in France . Let 's see , his wife 's name is Lila , he has a daughter named Marion who is now a ... a little over seven years old . Mrs. Koenig was an elementary school teacher before her marriage and she continued to work until the time she gave birth . She is a graduate of Hunter College . That 's about it . Not bad considering that I was able to get it in one day , eh ? "  | She nodded and gave him a smile for a reward . " Now , " he said . " Is he , is Koenig involved in this ? " " I think so . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But he is involved . " " So let 's get him picked up . Dunn 'll take care of it " " There are complications , " she said . " Complications ? What kind of complications ? " " I ca n't say right now . It 's a very delicate situation . I 'd prefer to wait , maybe a day , maybe a little bit longer . You 'll have to trust me . And you 'll have to promise me not to mention any of this to Lieutenant Dunn . " " Look , " he said , getting out of his chair and coming to stand in front of her . " If it 's Dunn you 're worried about , do n't . We own him . He 's ours . " " You own him ? " she asked . Addabbo stood to his full height and he hardened somewhat . Even his manner of speech changed . " Look , Dunn 's our contact with the police . Every business association in New York , whether it 's formal or informal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The hotel association , the real estate people , the bankers , Wall Street , the garment center . . . . There 's always one person special that they can call when they want something done , something in a hurry . There 's nothing wrong with it , it 's just good management procedure . We are all of us big taxpayers , we 're the ones who keep the city going , who make it what it is . Without business there 'd still be swamps all along the Hudson River . " " You bribe Dunn ? " she asked . " You give him money ? " " How about a drink ? " he answered . " It 's after four , I 'm not going to do anything more today . And you look like you can use one . She nodded . " I 'd like some sweet vermouth , if you have it . " Addabbo pressed a button on his telephone and Miss Priest came rushing in . " Honey , make me a martini and get a sweet vermouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Priest said sprightly . She touched a spot on the paneled wall , and it folded back to show a small bar that included a refrigerator and a sink . Neither Charity nor Addabbo said any- thing while Miss Priest efficiently and expertly pried ice from a tray , poured the martini mixture into a shaker , stirred it , tasted it cutely with her pinky , looking at both of them as she did so , naughtily , rolling her eyes . When the drinks were made she served them and walked efficiently out , stopping at the door to say , " Just call if you want any more , " again naughtily . " Good girl , " Addabbo told her . " Where were we ? " he asked , sipping his drink , crossing his legs , leaning back comfortably . " You were about to tell me if you give bribes to Lieutenant Dunn . " " He fished for the olive in his drink and popped it into his mouth . " Bribe ? That 's a miserable word . What can I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dunn collects coins ? " The " I think " she guessed was to tell her he knew she had been to bed with Dunn . She nodded . " Every year , at a different time of the year , a person not even remotely connected with us , me personally or the diamond business , either buys or sells Dunn a coin . If he sells it to him it is , let us say , seven to ten thousand dollars less than its true market value . If he buys the coin he pays Dunn about the same amount more than the thing is really worth . Simple , right ? The figures are not the real ones , I just used them to give you an example . " She smiled . " I 'll admit , " he went on , " that it is n't exactly clever or original . But it 's neat , and pretty secure . And it 's done all over the city , I can assure you that . You ca n't do business here unless you do it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between you and your client . If you ever repeat it I can and will break you . " " How did you happen to get involved in the diamond business ? " she asked . " What 's a goy doing running a Jewish world ? " He sipped his drink again and smiled and reverted to his old self again . " It 's a crazy story , " he said . " It 's hard even for me to believe . I enlisted in the Army the day after I got out of law school , early 1942 . I 'm sorry , I got to go back that far . I was sent to Officer Candidate School and came out three months later an infantry lieutenant . I was young , strong , idealistic , all of those things , believe it or  | not . Well , anyway , the outfit I was in fought its way through Belgium and Germany and eventually helped liberate the BergenBelsen concentration camp . " I was lucky . My unit arrived the second day . They told us the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I can only imagine how bad they must have been because the ones we saw were impossible to believe . The whole thing made me sick . I could n't believe what I was seeing . I do n't think I ate anything for two or three days and I could n't sleep for more than half an hour at a time . " It had a very strange effect on me . I was brought up a Catholic . Both my parents were good Catholics and I myself had been an altar boy and at one time I even thought I might go into the priesthood . But when I went to college I lost all of it . My generation did n't believe in God and I felt sort of foolish going to church , so . . . . Besides , it meant staying away from women and I found that almost impossible to do . " He laughed and winked at her and sipped his drink . " Well , when I experienced Belsen I suddenly realized that God existed because there was such a strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God . This was why we need Jesus Christ . Man is evil , just look . Christ will save the world . And I became religious all over again . " My outfit went on , but I pulled strings and remained behind at Bergen-Belsen to help rehabilitate the survivors , help bring them back to life again . By the time the war in Europe was over I was working at an Army-run refugee camp near Frankfurt . We were dealing with civilian relief agencies and some of them were only slightly less brutal than the Nazis had been , or so it seemed to me . The red tape , the prejudices of the various officials , the prima donnas , it was enough to turn your stomach . So when the time came I took my discharge in Frankfurt and remained there on my own , with my own money , of course scrounging from the Army , using my contacts for a place to live , and for food , and so forth , and helped the refugees on my own . There was no red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prejudice . But I got them where they wanted to go , where they felt they might fit , even if I thought it was the wrong place , without paying any attention to quotas , to official de- nials . I helped smuggle them into Palestine , wherever they wanted to go . It was a good year . Of course , I was limited to what I could do and I was only one person , but each and every person I helped got individual treatment and , let 's be frank about it , Christian love . I stayed there until I ran out of money and I could n't get any more . I even had to scrounge a ride back to the states in a troopship . But it was the best year in my life . " When I returned to New York I was faced with reality again . I had to make a living . So I opened up a law office , and starved . I was living with my parents then , borrowing money from them and a married sister , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , literally . And I reached a point where I was going to have to give up the law because I just could n't make it . I began looking for a job , as a salesman , anything . I just could n't continue to take any more from my family . They did n't have any more to give me . " Then one day , two years after I had returned from Europe , a man I had helped in Belsen , a Dutch Jew , wrote to me . Somehow he had found my address . He said he had been able to rehabilitate his diamond business to a point almost where it had been before the Nazis came to Amsterdam . Now he wanted to open a branch office in New York . Would I do it for him ? I did and that 's how it began . He referred other diamond people he knew in Europe to me and I handled their business here in New York . " Of course , from that point on I had it made . These were some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world . It has been very lucrative for me , you 've been to my home . And look at this office . Even though the sign outside might suggest something else , for various reasons that we wo n't go into , I am the senior partner , the big cheese here . I have the biggest slice of this pie , the others are just names on the wall . They 're there so that if anything happens to me there will be a continuity for my clients . " He leaned back , proud of himself , and satisfied with himself . He drank the rest of the martini , then looked at his watch . " Hey , it 's time to go . Miss Bay , why do n't you have dinner with me tonight ? " " Thanks , " she said getting up , straightening her skirt . " I 've got an appointment . " " Then we 'll make it some other time . " " Of course , " she said . And smiled .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
