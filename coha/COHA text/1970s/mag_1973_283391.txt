DOWN AMONG THE WOMEN <P> by FAY WELDON 216 pages . St. Martin 's Press . $6.50 . <P> <P> As Lit. 73 lecturers like Tom Wolfe keep saying , any number of mod subjects are better served by the New Journalism than by that creaky old party , the novel . But the condition of women does not happen to be one of them . <P> Even readers who agree with the parajournalists of Women 's Liberation are often embarrassed to find their positions taken with so much self-pity and self-righteousness , with such bloated excesses of tractarian rhetoric . In stark contrast stand the lean , sharp novels of British writers like Edna O'Brien and Margaret Drabble , and American fictionists like Joan Didion . <P> To those names must now be added ( on the British roll call ) Fay Weidon , novelist , playwright , and not incidentally mother of three . In her brief , brilliant , occasionally comic second novel she has squeezed two decades and three generations of Englishwomen into a corner far too tight for good manners . <P> Feminist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the narrative begins in 1950 . She is " a large , heavy-boned , unpretty woman with a weathered skin , and eyes too deep and close together for their owner to be taken as anything other than troublesome . " A 1930s-style feminist - and ex-Communist who left her artist-husband when he began to go commercial-Wanda virtuously teaches her daughter the credo of what used to be quaintly called " free love . " <P> Scarlet serves Mother Wanda right by disobeying with stubborn chastity , then becoming pregnant the night she loses her virginity . With her friends , she constitutes a kind of neither-nor generation . Rebellious against their parents , rebellious against their children , they are rebellious , above all , against the men they off-and-on love , and yet they still seem unable to organize their lives without them . Weldon men are talkers rather than doers . The aesthetes end up in ad agencies , the back-to-nature idealists wind up turning a profit on battery-stimulated hens . Seldom , if ever , do they make decent lovers . <P> " Men ! " Wanda cries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . " But men , finally , are not the enemy . Mrs. Weldon can even pity them . " Man seems not so much wicked as frail , " she writes , " unable to face pain , trouble and growing old . " What she can not forgive is nature . " A good woman , " she concludes with supreme bitterness , " knows that nature is her enemy . Look at what it does to her . " Down Among the Women is a passionate diatribe against the cruel specialities of female mortality , against a " terrible world , where chaos is the norm , life a casual exception to death " - and the listing goes on - " where the body is something mysterious in its workings , which swells , bleeds , and bursts at random . "
