THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Coynrnent AT this month 's meeting of the Tri-State Transportation Commission , people who live near airports were offered new hope through " a novel method of minimizing aircraft noises . " According to the Times : J. Douglas Carroll , Jr. , the commission 's executive director , reported that preliminary findings by acoustical experts showed that a low-level background hum inside a home allowed occupants to " operate more smoothly . " Insertion of such domestic background noises , he added , tended to improve the adaptability of people to aircraft noise as effectisely as soundproofing buildings to keep out aviation noise . Possible sources of " masking " outside aircraft noise , he suggested , could be the steady hum of an air-conditioner , a dishwasher or a radiator . The Times did not report a buzz of elation at Mr. Carroll 's report , but that could have been masked by the hum of passing motorcycles . Surely his revolutionary approach to environmental problems deserves the study of all thoughtful people Might not water-supply officials consider introducing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chlorine ? How about maternity hospitals ' packing newborn babies three or four to a crib so they will operate more smoothly in the world in which they will grow up ? Why not ease the standards of color-TV-set production to help us accommodate to new levels of radiation ? Could n't the Joint Chiefs base their strategic plans on the theory that a continuum of small wars will ease the shock of transition to the unthinkable ? There is food for thought here , and it should be taken with plenty of additives . Forward/ jiELF on looking down the road . We bring you 1970 tidings of lamps and furnishings for where you hang your hat- - from the New York Lamp and Home Furnishings Show , held last week at the Stader Hilton .

" we asked . " Contemporary-minded people , " said Marc . " These sculptures are replacing pictures on the wall . People who might have bought an inexpensive oil painting in the past now want this . Of course , they 've got to hang them high enough and strong enough so that the kids do n't get impaled on them . " " Where does the metal come from ? " we asked .

" Early American nuts , " Mr. Sager said . " I ca n't help it if that 's the taste of the American public . I just sell this stuff . We 're having a resurgence of Early Americana . It 's growing and growing . 1 , Vait till the two-hundredth anniversary of July 4 , 1776 ! This is just the start ! " We moved on . The Lamplighter , of Philadelphia , had a nice little lamp inside an arrangement of strings hanging from a kind of fountain .

The lamp over here lights up . And under the lamp is the stereo . It retails for twelve hundred dollars . You might say it 's a conversation piece . " " Who wants it ? " we asked . " Everybody . And we 've got a polyurethane fountain that actually works . And a wooden piano  --  a honky-tonk piano  --  with an eight-track stereo that actually plays . Only seventeen hundred dollars retail .

An hour after he made his intention known to Western Union , he received a telephone call from the local office saying that the telegram could not he sent , because nobody in Sheffield could sing " Happy Birthday . " Aid to the Defeated AFTER Biafra 's capitulation to the Nigerian federal government last week , the various private organizations that had been sending food and medical supplies to the Biafrans found themselves in an anomalous position , and in the light of the change many of the professionals and volunteers working for those organizations seemed a bit dazed . Besides the collapse of Biafra as a political entity , which left the groups without official contacts in the area , they found their future conduct complicated b the Nigerian government 's attitude toward them . Immediately after the capitulation , Major General Yakuhu Gowon , Nigeria 's head of state , condemned certain of the for- eign relief agencies principally Joint Church Aid , Caritas , Canairelief , the Nordic Red Cross , and the French Red Cross  --  for having prolonged the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from these agencies , and also from any country that had been " studiously hostile " toward Nigeria , General Gowon said , " Let them keep their blood money . " Some of the affected agencies turned to the United States government in their search for a way to help , but again they were blocked , for this country 's stated policj , involves a willingness to trust the Nigerian government to behave well toward the former rebels , and to accept the proposition  --  disputed by most of the agencies  --  that Nigeria will be able to provide fond and medical supplies fast enough to prevent millions of people from dying of starvation . Tuesday evening of last week , we dropped by the offices of the American Committee to Keep Biafra Alive , which occupies two small storefronts on East Seventy-sixth Street . The Committee was founded in July , 1968 , and has worked since then mainly to disseminate information about the Nigerian war and to achieve political recognition for Biafra . Dashikis , pieces of colorful fabric , wood carvings , and other native items @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had served as a shop , and in the other a dozen people were sitting at desks and tables making phone calls or doing paperwork . In the rear of the place , two people were operating a mimeograph machine . The atmosphere was tense but subdued . At one desk , a young man was saying into a telephone , " I guess you 've heard the news about Biafra . Look , we 're very much afraid  --  and so are the Biafrans we 're in touch with  --  that there are going to he widespread massacres , and we 're phoning people we know to ask them to send telegrams to Nixon asking him to send not only relief but also observer teams . These are the two most important things  --  food and observers . Not next Sunday , not next Friday , but now . " The Committee 's president , Paul Connett , a yiiing Englishman wearing a Cornell sweatshirt , was standing near the mimeograph machine talking with a slender young man named Cliff Cation , who acts as the group 's office manager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asking , " Would you drop in as an unarmed witness if the Nigerians said , ' No , you ca n't bring any food in ' ? " Mr. Catton said , " Yes . " " You would ? " Mr. Connett said . " You would go in a plane over Nigeria , right now , and drop down ? " A girl who was standing nearby gave a sudden nervous laugh , and Mr. Canon said , " Yes . " As an unarmed witness ? " Mr. Connett continued . " Knowing that you had a ninety-per-cent chance of being killed ? " Mr. Catton said softly , " Yes , I would . " He walked to the mimeograph machine and began to feed some paper into it . The front door opened , and a boy of about thirteen , wearing a blue parka , hurried in . Addressing everyone in the room , he said breathlessly , " The Mayor 's going to send a telegram to Nixon , and so are the City Comptroller and the President of the City Council . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ K. Lowenstein , too . " " What about Governor Rockefeller ? " a gray-haired woman asked . " Shall I go call Rockefeller ? I 'll go call Rockefeller , " the boy said , and he hurried out again . " In all the telephone calls that I 've been making , asking people to send telegrams , I have n't had a single negative reaction , " the gray-haired woman told us . " This has cut across al political lines . It 's not a rightist or a leftist kind of problem . It 's a human problem . " A few minutes later , the boy came hack in and announced , " I got Rockefeller 's office . They said he 'll send a telegram . " He looked around the room and added , anachronistically , " By the way , we 've got Liberal Party support . They 're for Biafra . " The next day , we called on James MacCracken , a vice-president of Joint Church Aid U.S.A. , in his office at the Interchurch Center , at 120th Street and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ composed of the American Jewish Committee , Catholic Relief Services , and Church World Service , had carried out the delivery of almost all the shipments of food and medical supplies to Biafra during the war period , using a variety of secondhand planes based on the island of Silo Tome and flying into Biafra at night , usually landing at Uli airstrip , north of Owerri . Mr. MacCracken told us , " The flights were going into an ostensible country called Biafra , and now there is no ostensible country called Biafra . And there is no more Uli airstrip . So there is no more air bridge . My worry is simple : The level of starvation of the people of Biafra at the time of surrender was so extreme that there are literally hundreds of thousands of people whose physical systems can not take  --  along with the emotional shock  --  a deprivation of basic food intake . And the food I do n't give a damn if it exists in the port of Apapa , next to Lagos . It does n't exist in their dishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he looked out at the Hudson River , which was covered with sheets of ice , and said , " Nothing . " The following morning , we stopped in at Catholic Relief Services , in the Empire State Building , and talked with Rocco Sacci , its director of public information . " We have not ceased our operations , and we will not cease our operations , " Mr. Sacci said . " We have been working with the Nigerian Red Cross and with the National Rehabilitation Commission , and so forth , and this is how we now plan to reach the people in the war-affected areas . So it 's not a case of voluntary relief 's being stopped from getting to the stricken area  --  that 's not the case at all . The problem is how soon it will get there . Joint Church Aid has appealed to the Nigerian government , because the supplies are there , the facilities are there , the pilots know the terrain , and we still have missionary priests inside . Joint Church Aid representatives are meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look very , very negative right now , but , nonetheless , until the Geneva meetings break up , Joint Church Aid has n't given up completely . " Late Friday afternoon , we spoke with Rabbi Marc H. Tanenbaum , a founder of the American Jewish Emergency Effort for Nigerian-Biafran Relief . Since its formation , in the summer of 1968 , the agency has been collecting funds for supplies , which it has channelled through UNICEF and groups affiliated with Joint Church Aid U.S.A. Rabbi Tanenbaum told us that he feared that press reports from Lagos might not reflect the actual situation in Biafran territory . " I talked to a relief person who came out of Biafra on Sunday , " he said . " According to this man , a hundred thousand people are hiding in the bush who need aid desperately and will probably die or be permanently maimed if they do n't get it within a few days . Joint Church Aid telegraphed General Gowon , offering to make available transportation equipment and twenty thousand tons of food that is stockpiled on Sao Tome . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the battle area  --  an accusation that is both ridiculous and tragic  --  and we have n't received an answer . " At the headquarters of the Biafra Relief Services Foundation , a large room in the basement of 777 United Nations Plaza , we found nine young people working at desks , mailing out appeals for funds or making phone calls . Near the rear of the office sat the Foundation 's secretary , a tall , bearded young man named Nnaemeka Achehe . He told us that he was from Onitsha , a town just inside the western border of the old Eastern Region  --  the original Biafran area  --  and that he had been in this country for six years . " The goal of our organization has always been longterm , " he said . " Now our role will he intensified . Schools must he built , and hospitals . Many people are without an arm , without a leg , without an eye . They must be retrained in new crafts . Farmers must be brought back to the farms  --  there are no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been displaced , and now they arc panic-stricken . The big task will be getting them back to their original areas . " We pointed out that his group would have to work with the permission of the Nigerian authorities from now on , if it were to work at all , and he said , " We have lost all contact with our people in Biafra , and we are working to reestablish contact with them . We are certain that the authorities will allow us to continue our work , which has now become the most important of all  --  rehabilitation and planning for the future . " Red Cross units have been active both in Nigeria and in Biafra . The International Committee of the Red Cross  --  an all-Swiss group  --  had been flying food supplies to Biafra , but it was forced to cease this activity late last summer after one of its planes was shot down by the Nigerians . Since then , the Nigerian Red Cross and the Biafran Red Cross have operated , each in its own area . To find out what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation , we called Samuel Krakow , the director of International Services of the American National Red Cross , in Washington , and he told us that a disaster specialist named Alan Platt had just had his visa approved and was leaving at once for Lagos , where he would perform liaison services between the Nigerian Red Cross and the League of Red Cross Societies . " There is no need to collect more food or more money now , " he said . " Everything exists and is ready . The only question is getting the Nigerians ' permission to bring the supplies in . You heard what General Gowon said about the other relief organizations . Thank God , we 're not in that category ! " The office of Americans for Biafran Relief , in the Graybar Building , is a small room crowded with desks and filing cabinets . The group has existed since the summer of 1968 , and its main function has been raising funds , which it has turned over to Joint Church Aid for supplies . When we stopped in on Wednesday afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Mrs. Barhara Martinez , its program coordinator , and the Reverend Fintan Kilbride , of the Holy Ghost Missionaries , who had spent thirteen years in the Biafran area before the war broke out , and who had just returned from a sixteen-day visit to the area . Father Kilbride , who is from Dublin , is a slight man with thinning and graying black hair , and he looked as if he had n't had much sleep . " I left Biafra last Friday , gut here last night , " he told us . " I think it 's the type of situation that brooks no delay whatsoever . It 's very , very critical to get the story across to people straightaway . It 's extremely important to get a team of international observers to go into Biafra at once , to he witnesses to the good  --  or otherwise  --  conduct of the Nigerian soldiers until peace is restored . And by an international oh-server team I do n't mean just four or five people  --  I mean fifty people , or maybe even a hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exterminated , Perhaps not to the last man , woman , and child , but they believe  --  and there is much evidence to support this belief  --  that there will he a selective genocide , that a lot of the educated people will be killed off , maybe under the pretext of their being war criminals . I grew up with this situation , both before the war and during the war , and I 've seen evidence of what the Biafrans call the extermination of their people . You see it , for example , in the bombing of civilian targets like hospitals and feeding centers , hut , of course , above all  --  way above all  --  in the blockade , which has already cost two million lives . Two million lives ! If that is not a form of extermination , I do n't know what is . " " There has been some encouragement in first reports that food is moving , but our concern is to see to it that enough tons are at the feeding centers soon enough to help those thousands who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for months and months , " Mrs. Martinez said . Father Kilhride folded his hands and looked at the two women for a moment . " One thing is perfectly clear , " he said . " No matter what you read in the papers , thousands of people in the l3iafran enclave are hiding in the hush now . They 're not anywhere near the Nigerian supply trucks  --  assuming any supply trucks have reached Biafra  --  and they 're afraid to make contact with Nigerians . We have a network ready to go into operation at a moment 's notice , and the people trust the missionaries . Unfortunately , whether its intentions are good or had , the Nigerian government is utterly incapable of mounting a relief effort to feed all those people . I am hoping that an arrangement can he worked out swiftly . But what I 'm afraid of is that negotiations and diplomatic tactics will drag and drag and drag and drag , and that three weeks will go by . You ca n't fool around for three weeks with the life of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
