THE UNNATURAL HISTORY OF THE NANNY <P> by JONATHAN GATHORNE-HARDY 350 pages . Dial Press . $8.95 . <P> Jonathan Gathorne-Hardy does not suppose that the institution of the nanny explains every last twitch and tweed of Englishness . But he does hold the reasonable view that the way a society cares for its young determines what the children , and thus the society , will be . And he believes no other group has insulated itself from its children quite like the British upper classes . <P> Becoming a nanny required a long , menial apprenticeship , beginning with a scrub brush on the nursery floor . In time , a girl with nanny-potential could move up to undernurse , then nurse , and finally full nanny . The author dates the flourishing of this system from about 1850 , when the Industrial Revolution increased the wealthy class in England and pried a large population of potential servants loose from the land . <P> Victorian children , the author writes , were widely regarded as " little defective adults , sodden with original sin , " which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One of nanny 's first jobs was to institute rules and punishments regulating eating and elimination . All food on the plate had to be eaten , or it would appear at the next meal . Failure to perform potty at the proper hour ( training began at six weeks ) brought the certain retribution of laxative powder . Nannying appears to have provided parents with some peculiar satisfactions . As proof that the popularity of the system spread , the author has turned up a mid-19th century French newspaper ad asking for " Une gouvernante anglaise-mthodes drastiques . " <P> It would be startling if nannying had not had a marked effect on the English character . The celebrated English unflappability is capsulized in the answer given in 1940 to a frightened two-year-old who asked about the loud noises he was hearing . " Bombs , dear , " said Nanny . " Elbows off the table . " The last thing a very drunk nanny-generation Englishman does before passing out , the author reports , " is to stagger round his room , frequently falling over , trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his shoes and finally , now probably being sick but despite this , cleaning his teeth . " <P> The nanny effect goes deeper than surface mannerisms , however . Gathorne-Hardy , British journalist and novelist ( The Office ) , is convinced that it is largely responsible for the excessive shyness and the difficulty in forming relationships that he detects among upper-class Englishmen . He offers the following psychological explanation : the nanny was the child 's main source of security and affection during the early years of development . But very often the nanny left the household when the child was still small , to be replaced by another nanny who might also leave . The child eventually learned to be extremely wary about giving love .
