txt More than $53 million in federal funds has been pumped into four of Chicago 's worst slums in the most ambitious attempt ever to improve life for the poor . It 's called the Model Cities program , and it 's in trouble . Less than $400,000 is left to finance the program , which has been spending more than $1 million a month to operate its 52 projects . Unless city and federal officials can resolve a long-standing dispute over low-income housing , the program 's only legacy to Chicago may be a few buildings and one of the most expensive temporary help projects since the Depression . Residents Moving Out Critics of the program warn that a concentration of social services alone is not enough to give a slum a new lease on life unless there is an attempt to rebuild the area physically and to reduce crime . The Model Cities areas have been losing population steadily in the last decade while crime rates have been rising just as steadily . The program has concentrated almost 90 per cent of its effort in providing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas . But this emphasis means there will be few physical improvements to show for the multimillion-dollar bill . However , administrative costs have been high  --  in excess of 50 per cent of the whole budget . More than $30 million was paid out during the 21/2-year program for administration and project workers ' salaries . The central Model Cities administrative office in the Loop has been running up a salary bill in excess of $130,000 a month . Health Centers Successful The building that has been accomplished , tho , has gone into two of the most successful projects in the program ? health care and education . Health centers are now operating in communities where there had been only two doctors for 45,000 people . An examination of the budget , funded by the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development HUD , illustrates the heavy emphasis on social services : ? $17 million for education . ? $6.3 million for health care . ? $4.9 million for sanitation services . ? $3.9 million for civilian police aides . ? $2.6 million for day care centers. ? $2.4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critical needs of the four " target areas " ? housing  --  lias been left largely unattended in spite of the loud protests of citizen councils which are supposed to have a voice in the program . There are four target areas : two on the South Side and one each on the West Side and North Side . They are : ? Woodlawn , bounded by 60th Street , Stony Island Avenue , 67th Street , and Cottage Grove Avenue . ? Grand Boulevard , bounded roughly Two T r i b u n e urban affairs reporters spent four months looking into Chicago 's Model Cities program , one of the most complex and least understood social programs of current times . Cornelia Honchar and Peter Negronida , with help from the Better Government Association , examined hundreds of records and talked to scores of persons to find out what Model Cities is all about .

Little to Be Seen A tour of the four areas shows almost no physical change brought by Model Cities , and few signs that slums will fade from the city during this generation  --  or the next . Abandoned and burned-out buildings , debris-strewn lots and alleys , broken curbs and sidewalks  --  all still decorate many of the streets in the target areas . One thing has emerged , tho  --  a new and expensive poverty burocracy under the direction of Erwin France , one of Mayor Daley 's administrative assistants . The Democratic Party has not been lett out . More than $1 million worth of business has gone to politically connected companies thruout the course of this massive spending program . Hatch Act Violated And a few precinct captains have found employment in the 52 various projects , in outright violation of the Hatch Act , which bars employes of federally funded programs from doing political party work . Wasteful spending has found its way into several projects .

Model Cities officials say they devoted the program 's first years to social services , which are difficult to evaluate and almost impossible to see . Yet the housing construction is the - key to the life or death of the entire program in two ways : 1 New housing is needed in the four target areas to combat population loss and 2 a court battle over moving public housing into white neighborhoods had tied up the release of Model Cities funds . ' Avoid Obvious Solution The city has been fighting federalcourt-ordered dispersal of public housing into white neighborhoods for almost three years . In 1970 , a study showed - that 4,300 units of low-income housing : Were needed immediately to meet the housing shortage crisis . Some of those units could be provided thru public housing in the Model Cities areas , including the blacks areas , if 700 units were constructed in white areas first , but because of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city did nothing . Then last May , in an attempt to get Chicago moving on public housing , federal officials hinged the release of $26 million in Model Cities funds to Mayor Daley 's promise to start the ball , rolling in the City Council . But the city dragged its heels , and a federal court order was obtained freezing the Model Cities money . The U. S. Court of Appeals is expected to rule soon on the release of the frozen $26 million . But until a decision is made , an austerity program , instituted last fall , is still in effect . This has cut most projects back to their bare operating essentials ; some have been forced to a complete standstill , especially those involving economic and nonprofit housing development . No Money for Medics The Board of Health is looking for ways to staff and operate two multimillion-dollar health centers , scheduled to open in a few weeks . There 's no money left in the Model Cities budget to pay doctors ' salaries ; so the board is trying to scrape together funds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been stripped of much of the staff it needs to operate its projects . City and federal officials are quick to blame each other for the funding crisis . The city claims it was unfair for the Model Cities program to be held ransom for public housing . Federal officials are beginning to think that nothing short of a total withholding of all federal funds for Chicago ? $323 million annually  --  will force the city administration to meet its lowincome housing responsibilities . Critic Sounds Alarm Pierre de Vise , an urban planner and Model Cities critic , has said that " no matter how many social services are offered or centers built , they may all be useless in a few years unless there is a building program coupled with a reduction in crime in the four areas soon . " Census figures and city housing reports show that families are moving out of the target areas by the hundreds . De Vise predicts that " in 5 or 10 years , without a dramatic change in the physical and social climate of the areas , there will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The Chicago Housing Authority has said it may be able to begin building in 1975 ? just when the Model Cities program and its federal funds are expected to end . And then it has plans for only 1,500 units . " What are the people to do in the meantime ? De Vise asks . Erwin France and administration aldermen say that , whatever problems the program may have , it is still an excellent program .
