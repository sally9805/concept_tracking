For traveling Americans , Europe will cost up to 20% more this year than last . The primary reason is the devaluation of the dollar ; in addition , most European currencies have been revalued upward . The combination of the 8.6% dollar devaluation and an average 4% upward revaluation of European currencies leaves the dollar with about 12% less purchasing power than last year . On top of that , inflation in Europe has added to the costs . <P> Although transatlantic air fares and American Express tour prices are about the same as last year , almost everything else has shot up . In London , a double room at the tony Dorchester is $48.80 v. $41.70 last year . The rate for a medium-range London hotel has been boosted from about $18 to $23 . In Paris , a traveler paying in dollars could get a double room at the Ritz for $54 last year ; this year the tab comes to $65 . A double at the Hilton in Paris has jumped $15 , to $53 . Even the price of a bed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out is also higher . London and Paris restaurant meals in dollar terms have jumped 18% . Dinner for two at Madrid 's Horcher Restaurant now averages $19 , up $4 from 1970 . Yet smorgasbord unlimited at the Hotel Norge in Bergen remains one of the world 's great gourmet bargains : it has risen only from $4.50 to $4.90 . <P> Culture also costs more , as do fun and games . Top tickets for the Stuttgart Ballet have risen from $8 to $9 , and for one Wagner Festival performance in Bayreuth they have climbed from $28.60 to $31.75 . Spanish bullfights are up roughly 8% , to $14 for the choice , shady seats . <P> The prospect of higher prices has not quenched Americans ' wanderlust . Last year close to 3,000,000 Americans visited Europe , and travel-industry leaders expect about a 10% gain this year . For those who do go , moneymen offer some advice for stretching dollars . First , carry traveler 's checks , which command a better exchange rate than cash does . Second , convert money at banks , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay immediately for foreign purchases rather than charge them . If the value of the dollar weakens further , the bill , when finally presented , may well be higher than expected .
