txt Bernard Bergman was sentenced yesterday to one year in a city prison for bribery by a New York State Supreme Court justice who brushed aside a plea bargain under which the nursing-home promoter would have received no jail term . The sentence was imposed by Justice Aloysius Melia on top of a four-month Federal term for Medicaid and tax frauds . Mr. Bergman half an hour earlier had acknowledged that he owed $2.5 million defrauded from Medicaid , and had signed over his assets to the state to be sold until that amount is raised . The justice said Mr. Bergman 's long " shilly-shallying " about the debt confirmed a probation report that he appeared to be " an unscrupulous and corrupt individual , " warped by greed , and with " no compunction " and " little or no remorse . " The defense immediately moved to withdraw Mr. Bergman 's plea of guilty , and obtained a stay until Monday to L. HESS prepare its position . Charles J. Hynes , me special state prosecutor for nursing homes , said that if the plea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his family . Mr. Bergman is to appear tomorrow before Judge Marvin Frankel in the United States District Court in Foley Square . The hearing is to determine the date for the defendant to begin his four-month term , which was widely criticized as too lenient . But the judge has said that he would reconsider his sentence if the state court imposed a harsher one . Scores of pickets from organizations of the elderly marched outside the Criminal Court Building at 100 Centre Street yesterday , urging a stiff sentence . In the courtroom , before Justice Melia entered , the scene resembled a real estate closing , which in a sense it was . Mr. Bergman and his lawyers at one table , and Mr. Hynes and his aides at another , exchanged papers and made final ( hanges in documents assigning to the state what Mr. Bergman swore were all his assets , consisting of 16 properties or shares of corporations . When the court convened , the 65-yearold defendant slumped in his seat , and his fingers tapped the table .

The prosecutor . therefore , he said , recommended that no additional sentence be imposed . Mr. Bergman 's counsel , Gustave Newman , added that the defendant had raised $250,000 in loans and was prepared to pay it to the state as an evidence of good faith . Asserting that Mr. Bergman , a first . offender , had been broken by his ordeal , he urged that the court find that " this man has suffered enough . " A hiss arose from the audience . Seeks Mercy of Court Invited to speak , Mr. Bergman said in an almost inaudible voice , " 1 ask the mercy of the court , " and sat . down . Reading from a 10-page memorandum , Justice Melia reviewed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corruption In that the defendant ' attempted , with corrupt intent , . to influence a state legislator to exert pressure to have his Park Crescent Nursing Home application approved for operation . " The reference was to the Assembly majority leader , Albert H. Blumenthal , whose indictment on bribery and perjury charges in this matter had been dismissed by Justice Melia . The court said Mr. Bergman 's testimony for the prosecution had been " done only to gain credits for himself . " " It also had the side effect , " he added , " of almost destroying a man whom I believe the evidence showed to be legally and factually innocent of the charge . ? However , that is now on appeal . In addition , the defendant , in fact is guilty of having committed ' this crime , " ' Referring to presentencing papers sub . rnitted by both sides , Justice Melia observed , " it would appear on the one hand - tliat the defendant was a suitable candidate to be fitted for wings , and on the ether hand for measurement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In aIntrast to Judge Frankel , who rejected the prosecution and probation reports and held Mr. Bergman to have had an illustrious philanthropic career marred only by the crimes he confessed , Justice Melia gave credence to a negative probation finding . He recalled that at the time of the guilty plea in March , there was no agreement on the amount or date of restitution . At first , the defense offered nothing , then $364,000 , then $1.4 million , although , Justice Melia said , " a casual look at the documentation seemed to weigh heavily in favor of $2.5 million ; so it appeared that a heavy case of foot-dragging was afield . " The taxpayer , the court said , has had In spend . large sums " in an extensive investigation to be reimbursed for that which never should have been taken from him . " The crime and the " shilly-shallying " over money , Justice Melia ' continued , led him to agree with a probation report that the defendant " appears as an inscrupulous and corrupt individual , who apparently resorted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became warped in his desire for financial gain . " The court dismissed curtly the defense argument that the frauds had been committed by an accountant without Mr. Bergman 's knowledge . Interjecting in his written text , the judge observed , " It is strange that these underlings never made an error in favor of the state . " Effect on Society Taking in consideration , on the ' one hand , the prosecutor 's recommendation for no additional time and , on the other , " concern for the proper effect of a sentence on society , " Justice Melia said he was imposing a sentence of one year , rather than the maximum of four years . In reply to a question from the defense , he added , " consecutive . " Outside the courtroom , Mr. Newman said the defense would consider a number of options , including a challenge to the bribery conviction as being in conflict with the dismissal of the Blumenthal indictment . The $250,000 " good faith " payment was not made yesterday . A spokesman for Mr. Hy.nes said Mr. pergman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assigned properties are known to be heavily mortgaged  --  the Park Crescent is in default of more than $1 million in mortgage and tax payments  --  but the spokesman was confident that the $2.5 million would be recovered .
