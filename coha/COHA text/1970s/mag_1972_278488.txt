" Nubar is so tough that every day he tires out three stockbrokers , three horses and three women . " Thus did a Cambridge friend many years ago describe Nubar Gulbenkian , the high-loving millionaire who died last week at 75 in Cannes , where he was being treated for a heart ailment . Resembling a Mephistophelean Santa Clans with his portly form , thick black eyebrows , fluffy white beard and twinkling eyes , Gulbenkian spent his life in a relentless chase after pleasure . " I believe in comfort . I enjoy everything I do , " he said . <P> He was the son of Calouste Gulbenkian , the celebrated " Mr. Five Percent , " who helped negotiate oil contracts between Arab countries and Western oil firms and wound up owning 5% of the Iraq Petroleum Co . Nubar was born in a small village on the Bosporus at a time when the Turks were enforcing their rule by slaughtering the Armenian minority . He was spirited out of the country in a Gladstone suitcase and taken to England , where he attended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iranian nationality and in 1965 regained his Turkish citizenship , he spent most of his life in England . <P> The elder Gulbenkian , as miserly as his son was profligate , employed Nubar for a time without salary . This arrangement ended in 1939 after Nubar billed the company $4.50 for a lunch of chicken in tarragon jelly , which he ate at his desk . His father refused to allow the expense , and Nubar sued for $10 million , which he felt was his due on grounds that his father had defaulted on a promise to give him a share of the business . The litigation was withdrawn by Nubar , and when Calouste died in 1955 , he left almost his entire fortune , estimated at up to $420 million , to the Gulbenkian Foundation , based in Portugal . <P> Active in the oil business while his father lived , Nubar went into sumptuous retirement in his late middle years . At his death he was estimated to be worth $5 million to $6 million . His father had left him about $2.5 million in cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settlement from the foundation 's management , from which he was shut out . Dividends from investments in solid securities also added to his fortune , which was amply sufficient for his extravagances . He drove about in a custom-built gold and black car , designed to look like a London taxi and powered by a Rolls-Royce engine . Cracked Gulbenkian : " I like to travel in a gold-plated taxi that can turn on a sixpence-whatever that is . " <P> An impeccable dresser , he almost always wore a fresh orchid in his lapel ; when visiting desert countries , he had the flowers shipped in daily . For a London party , he flew in a troupe of belly dancers from Turkey . Married three times and twice divorced , he remained childless . He had a superior attitude about good food and wine . The perfect number for dinner , he said , was two-himself and a headwaiter . In all he did , Gulbenkian remained a flamboyant refutation of the notion that the burden of having money dims the joy of living .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
