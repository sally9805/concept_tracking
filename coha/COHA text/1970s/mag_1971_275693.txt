Not for 15 years has a bona fide American reporter from a major U.S. news organization been allowed to visit Communist China . But last week , in the wake of the American table tennis team 's unexpected visit to the land of Chairman Mao , the Bamboo Curtain for correspondents finally parted a little , and the rush was on . <P> When the invitation was first issued , few U.S. newsmen bothered to try for visas to accompany the table tennis team , and with good reason . For years , veteran China watchers had become used to requesting visas via periodic cables to Peking and never receiving so much as an answer from the Foreign Ministry . Most had dropped the practice in recent years , assuming it a futile exercise . One of the few to renew their visa requests was NBC 's John Rich , who left Shanghai just ahead of Mao 's forces in 1949 , and has been China watching from Tokyo since 1962 . Rich sent off what he called his " umpteenth cable , " routinely requesting permission to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did the same on behalf of John Roderick , who interviewed Mao when he was a guerrilla fighter in Northern China during the 1940s , and has been the A.P . ' s chief China watcher in Tokyo since 1959 . To their astonishment , the Foreign Ministry replied promptly for the first time ever : Come ahead . <P> Approval of visas for Rich , 53 , and Roderick , 56 , set off a stampede . The Red-run China Travel Service , which issues visas in Hong Kong when Peking approves , was suddenly swamped . From Tokyo , United Press International 's Al Kaff desperately tried to telephone Peking for a visa to match A.P . ' s coup . To his surprise , he got through to the Foreign Ministry , only to be told politely that no more approvals were being issued for the moment . U.P.I , had to settle for stringer copy and telephoned reports from the U.S. table tennis players . <P> Opening the Door . In addition to Rich and Roderick , NBC 's Tokyo Operations Manager lack Reynolds was also admitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hong Kong , LIFE 'S British-born John Saar and German-born Freelance Photographer Frank Fischbeck were given visas , as was Tillman Durdin , 64 , of the New York Times , another old China hand who covered the Sino-Japanese War from Shanghai in the late 1930s and was the Times 's Nanking bureau chief in 1948 . Rich , Roderick and Durdin all applied for permission to open permanent bureaus in Peking . <P> It is not likely that China will go that far yet . But Premier Chou Enlai , who Roderick says remembered him after a lapse of 23 years , had a jovial chat with the journalists . " Mr. Roderick , " he said with a smile , " you have opened the door . " He promised that more U.S. journalists would be admitted later " in batches . " Almost immediately , usually stone-faced officials at Hong Kong 's China Travel Service smilingly expressed the hope that other applications to Peking would be successful .
