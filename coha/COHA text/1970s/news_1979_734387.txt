txt The nation 's capital may be basking in late summer weather , but for the Carter administration , all the current economic indicators are adding up to an early chill . The indicators ? gauges as to just how well the huge United States economy is doing ? are coming in fast and furious . What they are adding up to , in the eyes of many economists , is a picture of a clear slide into recession , continuing inflation , possible dangers ahead for the dollar , and the possibility of higher unemployment next year than the administration projection of 6 to 7 1/2 percent . At the very least , the current indicators ? mixed in with a mounting debate in Congress and within the administration about a possible tax cut early next year , add up to a " very stick " period for the economy , says Herbert Stein , former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Nixon . These indicators include : - Prime rate : Chemical Bank of New York  --  the nation 's sixth largest bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record high of 13 1/4 percent . The prime rate is the rate that banks charge their most preferred customers . - Discount rate : The hike in the prime rate , which other banks are now expected to follow , comes after the decision of the Federal Reserve Board ( Fed ) Sept. 18 hiking the discount rate ( the rate at which the Fed charges member banks for loans ) , to a record 11 percent from 10 1/2 percent . From page 1 Economic chill ? Gross national product : The government announced Sept. 19 that the gross national product ( the total of all goods and services produced in the US ) declined at an annual rate of 2.3 percent for the second quarter from April to June , 19 ' 79 . That compares to an annual growth rate of 1.1 percent for the first quarter , which ended in March . ? Gold prices : As if all that were not enough news to send economists rushing to their flow charts and econometric models , gold prices this week have been soaring to new all-time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gilt-edged commodity . After a frenzy of trading Sept. 18 , the price of gold shot to $383 an ounce in New York and $377 in Zurich . Further , data released earlier this week by the Commerce Department indicated that the personal income of most Americans rose by only $8.4 billion in August , or 0.4 percent . That works out to the slowest increase since January , and was the sixth month in 1979 in which personal income did not rise as fast as the cost of consumer goods . For Mr. and Mrs. Americdn Citizen , the sudden dizzying succession of less than sunny overall economic statistics means that the nation now is in the midst of recession , with the end not yet in sight . It means that loans , for cars , houses , and other big-ticket items will be very high . It means that as firms accumulate larger inventories , there is a real danger of being laid off the job . With all this , it also means that the high inflation rate ? now spinning along at over a 13 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until sometime next year . And even that may not happen , if there are new OPEC ( Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ) oil price hikes . Mr. Carter now is finding himself tugged in conflicting directions within his own party . Some liberal Democrats , such as Wisconsin Rep. Henry L. Reuss of Wisconsin , chairman of the House Banking Committee , argue that interest rates have gone " high enough , " and are now so unduly constricting the economy as to deepen the downward stride . Many liberals feel Mr. Carter must quickly consider a tax cut to stimulate consumer spending and help yank the economy out of recession . But Mr. Carter is standing firm with his commitments to keep the deficit as low as possible to help bring down the inflation rate , which poll after poll has shown to be the No. 1 concern of most Americans . But while that essentially conservative economic stance plays well in corporate board rooms ? and among the councils of some Republican political leaders ? it does not score well among older traditional " bread and butter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carter must " walk on eggs " sorting out day-to-day money policy decisions . He must make certain that fiscal policies do not overstimulate the economy , thus driving interest rates even higher . On the other hand , he must ( indirectly at least ) stand back while the Fed tightens the gush in the money supply to ease the inflation rate . The hike in gold prices , according to Mr. Stein , currently an economist with the University of Virginia , suggests a loss of confidence in paper currencies in general at this time . That , in turn , suggests a continuing high inflation rate , both in the US and abroad . According to Beryl W. Sprinkel , executive vice-president and economist with Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago , the economy will probably not show a real " upswing " until the first or second quarter of 1980 . That would be somewhere between March and June , well into the 1980 political year . Further , he argues , the inflation rate will likely not fall sharply until next year . The rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent , barring any unusual developments , such as new oil price hikes . But interest rates will continue to be high going into next year , which means high costs for borrowers ? and , presumably , grumbling in the election booths come primary voting days .
