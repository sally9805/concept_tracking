Along with all its energy shortages , the U.S. has one surplus-an abundance of public suspicion that natural-gas producers are holding down production to force prices up . In response to this feeling , several Government investigations were called last week to determine to what extent , if any , producers are deliberately withholding gas from the market . Interior Secretary Cecil Andrus sent a six-man team of investigators to Metairie , La. , to examine the records of four offshore fields in the Gulf of Mexico that have reported sharp production declines . Says Andrus : " If it appears that gas has been withheld , then we will move into a larger investigation . " A House commerce subcommittee headed by California Democrat John E. Moss announced it would open hearings into possible gas withholding in a week or two . Finally , President Carter let it be known that if evidence of impropriety turned up , he may direct Energy Adviser James Schlesinger to start a full-scale probe of gasmen 's production policies . <P> What the investigators may find can not be foreseen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ varieties of withholding : one that is legal and open , another that would be illegal but has never been conclusively proved . <P> Holding Fuel . Gas producers , based mainly in the South and Southwest , have indeed been holding back fuel that could be fed into interstate pipelines for shipment to the East Coast and the Midwest , because the Federal Power Commission will let them charge no more than $1.44 per 1,000 cu . ft. for it . Instead , they have been selling the gas in the states where it is produced , mainly Texas and Louisiana , at uncontrolled prices of around $2 . Indications are that the amounts of gas thus diverted are vast . Interstate pipelines took 67% of all new gas produced in the U.S. in 1967 ; in 1975 , the last year for which figures are available , they got only 13% . <P> Some producers are also refusing to pump from wells already drilled . Jones Co . Ltd. of Albany , Texas , spent $4 million drilling four wells in Colorado that one partner , Jon Rex Jones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months . But he insists that he will not connect them to a pipeline unless he is certain of getting $2 per 1,000 cu . ft. for the gas . In addition , producers in Houston readily tick off examples of fields where they are sure gas exists in commercial quantities , but where they will not drill . Reason : unless the interstate price goes to $2 , they fear drilling would not be profitable . George Mitchell , head of the Texas association of independent oil producers , mentioned one 16-million-acre field in New York , Ohio and Pennsylvania-three of the states hit hardest by this winter 's shortages . <P> Critics assert that in letting deposits remain in the ground , gas producers are putting their balance sheets ahead of the public interest . Yet , there is nothing that the Government can do about this kind of withholding . Producers have a legal right to sit on gas until they judge the price to be proper-so long as the fuel lies under private land . But a quarter of all U.S. natural gas is pumped from fields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leases to exercise " due diligence " in getting that gas out .
