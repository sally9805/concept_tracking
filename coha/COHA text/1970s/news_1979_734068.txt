txt Chicago Tribune Press Service SYDNEY . Australia ? " Rubbish , " exclaimed millionaire real estate developer Alan Bond . " Rubbish , and that 's all . " Bond rose from behind his 10-foot-wide polished oak desk and waved his hand in the air as if to flick away a fly . With the same , ease , he brushed aside the notion that supersuccessful self-made men like him are vanishing in today 's Australia . Bond arrived in Australia in 1950 , the son of a poor English emigrant , and began his career 2 years later at age 15 as a sign painter . " There 's no country in the world , not even your America , that 's as good as Many people consider Australia the golden land of opportunity or the last frontier . But in recent years unemployment arid high inflation , the twin ills of Modern society , have hit that country . This article is the first in a series by Howard , Tyner , a Tribune reporter who recently spent several weeks in Australia . Australia for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The opportunity is the same as ever . You do n't need anything to get a start except the will to work . " BOND NEATLY fits a stereotype frequently associated with Australia  --  the immigrant who left the Old World , came to the Land of Promise , and , through a CAustralia today combination of luck and hard work , struck it rich . Australia seems to breed stereotypes . If the country is n't kangaroos and koalas , then it 's boomerangs or swimmers or tennis players ; or tall , sunburned , beer-swilling Aussie soldiers in World War II ; or shapely women in skimpy swimsuits whose pictures appear in American newspapers during the coldest days of its winter . Reality , of course , does n't always live up to reputation . British novelist D. H. Lawrence came here and later wrote in his novel , " Kangaroo , " that Australia lacked " core or pith . " He mocked Australians for " working without any meaning , playing without any meaning , and yet being quite strenuous about it all . " MORE RECENTLY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , racial tension , and political cynicism ? have led many people to question Australia 's long-standing claim to be the Lucky Country . Still , Australia remains a sort of dreamland for many Americans  --  that last haven of the pioneering spirit where , as Bond says , all a man needs is the will to work . What kind of place is it really ? At least superficially , Australia is as American as it is British , even though the English colonized the country two centuries ago as a dumping ground for convicts , and it retains its place today in the British Commonwealth . " We 're British , but with a small h , ' " says Prof. Thomas Millar , a political scientist at the Australian National University in Canberra . " That is , basically British , but with an American veneer . " IN FACT , Australia probably Is more American than any country except Can // Last frontier for the pioneer spirit // ada and the United States itself . Familiar product names are everywhere ? Ford , General Motors , General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ network programs every week , everything from " Sesame Street " to " AU in the Family " to " Kojak . " Most Australians live in Americanstyle homes in American-style suburbs ; they shop in American-style shopping centers ; and , increasingly , they stop for a snack at a 's or Kentucky Fried Chicken . So , too , does American business have a huge stake here ? $730 million was invested in 1977 alone . The country 's largest livestock ranch is American-owned . American money is in mining and industry . Australians purchase more goods from the U.S. than from , anywhere else ? $2.5 billion worth last year ; and the U.S. is second only to Japan in buying Australian wares ? $1.2 billion worth in 1978 . WHERE , THEN , does that simple , rural lif e described in Colleen McCullough 's bestselling novel " Thorn Birds " fit into the picture ? Hardly at all . Despite its physical size as large as the continental U.S. and relatively small population 14 million , Australia is one of the world 's most urbanized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city , and they are no more likely to spend time on a sheep or cattle ranch than the average American . The cities  --  Sydney , Melbourne , Perth , Canberra , Brisbane , Adelaide , and Darwin to name a few  --  can be as strikingly modern as any anywhere . Sydney 's Opera House , a $120-million extravaganza that looks like a giant tulip opening toward the setting sun , is typical of the new architecture . The boutiques on Melbourne 's Bourke or Collins streets or on Perth 's St. George 's Terrace are as trendy as those in big cities anywhere . THE PEOPLE who live and work in these cities are n't the same as their predecessors , either . Until World War II , the bulk of Australians were of English or Irish stock , appropriate to the country 's history . No more . The postwar immigrant wave brought more than 4 million " New Australians " here , from continental Edrope , from the Middle East , and , more recently , from Japan and Indochina . " I wanted desperately to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mohammed All Abid from behind the wheel of his taxi in Melbourne , " so I came from Cairo to sing in Australia . That was 16 years ago . No , I never did get to sing . But I 've been a salesman , and I own six taxis now , and my wife and I are about to open an export business . She comes from Chile . " That 's one face of the New Australia . Go to the international airports in Sydney or Melbourne and signs are written in Italian , Greek , or Croatian as well as English . Check the growing assortment of ethnic restaurants and the increasing political clout of foreign groups : The 200,000-strong Croatian minority here has been strong enough to block the federal government for more than a year from closing an illegal " Croatian embassy " set up in Canberra by nationalists pushing for Croatian independence from Yugoslavia . NO WONDER government statistics show every third Australian alive today either was born abroad or has at least one parent who was . There is still the Outback , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for gold or minerals , or raise livestock under incredibly harsh conditions . An outpost such as Coober Pedy , a community of 4,000 opal miners in the South Australian desert 600 miles north of Adelaide , is like something from a history book . Bearded men burned brown by the sun hack at the red soil with picks and shovels in search of the precious stones . Many keep rifles to guard their claims . Most live in caves scooped out of the earth . As free as those " diggers " may be , most Australians have to contend with Big Government on a scale relatively larger than in the United States . With the main airlines , railways , communications , and other services publicly owned , bureaucracy runs rampant at'the state and federal level . LAWS HAVE been passed to make both voting and the use of seatbelts in cars compulsory . Welfare payments are massive ? $7 billion last year , the equivalent of $500 for every man , woman , and child in the country . Many of the changes can be called a result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , long shielded under Britain 's colonial wing and cut off by its geographical remoteness , is suffering growing pains as a result . " We 've gone so far so fast , " says a Canberra journalist who returned recently to the capital after a decade abroad . " So much has been compressed into so few years that the shoe is bound to pinch somewhere " Foremost among the problems have been unemployment and inflation , those twin bugaboos of the Western industrialized world . Traditionally , no more than one per cent of Australians were out of work at one time ; 2 or 3 per cent a year was typical for the growth in prices . FIVE YEARS AGO , all that became history . Heavy government welfare spending , huge wage settlements with unions , and higher international oil prices combined to send the inflation rate skyrocketing to 17 per , sent . Unemployment hit a record 7 per cent , a figure " almost beyond the comprehension of the average bloke , " according to Russell Prowse , a Bank of New South Wales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Malcolm Fraser to power . A dour millionaire farmer and economic conservative , Fraser used ruthless public spending cuts and tightening of interest rates and the money supply to cut inflation to 6 per cent . Unemployment remains near 7 per cent , and by Fraser 's own admission , it is unlikely to drop in the near future . Then , too , the country was hit by its own " Black Power " movement , as Aborigines , the continent 's first inhabitants , began to push for more rights and the return of their traditional lands . Conservationists have blocked urani. um.mining ; the use of drugs by young people has increased dramatically . POLITICS IN recent years , in the view of one much-traveled Australian diplomat , " has gone all volatile like in the Mediterranean countries . " Debates in Parliament often turn into character assassinations . Recently , one federal parliamentarian gave a colleague a black eye outside Parliament House in Canberra after a dispute inside . In fact , politics brought the deepest trauma to Australia and , appropriately , it was the result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's history . The tale began In 1972 when the avowedly socialist Australian Labor Party managed to win the national elections for the first time in 23 years from the more conservative although misnamed Liberal Party and its junior coalition parnter , the Country Party . Labor Prime Minister Gough Whitlam cultivated a new sense of national pride among Australians by talking back to the United States , by discouraging foreign investment so Australia could " buy back the farm , " and by being more assertive in foreign affairs . DESPITE Ills other successes , Whi. tlam proved to be an economic flop . Unemployment and inflation soared . Welfare payments grew . Unions sought to take advantage of the situation and stepped up work stoppages to press for huge wage increases . By late 1975 , opposition in Parliament was so strong that Whitlam was unable to win passage of funding bills necessary to keep the government operating . By tradition , he should have called new elections on the issue . When Whitlam refused to call elections , Australia 's governor-general stepped in . A vestige of colonial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who technically is chief of state , but whose post is largely ceremonial . In November , 1975 , Governor-General John Kerr broke the parliamentary deadlock by dismissing Whitlam from office , installing opposition leader FraDid you know ? Australians drink more beer than any other people except the West Germans . The average for West Germany is 39.04 gallons a person per year ; for Australia , 38.94 gallons . Czechoslovakia is third with 37.56 , while the United States ranks a distant 12th with 21.58. ser in his place , and calling an election , which Fraser won handily . THE ACTION electrified the country like nothing ever before . It polarized much of the nation into pro- and anti . Whitlamites . " A coup " is how Whitlam 's supporters describe that day . " Good riddance , " say opponents . Three years later , the whole issue was opened again with the serialization in most major newspapers of Kerr 's book on his decision to dump Whitlam . The former prime minister , now a university lecturer , promised his own book for later this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for politics in the Australia of today  --  rough and tough , just like in the United States , " said Gary Punch , 21 , mayor of the Sydney suburb of Hurstville . John Halfpenny , Communist head of the giant metal workers union in the state of Victoria , said : " It created a lot of cynicism that wo n't go away for a long time . A lot of us feel that if this could happen here , then any thing could . " MONDAY : Life In Australia is relaxed and informal , a place where " you do n't feel like something out there is chasing you all the time . "
