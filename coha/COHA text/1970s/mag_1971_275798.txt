IT was to be a celebrazionc , a party , an old-fashioned T-shirt , hot-dog and straw-hat festival of ethnic pride . Manhattan 's Columbus Circle was roofed with plastic streamers in red , white and green , the colors of the old country . The guy wires hummed in the breeze as an organ on the bandstand piped out random tunes for the early arrivals . Vendors set up rows of gaily colored booths to sell buttons ( WE 'RE NO. l ) , pennants ( ITALIAN POWER ! ) and other paraphernalia of prideful protest . Now , in the already shimmering morning heat , the buses came rolling in from Corona in Queens , Bensonhurst in Brooklyn , Greenwich Village and all the Little Italys of the city . The occasion was the Italian-American Civil Rights League 's second annual Unity Day , and it was meant to be fun for everyone . <P> No one was looking to enjoy himself more than Joseph Colombo Sr. , 48 , the league 's burly founder , unofficial leader and chief promoter . The head of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Colombo had discovered a double life through the league . Started casually , in one year it grew into a genuine vehicle of expression for thousands of Americans of Italian descent who had nothing to do with the Mafia or crime . Harnessing their honest sentiments , Colombo had helped Italian Americans to achieve new pride-and managed to do a few things for the narrower cause as well , like embarrassing the Justice Department and The Godfather film makers into dropping the words Mafia and Cosa Nostra from their vocabulary . <P> Thus , on his day , Colombo moved easily through the crowd , shaking hands , joking , posing for photographers . Suddenly shots rang out , barely audible above the noise of the happy crowd . Colombo crumpled to the ground , bleeding heavily from the head and neck . <P> Almost immediately , another volley sounded and his assailant , a black posing as a photographer who only seconds before had been filming Colombo , pitched forward face down , dead . Later identified as Jerome Johnson , 24 , he had been silenced by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posing as part of Joe 's retinue . Johnson 's killer escaped as professionally as he had carried out his mission , shooting Johnson three times even as police clustered around . <P> Hysterical spectators either rushed to see what was happening or fled in fear of more gunfire . There were confused shouts of " They got Joe ! Joe 's dead ! " As word that the assailant was black rippled through the crowd , shock gave way to anger . Several blacks were roughed up . One , a musician who had been hired to entertain later in the day , was beaten by five or six men as onlookers shouted , " Kill him ! Kill him ! " <P> <P> Life Follows Art <P> With blood streaming from the bullet wounds , Colombo was rushed to nearby Roosevelt Hospital . In a five-hour operation , surgeons removed the most damaging bullet , which had lodged in Colombo 's cerebellum . Placed under intensive care , Colombo failed to regain consciousness , and despite the resurgence of some vital signs , was given only a fifty-fifty chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have never made it to the operating table . Said one doctor : " He 's tough as hell . "
