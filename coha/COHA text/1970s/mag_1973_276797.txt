When Nixon Speechwriter William Safire left the White House last January to become a columnist for the New York Times , most saw the move as a peace offering from Times Publisher Arthur Sulzberger to the newly re-elected Administration . On an Op-Ed page dominated by such consistent Nixon critics as James Reston , Tom Wicker and Anthony Lewis , Safire could provide a steady injection of pro-Administration counterpoint . But the new commentator had knocked out exactly one column ( on April 16 ) before the President made his first public admission of White House involvement in the Watergate scandal . Since then , Safire has been forced to ignore nearly everything except that political hurricane . <P> " Watergate is not a significant defeat , " he wrote in his second column , " but it was developing into one , and the President moved in the nick of time .
