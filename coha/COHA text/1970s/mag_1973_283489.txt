O LUCKY MAN ! <P> <P> This nearly overwhelming film is part epic allegory , part lighthearted Brechtian morality play and part three-ring circus . It is the saga of a young English coffee salesman ( Malcolm McDowell ) , a description as precise and inadequate as saying that Gulliver 's Travels concerns the misadventures of a ship 's surgeon . In O Lucky Man ! Lindsay Anderson calls on all the resources of the cinema , challenges them and extends them . The movie is brash , eclectic , innovative , deeply personal and elusive-all at once . It is a transcendent movie ; perhaps even a great one . <P> The story is a sort of streamlined Pilgrim 's Progress shot through with vigorous satire . McDowell , a peerless young actor of apparently unlimited range , appears as Mick Travis , who when last seen was shooting up his prep school common in Anderson 's // . Here again , Travis is afloat in a society that is both recognizable and out-of-joint , where business meetings can turn into blase conferences on genocide . Mick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world forms the classic curriculum for his picaresque education . <P> His journey is accompanied by some jauntily savage songs provided by the remarkable Alan Price , who , besides appearing as an actor , often comes onscreen to provide musical comment and counterpoint . " So smile while you 're making it. / Laugh while you 're taking it. / Even though you 're faking it , / Nobody 's gon na know , " Price sings at one point , as Mick , with his radiant smile and infinite belief in his own good fortune , tries to charm and brazen his way to the top . He is outwitted and undone at every turn , tortured in an atomic plant , made the scapegoat in an elaborately criminal international cartel . <P> Even when Mick devotes his life to charity , he is confounded . <P> Bedraggled , without hope and apparently out of luck , he decides to answer a casting call . The director , who is Lindsay Anderson , photographs him ( a clapper board reads : " O Lucky Man ! <P> Scene 755 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a machine gun ( echoes of I ) , then tells him to smile . <P> Mick will not . " What 's there to smile about ? " he demands . Anderson smacks him on the head with a script , an ironic rendering of one of those moments of illumination in Zen . The corners of Mick 's mouth twitch upward into the beginnings of a grin : he understands what there is to smile about . <P> Everything in the film could be considered a kind of flashback from this one moment . Mick reassesses his recent life with the new knowledge that the only way to deal with absurdity is to recognize it . Winning that insight , he may be again the lucky man .
