txt A secret Air Force investigation of narcotics use and alleged espionage at an intelligence base has led to charges of a " witch hunt , " a service inquiry into the methods employed by its Office of Special Investigation and a strong Defense Department rebuke . Air Force officials said the office might be overhauled as a result of its investigation last summer at the Buckley Air National Guard Base , a heavily guarded facility in Aurora , a Denver suburb . Dr. Hans Mark , Undersecretary of the Air Force , who is now overseeing the case , conceded in an interview that the service had " erred " in the Buckley investigation . " Obviously things happened that were wrong , " Dr. Mark said . Last September , 48 civilian employees at the base were abruptly dismissed  --  for " excessive drug use , " an Air Force spokesman said at the time . The employees pay that they had conceded , in the course of intensive interrogations and polygraph tests , that they smoked marijuana now and then . By all accounts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leak was being investigated , not a drug case , and that they should admit marijuana use to protect themselves against blackmail by enemy agents . Sources in Denver and Washington said the investigation had produced no evidence of espionage . Dr. Mark said , " A major problem here is that instructions given to the investigators were confusing . One investigation // was ? for espionage . ? The other was for drugs .. To the extent that our .. procedures confused the two , we erred . Why did it happen ? iI do n't know yet . " ? ? Threw Away Rulebook ' , " It was incredible , " ? said ' Cathie Ann Shattuck , an attorney for the American Civil . Liberties ** who represents most of the dismissed . employees ... " The Air Force just threw away , the legal rulebook . " Of the 48 civilians who were dismissed , 39 . have been reinstated in'redent Weeks , most ? of therm contract employees of the Hughes Aircraft Corporation andthe Lockheed Missile Division . Five others arc ' awaiting further word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who worked for the National Security Agency ; have been ' told fit ) resign or face ' dismiss  --  sal ' becanse ' they are fulltime Government employees and have admitted smoking  --  marijuana. ? " We were just shanghaied , " said Judy Overby . Her husband , Ron , who was one of the:four N.S.A employees and had been doing ? secret work for 16 years , was forced to resign after telling agents that he smoked a marijuana cigarette with friends every few months . " It ' , was disgraceful , " she said . " They told Ron they were after espionage people and wanted Ron to tell them- everything he knew about drug use . on the base They said government secrets could be sold to support  --  a drug habit . ' Doing His Duty ' " Ron felt he was doing his duty . He racked his ? brains , told them the names of the associates he smoked with . He said there was nothing to hide ; ' after all , it ' was espionage they were interested in. not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right out froin under him and took away his clearance . It was horrible . " Even the reinstated employees , who are in their late 20 's and 30 's , are bewildered and furious . Several of them arc weighing civil suits against the Air Force On a personal level , there have been ' marital separations , ' financial troubles , tension among colleagues and neighbors . " It took a few days for me to realize what happened , " said . one of the rein stated employees , who told agents- he smoked marijuana about three times a year . " One night I just sat , down and cried for an hour . Like a baby . I worked at that base seven and a half years . I briefed the base commander , every day . And they kicked me out like that . I felt somehow dirty . I felt ashamed . " The Air Force declines to discuss the operation of the base , which . is part of the Space and Missiles Systems Organization The facility , which includes.five big white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a receiving station for signals sent to earth from American satellites . The coded data are said- toi ? be collected and interpreted at the facility for use by intelligence agencies . Many of the civilian employees work in data processing arid have specialized . processing secret clearances : They earn anywhere from $15,000 , to $23,000. a year and , are generally college-educated and somewhat conservative . " The first person ' who called us said he ' smoked a joint about six times ' in the last five years , " ' said James H. Joy , the A.C.L.U. executive director in . Colorado " It was hardly a hippie community out there . " In the last ' 18 months , the Office of Special Investigation has , been the subject of increasing scrutiny and , in some cases , criticism because of its broad crackdowns at air bases . More than 30 security policemen at Lowry Air Force Base in Colorado we 're ' recently given general discharges , a lower status than honorable ones , after an undercover informant accused them of using drugs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved onto the ' Buckley base after one employee , seeking an extension Of his five-year security ' clearance , . was asked about drugs and replied that he lied been to a Denver party at which several colleagues had smoked marijuana . What worried the investigators , as they reportedly made clear in interrogations , was the possible repetition of the drug , blackmail and espionage case last . year in Los ** which Christopher J. Boyce , 24 , a code room operator at T.R.W. Inc. and a reported drug user , was convicted of passing secret informa ? Hon through another man , Andrew Dal . Lon Lee ; a herciin addict . T.R.W. handles secret information similar to ' that ' report . edly processed at the Buckley facility . One 33-yeareld civittan employee ' Who was dismissed and reinstated said : " They told me not to worry . They told me they were n't interested in marijuana but in espionage. , They mentioned the T.R.W. case and said that 's why they were here . " I figured I had nothing to hide and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the first time at U.C.L:A . They kept asking me who I knew smoked , who I thought smoked , who looked like they smoked , if I knew any rumors about people who smoked . They said I was helping my country , ' doing my duty , by telling them . They tricked me . " Lawyers Barred Lawyers were barred from the sessions on the ground they lacked full security clearances , the employees said . After their security clearances were withdrawn and they were dismissed , the employees said , agents told them that no avenues of appeal Were.open to them and that it would be a " breach of security " if they told anyone why they lost their jobs , Several weeks later , however , aides to Representative Pitt Schroeder and Senator Gary Hart , both Colorado Democrats , began receiving protests from - the dismissed employees . Some went to the Anierican CiYil Liberties Union , whose executive director , ' Mr. Joy , termed the investigation a " witch hunt . ' ? Prodded by Representative ' Schroeder and Senator Hart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . by Carl Feldbaum , the Inspector for Defense Intelligence , ' to investigate the ease in Den ver and then " at the headquarters . of the Space and Missile Systems Organization in Los Angeles . Although the Feldbaum'report is secret , it is widely ' known in the Defense - Department to be highly critical of the:Air Force inquiry and to say that the employees were.unfairly dismissed .. In late October , the Secretary of the Air Force , John Stetson , ordered Maj. Gen. John E. Kulpa Jr . of the Space and Missile Agency in Los Angeles " to review the- criteria applied in reaching the decisions to withdraw access . " In practical terms , the order was designed to . allow reinstatement of the employees . Colonel at Base Resigned The base commander , Col. James Bagwell , announced his resignation from the Air Force earlier this month , amid speculation that he had been forced , to do so . Dr. Mark declined to discuss the reasons for the resignation , and Colonel Bagwell could not be reached for comment . At this point , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet . been reinstated . Miss Shattuck and the A.C.L.U. , who say . that Dr. Mark has been cooperative , nonetheless criticize ntm for failing so ? far to reinstate the five , who had an interview with him recently in the Pentagon . Dr. Mark said he was still studying the five cases . and indicated that once these were resolved , the Air Force would deal with the way Its agents handled the matter .. Beyond this , he said , the Air Force and other services are faced with ' a delicate problem , underscored by the Buckley case , of how to , deal with civilian employees in sensitive.areas who casually smoke marijuana off the base . In the . Denver area , marijuana . smokers are generally not prosecuted . " The difficulty is , you can make standards , but can ' you make a uniform set of standards ? " ' said Dr. Mark , " It 's most difficult with contract employees . In Denver there 's one standard . But , what happens at a sensitive installation in Mississippi ? How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troubling . "
