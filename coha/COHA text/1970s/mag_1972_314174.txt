" Hijacking mostly for political purposes appears to be fading . We 're now confronted with something else , probably even more dangerous : extortion . We 're in a new and very dangerous phase . " <P> That ominous and prescient prediction made last month by Federal Aviation Administrator John Shaffer came all too true last week , the most frightening that U.S. aviation has ever known . The episode began with a call to Trans World Airlines by a man who called himself Gomez . He directed officials to a Kennedy Airport locker containing it note saying that there were bombs on four TWA airliners set to go off over an 18-hour period ; he would locate them all in exchange for a $2,000,000 ransom . <P> Before the week was out , one TWA plane , sitting empty in AP Las Vegas , was blasted apart . Another in New York was narrowly saved when a bomb in the cockpit was defused just minutes before detonation . Dynamite was found on a United Air Lines flight into Seattle . And , in a fourth incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned that two plastique explosive devices were concealed in spray cans aboard a United 727 . The cans were discovered when a federal agent searching a suspected suitcase noticed a can of Right Guard and of Noxzema seemed too heavy . There were massive delays for passengers everywhere . and at President Nixon 's order all U.S. airlines began a major tightening of aircraft security and passenger screening . <P> Miraculously , no one was injured in the rash of bomb planting , some not the work of Gomez but probably inspired by his example . ( Airport switchboards across the country were flooded with crank calls of false bomb threats . ) Gomez himself gave the location of the TWA bomb that was found , warning that it was on Flight No. 7 , which had just taken off from New York for Los Angeles . The plane hurried back to Kennedy Airport and was emptied ; then two sniffer dogs trained to smell out explosives boarded the ship . It was their first live test , and one of them located the device almost immediately in a briefcase in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go off . That was scary enough , but the explosion that ripped through the forward section of a TWA 707 in Las Vegas was more frightening for another reason . The plane , which had landed from New York seven hours before , had been searched three times : before departing , in the air and after it arrived . Yet somehow , someone had managed to put the bomb into the cockpit undetected . <P> Vigorous Security . The general consensus within industry and government is that to pay an extortionist 's demands simply invites more attempts . But with a fleet of 239 planes and a daily passenger load of about 30,000 at this time of year , TWA may have felt that it had to make an attempt to deal with Gomez . A private plane , perhaps containing the $2,000,000 , flew from New York to Atlanta . It returned to New York four hours later , and a nervous TWA spokesman subsequently said that Gomez had not been heard from again by week 's end .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
