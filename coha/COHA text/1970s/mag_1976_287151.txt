So involved has Lebanon 's civil war become after 15 months that the latest ceasefire , announced last week , is not even between Lebanese . Rather , Syria and the Palestine Liberation Organization , each battling in support of opposing local forces , agreed to stop fighting . Their agreement was tenuous , especially since it very obviously favored the stronger Syrians . <P> TIME Jerusalem Bureau Chief Donald Neff , supplementing his contacts in Israel with interviews in Washington , cabled this Middle East estimate : <P> All the warring parties-the Palestinians , the Arab Moslems and Christians , the Syrians-remain too strong and see the stakes too high to end the struggle soon . Top diplomats expect no significant changes in the Middle East in the near future . Progress is stalled not because of the U.S. elections ( for once ) but because of the turmoil in the Arab world over Lebanon . Before the civil war , there seemed a chance , however slight , that Henry Kissinger could follow up last September 's successful Sinai interim agreement between Israel and Egypt with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lebanon blew up , so did opportunities for further step-by-step diplomacy . <P> For better or worse , Kissinger 's diplomacy since the 1973 war has left the Soviet Union with little influence in Egypt . Even Moscow 's strong position in Syria is waning because the Soviets have sided increasingly with the more radical Palestinians and leftists against Damascus . Says a U.S. official : " Russia is out of the picture . " <P> But so , in a way , is the U.S. While Washington waits for a Lebanese solution to arrive , like some Arabic Godot , it can not use its unique position to broker peace . Jerusalem is in no mood to negotiate now , with the Syrians trying to snap a leash in Lebanon on Israel 's old enemies , the Palestinians . Initially , Jerusalem worried that Syria would use its involvement in Lebanon as a pretext to take over the country or to launch a surprise attack against Israel . But last spring , after Syria gave private assurances to the U.S. that its intervention in Lebanon was not aimed at Israel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Israeli officials now quietly applaud Syrian President Hafez Assad 's aims in Lebanon as modest and constructive ; a year ago he was routinely described in Israel as a fanatical foe . <P> Losing Strength . In recent months , Syria 's 15,000 troops in Lebanon have helped bring the P.L.O.-Moslems largely , but not completely-under control . Libya has desperately tried to help the Palestinians , pouring as much as $50 million into P.L.O . coffers in one month . Iraq and Egypt have given verbal support to the besieged leftists , but few arms have been getting through because of a Syrian naval blockade that is occasionally supported by Israeli ships . So weak has the P.L.O . now become that when the U.S. admitted that it had direct contacts with the P.L.O . ( in order to secure the safety of Americans being evacuated from Beirut as well as the protection of the 15 embassy staff members remaining in the city ) , Jerusalem barely cared . Said an Israeli official : " The P.L.O . is losing strength , and we think it unlikely that the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is becoming less and less important . "
