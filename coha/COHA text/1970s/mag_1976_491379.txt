Every morning before dawn in the Artibonite Valley in the mountains of Haiti , hundreds of rural people start their journey to the village of Deschapelles . These travelers come from as far as fifty miles on foot or on burros , down mountain paths both steep and narrow , or in crowded buses over rutted roads . The Artibonite Valley , once a lush paradise of fruit and hardwoods in the French colonial era , is now only sparsely covered with trees . Exploitation of these forests since the 1630 's has left the moun(Below) Larimer Mellon opened l'Hb'pital Albert Schweitzer in 1956 .

A sign on the main road points to the peasants ' destination , PHOpital Albert Schweitzer . Even at first glance , the one-story rambling complex of native limestone buildings reflects the energy , goodwill and comforting spirit which characterize the hospital 's founders , Dr. and Mrs. Larimer Mellon .

The hospital offers the finest in medical and nursing care for a population afflicted with a high incidence of communicable diseases and malnutrition . A grand-nephew of financier Andrew William Mellon , Larimer Mellon was once a " cowpuncher " with a successful string of cattle ranches in Arizona and a family of four children . But in the late 1940 's his career changed dramatically as a result of a peculiar set of circumstances . Mellon was intrigued when he read a Life magazine article about the physician , philosopher , theologian and musician , Albert Schweitzer , and his life 's work in Equatorial Africa . Coincidentally , two days later , Mellon received a letter from his brother Matthew in Germany telling him about Dr. Schweitzer and their corn- mon interest in Johann Sebastian Bach . The letter advised him : " This is a man you should learn about . " Mellon was inspired and initiated a correspondence with the doctor which lasted for years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of reverence for life , and suddenly found himself confronted with a major decision , one which would affect his future and that of his wife Gwen . When a close friend commented : " You 've really got it bad , " Mellon made his decision . The Mellons sold their properties in Arizona , Mellon enrolled in the Tulane University Medical School in New Orleans , and Gwen began training as a lab technician . At the time they were thirty-nine and thirty-eight respectively . Mellon 's inspiration from Dr. Schweitzer sustained him as he pursued his medical studies . Schwitzer told Mellon to wait until he had completed two years of medical school before visiting the Schweitzer hospital at Lambarene , in West Africa . He advised Mellon : " Thread your way through school , and do n't worry about making a stellar performance . . . take just what is needed to wangle the degree . " He added , " Do n't depend too much on books , because in the field you will learn much faster . " And finally : " When you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be free from government interference . Independence is essential for success . " As plans for a hospital progressed , the Melons began looking for a site . They started in South America . Had it not been for bad rains which discouraged any further penetration into the Peruvian Amazonia , and the fact that they did n't see many Indians in need of medical attention , they might have gone on and settled there . Instead they returned to New Orleans to settle in for seven years of medical school training . During the last two years of school , Mellon chose Haiti as a place to collect information for a thesis on tropical ulcers . As he traveled about the republic he was advised to investigate the Artibonite Valley , an area of some 600 square miles with a dense population . There the incidence of disease was overwhelming , and the victims virtually deprived of modern medicine . At the same time there were high hopes for a joint U.S.-Haiti irrigation project under the Organisme du Developpement de la Vallee de l'Artibonite ( ODVA ) , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw that the rising population , with its acute health problems , made the area ideal for their task . " To be of greatest service you must find a place where there are fewest hands for the greatest need , " he wrote later . Through the assistance of Haiti 's president , Paul Magloire , land was granted to the Mellons at no cost for as long as the hospital would continue to operate . The late John Lord King , a famous tropical hospital architect , designed the hospital . American contractors and local workmen collaborated for eighteen months on the $2 million project . The best equipment available was installed , and twenty years later it is still in excellent working condition . " Nothing was compromised , " says Miss Walborg Peterson ( " Miss Pete " ) , one of the original staff nurses . " Stainless steel fixtures and proper beds with good mattresses were imported . Operating rooms were given full attention . " The hospital is largely self-sufficient . Water is piped in from the mountains ; the hospital generates its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fruit , milk , meat , eggs all come from the hospital 's farm , nearby dairy , and poultry houses . The community even has its own telephone system . A circular stone courtyard fronts the main reception and outpatient wing of the hospital . Many patients come here the night before clinic day to sleep under a great banyan tree in the center of the driveway or under overhangs to one side . Long , low-roofed pavillions surround another court in the middle of the complex . All the buildings are connected by covered walks . Walking briskly around the hospital , or driving to various projects in his dusty Land Rover , Dr. Mellon is in his element . He wears a cloth on his head , topped by a well-worn pith helmet , and sometimes carries an enormous golf umbrella for protection against the sun . Above all others , the quality that has made him so enduring is that he shares the pain of the people around him . He is doctor , engineer , farmer , teacher , musician and friend , and seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No task is too great or too small , because he can communicate ? with the poor as well as the rich . When one gives continually so much of one 's wealth , time , and energy , little things mean a lot . There is now a " second generation " around Deschapelles , that is , the children of patients who first came to H.A.S . Young mothers now bring their children to the hospital , not when they are half dead , but when they complain of aches , . pains and colds . The Mellons and longtermers delight in the recognition of these children , as well as the child with a book of Creole exercises written in a classic French hand . That 's what keeps the community alive : sharing not only the pain which is all too prevalent , but the common joys as well and the results of hard work . On my first day at Deschapelles , when we entered the pediatric ward at H.A.S. , I felt the impact and importance of the Mellons ' undertaking . Out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ages with manifestations of acute malnutrition . Some were suffering from edema , a general swelling or puffiness caused by the accumulation of watery fluid in cellular tissue . Others were listless and swollen from kwashiorkor , a pathological condition which results from protein deficiency in the diet , or stiffened and frail from the effects of lockjaw . In another , isolated ward were young victims of tuberculosis , another disease so prevalent in rural Haiti . After twenty years , l'HOpital Albert Schweitzer has created an awareness of health that is growing in the community . With such encouragement , the Mellons still retain their hopeful visions and have not permitted themselves to give in to frustrations . Instead , their community efforts have expanded farther and farther to meet the increasing challenges of the environment . In 1964 Dr. Mellon observed : " As my wife Gwen and I stood under a broiling sun in December , 1954 , we thought of the 250,000 people living in this valley and of their many needs  --  our minds jumped from one idea to another : pure water for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance to learn how to sign one 's name , relief from bone-shaking chills and fatal fevers . Although it was exciting to know that we could be of service to the people of Haiti , it was frustrating to realize that everything could not be done in one day ! Where should we begin ? " Treating and containing the vast medical problems of the population was the obvious first step . Preventive medicine and upgrading the living conditions , they decided , would evolve later . The worst diseases were at the hospital doors when it opened in 1956 . Though unfamiliar with modern techniques , Haitians , young and old , came in droves . Among them were victims of venereal diseases , tuberculosis , malaria , whooping cough , rheumatic fever , heart disease , typhoid fever , tetanus , hypertension , chronic diarrhea , and anemia ; many were suffering from malnutrition . Working with an initial staff of one pediatrician , one internist , one surgeon , one anesthesiologist and five trained ( Far Left ) A mother comforts her malnourished child who is being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Albert Schweitzer is frequently called " Madame Mellon 's Hospital " due to the time and energy she devotes to it . nurses , the Melons had to ration time and space . The clinic could then handle only about 1,000 patients per week , and there were only fifty-five beds for inpatients . All nontechnical jobs were performed by local aides and auxiliaries trained at the hospital . At that time Dr. Mellon put into practice his belief : if many developing countries . By 1972 eleven communities were able to benefit from these centers , with gratifying results . Widespread immunization against tetanus and tuberculosis , careful case study , and supervised therapy in the villages have made tremendous improvements in the standard of rural health . Part of the effectiveness of the Community Health Program is the personal factor . Volunteers make regular home visits to families in the mountains on foot , horse or jeep to encourage parents , measure progress , and Continued on page 109 the hospital is to serve Haitians , then it should be operated by Haitians . Today most of the departments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Muller Garnier , and Dr. Jean-Adrien Hilaire , Director of Community Health . Most foreigners are resident doctors and medical staff . In 1959 an average of only 100 children were immunized each month , since hospital staff were occupied with consistently high case loads . Today their work in preventive medicine has grown and the program in community health is a refined and far-reaching attempt not only to immunize , but to educate and encourage good health practice . Through the combined efforts of Drs . Warren and Gretchen Berggren from Harvard 's School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine , a program was designed to give special services to the people in the Artibonite Valley . Why ? " Because we kept seeing from 1956 to 1967 more and more malnutrition , more and more tuberculosis , and more and more tetanus , " said Dr. Hilaire . With sophisticated organization , the program began attacking these three major public enemies . Malnutrition is the " disease " that affects 75 percent of the younger patients served by the hospital . " Mothercraft Centers " in outlying villages help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the nutritional recuperation of her child . The program , initiated in Haiti , is now used in check to see if they are following the prescribed treatment . One day I joined two volunteers on a visit to a nutrition center . I set my alarm for 2:30 a.m. but was wide awake at 2:00 , in anticipation of the long expedition into the mountains . By 3:00 a.m. we had all assembled : Dr. Mary Alice Helikson , a surgeon , and Dr. Anne Fulton , an ophthalmologist , both Yale residents , on three-month tours of duty at H.A.S. , Nerette Louisjuste , the assistant director of the Nutrition Center , Fleury , our guide , and myself . There was no moon as we rode out into the night , only pale stars , and the few lights of the hospital . All I recognized was the sweet scent of guava trees . An hour later , at the town of Verrettes , we passed a quiet market , then a cemetery , and found a jeep trail leading up into the foothills . This trail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years before , was broad and flat like a road . As the sun came up , women began to appear with baskets on their heads , piled high with shiny avocados , mangos , bananas or evenly cut firewood . Then we heard the sounds of squealing pigs and goats as their owners tethered them to tree branches to forage for the day . As Nerette and I rode ahead , she explained to me in French about the nutrition centers . " Their primary function is to train mothers in elementary child care . In Nen Poste , forty-five mothers were invited to attend six days a week , for three months . We will meet Jean Renan Estiva , the responsable or supervising nutritionist , whose job is to keep the children 's weekly health reports , as well as to plan proper meals . On a rotational basis , the mothers journey two-hour distances to help with the cooking and learn fundamental principles of hygiene and nutrition . All the food used in the classes is common to every household , and available in every market . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7:30 a.m . Forty or more children greeted us , sitting on a large mat with tin plates and spoons in hand , feasting on generous portions of bean soup . Four local women were busy stirring enormous pots over a fire . Others watched their children , or sat in the shade of the overhanging roof of a typical Haitian house . There is no doubt about the effectiveness of these centers . In one week the hospital can feed forty-three children and four mothers two meals a day for $38.95 . This is approximately seven cents per meal . After completing the course , the women should be able to feed themselves and their families , providing they are able to wrest something from the land . But the problemsconfronting the farmer are formidable . According to Andre Herve Cleophat , the hospital agronomist , " the biggest problems in Haiti which make farming difficult are erosion , deforestation , and overpopulation . " On the hillsides near Deschapelles only a few people are terracing their land , and sizable rocks make cultivation almost impossible . One of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government , with little success . There has been almost no enforcement and the new trees are recklessly cut down , or pulled up , for firewood . Dr. Mellon has planted thousands of trees and makes seedlings available to anyone for the asking . But few ask . He feels the situation is extremely serious : " Mahogany is carelessly taken out , even the small trees . Why ? For tourist souvenirs . " Until better soil management and agricultural practices are adopted , nutrition will continue to be a problem . The cycle of poor nutrition and susceptibility to disease will not be broken . Women and children will continue to enter the hospital malnourished , be rehabilitated , then return to unproductive homesteads . The third area in which the hospital has made great contributions is raising health standards . Dr. Mellon and his team of workers visited neighboring communities and madewells safe from contamination , piped pure water down from mountain springs , and built public showers and privies  --  in some villages for the first time . But none of this work is done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people what they think they need . Then he offers his assistance in any way feasible . Responding to " felt needs " has become Mellon 's credo . One morning he took me to look at a dam he had helped construct a few years ago . En route , he pointed to a bridge on the road . One track led to the bridge , one went around it . As we drove around it , he showed me where the bridge had collapsed , pointing out that it had remained this way for many months . " Look , " he said with evident disappointment , " no one has gotten around to repairing it . " Soon we were tramping through corn fields and rice paddies . He had assisted in the construction of a dam to hold back a tributary of the Artibonite River . Irrigation ditches led water onto the flood plain for the cultivation of rice . We were going to inspect the dam , which he believed time and weather had swept away . As we walked along the paths , people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Papa . " Then children would follow him asking , Where are you going ? " He answered , " Where are you going ? " and they said , " Wherever you 're going ! " At the site of the original dam he stepped up on a wall and flashed a broad smile . " Look at this ! They 've built their own dam , and it 's the damnedest dam I ever saw . " The first dam had washed away , but in its place was a new one made from the old pilings , stones and timber . It worked just fine . While Dr. Mellon is more concerned with the affairs in the community , Mrs. Mellon stays in close touch with the hospital . Since the first day the hospital opened its doors , she has been at the reception desk registering patients by 6:00 a.m . The local people have for years called it " Madame Mellon 's hospital " as a result . At 7:30 she leaves the desk and meets a pediatrician in a courtyard . She translates for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has unending energy and with it , the art of saying a kind word to relieve a child 's fear . Patricia Rhoads , an attractive nurse in her late twenties , left Philadelphia General Hospital two and a half years ago and still has no great urge to return . " My parents want me to come home , but I love my work , and especially enjoy the Haitians , their generosity and kindness , " she says . She shares a three-bedroom house with a Dutch nurse . Christmas cards and Haitian crafts hang on the walls . A hot plate , small icebox and pantry suffice for cooking and keeping food . ( The nurses and part of the staff take their meals in the hospital dining room . ) What kinds of things does she miss from the United States ? " Nothing much . It 's when I 'm in the U.S. that I miss Haiti . " In her spare time she sometimes leaves the hospital for a weekend in Port-au-Prince , or spends the afternoon on the beaches near Saint-Marc , about twenty-five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the community , takes time to contribute to one of the hospital 's favorite projects , a tuberculosis recuperation center called L'Escale . Because of the many tubercular patients the hospital treats daily , everyone realized the desperate need for a recovery area for those who were still too sick to return home and in need of hospital care . Over ten years ago the staff conceived of and built L'Escale ( French for " stopover " ) . Today , they continue to support this small village , located about a quarter of a mile from the hospital . There is space for forty TB patients , who need and receive daily medication and healthy meals . L'Escale supplies its own food and personnel . Only medication is donated by the hospital . The funds to operate L'Escale are raised by the staff through fetes and bazaars . Ms. Rhoads and other nurses sew and create their best arts from the kitchen in their spare time , which they contribute for sale at the annual parties . continued from page 88 Some critics have argued that the $2 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones . Dr. Mellon counters : " Would those hospitals have attracted medical specialists ? They need certain facilities that H.A.S . can offer . " The tight economic pinch has made a definite impact on the hospital . Medical and general supplies are shipped from the United States , and inflated prices have led to cutbacks in every area . The number of beds has been reduced from 200 to 150 , and the rising cost of medicines has also cut into the budget . Moreover , since the hospital uses diesel generators for its own electricity , the fuel shortage hit very hard . But Dr. Mellon has not cut down on essentials . Lights are still on late at night to aid the nurses in their work . There is an irresistible urge to compare Mellon with the man who so totally influenced his life . But Albert Schweitzer and Lorimer Mellon are similar in only a few , though significant , ways . Their personal service in hospitals located in countries of need is foremost . But Schweitzer practiced as a missionary ; the Mellons have not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are well loved and respected in Haiti because they came on their own , unlike some missionaries who seem to trade care for the Gospel . " In his dealings with people Schweitzer was known for his " peasant shrewdness , " and like him , Mellon has the savvy to drive a fair bargain . Nothing is blatantly given , nor is anyone ever taken advantage of . Both men also shared an enthusiasm for Bach ; Mellon plays several instruments , Mrs. Mellon the flute . Music has always been their favorite means of relaxation . But here the similarities end . For all of his outstanding scholarly and medical contributions , Schweitzer was a patriarchal figure and was noted for the firm control he held over every facet of work and management in his hospital . Even today his memory is not revered by some Gabonese for this reason . Mellon , however , has never imposed himself on his hospital , and is more aware than anyone of the problems a heavy hand creates .
