Geneva recedes , and a U.S.-Israeli showdown looms <P> The Geneva Conference on Middle East peace , which was recessed in 1974 , has since assumed the mystique of some diplomatic Camelot : in Geneva , some day , somehow , Israelis and Arabs will shake hands , sit down together and hammer out a permanent agreement ending 29 years of constant tension and frequent all-out war . That vision had taken hold in many capitals , notably Washington . But last week , as Secretary of State Cyrus Vance concluded his eleven-day swing through six Middle East states , * a Geneva Conference was clearly impossible by October , highly unlikely any time in 1977 , and in general seemed more remote than ever . <P> Even Vance , who all along has been much less optimistic than his boss , seemed disappointed by the problems the U.S. faced in even getting the sides together on how to negotiate . Said he bluntly : " There are wide gaps . " Among the widest : <P> Territory The Israelis told the Secretary of State that they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heights and in the Sinai . That was nothing new . But what of the all-important West Bank of the Jordan River , on which the Arabs ( and Washington ) want a home for the Palestinians ? Israel 's hard-lining Premier Menachem Begin not only continued to insist that Israel must keep the West Bank but went even further than that : he announced a tough additional condition against " foreign rule " there . By that he meant that Jerusalem would not even go along with creation of a West Bank Palestinian enclave under Jordanian sovereignty-a formula that Begin 's Labor predecessors had been prepared to accept . <P> Procedure The sides remain deeply split on the mechanics of Geneva . Begin demands face-to-face Arab-Israeli talks without any preliminary negotiations . The Arabs want ample advance negotiations , with the U.S. acting in an honest broker role to iron out the tough issues ahead of time and thus avoid a calamitous breakdown . Vance largely agrees . Said he last week : " I myself believe the more that can be resolved before Geneva , the better we will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " as Syria 's President Hafez Assad calls it , the two sides seemed wider apart than ever . The Arabs insist on Palestinian representation in Geneva . But Begin last week reiterated Israel 's refusal to deal with the Palestine Liberation Organization , which he called a group of " demented genocidists . " <P> It is the Palestinian issue that shows most clearly how the Carter Administration is moving more toward Arab than Israeli views , increasing the likelihood of a U.S.-Israeli clash despite the artificial joviality surrounding Begin 's recent U.S. visit . The U.S. now accepts the Arab argument-with softer qualifications than before-that Palestinians should be included in negotiations . Moreover , Washington is searching for some way to open a dialogue between the U.S. and Yasser Arafat 's P.L.O.-if the Palestinians are willing to accept the terms of an American push for peace .
