Union demands mil put heavy strain on Administration wage guidelines <P> Of all the challenges to the Carter Administration 's program to stop inflation , the most daunting is next year 's tidal wave of labor negotiations . Even before the President announced his program of voluntary wage-price restraints , the 1979 bargaining calendar looked rugged . Next year , contracts covering 3.7 million workers expire , compared with roughly 2 million in 1978 . In an era when industry is struggling to hold down costs and union members have seen inflation eating up their wage gains , the stage is set for confrontation . Says John Gentry , labor relations adviser to Alfred Kahn , the nation 's top inflation fighter : " Adding the guidelines to that lineup can only make bargaining more difficult . " <P> Crucial , too . For the moment , industry officials are going along with the price guideline , which calls for companies to hold price boosts half a percentage point below the average for 1976-77 . But their compliance is not likely to last if unions push wages and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guidelines . Says one Administration official : " Ninety percent of the program will depend on holding down wage increases . " Gentry adds : " Companies can agree to abide by the program now and always raise their prices later if things go bad . But a union that takes a three-year contract now under the guidelines would be locked in . " <P> Complicating the Administration 's problems are two other factors . One is that , in the words of Audrey Freedman , senior research associate of the nonprofit Conference Board , " the coming year opens a three-year bargaining cycle dominated by fear-on the part of all employees , union and nonunion alike-that inflation will overwhelm wage increases . " Thus union members think that they ought to get the biggest raises possible to protect themselves against an inexorable rise in prices . The Administration has sought to counter that fear by ballyhooing a proposal to Congress to grant income-tax rebates to workers whose wages rise slower than prices do . But Congressmen worry that such " real wage insurance " would be inordinately expensive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assurance that it will be in effect as they go to the bargaining table . <P> Second , the Administration 's relations with organized labor are at an abysmal low . Both union and Government insiders sum up the attitudes of President Carter and AFL-CIO Chief George Meany in four blunt words : " They hate each other . " Meany bitterly complains that the guidelines press down on wages more than on prices , and calls for mandatory controls on both . In the latest round of hostilities , Carter last week crossed Meany 's name off the list of Government-approved directors of the Communications Satellite Corp . ( COMSAT ) , which prompted Meany 's heir apparent , AFL-CIO Treasurer Lane Kirkland , to fire off a letter to Carter announcing his resignation from two Government advisory committees .
