txt Juan S. arrived in New York City with a few dollars and one battered suitcase . He was illiterate , untrained , and afraid . But he had hope . The island was behind him  --  Puerto Rico , where he had known poverty and unemployment . Now , Juan is going back to Puerto Rico after 30 bitter years on the United States mainland . Instead of hope and opportunity , he found racial discrimination , bad housing , poor education , crime , drug addiction , and few jobs . Juan is not just one man . He is thousands . The Puerto Rican Government estimated last year that 60,000 Puerto Ricans returned to the island for good . However , thousands of newcomers from the island ev2ry year keep the number of Puerto Ricans on the mainland at over 1.5 million  --  about ? 1 million of them in New York City Now a lawyer Santiago Grevi arrived from the , island 44 years ago , while still a teen-ager . Today he is a lawyer and one of five members of the New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is there , " says Commissioner Santiago Grevi , pointing to the Puerto Rican flag on his office wall , " But I have respect , affection , loyalty , and a moral commitment to this flag , " indicating the Stars and Stripe . Despite the many Puerto Ricans who are returning to the island , Mr. Grevi feels his hopeful attitude is shared by most who remain in New York City . " I have faith , " he said " that we will find our place in the mainstream of American life . " // *Puerto Ricans fight for place // Yet Puerto Ricans here face formidable obsta  --  les . For example : ? In mid-1970 the unemployment rate for them in New York was 9.5 percent , corn-pared with 6,5 percent for blacks and 4.8 percent for all New Yorkers . ? Two thirds of Puerto Rican men in poverty areas hold unskilled or semiskilled jobs , double the figure for all the male workers in New York . ? Almost 16 percent of Puerto Ricans here live in substandard housing . The figure for whites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Less than 2 percent of Puerto Ricans own middle-class housing : ? The dropout rate for Puerto Ricans in New York schools is 70 percent . In some cities it is higher . Some hope offered In the face of all this , there are a number of encouraging developments .. Government and private agencies are working on the " education and job-opportunity situation . And the Puerto Ricans themselves are increasingly militant , in a constructive sense . " You are going to see more and more Puerto Ricans fighting for their rights , " says Mr. Grevi . A coalition of 75 Puerto Rican community groups is carrying out a consumer boycott of some dozen large New York concerns including A &P; Stores , Eastern Airlines , Madison Square Garden ' : NBC Television , and Pepsi Cola . The coordinator , Gilberto Gerena Valetin , asserts that Puerto RiCans spend every year about $4.5 billion in this city , " yet 20 percent of the work force is unemployed . " The boycotters are demanding that companies reaping a high percentage of their profits from the Puerto Rican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of community and municipal organizations are tackling the job situation , too . One is the Manpower and Career Development Agency ( MCDA ) , headed by a young Puerto Rican , Joseph R. Erazo . Its function is basically to train people for jobs and match them with suitable work . More than 50,000 serviced During the last eight months it has serviced some 56,000 persons , more than 21,000 of them Puerto Ricans . It currently has 8,475 persons in training , 3,399 of whom are Puerto Rican . However , Mr. Erazo admits that " the neediest people " are often left out , and most are Puerto ; Rican . This is because Puerto Ricans ? are often illiterate and most can not speak English Before they can enter a training program they must first be taught Spanish , then English . MCDA has some provision for this , but it shortly will be substantially increased by plugging in to the resources of the ' New York City Board of Education . Bilingual teachers , paid by the board , will come into MCDA programs and step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some Puerto Ricans point out that the next step  --  getting work ? is even tougher . Said one , " You train 100 bricklayers , plumbers , carpenters , and then you say they are ready . But the unions wo n't open the door . " MCDA is keenly aware of this obstacle and its consequences . So is Raymond Velez , who heads the Hunts Point Multi Service  --  which helps the South Bronx Puerto Rican community in almost every way from education to militant action . Constructipn jobs denied " There is currently $200 million worth of construction . going on in south Bronx , " he said , " and Puerto Ricans are largely denied the chance to work in these projects . " Failing to negotiate with the unions , Puerto Ricans have picketed and shut down some projects . " They will stay-closed-until Puerto Rican spokesmen can negotiate jobs and subcontracts for Puerto Ricans , " said Mr. Velez . Puerto Ricans are also negotiating at other construction sites . " If they negotiate in good faith , we will not picket , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bicultural programs are seen an important step in remedying the situa  --  tion . Some excellent - programs have developed in the last three years throughout the U.S. , but Mr. Badillo points out that they affect only 3 percent of Puerto Ricans . Mr. Velez thinks Puerto Ricans here need more political muscle . He reckons in ' the near future they will be a much stronger political force , if they can be persuaded to register . Right now he and others are conducting a massive campaign . Mr. Velez feels that even if Puerto Ricans themselves are not elected they will be able to affect the vote enough in some areas for the candidates to pay some attention to their needs .
