" This must be the most virtuous of all possible conventions , " declared Chief Predictor Hachiro Asano as 100 crack fortunetellers from Japan , South Korea , Hong Kong and India assembled in Seoul for a three-day meeting that ended last week . Drinking and sex were explicitly barred because , as Asano explained , " We must remain pure " for important responsibilities-that is , agreeing on answers to ten of the world 's weightiest questions . <P> The second International Predictors ' Conference , like last year 's first such get-together in Tokyo , also gave Asia 's various astrologers , palmists , bamboo-stick readers and other diviners a chance to understand one another at last . " Fortunetellers are like physicians , " Asano explained to TIME Correspondent S. Chang . " You might specialize in one branch , but you do n't qualify as a professional unless you have a working knowledge of them all . " Fortunetelling in fact is one of the more respected professions in Asia . Practitioners make up to $1,000 a month in Japan , and $500 in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stock market and horse races or suggestions on marital problems . <P> In Seoul each haruspex plied his specialty . There were no packs of cards to read ( " That seems awfully amateurish to us , " said Asano ) or crystal balls ( " That 's a fake " ) . Instead , the astrologers cast horoscopes , the bamboo-stick men studied hoigaku , the science of directions . Asano 's specialty is physiognomy or face reading ( he is the author of the Japanese bestseller Faces Never Tell a Lie ) . Consulting recent photographs of President Nixon he found that the space between eyes and eyebrows had grown auspiciously longer ; meanwhile , once cold eyes had assumed remarkable warmth . George McGovern 's mouth , however , was a disaster-too weak and narrow for a winner . Asano reconfirmed his diagnosis with palmistry . Sure enough , enlarged photos of the Nixon hands showed an unmistakably straighter head line , which begins between the thumb and index finger and runs across the palm . <P> On the convention 's last working afternoon the group assembled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We searched our souls while we worked , softly talked to ourselves and often felt the weight of the world heavily on our shoulders , " said Asano . " We hold ourselves collectively responsible for the outcome of all predictions . " All 100 agreed unanimously that : <P> &gt;Nixon will win the 1972 presidential election with 50% of the popular vote . <P> &gt; The Democrats will win the presidency in 1976 . <P> &gt; Divided countries like Germany , Korea and Viet Nam will be reunified within ten years . <P> &gt; Talks between North and South Korea on the reunion of separated families will be successfully concluded by 1974 . <P> &gt; In that year there will be a calamitous series of natural disasters in Asia . <P> &gt; In 1984 there will be a great flood in Eastern Europe that will claim thousands of lives . <P> &gt; By the end of the 1980s a " spiritually oriented age will replace the present materialistically oriented age .
