THE FIRST FOUR YEARS by Laura Ingalls Wilder . 134 pages . Harper &; Row . $4.95 . <P> <P> Some 40 years ago , an elderly lady sat down in a farmhouse on the edge of the Missouri Ozarks and wrote a book about her frontier childhood in the 1870s . Warm and straightforward , full of detail , Little House in the Big Woods was followed by seven more volumes-only slightly disguised as fiction - that carried the heroine . Laura Ingalls , to the point of marriage with Almanzo Wilder . Collectively and individually , all the books have become classics of children 's literature . It is safe to say that they have given a notion of what pioneer life was like to far more Americans than ever heard of Frederick Jackson Turner . <P> Laura Ingalls Wilder died in 1957 at age 90 . But she left behind the manuscript of yet another Little House book , or at least the extended draft for one . Written out like the others in longhand in orange-covered school notebooks , it was found among her papers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their first four years of married life . To Wilder fans , its publication can be considered as an unexpected gift from the past . <P> No doubt part of the constantly increasing sales of the Little House series ( more than 2,000,000 so far ) is accounted for by grandmothers and indulgent aunts bearing gifts . The books are standard stock ( along with E.B. White , The Wizard of Oz and Dr. Seuss ) in virtually every U.S. bookstore with a children 's section . The publisher , Harper &; Row , reports receiving upwards of 3,000 fan letters a year ( which they answer with a form letter originally prepared by Mrs. Wilder ) . <P> Writing about the olden days , Laura Wilder quickly snares all the incipient " how-to " book readers in her audience . A half dozen or so pages into Little House in the Big Woods , she is telling how Pa made a smokehouse out of a hollow tree to cure venison . She also describes cheese making , sod breaking , sugaring off , housebuilding ( log , sod and frame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practical matters . She offers assorted facts on such subjects as homestead law , horse breaking and how to manage a hoop skirt . The odd word may mystify ( pieplant , claim shack , prove out , picket pin , beholden , boughten ) , but the prose is straightforward enough for Hemingway . <P> Nor is there any artificiality about the plotting . Plots , in fact , are so seasonally repetitive and events so frequently domestic a few readers , boys especially , find the books a drag . What drama there is comes from the constant onslaughts of nature . Beginning in the Wisconsin forests . Laura , her sisters and their parents trek west by wagon into Kansas ( Little House on the Prairie ) , then up to Minnesota ( On the Banks of Plum Creek " ) and finally west again to South Dakota , beset along the way by grasshopper plagues , blizzards , rivers in spate and midsummer droughts that " cook the grains in the milk . " Treated with a minimum of sentimentalizing ( less and less in the later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , the Ingallses ' frontier life comes through as an intermittently brutal testing process . Scarlet fever blinds Sister Mary : blackbirds eat the corn crop : the family is snowbound for months and nearly starves ( The Long Winter ) .
