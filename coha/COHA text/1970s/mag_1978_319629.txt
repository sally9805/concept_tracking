The Economy To the Editors : <P> When will we value the N.G.P. ( national growth of people ) over the G.N.P. ? I fear not until we run out of the means of perpetuating our cherished consumption economy . Your article " Trying to Build Confidence " Jan. 30 implied that a healthy , happy America buys , buys , buys everything business sells , sells , sells . Laury Kohlenbrener Madison , Wis . <P> Cutting taxes while offering a deficit budget is no way to strengthen the dollar or to achieve economic stability . <P> Anyone who believes that more spending with reduced income will cure inflation must be a peanut head ! <P> Harvie Barnard Tacoma , Wash . <P> So $500.2 billion is " a tight budget " ? Only a $60.6 billion deficit ? In 1959 President Eisenhower presented our first $100 billion budget ; people were outraged . Now , hardly a whimper is heard as Jimmy Carter quintuples that expenditure . <P> Michael Auerbach Waterford , Conn . <P> He mentioned it many times during the campaign , but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did we find out what Jimmy Carter really meant by zero-base budgeting . <P> K. Harold Sankman Skokie , III . <P> Italy 's Protest Vote Italy 's Protest Vote As a European-oriented democratic socialist , I understand American apprehension at the mounting power of the Communist Party Jan. 23 . My question , however , is : Do you Americans think that one-third of the Italian electorate has just gone crazy in voting for the Communists , or do you think there must be a reason for this massive protest ? <P> After World War II , Italy 's society underwent a forced industrialization that has made it pass from a backward agricultural Mediterranean country to a major industrial power in the West . At what cost did all this happen ? <P> Italy is now a sagging , corrupt , crisis-ridden industrial country where all-and I mean all-social problems have been left unsolved and ignored . Our society , especially the young people ( now accused of being monsters ) , has become fully aware that all our hard work returns nothing in the way of jobs , better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italians do n't want another dictatorship . We want freedom , but we care about what we do n't get from democracy . <P> Paolo Roccatani Rome <P> After World War II , the U.S. and Russia wanted to keep the status quo in their zones of influence . But Russia has been more aggressive and has tried everything to increase its power and diminish America 's . America wants the status quo in Italy ; Russia does not . Although the Communists in Italy are preaching freedom , justice and equality , the Russians do not care whether there is peace , prosperity or justice in Italy , or a civil war or misery . What matters is to gain power , especially against America . <P> Angela Bertolo Pordenone , Italy <P> Homosexuality and the Clergy <P> Those watching the Presbyterians ' debate on " Homosexuality and the Clergy " Jan. 30 may find it easier to understand how modern-day liberal theologians support homosexuality if they realize that those theologians deny that the Bible , in its entirety , is God 's word . Once they reject the authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis to claim the Bible 's authority in other areas as well .
