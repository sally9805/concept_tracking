When the U.S.S.R. 's most popular novelist , Mikhail Sholokhov , won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1965 , he was acclaimed by the Swedish Academy for " the artistic force and integrity " of his four-part classic The Quiet Don . This week his fellow Nobel prizewinner , Alexander Solzhenitsyn , accused Sholokhov of plagiarism in a preface to a critical study of The Quiet Don* published in Paris . Solzhenitsyn declared that the real author of the epic tale of Don Cossacks in World War I and the Russian civil war was Fyodor Kryukov , a Cossack writer . <P> Kryukov is known to have written a massive work entitled The Quiet Don . <P> Kryukov 's manuscript , however , somehow mysteriously disappeared when he died in the civil war in 1920 at the age of 50 . Solzhenitsyn believes that Sholokhov obtained Kryukov 's manuscript a few years later and passed it off as his own-with some politically necessary but stylistically clumsy modifications . <P> He theorizes that since Kryukov , a White officer in the civil war , had written sympathetically of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Red cause and introduce Bolshevik heroes into the novel . <P> This , Solzhenitsyn writes , would explain the unevenness of the work . <P> Solzhenitsyn , now living in exile in Zurich , notes that Sholokhov , a former laborer and clerk with scarcely any education , was only 23 years old when he published the first volume in 1928 . Yet , Solzhenitsyn points out , " the book reveals the kind of literary power attainable only after many attempts by an experienced and accomplished writer . " He also joins many critics in observing that Sholokhov 's other fiction ( Seeds of Tomorrow , Harvest on the Don ) is strikingly inferior to The Quiet Don , which was completed in 1940 . It became the best-selling Soviet novel in the U.S.S.R. ( 6 million copies translated into 40 different Soviet languages ) , and Soviet textbooks extol it as the supreme literary accomplishment of Communism . The book continues to be widely read in Soviet schools . <P> Solzhenitsyn 's charge will doubtless prove embarrassing to the leaders in the Kremlin , where the 69-year-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cultural hardliners . In recent years , Sholokhov has frequently denounced liberal writers ; in 1969 he characterized Solzhenitsyn as a " Colorado beetle " who deserved extermination as a noxious plant pest . <P> Solzhenitsyn 's allegation that The Quiet Don is mostly the work of an anti-Communist brings into the open a long-smoldering rumor that Sholokhov is a plagiarist . Reports that Sholokhov had plagiarized the novel were so widespread in 1929 that Pravda threatened to prosecute the " malicious slanderers . " When Stalin later declared Sholokhov to be " the great writer of our tune , " any discussion of the novel 's true authorship became extremely dangerous . But the controversy would not die . In 1967 Russian Poet Andrei Voznesensky publicly recited an unpublished poem in Moscow that clearly alluded to Sholokhov : <P> <P> You , superclassic and henchman , You ought to be ashamed ; You once copied another man 's novel , But you could n't repeat the performance . <P>
