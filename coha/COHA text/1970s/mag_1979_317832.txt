But Ronald was also in Washington , and running hard <P> Big John , the slick Texan , swept into Washington last week and turned on his charm to sell his most cherished product : himself . Although John Connally 's audience included more than 100 skeptical members of the National Press Gallery , even the clinking coffee cups were silenced . Still handsome and imposing despite the pounding of a topsy-turvy political career , Connally was in command . <P> First he injected a touch of understated humor : " I 've been coming to this city in one capacity or another for nearly 40 years , and I 'm beginning to like the place . Would n't mind living here , in fact . " ( Laughter . ) The smile faded . Next came a moment of graciousness : " I believe President Carter is a sincere , patriotic , hard-working man who wants very much to have a successful Administration . " ( A pause . ) " But these qualities are insufficient to provide effective leadership . " <P> The voice got louder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong for the times in which we live . It has little sense of strategy , and little sense of the use of power on a global scale . " Finally , the point of the speech : " I am today announcing my candidacy for the Republican nomination for President of the United States . " <P> As his handling of the announcement demonstrated , John Connally , 61 , is at the peak of his formidable oratorical powers , after a career that included stints as Governor of Texas , Secretary of the Navy in the Kennedy Administration , Secretary of the Treasury under President Nixon and even as a defendant ( eventually acquitted ) in a Watergate-era bribery trial . He thus became the first major Republican to announce his candidacy for President in a field that may bloom to ten before the primary-election season opens in New Hampshire . <P> Even as Connally made his big move , his chief competitors were also in Washington , using a meeting of the Republican National Committee as the occasion to rush through a series of cocktail parties , private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other . Eight announced or likely candidates visited the capital in four days . <P> Among them was George Bush , 54 , a former Congressman , CIA director and U.S. envoy to Peking , who likes to be described as " the thinking man 's candidate . " Said he : " Call me a conservative , but one with compassion . " Bush lunched with G.O.P. Congressmen , breakfasted with reporters and made a low-key speech in Georgetown . <P> The favorite of many committee members is Ronald Reagan , who is readily conceded by all competitors to be the front runner . Considering the ill fortune of such past early leaders as Republican George Romney in 1968 and Democrat Edmund Muskie in 1972 , Connally said of Reagan : " I do not envy his position . "
