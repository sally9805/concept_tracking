txt President Carter 's position on the eve of the Camp David summit is that there must be substantive progress on " some aspects " of basic , underlying problems relating to the West Bank ? together with putting the negotiating processes back into place . The top-level administration view is that anything less than some substantive gains on questions relating to the application of UN Resolution 242 to the West Bank ? the settlements . Israeli withdrawal , and the future of the Palestinians ? will likely be perceived by the public as failure . But the mood in the White House , as the parties prepare to sit down together at Camp David for this crucial conference . is said to be one of - guarded optimism . " This is a shift away from the expressions of pessimism that U.S. officials were earlier using in describing their summit expectations . Now the " mix " required for the summit to be a " success " ? some substantive progress and restorati of the negotiation processes ? is being described as a " possibility . " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ official United States assessment of the " minimum " that must be forthcoming from the summit to avert the appearance that " nothing " came out of it . Earlier the restoration of negotiation processes was understood to be that " minimum . // From sa.e 1 Carter wants some West Bank progress Then , just a few days ago , an administration Official was calling it the maximum that could be expected . And now there is this new , official U.S. goal of substantive progress on West Bank issues which is stated to be within possible reach . Further , it is known that in the Carter view anything less than this might well have these results : ? For President Carter , it could well signal the end of the United States 's ability to play a useful role in seeking to restore peace in the Mideast . Also it could cause him further damage in the polls . ? For Egyptian President Anwar al-Sadat , it would be a disaster . He would likely move very rapidly to salvage his position by adopting a militant policy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress at Camp David would be much less damaging . Actually , it could strengthen him in the eyes of the majority of the Israelis if the result is seen as stemming directly from Mr. Begin 's pursuing a hard , resistant line . However , such a result might well lose Mr. Begin the support of many American Jews ( as well as more Israelis ) if they see him as having been mainly responsible for dashing any prospects of making use of the earlier Sadat peace initiative and , possibly , moving the Mideast toward war . Within the newly enunciated , more expectant administration view of the summit , there is this note of caution : No one should expect that the West Bank problem can be resolved at this meeting . But the resolving of " aspects " of this problem now appears to be within potential grasp . At the same time the prospects that the U.S. will propose that it will provide a " presence " on the West Bank as a means of helping to resolve that question seems much less likely than just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ described as " vastly premature . " It remains an option ? although an unlikely one . Again , Mr. Sadat is seen as the one who must have something " substantive " out of the conference . ' He is viewed as the most vulnerable of the parties and the one who must be able to show something for coming here .
