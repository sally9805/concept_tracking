txt Gov . Ella T. Grasso today ordered a new investigation into the 1973 murder of Barbara Gibbons and requested an inquiry into the prosecution of murder charges against Mrs. Gibbons 's son , Peter A. Reilly . The case against the 21-year-old youth was dropped Wednesday after the new State 's Attorney for Litchfield County announced that he had found evidence tending to clear the youth in the files of his predecessor . " In ViCW of the action of the court in the Peter Reilly case , I have directed Commissioner Edward P. Leonard to have the state police reopen the investigation of the Barbara Gibbons murder case , " Mrs. Grasso said in a statement that was read at the Capitol in Hartford while the Governor was away at her weekend home . " In addition , I have referred to Chief State 's Attorney Joseph T. Gormley Jr . questions raised concerning the use of evidence in this case , " Mrs. Grasso said in the statement , which ended her yearlong refusal to become involved in the case . In 1971 , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentenced to a 6-to-16-year prison term . But then , in a dramatic turnaround earlier this year , he won a new trial . Tonight lie was pleased with the news . " It 's about time , it 's really about time that something was done , " he said . " 1 did n't know if it would happen or not , I 'm really pleased . " He added that he " and the people of the State of Connecticut all deserve to know who killed my mother ? I 'm very happy , 1 wish it had happened three years ago . " Mr. Reilly 's case won nationwide attention earlier this year after the playwright Arthur Miller became convinced that the youth was being railroaded on the strength of a coerced confession . Mr. Miller enlisted the aid of The New York Times , which published articles based on its own investigation of the case . Mr. Reilly 's attorney and some of his chief supporters were less sanguine than he was that the Governor 's statement would , in fact , lead to the discovery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to be prosecuted despite the existence for three years of evidence placing him miles from the scene of the crime at the time it was committed . Their doubts were sharpened by the announcement earlier in the day by Mr. Gormley that he had no intention of investigating the prosecution of Mr. Reilly by the former Litchfield County State 's Attorney , John F. Bianchi , who died earlier this year . Mr. Gormley , who is an officer of the Superior Court , is not responsible to the Governor . lie has only vaguely defined authority over Connecticut 's eight State 's At torneys . " It is almost , impossible now to reconstruct what happened over two years ago , or determine what the motivation might have been , " he said in his statement earlier . " John Bianchi is not here to defend himself . " On Wednesday , State 's Attorney Dennis A. Santoro presented statements he said he found in Mr. Bianchi 's files in which an auxiliary state policeman , Frank Finney , and his wife , Wanda , said they saw Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P.M. on Sept. 28 , 1973 , the night Mrs. Gibbons was killed . Defense attorneys argued that this meant Mr. Reilly could not have had enough time to kill his mother at the time the police said he had . Mr. Gormley said tonight he wanted to look into whether Mr. Reilly 's attorney during his trial knew of the Finneys ' statement and whether Mr. Bianchi planned to call the couple as witnesses . the Associated Press reported . It is known that Mr. Bianchi had placed Mr. Finney under subpoena , Mr. Gormley said . " I really don't. believe John Bianchi would consciously withhold evidence that . he thought would be advantageous to the defense , " lie said . Mr. Reilly 's attorney , T. F. Gilroy Daly , praised the Governor 's move as " a step in the right direction " but said he favored naming a special prosecutor and a blueribbon panel to investigate the case . " I 've got awfully serious reservations about the state police investigating the state police , " he said .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
