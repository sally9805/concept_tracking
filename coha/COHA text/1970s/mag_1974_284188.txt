Even as guns fell silent on the Golan Heights , hostile political shelling within Israel threatened to cut short the life of its budding new government . Factional bitterness and personal acrimony over the choice of Premier-designate Yitzhak Rabin 's new 19-member coalition Cabinet have clouded prospects for his long-term success . A thin majority of the 120-member Knesset ( Parliament ) will probably approve Rabin this week as the country 's fifth and youngest ( 52 ) Premier. * Nonetheless , many observers believe that new elections , perhaps later this year , must come if Rabin is to secure the mandate he needs to provide Israel with effective leadership . <P> The commander of Israel 's forces in the 1967 Six-Day War and a former Ambassador to Washington , Rabin was selected by a Labor Party Central Committee as Premier-designate after Golda Meir announced her resignation last April 11 . Although widely respected by Israeli voters , Rabin has antagonized some members of the Labor establishment by excluding members of the dominant Mapai faction of the Labor Party from important Cabinet posts . <P> Arab Tilt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rabin 's old comrade-in-arms Yigal Allon , 55 , becomes Foreign Minister as well as continuing as Deputy Premier , while former Transport and Communications Minister Shimon Peres , 51 , takes over Defense from Moshe Dayan . But Rabin has appointed others , including five newcomers , who may tilt Israel 's new government toward more flexible dealings with Arab nations . Perhaps his most controversial Cabinet choice is Mrs. Shulamit Aloni , 45 , head of the dovish Citizens Rights Movement , who advocates the return of most occupied Arab lands in exchange for a Middle East peace accord . Mrs. Aloni 's appointment as Minister Without Portfolio makes her the second woman to serve in an Israeli government . <P> Two other leading Labor stalwarts also rejected offers to serve under the new Premier . Abba Eban , 59 , who has feuded with Rabin ever since his appointment as Ambassador to Washington in 1968 , was enraged when the Premier-designate offered the Foreign Ministry to Allon . Rubbing salt in the wound , Rabin offered Eban the Minister of Information folio , a lesser Cabinet job that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sapir , 65-the kingmaker of the Labor Party-flatly refused to stay hi his post . According to Rabin 's foes , Sapir even cautioned his chosen successor , Banking Executive Yaacov Levinson , not to accept the Finance portfolio because Sapir believes that the new government will not survive for more than two months . Nor has departing Golda Meir gone out of her way to bolster Rabin 's cause . Since he was neither a dyed-in-the-wool Mapai man nor an experienced politician , she was cool to his selection as the new Premier-designate and did not attend all of the Labor Party meetings at which the makeup of the new government was discussed .
