txt The part of New York City that never really belonged despairs over the city 's fiscal fiasco . Staten Island fears it is going to get it In me neck . It 's been the same for decades . Whenever Manhattan runs the city into a hole , some political quarterback comes up with the old Statue of Liberty play  --  raise the fares on the Staten Island Ferry . Even tho an increase ca n't keep New York afloat , such suggestions propel Staten Island 's politicians into a battle in which they have to expend practically all of their feeble clout just to save the famous nickel fare . NOW THE STATE 'S legislators in Albany have told Mayor Abe Beame he can increase his revenue with things like taxes on movies , a 12-cent a gallon levy on beer , and raising the ferry fare to 25 cents a round trip . Any of those solutions would cause at least emotional pain on Staten Island , the New York City borough outsiders rarely see except from airliners or the far end of a boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Absolutely , " said Al Seton , a retired naval officer who is now a Staten Island civic leader . He notes that for a Staten Islander commuting to Manhattan , the ferry is just a conne .. iVon between two other fares-33 cents for a bus or train on the island and 35 cents for a subway or bus in Manhattan , or - 75 cents each way . A BROOKLYN resident can commute on the subway all the way to the Bronx , thru all of Manhattan , for 35 cents . " If you 're one of the nuts who do it , you can ride all day on the New York subways for 35 cents , " Seton said . Legally , Staten Island is as much a part of New York City as Manhattan , Brooklyn , the Bronx , and Queens  --  the five counties which merged in 1898 to form the present city . GEOLOGICALLY , IT 'S part of New Jersey . The Arthur Kill separating it from Jersey is only a mile wide , while Manhattan is at the other end of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really belonged to the city . Islanders do n't think of themselves as New Yorkers . When they say " New York " they mean Manhattan . Staten Island might have seceded long ago except there 's no place to go except Jersey , which has many of New York 's bad qualities and few of its good . Its 58 square miles make it larger in area than Manhattan and the Bronx , smaller than Brooklyn or Queens , but the population is only 300,000 , making the island a political midget compared with the 11/2 to 21/2 million masses of the other boroughs . NEW YORK 'S financial problems have left Islanders with greater happiness they 're not on the other side of the bay and the numb expectation that they 'll have to pay for New York 's troubles . The nickel fare has been fixed by law for 70 years and dates to the last century . Indeed , it 's said to be lower than the sixpence the British charged when they launched the ferry service in 1700 . The nickel fare has been maintained , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's greatest subsidies . The ferries cost the city about 60 cents a passenger to operate , so it loses 55 cents on each of the 20 million plus passengers a year  --  a total of 512 million a year . THE LEGISLATURE In Albany has suggested to Beame it would go along with him If he decides to pick up a few millions of the billions the city needs by raising the ferry fare . All the city would have to do would be to switch the turnstiles in Manhattan from a dime to a quarter per round trip . The city tried to save $1 million a year recently by taking off one of the five ferries . Because of the fear that rush-hour service would have been cut so much islanders would be climbing the terminal walls , Staten Island Borough President Bob Connor got the cut delayed at least temporally . Connor said the reduction would be " totally retrogressive and would threaten the entire service . He said it would eliminate only 32 jobs out of the city total of 348,000 . " I WO N'T @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut the  --  fat instead of the muscle in the city 's marine and aviation division , " Connor said . " I ca n't see why they need 500 employes to run just five boats . " A few years ago the city eliminated one boat to save money and a reporter for the Staten Island newspaper , the Advance , found it on standby . fully manned , engines running . The only economy was the cost of accelerating moss tile bay . Staten Islanders ' attachment to the 5-cent fare is social as well aireconomic . In their notsorsubconscious is the belief that the ferry is unfare fate the only thing the island ever got from " New York " and the suspicion that the Big Apple is always scheming to take it away . ISLANDERS SAY they do n't expect much in the way of city services . " The only time city hall pays any attention to us is when there 's some deal to exploit us , " one said . " Especially now , when we have the city 's only undeveloped land . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aplenty . But some of that green is above wasteland  --  ancient dumps where people dig for bottles and swamps fed by sewage effluent . " ONLY PART OF the Island has sewers and runoff from septic tanks trickles into swamps . A decade ago scores of houses burned in a brush fire when the firemen did n't have enough city water for their hoses . And islanders complain that burglars from all over New York prey on Staten Island without getting caught . The island leans toward the Right politically , a disadvantage when it comes to dealing with liberal Manhattan . Former Mayor John Lindsay was regarded as a radical and people threw beer on him at a Staten Island picnic . Tourists from other lands seem to enjoy the 5-cent ferry ride past the Statue of Liberty , but Staten Island commuters think it 's merely one leg of an uncomfortable , boring , 11/4 hour long commute to Manhattan . BUT FOR MOST Islanders , there 's nothing yet to take the place of the ferry . The city has created a $1-a-ride express bus service to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10-year-old Verrazzano Bridge to Brooklyn , then over an expressway to the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel into Manhattan . Islanders suspected a plot to displace the ferry . But , they soon discovered that the expressway between the bridge and tunnel had been planned to bring in hordes of Long Islanders at one point and later to provide an exit for motorists who want to avoid the 70-cent tunnel toll by using the free Brooklyn Bridge to get to Manhattan . The result is a long traffic jam every morning . The express service was to roar up Manhattan 's East River expressway , but that also is jammed . And the antique West Side drive is closed to keep vehicles from crashing thru the elevated pavement . Now the " express " buses struggle street-by-street thru crowded Manhattan . It 's obviously no threat to the ferry but it has hardly improved Staten Island 's opinion of New York .
