txt For the small-business man who plans to borrow money , there is good news : A growing number of banks are cutting their interest rates on small-business loans . There is Just one hitch : A lot of people think that few businesses are going to get those cut-rate loans . " I think it 's a lot of flag-waving with very little substance for small business . " says Dean Treptow , president of Brown Deer Bank in Brown Deer , Wis. , a holdout from the trend . Many bankers , analysts and businessmen agree with Mr. Treptow that the rate-cutting is more smoke than fire . The bargain rates began in Pittsburgh . where Mellon Bank announced in November that any company with total assets of less than $L5 million could qualify for loans at a rate 1 ' 4 percentage points below what it would normally pay . Craig Ford , a senior vice president at Mellon , says the special rates were initiated " because we were hearing that small business was getting into problems " handling costs brought on by soaring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the floodgates . Since then , at least 80 banks have followed suit . It is likely that more will go along . The Small Business Administration in Washington has been aggressively cam- ? paigning for the program and even gave Mellon an award for its efforts . Federal Reserve Chairman G. William Miller has also praised the rate plan , saying last November that he was " pleased to see " it and " would encourage it . " While the rate reductions differ , the various plans revolve around the idea of two prime . or minimum , lending rates  --  one for larger customers and a lower one for small businesses . Since small-business customers usually pay a rate scaled up from prime , they can save money by scaling up from a pared rate . For those who have received them , the lower-cost loans are a blessing . " It is an absolute necessity , " says William Anderson . president of Matrix Inc. of Providence . R.I. Mr. Anderson recently obtained a $75,000 working-capital loan at 1114% from a local bank . If the bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been 1244% . Most people agree , however , that Mr. Anderson is likely to be the exception rather than the rule . It may be too early to tell - the programs are still in their infancy and no figures are available  --  but these critics say that a variety of conditions attached to the loans severely limit the potential market . The Size Limitation Size is one . Most of the plans are being announced by big-city banks , says one Midwest banker , " and they jug do n't make many loans to the size company covered by the plans . " ( The maximum net worth allowed under the plans varies from 1250.000 to $1 million , with maximum assets ranging from about $500,000 to $1.5 million . ) Even if a small business does meet the size criteria , other obstacles exist . " What happens is that they make the restrictions so tight that nobody is going to qualify for it , " says Edward Asbury. president of Asbury Industries Inc. of Murrysville . Pa. , a company that has had difficulty getting financing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equipment , who was recently turned down for a loan at a bank with a small-business prime : " They use a million excuses as to why you do n't come up to snuff as far as their credit standards are concerned . " He says , for instance , that his outstanding level of debt and his plans for using the money were looked upon with disfavor , even though he bad no problem getting a loan in the past under the same conditions . Certainly the cut-rate loans go against the grain of many bankers . " It really smacks against everything I know about banking , " says Clarence Barksdale , chairman and chief executive officer of First Union Bancorp. , a St. Louis-based bank-holding company . " A large company that is more known to the market should have better credit , " he says , and that is the way things continue to be at First Union Bancorp . Remember 1973 ? If these arguments sound a little familiar , it is n't surprising ; as one West Coast banker says . " we 've seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when the Committee on Interest and Dividends , part of President Nixon 's wage-price stabilization program , set up guidelines encouraging banks to establish a dual prime system . Most banks did so . The consensus is that the dual prime was of little help to small business then . " You just did n't see the banks making any loans last time , " says J. Richard Fredericks , a partner at Montgomery Securities Inc. , a San Francisco research concern . Many bankers agree . " I made a few loans at lower rates for the guy who was really struggling , " a Cincinnati banker says , " but I sure did n't make many . I felt there was no logic to It . " This time around , he adds , he is n't going to go to a dual prime unless forced to . Fears that banks may be forced to  --  or at least be given guidelines as in 1973 ? are ? recarded by many as having prompted the voluntary moves . " As soon as the news of the wageprice guidelines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " a Federal Reserve economist says . " I see their action as largely a political move . " Some of the bankers who have set up a dual prime concede they were motivated by political concerns . " It 's a smart maneuver , " says an executive at one such bank in Pittsburgh , not Mellon . " Instead of having them come in and dictate it . we figured it 's better to do it ourselves . " Voluntarism may also have been motivated by a desire to diffuse the political heat over the prime rate itself , which now stands at 11$4% at most banks and 11,4% at a few . " The banks have been trying to get away from the prime rate ? it 's an albatross , " says Paul Nadler , professor of finance at Rutgers University . Adds a Southwest banker who is toying with the idea of going to a dual prime : " When we do break I the all-time high of ; 12% , you can be sure that nobody is going to be pointing the guilty finger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be blaming us . " By having a lower prime to display , this banker says , he may be able to ward off some of the public antagonism that inevitably comes from a prime-rate increase . " They kill two birds with one stone , " a New York banking analyst says . " They appease the regulators and politicians , and they come off looking like champions to small business . It 's a great publicity ploy , and all they have to do is give out a minimal amount of loans . " Such criticism rankles proponents of the dual prime . " The notion that this is some sort of preemptive strike is naive , " says Milton D. Stewart , the Small Business Administration 's chief counsel for advocacy . " You just ca n't preempt that sort of thing by voluntary action . The whole point is to keep down the general run of interest rates for small business , and banks that can afford to do this should . " Price Impact Seen In turn , Mr. Stewart adds , small businesses will find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boyce , president of Microbac Laboratories in Pittsburgh , says the smallbusiness prime worked that way for him . He says that his chemical-testing concern was able to cut 2'i to 3% off its bid price for a water and waste-water analysis project because of a small-business loan from Mellon Bank . " I hear it 's been scoffed at , " Mr. Boyce says , " but for us , that 1,4 percentage points really made a difference . " His firm was awarded the $55,000 contract . Most bankers who have adopted the dual prime say the scoffing Is more a knee-jerk reaction than an ? intelligent response . " These critics just love to put down any display of corporate altruism , " a Boston banker says . " Why ca n't they just accept this as it is ? " Mr. Ford of Mellon adds : " For a market like Pittsburgh , we think it 's an important thing to keep these people going . Sometimes I feel like putting on a white hat and saying that it represents a reduction of profits on our part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mellon Bank , a unit of Mellon National Corp .. says that most of its cut-rate loans have been to existing customers and that the bank does n't expect this program alone to increase its market share of such business . Some proponents say that even if not many loans are made , the dual prime is worthwhile as a symbol . " I feel it 's very important in that big banks are recognizing the value of small business and the plethora of problems it faces in inflationary times , " says Robert Lee . president of Hotwatt Inc. of Danvers , Mass. , a maker of electrical appliances . Problem of Availability Where the advocates and cntics agree is that the dual prime is unlikely to solve the No. 1 problem facing small businesses ? raising cash , at whatever price , during a credit crunch . " The availability of money is more of a concern to me than the cost , " says William Grady , owner of Elmbrook Refrigeration Inc. of Brookfield . Wis . " If interest rates go down , I can always renegotiate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just have to put off buying and watch inflation eat up any savings I might receive from getting a lower interest rate . " At the moment , the big-city banks , which have dominated the small-business-prime programs , still have plenty of cash to lend . But a lot of the smaller banks , where many small businesses get their cash , are feeling a squeeze . According to a survey of the 500,000 small businesses in the National Federation of Independent Business , the proportion of borrowing firms reporting that loans were harder to get rose to 31% in January from 24% in October . The increase , says Prof. William Dunkelberg of Purdue University , indicates that banks have " substantially increased the incidence of credit rationing and that other lending terms are tightening . " One such bank is Omaha National Bank . " We 're loaned up to the eyeballs , " says F. Donald Lewis , vice president . As a result , Mr. Lewis says , his bank ca n't afford to have a small-business prime . " We only have a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customer is n't going to get any unless he pays more , " he says . If money gets tight all over , he adds , " these banks that have the small-business rates are going to , have to get back to basic banking . "
