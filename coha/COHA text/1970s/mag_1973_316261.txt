THERE was never much doubt that France 's legislative elections would be a sharp setback for the party that President Georges Pompidou inherited from Charles de Gaulle four years ago . <P> The question was how much the Gaullists ' recent weakness in the public opinion polls would change the National Assembly , which they had controlled for well over a decade . As the voters went to the polls for this week 's first-round balloting , there were no clear answers . <P> Runoff . Though nothing would be certain until next week 's second-round runoff , there was a good chance that the Gaullists would hang on to a slim majority , but it was also possible that they would be forced to seek a coalition with the small centrist parties- or even lose control of the Assembly al together to the first leftist coalition since the Popular Front of the 1930s . What ever the results , the Gaullists have al most certainly lost the license , which they had exercised for the past 15 years , to speak for all of France . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidates were competing for 490 seats - an average of more than six candidates per district . The full extent of the damage to the commanding 365-seat bloc that the Gaullists and their al lies carried into the election will not be known until next week 's runoff. * But the pre-election opinion polls continued to suggest that Gaullist losses to the left-wing alliance of Franois Mitterrand 's Socialists and Georges Marchais 's Communists would be heavy . The final poll , published by France-Soir , gave the So cialist-Communist combine and other leftist parties 47 per cent of the electorate . The Gaullists trailed with 36% ( as compared with their 46% popular vote in the 1968 elections ) ; the centrist parties , led by Publisher-Politician Jean-Jacques Servan-Schreiber and Rouen Mayor Jean Lecanuet , took 14% . By one reckoning , the Gaullists were assured of at least 225 seats , but there were no guarantees that they would pick up the 246 needed for a bare majority . <P> Though it was a crucial election , one that could prove every bit as momentous as the 1969 referendum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unmoved . As election day approached , some candidates found them selves speaking to nearly empty auditoriums and searching for hands to shake . Touring his home district in the wine country of Burgundy one day last week , Gaullist Minister Jean-Philippe Lecat , the Pompidou government 's official spokesman , drew crowds of two and three voters in some of the 15 towns and villages on his itinerary . <P> If the voters were unexcited , it was because the party leaders were uninspiring . Socialist Mitterrand , who is engaging in person but a stiff and weary figure on a TV screen , bored French audiences by repeatedly assuring them that the united-left program-nationalization of " strategic industries , " banks and insurance companies-is " neither socialism nor Communism " but something he described as " economic democracy . " Although many Frenchmen agree with Servan-Schreiber 's proposals for decentralizing power within France , few share his sense of urgency about spearheading " a European new deal .
