Airline Safety <P> To the Editors : <P> As an airline captain for one of our largest carriers , I congratulate you on doing a fair and factual piece on aviation safety April 11 . The machines have become as sound and foolproof as man can design-but man himself is the weak link . <P> Still stamped indelibly inside my forehead is what used to be on Navy ready-room walls- " Flying itself is not inherently dangerous , but like the sea , it is unmercifully unforgiving of human error . " <P> <P> Arthur Glowka Stamford , Conn . <P> <P> The blind can not lead the blind . No amount of regulations will ever substitute for good judgment . There should not have been double operations on that runway under that extremely limited visibility . <P> How many lives and how much money would be saved if airlines would lower schedule reliability by about 1% because of bad weather ? <P> Franklin T. ( " Hank " ) Kurt South Brooksville , Me . <P> <P> Will the little " black boxes " tell who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , the bombers of Las Palmas Airport already hold claim to that honor . <P> Bombers , hijackers , arsonists and kidnapers must accept responsibility for the effects of their actions . <P> <P> B. Holbert Manhattan , Kans . <P> <P> Your article " The Constant Quest for Safety " stated that one recommendation of an FAA panel to improve cabin safety is " giving crews better training for emergencies " and " making sure that flight attendants man the exit doors during a landing instead of frantically collecting cocktail glasses . " <P> Based on my experience as an American Airlines flight attendant for the past four years , I feel that I have been given and continue to be given excellent emergency training . Any time that I have " frantically " collected glasses before landing it has been because I had to argue with passengers who insisted on having the last sip and keeping the glass until the last possible moment . Flight attendants need the cooperation of passengers , who , for the most part , have come to take safety for granted . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report , a controller is forbidden to tell a pilot to " Hold for takeoff ' because the mere mention of " takeoff ' could trigger a response in the mind of the pilot and cause him to throw the throttles open prematurely , then what was the Tenerife controller doing saying , " Standby for takeoff clearance " ? <P> Robert B. Crim Naugatuck , Conn . <P> 1 simply can not understand why , in the name of the public 's right to know , you must infringe on personal suffering , shock and crisis by showing people 's agony in living ( or dying ) color . <P> Showing the burning plane is one thing , but photographing those devastated people is beyond the bounds of decency and respect . <P> Carol S. Michalec Newport News , Va . <P> <P> Back to the Indians <P> " Should We Give the U.S. Back to the Indians April 11 ? " That 's not the issue . The issue is whether other Americans are ready to take the Indians seriously . Indians are not demanding the U.S. back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often overlooked in the past . <P> Paul H.
