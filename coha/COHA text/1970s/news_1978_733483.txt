F12 LETTERS Geico To the Business Editor : In the " People " column Jan. 22 an article on Leo Goodwin Jr. , a former member of the Government Employees Insurance Company 's board of directors , states that " in the last few years , Geico has suffered financial difficulties . " Geico is no longer in financial difficulty . The company reported net income of $41.9 million through the first nine months of 1977 compared with a net loss for the same 1976 period of $34.3 million . The article also states , " Its stock .. . has slumped from more than $60 a share in November 1972 to less than $5 a share now . " Geico 's stock has not traded at less than $5 a share since the fourth quarter of 1976 . ROBERT W. JACKSON . Director , public information Government Employees Insurance Company Washington , Feb. 1 , 1978 Bicycles To the Business Editor : If American bicycle manufacturers can learn from the auto companies ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jan. 29 ) , perhaps they can also learn from the back-packing industry , for bicycles are to automobiles what back packs are to luggage : lighter , simpler , cheaper , more convenient , more fun ? " recreational " products which can break into larger , utilitarian markets and have done so . This is to suggest that the bicycle manufacturers have another boom on their hands , or more precisely , a time bomb . Considering that one out of every four dollars in the United States is spent , directly or indirectly , on automobiles , and that at least a fourth of all auto trips in the United States are easy hike trips ( less than four miles ) , it follows that approximately 25 cents out of every $4 could be spent on bicycles . These figures call for an OBEC , an " Organization of Bicycle Exporting Countries , " which would cooperate rather than compete with American manufacturers in the interest of meeting the demand for a healthier , more energy-efficient America . As cars and bicycles continue to compete for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that mopeds should lead the way in this second boom . For just as the back pack has overcome itself , as luggage that need n't be lugged , so the bicycle has begun to overcome its own limitations , first in the guise of the moped , and in a few years ( once adequate public transportation is restored ) , as the lightweight " transit bicycle " that folds , collapses , or compacts quickly while being taken onto trains and buses and into places of employment  --  the commuters ' private " taxi . " JOHN DOWLIN Secretary Greater Philadelphia Bicycle Coalition Philadelphia , Feb. 3 , 1978 Rationing To the Business Editor : Since our oil imports and consumption continue to rise despite more conservation measures and price increases , rationing of gasoline and possibly other petroleum products seems to be an ' inevitable step . In your " Washington Report " column on gasoline rationing on Feb. 5 , Steven Rattner quotes Energy Secretary Schlesinger as saying that any rationing plan is apt to break down because of corruption . This has been true in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World War 11 know how black marketing flourished then , creating new fortunes in the . hands of crooked meat dealers , etc . And gas rationing now would not be something with a forseeable end . The Federal Government would have to establishe severe , uncompromising and swift penalties for violations of rationing . If a few examples were quickly taken to the courts and well publicized , there would be a deterrent . In World War II , anyone who tried to evade the draft could count on being hounded relentlessly no matter where he tried to hide . If we could be hardboiled then about a restraint on human freedome for the sake of our national survival , we certainly could now crack down on a mere economic evasion , providing that we realize that failure to do so would undermine a policy.essential to long-term economic and political stability . FREDERICK L. LIGHTFOOT Greenport , N.Y. , Feb. 5 , 1978 Zero-Base To the Business Editor : Your article , " Zero-Base Budgeting : A Scorecard " on Jan. 22 presents some conflicting findings which suggest a possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A spokesman for the Health , Education and Welfare Department stated that zero-base budgeting forces " you to think through your priorities , " but " I do n't think they came out much differently . " A Commerce Department official found across-the-board priority for " apples and oranges " kinds of objectives to be too " simplistic . " The answer might be found in a third comment , by a Defense Department administrator , who felt that zero-base budgeting highlighted the need for " a closer link between planning and budgeting . " Indeed , any budget process which clarifies alternative choices for the allocation of resources imposes two new demands upon a chief executive and his advisers : 1 . A plan , or plans , which provides a systematic framework for the assignment of priorities which are more , rather than less , important to the fulfillment of the plan . 2 . Operational criteria , developed from the plan , which can be used to score programs as to their level of priority . Ironically , New York City 's government has always had a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the 1968 Lindsay administration budget process , just such an approach was employed . And , currently , the city 's management plan requires each agency to fate its programs as to their level of consistency with citywide priorities . MARK L. DRUCKER Assistant professor of urban studies Southern Illinois University Edwardsville , Ill. , Jan. 24 , 1978 Saving Energy . To the Business Editor : According to the article , " The Energy Strategy of the Heaviest Energy User " on Feb. 5 , Dow Chemical 's " most elabo .. rate and successful energy-conservation program in the business " saved it $150 million last year and the energy equivalent of 17 million barrels of oil a year . The vice president for operations , David L. Rooke , is quoted as having estimated that " its Federal regulatory costs in 1976 were over $186 million , the paperwork alone costing more than $20 million . " At another point , the 1976 earnings of the company are said to have been $612.8 million on sales of $5.65 billion , sales going up but profits going down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company an additional 30.4 percent in profits , which could have been applied to dividends , wages and capital improvements . As Mr. Rooke is quoted : " There are a lot of people sticking their noses in our business . " President Carter 's energy program is largely bottomed on energy conservation . It would seem elementary that some attention might be directed at reducing the cost and delays inherent in current Federal regulatory interference . PAUL R. SHAW New York , N.Y. , Feb. 6 , 1978
