Can there still be doubts that Russia has shed its brutal Stalinist past ? Not after what happened last week . In the course of arresting a noted Soviet author , two carloads of tough KGB ( secret police ) agents stopped everything , piled out of their autos and waded into a field to pick bunches of wild lilacs . Dissidents may be tossed into prison or insane asylums under Leonid Brezhnev 's regime , but this is repression with hearts and flowers . <P> Or is it ? Andrei Amalric , the defiant young writer who was the object of the KGB 's attention , may not feel quite so cheerful about it . Amalric , 32 , is the author of Will the Soviet Union Survive Until 1984 ? , which openly predicts the downfall of the Soviet system ( TIME , Dec. 19 ) . Ever since the book was published in the West earlier this year , observers of the Moscow scene have wondered how he managed to avoid arrest . One unlovely theory was that Amalric was part of a KGB plot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject of my possible arrest , " complained Amalric , " has become the litmus test of whether or not I am a KGB agent . " <P> Combative Nature . One morning last week , the KGB silenced Amalric 's detractors . Four cars bearing a total of 14 men pulled up outside the author 's country cottage near the village of Aku-lovo , 85 miles southeast of Moscow . Two men knocked on the door . They wanted to inquire , they explained , whether Amalric and his beautiful Tartar wife Giselle planned to vote in the next elections . Once inside , the two identified themselves as KGB agents and beckoned to their twelve colleagues . <P> True to his combative nature , Amalric insisted on his right to examine the credentials of each of the KGB officers . He also studied the arrest warrant , and when he detected an incorrect date for his birthday , he said jokingly : " You see , you have the wrong man . " Amalric learned that half of the agents were from the Siberian border city of Sverdlovsk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in typed form via the Samizdat underground press , had been confiscated by the authorities . <P> After an hour , the Moscow agents decided to take Amalric to the capital , where he has one room in a crowded communal apartment . Protesting that he had a right to be present while his cottage was being searched , Amalric refused to budge . Two KGB men lifted him up by the arms and led him away . <P> The remaining agents went through the cottage and confiscated 30 items . One was a Dutch edition in Russian of Amalric 's book , which one arresting officer ominously referred to as " a slanderous fabrication . " Another was an inoperable old hunting rifle , for which Amalric had no license-an offense punishable in the Soviet Union by up to two years in prison . <P> It was on the road back to Moscow that the KGB men spotted the field of lilacs and filled the trunk of one of the autos with them . When they came to a town , one of the officers suggested to Giselle that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need it where he 's going , " said the KGB man solicitously.
