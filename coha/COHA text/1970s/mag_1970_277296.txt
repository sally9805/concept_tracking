Imagine that after a junior officer in a Chase Manhattan Bank branch was caught with his hand in the till , Chairman David Rockefeller was hauled before Congress to apologize and given a 30% pay cut . It could never happen in the U.S. , where responsibility only goes so far . But much the same thing has happened in Japan . <P> Yoshizane Iwasa , president of the Fuji Bank , which is Japan 's largest , found himself held to account for an embezzlement by a minor loan officer in a Tokyo branch . Masao Suganuma , 41 , was arrested for taking $5,270,000 through phony loans . Once word got out , President Iwasa was summoned before the finance committee of Japan 's Diet to explain and apologize . Last week the bank 's board , of which Iwasa is a member , cut the pay of Iwasa and other officers and directors by as much as 30% for the next six months . The directors canceled their own bonuses , totaling $72,000 , for the two quarters ending in September . They decided that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovered the defalcation earlier . <P> Because of the embezzlement , the bank 's profit for the two quarters came to only $30 million , down 1.3% from the same period last year . It was the first earnings drop in six years . Though all but $2,000,000 of the embezzled funds will eventually be recovered from Suganuma , members of Japan 's financial community figure that the incident will continue to have a profound effect on Fuji Bank 's leaders .
