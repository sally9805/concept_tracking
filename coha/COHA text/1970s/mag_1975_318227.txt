THE GREAT WAR AND MODERN MEMORY <P> by PAUL FUSSELL 363 pages . Oxford . $13.95 . <P> <P> Everyone knows war changes culture ; but it is hard to say how , since war is culture . From the mid- ' 30s , war has been so continuous and " normal " a state of society that we find it awkward , even impossible , to detach it from our unconscious assumptions about literature and its workings . Hence the value of this extraordinary and moving book by Paul Fussell , a Rutgers University professor . There is , he argues , a peculiarly modern consciousness of war . It began in the trenches of France in 1914 , and it has continued to affect writing ever since . Indeed , European culture-especially in England-was so affected by the Great War that modernism itself owes no small part of its existence to the trauma of the Western Front . " The dynamics and iconography of the Great War , " Fussell claims , " have proved crucial political , rhetorical and artistic determinants ... At the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was generating new myth , and that myth is part of the fiber of our own lives . " <P> Sweet Wine . A fault line had opened in history , and all that had been taken as normal vanished into its rumbling cleft . Total war of this kind was unknown to living memory in 1914 . Gavrilo Princip 's bullet in Sarajevo destroyed a peace so long and so continuous that every European had come to take it for granted , as a given part of the fabric of his or her life . Nobody in England , France or Germany , not even the generals , had any idea what trench warfare-the dominant reality of the Western Front-would be like . When it came , it was indefinable : hundreds of thousands of young men existing like stupefied moles in the badly shored-up gutters of mud and decaying flesh that zigzagged their way across France , driven toward the machine guns of Poperinghe or the Butte de Warlincourt by the abstract decisions of rigid or incompetent staff officers . At 7:30 a.m. on July 1 , 1916 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thickets of German barbed wire along the Somme valley ; a few hours later , 60,000 of them were dead or wounded , and the cries of abandoned men were heard rising from no man 's land for days afterward . The Somme offensive was the greatest military slaughter in history . The Edwardian vocabulary of war , with its ritual chants of " sacrifice , " " honor , " " comradeship , " " red/Sweet wine of youth " ( meaning blood ) , was impotent to describe the massacre of a generation . Trench warfare was all the more incomprehensible because those who were in it had inherited a tradition of war as sport . Indeed , at the Somme attack , an officer named Nevill , of the 8th East Surreys , signaled the advance by kicking a football toward the German lines . He was killed at once , but other officers kept dribbling their footballs across no man 's land , earning a poetic encomium titled " The Game " : <P> <P> On through the hail of slaughter , Where gallant comrades fall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trickling ball . <P> <P> One of those footballs is now in a museum . The state of mind is gone forever . The sweet , class-bound innocence of such gestures now seems more distant than the moon , and madder than any war story in Pynchon or Heller.
