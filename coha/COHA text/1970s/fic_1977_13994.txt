Music : Harold in Italy by Berlioz . A spotlight from the back makes a dark shadow of a woman seated in her chair or on a chaise lounge . She is ill , coughing . Before her is a small glass on a silver tray , with a colored liquid inside it . VOICE OF BYRON ( Unemotional , cool ) : Is thy face like thy mother 's , my fair child ? Ada , sole daughter of my house and heart ? When last I saw thy young blue eyesThey smiled , and then we parted . The music fades into another sound : the noise of modern electronic computers . VOICE OF ADA ( Fierce , precise , swift ) : Picture a pile of circular metal discs heaped one above the other to a considerable height , each disc having the digits from 0 to 9 inscribed on its edge at equal intervals . That is the essential structure of the Analytical Engine . The computer noise becomes music again . VOICE OF BYRON Yet though dull Hate as duty should be taught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my nameShould be shut from thee , as a spell still fraughtWith desolation , and a broken claim:Though the grave closed between us  --  ' t were the same:I know that thou wilt love me . The music becomes computer sound . The woman stirs the liquid in the glass , and drinks it . p. 3 VOICE OF ADA Each disc can revolve horizontally , so that any required digit or combination of digits can be brought instantly into view . Theoretically , there can be any number of discs and columns of discs . Therefore , development of the Analytical Engine is limited only by present technical command of size and space . The computer sound becomes music . VOICE OF BYRON My daughter ! With thy name this song begun.My daughter ! With thy name thus much shall end.I see thee not , I hear thee not , but noneCan be so wrapt in thee : thou art the friendTo whom the shadows of far years extend . The music fades . The spotlight that makes a shadow of the woman also fades , and normal light comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ada sits at her table : intelligent , severe , ill . She is looking at her unfinished will . ADA I , Augusta Ada , Countess of Lovelace , do enjoin my dear mother , husband and children faithfully to execute this my last will and testament . She closes her eyes , coughs , presses her hand to her stomach in pain . She breathes deeply , puts the will down and stares at it.Last will . And testament . But what do I leave ? She takes from a pile of books and papers under her table a well-worn copy of Childe Harold 's Pilgrimage.My daughter ! With thy name this song begun.My daughter ! With thy name  --  She coughs , closes the book . She leans back in her chair , eyes closed again , as if trying to see something in her mind 's eye.Byron . Music .

We hear the high tenor of a choirboy , singing . The Boy stands off by himself , looking at Byron . ADA Who is he now ? BYRON Oh . p. 33 ADA Your choirboy ? BYRON Yes . ADA How did you find him ? Surely not in church ? Byron stares at the Boy anew , then moves to him again , slowly . BYRON In water . There my foot was as good as any man 's . I swam at Cambridge . One day I saw him , far out , waving his arms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . Byron stands behind him. I rescued him . We took off our clothes , to dry out in the sun . I found a creature like the animals I took home all my life : my hedgehogs , my turtles , my monkeys , my badger , my tame crow , my ducks and pigeons , my bear . My little dogs . All my helpless , wretched , lonely things . Myself , when young . ( He touches the Boy ) He was a farmer 's son , but he sang like an angel . And with him , so did I. The music stops . The Boy turns to Byron . Byron spreads wide his arms , and kneeling with the Boy , embraces him.There be none of Beauty 's daughtersWith a magic like thee , And like the music on the watersIs thy sweet voice to me.When as if its sound were causingThe charmed ocean 's pausing , The waves lie still and gleamingAnd the lull 'd winds seem dreaming . They kiss . The Boy rests against Byron.And the midnight moon is weavingHer bright chain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infant 's asleep . Byron strokes the Boy 's hair , with great tenderness.So the spirit bows before thee , To listen and adore thee , With a full but soft emotion , Like the swell of summer 's ocean . Music  --  the voice singing . The Boy leaves Byron , backing away into darkness.Goodbye. p. 34 ADA What happened ? BYRON I am a poet . He died , of course . Which you know . ADA Of pneumonia , in jail . Waiting to be hanged , for promiscuous sex , with many men  --  BYRON  --  on a gallows built for him alone , so he would not infect murderers  --  ADA  --  a pervert . BYRON Yes . God bless him . Pause . ADA Choking up ? That is to say you are deeply moved ? BYRON Think what you damn well please . ADA How touching .

Go to hell . ADA And all the rest ? You loved them , too ? Purely ? BYRON Well , that was all the rest . ADA Of course . BYRON What was I to do ? Lord Byron . Any decent woman I breathed on would have a baby the next day . Slovenly , loose women I could not enjoy . ADA Hoo ! BYRON Except , of course , under stress , and temptation . ADA How much stress and temptation did it take ? BYRON Well , very little , but do you really think that is fun ? ADA I think it was for you . BYRON I was all alone . Father , mother , family , gone . The only one left to me was my sister . I adored her , never happy , except with her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was bereft . It hurt ! ADA Oh , poor Byron . What a pose . Never to be happy , and no one cares . There was one portrait of you kept in the house . In a back hallway , covered with a green cloth . I found it , of course , and peeked . There you were . On a ship , sailing away . Like every other idiot with nothing to do , you traveled . Ropes appear , and along them , rising behind Byron a large sail . Behind it : color , a morning sky . Music.Away from home . Into a scarlet sunrise , under eastern winds , on a ship called the Lisbon Packet . Toward mountains of Asia , to seek Vampire Kings with bloody teeth . To desert monasteries , to study Greek and flirt with God . To the marble palaces of Turkish baths , to sink yourself in sherbet and sodomy . For Maids of Athens , Boys of Rome , nights of gin and dawns of verse , set sail , my foolish father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Young Man , Young Woman , Boy and Girl . They join Byron as passengers on a sea voyage . The sail now looms above them , and as they prepare for the voyage , it begins to move , to sway and , billow . Wind rises , and the people face the excitement and danger of a sea voyage at that time . Byron , apart , moves toward the center of the sail . p. 36 YOUNG MAN Off we go to Greece and TurkeyLord knows when we shall come back ! WOMAN Breezes foul and tempests murkyMay unship us in a crack ! BOY Now we 've boarded , lo ! the Captain , Gallant Kidd , commands the crew . MAN Passengers their berths are clapt in , Some to grumble , some to spew . WOMAN Heyday ! Call you that a cabin ? Why , ' t is hardly three feet square ! YOUNG MAN Not enough to stow Queen Mab in , Who the deuce can live in there ? The wind rises . The sail moves and billows out from the ropes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creak of ropes and decks .

WOMAN I will not survive the racketOf this brutal Lisbon Packet . p. 37 GIRL Now at length we 're off for Turkey ! Lord knows when we shall come back ! WOMAN Breezes foul and tempests murkyMay unship us in a crack . MAN All for this my skill is hired , Hark ! the farewell gun is fired ! We hear the boom ! of a ship 's cannon . Lights change . The people melt away , leaving Byron standing alone , holding fast to a rope , while behind him the sail shakes and billows . Another light is on Ada , seated in her chair , but lit with Byron , traveling as he does . Music . ADA Roll on , thou deep and dark blue ocean  --  roll ! Ten thousand fleets sweep over three in vain.Man marks the earth with ruin  --  his controlStops with the shore  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absorb 'd , and this is life , I look upon the peopled desert past , As on a place of agony and strife , Where for some sin I was castTo act and suffer , but remount at lastWith a fresh pinion  --  Byron sails , enjoying his freedom . From around Ada , speaking to her , appear Man , Woman , Young Man , Young Woman , Girl and Boy . Each carries a copy of a slim book of verse : Byron 's Childe Harold 's Pilgrimage . They read the lines to Ada , all genuinely stirred by Byron 's work . p. 38 YOUNG MAN I have not loved the world , nor the world me , I have not flattered its rank breath , nor bow'dTo its idolatries a patient knee  --  YOUNG WOMAN Nor coin 'd my cheek to smiles , nor cried aloudIn worship of an echo : in the crowdThey can not deem me one of such  --  Music .

Music . Wind . p. 39 ADA Childe Byron bask 'd him in the noonday sun , Disporting there like any other fly , Nor deem 'd before his little day was done , One blast might chill him into misery ! All the others turn to Ada . YOUNG WOMAN Childe Harold 's Pilgrimage . It 's beautiful . YOUNG MAN Do you know , he swam the Hellespont ? I mean , jumped in the open sea , and swam it ?

BYRON Are n't you taking that a little far ? p. 41 YOUNG MAN Of course , I do n't mean in person . I mean in situation . BYRON Which means a crucifixion . Thank you very much . ( He moves away ) BOY Is it true , Lord Byron , that like Leander you swam the Hellespont ? BYRON Not like Leander , no . He had a girl on the other side , for motivation . I did not .

" ( He moves away ) WOMAN Lord Byron , if you were n't already sleeping with so many of us , we would suppose you did n't like women at all . You wo n't even take dinner with us ! How do you reconcile such opposites ? BYRON Very simply . With the exception of lobster salad and champagne , women should not be seen eating . It spoils the other appetite . Besides , you always take the wing of the chicken . p. 42 BOY Lord Byron , please do n't joke . You mean too much to us . You are fierce and wise and alive . What do you think about life and death ? BYRON I like one better than the other . YOUNG MAN Do you believe in a life after death ? BYRON It does n't seem very likely . If we are all going to live again , why die ? MAN Lord Byron ! Have you no fear of God ? BYRON I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the next world , but for what he has already done to me in this one . WOMAN We give you our affection and respect , and receive your mockery in return . We are not fools . It is only your fear , in disguise . BYRON Absolutely . And since mockery may be the plaything God gives us when we are afraid , as a father makes a toy for a sick child , I cherish it . GIRL Lord Byron ! I can no longer exist without confessing how my soul burns with recognition of the beauty of your own ! BYRON Do you write verses too ? GIRL Yes . Do you think I want to kiss and tell ? BYRON No , I think you want to fuck and publish . ( He moves away from all of them , holding up his arms ) Now then ! From this pinnacle of social divinity , from this apotheosis of Regency perfection , from your caresses and your breath-taking praise , I must detach myself . It is wonderful to be a social lion . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lonely among people I can not trust and among waltzes I can not dance , and I 've fallen in love . Truly , terribly in love . I hope you understand . p. 43 MAN In love ?

YOUNG MAN All she does is gossip , laugh , have babies  --  GIRL And love her brother . WOMAN Lord Byron can have all of us , and sometimes does . Why her ? They step back .

YOUNG WOMAN ( Straight face ) Joanna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a baby . BYRON She 's sixty years old ! YOUNG WOMAN It will be a miracle , you see . The baby will be a boy . The new Messiah .

Ten doctors and ten clergymen examined her . BYRON What did they say ? YOUNG WOMAN Her condition , in a younger woman , would be entirely consonant with pregnancy ! BYRON Just in case  --  YOUNG WOMAN Shiloh may be the new Messiah . BYRON I long to see what she will deliver . Getting pregnant at sixty is certainly a miracle , but getting someone  --  They laugh . BYRON AND YOUNG WOMAN  --  is a bigger one ! They laugh , like children . Their delight in each other physically releases them , like sex . p. 46 BYRON Laughter . I think the great goddess of love , towering . Aphrodite , invincible Venus , is first and last , above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Me . BYRON A goddess . You . They stand very close to each other , but not yet touching .

BYRON Oh thine be the gladness , and mine be the guilt .

He uses her , to insult us . YOUNG MAN I suppose it is poetic . WOMAN Nonsense . It 's one more way of loving himself . It 's disgusting . BOY It 's shameful . GIRL Someone must stop them . WOMAN Who ? MAN How ? The Young Woman takes herself out of Byron 's arms . She kisses him lovingly on the mouth , but briefly , and then moves away . YOUNG WOMAN I ca n't live with you forever . BYRON Why not ? I wish you would . She kisses him again . YOUNG WOMAN You ought to get married . BYRON Goose ! YOUNG WOMAN You must sometime . BYRON Marry ?

( To Man ) I thank you for the brandy and the bad jokes , which I loved . ( To Girl ) I thank you for the locket , with the strands of our pubic hair clasped within it . That was very dear of you . ( To all ) All of you are dear to me , every one . But every one of you leads me backward , not forward , as if , once inside you , with my eyes closed , time will stop and recede . But of course it wo n't . A man will age just as fast during intercourse as he will during prayer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most hare-brained notions of privilege can stop time and feeling . I must do something more with my wretched life than fornicate with you , write verses , and have children by my sister . I must free myself from this gigantic wing of love that o'ershadows me . I must find a wife ! p. 50 MAN And by God , sir , you 'll regret that ! YOUNG MAN Unless he takes my wife . He can certainly have her . BOY I have a sister for you . WOMAN I have a niece . YOUNG WOMAN No . He 's leaving you . GIRL Leave me ? Never , Byron ! It is I , beloved , who will leave you ! She produces a small knife , and saws at her wrists . ALL ( In horror ) Ah !

Like me , like everyone else , she bored you . p. 83 BYRON No . I saw something . A shape , a form . Byron sits closer to Ada , with his skull cup of wine . He pours some wine in a glass and gives it to her , and she takes it . Talking to his daughter , he becomes very compelling : ironic , truthful , and seductive . In spite of herself , Ada is slowly drawn to him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countess and her husband , for a while . That is the custom in Italy . You become a cavaliere servente . Rhymes with plenty . A flatterer of tenors , a fancarrier of dowagers , an expert in the arrangement of shawls and lace . It was life as it really is : the opera . Five notes of pleasure , one scene of hysteria , and four acts of boredom . The count left his countess . I remained , steadfast . Shelley came , with his hopeless poems , his radical self-righteousness , and his talented wife he constantly dreamed about choking . Visions of dead babies in the foam of the sea , huge breasts turning into eyes , staring at him . Shelley 's wife brought along her younger sister , who climbed in bed with me  --  and , I suspect , with Shelley  --  until finally she could say , like her sister , she 'd also had a baby by a poet . Which poet ? I could n't tell . The baby was beautiful , like me , crazy like Shelley , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their request . A little girl , like you . I fed her cake .

It was only funny . ( He drinks ) Our little natural baby died in the convent school where I put her , to grow up as she should , with other children , and her mother accused me of murder , Shelley had fits . She died of a fever , asking a nun for a piece of cake . ( He drinks ) I was n't Childe Harold anymore . I got fat again . My skin turned sallow . My teeth came loose . My curls went limp . On hotel registers , where it said Age  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the shape began to emerge . My life  --  I saw it plainly  --  what a mess . A man 's soul , parboiled by his youth . ( He looks at the wine in the skull cup ) Like poor Shelley 's brains in the cauldron of his skull , seething , bubbling , boiling there , when we dug him out of the sand of an Italian beach , and cremated him in a tin oven , making a ceremony out of a suicide , which is what he was . And what I would be , too . ( Pause ) The shape of his life , and mine . Complete . But how to do it ? I had always been the great swimmer , so it would really be too embarrassing to drown , like Shelley . Or put a bullet in my head , since I had pointed so many pistols so many times elsewhere . But there it was , like a ship in the fog , waiting to take me  --  where ? ( He puts down the skull cup ) I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again .

If I 'd finished him , he 'd have died a miser , which I was becoming , and a Methodist , which is next . ADA ( Smiling ) A miser and a Methodist ? You ? BYRON It is called poetic justice . ADA But you did n't die a Methodist , did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not exactly . ADA And you went to Greece . You were n't a miser there . BYRON No . ADA Because of Byron , Greece is free .

I would go to see you twice a month . I would take you magnesia and tooth powder . Vinegar and greens , for your diet . Paper , ink , and gin . BYRON Yes . ADA There we 'd be , father and daughter .

Her greed for virtue and dominion is worse than yours for sluts and gin . BYRON Or yours for engines that think ? ADA Yes . She 's forgiven me that , finally . She even reads my book . BYRON Your what ? ADA I did n't mean to tell you . I wrote one . BYRON You ? ADA Nothing glamorous . Not very long . She takes a slim volume from her table and hands it to Byron .

BYRON ( Reading aloud ) " This language alone , spoken by a great engine , may finally trace among the agencies of our creation , the unceasing changes of mutual relationship , far too complicated for the human mind .
