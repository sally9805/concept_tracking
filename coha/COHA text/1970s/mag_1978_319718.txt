Volkswagen rolls into a Pennsylvania town <P> Until two years ago , the sleepy , small ( pop . 3,000 ) Pennsylvania town of New Stanton near Pittsburgh was little more than a cluster of motels , restaurants and gas stations serving passers-by on the Pennsylvania Turnpike and Interstate 70 . Now it has become a Rabbit farm . Next week Volkswagen Manufacturing Corp . of America , a subsidiary of the giant of German small cars , will begin turning out VW Rabbits in a refitted former Chrysler building on Route 119 , just outside New Stanton . <P> It will not be the first time that a foreign maker has produced cars on U.S. soil . Britain 's Rolls-Royce did it in Springfield , Mass. , from 1921 to 1931 . But Volkswagen 's huge investment-a projected $250 million-makes it unique right now . No other overseas automaker has a U.S. factory operating ; Volvo last year indefinitely postponed plans to build cars in the U.S. <P> The VW plant by late this year will crank out nearly 800 Rabbits a day ( 200,000 a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annually and pump an additional $50 million into the local economy by stimulating employment in auto-related industries . Already , says Plant Manager Richard Cummins , VW is doing business with some 1,800 Pennsylvania firms . If all goes as planned , VW will be assembling its U.S. Rabbits mostly from U.S.-made parts by next year , with only engines and transmissions coming from Wolfsburg , West Germany . In economically depressed Lewistown , Pa. , for example , C.H. Masland , a U.S. company , is building a plant to supply carpeting for Rabbits ; it will employ 200 people . <P> The VW plant has produced a miniboom in New Stanton real estate . Eighty-four new apartment units have been built , with another 96 on the way . Some land in the surrounding countryside ( mostly used for dairy farming ) has sold recently for as much as $7,500 an acre , up 50% in five years . Two new banks have arrived in New Stanton to compete with the long established Mellon Bank branch . " And we got a dentist , " adds Mayor John Reagan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volume through the town post office has increased by 30% during the past year . Postmaster Henry Springer hopes that New Stanton Post Office will be elevated to first-class status , enabling it to hire more staff and lengthen hours of service . <P> Some residents fear that the plant will lure black workers from Pittsburgh to their largely white community and create racial tension . Reagan dismisses that objection as mindless . " We have a few colored families in town and plenty of apartments going up to take care of the others , " says he . " They have as much right to work here as anyone else . "
