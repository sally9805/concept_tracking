No American institution , with the exception of the oil industry , perhaps , has been more severely criticized in recent years than the CIA , the Central Intelligence Agency . Once regarded as the brilliant collector of global information and valiant practitioner of derring-do in the Cold War , the CIA has seen its reputation , rightly or wrongly , become near brutal . By 1975 , it stood accused of perpetrating assassinations , terror , and all manner of plots against human liberty , even that enjoyed by American citizens at home . Specific accusations included funding and conspiring to overthrow leftist governments in Guatemala and Iran ; fomenting a coup against South Vietnam 's government in 1963 , ending with the assassination of President Ngo Dinh Diem ; running a " secret war " in Laos for ten years ; conducting infantry forays and bombing missions in Cambodia ; operating a bloody program to assassinate Vietcong ; intervening in the 1964 elections in Chile , and later creating economic chaos in that country in order to bring down its Marxist president , the late Salvador @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world ; spying on American citizens in the difficult , even fierce period of street demonstrations in the late Sixties ; and finally , playing a key role in the Watergate scandal . That 's quite a book , long enough to force a wavering or feeble-willed fellow into an endless fit of supplication , apology and penance . But when the men and women of an institution reach that point where they feel the attack is unfair , excessive , the backbone stiffens , and the urge torebut is felt . And that 's what happened at the CIA early this year after the New York Times published a bushel basket full of charges against the agency , richly accusing it of violating the law by spying on American citizens in the United States . Naturally , the Soviets followed the news with pious commentaries lamenting the condition of civil liberties for the unfortunate American people . But , as usually happens in the United States when there is a controversy over a well-established , even entrenched institution such as the CIA , some overdue education , as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the CIA 's twenty-eight-year history , millions of Americans have learned how the Agency came into being , what its purposes are , how it developed shortcomings , and that it rates more salutes than curses . One beneficial side effect of the turmoil over the CIA is that the agency lost some of its secretive and sinister image . It was President Harry S. Truman who asked Congress , through the National Security Act of 1947 , to create a secret intelligence agency , one which would bring together the plethora of intelligence-gathering activities Presidents Roosevelt and Truman relied on in World War II . Truman , already immersed in the beginning of the Cold War ( the Communists had already killed freedom in Czechoslovakia and blockaded Berlin ) , had the good sense to recognize that the United States could never again isolate itself , and indeed , was the leader of the free world . Moreover , as old CIA hands now point out , had there been a CIA in December 1941 , the Pearl Harbor disaster probably would have been prevented . The United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a coming Japanese attack , but it was scattered ; it would have been useful had it been collected in one place . Since the time the Spanish Armada threatened England , the British were the world 's greatest , and most successful , practitioners of world political and military intelligence . Long before the steam engine , railroads , the telegraph , the telephone , the motor car , radio or the air age we now live in , the British were the fastest and soundest collectors of information about what was actually going on in the world . British intelligence accomplishments became legendary . In World War II , the British were so successful that they were able to feed false information to German spies in England whom they let operate freely for the greater value of deceiving their Nazi bosses on the continent . World War II left Britain exhausted and dependent on the United States . The intelligence community we built during the war became the logical successor to that of the British , and we fell into the role . This situation was ideal because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the United States , were soon gripped in a sometimes ruthless , and possibly deadly , // or so it seemed , Cold War . Consequently , the U.S. Congress gave the new agency , the CIA , a blank check , for in the nuclear age , it considered American security in peril . Somehow , the notion of engaging in work which was intensely stimulating to the intellect , adventuresome , patriotic , and performed with the " right " kind of people made the CIA highly attractive to well-advantaged young men , particularly those from the then exclusive Ivy League schools . The " Old Boys , " the American gentlemen from what a British cockney would call " the privileged classes , " who ran U.S. intelligence in World War II , welcomed the bright young tigers , and , the tribal instincts being what they are , a new pack of " Old Boys " was formed . Nowadays , such folk are called the " establish . ment . " Using that label is important only in that it demonstrates how easy a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existence in terms of respect and autonomy . Indeed , the CIA 's reputation was so exalted that other intelligence-gathering bodies benefited from CIA luster and were lavished with generous annual budgets . The U.S. Intelligence Community , including the CIA , now totals about 153,000 personnel , with an estimated total budget of $6.3 billion . The CIA 's roster has some 16,500 employees and an annual budget of $750 million . Not many people know that the largest intelligence organization in the government is that operated by the Air Force  --  some 56,000 personnel and an annual budget of $2.7 billion . Surveillance by military aircraft is expensive . But the CIA is the elite organization . Though the CIA operates with the independence of a Grand Duke , the law did set some limits . The CIA was to " correlate and evaluate intelligence relating to the national security , and provide for the appropriate dissemination of such intelligence within the Government , " but was to have no " police , subpoena . law enforcement powers or internal security functions . " Those duties were left to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Act implicitly restricted the CIA to foreign intelligence . The law also stated that the CIA Director was responsible for protecting " intelligence sources and methods from unauthorized disclosure ... " And the Agency was given the carte blanche exemption from any law requiring disclosure of the organization , functions , names , official titles , salaries , or numbers of personnel employed . When the CIA opened its seven-story , marble headquarters at Langley , Virginia , in 1961 , with thick woods shielding it from common view , a sign was placed out front reading , " Central Intelligence Agency , " but not actually inviting visitors . When the Kennedy administration came into office , Robert Kennedy ordered CIA officials to take the sign down , the thought being that it was no one 's business what went on there . Indeed , the CIA fit the temper of the times and the Kennedy administration . When the Soviets shot down CIA pilot Francis Gary Powers , 1960 , President Eisenhower 's summit conference with Nikita Khrushchev had to be canceled . The Soviets were thrusting impressively . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States had not . They had put down the Hungarian Freedom Fighters revolution . They were about to build the cruel Berlin Wall , and shoot anyone in cold blood who violated it in an attempt to flee to the free West . Moreover , Soviet and Communist Chinese-inspired guerrilla forces were committing acts of terrorism throughout the " Third World , " in the alleys of Algiers , in the jungles of Latin America , and in the villages of Indochina . Since the CIA was deep into " clandestine " activity , it had its hands full around the world . The most ambitious project of that time , of course , was the invasion of Cuba , planned and to be executed by the CIA , using anti-Castro Cubans . President Kennedy , who had an affinity for adventuresome operations , a la James Bond ( one of his favorite authors ) , readily okayed the project shortly after entering office . It was a fiasco , and the Kennedy administration was forced to lie about it . " Bay of Pigs " was a phrase which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kennedy presidency was a charismatic one , and the young president 's moves were followed vicariously like a soap opera or an adventure film . So when the " Bay of Pigs " failure stuck out like a sore thumb in the Kennedy administration ( though it had been planned in the Eisenhower years ) , President Kennedy , with urging by his brother , Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy . decided that CIA Director Allen Dulles would have to go . He did , and his replacement . John McCone , a Kennedy favorite , was initially regarded as a reformer . But McCone did not substantially change the Agency 's modus operandi , or scope . Then , as now , the CIA sees its charter as fulfilling three roles : ( 1 ) To produce intelligence judgments , based on information from all sources , for the benefit of policy makers . ( 2 ) To develop advanced technical equipment to improve the collection and processing of U.S. intelligence . ( 3 ) To conduct clandestine operations to collect foreign intelligence , carry out counterintelligence responsibilities abroad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or paramilitary operations . It is important to study the meaning of the language describing those roles . That language certainly allows considerable latitude , enough that CIA agents have managed to collect urine from visiting foreign dignitaries ( without their knowing it ) ; employ electronic eavesdropping devices in Soviet officials ' cars in Moscow itself ; engage in research and development projects with U.S. corporations to develop equipment ; own and operate airlines and other " fronts " in order to carry out military operations ; and indulge in the mysterious , even glamorous , work involving cloak-and-dagger , female temptresses , burglaries , kidnap-pings . The CIA roughly divides its information-gathering into " overt " and " covert " activities . The " overt " work does n't necessarily have to be performed by the CIA itself . For example , the CIA produces on a regular basis documents called " Foreign Broadcast Information Service " ( FBIS ) reports . These are comprehensive monitorings of what the press , radio and television are saying about a variety of subjects in foreign lands . There 's nothing spooky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Service officers , Treasury Department representatives and defense attaches abroad . It amounts to clipping newspapers and magazines , tape-recording radio and TV newscasts and commentaries , compiling the material , and forwarding it on to FBIS . This kind of information-gathering is relatively old-fashioned . The CIA also benefits from sophisticated systems of collecting information , as Victor Marchetti and John D. Marks describe in their startling book , The CIA and the Cult of Intelligence . The authors claim that the CIA preferred the " cloak and dagger " approach , but was dragged into the technical collection syndrome , which included : " Highly sophisticated equipment on planes . ships , submarines , orbiting and stationary space satellites , radio and electronic intercept stations  --  and radars  --  some the size of three football fields strung together . The sensors , or devices , used for collection consisted of high-resolution and wide-angle cameras , infrared Continued on page 24 continued from page 12 cameras . receivers for intercepting microwave transmissions and telemetry signals . side-looking and over-the-horizon radars . and other even more exotic contrivances . " Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in a way made it possible for the United States and the Soviet Union to sit down and negotiate the limitation of deployment of strategic arms . After all , when the United States has an airborne camera which can photograph a manhole cover in Moscow from fifteen miles up , well . we do know what's. going on , or do we ' ? If humans were only technological components , the super-equipme n t just described might be sufficient for U.S. purposes . CIA Director William Egan Colby , fifty-four. argues that " overt and technical collection can not collect the plans and intentions of a hostile general staff , sense the political dynamics of closed authoritarian societies , or enable us to anticipate new weapons systems during the research phase before they are completed and visible . For this , clandestine collection is needed , especially by human sources . " But it is the clandestine area , one employing about one-fourth of CIA personnel , which wins the agency glamour and also invites the most danining criticism . Again , revelations of such CIA activity were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ December . In 1967 , Ramparts magazine , then published under liberal Catholic auspices , exposed the CIA 's clandestine relationship with the National Student Association . It turned out that the CIA financed students ' trips to international student conferences , with instructions to gather information useful to the United States . One of the celebrated beneficiaries of this CIA largesse was Gloria Steinem , now a leading spokesperson for the women 's movement . Ms. Steinem , then at Smith College . later denied that she knew anything about the CIA sponsorship . Firm . Another 1967 article , this by Tom Braden , who had headed the CIA 's International Organizational Division when that unit of Clandestine Services was subsidizing private organizations , disclosed , in The Saturday Evening Post , howlabor unions were given money to fight communist labor unions in other countries . Braden 's article . " I 'm Glad the CIA Is ' Immoral , ' " said $15,000 was giv .. o an American Federation of Labor official to pay off " strong arm squads in Mediterranean ports , so that American supplies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Braden also says he once gave Walter Reuther , president of the United Auto Workers , $50,000 in $50 bills , later spent in West Germany to bolster anti-Communist unions . As an Ivy League school graduate ( Dartmouth ) , Braden enjoyed his World War II adventures as an intelligence officer and was thrilled to join the CIA in 1950 . He recited the " enormous joy " he felt when CIA money he dispensed was used to make the Boston Symphony Orchestra win acclaim in Paris ( more than Eisenhower or John Foster Dulles could have ever received with speeches , said Braden ) , and how a London magazine . Encounter , fell into the literary swim with no one knowing it was CIA funded . This kind of activity , during the Cold War when the Soviet Union was clearly an ogre , did not much offend the sensitivities of American liberals . But when the Cold War thawed , new revelations about the CIA 's clandestine activities caused liberal blood to boil . The Vietnam war became unpopular and so did the CIA 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the CIA had a hand in the assassination of President Diem , and liberals moaned over the " Phoenix " program the CIA ran to kill off Vietcong . In 1971 , the Nixon administration admitted that the CIA was maintaining a 30,000-man " irregular " force in Laos to help fight the lovely little war in that besieged land . The punches were coming fast and furious at the CIA , and then , ham , came the sensational news that the CIA was involved with the Watergate scandal . Howard Hunt and the other Watergate burglars had been outfitted with paraphernalia used in the break-in ; indeed , several of the first group arrested had worked for the CIA . Then it was disclosed that the CIA , at the request of David Young , assistant to Kissinger , had prepared two psychological profiles on Daniel Ellsberg , the Pentagon Papers thief . And the CIA allowed itself to be used by the White House as a cover to divert the FBI from its investigation of the Watergate break-in . Then it was revealed that the CIA spent $3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over Chile , and another $8 million in 1973 to help bring on the coup d'etat which deposed Allende . What was fascinating about this disclosure was that CIA Director Colby acknowledged the Chilean project , while Secretary of State Henry Kissinger denied it , even making the denials under oath . According to the Washington Post , Kissinger remarked at a June 27 , 1970 meeting of the " 40 Committee , " the five-man supreme intelligence body of the U.S. government , that " I do n't see why we need to stand by and watch a country go communist due to the irresponsibility of its own people . " Kissinger later said he could n't remember making the statement , but on July 24 , 1970 , he ordered a National Security Council study done on Chile which included an option for clandes-Continued on page 111 // the main body . Whether we Americans like it or not , we are the major free power in the world , and in the absence of that power , the other strong forces in the world will be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way : " You can take the strongest man in the world and make him a pushover , if you blind him . Spying has been a necessity to security ever since Joshua sent spies into the land of Canaan . If the CIA becomes crippled , it would be very much like that strong man developing cataracts . " To illustrate his point about the importance of U.S. intelligence activities , another senior CIA official tells two stories about the communist mentality . The first concerns a bear and a lamb in the same cage at the Moscow zoo . A young American couple , tourists , were amazed at this sight , and asked the zookeeper how it could be . The zookeeper shrugged , and said that the bear and lamb mere y demonstrated peaceful coexistence , that the bear could be trusted . But when the couple left , still amazed , the zookeeper whispered an aside : " They do n't know that I have to put a fresh lamb in there every morning . " The other story is about the Soviet bear again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear asks the eagle what he wants , and is told , " To have a warm , fur coat about me . " The eagle asks the bear what he wants , and is told , " To have a good meal . " They both get their wish when the bear eats the eagle . It is pharisaical to believe that the rest of the world will live up to American standards of fair play and civil liberties . Every major nation and most of the small ones have their " CIA 's . " The most famous of course is the Soviet Union 's KGB , with its world network of operators , many in Soviet embassies , others posing as jour-nalists or Soviet trade experts . The United Kingdom has its Secret Intelligence Service ( MI-6 ) ; France , its Service de la Documentation Exterieur et du Contre-espionage ( S.D.E.C.E. ) , Israel , its Shin-Beth ; the People 's Republic of China has the Investigation Department of the Chinese Communist Party . Even tiny Luxembourg has its Service de Renseignements de l'Etat ( S. R. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States catches cold , the world sneezes . Just as the CIA has fallen on bad days in recent years , so have the intelligence-gathering agencies of other countries . Great Britain 's MI-5 , the counter-espionage adjunct to MI-6 , is roundly criticized for its role in dealing with terrorists in Northern Ireland . Australian police , in 1973 , conducted an extraordinary raid on that nation 's secret service headquarters because the agency had defied a government order to turn over certain files . In Canada , a charge was aired that a branch of the Government 's National Research Council was actually working with the American CIA , causing tempers to flare across that increasingly nationalistic Commonwealth . Aha , and in Paris , the S.D.E.C.E. was caught installing bugging devices in the offices of a leading humor magazine . The press dubbed this a " Watergoof . " At first the French laughed at this caper , but after two weeks , sentiment changed to indignation . One consequence was that the resignation of Raymond Mercellin , the Interior Minister also in charge of internal security , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had a scandal involving its intelligence unit , the " Informationbyran , " better known as IB . It was revealed that a young iB agent , who had infiltrated Swedish left-wing organizations , including Palestinian groups , was actually working for the Israelis . A storm was raised when it was charged that Sweden 's Defense Minister had caused Sweden 's precious neutrality to be violated on behalf of Israel and against the Arab world . This is a serious matter in Sweden . And in Germany , Chancellor Willy Brandt was forced to resign when it was disclosed that his personal aide , Guenter Guillaume , was a spy for East Germany . This was a complicated case indeed , but it brought on the establishment of a special commission which concluded that West German intelligence had become corrupt and inefficient . Though the United States and the Soviet Union are ostensibly moving toward detente , the Soviet press and propaganda outlets showed no mercy in their attacks on the United States after the CIA got unfavorable publicity . Day after day , broadcasts and art icles from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the CIA 's " dirty tricks , " that there was a systematic program by the government to deny citizens ' rights , particularly those of " progressive organizations " like the Communist Party . The Soviet barrage also included reports from other nations which purported to have uncovered various CIA plots . Naturally , these schemes were underway in countries which were either clients of the Soviets or being wooed by them . For the Soviets to righteously editorialize about " stifling of civil liberties and political rights " is almost humorous . In defense , the CIA argues that it is assuring the rights of those who advocate crippling or dismantling the CIA . With the exception of West Germany , no major nation subjects its key intelligence agency to congressional oversight . There is a mentality among senior CIA officials which the agency 's critics describe as obsessed with the clandestine . Others might call it vigilance . Whatever you call it , it holds that the United States is the target of those who would destroy our freedoms if they had the opportunity , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
