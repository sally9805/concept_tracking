txt Letters pg . 283 Letters Loss of libido Joann Rodgers 's article on hysterectomy ( " Rush to surgery , " Sept. 21 ) fails to mention another danger which sometimes follows this " second most frequently performed surgery " ? loss of libido . It is a medical axiom that most women experience no change in their sex drive after such an operation , that some , indeed , find their sex lives improved and that very few suffer a loss of libido . Yet that " very few " comes to a sizable percentage , particularly when both ovaries are removed . Dr. Kinsey reported a decreased sex drive among 11 out of 41 female castrates ( 26 per cent ) , Dr , N. A. Richards , of England , found 20 out of 33 ( 60 per cent ) . Dr. I. A. Donaldson , in a separate British study , reported 33 out of 51 ( 64 per cent ) women had a loss of libido following bilateral oophorectomy . However , if sexual anesthesia occurs , women are told that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help . The authority to support this view is the 1947 study by Dr. E. W. Munnell , who stated in the American . Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology that when deterioration in sex drive occurs following hysterectomy , " the cause . . . is undoubtedly psychogenic . " But other than the bald assertion , Munnell supplied no evidence to support his claim . A study of 23 women by psychiatrist M. G. Drellich on sex after hysterectomy also assumed that any loss of desire was psychogenic in cause . In short . there never has been a study to determine why some women suffer libidinal loss fol. lowing hysterectomy and/or castration . That they do is substantiated by Ann Landers : " Many women have written to say ' the thrill is gone ' after a hysterectomy ; however , almost as many have said ' nonsense , it 's better than ever . ' A ball-park estimate would be 50-50 . " JULIA SUKENIK Stewart Manor , N. Y. Joann Rodgers replies : Because libido is both hormonal-sensory and psychogenic in origin , it is no doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The point that Julia Sukenik makes , and which the medical literature amply supports , is that very few have even tried . It makes no more sense to say that the increase in sex drive some women experience atter hysterectomyoophorectomy is due to biologic elements than to say that decreases are due only to psychogenic ones . The fact is that no one really knows . There is some preliminary evidence that hysterectomy results in decreased hormonal function , and a number of studies have found that sexual activity may become painful after gynecologic surgery . Until psychobiology determines the intimate relationship between personality and biology , women would be wise to consider the possibility , if not the probability , of libidinal decrease or loss as one of the consequences of hysterectomy . A second opinion Two and a half years ago I went to my gynecologist to inquire about sterilization . Although I was only 32 and had no health problems , I was told to have a hysterectomy . Fortunately I investigated further , with the result that I had a tubal ligation done by laporoscopy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is infinitely safer and costs about one-fifth of the other . I rather suspect that it was the last factor which influenced the first recommendation . FRAN SMYTH Far Rockaway , N. Y. To operate , or not A couple of Mrs. Rodgers 's comments deserve some additional explanation . Statistics and figures about the number of hysterectomy operations in Britain or Sweden , as compared to those in the United States , must be considered in relation to the ! actors which contribute to such numbers . From English friends and from reading , one gets the impression that the lower rate of hysterectomies in England derives not so much from the lack of financial motivation as from the lack of hospital beds . Elective surgery involves a wait of a year to a year and a half , or more . Also , Joann Rodgers says " the ' feminine forever ' concept put thousands of women on hormones to delay the aging effects of menopause , " as though this were primarily appearance , contours , etc . It is our understanding that the hormones seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ susceptibility to coronary disease and other problems with heart and Letters blood vessels increases to equal that of men because of the reduction in their own hormones . " Feminine forever " has distinct health-maintenance aspects . The questions to be faced in the controversy over hysterectomy , or other instances of alleged excess surgery , are many , complex and multidimensional . In so many situations , the question is not answerable in easy , direct and certain statements , since not to operate may do harm just as to operate may do harm . Comments and questions from others lead us to wonder whether we currently overplay " all those hysterectomies . " We may be scaring off some people who really need that surgery now . Maser 0 . STYRT JEROME STYRT , M.D. Baltimore To each her own joy In " Rush to surgery , " Dr. James Nelson is quoted as saying : " In the 16 years I have been in practice , I have yet to find a woman who really enjoyed menstruation . " Incredible . I am 48 years old and have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoy " is a bit much . But I know many , many women who many , many times in their lives have greeted that monthly occurrence with exceeding joy and jubilation . JERALEE 3 . MILLER Raleigh , N. C. One woman 's " hunary " Interesting , Joann Rodgers 's revelation that some fibroid tumors can be controlled by drugs . It seems to be the best kept secret of the medical profession . In a one-year period , I asked 10 different gynecologists ( many with impeccable credentials who were associated with the top teaching hospitals  --  including one famous woman ) in the New York City area if there was a remedy other than the scalpel for fibroids ; they all held up their hands helplessly . " A uterus with large fibroids is a luxury that a 47-year-old woman can not afford , " I was told . ' At 47 , I was lucky to find a doctor willing to allow me the " luxury " of one ovary . Mrs. Rodgers 's other observations are unhappily true : the post-hysterectomy pain ( infinitely more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instant menopause , the year to regain strength , the amazing preponderance of black women on the gynecological floor of voluntary teaching hospitals . ZELDA KE.S.SNER Valley Stream , N.Y . Whose dream house ? The Times 's architectural critic has often gone out of his way to find and praise the work of a few architects whose design is all dolled up in perverse and arbitrary stylistic imagery . It was fun for a while to see what those fellows were up to , but Paul Goldberger ( " Tract house , celebrated , " Sept. 14 ) oversteps the limit of my credulity when he praises one of these ( not-so ) partical standing jokes as " one of the most profoundly inventive houses built in the United States in years . " At its most primitive level , the house is an easy problem to solve as it has few absolute imperatives , functional or otherwise . But it is enormously difficult to create a series of spaces that help shape and grace one 's life in all its myriad activities . I wonder , therefore , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this house . Has the designer simply concocted a three-dimensional **25;741;TOOLONG of our popular culture , using this building for didactic and critical purposes , or has he been concerned with the building as a container that shapes and amplifies the life that goes on within it ? Let us try to imagine living in this house . Let us arrive , leave our car in a sea of asphalt , move past an open carport to a narrow , dark passage which leads by means of a cranky turn to a concealed entryway , open the large double doors and fall immediately onto the super-wide entry stairs which apparently are the foyer . No place to shake off the rain or hang up a coat . We have been given only a few glimpses of the interior of this house , leaving much to our imagination , but these glimpses raise some questions . Try the pincerlike dining alcove out for size ? so narrow that half the diners are left stranded in the living room , Goldberg praises the architects as " superb traditional planners , " but we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the living room ( and across the famous foyer ) to the expectant diners . Seated in the living room , we have from one side a view of the ever-present foyer and from the other , a view through a full-height glass Letters wall to a narrow patio and lawn beyond . We note that the architects anticipated the glare on the glass and thoughtfully shaded the terrace with a " brise-soleil , " hardly a tract house element . Cozy this room is not . Would that our tour could continue , but much of the house remains undocumented . No views are given of the three children 's bedrooms which are dead rectangles , glazed from wall to wall , offering a smashing view of the parking lot ! Even this house 's supposed triumphs are not all that unusual . Many other architects have ignored formal front entries in favor of the approach by car , and scores of houses demonstrate practical , closely reasoned room layouts . The ordinary American builder 's house is indeed ? a triumph for our society . It is affordable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convenience and amenity . But mined with the building as a container that shapes and amplifies the life that goes on within it . " I believe the architects have done both ? they have indeed designed a polemical building that comments on other architecture ( although I believe it comments more on the idea of the manor house than it does on popular culture ) but they have also designed a livable , workable building . As I said in my article , this is a house before it is a polemic . Mr. Wasserman quibbles about all sorts of details which he finds make the house unlivable . I disagree ? there is room to shake off the rain in the foyer , the living room is pleasant to be in , the children 's rooms do not feel like tiny boxes overlooking a parking lot . The dining alcove is too small , I agree . But Mr. Wasserman exaggerates the supposed distance from the kitchen  --  food is carried the width , not the length , of the room and not across the foyer at all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . library , anyhow . But all of this is , I suspect , beside the point . What Mr. are its undoubted virtues a reasonable basis for composing an environment for a $150,000 country estate ? Perhaps , yes ; perhaps , no . But Pop-style or no-style , there are many age-old tests of pleasure and delight which must be part of any work of architecture . This house fails by so many objective standards that I can only conclude that this " celebration of ordinariness " by Robert Venturi is just plain perverse . JOSEPH WASSERMAN Haberman &; Wasserman New York City Paul Goldberger replies : Mr. Wasserman. wonders whether the designers of the house have " concocted a three-dimensional criticismcum-celebration of our popular culture " or " been conWasserman is really upset about is this house 's imagery . Perhaps he would resent any house that emphasizes imagery to such an extent , but the work of Venturi and Rauch comes in for a particularly hard time because it mocks " modern " architecture as surely as mannerism mocked the Renaissance , and many architects today seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since , like the mannerists . Venturi and Rauch continue to deal in arena traditional architectural terms . They make form , space and plans  --  and while they arrange these architectural elements in a new way their goal remains the trad'ition'al one of providing " commodity , firmness and deight . " I think they succeed Letters at this , and it disappoints me that a man with as trained an architectural eye as Mr. Wasserman fails to see the architecture before him . No labels , please My congratulations to The New York Times Magazine for showing us so thoroughly the new house by architects Venturi and Rauch . Their work is not everyone 's cup of tea . Its approach to design is especially difficult for us " old " moderns to stomach . But I have visited this house and I like it . I do n't like it being labeled a tract house , a Georgian manor home or as an analogy to Pop art . It is architecture ? different from what I am used to , but it opens up to our whole stodgy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the plans , it looks awkward and unfunctional . It is neither . It is easy to live in , great to . sit in , thrilling to enter ? peculiar as that entrance looks on paper . Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown are good architects as well as fascinating theorists . PHILIP JOHNSON New York City Let 's hear it for dentists Why did n't you have a dentist in your " Report on Men 's Wear " ( Sept. 21 ) ? I did notice that physicians and lawyers were also missing but they do n't need approval as much as dentists do . Dentists are poorly treated by almost everyone ; they are maligned by comics , sneered at by intellectuals , feared by the general public and considered hostile by psychiatrists . My husband would have been a marvel on your cover page . Even though he buys his clothes at auction sales and thrift shops , he still looks good picking up his mail . He 's also quite a sight when he 's cleaning the drains and he 's especially picturesque when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unpredictable and sometimes coordinated . When he goes to dental meetings , his fellow dentists are very impressed and say things like , " Wheredja get that jacket ? " or , " That 's a real combination . " If he had been on your front page , people would probably have said , " That 's some cover . " JOYCE GOLDMAN Morrisville , Pa . N
