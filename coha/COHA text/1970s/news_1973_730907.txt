txt The comeback of the dollar , still wobbly-kneed but on its feet , promises to lift a bit of the gloom from some big economic problem areas  --  the stock market , the U.S. economy and the world monetary system . That 's the cautious but surprisingly uniform view of a variety of economists , bankers and dealers in foreign exchange . They see a modest fallout of benefits ahead as they watch the declining price of gold and the slight but steady rise in recent weeks in the dollar 's long-depressed price ( as measured in terms of such currencies as German marks , French francs and British pounds ) . One immediate plus : An American in Paris now can get a 50-franc dinner for an outlay of $11,80 ; as recently as three weeks ago , it would have cost $12.40 . ( Of course , last summer , the dinner would have been only $10.50 . C'est la vie . ) An increasing number of analysts in both the U.S. and Europe now expect the dollar to continue to gain strength in foreign-exchange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not without gyrations . Credit for the turnaround , which follows months of declines , goes to a variety of factors . One is soaring U.S. interest rates , which are beginning to draw in foreign investment . Another is an increasingly favorable outlook for the balance of payments , the flow of money in and out of the nation . The Trend Is Up " I think we 'll still have ups and downs because markets go mainly on expectations , and these expectations can be reversed . But the trend on the average is up , " says Harold Van Cleveland , vice president and economist for First National City Bank . Similarly , Karl Otto Poehl , under secretary in the West German Finance Ministry , sa 'd recently he expects the dollar 's price to stabilize or possibly continue to gain . " We have seen the bottom for this year , " says Charles R. Stahl , president of Economic News Agency , a Princeton , N.J. , advisory firm . " The dollar will be 8% to 10% up ( from the low levels of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he predicts . This would put it back at the level prevailing before its devaluation in February and would make the dollar worth about 2.9 marks ( against 2.4 now ) , 4.6 French francs ( against 4.24 now ) and 3.4 Swiss francs ( against 2.9 ) . In the frantic exchange markets of early July , the dollar plummeted to 2.29 marks , 4.22 French francs and 3.05 Swiss francs . The current predictions of continued dollar firmness do n't usually extend to the long term . The dollar 's price is affected by so many economic and psychological factors that most analysts say trying to predict for a year or more ahead is futile . But if dollars do indeed strengthen even temporarily  --  or at least avoid new fainting spells  --  the effects will still be important . For example , in the market for shares in U.S. companies , a relatively stable dollar would help heal the wounds of previous dollar devaluations . Two official reductions in the price of the dollar slashed the value of foreigners ' investments , even if market prices of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If confidence can be restored , says William Freund , vice president and economist for the New York Stock Exchange , foreign buying could again become an important element in the market . More Acquisitions Ahead ? Last year , net foreign purchases of U.S. equities came to $2.1 billion , not far from the high of $2.3 billion in 1968 . In the first three months of this year , $1.5 billion in foreign investment came pouring in , but it dried up during the next three months . Some analysts now expect it to pick up again , especially through direct acquisitions of U.S. companies by foreign companies . As for the U.S. economy , a stronger dollar would help to moderate price increases on imported commodities and other goods . The cost of many foreign goods has been soaring , not only because of direct price increases but also because of the declining purchasing power of dollars . And already , says William Wollman , an economist at Argus Research Corp. , improvements in the U.S. balance of payments are bolstering the gross national product  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By one method of measuring trade , net exports were in deficit last year by $4.6 billion , he notes . He forecasts a surplus of $1 billion this year This would be a swing of $5.6 billion for the gross national product , and that , the economist says , " is a lot of scratch . " Effect on Commodity Exports A strengthening dollar , which can be credited in part to an improving balance of trade , might also have the ironic effect of allowing the U.S. to further restrict exports of commodities that are in short supply , as is already being done with soybeans and some other products . Such restrictions , aimed at reducing price rises in the domestic economy , also reduce revenues from overseas and therefore tend to weaken the dollar in world markets . But , if the dollar is strengthening for other reasons besides trade , the administration would have ) me leeway to further curtail foreign sales of critical products . " After all , " one private economist says , " we do n't want the dollar to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have occurred to him a month ago . Cheap dollars , of course , can help U.S. exporters compete in world markets if they are translated into price reductions . A more stable dollar would also improve the environment for restructuring the international monetary system . During the tedious months of negotiations on this complex chore , foreign financial officials have frequently complained that the chronic weakness of the world 's major currency made their task more difficult . In recent weeks , however , members of the so-called Committee of 20 , formed by the International Monetary Fund to overhaul international rules on money management , have said they are making good progress . Their goal is to devise a system for preventing the kind of massive , prolonged payments imbalances that have piled up mountains of dollars overseas and led in recent years to frequent crises in world money markets . Some solid indications of agreement are already evident . Most notably , the U.S. and other major nations have given one another what amounts to a partial guarantee against possible losses arising from certain rescue operations in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Volcker , an under secretary of the U.S. Treasury , central bankers have agreed to share losses half-andhalf when they arise through use of " swap lines . " Swap lines are short-term credit facilities among central banks through which , ? instance , dollars can be exchanged C .. ? ? irrencies up to specified amounts . T 1111 for the U.S. was recently increaser $18 billion from the previous $11.7 1 ) .1 . dollar comes under unusual price pressui c in terms of , say , marks , the Federal Reserve Bank of New York gets marks from the German Bundesbank in exchange for dollar credits and sells the marks for dollars on the open market . Later , the New York Fed must buy marks in the open market and repay the Bundesbank . A change in market exchange rates in the meantime will cost one or the other bank money  --  a loss that previously was borne entirely by the bank that initiated the swap ; in the past , this was almost entirely done by foreign central banks . Under the new accord , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to the nittygritty of a new monetary system , " one economist says . The significance , in his interpretation , is that foreign central banks now have a partial guarantee against exchange losses if the dollar should weaken and that this will make them more willing to hold dollars in their reserves . The agreement is also seen as solid evidence of renewed cooperation among central banks in their avowed determination to foster orderly transactions in foreign-exchange markets . From March until July , the world 's major currencies had been floating against the dollar ; dollar prices changed in response to market forces without any effort by the Fed or other monetary authorities to intervene . In theory , the dollar should have been strong during this period . The country 's exports were rising , and the dollar was almost universally considered undervalued as a means of carrying on trade and investment . Instead , the dollar plunged . The reason , economists say , is that currencies serve not only for immediate transactions but also as a store of value . With the dollar already under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiencing severe inflation , foreigners were unwilling to add to their already large holdings of the currency . By July , according to foreign-exchange dealers , the markets were fluctuating erratically , with rate changes of as much as 2% to 3% a day . On Friday , July 6 , with the dollar diving , several major New York banks suspended foreign-exchange operations altogether , it is understood . ' ' They felt as if they were caught in a downdraft , with nothing but air under their feet , " one banker says . Over that weekend , the central bankers negotiated the swap-line expansion and indicated their intention to intervene in the market to restore order . While the U.S. does n't disclose its current operations it is understood that since then , the Fed has intervened in the market several times on a small scale and at least once in very large amounts . That was July 26 , when the price of the mark was rising rapidly in response to soaring German interest rates and to rumors that the German currency would be officially revalued upward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the currency prices , not at defending unrealistic exchange rates , various monetary authorities have emphasized . Even so , some economists believe that central-bank intervention can be dangerous when carried to extremes ; in the past , for example , it has caused massive flows of funds across borders as speculators attacked exchange rates that : the central banks were trying to defend . And even if it does n't do any harm , intervention may be irrelevant in terms of how the market sets currency values , these economists argue . Argus ' Mr. Wollman , for example , declares , " Central bankers remind me of the xylophonist at a striptease show ; he thinks it 's his xylophone playing that 's turning everyone on .
