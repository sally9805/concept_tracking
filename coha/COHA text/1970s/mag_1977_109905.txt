Everybody knows about the Longhorns of Texas : big team , big school . This is to introduce the Red Raiders of Colgate , a tiny but major college that runs the rusty old wing T. Forget the difference in size  --  Colgate is going stride-for-stride with Texas as the only unbeaten team left in the country . Last Saturday the Raiders piled up 540 yards while whipping Boston University 43-22 for their eighth straight . It now seems eminently likely that Colgate will roll to an 11-0 season , outstatisticking every other team in the nation . It also seems eminently likely that the Raiders will finish unranked and uninvited. // With reason . Colgate is chewing its way through a less-than-demanding schedule that includes five Division II teams . A few weeks ago Colgate publicist Bob Cornell mailed flyers to representatives of the Peach , Tangerine , Independence , Sun and Hall of Fame Bowls . So far the Peach , Tangerine , Independence , Sun and Hall of Fame folks have failed to get terribly enthusiastic . In fact , they have n't responded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered tragic , but Colgate has been down this road before . In 1932 Coach Andy Kerr led the Raiders to a 9-0 record , a memorable season in which they outscored their opponents 264-0 . But the Rose Bowl selected Pittsburgh , which had been tied twice , to play Southern Cal . The Trojans won 35-0. // To the people in Hamilton , N.Y. , being spurned was a cruel blow  --  Colgate was a legitimate power in those days . It had All-Americas such as Leonard ( Iron Legs ) Macaluso and Eddie Tryon . It had Kerr , who was an assistant to Pop Warner at Stanford before bringing the double wing east to put Colgate on the map . Colgate also had a renowned cheering section and the infamous Hoodoo Hex , a jinx imposed on archrival Syracuse that was supposedly responsible for the Orange 's inability to beat Colgate from 1925 to 1938 . In one six-year period Colgate won 47 of 53 games , upset national powers NYU , Indiana , Michigan State and Tulane , and came to be known  --  Hamilton lies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chenango. // Since the Kerr years , however , Colgate has received less fanfare , and Hamilton , a sleepy village of old faces and no industry , has had to be content with memories . The school turned out a few notable individuals  --  Marv Hubbard , Mark van Eeghen and Mark Murphy , currently one of two rookies playing for the Washington Redskins  --  but its records were mediocre . It was only last year , after Fred Dunlap was hired as Colgate 's 27th head coach , that things began to change for the better . // A fullback at Colgate in the ' 40s , Dunlap was hired away from Lehigh , where he turned a 1-8 team into a 9-2 success that ranked in the nation 's top five in offense and scoring in 1975 . Dunlap also grew to understand the workings of limited-budget football : if you lack top-flight athletes , you stress a more subtle system of offense . Dunlap favored the wing T , a now-archaic attack once used with great success by a number of major teams . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up against Delaware , a Division II power that beat him eight of the 10 times they met . " Those game films used to disturb me , " he says . " They did n't outhit us , or out-man us . Eventually I realized they simply outfinessed us. " // Thus inspired , Dunlap installed the wing T at Colgate , and the Red Raiders won their first eight games  --  for the first time since 1932 . This year Colgate opened with a 23-0 mauling of Rutgers as Bob Relph threw two touchdown passes and Jerry Andrewlavage boomed an 83-yard punt . Relph passed for nine more TDs in victories over Lafayette , Cornell and Harvard . The Raiders then beat Holy Cross 31-14 as Fullback Pat Healy scored on runs of nine and 12 yards . In a 31-13 win over Princeton and a 48-36 defeat of Columbia , the offensive line of Tackles Rick Doell and Ed Argast , Guards John Gibney and Dave Bachmand and Center Mike Foley was opening holes roughly the size of badminton courts . Halfback Henry White gained a career-high 204 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the offense had been sizzling all season , last Saturday at BU it burst into flame . // Relph completed 16 of 29 passes for 293 yards , breaking the Colgate record of 270 set by Tom Parr in 1972 . He also threw for two TDs , giving him a career total of 26 , another school record . Healy rushed for 94 yards , boosting his career total to 2,604 , which put him ahead of van Eeghen as the college 's alltime rusher . Oddly enough , however , it is White who is leading the nation in all-purpose running and ranks among national leaders in rushing , averaging 109 yards a game and 8.72 yards a carry . Colgate leads the nation in total offense with 486 yards a game , ranks seventh in passing ( 225.7 yards ) and is seventh in scoring ( 35 points a game ) . // In the wing T , plays develop slowly . The backs hesitate long enough for the linemen to maneuver into position to make their blocks . The guards and tackles aim more to confuse or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarterback can call a myriad of shifts , slants , dives , pitches , look-ins , Z-outs and hooks , and he spreads them around in a way that makes it seem as if he draws his plays in the dirt back in the huddle . The Colgate attack has an average gain of 5.4 yards per play rushing , 8.6 yards passing . " The whole system is based on causing the defense conflicts , " Dunlap says . " You block everybody with a different man all the time . You show a play run with one blocking scheme , and the defense thinks it knows it . Then you run the same play  --  or at least it starts out looking just like the same play  --  and block another way , and suddenly you have something going . " // With all this success comes the question : How good is Colgate ? There may not be an answer . Among its opponents , only Rutgers has met a top-20 team , and in that game Penn State manhandled the Scarlet Knights 45-7 . On the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know how good we are , " Dunlap says , " but we play real well . " // In seasons to come Colgate also will be playing Penn State . Dunlap has scheduled series with Army and Syracuse and is looking to add a Wake Forest , an Air Force , a North Carolina . He figures Colgate can play a tougher schedule without spending more money to build up its program . But for now , the only way to find out how good Colgate is would be to throw the Raiders up against a strong team in a postseason bowl . The ACC runner-up in the Peach , say , or Brigham Young in the Sun Bowl , would suit Dunlap fine . He says he would not consider playing a team with a less glamorous reputation . Are you listening Peach , Tangerine , Independence ? Hello , Sun Bowl ? Are you there , Hall of Fame ?
