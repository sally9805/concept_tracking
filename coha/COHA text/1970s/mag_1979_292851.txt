Almost as soon as the accident at Three Mile Island occurred , Radiation Physicist Ernest Sternglass was at the scene , Geiger counter in hand , crying disaster to anyone who would listen . He predicted an increase of 5% to 20% in the incidence of leukemia in children of the area within a year . A vehement foe of nuclear power , the University of Pittsburgh scientist exclaimed : " The reaction of the community should be to stand up and scream ! " <P> Sternglass 's warning was exaggerated . But no one-not even radiation experts-can say for sure that he is totally wrong . Despite science 's long experience with radiation and bitter knowledge of its risks , like the cancers inflicted on early radium workers , including Madame Curie , disturbingly little is known about how much radiation , or what length of exposure , is safe for humans . <P> Radiation , whether natural or manmade , is ubiquitous . Over a year 's time , the average American is exposed to 100 to 200 millirems . This is roughly equivalent to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half of that radiation comes from the sun and cosmic rays , another 45% from exposure to diagnostic and therapeutic medical equipment , and only about 5% from atomic fallout and such consumer products as microwave ovens and TV sets and production of nuclear power . Radiation sickness is almost certain at exposures of around 50,000 millirems . The Government has set a permissible annual level of radiation exposure for the general public of 500 millirems and for nuclear power plant workers 5,000 millirems . But these standards have been sharply questioned by radiation biologists , physicians and other scientists , and the Government is now reviewing its policy . <P> Most of what is known about the dangers of radiation comes from studies of people exposed to extremely high levels , such as the survivors of the A-bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki and patients who were massively dosed with X rays for ailments now no longer treated in this way . <P> Problems that eventually surfaced , sometimes after 20 or 30 years , included clouding of the lens of the eye , leukemia , thyroid cancer , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , primarily during their first three months of development , and children under ten . <P> More recently , studies , whose validity has been hotly debated , have suggested similarly troubling effects , especially high incidences of leukemia , among people who were exposed to considerably lower levels of radiation . Among the possible victims : residents of Arizona , Nevada and Utah who witnessed early atomic tests in the atmosphere and were showered with fallout , and workers in nuclear shipyards . In fact , many experts now believe any radiation carries with it some risks , as yet undefined , that may take years to show up . As Harvard University 's Nobel-Prizewinning Biologist George Wald , an antinuclear activist , puts it : " Every dose is an overdose . There is no threshold where radiation is concerned . A little radiation does a little harm ; a lot does more harm . "
