THE public record on this episode is blotted with falsehood . The aura of scandal hangs over the whole matter . If Mitchell says under oath what he said in the statement he issued it will be one of the most arrogant displays of perjury this committee has ever heard . " <P> The sedate hearing room of the Senate Judiciary Committee had rarely rung with such harsh language . Columnist Jack Anderson was pressing his charges that the Nixon Administration had settled antitrust suits against the giant ITT Corp . in return for up to $400,000 in backing to bring the Republican National Convention to San Diego ( TIME , March 13 ) . As the second week of tense testimony unfolded , Republican officials were still on the defensive . The Administration had requested the hearings , hoping to dispel quickly any whiff of a deal . Thus far it had failed , and gleeful Democrats were only too happy to prolong the agony in an election year . <P> Conflicting . The political stakes were high . For the Government and a corporation to collude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nixon was described as wanting the Justice Department to make " a reasonable settlement " with ITT . Also at issue were the integrity of the President 's closest political and legal adviser , John Mitchell , and the fitness of Mitchell 's deputy , Richard Kleindienst , to be confirmed by the Senate to succeed him as Attorney General . Equally assailed was the trustbusting reputation of Richard McLaren , Mitchell 's former antitrust chief and now a federal judge . Over it all loomed the blemished image of a hard-drinking , tart-tongued ITT lobbyist , Dita D. Beard , who was ill in a Denver hospital and unable to testify . It was her memo , as reported by Anderson , that described the supposed deal . <P> As Democrats and Republicans on the committee thrust and parried in the dramatic duel , the testimony turned complex . Only a few basic facts had not yet been disputed . The Government , under the aggressive McLaren , had begun moving against ITT in 1969 , trying to prevent the nation 's eighth largest industrial corporation from expanding . McLaren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wanted clarification of the Government 's powers to limit the growth of conglomerates-a matter on which the court had never ruled . In the early summer of 1971 , San Diego had little interest in bidding for the Republican Convention , but Nixon wanted it there . Local financing was one problem . At a private dinner meeting in San Diego on May 12 , ITT President Harold S. Geneen told Republican Congressman Bob Wilson of San Diego that ITT would pledge up to $400,000 , if needed , to finance the convention . San Diego was selected as the convention site on July 23 . On July 31 , the Justice Department announced that it was dropping its suits against ITT and had reached a settlement . <P> The Administration claims these events were coincidental ; Anderson sees a cause-and-effect relationship .
