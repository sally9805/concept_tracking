John Denver . By the pool . Not his pool . Not some overpriced watering hole where stars gather . An ordinary motel pool . And he 's not lounging . He 's working . Or about to . " God ! When I think of the places I 've stayed . I remember a hotel in New York . No air conditioning . " He says it with the weariness of someone who has struggled with windows , the way they can be stuck only in July in New York hotels . You are surprised to hear this man  --  so young , like a sort of Jack Benny perpetually twenty-nine even though he 's thirty  --  talk trouper talk . " When we travel  --  I try to stay home three days a week , the rest of the time I 'm on the road  --  I carry the guitars . We rent a car . Stay in a Holiday Inn .

There is a tinge of regret in his eyes  --  the regret everyone feels when summer is over and the watermelons are gone  --  but he says , " There is n't any place in the world I 'd rather be right now than right here . Annie and I 've just built a house  --  in Aspen  --  I ca n't remember a time when I did n't want to live in the Rockies and I wondered how I 'd feel when the time came to go out to be in hot muggy Cleveland instead of the cool mountains ; but I 'm grateful to the people who like me , and who make it possible .

" people can do things to widen the gulf between being a star and being just anyone . What I want to do is narrow it . " Dick Kniss , Denver 's bass player , narrows the gap on the chess board he 's been distracting Denver with . " Checkmate . " Denver utters a mild expletive ( he also drinks a beer occasionaly and is not as goody-goody as rumored ) . " There goes my resolution . I was n't going to lose in September . " " And here it is only the first day . " " People come to my shows to get turned on about themselves , not me .

" Does Denver see himself in a tradition ? " Not really . Contemporary music got so big so fast . Rock happened . Bill Haley and the Comets . " Haley 's hit record " Rock Around the Clock " number-oned the charts in the U.S. and in England , announcing the engagement that was later to be consummated by those latent Edwardians , the Beatles . The song provoked a mild riot at Princeton ( " feverish though harmless , " exclaimed the Philadelphia Inquirer ) , established rock as rebellious music through the association of the song with the movie Blackboard Jungle , pushed rhythm out over melody and made shouting lyrics more efficacious than singing them . In short , conventional jazz techniques were insinuated into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done before , even from the moment of jazz 's inception , but after World War II , jazz had tended to separate itself from pop , had opted for the classical , ignored its master 's voice the vox populi , became the property of buffs with memories and expensive equipment ; but never had that inverted seventh made itself heard on the billboard scale of hit-parade popular music . ) " Folk was different from rock , " says Denver . " Then the Beatles came . Dylan went electric . " And through it all , through the gigantic eruption that made popular music one , with itself , with its audience , its creators and its marketeers , one in the sense that it was now perfectly all right for balladeers to twang country-and-western , for serious jazzists to croon June-moon-tunes , for rockand-rollers to lull limpid lullabies , and vice versa the whole thing , through all of this upheaval , a clean swipe of elemental harmony and melodic simplicity beginning with , say the Kingston Trio , persisted . John Denver is part of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music . " Mickey Mouse , Tom Sawyer , Mr. Clean . " These get hurled at him . " The critics have never liked what I 've done .

" Dick Kniss , bass . Steve Weisberg , guitar . " When I hear those guys I think , wow , have I got a lot to learn . " Them on him : " He 's the best man I 've ever worked for . And I 've worked with everybody . " ( Herb , a professional drummer since 1949 ) " Straight , but better than regular . " ( Paul ) " Nut a bad chess player  --  which means I win now and then .

" People relate to my songs in a way maybe they do n't relate to the Stones . " I want to communicate the incredible JOY ? it 's said in caps almost like the dishwashing liquid , convincingly , thought ? I have in life or in living or in loving someone . What I have , anybody can have . " Life is all we have . My closest belief in the Creator is what the Indians called ' The Great Spirit . ' " His beliefs are as much a part of his appeal as his music . Still he 's a careful musician . " Sometimes I do n't practice , per se. but not a day goes by I do n't play . I know people would 've noticed if we had n't practiced last night  --  gone over the songs . I sing notes sometimes in a concert or in a recording session that raise the hairs on the back of my neck . " Denver is a broad tenor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a " disease , " and the breadth and strength of his voice box is evident when he speaks  --  louder than your nearness and the size of the room require .

Pack up his ' 55 Chevrolet to follow a migratory pattern of lemmingesque proportion for Young America . To California . Where the world begins all over again , or so young people think . John had a trade- drafting  --  a guitar . He did n't exactly cream the coffeehouses where he performed at night the way Joan Baez had a decade before around Harvard Square . And it had been tougher for Joan . She had had to open up folk singing , wrench it away from scholarly performers like Richard Dyer Bennett who treated it as museum melody , something for necktie concerts . But neither Joan nor John had it hard , say like Woody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baez came of academic parents ; John 's father was an air force officer . " I had kind of a lonely childhood .

I did n't want 58 THE SATURDAY EVENING POST January /February ' 74 them to be sorry they 'd asked . " Nobody 's been sorry since . When he arrives at Blossom Music Festival , an open air concert hall that looks like a relic from The Poseidon Adventure with a visor on it , you become aware of his professionalism . People are pouring into their seats . The sound check begins like any Kiwanis Club dinner . " Testing , one , two , three . " The first guitar plucks . Rubber bands .

The band goes over a new song John has written , " Uncle Matthew " about a boy raised on love and joy . The tenor voice slides easily up the arpeggios , bringing the emotion back down into the song from the rafters where , with a lesser artist , it might hang . " Can you move that bass back from the mike ? It 's so close it 'll be getting some of the feedback , " calls a voice from the back . Lowell Norman , the background engineer , sets up the screens behind Denver for the light show . " I wish they would n't build these amphitheaters facing west . That sun 'll kill us on the first two numbers . " After the rehearsal  --  before the show  --  Denver likes to rest . Alone , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand people out there , and I 'll go back to the mountains and be just as happy . " He is wearing a pair of brown and white jockey shorts , mod , and has just washed his hair , and is drying it with an electric blower . " The music and lyrics usually come together for me . I start with a phrase . Uncle Matthew ' took two days . Rocky Mountain High ' a year . " Outside , Art Stokes , an audio engineer , says , " These people come here to listen . Some kids come to make noise but not these . The only other time it happened was with Judy Collins . " The young and the not so young and the distinctly old are spreading themselves on the hillside like a blanket of confetti . A faint whiff of marijuana rises  --  so faint , though , it is perhaps the mildest on the U.S. concert circuit . Kent State is fifteen miles away . There are faces here that remember and for whom folk and pot and death will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But they are there . And Denver is aware of them . And of serious currents in popular music . " Some guys came backstage at intermission at a campus show we did year before last Demanded I sing a song they 'd written  --  some anti-war stuff , Youth Coalition for Peace . I asked how long their protest group 'd been in existence . One of them said four days . I said , ' Look , I 've been singing protest songs six years . ' Students get all worked up every spring . Then summer comes , they go fishing and forget . " People on an individual basis will make changes  --  not protesters or lobbyists . People who do what they really know to be right or true . Little things . In traffic , in grocery stores , you let somebody else in front of you . That 's peace . You have to have some consideration for the things around you and the things that happen . Then , there 's joy , great joy in life . " A stagehand brings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Here 's my personal mug . " John : " You mean you 're going to let me drink out of that ? " Another stagehand : " I hope you cleaned up your pyorrhea . " Bell . Anonymous voice . " Fifteen minutes please . " Denver pulls on brown suede western style pants . Cowboy boots . A red print shirt . Fastens a silver buckle . His soft brown eyes seem far away as he walks on stage to a roar that has nothing sexual in it . " We 've got a far out show for you tonight , " he says . It is of course not very far out , and in a way you 're grateful . You 've been far out . With people like Alice Cooper . Edgar Winter . David Bowie . Today 's rock star is tomorrow 's teen angel . So maybe it 's good to be squarely back . With inoffensively wholesome John Denver .

Then Denver 's " Leaving on a Jet Plane " which Peter , Paul and Mary made , and which partly made them . " Country Roads . " Songs that take you back , not in musical style , although they are far from avant-garde , but in thinking . As you listen , you can almost breathe fresh , timberline air .

If he blinks once , he 's got you totally figured out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Denver 's television special on the bighorn sheep of the Rockies established him with a sense of place and purpose that perhaps no other popular singer enjoys . If there are serious songs and thoughts , there are light ones too . A song about Toledo , Ohio , where the most exciting thing to do is " go to the bakery to watch the buns rise . " Wild cheers . Everyone in the audience seems to be from Toledo  --  or to have been to the bakery there , Another song , in mock dirge time , begs the singer 's heirs to take him when he 's gone to Forest Lawn . " I want to go simply when I 'm gone . " ? Now in the darkness of the Ohio hills , a sudden intimacy seems to sweep over the crowd and it is as though Denver were playing before the fire in a log cabin in the mountains he loves and you were the only one in the audience .

A method of long-range funding , to secure insulation from government pressure , is  --  more understandably than ever  --  near the top of that list . But that is only one part of the solution . Another is to increase the independence of local stations in their own communities , by winning a broader base of active community support . This means , first of all , that the forty million Americans who already watch public television must become more vocal in their support of its work . I emphasize again that this support need not imply total acceptance of every program on public TV . No one should be able to enjoy or accept school near his home .

If you want to change things , in the interest of better and more diverse television , it is your right  --  your obligation  --  to speak up . What public television ( and American television generally ) needs is not passive , unaware viewers . It needs people who care enough about what they see , and what they might see , to participate in making those changes possible . The great potential gift of public television is that it offers each citizen the opportunity to do just that . ZS worked sixteen hours , slept three .
