In Europe headlines announced the release of the Munich hostages , and in Israel people went to bed thinking that they had been saved . Millions of Americans who watched early-evening TV news programs on Tuesday came away with the impression that the athletes had been rescued . In a world of instantaneous communications , everyone knows the news-even when it is false . Rarely in recent years has a single news event been so misreported to so many people as the murders in Munich . <P> Still , it is difficult to put much of the blame on newsmen . Indeed many reporters , barred from the climactic scene , hesitated when word of the captives ' safe release first came from the Bavarian state police , who were responsible for security at the airport in Frstenfeldbruck . A few journalists were apparently misled when a local pub owner , Ludwig Pollack , passed a rumor near the airport gate that the terrorists had been seized ; from this it was inferred that the hostages were safe . But it was only after receiving confirmation from Conrad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that many reporters sent firm-and wrong - stories out to the world . <P> Charles Bietry , a reporter for Agence France Presse , was the first to send out the correct , tragic news after talking with Georg Kronawitter , the mayor of Munich . A.F.P. moved that report at 9:13 p.m . New York time , allowing the New York Times to be accurate in its first edition ( part of the first run of the Washington Post reported the hostages rescued ; the Post had earlier arranged to get A.F.P. service , but the teleprinter did not arrive until the next morning ) . U.S. television networks do not subscribe to A.F.P. During the official press conference , which began at about 10 p.m . E.D.T. , other reporters learned of the killings and Deutsche Presse-Agentur , the German press agency , corrected its earlier false report with a bulletin : " Alle Geiseln gettet . " <P> Chicago Style . Up to that point , the coverage of the tragedy had been an exercise in frustration , particularly for the TV networks , which were trying to provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept away from Building 31 , where the Israelis were being held . Later , at the airport , armed guards accompanied by attack dogs kept reporters and cameras outside the 6-ft. fence . <P> ABC , which had won coverage rights to the Olympic Games , started with a clear edge over its competitors . It had both a staff on the scene and a near monopoly of the transatlantic satellite . Thus it was ironic that ABC , which does not normally air network programs before noon , was the last of the TV networks to broadcast the initial news of the terrorist raid . <P> After that , ABC 's Jim McKay , ordinarily an overeffusive sportscaster , managed a restrained , effective tone , and Peter Jennings , the network 's Middle East correspondent-who had himself been held captive by Arab guerrillas for a few hours in May 1971 - provided valuable background information . Borrowing some lessons from old-style Chicago journalism , John Wilcox , a film producer for ABC Sports , donned a T shirt , U.S. track-team jacket and track shoes to sneak past the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposite Building 31 . From his hidden vantage point , he radioed reports on the activities of the Germans and the terrorists .
