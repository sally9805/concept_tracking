THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment F 4VERY few seasons , a pickup truck marked in bold letters " TREE PRESERVATION SERVICE " pulls into a suburban street we know about and deposits three or four outdoorsy men with ladders and saws who spend an invigorating hour or so lopping off tree branches that grow out over the road . A couple of times , we watched this operation with indulgence , only dimly wondering how it preserved the trees to thwart their reach for light and air . Then , recently , we learned we had been anaesthetized by a title . The Tree Preservation Service is in the service of Con Edison , and its concern is less for preserving the trees than for preserving the overhead wires into whose air space the branches sometimes intrude . All this is by way of explaining a suspicion we formed , even before we knew its contents , of a bill that Congress has been mulling over for two years and that now has the support of the Commerce Department . The bill is called the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competing newspapers to violate the anti-trust laws by pooling their profits and fixing prices . Its ostensible purpose is to shore up shaky papers , but it is most probably not a newspaper-preservation bill so much as a publishes-preservation bill . Any newspaper that has to be preserved this way might as well he preserved in formaldehy de . We are pained by the death of every newspaper , but an ad-hoc group that wr are proud to he a permanent member of and that we like to think of as the Liberty Preservation Society believes the public is better served by a dead paper than by one mortally sick and given a semblance of health through the : connivance of the competition that its voice should continually challenge and of the government about which it is duty-bound to speak the truth . The I'ndergraduate STROLLING west on Twelfth Street the other morning , we were hailed in front of the New School for Social Research by a sprightly lady wearing a purple pants suit under a tall black fur hat and a maxicoat . " Hi ! " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met in a coffee shop . Can you tell ? What do you think of this hat ! ' It 's fake- Russian sable . Remember me ? " We did . It was Janet , with whom , shout a year ago , we had accidentally attended a symposium for mature women interested in reentering the business world . " I 'm here to register for the spring semester , " Janet told us . " I need help . " She led the way inside , picked up a course catalogue and some folders from a table in the lobby , and proceeded into a streamlined lounge , where she doffed her coat and hat , sat down , and put on a pair of glasses with a crack running across the left lens . " Maybe you can help me decide what I should take , " she said . We sat down beside her , having forgotten where we were going anyway . There were two other people in the lounge -- a white-haired woman reading a book called " The Death Committee , " and a girl with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embroidered Greek bag onto a white Formica table . " Last semester , I signed up for four courses , " Janet was saying as we looked around , " hut I ended up taking only one .... What 's its name ? Oh , yes  --  History of Black Resistance . There are a lot of people resisting each other in the class  --  black and white and Jewish confrontation all the time . The course is with Julius Lester ; he 's a marvellous teacher . I 'm the oldest one in the class and I know the least . I lost all my notes in Blooming-dale's. / was taking back some bedspreads . " Janet paused to examine one of the folders she had picked up in the lobby " This one says ' The Young Adult Center , ' ' ' she said . " Actually , I think of myself as an old child . " She crumpled the folder up and looked at anoth er one . " ' Theodore Bikel , ' " she said . " Maybe I should take Folk Songs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course over again  --  the last three or four times I was n't listening , because I was busy analyzing the other people in the class . I 'm very interested in people . " She looked around the room for a moment before turning her attention to the catalogue . " This one sounds marvellous , " she said . " Look at that " ? she pointed to an item in the catalogue ? " ' The Film as a Social and Personal Document . ' I have n't seen any of these movies they mention ! ' Janet took her glasses off and dosed the catalogue . " The reason I did n't go to those other courses I signed up for was , for one thing , City Planning was at six o'clock , which is when I 'm feeding the kids , so that was no good , " she said , and added , " I did go twice . I was late both times . All you hear is how they ca n't do anything . But they could certainly plan to kill the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then , there was one with Max Lerner , but I was always marching on Washington when that one came up . And Fight Against Poverty . Actually , the only reason I did n't take that one is I forgot I had enrolled for it . They called me up at eight-thirty one night and said , ' Are n't you the ticket-taker for Fight Against Poverty ? ' " We looked confused . " I signed tip to be a ticket-taker in all four courses , " Janet explained . " That means you get there fifteen minutes ahead of time , you pick up the professor 's mail from the office and hand it to him , then you 're supposed to take tickets from the students . They wave them at you as they come into the classroom . I found out they only have to show the tickets  --  I was trying to take them . I was tipped off by my rich cousin that if you 're broke and want to study and ca n't afford it if your two kids are going to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my kids are on a part scholarship , and the rest I owe the school  --  you can he a ticket-taker . On a sixty-dollar course , they allow you fort ) dollars and you pay twenty . A thirty-dollar course you get for /II thing . " Janet put her glasses back on and opened the catalogue again . " On the other hand , " she said , looking up , " I do n't know how to get down here from West Eighty-sixth Street except by taxi , and that costs me more than I save being a ticket-taker . " The red-haired girl pulled a brush out of her Greek hag and began to brush her hair . " Anyway , they called me about Fight Against Poverty and I happened to be in bed , " Janet continued , picking up one thread of her discourse . " I 've never been in bed at eight o'cliwk in my life just that night . " She looked dis-gusted for a moment , and then continued , " This History of Black Resistance is a remarkable course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't remember any of it . I ca n't even remember the room number . We were assigned to do a paper . Everybody was writing about Frederick Douglass or the Civil War or Booker T. Washington  --  something intellectual . But I wanted to write about my own personal life , my own experiences on trains and things . " We nodded . Once again , Janet started to study the catalogue . " Oh , I 'm going to take this one ! " she said . " The Challenges of the Seventies , with David Schoenbrun . Only four sessions . That 's perfect for me . There 's no sex in it , though  --  all politics . Maybe there 's a discussion period , where you can talk about whatever you like . Here 's one called Sex and Art : Self-Obliteration . Gee , T do n't think that would be something to aim at . I heard it 's supposed to he self-fulfillment . Sex , that is  --  I do n't know about art . " We looked noncommittal . " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's taught by a Japanese person . Their approach is completely different . Now , here 's something called Open Evening . " Her voice rose and fell with excitement and doubt as she pored over the listings . " How about Male Dilemma and Female Quandary ? " We assumed a puzzled expression . " No , I do n't want to know about that , " she said . " Even if you knew about it , you could n't do anything about it . I want to do something . They wo n't let me do Casework with the Poor . Labor Relations Luncheons  --  the luncheon is three-fifty , and they throw in the course . I like the courses that include lunch , but it 's very hard to get that sort of thing in the evening . I would n't mind taking a language if you could skip the grammar part . Maybe I could just go from eleven-fifteen to eleven-forty-five for the coffee and conversation . " Janet put down the catalogue , took her glasses off , and sighed . " Gee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to do with the rest of my life . I still think I should take that Julius Lester course over again and this time read the books . I bought all the hooks for the course , but I never read any of them . You probably get more nut of it if you read the books . " We pursed our lips . Janet continued , " I asked Mr. Lester if I had to take the exam , and he said , ' Are you taking the course for credit ? ' I said , ' How many do I get ? ' Two , ' he said . I asked him , ' How many do you need to graduate from college ? ' He said , ' A hundred and twenty . ' Then I 'll only need a hundred and eighteen more , ' I said . He told me not to bother . One of my problems with this course is that I do n't want to get too dressed up , and I 'm too old to be a hippie , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class . Last night , I wore bluejeans and a shirt I had painted the house in . Nobody paid any attention . I looked just like all those little rich kids who are trying to look poor . Also , I think I have a crush on the professor . I do n't like to sound superficial ; it just happens that I am . Once , I brought him an apple . No , I brought him an ashtray  --  he smokes too much . But another girl brought him an ashtray , too , and I missed a lot of the lecture trying to see whose ashtray he was using . I really should be learning how to cook and sew instead of all this stuff , in case anybody ever wants to marry me again , but ? " She stopped to consider the idea . " I am looking for a cook , " she said . " If he happens to be a man , marry him . Hey , listen to this one ! " Janet was back in the catalogue . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " ' With Father Anthony Schillaci , a Dominican Friar and leader in the underground church . ' He sounds like something out of ' Robin Hood . ' I may know him . " We sat back in our chair and unbuttoned our coat . The lobby was filling up with people of both sexes and various ages , most of them wearing fur hats and hoots , and there was one girl with a long African dress and sandals showing below a fur coat . Janet was scribbling something in a notebook . " O.K. , " she was saying to herself , " I 'll sign up for Folk Songs of the City , Human Power and Aggression , and Challenges of the Seventies . " She stood up . " Let 's go . " Brandishing her notebook and the catalogue , she led us out of the lounge , across a courtyard , and into the lobby of the New School 's Eleventh Street building , where the registrars were set up for business , with sober expressions and an orderly arrangement of desks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dedicated students . " I want to be a ticket-taker for Folk Songs of the City , " Janet announced to the girl at the table just inside the entrance . " You 'll have to go to the Ticket-Takers ' Office , on the third floor , " said the girl . " Oh , good ! " Janet said . " Maybe I can get my money hack for City Planning . " Janet led us through the courtyard again , into an elevator , along a corridor , and down a flight of stairs to the third-floor office , where a woman with a deceptively easygoing manner first rejected Janet 's request for a refund ( " Too late .... Yes , it 's a shame " ) , then talked her out of Folk Songs of the Cits , . and Human Power and Aggression , and persuaded her to make her selections from a list of numbers indicating courses with openings for ticket-takers . " We need someone for three-o-two , three-n-three , three-o-four , twelve ... " the woman said . " What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " . three-o-eight , three-sixteen , THE NEW YORKER 27 three-eighteen , " said the woman . " What 's a good night for you ? " " Are n't we doing this backward ? " Janet asked . " Oh , well , four and eight are my favorite numbers ; let me see what those are . I ca n't do anything at six o'clock . I have to cook dinner for my c h ild re n . " " Here 's something , " the woman said . " Thursday at eight-ten , three-sixteen . " Janet consulted the catalogue . " ' Legal Aspects of Housing in New York , ' " she read . " No , I could n't do that . Hmm , three-eighteen , that is n't bad . Three-o-two I could do , that 's interesting  --  Black Citizens in New York . " " Well , you want three-o-two ? " the woman asked sternly . " Gee ! " Janet said . " Three-a-seven sounds fascinating . You did n't mention that one , did you ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've already got a lot of people for that one . " " But it says here it does n't start till April , " Janet said . " How do all those people know what they 'll he doing in April ? My birthday 's in April , " she added . " How about ... O.K. , I 'll take twelve and three-o-two . It 's so marvellous learning things late in life . " The woman asked for Janet 's name , address , and phone number . " Do you have a business number ? " she asked . " No , I do n't , " Janet said . " I do n't even have a business . " " Here you are , then , " the woman said , handing Janet two ticket-taker registration cards . " You have two courses there that wo n't cost you anything . " Back in the lobby of the Eleventh Street building , Janet had second thoughts . " Black Citizens in New York , " she said reflectively . " I do n't want to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Look at this three-o-seven , " she said , pointing in the catalogue . " ' Civil Disorders and Civil Liberties , eight sessions , Mondays , eight-ten to nine-fifty P.m . ' That 's the perfect course for me  --  the right time and the right night . " We shrugged slightly and frowned in sympathy . Janet looked at the cards the woman had given her to fill nut . " I should go back there right now and have these changed , " she said . " Oh , God , this is the same thing I did last semester ! Let 's get out of here ! " We followed Janet out onto Twelfth Street , buttoning our coat . " You know , everybody thinks I went to Vassar and Smith , but I never graduated from anywhere  --  not even from high school , " she said as we headed toward Fifth Avenue . " The last school I went to was the Northampton School for Girls , and they never recovered from it . One day , the headmistress told me , ' Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant as a challenge , but I accepted it as a fact and I never learned another thing . " At the corner of Fourteenth Street , we waved goodbye to Janet , who was racing after a cab , and turned toward Sixth Avenue , figuring that sooner or later we would remember where we had been going in the first place . ? ARICHMOND , Virginia , friend of ours was about to tear off the upper portion of a bill she had received from a local veterinary hospital for services rendered to her elderly , ailing terrier and enclose it with her check when she noticed a line in fine print reading , " Medicare patients send entire bill and request a receipt . " Ocean Pollution THE ocean is so large that few people , even among conserva-tionists , have worried much about its becoming polluted , except along the ? shore . Nonetheless , oil pollution , for one , is already widespread in mid-ocean , and some scientists have concluded that the size of the ocean makes it more , rather than less , vulnerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DDT . Recently , we put in a call to one of these scientists  --  Dr. Max Blumer , an organic chemist and a Senior Scientist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution . " The amount of tar  --  the residue of an oil spill on the surface of the sea already equals the amount of its surface plant life , " Dr. Winer said . " My colleague Dr. Richard Backus , who has supervised several of our ocean-going expeditions , can tell you more about this . Come up and see us . " A few days later , we did just that . Woods Hole is a very small community , with a grocery store , a drugstore , a large restaurant , several small restaurants , a small boatyard , a small yacht club , a small bookstore ( some of ? these were closed for the season ) , and three large laboratories the Oceano-graphic institution , which is the largest and newest ; the Marine Biological Laboratory ; and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service laboratory . There was an unpolluted coat of snow over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be seen the masts of large research vessels and small fishing boats . We found Dr. Backus on the ground floor of the Marine Sciences Building , where he studies the habits of fish . Blue-eyed , brown-haired , dolphin-nosed , and weathered by voyages , he snatched a seaman 's blue knitted cap off his head , handed a voluminous computer print-out to an associate , and led us into a tiny , book-lined inner office . " These arc beauties , " Dr. Backus said , handing us two bottles containing gooey , golf-ball-size black globs floating in a liquid and trailing sticky-looking streamers . " That 's what we get . These are comparatively firm . I wish they all were . We picked them up in our neuston nets . Neuston are minute organisms that inhabit the upper few centimetres of the water at night and live as deep as two thousand feet by day . We started towing neuston nets in 1964 . Right away , we began noticing the tar fouling the nets . These tar halls are picked up by the nets , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  thank God . We made them to get fish . Unquestionably , a principal source of the oil is ships pumping their bilge or tankers flushing their tanks . The amount varies , but I ca n't think of anywhere I 've been in the Atlantic or the Mediterranean or the Caribbean where we have n't found it . I think the highest concentration we found was off Libya . We estimate that in heavy concentrations there is as much as half a cubic centimetre  --  a lump as big as a pencil eraser  --  on every square yard of sea surface . We 've found tar in the stomachs of fish --  -- sauries --  -- that are fed on by all larger fish . The toxic chemicals must get spread around very widely they get absorbed by both plants and animals . God knows what the effects are . Blumer will tell you something about that . " We went up some stairs and found Dr. Blumer and several associates in a large laboratory ; he led us into a small office with a large window overlooking an inner harbor where sailboats covered with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neat , good-looking , dark-haired man in his forties . He is Swiss-horn , he told us , and has been studying hydrocarbons at Woods Hole for ten years . " Hydrocarbons are extremely persistent , " Dr. Blumer said . " Once incorporated in the flesh , they remain forever , and are passed on through the whole chain of predators . For instance , in certain animals we may find hydrocarbons characteristic of algae found in a particular area , so we know that , directly or indirectly , the algae of that area are part of their diet . All living organisms manufacture hydrocarbons themselves , but the hydrocarbons in the petroleum spilled in the ocean each year already exceed the natural production . It is quite a serious problem . " We asked what the oil dumped in the ocean did to the fish and other forms of life . " In mid-ocean , it 's very hard to assess the effects of anything , " Blumer said . " The currents move the stuff around . The animals move . However , the effects can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an oil spill , the toxic volatile fractions of the oil evaporate very quickly , and that the rest  --  tar  --  is inert , though messy . This is not so . Backus has given us tar samples that have been in the ocean from two to six months , and they still contain the toxic fractions  --  paraffins , benzenes , toluenes . A substantial part of any oil spill goes into solution in the water , and it is toxic  --  indeed , the most toxic fractions are the most soluble . This affects all organisms  --  from phytoplankton to basking sharks . Most of the world 's oil is transported by sea in established shipping lanes . A tenth of one per cent , at least  --  a minimum of a million tons a year  --  is spilled or flushed or leaked just in transport and port operations . Half the seafood of the world comes from one-tenth of one per cent of the area of the sea  --  chiefly the coastal areas , which are most subject to pollution . For instance , one-quarter of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Large parts of the ocean are deserts , and always will be , so we ca n't hope to harvest food from other parts of the sea while we go on polluting the most fruitful areas . There are two kinds of instant damage from any oil spill : first , the immediate kill by the toxic fractions ; second , the pollution of the animals that are not killed , rendering them unfit for human nutrition . And there are two other matters of concern . Because hydrocarbons are stable in the food chain and are concentrated as they are passed on , one wonders if carcinogens , for instance , may eventually become concentrated to the point of danger . The final aspect may be the most difficult of all to deal with . Organic chemical compounds , which appear in the ocean in a few parts per billion , play many roles , and certain elements of petroleum mimic them very closely . Many fish find food or mates or their spawning grounds through smell . The salmon has a very acute sense of smell . A starfish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a concentration of one part to a billion parts of water . The addition of a million tons of oil a year , stirred by ocean currents , may relatively quickly produce could have already produced , for all we know  --  wholesale pollution sufficient to block the finding of mates , food , or habitats , or to provide false stimuli for these . Kerosene was long ago used to attract lobsters , and was declared illegal . Once oil is spilled , most remedies make things worse . It was the tragedy of the Torrey Canyon affair that the dispersant used was particularly toxic itself . Many of the newer dispersants are touted as ' non-toxic . ' But a detergent  --  even a truly non-toxic one  --  breaks up the oil from a large slick into small droplets , which simply go into solution faster and in greater quantity . Many little animals will eat any particle of a certain size , and will consequently eat these droplets where they would not eat from a large slick . In the long run , after much of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Detergents kill bacteria . Some people are working on seeding spills with bacteria , but no single strain of bacteria works on all components of the oil , and the part that is neutralized first is the least toxic . Various substances have been used to sink an oil slick . and the oil does disappear from the surface , but then it destroys the bottom fauna  --  shellfish and bottom feeders , like cod . On the whole , short of prevention , I believe the most satisfactory way now of dealing with oil in the ocean is to burn it -- which , of course , pollutes the air . Theoretically , cleaning up is the responsibility of the polluter , but today , unless a ship is wrecked , the polluter is rarely brought to account . It is quite easy , however , to identify chemically the source of even a small spill , though I 'm not aware that the technique is in use anywhere . Oils from different sources are themselves different ; petroleum companies have devoted a
