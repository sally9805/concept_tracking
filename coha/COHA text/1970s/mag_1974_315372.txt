" exclaims one mustachioed cop bending over the bag . " Look at this .

" Why did he change ? " I used to ignore the stories . But when the headlines hit-COP ARRESTED-it bothered me . I would go to cocktail parties and mumble , ' I work for the city ' when people asked what I did for a living . Maybe it was the cocktail parties that made me change . I do n't know .
