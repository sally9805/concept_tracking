One relief pitcher touts a comic strip featuring a zany resembling himself . The first baseman is renowned for raising hell and racing thoroughbreds . The second and third basemen are hosts of a radio show . Other players dabble in transcendental meditation . But none of that for the single-minded leftfielder who gets his kicks from brutalizing a baseball with a 36-oz. bat . <P> The kicks have been rapid-fire this season because no one is bashing the ball like Gregory Michael Luzinski , 24 , of the Philadelphia Phillies . Called " Bull " in deference to his taurine power , Luzinski leads the National League in home runs , runs batted in , 26 and 88 respectively last week , and bullying pitchers . That parlay keeps the Phillies winning and within striking distance of the Pittsburgh Pirates . It also has Phillies fans planning for the playoffs . <P> Through no fault of his own , the Bull 's emergence has come as a surprise . In 1973 he hit 29 home runs , but few noticed because the Phillies were deep in last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knee and lost half a season . This spring the Phillies grabbed First Baseman Dick Allen , who led the American League in home runs and controversial publicity last year , and taciturn Greg was again forgotten . But only briefly . Luzinski , for one , is not surprised by his showing . " Basically , " he says , " I 'm just playing up to my ability . " <P> Gentle Giant . Son of an electrician in Chicago , Luzinski lit up North Side Hamlin Park from the day he first stepped up to bat . In high school , he also played linebacker and fullback , and led his team to two undefeated seasons . The football recruiters , envisioning another Dick Butkus , swamped him with offers . Says he : " John McKay called to ask me to come to U.S.C. the day I signed with the Phillies . " The club 's pitch included a bonus of about $50,000 . <P> At 6 ft. 1 in. , 225 Ibs. , Luzinski looks more the linebacker than the leftfielder . But he is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thumb by comparison , calls him " fat boy " with impunity , and Shortstop Larry Bowa gets away with announcing that " if Dave and I were playing for the Reds , Johnny Bench would have 120 runs batted in by now . " But Bowa also remembers the time he goaded the Bull once too often . " He came at me , I ducked , and he hit John Vukovich instead . Then I ran into the bathroom and locked the door . " <P> Luzinski prefers to direct his aggression at a baseball . " I enjoy crushing it and hitting it out of the yard , " he says . His 26th home run this season , over the center-field fence of Busch Stadium in St. Louis , was hit so hard that Fellow Slugger Allen could remember only one other with which to compare it . Says Allen : " My first year in the Eastern League there was a guy who could shoot a ball high from a cannon , jump into a Jeep , drive to center field , jump out and catch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the center-field wall . He pulled the cord and the ball was gone . That 's what Greg 's shot looked like . "
