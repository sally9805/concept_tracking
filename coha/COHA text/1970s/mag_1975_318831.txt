As President Ford planned to go parading in West Virginia , four former presidential candidates appeared before a Senate subcommittee last week to belittle the political impact of such showboating and crowd-pumping . " I shook 5,000 hands in one day and got the hell beat out of me , " Republican Senator Barry Goldwater bluntly told the group , which was holding public hearings on how to reduce the risk of assassination attempts . He added : " I question whether any candidate , especially an incumbent , really has to get out and shake hands . " <P> So why do candidates and Presidents do it ? " Most of it is done to accommodate the photographers , " Democrat Hubert Humphrey frankly told the committee . " We want the pictures showing all those hands reaching out . " But , he said , " it is not necessary . " Democratic Senator George McGovern saw three reasons why such touring is so popular : <P> " 1 ) It is symbolic of getting close to the people ; 2 ) it raises the candidate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out and shake hands with a lot of smiling people who are potential voters ; 3 ) and now , to prove you 're brave . " <P> Insisted the soundly defeated 1972 candidate : " None are very good reasons . <P> None have much to do with the national interest . " <P> What should be done to reduce the risk ? McGovern suggested that a dialogue between President and people could better be accomplished by give-and-take discussions with community groups in more easily protected auditoriums . He urged more television debates and press conferences . Goldwater said simply : " I want my President to stay in the White House . " <P> Goldwater favored stiffer punishments . Anyone found carrying even an unloaded gun near a President should be given a mandatory ten-year term on top of any other judicial sentence , he said . Democratic Senator Edmund Muskie objected to electronic screening and suggested that the best practical measure is to get the candidates to " limit themselves much more than they do . " <P> Humphrey urged that any people who give " any indication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a President should be followed " like a shadow-like a private eye . " <P> Futile Attempts . That is often impossible , but it certainly was not attempted by the Secret Service in the case of Sara Jane Moore . Subcommittee Chairman Joseph Montoya demanded to know why . Although Secret Service agents interviewed her for 90 minutes the night before she shot at Ford , Moore " exhibited no mental aberrations that would give us reason " to follow her , according to the testimony of James T. <P> Burke , the agency 's assistant director for intelligence . Special Agent Gary S. Yauger , who led the questioning of Moore , said she showed " no animosity to the President or the Ford Administration " and no " sign of mental instability . " He added : " With the facts I had at the time of Sara Jane 's interview , I definitely do n't think I was wrong , and I 'd make the same decision again . "                 @ @ @ @
