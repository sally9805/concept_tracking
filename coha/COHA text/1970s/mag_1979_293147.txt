But both his friends and foes talked of lack of leadership <P> Rarely had a U.S. President seemed so strikingly mired in indecision . Just back from the ineffectual Tokyo summit , Jimmy Carter last week scheduled a major address on energy policy , telling aides that he wanted a " bold new approach . " Then , just 30 hours before he was supposed to go before the TV cameras , he called off the speech without a word of explanation and holed up at Camp David . Behind in Washington he left baffled aides with almost nothing that they could say for certain-except that the President had gone fishing . <P> By week 's end Carter 's aides were insisting that he was in a whirlwind of activity at the presidential hideaway , though there still seemed to be little sense of direction to what was taking place . The President summoned his top political advisers-essentially the Georgia Mafia - eight Governors and assorted energy experts , environmentalists , labor bosses , businessmen and congressional leaders . In what was a kind of " domestic summit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other issues . <P> Nonetheless , there was an unstoppable drumbeat of rumors echoing through Washington : the President was somehow settling the 1980 nomination question with Ted Kennedy ; the President was shaking up his White House staff , perhaps firing top aides ; the President was having a mental breakdown ; the President was preparing to resign . As Washington waited , the dollar plunged on international financial markets . The New York Post summed up the spreading bewilderment by demanding , in its blackest front-page type : WHAT THE HECK ARE YOU UP TO , MR . PRESIDENT ? <P> If Carter is to pull his presidency out of its nosedive and have a fighting chance of being renominated and re-elected in 1980 , he will have to come down from the Catoctin Mountains with a dramatic answer to that question because at week 's end the explanation for the Camp David mystery seemed to be nothing more-or less-than a spectacular display of White House ineptitude , followed by a desperate , last-gasp scramble to salvage something from the wreckage . By all indications from Administration aides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only 30 hours before he was to go on prime-time TV , that he was unprepared to say very much . In part , this was because of deep divisions among his advisers on energy policy . And he seemed strangely unaware of the uproar that his decision would touch off . Said a top aide of Carter 's reaction to the Washington speculation : " He thinks it 's funny . " <P> But Carter 's political advisers realized that he had to patch together some kind of program quickly . The official line on the Camp David discussions was that they were being held in a relaxed atmosphere , sometimes on the deck around the swimming pool adjoining Aspen Lodge . The President went jogging Saturday morning with some of the Governors he had invited to the retreat and his guests later reported that he was in a buoyant mood . In Washington , however , some Government officials were calling the domestic summit a watershed in the Carter presidency , a last chance to reverse the widespread impression that he is simply not competent to lead the nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advisers : " They 're scared .
