BROWNIE is sleeping in the audience when the kids come in . It 's impossible to wake him . ALICE enters . ALICE Has anyone seen my dog , Brownie ? ( Before she can sort out what the kids are telling her , ALICE whistles very loudly . BROWNIE leaps to his feet , startled ) BROWNIE I wish you would n't whistle . A whistle is a very loud sound . A very startling sound . I prefer a quiet sound myself . I have a very quiet name , after all . You could call like this : ( softly ) Here , Brownie . . . Here , Brownie . . . I like the name Brownie . It 's probably the nicest name in the world because it is a soft sound . Loud sounds scare me . ALICE What are we going to do today , Brownie ? Go visit Mrs. Nishimura ? BROWNIE No . ALICE Mr. Rubinek ? BROWNIE No . ALICE No , because they are arguing again , are n't they ? Over what to call the town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argue . ALICE Because one wants to call it one thing and one wants to call it another thing . Because Mrs. Nishimura wants to call it a Japanese name . And Mr. Rubinek wants to call it after the town he came from in Czechoslovakia . p. 3 BROWNIE Where 's Czechoslovakia ? ALICE ( who does n't know ) Now , you see , that 's exactly why Mr. Rubinek wants to call our town the same name as his town . To make you think about Czechoslovakia and to help you remember where it is . BROWNIE They could call it Brownie . To remember me. ( he savours the sound ) Brownie . ALICE Towns are named after famous people who discover inventions . BROWNIE Why ? ALICE ( who does n't know ) Or people who do something brave . BROWNIE Why ? ALICE It 's an honour , Brownie . To have a town named after you . BROWNIE Why not honour a friendly dog ? ALICE ( impatient ) Oh , Brownie , why not honour all of us ?

No one knows the name of our town . We do n't have mailmen . ( This fascinating exposition is interrupted by two karate yells as MRS . NISHIMURA and MR . RUBINEK enter and take positions at opposite ends of the acting area . Apparently , they are prepared for battle . BROWNIE is frozen with fear . He whimpers ) NISHIMURA Hai ! RUBINEK Hai ! ALICE Do n't fight ! BROWNIE Do n't fight ! RUBINEK ( coldly ) Oh , we are n't fighting , Alice . NISHIMURA ( coldly ) What do we have to fight about ? ( MR . RUBINEK and MRS . NISHIMURA seem to be having some sort of contest .

RUBINEK And this afternoon , I have challenged Mrs. Nishimura to a soccer match . I learned to play soccer in Czechoslovakia . BROWNIE People yell a lot playing soccer . NISHIMURA Yesterday , I taught Mr. Rubinek origami , which is folding paper into different shapes . The day before that I taught Mr. Rubinek the Japanese tea ceremony . . . BROWNIE Quiet . That sounds peaceful . RUBINEK And last night I took Mrs. Nishimura to a wonderful Czech film and we listened to the gypsy violins . BROWNIE The gentle violins . . . ( MR . RUBINEK and MRS .

Keeping busy makes a lot of noise . ALICE We could all stay home . One day . And drink tea and eat buchta . RUBINEK From my home town of Lipnik . NISHIMURA Tea is drunk in Japan in a very special way . RUBINEK The best buchta in the world comes from my home town of Lipnik . Lipnik should certainly be remembered and I 'm glad you agree . When we call our town Lipnik perhaps we could put up a statue of a buchta . BROWNIE ( to the kids ) That 's the silliest thing I ever heard . Who knows what a buchta looks like . That 's right . It 's sticky . Who ever heard of a sticky statue ? NISHIMURA When we call the town Choi , perhaps we could put up a statue of a karate black belt . Hai !

Then I 'll tell you why I want to call our town Choi . Then you 'll decide . BROWNIE That seems fair enough . ALICE All right . RUBINEK ( producing a sheaf of notes ) I 'm not prepared . ALICE Speech ! Speech ! BROWNIE Quiet , please ! ( RUBINEK smiles . He does not speak well in public , but he likes the attention . He begins to drone through his speech . BROWNIE immediately falls asleep . Very noisily ) RUBINEK My friends . My neighbours . Townspeople . We have gathered here today to decide a matter of great importance . What will we call our town ? What other town would we like to remember day by day as we live here in our new home . There is but one answer . Lipnik ! Lipnik is a town we should honour with remembrance . Home of the buchta .

( RUBINEK , NISHIMURA and ALICE return from one of the stores with black coats , black hats and string ) NISHIMURA Tell the story about the man who makes the buchta . ALICE And I will take the recipe . BROWNIE And the story should have a lesson to it . RUBINEK Once there was and was not , in the town of Lipnik , a baker named Herschel . BROWNIE That 's me . RUBINEK That 's Alice . One morning , Herschel got up and he put on his big black hat . . . ( which ALICE does ) and he put on his long black coat .

BROWNIE I 'm always your dog , Brownie . RUBINEK There was something that worried Moshe . BROWNIE There 's one thing that bothers me and that 's the part where everybody has a part but me .

When they get to the end of the song they start all over at the beginning for as long as is necessary to create confusion and chaos ) All the men of Lipnik Look very much the same With big black hats and long black coats Say , what 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baker . NISHIMURA I 'm Moshe the tailor . RUBINEK I 'm Josele the shoemaker .

NISHIMURA ( confusion growing ) He 's Herschel the baker . RUBINEK ( still more confusion ) She 's Josele the shoemaker . ( Confusion and shuffling around goes on for one more round ) When Herschel goes out walking You see him on the street He looks exactly like his friends He goes on walks to meet ALICE How do I know who I am ? BROWNIE You look like Alice dressed up like Herschel the baker . ALICE How do I know that I 'm Herschel the baker ? BROWNIE You could tie a red string around your leg . ALICE That 's a wonderful idea . BROWNIE It is ? ( ALICE ties a red string aroung her leg ) RUBINEK Herschel , why do you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can tell who I am . As long as I have this string around my leg , I can tell I 'm Herschel the baker . p. 14 NISHIMURA That 's a wonderful idea . BROWNIE Is it ? NISHIMURA May I try it ? ALICE Sure you can . ( As MRS . NISHIMURA reties the string ) Now you 're Herschel the baker . RUBINEK ( to NISHIMURA ) Herschel , why do you have that string tied around your leg ? NISHIMURA So I know who I am . ALICE Wait a minute ! RUBINEK ( to NISHIMURA ) That 's a wonderful idea . May I try it ? NISHIMURA Certainly . ( MR . RUBINEK ties the string around his leg ) ALICE ( to BROWNIE ) She 's not Herschel . I 'm Herschel . BROWNIE You do n't have a red string tied around your leg . ALICE No , but he does .

Who am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the baker never discovered who he was . p. 15 BROWNIE It 's simple . RUBINEK And he wandered all over the world trying to find out who he was and what he should do . BROWNIE Look , Alice , the thing is that Mr. Rubinek has your string tied around his leg and that 's why you 're confused . ( BROWNIE unties the string and gives it to ALICE ) ALICE I 'm Herschel ! RUBINEK Everywhere he went , Herschel asked : " Who am I and where should I go ? " ALICE Look , Mr. Rubinek , I 'm Herschel . RUBINEK ( almost in tears ) And Herschel never again came back to Lipnik which is the most beautiful town in the world . BROWNIE I think Choi is a very nice name . I think Lipnik is a very nice name . I just wish that we could pick one name . NISHIMURA So I could go on vacation . RUBINEK So I could be a mailman . BROWNIE So we would n't have to fight anymore .

So she called him Tiki Tiki Tembo No Sa Rembo Hari Bari Brookski Peri Pen Do Hiki Pon Pom Nicki No Meano Dom Bari Ko . ( There should be a hand-clapping game to go with this long name . It makes it easier to remember ) p. 17 BROWNIE That 's the silliest thing I ever heard of . NISHIMURA Because it was the custom in Japan . The more you liked someone , the more names you would give him . BROWNIE What was the second child called ? NISHIMURA Choi . BROWNIE My name is Brownie . NISHIMURA People do n't name their children that way anymore . BROWNIE I do n't like to complain , but Brownie is not a very long name . ALICE It 's just as long as Alice .
