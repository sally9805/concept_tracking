txt It was a bright , beautiful day here today , but the sunshine did n't go over too well with some . Bad ice and bad skating are bad news most any time in this The Talk northern Chicago of suburb , but it was Northbrook , singularly inappropriate today as the town laid out a heroine 's welcome for the twit hometown skaters . Dianne Holum and Anne Henning , who together won half of the United States ' eight Winter Olympics medals . The two medal winners shared honors with three other Northbrook skaters who also were on the 17-member Olympic skating team coached by Ed Rudolph , the energetic Northbrook resident who is generally credited with developing ice sports here to the point that the town can now call itself " Speed Skating Capital of the World . " " The sun , " groused one of the village 's 27,000 residents , " is killing the ice . It 'll be rotten skating . " The melting ice did n't dampen spirits . The two Olympic gold medal winners and their teammates arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 300 fans and Mayor Richard J. Daley of Chicago at nearby O'Hare International Airport . Miss Henning , 16 years old , and Miss Holum , 20 , appeared tired and a hit overwhelmed as they left the airplane . But within moments Miss Henning , the 500-meter sprintskating winner , and Miss Holum , the 1,500-meter skat- ing winner , gave way to laughter and excitement among their young friends . They then rode in a horntooting motorcade to Northbrook , where they were greeted by fireworks and a crowd estimated by the police at about 8,000 . And at the outdoor Meadow Hill Ice Rink , the scene of local triumphs , the young skaters were showered with flowers and praise while the ice melted around the chilly feet of their admirers . Other Passions In downtown Northbrook , every store flashed a congratulatory sign . All 14 schools were shut tight and some businesses hooded their registers and closed their doors . But one ' thing that did n't shut down on this poor day for : skating at Northbrook 's two outdoor rinks was the Sports Complex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The people here Just would n't stand for it , " said Frances Plummer , the head skating teacher . In fact , the skating rink , . which was approved in a bond referendum , is rarely closed at all . Weekdays it runs at least 20 hours a day . On weekends the ice is busy around the clock . There are beginners ' skating lessons ( over 1,400 enroll in each 10-week session ) , figure skating ( the rink  --  opens at 5 A.M. for practice ) , ice hockey ( eight leagues , beginning at age 5 ) , and the annual ice show  --  with of course , a cast of a thousand . But though Northbrook provides the coach and five of the United States team 's 17 members , skating is not the town 's only passion . " This is just a nutty sports , town , " said Mrs Genny Adsit . On that sad day in May when the indoor ice I goes away , the tennis courts fill up , traffic grows heavy on the Olympic bike track and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Northbrook is , in short , an affluent sports  --  minded suburb where almost everyone believes that the family that plays together stays together . The Book Bin , the local bookstore , sells more sports books than any other kind . It is a far cry from the wee village of Shermerville that a band of industrious German farmers founded in the mid-1880 's . In fact , it 's a far cry from the village of Northbrook that many residents knew ' only 12 years ago . Since then it has doubled in population , and like dozens of other Chicago suburbs such as Wheeling , Buffalo Grove and Lombard , has found its 1970 census already woefully outdated . Housing developers are quickly buying up the remaining farmlands and golf courses . Property that once sold for $1.50 an acre now goes for upwards of $40,000 . And the local welcoming hostess . Mrs. Carol Bergey , makes at least a dozen calls a week now at the brightly colored , two-story , twogarage homes springing up in Northbrook 's 11.5 square miles . One survey put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over $16,000 , ranking Northbrook among Chicago 's 10 wealthiest suburbs , There is some friction here between a minority of long ' time residents who want the village ( Northbrookians do not use the word city or town ) to stay the same and the overwhelming majority of later arrivals , who are bringing change . " Change is inevitable , " says John C. Williams , the village president , " even if you do n't like it . " But there is no friction over skating . " We come out as often as possible , " said Jack Lofstrom as he stood in a long line at the indoor rink . His daughter , Becky , 3 , and son Jeff , 4 , tugged at his sleeves to get on the ice , Another son , Mark , 8 , was at home with a banged knee suffered in hockey practice . ' Great Family Sport ' " Like all our friends , " Mr. Lofstrom said , " we carry our skating stuff to church on Sunday . We 're out of there at 10:30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great family sport . " Suddenly 9-year-old James Dickman smashed into the ice , breaking his left arm . " You mean we have to go home ? " he asked his father . One resident said , " Northbrook is still very friendly and very child-oriented . You do n't see parents dropping their children off to skate ; they come , too . ' We may have grown into a big suburb , but we 've kept a lot . of the friendly qualities and.pride in youth that you do n't see in the big city . " Many such families were attracted to Northbrook by its reputation for good schools and athletic facilities . The athletics are overseen by the Park District , an elected board that can levy its own taxes . One recent study found that 75 per cent of Northbrook 's population was involved with one Park District activity or another . For many years Ed Rudolph , the skating team coach , has been a Park District commissioner and is generally credited here with pushing development of the ice rink , bike track and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the skating growth , " said Chip Maze , a Park District official , " but he was operating in mighty fertile sports ground . These parents really believe in sports for their children . Sports teach them discipline , self-confidence and teamwork . And if you 're out ice skating , you 're not getting into any other trouble . " Everyone Knows Them These days it seems everyone in town knows the two skating stars . " I used to see them at 7 in the morning out running , " said Steve Meyer . Another youth added , " They 're always training . I do n't think they know what a boy looks like . " Their Olympic success has already boosted the rink 's waiting list for skating lessons to over 500 . " When I was little , I wanted to be like Sonja Henie , " said Mrs. Gisella Pulf as she picked up skating application forms . " Now my daughter has to be like Anne and Dianne . " Tomorrow everything should be back to normal in Northbrook . That is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in session , and the ice rink will still be crowded . And , oh yes , the skating team leaves for Europe for another round of tournaments .
