txt Negotiators for the United Mine Workers union and the major coal operators agreed today on a new contract proposal . Union leaderg , calling the terms significantly improved , said that they expected it to win membership approval in about 10 days , ending the 14-week miners ' strike . Proposals that came off the bargaining table on Feb. 6 and Feb. 24 were rejected by the union 's 39-member bargaining council and by the membership , respectively . This third agreement goes late tomorrow to the bargaining council , which is expected to approve it , opening the way for a rank-and-file ratification vote next week . Although no details of the new settlement were disclosed publicly by either side today , it appeared from the private comments of both union and industry officials that the coal operators had " gotten the message , " as one union member said , of the 2-to-1 membership vote against the second version 10 days ago . The new settlement was significantly less objectionable to the miners , union leaders said , particularly in regard to health and pension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason for the earlier rejection . " If this is explained . right to the membership , they 'll go for it , " said Tom Shoemake , a U.M.W. district official in West Frankfort , Ill . " With the new provisions , the contract will fly , " agreed Norman Beattie , a field representative in the union 's southern Illinois region . Asked today if he expected membership approval of the new contract , Arnold R. Miller , the union 's president , said , " I think so , I think so . " The break in the coal talks , deadlocked almost constantly since negotiations began here Oct. 6 , came in the strike 's 99th day . ? Nicholas T. Cam:cia , the chairman and chief executive officer of the Pittston Company who took charge of the divided industry bargaining team three weeks ago , appeared at 3:15 P.M. with Mc . Miller at a jammed news conference in the lobby of the Capital Hilton Hotel , the negotiating headquarters . At a preceding three-and-a-half-hour meeting , the negotiators reportedly merely formalized and signed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy to report to you that we have bargained long and hard and had many difficulties , but we finally agreed to a tentative agreement , " said // Mr. Camicia , himself a former union miner . " We hope that within a very short time Mr. Miller can present it to the bargaining council and then go through the process " of membership ratification . " But we think that we have a package that will be very good for the union and very good for the country , and get our mines back to work and get this country on its feet , " he concluded . 25-Cent Increase Compared with the Feb .. 6 offer , today 's terms would cost the coal companies about 25 cents an hour more per man over three years . Asked whether " this is a good contract from the industry 's point of view , " Mr. Camicia laughed , paused a moment and replied , " Well , it 's a good contract from everybody 's point of view . " The rejected three-year contract would have meant a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; informed analysts said today that the new terms would mean a 38.8 percent rise in costs over three years . In increased wages and benefits per man-hour over the three years , the two rejected proposals offered the miners $4.72 and $4.75 ; the new one reportedly offers $4.97 . Moreover , in the new pact , more than half the three-year cost increase comes in the first year . The proposal reportedly faces little or no opposition among members of the union bargaining council , who approved the proposal 10 days ago by a 25 to 25 to 13 vote . Although knowledgeable sources described the new plan as having measurable gains over earlier , versions , it still contained what one informed official called " some hookers . " Gains in Benefits The , reported gains were the following : 41Health benefit deductibles , fees to be paid by miners and their dependents in place of the longtime fully paid medical plan financed by the coal companies , were ' reduced to $200 from as much as $700 a year for each family . There would be no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $150 a year for physicians ' charges and up to $50 a year for drugs . Retired miners would pay no more than $150 a year , $100 for doctors ' charges and $50 for prescriptions . Both groups of miners would pay a fee of $7.50 for each visit to a doctor , meaning that miners would not receive the full-cost coverage of the prestrike medical plan until after 20 visits to physicians . ( IThe pension payments to about 81,000 union , members who retired before 1976 , /which under the rejected proposal would have risen from $225 to $275 a month in 1980 , were to go to $275 a month immediately . This would still leave a large discrepancy between these pensions and the payments of up to $500 a month received by more recent retirees , but it was a step toward the " pension equalization " . demanded by those who rejected the last proposal . 9Health coverage for miners ' widows , available for one month after the death under the rejected proposal , would be extended to five years . Among men who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industrial vocation , this was regarded as important . 9An industry plan for a one-week Christmas vacation would be abandoned in favor of up to four " personal " days off , to be taken whenever a miner chooses . The industry had been determined to make major contractual inroads against soaring absenteeism in the mines , a phenomenon viewed by union officials as an expression of mistrust of the operators and dislike of working.conditions . Union Concessions The trade-offs won by the coal industry in exchange could still cause controversy but were not regarded as likely to bring another rejection . The major political difficulty in obtaining ratification seemed likely to stem from the companies ' apparent withdrawal of the bitterly contested " work force stability package , " the disciplinary provisions that would have allowed the operators to fine , to suspend without pay and ultimately to discharge the leaders or " fomenters " of wildcat strikes . The withdrawal was only apparent , or at least only partial , union officials said . In place of the earlier version 's stability package , the settlement today , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a plan handed down late last year by the three-member Arbitration Review Board . The plan from the board , which was created in the expired 1974 U.M.W. contract as an appeals court for arbitrators ' decisions in grievance cases , would permit the suspension and discharge of wildcat strike leaders under less conclusive evidence than was required under the withdrawn package . Court Appeal Likely The advantage to the union In this exchange was that " A.R.B. 108 , " as the board plan is known , can and almost certainly will be challenged by union lawyers in Federal court , if and when the operators call it into play . Similar language in the contract could not have been appealed to the courts . Another concession that the industry won was the return , in a new form , of an incentive pay provision , This would permit the companies to vary the standard wage rate by offering bonuses to men or crews who exceeded set coal-production norms . The union had objected to this idea as likely to encourage compromises with mine safety procedures . In the language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only with . the consent of . a majority of miners in each union local . The 160,000 strikers have refused to return to work under the 80-day TaftHartley restraining order that the Carter Administration obtained last Thursday from a Federal judge . Although the White House reported today with evident satisfaction that 151 coal mines , including 11 union mines , had resumed production under the court order , their total production of about 80,000 tons a day was not a very significant gain . Few large mines were expected to reopen under the Taft-Hartley order for more than intermittent ? production until the new contract is ratified . In fact , overt illegal interference with coal production by U.M.W. strikers was increasing today , according to wire service reports . The Justice Department now faces the difficult political choice of whether to seek prosecution of the ski-masked pickets and rock-throwing demonstrators who disrupted several operating mines today . It is feared that prosecution would alienate the miners who must now vote on the new agreement .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
