This honey bear is a fairly sim  --  ple and very cuddly teddy bear , and he is best made in a furry fab  --  ric . Besides the range of the natu  --  ral colors from white through fawn , beige , apricot , browns , and black , he is also charming in fanta  --  sy colors  --  pale blue , pink , or lav  --  ender . A most adaptable bear ! I made him in a soft , cream-colored fabric with a fairly long pile and tied a satin ribbon around his neck . If you follow the dimensions on the grid , he will be 14 inches high , but he also looks very nice in larger sizes . You might want to double the size of the grid squares you draw and make him 28 inches high . Or you can take these pages to a photostater and have the pat  --  terns increased to whatever size you wish . I gave my bear a felt nose but did not add a mouth . You might prefer him with a satin-stitch nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make him smile , the child 's reception will be the same . From You will need * Body fabric , 45 inches by 15 inches ( 114 cm by 38 cm ) * Felt for the nose , a scrap ( op  --  tional ) * Embroidery thread for the nose ( optional ) * 2 flat buttons for the eyes , 3/4 of an inch ( 19 mm ) in diameter * Ribbon for the neck , 30 inches ( 76 cm ) ( optional ) * Dacron polyester for stuffing , 8 ounces To draw the patterns , rule lines on wrapping paper across and down 11/2 inches apart to make 11/2-inch by 11/2-inch squares . Cutting Lay out the body fabric wrong side up . Place your patterns on it , following the directions of the ar  --  rows so the nap runs from the head to the tail . Cut 2 side front bodies , flipping the pattern over to reverse the second . Cut 2 side back bodies , reversing one . Cut 4 legs , reversing two . Cut 4 arms and 4 ears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but do not draw on the felt as it will be sewn on last . Instead , hold the pattern against the felt and cut around it . Mark the A 's , B 's , etc. , and mark the position of the eyes by pulling a knotted , contrasting colored thread through to the right side of the fabric . Sewing All seams should be 1/4 of an inch ( 6 mm ) . It is a good idea to sew the smaller pieces and put them aside before you assemble the bear . They do n't get lost and everything goes much faster at the end . Pin and sew the ears , placing two pieces together , right sides of the fabric facing , leaving the base open from H to G for turning . Clip the curves and turn right side out . Pin and sew the arms by placing two pieces together , right sides of the fabric facing , and sew around from E to F , leaving the top of the arms between E and F unsewn for turning . Clip the curves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the tops where they join the body , so they will be flexible . Step 1 . Sew the center back seam by putting the two side back pieces together , right sides of the fabrics facing . Pin , baste , and sew from A to I. Smith . Step 2 . Sew the center front seam by putting the two side front pieces together , right sides of the fabric facing . Pin , baste , and sew from A to C. When you go around his nose , take special pains to make the seam allowance exact as the shape of the nose is what gives the bear his appealing expression . Step 3 . Spread out the hack of the bear with the right side of the fab  --  ric up . Place the ears between H and G , with the base of the ears extended 1/8 of an inch ( 3 mm ) beyond the head , and baste be  --  tween G and H. Place the arms be  --  tween E and F in the same way . Point them in matching downward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 . Place the front of the bear against the back , right sides of the fabric facing , and pin , baste , and sew from D up the side through the base of the arms and the ears , over the head , matching the seams at A , and down the other side to D. If you have difficulty machine-sewing in the arms and the ears , you can hand-backstitch firmly . Clip the curves , with particular attention to the nose . Check the seams to see that they are all sewn securely and turn the bear right side out . Step 5 . Pin and sew two leg pieces together , right sides of the fabric facing . Sew around the leg from J to K , leaving an opening of around 21/2 inches ( 64 mm ) above the heel for stuffing . Leave the top be  --  tween J and K open . Clip the curves at the toe and turn right side out . Repeat with the other two leg pieces . Step 6 . To make the toes point forward , fold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the J 's and the K 's come together and are cen  --  tered on the leg . Baste across at the top to secure the seams in this position . Then pin , baste , and sew the tops of the legs to the front section of the bear from D through C to D on the right side of the fabric . Before you sew , be sure that the toes are pointing toward the body . Otherwise , the bear will have its legs pointing backwards . Step 7 . Stuff the legs , using less filling toward the tops where they join the body so they can move freely . Close the openings with a small overcast stitch . Stuff the body medium firm as the honey bear should be squeez  --  able , but stuff the head and neck firmly . When the bear is almost completely filled , start to close the opening . Turning the legs down automatically folds in the raw edge across the front , but on the back you must turn the raw edge in as you close the opening . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opening . Finishing Brush the seams gently to free any fur that may have been trap  --  ped . If you are using a felt nose , sew it on with a fine overcast stitch . Or embroider the nose with a satin stitch . If you prefer to give your bear a more realistic look , em  --  broider a mouth with a stem stitch . Sew on the button eyes . Then tie his bow . RAINBOW DOLLS I call these rainbow dolls be  --  cause I first did them in rainbow colors  --  blue , green , yellow , pink and lavender . But there are endless combinations of colors and corre  --  lated prints you may use . The skirt of one can match the hat of another , for example . It is n't necessary to make five snap-together dolls as I did . A single doll in an arabesque can snap her hands together . Two can dance hand in hand or you can make a circle of three . That 's why I 've given the fabric requirements for only one doll . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or mouths as I rather prefer them that way and I was thinking of Matisse 's dancers when I designed them . But of course you may add embroidered mouths and embroidered or but  --  ton eyes . Or you might want to use the same body pattern to make the dancing mice . The rainbow dolls are not par  --  ticularly hard to make as they are only 12 inches high . They just take care and accurate sewing . I think in some ways the turning and the stuffing are the fussiest part . Since they are done in smooth cotton , you have to turn them carefully , use very small pieces of stuffing , and work slow  --  ly so there wo n't be any lumps . You will need for one doll * Solid pastel cotton for hands , legs , and face ( 36 cm by 36 cm ) DANCING MICE The dancing mice are a whimsi  --  cal variation on the rainbow dolls .

Lay your patterns on the fabric following the directions of the ar  --  rows for the design or grain of the fabric . Cut 2 bodices , 2 skirts , 2 hats , and 2 pairs of underpants . Mark the single and double marks with tiny single and double snips or with a felt-tip pen . The only tricky part in putting this doll together is making sure not to get a hand or leg on back  --  ward , which is easy to do if you are working in a hurry . A fool  --  proof way to avoid this is to lay out all the pieces for both sides of the doll , wrong side of the fabric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top pieces together , hands to wrists , face to neck of bodice , and cap on head . Then pin legs and un  --  derpants together , but leave the waist unpinned since the top and the bottom sections are put to  --  gether last . For clarity 's sake , I 've drawn large notches on the illus  --  trations rather than the small snips or marks you will be using . Check to see that the two sides are mirror images of each other , that the thumbs of the hands are nearest the head , the upraised arm is toward the face , the upraised leg is toward the back , and that the caps point the right way . Sewing All seams should he 3/16 of an inch ( 5 mm ) . Step 1 . Pin and sew the four hand pieces to the wrists of the bodices , right sides of the fabrics facing . Then pin and sew the two face pieces to the bodices at the neck lines , matching the single marks , Continued on following page Dancing Mice only tricky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the necks are narrow . I chose to embroider the eyes shut with long lashes , but button eyes are equally nice . There is a lot of scope in dressing these dolls  --  aprons , bows , lace at throat and sleeves , tiny buttons on the dress . You can really let yourself go . You will need for the pair of dancing mice * Fabric for heads , hands , legs , and ears , 18 inches by 17 inches ( 46 cm by 43 cm ) * Pink felt for nose and ear lin  --  ings , 8 inches by 8 inches ( 21 cm by 21 cm ) * Printed cotton for bodices and girl mouse 's skirt and under  --  pants , 25 inches by 20 inches ( 64 cm by 51 cm ) * Solid-colored cotton for boy mouse 's underpants , 8 inches by 8 inches ( 21 cm by 21 cm ) * Embroidery thread , dark gray or brown , for eyes ( optional ) * 2 buttons , flat and 5/8 of an inch ( 16 mm ) in diameter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apron ( op  --  tional ) * Thin velvet or gros  --  grain ribbon for girl mouse ( optional ) * Medium snaps , 2 pairs * Dacron polyester for stuffing , approxi mately 12 ounces for both Follow the rainbow doll pattern for legs , underpants , bodice , and skirt , but use the dancing mice patterns for the heads , noses , hands , ears , and ear linings . The grid for these patterns should be drawn in 1-inch squares . If you are embroi  --  dering eyelashes , mark the curve on the head with a running stitch in a contrasting colored thread , pull  --  ing it through to the right side of the fab ? ric . If you are using button eyes , mark the eye dot by pulling through a knotted , contrasting colored thread . Sewing All seams should be 3/16 of an inch ( 5 mm ) . First , working on the wrong side of the fabric , sew the darts in the ears . Then line the ears , leav  --  ing the base of the ear open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . Sew the felt nose pieces to the head pieces from A to B , right sides of the fabrics facing . Step 1 . Cut the ear slits in the head pieces . Push the base of the ears through the ear slits from the right side of the fabric with the lining against the face so 1/8 of an inch ( 3 mm ) of the base shows from the wrong side . Make sure the lining of the ear faces toward the nose . Pinch the slit together and sew across firmly so both sides are caught in the seam . From here on follow the proce dures for the rainbow dolls . If you wish to give the girl mouse an apron , baste it to the skirt before sewing the skirt on . Finishing The eyes can be flat buttons or demurely shut with eyelashes em  --  broidered on . For embroidered eyelashes , stitch a half circle in stem stitch for the line of the eyelid , using three strands of embroidery thread . Then embroider the eye  --  lashes with a series of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back of the stem-stitch line . It is easier to make them even by doing the outer ones and the middle one first .

Pin and sew the two top halves of the body together , the right sides of the fab  --  rics facing , leaving the waist unsewn for turn  --  ing . Try to match the seams at the fore  --  heads , necks and wrists as carefully as possible . Clip the curves and the angles and cut across the tips of the thumbs and the peak of the hat close to the seams . Check the seams for any missing stitches . Turn right side out . Use a crochet hook or an orange stick at the peak of the hat and the tips of the thumbs so they are completely turn  --  ed . Step 4 .

He was trying his best to believe about the angel and the shep  --  herds , mainly because not believing made it so much harder for him . After the service Mr. Irving said he would come out with him to visit the shepherd , bringing some tobacco and a few other comforts . The boy was worried about this , knowing that the shepherd did not like visitors , particularly at this time of the year , be  --  cause of the condition of the sheep , some of whom were due to lamb . But the par  --  son insisted , and they went out together . It had been snowing during the morn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the dogs , Blindy and Tater , were outside , whimpering . " Poor fellows , " said the par  --  son . " They are cold in the snow . " But the boy knew that was not the reason , for the dogs were used to the cold . The door of the caravan was shut against the weather , and when the boy entered , he saw Rolfe sitting in his rocker near the stove . He seemed to have fallen asleep , and what he was dreaming about pleased him , for he was smiling . To the boy 's surprise the Gospel of Saint Luke lay open on his lap . The dogs came in after the boy and stood around the chair , look  --  ing up at the shepherd anxiously and whining . And then the boy knew that the shepherd was dead . The parson went gently to him and pick  --  ed the book out of the shepherd 's lap , glanced at the open page and showed it to the boy . It was opened at the ac  --  count @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And there were in the same country shep  --  herds abiding in the field , keeping watch over their flock by night .

" And the angel said unto them , ' Fear not , for , behold , I bring you good tidings of great joy , which shall be to all people . . " The boy read the pas  --  sage , fighting back his tears , and Mr. Irving , seeing this , said gently , " The angel of the Lord came to him , and all is well with him now . " From outside , above the whimper of the wind , the boy heard the baaing of a ewe and knew that her Iamb was due .

Clip the curves and the angles and cut across the tips of the toes close to the seams . Check for missing stitches and turn right side out . Use a crochet hook or an orange stick at the tips of the toes and on the heels so they are completely turned . Step 6 . Pin and sew the side seams of the skirt . Press seams and hem with a hand roll . Step 7 . Slip the skirt over the top half of the doll like a lampshade with the wrong side facing out . Pin the side seams of the skirt to the side seams of the doll at the waistline . Then pin , baste and sew the skirt to the top half of the doll around the waistline . Step 8 .

Sew the seam below the seam where the skirt is sewn to the bodice , and before you sew , check to see that the toes and the face are pointing in the same direction . Stuffing Since these dolls are made of smooth cotton and every lump will show , they should be stuffed carefully with very small pieces . The thumbs and the toes need special care , and the neck should be stuffed very firmly so the head wo n't sag . After stuffing , close the opening un  --  der the skirt with small overcast stitches . Finishing Sew snaps to the hands of the inside of the palm on one hand and the back of the hand on the other so one can clap hands , two can dance together , and more can form a circle .
