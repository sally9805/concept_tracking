I FIND that up here on top of a mountain , it is easier for me to get on top of the job , " remarked President Nixon as he enjoyed the splendid isolation of Camp David after winning reelection . His sojourn stretched on for 2 weeks , longer than that of any President who has used the retreat , so long that Comedian Alan King drew laughs in his Las Vegas routine by suggesting that the whole point of the election had been " to send a boy to camp . " Then , last week , the rumors rumbling down the mountainside turned into a sudden avalanche of appointments for Nixon 's second term . All were in keeping with the President 's notion that the best way to run an overgrown bureaucracy is to staff it with his own men-proven , competent , completely loyal . The careers of the four key appointees are described on following pages . <P> Most of the new men owe their eminence to Nixon , by and large ; they lack powerful constituencies to fall back on if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most important of the jobs goes to Boston Brahmin Elliot Richardson , who moved from HEW to Secretary of Defense , a post that will fully test his vaunted administrative skills . A combination of shrewdness and steadfastness under fire is expected to pull him through . He sees eye to eye with Henry Kissinger and is not likely to offer any rebuffs on foreign policy . While he lacks the clubby relations with Congress that his predecessor Melvin Laird enjoyed , he has more of an appetite for overall strategy and administrative detail . Balancing the relatively liberal Richardson at Defense-and no doubt adding to his troubles-will be a new Deputy Secretary , William P. Clements , an outspoken Texas oil millionaire who vociferously opposes defense cuts . <P> Moving into Richardson 's old job at HEW will be Caspar Weinberger , currently director of the Office of Management and Budget . Weinberger is less renowned for his social vision than for his budget-cutting proclivities . He is expected to hack away at the overgrown tangle of New Frontier and Great Society programs , many of which are not working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Money is n't the essential element in improving social conditions throughout the country . " A man of similar outlook succeeds Weinberger as budget chief . Roy Ash , president of embattled Litton Industries , is charged with applying the latest management methods to Government spending-which means , essentially , spending less . Says a White House staffer : " Ash is going to take a look at the legislation , what its intent was and how it 's working . This is going to be a detailed review of all Government spending . " <P> Shifts at the State Department are intended to make it more of a Nixon enterprise . At the same time , officials are hopeful that the new appointments will regain for the State some of the luster it has lost in the Kissinger era . Perhaps out of respect for the gentlemanly way in which he has accepted Henry Kissinger 's starring role in foreign policy , William Rogers will stay on as Secretary . But the three key posts just beneath him have been swept clean :       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
