txt AMES , Ia. ? The first time Prince Mohammed Al Faisal thought about ice was hist after he dinned and fall an it He was 10 years old at the time , bedecked in robes , and did n't know what it was . He was on a plane that landed in Greenland one dark , cold night in 1997 while he was traveling with his father , the king of Saudis Arabia . That was the first time . The second time Prince Faisal paid any mind to ice ? as opposed to water ? was four years ago , when he was out in his country 's vast desert . He had just read an article and was deep in thought . If they could lasso an Iceberg and tow it to Chile in the 19th Century , as in the article he 'd read , why not do it in the 20th ? WHY NOT bring icebergs to the Saudia Arabian desert ? And why not make a business out of it ? selling icebergs to water-poor countries ? " So I thought about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the chair In his cement-walled temporary office at Iowa State University . " You know , water to my country is essential . We are always thinking about It . One-third of the world is desert , Another third is water-short . So two-thirds of the world is always thinking about water . And the water is at the South Pole , pure , sweet , water , 90 per cent of the pure water of the world , all floating in icebergs . " " So why not harness them and bring them to us ? " So why not ? PRINCE FAISAL has the money , piles of money from the oil-rich bowels of his country . And he worked for 15 years with the Saline Water Conversion Corp . in Saudia Arabia in an attempt to provide water by removing the salt from seawater . But it was very expensive . What Is needed , he said , " is a revolutionary way to get water . Revolutionary , but logical . " I started talking to people about bringing icebergs up from the South Pole to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done , and some said it could n't . " I talked to a Frenchman who headed a polar expedition . He said he had been thinking of the very same thing . He said he did not know if it was feasible , but ho said he would look into it . " SOME TIME later , lie came back and gave me the report ; it was Positive . So I jumped into the thing . " What he jumped into and then started was the Iceberg Transport International Co. , a business organization with the prince as the sole backer . And what he hopes to do is to grab onto the behemoth chunks of ice that break oft the polar ice cap at the South Pole and bring them north , aided by the winds and the currents of the typhoon season , to sell to countries and people that need pure , salt-free , sweet water . " It is my idea , but it was many people 's idea , " said the prince , who is sponsoring a four-day conference at ISU on iceberg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been the major backer , but most everything that has been said my company already knows . " THERE IS no government behind me . I am the sole backer . My country and the world need water now . We have done a lot of work already . " If you would leave this to academia , they would only talk about it . If you left // Close-up With Anne Keegan Water in odd lots  --  a princely plan , but will it be able to float ? // it to government , they would take 20 years to make a decision on It . So I decided the only way to do it was as a businessman and get it done . " You ask who owns icebergs , " he sold . " Right now , nobody . If you can capture an iceberg , you are the owner . Icebergs are legally flotsam , floating free in the sea . " But you see there is a need  --  a crucial need  --  all over the world for water . There is even a water shortage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . No one country has yet said to me , ' Order us an iceberg , ' but they will . " 1 PLAN on the first Iceberg to come up in IMO . I have already seen many icebergs just the right size . The pilot iceberg will be 100 million tons and about a mile long . After that , the standard iceberg will be 1 billion tons and four or five miles long . As you can see , it is no small thing . " And in bringing the icebergs north , they will not melt ? oh , no . That Is the Close-up wonderful thing about icebergs . They tend to collect water . They gather clouds around them , they are so big . And when you deliver the iceberg you shall have more water than when you started off at the South Pole . THE PRINCE said be has not decided how to propel the icebergs . " There are many theories , " he said , " and using a tugboat is a very primitive one . " lie is co-author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving icebergs by putting giant paddlewheels on them . " A good idea , but I have made no decision . " " Every year , " said the prince , " tens of thousands of icebergs break off and float to sea . Think of what they could do . Think of the food we can develop and the industries that can grow and the human activities that will foster . " THINK . ALSO , of all the money the prince will make selling icebergs , " I am already rolling in dough , " said the prince . " I am not thinking it will bring me money , I em thinking it will bring me a glass of pure sweet water in Sandia Arabia . " Look , " he said . " I was a dreamer when I started the desalinization plant in my country . I was dreamer then , but it worked . No , I am a realist  --  with icebergs I am a realist , It will cost only $80 to $100 million for my investment , That 's not so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , but there 's not enough water . " We will see , " he said , turning and smiling to one of his aides . " When I first talked to people four years ago about ' icebergs , they laughed . They 'd put on a big smile and chuckle whenever I mentioned it . But now we have this conference here , with scientists from all over the world , and nobody is laughing now . "
