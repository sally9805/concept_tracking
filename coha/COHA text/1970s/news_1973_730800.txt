txt Letters to the Editor The June 4 Primary  --  or How to Stimulate Apathy To the Editor : The recent primary election may have " narrowed the field " for the Democratic nomination for Mayor , but it did nothing to clarify the situation for voters in the November election . For after a four-man primary and a two-man runoff , only one Democrat will actually be eliminated from the November ballot , and he will be replaced by the Republican candidate . Voters will again be asked to choose between four men , and with no runoff provision a candidate could theeretically be elected Mayor with %IV 20 per cent of the vote . if Mr , Hearne wins the runoff , cons servative votes will be divided three ways between Mr , Beam Mr , Marcht and Mr : Biaggi ? The probable result will he the election of Mr , Blumenthal on the Liberal line , with around one . third of the vote : If Mr : Boding wino the Iota , he and Mr : ** will Wit the lib -- eral vote ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote ..

If we had , by tariffs and quotas , limited the import of two items ? small cars and consumer electronics ? as major industrial countries have excluded our agricultural products , there never even would have been discussion of supposed overvaluation of our currency . Increased imports of automobiles and consumer electronics accounted for substantially all the deterioration of our foreign trade between 1965 and 1971 , when we began to devalue the dollar . Had our food products , the most important category of expenditure in all countries , been allowed to enter Japan and the Common Market as freely as cars enter the U.S. , the yen , mark and franc would have seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6 , 1973 ? Of Solzhenitsyn Royalties And American Publishers To the Editor : Hedrick Smith 's May 15 news article about my forthcoming book " Ten Years After ' One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovicle " was followed by a report of American publishers ' " exceptions " to my account of the unauthorized publication of Solzhenitsyn works and the futile efforts by Solzhenitsyn representatives to gain use of American royalties . The publishers ' reply , curiously prompt in view of the fact that they had not yet seen my book , calls for a rebuttal : As far as Fawcett Publications is concerned , I criticized the publisher 's statement  --  plain to see for everyone who owns a copy of the Fawcett edition of " One Day " ? that , if Solzhenitsyn fails to come to the United States to collect his royalties within ten years , the royalties will be used for " a worthy anti-Communist purpose . " The ten years have passed and Solzhenitsyn did not go to the United States . My questions are : Did Fawcett do what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea ? Concerning Praeger , I commented on a statement Praeger 's president , Mr. Adler , made in The Times of London on Nov. 20 , 1969 , namely , that the royalties for " One Day " had been sent to a group that organizes escapes from Eastern Europe . Literaturnaya Gazeta dealt with that statement in a Nov. 26 , 1969 , attack on Solzhenistyn . I. did not discuss Harper &; Row . As to the other publishers , who now say that they " believed " they had contracts with real representatives of Solzhenitsyn , I must say that it would have been useful if they had had something more reliable than " belief . " The Russian edition of my book has already been published and is available , and my discussion of the subject can be checked directly from the book , where all necessary documents about my correspondence are given .

After all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the true political sentiments of New York City voters . The manner in which this election is developing does more to stimulate apathy and unconcern than civic pride and political involvement . Its inevitable inconclusiveness makes one wonder whether the effort is really worth it . MILTON SCHULMAN Astoria , N. Y. , June 6 , 1973 ? To the Editor : It may seem incredible that in New York City in 1973 a native-born American registered to vote is unable to do so . This has happened to me ; not once but twice . In August I moved to a new address . I registered , but when I went to vote in the Presidential election it seemed there was no record that I had registered . Before the school board election , I again registered . I received a voting card at that time and received In the Wake of Teapot Dome : How the G.O.P. Prevailed To the Editor : Robert E. Lawther , in his recent letter recounting the Republicans ' ability to ride out scandals and triumph at the polls in the next election , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that made possible Republican success after the Teapot Dome imbroglio . Albert B. Fall , Secretary of the Interior in the Harding Cabinet , did serve a prison sentence following his conviction for accepting a bribe from the head of an oil company which obtained a lease on Government-owned oil lands . Harry M. Daugherty , Harding 's Attorney General , was not convicted . Vice President Coolidge succeeded to the Presidency at Harding 's death and tried at fist to ride out the storm . After the House of Representatives passed a resolution demanding an investigation , President Coolidge appointed his Amherst classmate , Dean Harlan Fiske Stone of the Columbia Law School , a highly respected lawyer and professor of law , to conduct the investigation . Stone did a thorough job , which cleared the air and almost certainly made possible Republican victory in the 1924 election . Harding 's Secretary of Commerce , Herbert Hoover , and his Secretary of State , Charles Evans Hughes , were in no way tainted by Teapot Dome , and no responsible observer ever said they were . Does Mr , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cabinet table ? For that matter , the unfortunate Harding was never directly connected with it either , and there was never any evidence adduced to show that he was aware of it before it happened . JULIAN HESS New York , June 6 , 1973 To the Editor : Readers of The Times should be aware of proposed legislation that would establish a legally constituted censorship mechanism with the agencies , departments and public corporations and other entities of the executive branch of the Commonwealth government of Puerto Rico . The proposed law , Commonwealth Senate Bill No. 494 , is now on the desk of Gov . Rafael Hernandez-COlon of Puerto Rico . He has until June 16 to sign or to disapprove the measure , which has been misnamed " The Freedom of Information Act . " There have been vigorous and unanimous objections by representatives of the press , news media officials ( including El Mundo , El Imparcial , The San Juan Star and El Nuevo Dia  --  the four leading daily newspapers published in Puerto Rico ) , representatives of the electronic media , individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Freedom of the Press Committee of the InterAmerican Press Society and the Overseas Press Club of Puerto Rico . Appointed aides of Governor Hernandez-Dion strongly support the measure because they say it will insure the flow of information to the citizenry from governmental entities . The Governor has stated publicly that he has n't made a decision yet . All the critics of the bill fear that certain sections of the measure clearly empower any instrumentality of the Commonwealth government to keep secret any material " exempt from revelation by executive order . " This broadens unconscionably the already hotly debated stricture of the existing Federal information law , which apparently gives the executive power another in the mail . When I went to vote in the school board election , again ' there was no record . I asked to go through the papers and managed to find my name very clearly printed . I voted . When I went to vote in the June 4 primary , there was no record . When I raised my voice to ask if it were not my right to vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was told by the policeman not to disturb others . Mrs. Abzug 's office told me to sign an affidavit and vote . The polling place had no such form . My only alternative was to go downtown to court . This should not be necessary since this is the third election in which I should have voted in this district . I would hate to suggest that there is some sort oe racial bias in all this , but the idea seems very real . I do not hide my beliefs . I wanted very much to vote for Herman Badillo . It is about time all people had a chance to be heard in city government . How can New Yorkers ever know the true desires of voters if the system systematically denies citizens to exercise their right ? The country has a long , long way to go before our honored tradition of liberty and justice for all has any kind of real meaning . MARY ELIZABETH PETTIT New York , June 4 , 1973 ? To the Editor : The newspapers reported on election day that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not registered in the party they sought to vote in . Thus far , under our party systems only those who registered in and considered themselves to be members of a certain party could vote in that party 's primary contest , Unless this is settled before June 26 , it opens up an opportunity for ballot-stuffing by nonparty members and perhaps even by noncitizens . Only chaos can result from that judge 's decision  --  or was it several judges " ? J.B. MILGRAM Brooklyn , June 6 , 1973 ? To the Editor : The possible failure of Judge Weinstein to receive the Democratic nomination for chief judge is only the latest indication that election is no way to get good judges . Earlier , on Primary Day , any conscientious , fairly well - informed citizen got another dose of the same medicine upon entering the voting booth and being required to vote for various delegates to a judicial nominating cOrivention , about whom absolutely nothing was known . Indeed , the names seem to have been chosen for their ethnic appeal . There were two alternatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any . This is no better than having candidates selected and appointed by the worst political hacks . ELLEN M. POLER New York , June 6 , 1973 to withhold information by Executive order for reasons of national security . Furthermore , the Commonwealth bill would establish an information " official " in each agency and department who would determine if requested information should be revealed . Third parties involved ( named in govern . ment papers ) would be given an opportunity to protest divulgation . The Commonwealth bill would establish a cumbersome bureaucracy intended to guarantee the flow of information to the citizenry ; however , such an apparatus would inevitably impede the flow of information to citizens and especially to the press . Another point against the bill is that it was passed by both the Senate and House of the Commonwealth Legislature without fanfare and without requisite , broad public hearings . News media representatives and the general public only learned of the measure after legislative passage . There was no opportunity for the general public ? nor for vitally concerned members of the press  --  to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prior to approval . Clearly , this bill should be vetoed and the matter sent back to the Legislature for wide discussion and hearings at the next regular session . MAGGIE BOBS President Overseas Press Club of Puerto Rico Santurce , P. R. , June 1 , 1973 ON GOOD FRIDAY Old Milton walked his blackened land alone , ' Except for one sure Light that warmed his soul , And in his desolation found the whole Long labor of his dying and the moan Of weakened flesh , and lonely , given grace , Not by loud trumpets and the kiss of kings , But by a stillness which to vast souls brings A cosmic union in a little place . So let us kneel within a darkened wprld , A sad , fragmented country , lost in mist , And hold our two souls , yearning union , up To Vastness , still and tender , all unfurled To seeking ones , and quiet , who have hissed The crucifix and in a small place drained His cup .
