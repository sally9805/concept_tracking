man and a woman in the front seat . The car stopped behind my rented Buick . The woman got out . Mrs. Ackroyd heaved a sigh of relief . " It 's Vera . " The car drove away . Vera Harrington came slowly up the walk . She appeared to be utterly exhausted . When she reached the door I stepped aside . She took no notice of me . Her face was milk white . " Are you all right ? " her mother asked anxiously . " I 'd like to lie down , " Vera said in a small voice . " Mrs. Harrington , " I said . She gave me a blank look . And suddenly she swayed . I caught her . She did n't quite lose consciousness , but she went limp in my arms . I scooped her up and carried her to the couch . " Get some brandy , " I said to Mrs. Ackroyd . Mrs. Ackroyd hurried from the room . I began to rub Vera 's hands . They were like ice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made do with it . Color began to return to Vera 's face . She tried to sit up . " Do n't , " I said . " Urn , " she said , and closed her eyes . But presently she opened them . " Thank you , " she said in a voice that was stronger . " I 'll call the doctor , " Mrs. Ackroyd said . " No , " said Vera . " I 'm all right . It 's just that those awful men ... " She did n't finish . She looked at me . " Who are you ? " I gave her my name . It did n't seem to mean anything to her . " Some nice hot tea , " Mrs. Ackroyd suggested . Vera nodded . Mrs. Ackroyd went back to the kitchen . I offered Vera more bourbon , but she said no . She made an effort to sit up and found that she could . The terrible pallor was gone . She resembled her mother , I thought , except that her hair was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was n't as pronounced . A pretty woman , really. 40 " I 'm sorry , " she said . " I do n't know what came over me . I have n't been able to sleep , and those awful policemen . The way they talked , you 'd think Wes was a criminal or something . " I made a sympathetic sound . And meant it . The shock of the murder , the funeral arrangements , the interrogation  --  she 'd been through a lot in the past day and a half . " You 'll feel better after you 've had some tea , " I said . " Can you stand ? " " I think so . " She tried it . " Yes . " We went into the kitchen . The kettle started to whistle . We sat down at a Formica-topped table . Mrs. Ackroyd brought tea for all of us , then sat down herself . I looked around the room . It was like what I 'd seen of the rest of the house : neat , pastelish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forty-five thousand . It appeared to have been built at the same time as all the other houses on the street by a developer who had one basic design which he varied slightly here and there . Vera sipped her tea . She eyed me over the rim of the cup . " Are you a friend of Wes 's ? " " No , " I said . " We had a business appointment . I could n't understand why he did n't keep it . Then I read in the newspaper ... " Her hand began to tremble . Some tea spilled . She put the cup down . " It was ghastly . " Her mother patted Vera 's arm . " Try not to think about it . " " I ca n't help it , " Vera said . " It keeps going through my mind . " I 'd read all the available news stories before coming to the house . Wesley Harrington had gone out on Sunday evening . He 'd come home shortly after eleven . His wife had gone to bed . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being opened . Then she 'd heard a car being driven away at high speed . She 'd waited for her husband to come into the house . He had n't come . She 'd got out of bed to investigate . The garage was attached to the house . She 'd opened the door that led to the garage from the kitchen . Harrington was on the garage floor . He 'd been shot four times and was dead. 41I glanced toward the door which I guessed was the one Vera had opened . It was now closed . " Simply ghastly , " she said . " You must try not to think about it , " Mrs. Ackroyd told her . Then she said to me , " Vera 's a college graduate . " I gave her a startled look . So did Vera . " Well , she is , " Mrs. Ackroyd insisted . " She won a four-year scholarship to Syracuse . " She sounded aggrieved . As if Vera 's education had somehow been betrayed . " Mother ! " Vera protested . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she still thought it very unfair for the husband of a college graduate to be murdered . " According to the papers , " I said , " your husband had been to see a friend . Someone named Malcolm Davis , who also worked for Interlake . " Vera nodded . " You know him ? " I shook my head . " You 're not missing anything . " I drank some tea . Vera made another attempt to drink some herself . Her hand was none too steady , but she managed to get the cup to her lips . " This is good , " she said . She put the cup down . " He was a bad influence on Wes . " " Davis ? " " He 's a lush . " " You know I do n't like that term , dear , " Mrs. Ackroyd said . " A lush , " Vera repeated . " Wes never had a drinking problem until he began going around with Malcolm . I mean , he drank , but he never used to stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to be home on time he 'd call me , and he never used to say he was going to work late when he was n't . I blame it all on Malcolm . " " Is that why you did n't go with your husband Sunday night ? " Vera thought for a moment . " Have you ever wished you could unsay things ? " 42 " Very often . " " Well , that 's the way I feel about Sunday night . I wish with all my heart I could unsay the things I said to Wes before he went out . I was angry . We 'd been having a nice day , and then right in the middle of dinner Malcolm calls . He wants Wes to come over . I mean , it 's not enough that they go out together during the week , and Wes does n't come home until all hours , and he 's had so much to drink that it 's all I can do to get him up the next morning  --  now it 's supposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . I told Wes he could n't go . We 're together little enough , I said . Well , he said he had to go , and one word led to another , and we ended up having a fight , and I said some pretty awful things , and now I feel just dreadful , because those are the last things I ever said to Wes . I did n't really mean them but I said them , and he died before I had a chance to say I did n't mean them . Now it 's too late . " Her chin began to quiver . " I do n't think you ought to be telling this gentleman all that , " Mrs. Ackroyd said . Vera bit her lip . Her chin stopped quivering . " Have you got a cigarette ? " she asked . I gave her one and lit it for her . " And it was n't all Malcolm 's fault either , " she went on . " I mean , his wife 's left him and taken the children with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs a friend . I can see that . I do n't like him and I think he was a bad influence on Wes , but I can understand . " She inhaled smoke deeply , the way someone in great pain might inhale an anesthetic . " You must try not to think about it , " Mrs. Ackroyd said , " or you 'll make yourself sick . " Vera transferred the cigarette to her other hand and drank some tea . " Do I sound like a shrew ? " she asked me . " No , " I said . " Well , I feel like one . I really do . " She paused . " Mother 's right , I suppose . I should n't be telling you all this . I do n't even know who you are . " 43 " I 'm a securities analyst . Your husband never mentioned me ? " " Not that I recall . " " He did n't telephone me ? Friday night or Saturday morning ? " " He was out Friday night . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " The nursery ? " " Tree nursery . Our little crab apple got blown over , the last storm we had . Wes bought another . " " Say between ten o'clock and noon ? " " He was at the nursery . " " He was going to show me a list of some securities . Would you know anything about that ? " Vera shook her head . " What about Sunday ? " I asked . " Sunday morning , that is . Did he make any telephone calls then ? " " I could n't say . I was at church . Wes never went , but I do . What kind of securities ? " " Some securities that belong to Interlake . " " Wes never brought problems home from the office . That 's one thing I 'll say for him . " " We 're Episcopalians , " Mrs. Ackroyd said . " Vera was always very good about going to church . " I looked at her . I got the impression that she had n't had an easy life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live here ? " " Goodness , no . I 'm from Utica . I just came yesterday . Vera called me in the middle of the night , to tell me . I took the first plane . I had to change in Buffalo . " I turned back to Vera . " Your husband liked his work ? " A note of annoyance came into her voice . " You sound like one of those awful policemen . Was Wes having trouble at the office ? Are we in debt ? Did he gamble ? Who are his enemies ? Like  --  like  --  Wes did n't have enemies . He was n't that kind of a man . He was happy in his work . As happy as anyone is , maybe more so . He did n't gamble . We are n't in debt . He did drink , yes , but he was n't what you 'd call an alcoholic . " 44 " I 'm sorry , " I said . " I did n't mean it the way it sounded . But I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The shooting was done so fast , so efficiently , and there were no clues . They evidently figure it was a professional job . And , according to what I read , there was no sign of robbery . " Vera sighed . " I know . I can understand too , I guess . But that does n't make it any easier . Anyway , Wes was doing all right at work . Mr. Rasher liked him . " The name Rasher was familiar to me , from Best 's . Richard Rasher . Treasurer of Interlake . " He was your husband 's boss ? " " Yes . " " And he 's been just wonderful , " Mrs. Ackroyd put in . " He came to the house last night and he 's helping with the funeral arrangementsand  --  " " If you had a date with Wes , " Vera interrupted , " Mr. Rasher 's the one you 'll probably have to see . He wo n't be at the office tomorrow morning  --  he 's coming to the funeral  --  but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll call him , " I said . " I 'd also like to meet this Malcolm Davis , I think . Do you happen to have his address ? " Vera regarded me thoughtfully . " More than likely he 'll be at the office tomorrow afternoon also . " She paused . " A securities analyst , did you say ? " " Price , Potter and Petacque , " I told her . " Our office is in New York . I 'd like to catch as early a plane as possible . If I could see Davis this evening , it would save time . " The thoughtful gaze continued . " We 're rather a well-known brokerage house , " I said . " Interlakehas done business with us . " In a sense it was true . I 'd interviewedInterlake executives and mentioned the company in my reports . " Well , " Vera said slowly . Then she stubbed out her cigarette , got up from the table and left the room . She still did n't appear to have regained all her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She45read me Davis 's address and telephone number . I wrote it down . After a moment she said , " The list Wes was going to show you  --  what would it look like ? " " I do n't know , " I said . " Stocks and bonds . Maybe treasury notes . Mostly bonds , though . " Good quality bonds , too , no doubt . " I 'm almost positive it 's not here . Wes hardly ever brought work home from the office . I 'll look around , though . Where are you staying ? " " At the Astor Tower . " " Finish your tea , " Mrs. Ackroyd told her daughter . " It 's getting cold . Then I think you ought to lie down . " Vera obediently picked up her cup . Her hand was all right now . So was her color . But there were dark shadows under her eyes . I was suddenly reminded of my mother . She 'd looked like that once . The same shadows , the same haunted expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take up any more of your time . Thank you for talking to me . If there 's anything I can do ... " Vera put her cup down . " Thank you , " she said . " I 'm sorry I was such a nuisance . " Both women walked me to the door . We said good-bye . Vera and I shook hands . She let her hand linger in mine for a moment . I left . She closed the door . I started down the walk to the street . When I reached my car I paused and looked back at the house . It did n't appear to be any different from the other houses on the block . Yet it was different . A man had been shot to death in it . My eyes traveled to the garage door . It was shut . I imagined it open . I imagined a car standing in the driveway with its headlightson . I imagined a body on the concrete floor , illuminated by the beam of the headlights . I shuddered. 469Sheridan Road . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old mansions , gone to pot , diminished by the string of new high-rise apartment buildings on the other side of the street . The Lakeside . Thirty-odd stories of concrete and glass behind a semicircular driveway , an angular arrangement of steel pipes spouting water into a small basin and a sign saying : " THE LAKESIDE . LUXURY LIVING . ONE , TWO AND THREE BEDROOM CONDOMINIUMS , FROM $39,500 . MODELS OPEN DAILY . " I found the garage , which was down a ramp on the side of the building , and turned my car over to an attendant who did n't really want to take it . I opened a door that said : " TO LOBBY " and climbed some steps . The doorman , who was maybe eighteen years old , was engaged in conversation with a young lady who was maybe sixteen years old . I studied a panel of buttons with names and numbers next to them . Davis , M. , was in 23F . I picked up the telephone next to the panel and stood there , trying to decide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one hand and a set of keys in the other made it unnecessary for me to say anything . She unlocked the door that led to the inner lobby and held it open for me . I thanked her , and we rode up in the elevator together . She asked me whether I knew when the laundry room would be completed . I said I was n't sure . The corridor smelled of paint . F was opposite the elevators and47a little to the left . I hesitated before pushing the buzzer . It was possible that he would n't be home . It was possible that he would be home but would n't let me in . It was possible that he 'd let me in but would n't tell me anything . I pushed the buzzer . I could hear it ring on the other side of the door . I listened for footsteps . There were none . But suddenly the door was flung open and I found myself facing a big man with a red face and a scowl . He was barefoot and naked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said . " Where 's the pizza ? " he demanded . " I 'm Brockton Potter , " I said . His scowl deepened . Then he slammed the door in my face . The suddenness of the action left me astonished . As did the sound of his voice . For the anonymous telephone calls had n't come from Wesley Harrington ; they 'd come from Malcolm Davis. 4810It was eight-thirty when I got back to the hotel . I called Irving . He was at home . I told him that I was staying in Chicago an extra day and asked him what was new at the office . He 'd got the letter out , he reported . He 'd also heard from Harriet ; she was already in San Francisco . And Jaime had talked to George Cole 's friend at Billings-Smithson . Jaime wanted to go to Cleveland to get more information . Irving had told him to go ahead . Jaime was planning to leave the following morning and would be back on Thursday . " Have you found out anything about Computech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much time , " he replied . " Tom talked to me this afternoon . Amalgamated is definitely going to buy some . And I spent a few minutes on Computech 's last financial statement . They 've made some changes in their accounting procedures . Is that what you wanted to know ? " " Not exactly . " I 'd read the statement myself at the time it was published . I did n't remember the details , however . " But what changes did they make ? " " Accelerated write-offs . And the money from the sale of the Martin Pump division went into profits . Nothing illegal , but you have to read the fine print to catch it . " " Well , keep checking . See what else you can come up with . " " Will do . But what 's this all about , Brock ? If it 's any of my business . " 49 " I heard a strange story about Interlake . I 'm trying to get to the bottom of it . Anything that affects Interlake could affect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Maybe you 'd better postpone your Detroit trip to next week . " " I did that yesterday . " " Good boy . " I hung up . Notices with a Toulouse-Lautrec look were planted here and there , stating that Maxim 's was in the hotel . I decided to find it . I found it in the basement , at the foot of a curved , red-carpeted stairway . " Do you have a reservation ? " the maitre d ' asked . The room was half empty . " No , " I said . He thought about it for a while , then grudgingly seated me . I ordered chicken with a fancy name and an endive salad and settled back to contemplate the rose in the silver vase in front of me . Presently a small orchestra began to play . One elderly couple got up to dance . They were joined by another elderly couple . One of the elderly men was wearing a green velvet jacket over a white turtleneck . Not Wesley Harrington , I thought ; Malcolm Davis . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Malcolm Davis . The door had been open for ten seconds at the most . Yet there were things to recall . About the man himself and even about the room he was standing in . A large room , carpeted from wall to wall but with scarcely any furniture in it . Davis had evidently just moved in or was just getting ready to move out . Maybe both . A powerful-looking guy . At least six feet two , with shoulders like railroad ties . Red-faced from alcohol or from anger . A tendency  --  judging by the way he 'd thrown the door open  --  toward violence . Broad cheeks , heavy black eyebrows , the beginning of a double chin . All in all , a man who 'd once been tough and attrac-50tive , was still reasonably so , but would n't be so for much longer if he kept on the way he was going . Not at all like Harry Wickoff . Except perhaps for the anger . And even that was different . Wickoff 's was cold and internal . Davis 's was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently been deserted by his wife . The waiter brought the salad . And applied pepper to it from a grinder the size of a bowling pin . I turned on the television set . A movie was beginning . The credits were being shown . Between the credits were shots of various people getting on an airplane . All of them appeared tense and nervous . You got the feeling that something was going to go wrong as soon as the plane was in the air . The director 's name appeared on the screen , and the plane took off . My telephone rang . It was Vera Harrington . She was in the lobby . She wanted to come up . " Sure , " I said . I was taken aback when I saw her . She looked different . She 'd done something with her hair and she was all in black . " I 'm sorry to disturb you so late , " she said . " I tried to call you earlier , but you were out . " She seemed more composed than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not disturbing me . " She came into the suite . She 'd been at the funeral home , she explained . Visitation . And when the visitation was over she 'd driven her mother back to Chicago Heights . I 'd salvaged the bottle of Scotch from the night before . I offered her some . " Just a little , " she said . I poured drinks for both of us . " Thank you , " she said as I handed her one of the glasses . " I51really did n't want any visitation , but Mother insisted , and I 'm glad she did . It helps to have people around . And things do n't seem so ... abnormal . " She paused . " Did you see Malcolm ? " " Very briefly . " She did n't pursue the subject . " What I wanted to tell you is I found a list . It may be the one you asked about . " My heart skipped a beat . " You did ? " She opened her pocketbook and took out an envelope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single sheet of memo paper . " From the desk of Wesley Harrington " was printed across the top . Beneath that were two columns of neat handwriting . The first line of the first column said : " Nev NG 81/2 89 19472-610 . " I understood immediately . Nevada Natural Gas bonds which yielded 81/2 percent interest and were due to mature in 1989 , with serial numbers 19472 through 19610 . Each bond was worth in the neighborhood of a thousand dollars . A hundred and thirty-nine thousand dollars in all . The second entry was for a hundred and ninety-six thousand dollars ' worth of Northeast Telephone bonds with a maturity date of 1991 . " Is this your husband 's handwriting ? " I asked . Vera nodded . " Where did you find it ? " " In the humidor . " " The humidor ? " " A cigar humidor . Someone gave it to Wes one Christmas . Wes did n't smoke cigars , but the humidor was so pretty he kept it . He used it for papers , like until he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or sometimes receipts that he wanted to save . Things of that sort . " I scanned the columns . About half of the entries referred to the bonds of public utility companies , the rest to municipals . I did n't make an exact count of the sum involved , but twenty-three millionseemed quite possible. 52 " Is that the list you were talking about ? " Vera asked . " I believe so . " " What does it mean ? " " It 's a list of bonds . May I borrow it ? " " I do n't know , " she said dubiously . " I do n't know what Wes would want me to do . " " He 'd want you to let me have it . " " I do n't know . Maybe I ought to show it to Mr. Rasher . " " That 's up to you . It 's possible that Mr. Rasher 's already seen it . All I need it for is a few hours . I 'll mail it back to you tomor-row . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk to Mr. Rasher , I have to know what I 'm talking about . " She hesitated a moment longer , then said , " All right . But you will mail it back to me , wo n't you ? " " I promise . " I put the list in my pocket before she could change her mind . She sipped her drink and frowned . " Was Wes in any sort of trouble ? " " I do n't know , Vera . I do n't know anything about him . " Her frown lingered . " I was married to him for thirteen years but I 'm beginning to think I did n't know anything about him either . " She put her glass on the table . " I used to think I knew him better than anybody in the world , but what it was , I think , is I was taking him for granted . Taking people for granted is n't the same as really knowing them . Has that ever happened to you  --  you took someone for granted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you did n't ? It 's kind of sad , actually . It happens mostly between husbands and wives , I think . Are you married ? " " No . " " It starts out nice but sometimes it changes . In fact , I guess it always changes . Maybe it would have been different if we 'd had children . " I said nothing. 53 " I do n't know , though . These past few months , with the drinkingand everything . . . " She picked up her glass , studied it , then drank some Scotch . " I 'm not sure I was being fair when I blamed everything on Malcolm . Maybe some of it was something else . " " In other words , the past few months were n't so good . " " Wes was changing . It was n't just his drinking . He was more irritable . He would n't tell me what it was . Every time I tried to find out he told me everything was fine . But something was botheringhim . I 'm sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was in trouble . " She paused . " Do you think he knew someone wanted to kill him ? " " Did he ever say anything like that ? " " No . But something was on his mind . And someone did kill him . " She finished the drink and put the glass down . She glanced at my pocket as if she still was n't sure that giving me the list had been the right thing to do . She did n't ask me to give it back , however . " Do you know Mr. Jars ? " " Jars ? " " Jars or Yars . I 'm not sure which . His first name is Clifford . " " No . Should IT ' " I do n't know . I thought you might . " " Who is he ? " " That 's what I 'd like to find out . Wes mentioned the name a couple of times when he was drunk . " I searched my memory . The name meant nothing to me . " In what connection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' he said one time . He sounded upset . What JarsT I asked . Clifford Jars , ' he said . Who 's heT I asked . Nobody , ' he said . Leave me alone . ' Then the next time he said , If it were n't for Jars ! ' and we went through the same thing . It could be Yars , though . I 'm really not sure . When I tried to question Wes he got angry . " " Never heard of anybody with that name , " I said . " Well , " she said , " I do n't suppose it matters . I 'd better be going. 54It 's a long ride , and Mother 'll be worried . " She got up . I got up too . But then she did n't move toward the door . She just stood there , looking indecisive and unhappy . " I hate to go home , " she said . " I 'm going to miss him . In spite of everything , I 'm going to miss him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comforting . I took her hand . " Time has a way , " I said . It was the best I could do . " I suppose . " She let me hold her hand for a moment , then withdrew it and hurried from the suite . I thought about her for a while . I poured myself another drink . I took the list from my pocket . It contained some of the safest securities in the entire world . No insurance company would limit its portfolio to the bonds of public utility companies or the most solvent municipal governments . But if someone wanted to steal from the portfolio of an insurance company , those were the items he 'd take . For they were negotiable everywhere. 55 " Mr. Rasher is in conference , " the secretary said . " Will you ask him to call me , please , as soon as he can ? " " Your name ? " " Brockton Potter . I 'm at the Astor Tower , 12A . " " And what was it you wished to talk to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Could you be more specific ? " " I 'm afraid not . Just tell him Brockton Potter , of Price , Potter and Petacque . " " I 'll tell him . But  --  " " Thank you . " I hung up . The conference ended in a hurry . Five minutes later my tele- phone rang . " Mr. Potter ? " the same secretary said . " Mr. Rasher would like to speak with you . " Rasher came on the line . Although we 'd never met , he made it sound as if we had . " Brockton Potter ! I did n't know you were in town ! What can I do for you ? " " I 'm updating my last survey and I 'd like to get together with you to chat about Interlake . " " Of course . I 'd be delighted . But actually , I 'm sure , Mr. Sayre would like to speak with you himself . " Sayre was the president of Interlake . He 'd never had much time for me before the Yankee Clapper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested in falls into your department , I believe . " h ' There was a slight pause . Ever so slight . " I see . Well , unfortunatelythis is a crowded day for me . I have to attend a funeral flater this morning , and after that I have a luncheon appoint- I ment , and this afternoon there 's a directors ' meeting . " " I understand . I do n't think I 'll need much time , however . And I imagine Mr. Sayre would want you to be present anyway . " " Oh ? " " There 's a rumor I 've heard which on the surface sounds rather preposterous , but nevertheless I feel I should ask you about it . " He laughed . With all the sincerity of a department store SantaiClaus . " Then perhaps you should speak to the rumor division . f Mr. Lipp heads that . Rumors follow him wherever he goes . " He reconsidered . " I could break away from the luncheon early , I suppose . Can you be here at one-thirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then . I 'm on the twenty-first floor . " y " I 'm looking forward to meeting you . " " Righto , " Rasher said , and hung up . I put on my shoes and went out for breakfast . The photocopy shop was located in the John Hancock Center . It took the man only a few seconds to make a Xerox copy of the list . I returned to the hotel and mailed the Xerox to myself at the office . Then I used the original to make another copy in my own handwriting on plain white paper . This copy I put in my pocket . The original I mailed back to Vera . The Interlake Building was on North Michigan Avenue . It had been completed shortly before Lipp bought control of the company . It was a nice structure of glass and steel , but there wasnothing extravagant about it . J. J. Oliver had personally supervisedthe design and J. J. Oliver had never been one to waste a buck . The one concession to art which he 'd permitted was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough not to need a title , but it had one anyway  --  " The Helping Hand . " It showed a stalwartman who looked like Abraham Lincoln without the beard , lightly touching the shoulder of a woman whose head was bowed and who had a small child in her arms . Any of the art dealers I knew would have frowned at the statue as a creative work . Yet on the few occasions I 'd seen it I 'd found myself liking it . Not for its artistic merit but for what it said about J. J. Oliver . He was the one who 'd commissioned it , and I was positive that he saw himself as the Lincolnesque figure . As a businessman he 'd been plenty tough , and in its early years Interlake had undoubtedly dodged as many claims as any other insurance company , but there was another side of his personality : for most of his career J. J. Oliver had considered himself a protector of widows and orphans  --  and had taken the responsibility seriously . The statue was still there . Other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where the executive offices were located , had been completelyredone . In lavish style . The reception area now looked like the library of an English manor , and the stunning Japanese girl who sat facing the elevators was so dwarfed by the enormous desk in front of her that she seemed like a mere ornament . I gave her my name . She pushed a button and spoke into a brass and porcelain telephone . " Mr. Rasher will be with you shortly , " she said . " Would you care for some coffee while you 're waiting ? " I said I would . She got up and went into an adjoining room . I sat down on one of the tufted leather couches . The Japanese girl returned with a silver tray of coffee things . The coffee things were of Royal Crown Derby . I wondered what J. J. Oliver would have said. 58I sipped coffee and admired the calf-bound sets of books which lined the wall on both sides of a portrait of Anton Lipp . The atmosphere was hushed . Presently a door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elevators , saw me , hesitated , then detoured in my direction . He was a small man with a large head and lots of black hair . I recognized him immediately . He was Anton Lipp , looking much livelier in person than he did in the portrait . " Have n't we met ? " he asked . " I 'm Brockton Potter , " I said , getting up to shake hands . He pumped my hand vigorously . " Of course . " And to my surprise he mentioned the exact dates and occasions of our two previous meetings  --  a fund-raising dinner for Senator McDermottand a breakfast that Lipp himself had given for a group of security analysts to tout Computech . " You have an excellent memory , " I said . He smiled . He had the kind of mobile face that good actors have , and when he smiled it was n't only his mouth that moved  --  his other features went into action too . " I know . It 's often a handicap  --  it disconcerts people . To what do we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm being nosy . In a professional capacity , that is . " " Splendid . The company 's doing beautifully , as you probably know . Are you an astrology freak ? " The question startled me . So did his use of the word " freak . " He had n't come to the United States until he was in his middle teens , and he still had a slight eastern European accent . The colloquialism , coming from him , seemed strange . " . Not exactly , " I said . " Neither am I. But sometimes , I think , the stars do favor certainpeople . And the day I decided to buy Interlake they were definitely favoring me . " I nodded . " An extremely profitable company . Extremely . Who are you waiting to see ? " " Richard Rasher. " 59 " Rasher ? Not Sayre ? " He frowned . His frown was like his smile  --  everything went into it . " For present purposes  --  Rasher . " " Well , finish your coffee and let me take you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting . " I put the cup down . " The coffee does n't matter . I was admiring the decor , though . " " It 's a big improvement . Oliver was brilliant , but like so many men of his generation he pinched pennies . I 've never believed in that . It 's bad for morale . " He placed his arm on my shoulder . " Come along . " He guided me through the doorway from which he 'd emerged and down an L-shaped corridor . The corridor was thickly carpetedand hung with good pictures . Walking behind him , I noticed that he wore the same kind of shoes with platform soles that Irving sometimes wore . The two men were of about the same height . Rasher 's office was beyond the turn of the L. The door was open . Rasher was lighting a cigar . " You have a visitor , " Lipp said . " An important visitor . " Rasher dropped the match . It fell into an ashtray and went out . " Mr. Potter ? " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a cello . " How do you do , " I said . We shook hands across the desk . His hand was as soft and smooth as a satin pillow . " A pleasure , " he said . " I 've heard so much about you . " Lipp pointed to a chair . " Sit down , Mr. Potter . " I sat down . So did Rasher . " A pleasure , " he said again . For a man who was having all that pleasure , he looked kind of unhappy . He offered me a cigar . I declined . He made another attempt to light his own . His fingers were trembling slightly . I wondered who was making him nervous  --  Lipp or I.Lipp seated himself in one of the other chairs . He slid all the way down until his weight was on the lower vertebrae , extended60his legs , folded his arms and crossed his ankles . He assumed a grave expression . " Now then , " he said to me , " fire away . " I took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . I 'd intended to start slowly with general questions , then spring the list as a surprise . With Rasher alone it would have been possible . With Lipp present it was n't going to be . Nevertheless , I directed myself to Rasher . " What I 'm mainly interested in , " I said , " is your investmentportfolio . " Lipp spoke up immediately . " Are you here as a securities salesmanor a securities analyst ? " he asked . " A securities analyst , " I replied . I turned back to Rasher . " Then I 'm surprised , " Lipp said . " What could you possibly want to know about our investment portfolio ? It 's a matter of public record . " " It is and it is n't , " I said . " I know the general breakdown of your investments but not the specific stocks and bonds and treasury instruments that are included . " " It 's an enormous number of items , and they 're constantly changing . I 'm not an insurance man and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the company , so I myself do n't know what all of them are , but if you 're interested I suppose we could get you a reasonably current rundown . " He paused . " Are you interested ? Or are you merely leading up to something else ? " " I 'm not being devious , if that 's what you mean , " I said . " I really am interested in your investment portfolio . " " Very well . What particular aspect of it are you interested in ? " " The bonds , primarily . " " What do you want to know about them ? We own some of the best . " I glanced at Rasher . He was intent on his cigar . " I 'm not questioning your motives , " Lipp said , " but I can hardly believe that you came all the way out here just to ask what bonds we own . " " You 're right , " I said . " I 'm concerned not so much with what61bonds you own but with whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His eyes narrowed . " I beg your pardon ? " " When I spoke to Mr. Rasher this morning I said that I 'd heard a rather preposterous rumor . I 'm trying to check it out . " The room was very still . Lipp 's eyes were mere slits . " What did you hear ? " he asked . " I heard that a large number of the bonds that are supposed to be in your portfolio are n't there  --  that they 're missing . " His eyes widened . His lips parted . He grinned . " Be serious , " he said . " I am serious . I heard that there 's been a theft of securities from this company . " " A theft ? " " That 's the way it was put to me . " " Well , you certainly used the right term , my friend : preposter-ous . " " Twenty-three million dollars ' worth , to be exact . " Still grinning , Lipp turned to Rasher . " Can you even conceive of such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look amused also . " No , sir . " " You 're putting us on , " Lipp said to me . That line too struck me as incongruous . There was nothing really wrong with it , just as there was nothing really wrong with his hair , which he wore over his ears , or his clothes , which seemed more appropriate for a thirtyish movie director than for a sixtyish businessman . But there was something studied about it all . Lipp seemed to enjoy projecting the image of a man younger and looser than he actually was , which was all right with me . But why did he have to project it ? " No , " I said . " I did n't believe the story myself at first  --  and I 'm not sure that I do yet  --  but I have come into possession of a list of the securities which are supposed to have been stolen , and that makes the whole thing seem a bit more real . " I took the list from my pocket and put it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did . He pulled out a pair of halfmoonglasses and without opening them held them to his eyes . " Nevada Natural Gas 1989 's , " he read aloud . " Oklahoma Gas Transmission 1996 's . " He tossed the list to Rasher . " Do we own these ? " Rasher took the cigar out of his mouth , but did n't look at the paper . " Yes , sir . " " Where did you get that list ? " Lipp asked me . There was a lot of suppressed emotion in his voice , and the emotion was rage . " I 'm afraid I ca n't tell you , " I said . I wondered whether his hair was naturally black or whether he dyed it . " But do you think that there 's a remote chance that the story could be true ? " He let the emotion explode . " There 'd damn well better not be ! " He hurled his glasses across the room . " Goddamn it to hell , there 'd better not be ! " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leg of a table . The carpet was so thick that they did n't break . " I demand that you tell me where you got that list and who told you that story ! " Lipp shouted . I looked at Rasher . He 'd gone very pale . " That 's hardly important , is it ? " I said to Lipp . " The important thing is whether the bonds have been stolen or not . It would be awfully serious if they have been . " " Serious ! It would be a goddamn disaster ! We 're due to be examinedsoon by the Insurance Commission . " There was no reason for me to have been surprised , but I was . " In that case  --  " Lipp did n't give me a chance to finish . " You 're right , " he said , struggling to master his anger . " It does n't matter who told you the story ; what matters is whether it 's true . " He leaned across the desk . " What the hell 's been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people been up to ? " Rasher had jowls . They quivered . His voice was steady , however . " There 's been no theft , Mr. Lipp . I 'm positive . " 63 " How can you be sure ? " I asked . " I 'm positive , " he repeated . Lipp straightened up . He looked at me and smiled . " Forgive my bad temper , " he said . " My friends say I 'm mercurial . " His smile broadened . " My wife uses a less flattering term . " I smiled back at him . " I hope you 'll accept Rasher 's word , " he said . " I 'd like to , " I said , " and actually I do . But if there were some way of verifying it ... " " You do n't , then . Well , I do n't suppose I blame you . " His eyes went back to Rasher . " Why do n't we have a look in the vault ? " Rasher 's jowls started to quiver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 're acquainted with Mr. Potter 's reputation , " Lipp told him . " He is n't going to take anybody 's word . And if I were in his position I do n't think I would either . Perhaps he and I should both have a look . " " It 's against all the rules ! " Rasher exclaimed , his voice rising . He was beginning to get angry himself . " Ca n't we bend the rules a bit ? " Lipp asked . " Come to think of it , I 've never been to the vault myself . " " It 's not one vault ; it 's several . And there 's the board of directorsmeeting in a few minutes . " " To hell with that . Sayre can preside until we get back . " Rasher appeared to want to throw something too . He did n't do it , though . " We 'll have to have someone else with us , " he said stonily . " It takes at least two signatures to get into any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine . " " That 's sensible , " Lipp said . " Please make the necessary ar-rangements . " Rasher hesitated a moment , then yielded . He opened one of the drawers of his desk and took out a huge leather-bound notebook . " It would take us days to check every single stock and bond certificate , " he said to me . " Would you be satisfied with a spot check ? " " Of course , " I replied 64 " It would be easier , " he said , " if we only had to go to one of the vaults . But you can select which of the issues you 'd like to in-spect . " I studied my list . I picked several entries at random . Rasher checked them against the master list in the notebook , which evidently had been prepared by a computer . After some dickering , we agreed on three series of bonds , all of which were housed at the Monroe National Bank . My feeling was that if even one of the series was intact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three . Rasher put the notebook back into the drawer and picked up the telephone . " Tell Malcolm Davis to meet me in the lobby in five minutes , " he instructed someone . My stomach muscles tightened . I said nothing , however . Rasher went to a wall safe , fiddled with the combination lock and got the door open . He removed a large assortment of keys and selected one . " Shall I have one of the company cars sent around ? " he asked Lipp as he closed the safe . " Do n't bother , " Lipp said . " We can cab it . " We filed past Lipp 's glasses on the way out . He did n't stop to pick them up . Davis was waiting by the statue . He blinked when he saw me , and his ruddy complexion went a shade ruddier , but he did n't say anything . No one introduced us . We simply left the building , a silent group of four . Lipp flagged a taxi , and we got in . Rasher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back seat , but Lipp took up less , so we came out even . And Davis rode in front with the driver . Rasher and Davis signed the card . The attendants wheeled out the box . It was so large that they had to transport it on a cart , which one attendant pushed and the other pulled . They escorted us into a private room and left us . " The wealth of America , " Lipp observed to me as Rasher opened the box . " Fancy pieces of paper that are worth maybe fifty cents apiece . " " Until they 're sold , " I said. 65He nodded . I watched Davis as he went through the thick manila envelopesin which the bonds were kept . The envelopes were well identified by issue , maturity date , coupon date and serial numbers . He found the first series we 'd agreed upon and took the envelope out . Davis withdrew to an inconspicuous corner of the room . I could see immediately that all of the bonds were there . Nevertheless , I took out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All of them were exactly where they belonged , in their proper numerical order , with the correct number of coupons attached . The same with the second series . And with the third . " Are you satisfied ? " Lipp asked finally . " Yes , " I said . " Well , I 'm not , " he said . He asked for my list and searched it for another series of bonds which might be in the same box . He found one . He checked that series of bonds himself . It too was in perfect shape . Handing the envelope back to Rasher , he said , " False alarm . " " That 's what I tried to tell you , " Rasher said grimly . Davis went to summon the attendants . " Now , " Lipp said to me , " Perhaps you 'll tell us how you came by that list . " " I received an anonymous phone call the other night , " I replied . He gave me an enigmatic smile . " You 've gone out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm grate-ful . " The smile became less enigmatic . " I 've enjoyed it . " " And I 'm sorry I put you to so much trouble . " " Keeps us on our toes . We need that . " Davis returned with the attendants. 66 " You 'd be amazed , " Lipp said as we followed them down the corridor , " how much I own that I 've never even seen . Sometimes it frightens me . You have to rely on other people , I know , but I keep having nightmares about having bought something that does n't exist . " The cart went up the ramp and into the vault . Rasher went with it . We waited for him to return . I could n't think of anything to say . Rasher appeared . " Can we give you . a ride back to the office ? " Lipp asked me . I could have used the ride , for my car was parked in a lot near the Interlake Building , but I was suddenly anxious to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said . " I 'm going to make some other stops . " I had the feeling I 'd forgotten something . I thought for a moment and remembered what it was . " By the way , " I asked Lipp , " have you ever heard of a Clifford Jars ? " Half a dozen furrows appeared on his brow . " Is that a man or a company ? " " A man . " The furrows deepened . He rubbed his chin . " Afraid not . " I turned to Rasher . And was shocked by the look he was giving me . It was one of pure hatred . " How about you ? " I said . " The name means nothing to me , " he said stiffly . Lipp led the way to the escalator , and we went up to the ground floor . Lipp and I shook hands . " If you should ever find out who made the anonymous phone call , " he said , " I 'd appreciate your cluing me in . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The man would n't give his name , " I said . " That 's the truth . But he did say that he worked for Interlake . " " Thank you , " Lipp said . " Thank you very much . " He turned to Rasher . " Apparently you have a troublemaker in your midst . " " Urn , " said Rasher . " You ought to investigate , " Lipp advised him. 67 " Urn , " he said again . Davis said nothing . I told them all good-bye and entered the revolving door . With a moderately clear conscience and a deep feeling of relief. 6812Thursday got off to a good start . For one thing , Louise , my housekeeper , came to work on time , which she hardly ever did , and for another , the weather changed . It had been uncomfortablyhot and smoggy for weeks , but on Wednesday night the wind shifted , causing the temperature to drop and the air to clear . I 'd slept well and felt rested . Before going to bed I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my trip . Both had been as relieved as I was . Tom told me he 'd lined up buyers for Amalgamated Investors ' Philadelphia Steel shares and made a couple of other deals besides . Over a second cup of coffee I chatted with Louise about one of her grandsons , who 'd come up from Arkansas to spend the summerwith her and now did n't want to go home . I also asked her to put out some cheese and things before she left , as I was expectingguests . She said we were out of cheese . I gave her money to buy some . Sometimes I drove to work , sometimes I did n't . This morning I decided not to . The weather was too nice . I 'd walk part of the way , then take a cab . Strolling eastward on Eleventh Street , I paused a couple of times just to look around . I 'd lived in the neighborhood for a year and a half but still had n't got over the novelty of it . The strange blending of past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and backwater . It was n't typical of New York . It was n't typical of anyplace I 'd ever been , although in some ways it reminded me of Beacon Street in Boston and of the area around the Astor Tower in Chicago . The Astor Tower . Much of what had happened during the past few days still did n't make sense to me . I 'd done as much as I could for the time being , however . Evidently someone had wanted to make trouble for Interlake : Davis . And had probably had help : Harrington . Beyond that I could n't go . Future developments might provide additional answers . But then again , there might be no future developments . Strange man , Rasher . Lipp too , for that matter ; part financial genius , part ham actor . Vera Harrington ? I felt a pang of sympathy . Life was tough at times . Davis ? A downhill racer , not of the skiing variety . Any further conclusions would be pure guesswork . At the corner of Eleventh Street and Fifth Avenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the quiet churchyard . A half acre or so , straight from a European village ; an oasis of peace where you would n't expect to find it . I walked another six blocks , then hailed a cab , and when I got to the office I found that it was Irving 's birthday . One of the girls in the bookkeeping department had baked him a cake , and during the morning coffee break we had a party . Which made the day even nicer . Shortly before noon Jaime popped into my office , suitcase in hand , eyes glowing . He 'd come straight to the office from the airport and could n't wait to tell me what he 'd learned . BillingsSmithsonwas indeed close to developing a drug which would cure herpes simplex Type 2 , and the disease was certainly one which needed a cure  --  the effects could be terrible . Furthermore , if the drug would cure herpes simplex Type 2 , there was a good chance that it would also cure other viral infections which at70present were uncurable . I complimented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so thoroughly . He asked whether our dinner date was still on . I said that it was . He left to call Elizabeth . Right after that I received a telephone call from Dr. Chang . He wanted to say that he was about to return to Boston ; he 'd enjoyed talking to me and hoped I 'd look him up when I was in the area . No sooner had that call ended than another came in . From RodneyAlpert . Alpert was one of the art dealers I bought from . He told me that he 'd received some new canvases from Claude Gouletand thought I 'd like to see them . I said that I would . Goulet was a French-Canadian artist . I 'd met him at his first one-man show in New York and liked him . We 'd gone to dinner together , and I 'd purchased one of his paintings . At one o'clock Mark asked me whether I wanted to have lunch with him . We did n't often eat together , but he seemed reasonably mellow , and I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ martinis we talked about his favorite subject , the telephonebill . But when the steak sandwiches came he began to question me about my trip . I gave him all the details I had n't given him the night before . I 'd found I had to watch Mark rather closely at times in order to know how he really felt about things . His usual posture was one of not being interested , of considering the matter at hand as being unworthy of his concern . Showing emotion was , according to his code , bad form . He was as capable of emotion as anyone else was , I 'd come to realize , but you had to pay a lot of attention in order to detect what the emotion of the moment was . It thereforesurprised me when he made a face and said , " I just ca n't stand that man Lipp . " " I do n't know , " I said . " I 'm a little suspicious of him myself . But when you 're with him he kind of gets to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went out of his way  --  way out of his way  --  to cooperate with me . " " He comes on like the host of a talk show . " 71I smiled . " That was my reaction too . He 'd have done well on the stage . But you ca n't sell him short as a businessman . Look what he 's built . " Mark 's face continued to register disapproval . " Where do you know him from ? " I asked . " He 's a friend of my father 's . " That helped me to understand . Mark did n't care much for his father . He also did n't care much for people who spoke with foreignaccents or for people who were flamboyant . A flamboyant man who spoke with a foreign accent and was a friend of Mark 's father had , as far as Mark was concerned , three strikes against him before he even came up to bat . Mark changed the subject . " That list , " he said . " How do you know it was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't check out the handwriting . And even if the handwriting was Harrington 's , there 's no way of knowing whether the list was accurate or not . Someone could have deliberatelymade up a list of the wrong bonds , simply to mislead me . " " That 's what I mean . " " On the other hand , whoever made up the list knew exactly which securities are in the inventory . Even the serial numbers . There are n't that many people who 'd have access to such information . That does n't prove anything , I know , but somehow or other I have the feeling that the list was n't a fake  --  at least in the sense that someone was trying to make me look bad . " " You think , though , that Harrington and Davis were working together to stir up some kind of mischief ? " " It would appear so . Not for me but for Interlake . " " And that 's why Harrington was killed ? " " Who knows , Mark ? That 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their heads that he was mixed up with some kind of criminal outfit . His wife insists that he was n't , but you never can tell . The way he was killed indicates that a pro did the job , but you ca n't be sure about that either . Who knows what ele-72ments there were in the guy 's life ? He 'd begun drinking heavily , he and his wife were n't getting along so well , he was worried about something  --  for all I know , he may have been a gambler , up to his ears in debt to the loan sharks . In spite of what his wife said . " Mark nodded . " The one I did n't like , " I said , " is Rasher . " " Is he one of Lipp 's men ? " " Probably . He was n't there the last time I was in the office . A man named Jordan was treasurer then . But Jordan was due to retire soon , and I guess he did . I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other companies , possibly , or from some other insurance company . Or else he was at Interlake all along , somewhere down the ladder . I ca n't keep up with all the personnel changes . Wherever he comes from , though , he is n't my cup of tea . " " I wonder if Lipp attends all of the board of directors meetings or whether he just happened to be in Chicago for this one . " " I do n't know . Come to think of it , it might not have been pure coincidence that he happened to pass through the reception room while I was there . More than four hours had elapsed between the time I spoke to Rasher on the phone and the time I showed up at the office . " The waiter approached . He asked whether we wanted more coffee . We said we did n't . Mark asked for the check . The waiter went off to get it . " The bonds you saw , " Mark said , " were made out to bearer rather than to Interlake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said . " They could be cashed by anyone . " The waiter returned with the check . Mark outfumbled me . I was annoyed . We walked back to the office . But when we got to the entrance to the building I decided to stay out for a while . The weather was73so nice . And I was anxious to see Goulet 's new paintings . " See you later , " I said to Mark . He went into the building . I kept walking . I headed up Broadway . It seemed to me that there were just as many people on the street now as there had been in the days when stockbrokers were doing better and there were fewer computers . That everyone was in just as much of a hurry , just as unsmiling . That no matter which way the market was going , the folks who worked in the area called Wall Street seldom looked happy . After a few blocks I flagged a taxi and got in . " Seventy-fifth and Madison , " I said . The driver grunted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to wait in line at La Guardia for an hour before picking up a fare . He 'd had to go to Harlem . The passengerbefore me had only tipped him a lousy thirty-five cents after a trip from the Sherry-Netherland to 14 Wall Street . " The richer they are , the cheaper they are , " he observed bitterly . I thought of Mark . And fragments of our conversation at lunch came back to me . My own words , in particular . I wondered where Rasher really had come from . Perhaps I should find out , just to satisfy my curiosity . It was hardly worth the effort , though . For I was quite certain that , wherever he came from , he was one of Lipp 's men . Indebted to Lipp , afraid of Lipp. 7413The canvases were in Alpert 's office . He had n't yet got around to framing or hanging them . There were three . And all were magnificent . " It 's a new direction for Goulet , " Alpert said . " It certainly is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . The people of his native province , Quebec . Inhabitants of the small towns along the St. Lawrence River , north of Montreal . Poor , tough , wise , enduring people , weathered by hardship and the extremity of the seasons . His choice of such people as subjects was logical , for he was one of them . He understood them and loved them . He viewed the world as they did  --  but with broader knowledge than they had . He 'd traveled for six years before coming home to settle down in Trois-Rivieres , where he 'd grown up . Although I liked him enormously as a person , I did n't really understand him . A huge , burly , bearded creature who was only thirty-five but looked fifty , he spoke three languages and was inarticulate in all of them . And when he did express himself he usually did so in the form of questions , even when he was quite sure of what he was saying . He was fond of aphorisms , to which he always amended a " no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But despite his great size he managed to convey gentleness , and his difficulty with words had nothing to do with a lack of intelligence . He was75plenty bright . He just did n't trust himself when it came to speech . Painting was his way of saying things , and he preferred not to have to use any other . He 'd evidently undergone some sort of change , however . The new pictures did n't deal with people at all . They were landscapes . Stark seacoast scenes , painted during the late winter or early spring . A beached rowboat , half covered with a tarpaulin . Rocks . Melting snow . A lone gull . What they indicated was a concern with time and with solitude . " Where did he do them ? " I asked . " Nova Scotia , " Alpert replied . " He 's been up there since late February . " I studied first one and then another . Avidly . My appetite was whetted . I 'd begun buying art as a hedge against inflation , but was now buying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not knowing anything about it , I 'd let the dealers guide me . They 'd guided me into the blue chips of the art world  --  to the extent that I could afford them  --  much as a stockbroker would guide a novice investor into blue-chip stocks . After a while , though , I 'd found that there was nothing wrong with picking up a picture for no other reason than that it pleased me . Goulet 's work was a case in point . He was gaining recognition , and the painting of his that I owned was now worth more than I 'd paid for it . But I 'd bought it simply because I liked it . " They 're just great , " I said . " I 'm glad you like them . Claude will be too . He asked about you in his last letter . Why do n't you drop him a line ? I 'm sure he 'd like to hear from you . " " Maybe I will . Give me his address . " I continued to study the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I do n't know which . " " Take one home . See what it does for you . If you decide you want one of the others we can switch . There 's no hurry . " I nodded . We often operated on that basis . The picture belonged to Alpert until I was sure I wanted to keep it , but it hung in my house. 76He wrote Goulet 's address on a slip of paper and gave it to me . I put it in my wallet . " Take your time , " he said . I did . And finally decided that I wanted the picture of the gull . It said so much about survival . " Would you like me to drop it off at your house ? " Alpert asked . " Fine . I 'm going out to dinner but I 'll be home between six and seven . " " I 'll be there . " Riding back to the office , I felt very good . And at four-thirty I felt even better . For Tom had come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a new client : the Maryland Fund . He 'd been trying to get a portion of its business for two years and during a four-hour lunch at the Plaza with two members of M.F. 's top brass he 'd not only won them over but got their first order . To buy twenty thousand shares of Consolidated Business Machines . We had a drink , to celebrate . Mark joined us . And while we were drinking Jaime appeared , ready to go home with me . I invited him to have a drink also . " How was the trip ? " Tom asked him . " Better than I 'd hoped , " he replied . " Billings-Smithson are on to something . " " Like what ? " Jaime glanced at me , as if requesting permission to speak . This was n't unusual . People in my department often hesitated to revealinformation to people in the sales department without my consent , just as people in the sales department were , on occasion , reluctant to tell me the terms of a deal without first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies felt the same way  --  more loyal to their immediate superiors than to the company itself . I guessed that they did . " Like a cure for herpes simplex Type 2 , " I said . " Never heard of it , " said Tom . I told him what it was . " What 's the big deal ? " he asked 77Seeing that Tom had been given security clearance , Jaime proceeded to offer some of his newly acquired knowledge . " The virus was n't really isolated until 1967 . Now that it 's known , it 's estimatedthat about a quarter of a million people in the United States have it . It 's contagious  --  and very dangerous . Babies can catch it from their mothers at birth and become brain-damaged and a lot of other things . Some of them even die . " " I did n't know that , " I said . " It 's a fact , " Jaime said . " But that 's not all . It 's been linked to cancer . " Tom sat up straighter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cancer was important . " They have n't proved yet that it actually causes cancer , " Jaime went on , " but there 's evidence which points in that direction . Cancer of the cervix , mainly . " " Man ! " Tom exclaimed . " And Billings-Smithson will have the only cure ? " " There 's a German company that 's supposed to have one , but the Food and Drug Administration wo n't clear it for use over here . " " Man ! " Tom exclaimed again . " Herpes simplex Type 2 , " Mark said thoughtfully . " And what , may I ask , is herpes simplex Type 1 ? Who 's got a cure for that ? " Jaime shrugged . " A cure for that is n't so important . " " Why not ? " " Herpes simplex Type 1 is the common fever blister . " Tom laughed and said , " I give up . I 'm glad I 'm just a salesman . " He put his glass on the desk and got up . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and on since twelve-thirty . Enough is enough . " He left . And shortly after that Mark did too . Jaime relaxed noticeably . As if he 'd been under a strain with Tom and Mark in the room . " We 're all part of the same company , Jaime , " I said with a smile. 78He got my meaning . " I know , Brock . But you 're the one who hired me and you 're the one I 'm responsible to . And you 're the one who understands the problems . " I let the matter drop . He sighed . His expression became very serious . He hesitated a moment , then spoke . " I do n't think I 've ever really thanked you , Brock , for hiring me . " " Aw , come on now . " " I mean it . I love this job . I ca n't imagine anything else I 'd like as well . I stopped being religious a long time ago , but every morning I sort of say a prayer of thanks that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was embarrassed but pleased . " What you ought to be thankful for is that you have the kind of head that can handle the work . " " That too . And the education . If only more kids where I came from could get the breaks I got . " " You did n't get them , Jaime . You made them . " " Well , whatever . " He fell silent . Not for long , though . " About tonight , " he said . " I want you to be my guest . " " That was n't what I had in mind . " " Please . I want it that way . So does Elizabeth . " " O.K. If you insist . " " Thanks . And thanks for giving us the evening . I appreciate it . " Another silence . " Maybe , Brock , when we 're all together you could talk to Elizabeth . . . you could say something ... you could ... well . . . " He did n't finish . " Still the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're two grown people , Jaime . You know how you feel about each other . " " We love each other . " " O.K. , then . " " It 's just not that simple , Brock . We ca n't live just the two of us in a world with nobody else in it . There 're other people to think about . My mother 's taking it very hard that I want to marry out79of the faith . I know , I 'm twenty-nine years old and my own man and all that , and I 'm not a believer , in the old-fashioned sense , but , hell , I 'm all she has and she worked like a dog so that I could have an education , and to go against her . . . " He shook his head sadly and began again . " It 's the same with Elizabeth 's dad . Not only am I Catholic , but I 'm Puerto Rican , and as far as he 's concerned there is n't a Puerto Rican in the world that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know what I could say , Jaime . To you or to Elizabeth . " " It would be different , maybe , if we did n't both come from broken homes . But we do , see , and neither of us wants to have kids and put them through that . I mean , suppose it did n't work out . Suppose something happened . I mean , I promised myself one thing , Brock  --  I promised myself when I was no more than a little kid : if I ever had children , I 'd never leave them or let my wife take them away from me . I know what it 's like . So does Elizabeth . That 's what 's hanging us up more than anything else , I guess . " " Sometimes , Jaime , you have to be willing to take a chance . " He looked at me . The troubled expression went away . He smiled . " I know . But would you mind telling that to Elizabeth ? " " I 'll be glad to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost five . " What arrangements did you make with her about tonight ? " " She 's going to meet us at your place at six-thirty . I thought I could clean up there . I have an extra shirt in my bag . " " Fine . " We finished our drinks , Jaime picked up his suitcase , and we went out to tangle with the rush-hour traffic . The traffic was worse than usual . As the taxi inched its way up Broadway I began to have visions of Alpert bringing the picture to my house , finding no one there and leaving again . Louise never stayed later than four o'clock , even on the days when she did n't come to work on time . I suggested an alternate route , and the driver took it , but things80were no better there . When we reached Eleventh Street and UniversityPlace my patience finally ran out . " We can make better time walking , " I said . Jaime paid the driver , and we got out . We walked briskly to Fifth Avenue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to change . I gazed beyond the stream of cars to the First PresbyterianChurch . The day had passed very quickly ; it seemed no more than a couple of hours since I 'd stood at the same intersection , admiring the same building from a different angle . Jaime 's gaze followed mine . His reaction was different , though . " Churches always look so peaceful , " he said . " How come they make so much trouble for everybody ? " " Because they 're run by people , " I said . The light changed . We crossed Fifth Avenue . I could see a car parked in front of my house , where parking was n't allowed . I wondered whether it was Alpert 's . " Let 's hurry , " I said , and we quickened our pace . My house was in the middle of the block . As we drew closer I peered at the car . It was a black sedan . I could n't identify the make , but I could see two people in the front seat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an instant . The speaker was Eddie Marshak . He was six years old and lived in the building three doors east of my house . He was on roller skates and was clinging to one of the frail trees that bordered the curb . " Hi , Eddie , " I said . " I got skates , " he said . " For my birthday . " I smiled and nodded and took a long stride to catch up with Jaime . We reached my house . I looked at the men in the car . Neither of them was Alpert . The one on the curb side blinked as our eyes met and moved to get out . I turned and started up the steps to my front door , taking my keys from my pocket as I did so . A woman came out of the building next door . I recognized her . My neighbor Mrs. Negronsky . She stopped suddenly and , staring at something behind me , froze . " Look out ! " Jaime yelled , and gave me a hard shove. 81I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went down on one knee , dropped my keys and spun around . The man who 'd blinked was on the sidewalk . He was wearing gloves , and in his left hand he had a gun . In one swift movement Jaime flung his suitcase at the man and leaped between the man and me . There was a soft pop . Jaime stiffened . Mrs. Negronsky screamed . Jaime came down on top of me . I tried to get out from under him . Mrs. Negronsky continued to scream . An engine roared . Tires shrieked . Jaime rolled over . Blood was trickling from his chest and fromthe corner of his mouth . I looked around wildly . The car wasalready at the end of the block . Jaime 's suitcase lay on the sidewalk . Eddie Marshak was skating unsteadily toward it . " Call an ambulance ! " I shouted at Mrs. Negronsky . Jaime stared at me . I cradled his head in my arms . " Call an ambulance ! " I shouted again . Jaime 's eyeballs rolled upward , and while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robotlike state in which I could function but could n't feel . People came and went . Police officers , newsmen , my partners , Eddie Marshak 's parents , Mrs. Negronsky . Mrs. Negronsky and I took turns working with the police artist . Between us we managed to come up with a pretty good likeness of the man who 'd stepped out of the car and fired the gun . Eddie Marshak had noticed more than anyone would have expected . He supplied the information that the car 's left rear fender was dented and that Jaime 's suitcase had knocked the gun out of the killer 's hand . Neither Mrs. Negronsky nor I had seen the gun fall or the killer pick it up , but Eddie had . I had n't been aware that there 'd been another eyewitness , but Eddie had seen that too , and so had Mrs. Negronsky . A car had pulled up to the curb behind the killer 's car almost at the instant of the shooting , and the driver had honked the horn . That man was identified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gaines , who lived in the house to the east of mine , which had been converted into apartments , and he 'd come to pick her up . The police theorized that the suitcase had struck the killer a fraction of a second too late , that dropping the gun and hearing the honking of the horn had caused him to take off without firing a second shot . I was inclined to agree. 83At no point during the long hours of questioning did I get confused . At no point did I not know what I was saying and doing . But at no point was I a complete human being . My emotions were out of order . They did n't start working again until Friday afternoon . The jolt was enormous . I was standing at the corner of Ninety-sixth Street and Second Avenue . I 'd been to see Jaime 's mother , who lived in the housing project at Ninety-ninth and Second , and I 'd walked down to Ninety-sixth , trying without success to hail a taxi . And suddenly , as I stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so bad that I had to lean against the wall of a building for support . At the same time I lost all sense of my surroundings . The mental picture of Jaime 's mother sitting blank-faced on the side of her bed , fingeringher rosary , was so overwhelming that it blocked out everything else . As breakdowns go , it was very brief . The fit of trembling lasted only two or three minutes . It left me feeling weak , though , and I continued to lean against the wall , not sure of where to go or what to do . A pregnant woman came up to me as if to speak , then changed her mind and walked on . A brown and white dog sidled over to sniff at my shoes . Finally I felt sufficiently together to make anotherattempt to get a taxi . This time I succeeded . I gave the driver the address of my house but halfway there I changed my mind and decided to go to the office instead . For I was now able to face the fact which for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The fact that someone might have taken out a contract on my life. 8415 ......... The atmosphere was more subdued than usual . No one was smiling . Voices were lower . People were n't milling about . Helen Doyle gave me a startled look as I passed her desk . She brought in the mail and telephone messages and instead of leavingshe hovered beside my chair . " I 'm very sorry , " she said . " It 's a terrible thing . " I nodded . " Are you all right ? " I nodded again . " Is there anything I can do ? " " Not right now , Helen . Thank you . " Word that I was there got around fast . In less than five minutes both Tom and Mark were in my office , wanting to know whether there 'd been any new developments . I said that I 'd been to see Jaime 's mother and that I 'd met his fiancee at the mother 's apartmentand that Mass was going to be said at ten-thirty the next morning . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . " Not that I know of , " I replied . " I have n't seen them since this morning . " " They were here around noon , " Mark said . " I spoke to them . " " What did they want ? " I asked . " General information . About Jaime . " 85 " I 've been getting phone calls all day , " Tom said uneasily . " Anything special ? " I asked . He shook his head . " Just people wanting to know . " He looked as if he had n't slept any more than I had . " Would you like to stay at my place for a while ? " " Thanks , Tom , but I do n't think it 's necessary . " " I do n't know , " he said dubiously . " It might be safer . " I ignored the implication . But evidently he and Mark had discussedthe matter , for Mark said , " You should n't stay at home , Brock . Alone , I mean . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did n't know whether or not to interrupt us . I motioned for him to come in . Tom and Mark hung around until I said to Irving , " Sit down . We have a lot of rearranging to do . " Then , reluctantly , they left . Irving eyed me with concern . As if expecting to find visible scars . " Are you O.K. , boss ? " He only called me " boss " when he was emotionally shaken , which was n't often . " More or less . " " You had a close call . " " Very . " " Harriet 's back . She came in a little while ago . Everybody 's pretty upset . Including me . " " How do you think I feel , Irving ? " " I can imagine . " I considered what he 'd said . " Upset " had many meanings . And morale was important . " I 'll speak to everyone , " I said . " That 'd be a good idea , boss . Scotch the rumors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Like what ? " " Like that Jaime found out something that someone did n't want him to know , or that you did , or that we handle money for the Syndicate . " " The Syndicate ? Whose idea is that ? " 86 " Mine . " " Irving ! " " It would n't be unusual , Brock . Maybe without our knowing it . Plenty of brokerage houses do . " " Well , we do n't . To the best of my knowledge , at least . If the Syndicate has money in one of the funds  --  I suppose that 's possible  --  otherwiseno . Believe me . " " Then why , Brock ? Why would someone want to assassinate one of us ? Unless the TV guys are wrong , and the newspapers , that 's what it was like : an assassination . " " I have n't turned on television or read the papers , but it all happened so fast , I do n't know how anyone could be sure . " Irving did n't appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bunch . " Call everyone in , " I said . He left the office . I flipped through the mail . The second envelopefrom the top was addressed to me in my own handwriting . It contained the Xerox copy of Harrington 's list . I put it into the top drawer of my desk . I tried to think of what I 'd say to my staff . It took Irving no time at all to round them up . I watched them as they filed in . They were a grim-faced group . " We suffered a hell of a loss yesterday , " I said when they 'd pulled up chairs . " I 'm not going to pretend otherwise . It 's going to be tough to get along without Jaime , but one way or another we will . That I 'm certain of . Eventually I 'll find someone to replacehim , and when I do I hope that whoever it is will turn out to be as good as Jaime was . In the meanwhile you 'll all have to pitch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your regular work . Irving will make the decisions as to who does what . The main thing is to carry on . " There was no response . They did n't want a pep talk . " I do n't know what 's been going through your minds since you heard the news and I do n't know what you heard . The fact is , I myself do n't know what happened , or why . All I know is that twoit87men were in a car in front of my house and when Jaime and I started up the steps one of them got out and fired a shot at us . That 's all I know , and there were several eyewitnesses , and that 's all they know , and the police are investigating , but as far as I can tell they themselves do n't have any answers . " I looked around . Still no response . Generalities would n't do either . " A number of things have gone through my mind . First of all , the whole thing could be the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no understandable reason for doing what they did . Secondly , if they were n't crazy , if there was some plan behindwhat they did , it may be a case of mistaken identity ; they may have intended to kill someone and fired at us , thinking that we were the men they were after . And lastly , they may have really wanted to kill Jaime or me or both of us , but if that 's what it was , it 's going to be awfully hard for anybody to dig up a reason , because neither Jaime nor I nor this company has been even remotely involved in any criminal activities . " This time there was a response . It came from Joe Rothland . " The last possibility you mentioned , " he said . " I mean , that they knew what they were doing . It could be that one of us has run across something that 's more important than we think . " I gave him a sharp glance . He did n't flinch from it . He was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bulldog qualities that Irving had . " Take yourself , " I said . " Have you ? " " Not that I know of . But I may have . Or Jaime may . " " Or even you , " George Cole added . I shifted my gaze to him . He was the opposite of Joe . A tall , painfully thin , prematurely bald man of forty who looked more ascetic  --  and sounded more shy  --  than he actually was . " Possibly , " I said . " I 've made a lot of enemies recently , as a result of exposing Yankee Clipper . Is that what you mean ? " Harriet spoke up . " I should think it 'd be something more recent , " she said softly . She paused . " If that woman was right , and Jaime was trying to protect you . " 88Mrs . Negronsky , I thought . " If , " I said . None of them appeared to be satisfied . " I do n't know what else to tell you , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help ? " Irving asked . " If there is , I 'll let you know . Meanwhile I 'd like you to stick around for a few minutes after the others leave . " He nodded . The other three took the hint and got up . " I do n't think I accomplished much , " I said when they were gone . " Anything is better than nothing , " Irving replied . I repeated that the reassignment of work would be up to him , but I outlined how I thought he should do it . He told me not to worry . Then he asked me whether I wanted him to continue looking into Computech . " Yes , " I said . " I do n't suppose I should ask , Brock , but your trip to Chicago  --  could it be related to what happened yesterday ? " " I do n't know , Irv . " I thought it over . I definitely needed assistance . " I 'll tell you about it , and you can make up your own mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up his mind . We talked it over . He left . I took the envelope from the top drawer of my desk and opened it . I studied the list . Somehow Harrington seemed more real to me now than he had before . I pictured the house in Chicago Heights . I pictured the bulletriddenbody in the garage . I pictured Jaime on my front steps . Itried not to believe that the killer , having failed , would try again . I asked Helen to have Miss Jensen step into my office . I put the list away . Harriet came in briskly . She no longer looked as grim as she had before . " Is there something I can do ? " she asked eagerly . " Maybe , " I said . " Sit down . That relative of yours in Washington  --  is he still there ? " 89 " Uncle Bill ? " " The one who 's a lobbyist . " " Uncle Bill . Yes , he 's still there . " " How good are his connections ? " " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's what you mean . " " I 'd like some information . Maybe you can get it for me , through him . It would be in the Justice Department , in the FBI files , and it 's hard to get that sort of thing . " " I do n't know whether he can or not , but I 'll ask him . Does this have anything to do with Jaime ? " " It might . In any event , I 'd like it kept strictly between you and me . " Harriet squared her shoulders . She could be very purposeful . " Of course . What information do you want ? " " I 'm interested in someone named Clifford Jars or Yars  --  I 'm not sure how it 's spelled . " She repeated the names . " It 's only a guess on my part , " I said , " but there maybe a record on him in the Justice Department . " " In connection with what , Brock ? " " In connection with counterfeiting. " 9016A light went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the doorway . " You ought to go home , " he said . " What time is it ? " " Seven-thirty . " " I must have fallen asleep . " I tried to get up , but my body felt like lead . " How come you 're still here ? " " I did n't think you ought to be alone . " " Is anyone else here ? " Irving shook his head . " They 've all gone . Tom said his offer still stands . You 're welcome to spend the night at his house . " He eyed me critically . " You look awful , boss . " " Reaction , I guess . " " When did you eat last ? " I shrugged . I could n't remember . " What you need is a meal and a good night 's sleep  --  some-place . " I stretched . Even that was difficult . " I had in mind to go back to Mrs. Ortega 's . I was there this afternoon , but she was in such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " She probably still is . " " The only one who could get her to respond even a little bit was Jaime 's fiancee . " Which was true . By dying Jaime had brought91the two women together as he 'd never have been able to do if he 'd lived . " They may be better off left alone . " " I wanted to tell her that we 'd pay the funeral expenses and , in addition to the insurance , we 'd continue to pay Jaime 's salary for the rest of the year . " " You can tell her that in a few days . " A telephone rang in a distant part of the office . Irving frowned . " Maybe you 'd better answer it , " I said . " Everybody knows we 're closed . It must be a wrong number . " Nevertheless he went . Presently he returned . " It 's for you . A Detective O'Brien . On Charlie 's line . " I remembered the name but could n't associate a face with it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me the night before . I forced myself to get out of the chair . " We tried to reach you at home , " O'Brien said . " We wondered , Detective Sestino and me , whether we could come over . " Not again , I thought . " Of course , " I said . " How soon ? " " Well , I was just about to leave the office and go out for something to eat . " " Nine , nine-thirty ? " I sighed . " Fine . At my house . " He hung up . I sighed again . " More questions , " I reported to Irving . " I 'll eat with you , " he said . We went to Patricia Murphy 's restaurant . Because it was near my house , and because , despite that , I seldom met anyone there whom I knew . Irving was n't a drinker . An occasional glass of Rhine wine was about as far as he went . But now , before we even unfolded our napkins , he ordered a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seized the glass like an alcoholic. 92 " Suppose it is n't true , " he said . We had n't spoken in the taxi . Bone-weary , I 'd rested my head against the back of the seat and dozed off again . But his mind had evidently been racing , and he was merely voicing the last of a long chain of thoughts . " You lost me , " I said . " Suppose what is n't true ? " " Suppose there really is n't anything wrong at Interlake . " " I did n't say there was . " " Suppose Lipp does n't know anything about it . " " I did n't say he did . " " Well , then , you lost me . What were you talking about ? " " I was telling you why I went to Chicago and what happened when I got there . I said there may be a connection between that and the shooting . " I sipped my own drink . It tasted better than any I 'd had in years . Two more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the office I meant , Irving . It could have been a maniac , or mistaken identity . Or someone could have been trying to kill me . I do n't believe anyone was trying to kill Jaime . I believe Jaime saw the gun pointing at me and , being the kind of guy he was , he instinctively tried to protect me . " " Is that what you told the police ? " " No . It did n't even seem possible to me until this afternoon . " " Are you going to tell them now ? " The waiter , seeing that my glass was empty , came over . " Somethingelse from the bar ? " he asked . " Another Scotch , " I said . " Me too , " Irving said , and quickly emptied his glass . The waiter left . I pondered Irving 's question . " No , " I said at last . " But suppose  --  " Irving began . He lapsed into silence . " What could the police do ? " I said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot Harrington , you can be damn certain , any more than they shot Jaime . And the two killings may not even be related . And the bonds , if they ever were missing , 93have possibly been put back . All I 'd be doing is slandering a couple of men who are smart enough to make anything I said appear ridiculous . " " But suppose the police catch the guy who shot Jaime . They seem to have got a pretty good description . It 's possible . " " I hope they do . But if he 's a professional killer they may not . And if they do , and he is a professional killer , I very much doubt that he 'd tell who paid him . Guys like that just do n't . " The waiter brought the second round . " So what are you going to do ? " Irving asked . " Help the police as much as I can to catch the man who shot Jaime . And continue to look into Interlake . But really look . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we 'll take it from there . " Irving sampled his new drink . He was beginning to perspire . " But meanwhile , Brock , you have to protect yourself . " I wished that I knew how . I nodded , though . Irving dabbed at his upper lip with his napkin . " It seems warm in here . " Both of us fell silent . I thought about protecting myself . And about how destructive fear could be . I saw myself in hiding . The picture was n't attractive . I opened the menu . " Let 's order . " We did . I stared at the tablecloth . " Well , if it is n't the researcher ! " I looked up  --  and blinked . " Monica ! " She was smiling broadly . There was a man beside her . A tall man with a mustache . He seemed familiar . I recalled Carol 's words . The Grosses ' party . Victor Lane . I tried to think of something to say . " How was Long Island ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Monica replied . " An absolute orgy . " She sat down beside me on the banquette and said to her husband , " Sit down , Victor . Brock is a very close friend of mine . " She emphasized " close . " 94Victor sat down beside Irving . There was agony in his eyes . Monica did n't introduce her husband or show any interest in Irving . " Brock owns the loveliest Picasso , " she said , addressing all of us . " A nude from the early fifties , after he broke up with Francoise , I think . The sort of thing I 'd love to own . And some other choice items . " Her hand touched the inside of mY leg and began to stroke it . I never blush . But at that moment I began to . Irving looked at her with admiration . " Do you collect art ? " " In a small way , " she replied , continuing to stroke my leg , her hand moving upward toward my crotch . " Mostly my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Victor Lane and tried to remove Monica 's hand . She took it away but brought it back , this time placing it on my penis . " Brock seems to like it too . " I felt myself going from pink to crimson . I wanted to say something , but all I could do was swallow . Monica fingered my penis . " He has a definite feel for it , " she said to her husband . He made an attempt to smile . In spite of myself I began to respond . I was certain that Victor could n't see what was going on , yet I felt guilty as hell . I swallowedagain . " I 'm still learning , " I said in a tight voice . Monica laughed delightedly . " You know more than you think you do . " She addressed herself to her husband . " He really does . " " Jesus , " I said . " Look at him , " Irving said . " He 's blushing . " The waiter arrived with the shrimp cocktails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hand and slid out of the booth . " We do n't want to disturb your meal , " she said , " so we 'll run . Come along , Victor . " Victor was already on his feet . Monica stood there a moment longer . " Did n't I read something about you in the paper this morning ? Something about a shoot-ing ? " 95 " You may have , " I said . " A jealous husband , no doubt . " She gave me a parting smile . " It 's been lovely . We must get together again soon . " She took Victor 's arm , and the two of them headed toward the front of the restaurant . " Good-looking woman , " Irving observed . " Maybe you should n't be drinking . You 're flushed . " " It 's warm in here . You said so yourself . " He nodded and speared a shrimp . I picked up the lemon from the plate and gave it a vicious squeeze . Juice squirted into my eye . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better than I had before . Less tired . More alert. 9617I recognized both of them as soon as I saw them . They 'd been at my house the night before but had come late , after the patrolmen had taken my first statement . They were from Homicide . O'Brien was the older of the two . He was in his late forties , I judged . A stocky , blue-eyed man with hair that was in the process of going from red to gray . Sestino was at least ten years younger , and very Italian-looking , with black hair , olive complexion and big brown eyes that kept darting here and there as if he did n't quite trust the furniture . " I hope you managed to get some sleep , " O'Brien began in a friendly enough manner . " Not very much , " I said . He nodded sympathetically . " Sometimes it 's worse the day after . " " It did n't really get to me until this afternoon , " I admitted . " Then all of a sudden I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's , and right there on the street I damn near cracked up . " He nodded again . " It can happen that way . " His eyes narrowed . " Mrs. Ortega  --  the man 's mother ? " " Yes . " " You were pretty close to him ? You knew his family ? " " Close to him , yes . His family , no . In fact , he did n't have much97family . Just his mother  --  and his fiancee , whom you met last night . " Elizabeth had arrived at six-thirty , in the midst of everything . It had been a terrible scene . " I 'd never met his mother before . " " But you were close to him , you say . " " He 'd been with me less than a year , but yes , I guess you could say we were close . We worked together , and I liked him , and there was something about him  --  yes , we were . " Sestino 's eyes returned from another of their surveys . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , sir ? " " A good man . " " Good ? Good in what way , sir ? " " Good in all ways . His work , his feelings about people . Just good , that 's all . " " What Sestino means , " O'Brien said , " is , what we 're trying to get is a sort of picture of the man . Like look at it this way . A man just does n't get himself shot for no reason at all . Not usually . Usually there 's something about him , about the way he lives , who his friends are , that sort of explains things . Like if a man drinks or gambles or is involved with women or is hooked on something  --  you know what I mean ? " " I know what you mean , but there was nothing like that with Jaime . " " How sure are you about that , sir ? " Sestino asked . " Very sure . As sure as you can be about anyone you 've worked with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hired him I did some checking . Believe me , he was a fine human being . " " He was a Puerto Rican , though , " Sestino said . I looked at him . " I 've got nothing against Puerto Ricans , " he added quickly . " We 've got some on the force and we get along fine . But sometimes  --  well , dope , for instance . " " Not in Jaime 's case , " I assured him . " And yet , " O'Brien said , " somebody had it in for him enough to hire someone like Arco to hit him . " 98 " Arco ? " I asked . " Timmy Arco . He has quite a record . " " You know who killed Jaime ? " " Could be . We 're not sure , of course . But that picture you and the lady came up with , and the style of the killing , and the fact that the man was left-handed  --  we think it might be Arco . " " Who is he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A bad number . " He gazed around again  --  at the lamp , the table , the fern next to the window . His eyes came back to me . " Last anybody heard , he was in Cali-fornia . " " But before that , " O'Brien said , " he was a member of Sal Serafina 's outfit in Chicago . North Side loan sharking . An enforcer . Then after Serafina 's murder he put in with Tony Muratto , when Muratto took over Serafina 's operation . There was a rumor at the time that Arco 's the one who shot Serafina , on Muratto 's orders . It 's never been established , though . Anyhow , after Muratto got sent up , Arco dropped out of sight for a while . Recently he 's been seen around Los Angeles . " He paused . " He 's not the kind of guy you 'd want to get on the wrong side of . He 's been credited with six murders , not counting Serafina 's . " I tried to comprehend that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And he 's never been caught ? " " He 's been arrested plenty of times . What he 's never been is convicted . " " But that 's incredible . " " No , sir , " Sesti.no said . " It happens all the time . Lack of evidence . Whatever witnesses there 've been have either refused at the last minute to testify or have disappeared . " The temperature in the room seemed suddenly to drop . " The only crime Arco 's ever been convicted of was stealing a car when he was seventeen , " O'Brien said . " He drew a suspended sentence . So you can kind of see how anxious we are to find out all we can about this Ortega murder . " I nodded. 99O'Brien took a folded-up piece of paper from his pocket and handed it to me . " You might want to take a look at this . " I unfolded the paper . It was a Wanted poster . The photograph on it was unmistakably that of the man who 'd shot Jaime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same man . Wanted for murder : Timothy Arco , also known as Thomas Arch , also known as John Burns , 5 ' 11 " , 155 lbs. , brown hair , brown eyes , scar on right cheek , dangerous , and various other morsels of information . " That 's him , " I said with certainty . " That 's what the lady  --  Mrs. Negronsky  --  says too . And the Marshak kid seems to agree . " I continued to study the photograph . The man looked angry , but not particularly dangerous . An ordinary male with a small mouth and narrow shoulders , caught by the camera at a moment when he was in a bad mood . Six times a murderer . Maybe seven . Or eight or nine . O'Brien handed me another Wanted poster . " Recognize him ? " Paul Arco . Accessory to murder . " His brother ? " I asked . There was a resemblance . " Yes . He may have been the driver of the car . They often work together . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driver , " I said . Paul Arco appeared to be the younger of the two . His hair was lighter , and his expression was less grim ; he gave the impression of being startledto find himself in front of a camera . O'Brien sighed . " He 's never been convicted either . " " A good driver , " Sestino said . I thought of the car pulling away from the curb in front of my house . And of a car pulling away from the Harringtons ' . No one spoke for a few moments . " In this case , " O'Brien said finally , " it 'd be hard to get a convictionif we could n't prove a motive . " " And , " Sestino added , " there 's nothing about Ortega that gives us one . Everybody we talk to says the same thing : he was a great guy . " 100 " The thing that does n't exactly make sense , " O'Brien said , " is that the car was parked in front of your house . " He paused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have one . " I mean , " he went on , " someone like Arco , the way he operates , it 'd be more likely if he was going to hit Ortega , he 'd be waiting someplace around Ortega 's house . " " I see what you mean , " I said . " And the way Mrs. Negronsky saw it , Ortega was sort of trying to protect you . " " It happened so fast , " I said , " I just do n't know . " " So the thing is , it 's possible that Arco was n't trying to kill Ortega , if you know what I mean  --  he was trying to kill you . " They were fishing . But they were fishing in the right stream . And they seemed to be capable men . I was tempted to tell them about Interlake . The connection was too tenuous , though . Arco had probably never heard of Lipp or even of Rasher ; they 'd have made damn certain he 'd never heard of them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , " O'Brien said . " There 's always the chance that if someone tried once he 'll try again . If you know what I mean . " " Are you trying to tell me to be careful ? " I asked . " That would n't be a bad idea , " Sestino said . " But what we 're also saying , " O'Brien said , " is that you ought to think about why Arco was waiting outside your house . " My nervous system asserted itself . I shuddered . And for the moment that seemed to be enough for the two detectives . O'Brien got up , and Sestino followed suit . " We 'll be in touch , " O'Brien said . Sestino gave the room a final inspection . " That 's a nice fern , " he said . " I like plants . " I sat in the den for a while after they left , looking at the Wanted posters . The house seemed very quiet . And not particularly safe. 10118I had a nightmare . Two men were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He kept trying to get close enough to throw it . I ran around the corner from Eleventh Street onto Fifth Avenue , thinking I could escape into the churchyard , but the gate was closed and padlocked . The two men narrowed the distance between us . I made a desperate attempt to climb the fence . It was very high and had iron spikes on top . I grabbed one of the spikes and flipped myself over , landing on the grass . The two men followed . I raced across the yard toward the church house on Twelfth Street . The men had almost caught up to me now . The door of the church house would n't open . I banged on it with both fists . The man with the grenade pulled out the pin and drew back his arm . I awoke . My heart was pounding and my neck was damp with sweat . The inside of my mouth felt as if it were stuffed with dry oats . I turned over . The streetlight outside my window was still on , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I looked at the clock . Five-twenty . My heart continued to pound . Jesus , I thought . I went into the bathroom and drank some water . Then I went to the window and looked out . The two men I 'd dreamed about still seemed quite real . I 'd left my cigarettes downstairs . I wanted one but was reluc-102tant to leave the bedroom ; a killer might be lurking in the hall . I forced myself to open the bedroom door and went down the steps , turning on lights at the top and at the bottom . I found the cigarettes and lit one . Then , turning on more lights , I walked into the kitchen . I put a fire under the teakettle and spooned instant coffee into a mug . Waiting for the water to boil , I tried to explain away the noises I heard . The refrigerator switching itself on , the grandfather clock in the hall ticking at its usual pace , a car passing . But when the teakettle suddenly began to whistle I jumped , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the steaming water . The Arco brothers are back in California , I told myself . And no one would dare to make a second attempt . Gradually I talked myself out of the more irrational fears . But some of the rational ones lingered . If someone wanted me dead , Jaime 's death would n't satisfy him . I began to wonder whether I 'd be safer at a hotel . But that would be running , and I did n't like the idea . Besides , I could stay away from the house but I could n't stay away from the office ; I had a job to do , now more than ever . I took the coffee into the den and stood there , gazing at Goulet 's picture of the gull . Alpert had arrived shortly after the shooting but had seen the police cars and the crowd outside my house and , realizing that something was wrong , had driven away without coming inside . But the next morning he 'd phoned , and , being in that unnaturally calm state , I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now on the table next to the door , resting against the wall . Each of us is alone , it said . Each of us must survive . I thought of my father . And began to get angry . I damn well had to see things through . One quitter in the family was enough . At eight o'clock I was in the kitchen again , having a second mug of coffee and munching on one of the doughnuts Louise had made , when the telephone rang . The call was from Tom . He wanted to know how I was and103whether I wanted a ride to the church for the Mass . I said that I was all right , and that I did . He picked me up at a quarter to ten . He was n't as ebullient as usual , and there was a nick on his chin where he 'd cut himself shaving . We drove in silence until we reached Fifty-eighth Street . Then as we turned to go over to the East Side Tom said , " I do n't suppose you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I looked at him . Bravado , I thought . But I admired him for it and decided to show a little of the same . " Sure , " I said , " but I 'll have to buy a new racket first . " He gave me a startled glance and shut up . Was it only a week since the last time we 'd played squash ? It seemed more like a month . The crowd in the church was large . At least two hundred people . Most of them , aside from our office group , were Puerto Rican . Scores of older women with scarves over their heads , but a surprisingnumber of teen-age boys too . The boys sat in clusters , tieless , solemn-faced , impassive . Jaime , I guessed , had been their benefactor . He 'd occasionally mentioned little things he 'd done , like hiring a lawyer for some kid who was in trouble or getting a specialist for one who had a rheumatic heart . I paid my respects to Jaime 's mother , but she still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elizabeth sat beside her , pale but composed . She thanked me for coming . I found a seat in a pew next to Tom and two members of the sales force . Irving was in front of me , between George Cole and Harriet . I was surprised by how many of our employees had showed up . Even Clair Gould , our receptionist and switchboard operator , was there . I caught a glimpse of her on the other side of the aisle , a few seats down from Mark . Jaime had made friends , all right . His quiet personality had reached a lot of people . During the service I made an attempt to follow what the priest104was saying , but my mind kept wandering . I recalled the first time I 'd met Jaime . I could n't remember what had prompted me to speak to him or what we 'd said , but I remembered how noticeablehe 'd been , the one Puerto Rican in a room with a couple of dozen Anglo-Saxons . He 'd been hired , I later learned , less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to prove that it was n't prejudiced against minorities , which it had a reputation for being . Jaime had known this , just as he 'd known that he 'd never make it to the top in that company , but it was n't until he 'd come to work for me that he 'd begun to realize how cramped he 'd been , how much he was capable of doing . He 'd just started to grow . And now it was ended . I was dreadfully sorry . The pallbearers carried the coffin out through a side door . The crowd rose . Tom and I walked up the aisle without speaking . When we got outside we stood on the steps for a moment while our eyes adjusted to the sunlight . Ward Carlton and Milt Radison , the two salesmen , joined us . Irving came over , along with George and Harriet . No one said anything , but presently Harriet motioned for me to step aside with her . I did . " I talked to Uncle Bill , " she said in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington tomorrow . " " Go ahead , " I told her . We went back to the others . Mark approached with his wife . There was a round of greetings . Mark 's wife seldom came to the office , and most of the group had n't seen her in months . Mark eyed me . " Everything all right ? " he asked . I shrugged . " Did you bring your car ? " I shook my head . " Joyce and I 'll give you a ride . We 're on our way up to Green-wich . " " Thanks , " I said , " but Tom 's taking me. " 105His wife looked around at all the Puerto Ricans . " I wish I had a camera , " she said . Mark took her arm . " Come along , " he said . " It 's an hour 's drive . " They started down the steps . " We might as well shove off too , " Tom said to me . I nodded . We parted from the others and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hearse and of the limousine behind it . I thought of buying a squash racket , of going to the club , of returning to my silent house . And suddenly I knew that I just could n't hack it . " Never mind , " I told Tom . " I 'll go with Mark . " He opened his mouth , but before he could say anything I tookoff , pushing my way through the crowd on the sidewalk . I sawMark and his wife down the block and ran to catch up with them . They were getting into the car when I reached them . " I 've changed my mind , " I said . " I 'll go with you . " Joyce slid over to make room for me on the front seat . Mark got behind the wheel . He started the engine . " What 's the best way ? " he asked . " The East Side highway or the West Side ? " " Neither , " I said . " I want to go to Connecticut with you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a day or two . Until I can get my bearings . " " Sure , " Mark said . " The house is n't really open , " said Joyce . " We 're simply campingthere . " " I do n't want to be alone , " I said . That ended the discussion . Mark pushed the gear lever into drive and guided the car away from the curb . It was n't until we were on the Hutchinson River Parkway , skimming past Pelham , that I began to have second thoughts . Mark and his wife had n't invited me to be their houseguest ; I 'd thrust myself upon them . All I had with me were the clothes on106my back . And I was doing what I 'd never done in my life before  --  I was running away from something . It 's only for a couple of days , I told myself . I 'll come back on Monday morning . I 'm not afraid . I simply do n't want to be alone . But I had a hard time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however . In fact , it turned into one of the most enjoyable days I 'd had in years . The improvement was due partly to the locale . Mark 's house was situated near the Round Hill Country Club , midway between the Boston Post Road and the Merritt Parkway . I 'd been in the neighborhood before  --  once to see Mark and twice with Carol to visit business acquaintances of hers , people by the name of Ross , whose house was a couple of miles north of Mark 's . I 'd also spent a weekend with some friends of my own , the Dedmans , who had a place in New Canaan , which is also in Fairfield County , a few stops down the pike . Oscar Dedman was a banker who 'd befriendedme when I was just getting started . On those occasions I 'd found the area annoyingly perfect . Unreal . Too rich for my blood . I 'd been told that the people who live in that corner of Connecticut have the highest per capita income in the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for miles and not see a house that cost under a hundred thousand dollars , and most of them cost a damn sight more than that . Tough zoningordinances make it impossible for anyone to build on less than a couple of acres , and there are n't many houses which occupy plots that small . Like all sites chosen by people who can afford the very best , Fairfield County is beautiful . Rolling hills , meadows , brooks , ponds and a great variety of magnificent trees . But beauty is108easier to appreciate when you have something to contrast it with , and where Mark 's house was you did n't . Or where the Rosses ' house was . Or the Dedmans ' . North of the Boston Post Road , everything is nice to look at , and on past visits I 'd had the feeling that I was in a world which , being ideal , did n't really exist or , if it did exist , was too fragile to last . I 'd been uncomfortable . But this time I did n't have that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face value and simply enjoy it . The air was clear , the sun was bright , there was a nice breeze from Long Island Sound , and the birds chattered agreeably about where they were going to spend the winter or whatever well-fed birds do chatter about as summer draws to a close . Mark 's house was a twentytwo-roomwhite frame place that was built on a slight rise . The land in the back of the house sloped down to a pond , beside which stood the most superb willow tree I 'd ever seen . There were a couple of nice pines on the property also , and half a dozen oaks which , to judge by their appearance , had been growing there when Connecticut belonged to the British . Sitting on the terrace , sipping a Campari and soda , gazing at the trees and the pond , I forgot about the events of the morning . Forgot about most other things too . I began to think about matters such as what the country must have looked like before it got all cluttered up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from New York to Greenwich in the days of horses and buggies , and why trees in the South did n't grow to be as tall as trees in the North . I was alone at that point . Mark and his wife were playing tennis . They had their own clay court at the side of the house , and apparently they used it whenever they came up . I could hear the ping of the ball in the distance and the occasional sound of a voice . It was a delightful hour . There was something else that made the day good , though : I got to know Mark and Joyce as I 'd never known them before . And I got to like them better . It was strange . I 'd been seeing Mark five days a week for years. 109I 'd been with Joyce on any number of social occasions . And I had n't really cared for either of them . I could appreciate Mark 's good qualities  --  his intelligence , his eagerness to work even though he did n't have to , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him that put me off . His stinginess , his lack of warmth , his inability to trust people . And Joyce had struck me as being not only as stingy as Mark but also totally oblivious of everything beyond her own little world of Southampton , Palm Beach , Fifth Avenue and Greenwich . But I found , suddenly , that I 'd been wrong about both of them . Joyce was stingy . And she was no great thinker . And she did live in a restricted world . But she was nevertheless a good woman , utterly devoted to Mark , deeply concerned with the upbringingof their son , who was due back from a bicycle tour of France in another week , and practical . She was interested in sports , in animals , in nature and , for some reason which she herself could n't explain , in the problems of unwed mothers . She felt that there should be no stigma attached to illegitimacy and that unmarried women should be allowed to raise their children as freely and openly as married women . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her family and the small circle of friends she saw regularly . She had no desire to broaden that circle and regarded people beyond it as picturesque natives in a foreign country . But she did have a shy curiosity about how others lived . Including how I lived . She wanted to know why , when I could have a nice apartmentuptown , I 'd chosen to buy an old house on West Eleventh Street which had been converted into apartments and convert it back into a house . I explained to her what I liked about the house and the neighborhood and as I did I got the feeling that she was really making an attempt to understand . And Mark revealed facets of his personality which I 'd never suspected . Some were good , others were bad ; but I liked him better for all of them . He was , I discovered , a man of really110intense likes and dislikes . I 'd known , for instance , that he did n't get along with his father . But I was surprised by the bitterness with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparently , had always favored Mark 's sister and had deeply resented the closenesswhich existed between Mark and his mother . But what Mark held against his father more than anything else was his treatment of Mark 's mother , which according to Mark was harsh enough to drive her to alcoholism . And when she 'd become an alcoholic and Mark wanted his father to send her to Silverhill for treatment , the old man had refused . With the result that during a night of solitary drinking she 'd fallen down a flight of steps in her own house and broken her neck . It was shortly after that that the final rupture occurred between Price senior and Price junior . On the other hand , Mark 's affection for his wife , his son , his in-laws and certain people in our company was deeper than I 'd imagined . Furthermore , he was privately supporting an old chauffeur and housekeeper who 'd been with the family when he was a boy and who were no longer able to work . Also three South Vietnamese orphans whose plight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We talked about Tom , whom Mark liked but worried about . What made Tom such a good salesman , in Mark 's view , was his basic insecurity . He had a constant need to prove that he was worthy and he satisfied it by accumulating friends , then turning the friends into clients . But the insecurity that made Tom a good salesman made him a risky partner . There was no telling what he might do if he ever felt acutely threatened . We talked about me too . For the first time Mark told me what he thought about me . What he thought about me was n't bad . He had a higher opinion of me than I 'd believed . But he said something that bothered me . He said that I was by nature a moralist and a reformer and that I enjoyed finding the worms under the stones . I did n't agree with him then and I 'm not sure that I do now , but the statement has stuck in my mind. 111I ca n't fully account for the closeness that developed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the things that contributed to it , I think , is the fact that the house really was , as Joyce had said , closed . It 's hard to be stand-offish when you 're eating in the kitchen and lounging around on furniture that 's covered with sheets . I 'd known that they had n't been using the house much for the past year but I had n't known that they 'd given up trying to maintainit as more than a place to sleep every now and then and were actually trying to sell it . That was the case , however . Too hard to get help . Too expensive . The couple that worked for them in the city would n't come to the country , and they had n't found anyone in the country who wanted to come to the city . Even without domestic help , Mark told me , the house was costing him twentyfivethousand a year . The landscape service alone ran seven hundreda month , and if the grounds were n't kept up the house would be more difficult to get rid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takers anyway , for the area was full of people who wanted to unload their big places , and the market was glutted . My own opinion was that Mark could actually afford the house but was just tired of it . Nevertheless , it was for sale , and the Prices were living like squatters on their own property , and that made for a certain informality which would n't have existed otherwise . Joyce fixed lunch herself . We 'd stopped on the way up at an A &; P on the Boston Post Road , and she 'd bought provisions  --  a loaf of bread , six slices of Swiss cheese and two tomatoes  --  which she seemed to feel were adequate . For dinner we went out to a restaurant called The Gaslight , which looked like an ordinaryroadside joint but was an exceptionally good , and expensive , French restaurant . And on Sunday they planned to do most of their eating at the party they were invited to  --  a tea which the Hansfords were giving for their daughter Patricia , who was making her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them . Aside from playing tennis , Mark and his wife did n't do very112much , and I did even less . I sat on the terrace , walked around the grounds and accompanied Mark and Joyce on a ride to Darien to visit Joyce 's horse , a big brown filly named Martha , which she was boarding at the Ox Ridge Hunt Club . While Joyce and Marthawere having their reunion I strolled through the stable , admiringsome of the other horses . The Ox Ridge Hunt Club , I gathered , was the Waldorf-Astoria of the Connecticut horse world , and the animals quartered there seemed to know it ; they were a contented-looking bunch . At eleven o'clock Joyce went upstairs to bed , and Mark and I had a nightcap in the kitchen . From the moment we 'd left New York neither of us had mentioned Jaime . But now the subject came up , more or less by accident . " You will go to the Hansfords ' with us tomorrow , wo n't you ? " Mark asked . " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never been to a debut party and had no particular desire to go to one . I was even a bit surprised that families were still giving them . " I was n't invited . " " What the hell , you 're with us ; that 's good enough . They 'll be glad to have you . " " I did n't bring any clothes . Not even a clean shirt . " " You can wear one of my shirts . It 'll fit . You 'll look all right . Any suit that 's O.K. for a funeral is O.K. for a debutante tea . " He frowned . " Well , you know what I mean . " I said nothing . He continued to frown . " I 'm sorry about Jaime . He seemed to be taking hold quite well . " I nodded . " Better him than you , though , Brock . " " Let 's change the subject . " " Of course , " Mark said quickly . Apparently I did n't really want to change the subject , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been me , Mark . I 'm the one the guy was aiming at . " 113Mark gave me a somber look . " That thought has crossed my mind . " " It 's crossed the minds of the police too . A couple of detectives from Homicide were over last night , questioning me . They did n't come right out and say it , but they hinted . " " What did you tell them ? " " What could I tell them ? I could n't tell them about Interlake , because I still do n't know that there 's anything wrong there  --  and I do n't think the police have the means to find out . But I 'm going to keep digging and if I do find anything wrong I 'm going to make damn sure the police know about it  --  the police and the Illinois Insurance Commission and everybody under the sun . I 'm going to let out such a howl that there 'll be no way an investigation can be avoided . " " Do you think that 's smart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , Mark . The police know who shot Jaime . A professional killer named Arco . They showed me his picture . I 'm positive he 's the one and I said so . What they 're looking for is a motive , and so am I. Because as long as anyone has a motive , it does n't make any difference whether Arco is caught or not  --  I 'm still in danger . " " And you think Lipp is behind the whole thing ? " " I do n't know . But I ca n't think of anyone else who might be . What do you think ? " Mark was silent for a while . " I think he might be , " he said finally , and added , " I 'm glad you 're up here . " " I 'm glad I 'm up here too , " I said . " Because frankly , pal , I 'm scared . " " Maybe you ought to stay on for a little while . Joyce and I 'll drive back tomorrow night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can lay in a supply of food and just camp , the same as we do . " That idea had n't occurred to me . I considered it . " I 'm afraid not , Mark . I could hide for a little while but sooner or later I 'd have to go back . " 114 " I suppose you would . But meanwhile if the police know who the killer is they may catch him , and that might make a differ-ence . " " It might , " I said . But I did n't really believe that it would. 11520I awoke early , dressed , made my bed and went downstairs . The house was quiet . I strolled into the kitchen and found some coffee . I also found what was left of the loaf of bread Joyce had bought . No butter . But dry toast and black coffee were better than nothing . After breakfast I went outside . The weather was n't as nice as it had been before  --  fast-moving clouds were sweeping across the sky , and there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I wandered down the driveway toward the road and presently heard a strange clopping noise . I could n't identify it and went to investigate . An elderly gentleman in a red riding jacket and black velvet jockey cap was approaching on horseback . He was accompanied by his groom , a young black man , also on horseback . I stared at them . The elderly gentleman smiled and said , " Good morning . " I managed to say , " Good morning . " I watched them , bemused , until they 'd disappeared around the bend . And as I turned to go back to the house I found that I 'd been joined by a rabbit . The rabbit was gazing at me with some doubt , as if pedestrians were as puzzling to him as equestrians were to me . " Hello , Harvey , " I said , but evidently that was n't the rabbit's116name , for he simply did an about-face and loped off across the grass . I walked down to the pond and listened for a few minutes to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice place , I thought ; a really nice place . And I considered Mark 's suggestion that I stay on for a few days . It was n't such a bad idea . I could pick up some clothes in Greenwich , rent a car , eat at various roadside restaurants , keep in touch with the office by telephone . I could n't decide . And while I was still weighing the pros and cons Mark came out . " You scared me , " he said amiably . " I thought you 'd been kid-napped . " " No , " I said . " I was just asking that frog whether I ought to buy the place . " " I hope to God he said yes . " " He said I could n't afford it . " We went up to the house . Joyce was at the kitchen table , drinkingcoffee . Mark had evidently told her that I might extend my visit , for she began to explain about the appliances . There was something wrong with the left front burner of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold-water faucet on the sink had to be turned all the way to the left , otherwise it dripped . " I still have n't made up my mind , " I said . " It might be wise , " she said . " Under the circumstances . " I did n't ask her how much she knew about the circumstances . I said , " We 'll see , " and let it go at that . " There 's plenty of booze in the cabinet behind the bar , " Mark said , " but be sure you lock it when you leave . I 'll give you the key . " In their own way , I realized , they were trying to protect me . They went out to the tennis court . I found my way into the library . The room had a musty smell . I examined the books . There were some nicely bound sets of various English novelists , 117including the collected works of Sir Walter Scott , which took up several shelves . There was also an ancient edition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impulse I pulled out a five-year-old edition of Who 's Who in Commerce and Industry , the most recent one I could find . I looked up Richard Rasher . He was n't listed . So I settled down with Volume I of Ivanhoe . Later in the morning Mark took out a backgammon set , and we played backgammon until my stomach began to growl . " How about some lunch ? " I suggested . " Are n't you going to the party ? " Mark said , surprised . I still had n't made up my mind about that either , but I said , " Even so . " He said he was n't hungry , although I did n't see how he could n't be . Instead , he gave me the keys to the car and told me how to get to the nearest McDonald 's . I went . I had a hard time finding the place and an even harder time finding my way back . I could n't remember the corner at which I 'd turned onto the Boston Post Road and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a street that looked like Round Hill Road but was n't . Then , in trying to get over to where I thought Round Hill Road was , I took various lanes , drives , terraces and courts , all of which ended in immaculately landscaped dead-end circles . And when I finally did locate Round Hill Road I turned right instead of left and presently found myself crossing the Merritt Parkway . I did n't get back to Mark 's house until almost three o'clock . He looked as if he 'd been genuinely worried , but he did n't say so . He merely said that Joyce had gone upstairs to dress and that he 'd put a clean shirt in my bedroom . " But I 've been thinking , " he added . " Maybe it 'd be better if you did n't go to the party . If you do n't want people to know where you are , that is . " I 'd decided by then , however , that I 'd had enough of the Con-118necticut countryside and would go back to New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said . " I 'll go to the party . " The Hansford place was so far from the road that you could n't even see the roof . You could tell that something was going on , though , for there were two policemen at the gateposts , directing traffic . There were cars everywhere , and attendants parking them . I counted over twenty Mercedes-Benzes alone . The house itself , when at last you got to it , was a huge , sprawlingNorman affair with a flagpole extending from the portecochere . There was no flag on the flagpole , but the mast was encircled by ropes of green leaves and white orchids . Joyce introduced me to the Hansfords , who stood in a receiving line at the foot of a curving staircase that was hung with flowers like the flagpole . Papa Hansford , Mama Hansford , the three Hansford girls  --  Patricia , Esther and Rosemary  --  both sets of grandparents and a few other people whose relationship to the family was more obscure . All of them said they were glad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the party was being given . She offered me a sort of cold over-the-shoulder how'd'ya do . But there was nothing personal in it ; she offered everyone else the same greeting . She was a slender , good-looking girl with straight blond hair , but either she had n't wanted the party or she 'd done the receiving-line routine too many times in the past , for she looked terribly bored . There was an orchestra on the terrace . There were bars indoorsand outdoors , buffet tables in the dining room and on the lawn . A small platoon of waiters kept circulating with trays of champagne and hors d'oeuvres . Everything that could be wrapped with white orchids was wrapped with white orchids , and a rope of them had been placed around the swimming pool . I headed first to the indoor bar , then to the outdoor buffet table . McDonald 's had n't done all that much for me , and I was still hungry . A salmon at least three feet long shimmered through an119aspic of the same length . One waiter was carving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenderloin . There were bowls of iced shrimp , platters of salads , a couple of chafing dishes of lobster Newburg and a pastry tray that included every kind of fruit , custard and chocolate concoction I 'd ever seen . I wondered what , if this was tea , a dinner might consist of . But that did n't keep me from enjoying it . I took my plate over to a quiet spot beside a bush which had been trimmed to resemble a mushroom and surveyed the scene as I ate . There was a moderate amount of action on the terrace . Older couples were dancing to something that sounded like a fast samba , and most of them appeared to be quite good at it . Presently , however , the orchestra quit for a break and a small rock group took over . The crowd on the terrace grew at that point , some of the older people remainingand a flock of younger ones joining them . Bodies began to move rather violently as the strongly accented notes poured from the amplifiers . I noticed one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the girl maybe sixteen . He was a better dancer than she was . It seemed to me that I 'd met him before , under somewhatdifferent circumstances , and after a few minutes I realized that I had . He was John Patterson , the principal stockholder in the company that controlled Amalgamated Investors Services . Hardin Webster 's boss . He looked a lot different now from the way he 'd looked in his office in Boston . There were a few other people I also recognized . Melvin Lamson , president of Consolidated Carbide . Dick Welch , chairman of the board of Welch and Rooney , the real estate firm that managed the building in which we had our offices . The former wife of one of the senior partners in the brokerage house where I 'd met Tom . I made no attempt to get into things , but when I finished eating I did wander around a bit . First to the swimming pool , which was being presided over by two white poodles and enjoyed by two young men who 'd taken off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the house to inspect something that looked like a maze and turned out to be one . And finally into the house to see what Mark and Joyce were up to . Joyce was standing by a French window , drinking champagne and talking to a friend of hers whose name I did n't catch . Mark , she said , had been at the bar the last time she 'd seen him and was drinking too much  --  would I please try to slow him down ? I said I would if I could and went off to locate him . Crossing the foyer , I found the Hansfords still in position at the foot of the staircase , greeting new arrivals . I smiled at Mrs. Hansford , who 'd forgotten that we 'd already met and told me how glad she was that I could come . She called me Harry . The bar , as I recalled , was in a room next to the living room . I started toward it . The living room was crowded with people coming and going , drinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , but there were so many people trying to get through the doorway that I had to go in sideways . And as I did I brushed against a man who was trying to get out . He too was moving sideways . " Brockton Potter , " he said . " What a pleasant surprise . " It was Anton Lipp. 12121Once , while in college , I 'd gone with a friend to visit his parents at their summer home in northern Wisconsin . The house was by a lake , and the second afternoon I was there I went swimming alone and stretched out afterward on the dock to sun myself . I fell asleep . And awoke suddenly to find a black widow spider crawlingtoward me . The spider was the size of a quarter and was , at the moment I saw it , about two inches from my right armpit . The sensation I 'd had then was the sensation I had now . But there 'd been more room to maneuver on that dock , narrow as it was , than there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said hoarsely . Lipp eyed me with a pleased expression . " I 've been thinking about you . " I tried to smile . It did n't work . Someone said , " Excuse me , " and gave me a push . I went on into the room . Mark was standing by the window , holding a tall glass . I worked my way over to him . " I just saw Anton Lipp , " I said . Mark nodded . " So did I. " " Did he say anything ? " " He asked about you . I did n't tell him you were here . " I glanced around . We were in a sort of sun room . The only way out was through the same doorway by which I 'd come in . It hardly mattered , though , since Lipp already knew I was there. 122 " Maybe you ought to talk to him , " Mark said . " And tell him what ? " Mark shrugged . He did n't seem drunk to me , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . " You could use another drink yourself , I imagine . " I felt as though I could . I went over to the bar and asked the bartender for a Scotch . " A strong one , " I added . The bartender obliged . Perhaps Mark was right , I thought . Perhaps I should talk to Lipp . He was n't hard to find . He was in the living room , only a few yards from where I 'd last seen him . " Lovely party , " he said . " Lovely , " I agreed . " Have you known the Hansfords long ? " " Not very . And you ? " " For some years . Patricia and my daughter were at school together . " He 'd been smiling , but suddenly , in one of those quick changes of expression that were characteristic of him , his face darkened . A waiter came by with champagne . Lipp deftly swapped the drink in his hand for one of the glasses on the tray . His face brightened again . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other day . " " Just doing my job . " " And an interesting job it must be . You have a mind like mine , I think . " " What kind of mind is that ? " " Inquisitive . I could use a man like you . " I looked at him . He was dressed like a number of other men I 'd seen at the party , in sports jacket and slacks . But somehow his appearance was different from theirs . His jacket was of a paisley print , the slacks were tailored to show the contours of his legs , and he was again wearing shoes that added to his height . Among123other things , I thought , he 's vain . " Are you offering me a job ? " I said . " Anytime you want it . Name your own price . " " I 'm flattered . I like what I 'm doing , though , and where I 'm doing it at . " " It has its exciting moments , I suppose . Did n't one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to me I heard something to that effect . " " Yes . A very nice guy . " " That 's a shame . A person never knows what fate has in store for him . " " That 's true . But I think the police will get to the bottom of the matter . " " Do you ? " " Definitely . " Lipp started to say something , but at that moment the man I 'd seen dancing with the young girl on the terrace came up to us . " Anton ! " he exclaimed , taking Lipp by the arm . Lipp 's eyes , which had become grave , immediately began to glow with delight . " John ! " He turned to me . " Do you two know each other ? " Patterson 's brow furrowed . " Are n't you Brockton Potter ? " I said , " I am . " The furrows vanished . " I thought so . I owe you a debt of thanks . You 're the one who got us out of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I smiled . It was nice to meet someone who , when it came to Yankee Clipper , was n't mad at me . " Just tell your people to keep giving us their business . " " What do you think of Computech at the moment ? " he asked mischievously . " Well , " I said , " our best source of information is standing right here . " " You could n't make a better investment , " Lipp said and chuckled. 124Patterson tugged at Lipp 's arm . " Do you mind if I ask you a question , Anton ? " " Of course not , John . " The'two of them walked over to the other side of the room . Lipp kept looking my way as they talked . I felt certain now that Amalgamated'sdecision to sell Philadelphia Steel and buy Computech had come as a result of information which Lipp had given to Patterson . I waited a couple of minutes to see whether Lipp would return . He did . Without Patterson . " What were we talking about ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfortunate young man who was killed . " " That 's right , " I said . " And speaking of unfortunate men , I read in the paper when I was out in Chicago that one of the Interlake people had been shot , more or less like my man was in New York . " Lipp sighed . " The world is full of crime , is n't it ? " " So it seems . " I wondered why he was n't using any of his mod expressions . Evidently he could turn that kind of talk on and off as readily as his smile . " You should  --  " he began , but again we were interrupted . This time by none other than Patricia Hansford . " How 's Francesca ? " she asked , wrapping both her arms around Lipp 's free one . He regarded the debutante fondly . Then his face clouded over . " About the same , " he replied . " Give her my best , " Patricia said . She released his arm and went toward the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his hand as if he suddenly wanted to hurl it at someone . " I hate parties like this ! " he said savagely . " I should n't have come ! " I was so startled that I took a step backward . " Forgive me , " Lipp said . " I get carried away . Francesca 's my daughter , you see . " I said nothing. 125As if he did n't trust himself to hold it any longer , he put the glass on a nearby table . " I would n't have come today but I was in the neighborhood . Francesca 's at Silverhill . " I had n't even known that he had a daughter . All I 'd known was that he was married for the third time . " The sanitarium ? " He nodded and reached into his pocket for a cigarette . He lit it with a trembling hand . I did n't know what to say . " I 've heard they have a good staff there , " I said . " Good ? They have n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one has ! I 've had her everywhere ! " His voice was quivering with rage . He made an effort to control it . " For sixteen years she was fine . Perfectly fine . A normal , healthy girl . Then all of a sudden she stopped talking . Just stopped . She has n't spoken a word in three years . Not to anyone . " His voice began to quiver again . " And no one 's been able to do anything ! No one 's been able to help her ! " He dropped the lit cigarette onto the white carpet , let it lie there for a moment , then ground it out with the toe of his shoe . I looked at the burn mark on the carpet . And at Anton Lipp . I was certain that he 'd lit the cigarette simply to do damage with it . " I 'm sorry to hear that , " I said , and turned abruptly away . I walked quickly out of the room and found my way to the terrace . Skirting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I felt , just then , that I knew as much about Anton Lipp as I 'd ever need to know . He was a man who could n't accept adversity . Who , when hurt , had to destroy . A man like that , I thought , is capable of anything. 12622It was nine o'clock when we got back to the city . Mark said that I was welcome to continue staying with Joyce and him , in their apartment , but I declined . I 'd be safe enough at home , I told him  --  and I tried to convince myself that I would . Should there be another attempt on my life , it would n't occur in the same spot . In fact , my house was probably the safest place for me . The killer would think it was being watched by the police . And perhaps , without my knowing it , it was . So Mark drove me to West Eleventh Street . He insisted on cominginto the house with me . We looked around . No one jumped out from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left it , including the empty coffee mug on the kitchen table . But after Mark left I began to regret my decision . For the uneasinessI 'd felt on Saturday morning returned . I tried to talk myself out of it but could n't . Not altogether . Which made me angry . How long could this go on , damn it ? I took two Nembutal capsules and went to bed . The capsules worked . I slept for eleven hours and would have slept even longer if the telephone had n't rung . The call was from Louise . She could n't come to work ; her grandson was sick . I asked what was wrong with him . She did n't know , she said . She sounded evasive . I wondered whether she 'd been questioned by the police and alarmed by them , and since127there was no point in beating around the bush I asked her . That was the problem , all right . She did n't need no police in her life , she said , and suggested I find someone to replace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avail . Exit one good housekeeper . It was the first time in years that I was late for my Monday staff meeting . I did n't get to the office until ten-thirty . Everyone seemed relieved to see me . Irving took me aside before the meetingstarted , to tell me that he was afraid something was wrong with Harriet . She had n't come to work , and he 'd called her apartmentthree times without getting an answer . I explained that she 'd gone out of town . He waited for me to say where she 'd gone , and when I did n't he snapped , " I wish you 'd let me know when you make decisions like that . " I said I was sorry . The meeting did n't last as long as usual . For one thing , everyone was conscious of the fact that there were only four of us and seemed ill at ease . For another , the market was having a rally . The industrials had gone up eight points in the first hour of trading , and no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply a technical reaction  --  the short sellers were covering . George thought that the market was anticipating favorable quarterlyreports from General Motors and some of the other leaders . Joe predicted that the rally would n't last , and I was inclined to agree with him . But at eleven-fifteen I sent him out to check , and the industrials were up another two points . We finished our business and dispersed . I asked Irving to let me know what was happening with Interlake and Computech . He inquired and reported back that Interlake was up an eighth and relatively dormant . But Computech was up three points and was one of the most active stocks on the board . " It figures , though , " he said . " The bulk of the action is coming from our own office . We 're executing the Amalgamated buy or-ders . " " Are we handling both sides ? " I asked 128 " I do n't know . " " Find out . " " Will do . " He went out but returned shortly . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handling both sides for some , not all . " " Ask him who 's selling the stock that Amalgamated 's buying . " " I did . He only knows about the deals we 're handling . The sellers are the Bank of Northern California and the Bristol Bank , in London . " " Ask him what accounts the banks are acting for . " " I did . He does n't know . He 's going to try to find out , but he does n't think he can . " He paused . " I 've started doing some checkingon my own . On Lipp personally . " " Good . " He left again . Helen Doyle brought in the mail and accumulated telephone messages . There was more mail than usual but fewer telephonemessages . The slip on top , I noticed , informed me that Detective O'Brien had called and wanted me to call him back . I did . And found that both he and Sestino were out . I left word that I 'd called and dropped the slip into my wastebasket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had called and would call again . She did not want me to call her back . " Not " was underlined . I stared at the slip for a while , then tucked it under the blotter . I started for Tom 's office , to see whether he was following through , but Mark corralled me in the corridor . He was back to normal . In fact , he was worse than normal . The outfit that printed all the forms we used had raised its prices ten percent without consulting us , and he was livid . Furthermore , Tom had suggested we have the office painted , and it was n't even dirty . I heard Mark out , then went in to talk to Tom . He was following through . He was on the telephone as I came in , talking to someoneat the Bank of Northern California . I sat down and listened129to his end of the conversation . He was being his most charming self , but it was n't getting him anywhere . Finally he gave up . " No dice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . Various trust accounts , that 's all they 'd say . " " Try London . " " I will , but it 'll be the same thing there , I can assure you . " " Try . " He picked up the telephone again but after a moment put it down . " We 're both nuts , " he said . " It 's six o'clock in London . They 're closed . " " Who 'd you deal with there ? " " Sir Archibald Beardsley . " " Well , call him first thing in the morning . " " I will . It wo n't do any good , though . What 's bugging you ? " " I do n't know . I 'm just curious . I saw Lipp and Patterson togetherover the weekend . I think Amalgamated 's buying Cornputechbased on something Lipp 's been telling Patterson . And it occurred to me , maybe he 's trying to unload his own stock . " " Do n't be ridiculous . Anton Lipp could damn near buy the Bristol Bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite . Anyway , it 's worth pursuing . " " Where did you see Lipp ? " Tom asked . I told him . " I asked you to come with me , " he said . He looked hurt . " I know . But I suddenly had the feeling that I could n't stand it any longer , I had to get away . " I smiled . " What makes you think the office needs painting ? " " Because it does , damn it . " Then he smiled too . " Get lost , will you ? I 've got work to do . " I went back to my own office and was immediately buzzed by Helen . " There 're two men to see you in the reception room , " she said . " I do n't want to be disturbed . Who are they ? " " Two detectives . A Mr. O'Brien and a Mr. Sestino . " " Hell , " I said . " You 'd better show them in. " 13023The first thing O'Brien asked was where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ask how he knew I 'd been anywhere . " We had people watching your house , " he said . Not me . My house . " If I 'd known that , " I said , " I probably would n't have gone anywhere . The place was making me ner-vous . " " You went to the funeral and then you disappeared , " Sestino said , looking around at various objects in the room . He seemed as curious about the trappings of my office as he 'd been about those of my house . I guessed that his curiosity was more personal than professional ; nevertheless , I found it disconcerting . " Were you following me ? " I asked . " No , " said O'Brien . " We were at the funeral , though . " Not me . The funeral . " I did n't see you . " " We were in the back . " My house . The funeral . It made sense , in a way . They wanted to know who my contacts were . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunch but nothing to back it up : putting out antennae . " You have n't answered my question , " O'Brien said . " I was in Greenwich , Connecticut , with Mark Price . He has a house there . If your people saw me come home , they probably saw him come with me . I had n't planned to go , but after the131funeral I suddenly felt I did n't want to stay at my place . " " We 'll talk to him . In fact , we 'd like to talk to a number of people here . " " Who ? " " Anyone who can explain what Ortega was doing . " " I can do that better than anyone else . " " We 'd like to talk to others , though . " " Everybody sees things different , " Sestino added . There 'd be no harm in it . My staff was reluctant to discuss our activities even with other departments , let alone with outsiders ; if anything sensitive came up , they 'd refer the detectives right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the only other one who knew what I was up to , other than Tom and Mark , was Irving , who could handle himself just fine . Yet I was irritated . The pace in an office such as ours is generally brisk , especially on a day when the market itself is active . Anything that interrupts it is unwelcome . " All right , " I said . " The ones who can help you the most are the members of the research department . I 'll introduce you to them . " " What about other departments ? " O'Brien asked . " Did n't Ortegahave any special friends there ? " " No one in particular . You 're welcome to ask , though . " The salesmen would be annoyed as hell at having to stop what they were doing , to answer questions . " That 'll be fine , " O'Brien said . He seemed pleased . " The first one I 'll introduce you to is Irving Silvers . He 's my assistant and he 'll introduce you to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but at that moment my telephone rang . He sat down again . I lifted the instrument and said , " No calls . I 'm busy . " " It 's that Mrs. Ackroyd , " Helen said . " The one who called this morning . " I started to tell her to inform Mrs. Ackroyd that I 'd call her back , but I caught sight of the slip sticking out from under the132blotter . Most of it was hidden , but it reminded me that Mrs. Ackroyd did n't want to be called back . " O.K. , " I said . " Put her on . " " Mr. Potter , " said Mrs. Ackroyd . " Oh , I 'm so glad that I managed to get you . " " I 'm afraid you caught me at a bad moment , " I said , glancing at the detectives . " Let me call you back in a few minutes . " " Oh , dear , no . I 'm afraid you ca n't do that . I 'm calling from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vera to know . " " Then let me suggest that you call me again , later in the day . " " I 've already gone out twice . Vera wo n't know what to make of it . " " I understand , " I said , " and I do want to hear what 's on your mind , but later . I 'll be here until five at least . " And before she could protest further , I hung up . I turned to the detectives . " It 's always something , in this business . Well , come along and let me introduce you to Irving . " They got up . " By the way , " Sestino said , " being in this business , have you ever heard of Amalgamated Investors Services ? " I stopped in my tracks . " Yes , " I said cautiously . " They 're customersof ours . Why ? " " This brother-in-law of mine , he sells mutual funds and he 's been telling me I should put money with them . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , relieved . And shepherded the two of them into Irving 's office . Back at my desk , I made an attempt to forget that the detectives were around and pretty well succeeded . I told Helen to let my calls through , and they began to come in one after another . Severaltimes I went out to check the ticker tape . By one o'clock fourteen million shares had changed hands , and the averages were still up . Not as much as they 'd been during the morning , however . The feeling I 'd had  --  that the rally would n't last  --  remained with me . And presently the reason for the rally emerged . Word had leaked out that the chairman of the Senate Banking133Committee was going to make some kind of statement recommendinganother tax cut . But before he could even make the statement , the ranking minority member of the same committee issued a statement that he 'd oppose any tax cut . Which showed how nervous the market had become , since neither one of them had all that much to do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call now , while I was free , but she did n't . And I wondered what she had to tell me that she did n't want Vera to hear . Interlake stock was n't doing any more than it had been doing before , but Computech was still trading at a fast clip . It was being overshadowed , though , by Martinson Corp . Martinson 's leading product was Acidall tablets , and the Food and Drug Administrationhad just released a report which said that Acidall did n't relieve stomach acid as much as the ads claimed . A hundred and twenty thousand shares of Martinson had already changed ownership , and the price was dropping steadily . Tom burst into my office , looking rather wild-eyed . " I 've had four calls already . Everyone wants to sell Martinson . What do you think ? " " Tell them not to panic , " I said . " The excitement wo n't last , and it 's a good company . " He pulled himself together . " Those damn detectives are here . They seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ca n't you get them off my back ? " " They 're just probing . " " Well , I wish they 'd probe somewhere else . I have n't got time for them , and neither do my men . " He left . Wondering whether I 'd really given him good advice , I went out to look at the tape again . I found O'Brien and Sestino also looking at it . " What does that mean ? " Sestino asked , pointing . " That means somebody just bought three hundred shares of A.T . &T.;  --  and that 's the price . " 134 " A.T . &T.,; eh ? You think it 's a good buy ? " I made a noncommittal sound and turned to O'Brien . " Is everyonebeing helpful ? " " Everyone seems to be pretty busy . " " That 's the way it is sometimes , " I told him . Sestino pointed again . " What 's that ? " " That 's the symbol for Martinson Corporation . The company 's having a rough day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while ago that Acidall does n't do as much for you as they say in the ads . " " It sure as hell do n't , " O'Brien observed . I returned to my office . They followed me . " What was Ortega 's connection with VD ? " O'Brien asked . " Silversmentioned it , but no one seems to know exactly . " I glanced at the telephone . Do n't call now , I told Mrs. Ackroyd . " He was interviewing executives at a company that 's trying to develop a cure for a certain type of it . " " Oh . " He appeared to be disappointed . " Well , what else was he working on ? " " Did n't the boys tell you ? " " Not very much . They said we should ask you . " " He was looking into a new blood anticoagulant . There 're somepretty good ones in use now , but there 's always a danger of hemorrhaging , and this new one is supposed to reduce that . " " I see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And you ? " " Well , I follow what everyone else is doing , and of course I sort of specialize in insurance companies . " " I guess we 've got about as much as we can here , huh ? " he said to Sestino . " Looks that way , " Sestino agreed . " By the way , " I said , " do you intend to keep watching my house ? " 135 " I do n't know , " O'Brien said . " You think we should or you think we should n't ? " " I like the idea . After you left the other night , I felt kind of jumpy and I still have n't got over it . " He regarded me thoughtfully . " Well , now , " he said presently , " I would n't want to say anything that would make you any jumpier . But I think you ought to know , see , that we have some pretty good sources of information  --  all over . And what we heard is that this Arco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L.A. "  --  he took a notebook from his pocket and consulted it  --  " a week ago last Wednesday night . " I nodded . " They have an apartment , the two of them , in this building there , and they left it a week ago last Wednesday night and they have n't been back since . " " In other words , " I said , " you 're telling me that you do n't know where they are . " " That 's right , " O'Brien said . " That 's what I 'm telling you . But what I 'm also telling you is there 's as good a chance as not that since they have n't showed up in California , that they might still be here in New York . " He paused . " So I think you 're kind of right to feel jumpy . I would too if I was you . " 13624I did n't exactly fall apart after they left , but I did find it harder to concentrate . O'Brien had n't said that the Arco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he 'd said that they might be . And the fact that he 'd said it did n't make it true . He might simply have wanted to see how I 'd react . I 'd reacted satisfactorily , I thought . I 'd merely said , " Well , if they 're in New York , and your sources of information are as good as you say they are , you should n't have any trouble catching them , " and let it go at that . But now I could n't get the two hoods off my mind . Fortunately , however , matters came up which kept me from brooding . Irving had questions about the Tuesday letter , which for some reason he assumed he was going to write . Ward Carlton had matched buy and sell orders for 30,000 shares of InternationalContainer between two of our customers and wanted my opinion about Hopkins Tool , which one of them wanted to buy . Rose Nordike called to tell me what a nice party I 'd missed on Friday night and to sympathize with me over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight between Tom and Mark . The three of us disagreed constantly . We rarely fought , though . It did n't pay . We had too much at stake . And since we were , for137better or worse , stuck with one another , it was wise to get along  --  and each of us knew it . Yet at four o'clock on that particular Monday Helen rang me to say that Mr. Petacque wanted to see me in his office immediately , and when I got there I found Tom and Mark red-faced and glaring at each other . The argument had arisen over a block of forty thousand shares of Martinson Corp . which Tom had sold a short time before . Mark felt that the commission was too low  --  it was a quarter of a percent under that which we 'd agreed between us was rock bottom . Tom felt that he was justified in shaving the commission , because the customer was the Maryland Fund , the newest pearl in our necklace ; now that we finally had them , he wanted to keep them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dump Martinson , it should n't have been necessary to shave the commission . Tom insisted that there were plenty of houses that would have shaved it even more . Both of them were right . Both of them were wrong . Both of them had had a tough day . I tried to make peace and to a degree I succeeded . But not until after Mark had called Tom a chicken-shit salesman and Tom had accused Mark of being so stingy he would n't even piss . It took me a half hour to get them calmed down to the point where they could recognize the central issue , which was that what was done was done and we could n't renege . Shortly after that , both of them went home , leaving me to cope with an office force which had heard the shouting through the closed door and grown inquisitive . I managed to keep a reassuringsmile plastered on my face , and presently the interest died . Then I began to deal with a problem of my own : what I was going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carol , the problem had been presenting itself too often . God got wind of my thoughts . At five minutes to five Carol called . It was a strange conversation . She spent several minutes talk-138ing about virtually nothing . A dress she 'd seen in one of the showrooms , which was made out of copper mesh but neverthelessdid n't weigh much . A buyer from Omaha who 'd had a gall bladder attack . A cousin of hers who was getting married . After that she brought up the subject of the shooting . She 'd read about it in the newspapers . She was worried about me . The least I could have done was call to let her know that I was all right . " Frankly , " I told her , " I was kind of busy with the police and things like that . " " I suppose . But you managed to get away for a weekend , apparently . I called Saturday and Sunday , and there was no answer . " " I went up to Mark 's place in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one thing on her mind . " I heard a rumor about you today , " she said . " What kind of a rumor ? " " A not very nice rumor . " " What kind of not very nice rumor ? " " Something about you and Monica Lane . " Damn , I thought . " It 's not true , " I said . " My source was pretty good , " said Carol . " It 's not true , I tell you . " " Well , I hope not . Poor Victor has enough troubles without that . And she would n't be good for you , Brock . After all , I know you . She 's really not your type . " " Thanks for telling me . " " Do n't be angry . I really mean it , Brock . She would n't . " " O.K. , O.K.  --  she would n't . So what else is new ? " " I 'm sorry I made you angry . But it 's you I 'm thinking of . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends , Brock ? One thing has nothing to do with the other . We ought to be able to be friends at least . " " We are friends , Carol . " " Not good friends . " Another pause . " I 'm going to swallow my pride for the dozenth time and invite you to take me to Summer139Song Friday night . Someone gave me two tickets today . " I hemmed and hawed and tried to say no . But in the end I said yes . Simply because it was easier . Well , I thought afterward , why not ? I took the telephone message out from under the blotter . I glanced at my watch . It was ten minutes past five . I 'd said five o'clock . Apparently Mrs. Ackroyd had n't been able to get away from Vera . Irving appeared in the doorway . " Are you still here ? " I asked . " I 'm waiting for an overseas call . I thought that was it , but it 's for you . " " There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's phone . " I hurried through the now-empty offices to Joe Rothland 's desk , wondering why the hell the switchboard operator could n't plug in the phones , when she left , in such a way that they would n't ring all over the place . " Mr. Potter ? " said Mrs. Ackroyd . " Are you free now ? " " Yes , Mrs. Ackroyd . What was it you wanted to tell me ? " " I 'm worried , Mr. Potter . I hate to bother you , but I 'm really worried . I do n't know what Vera 's going to do about all the money . " " What money , Mrs. Ackroyd ? " " The money that they found in the box Friday . " " They found money in a box ? " " A safe-deposit box . Vera did n't even know they had the box . She 'd be furious if she knew I was telling anyone , but you 're a businessman , and maybe you 'll be able to help us . And I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the state treasurer 's office was there when she opened the box , so he knows about it . That 's why I 'm so worried . I do n't want them to think Vera did anything wrong , Mr. Potter . She 's had a good education , and I know she did n't do anything wrong and I do n't want them to think that she did . " 140 " How much money did they find , Mrs. Ackroyd ? " " Fifty thousand dollars . Hundred-dollar bills . Five hundred of them . All in neat little packages . " " I think we 'd better get together , you and I. How can you arrangeto see me ? " " Oh , dear , you 're not going to make a big fuss now , are you ? " " No , I 'm not going to make a fuss . But I think you may be right  --  Vera may be in trouble . " " Oh , dear ! " " I 'll come to Chicago . Where can you meet me ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't want to make Vera angry . " " She might have reason to thank you , in the end . " " Well , I do n't know . The grocery store , I suppose . That 's about the only place I can get away to . " " Then I 'll meet you there . Tomorrow afternoon . Where is it ? " Mrs. Ackroyd told me . And I promised to be by the jams and jellies at two o'clock 14125The store was called Valueland . It was located at one end of a small shopping center on Route 30 , about a mile from the Harringtonhouse . I arrived at ten minutes to two , having driven directly there from the airport . The drive , from the far north end of the city to the far south end , had taken as long as the flight from New York to Chicago . Jams and jellies were next to canned fruits , at the rear of the store . Mrs. Ackroyd was n't around . I began to inspect the labels on the various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at the labels I got the feeling that I really ought to spend more time studying products at the consumerlevel . For that was where the ups and downs of stocks had their origins . You could learn as much about the auto industry in a used-car lot as you could in the executive offices in Detroit . I knew this and yet I kept forgetting . I watched the shoppers as they pushed their carts down the aisle , making their decisions . They looked worried . Buying a can of peaches had become a bigger problem than anything of that sort had ever been before , and the expressions on the faces of the women selecting food was n't much different , it seemed to me , from those of mutual-fund managers as they tried to make up142their minds about the commitment of millions of dollars . But it was the women in Valueland and their husbands and their children , and the countless families like them , who would determine whether the mutual-fund managers were right or wrong . Mrs. Ackroyd came around the corner , wheeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I noticed , she 'd stopped to pick up a quart of milk and a dozen eggs . She chose a jar of orange marmalade and glanced nervously in both directions before speaking . " I almost changed my mind , " she said in a low voice . " I 'm glad you did n't , " I said . " Not so loud , " she cautioned . " The woman over there lives two houses down from Vera . " " Let 's go out to my car , " I suggested . She nodded . I waited while she went through the check-out line and led her to where the car was parked . But when we got there she was still afraid of being seen , so I pulled the car out of the lot and onto the highway , cruising toward the interstate which I 'd taken from the airport . " Now tell me exactly what happened , " I said . She 'd been clutching her bag of groceries to her bosom but presently she relaxed enough to put it on the seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do , " she said . " And neither does Vera . " " How did she discover the money ? " " It was on account of you , I think . You asked her to look for something , some sort of paper , and there was this cigar humidor on the shelf in the closet where Wesley kept things . Vera never paid any attention to it , because there was never anything of hers in it , but the day before the funeral , when you asked her about that paper , she came across the key . She showed it to me , and it looked like the key to a safe-deposit box , but it was n't the key to their regular box , and when Mr. Dakin came over Tuesday night with his wife to pay their respects at the chapel I told him about it. 143 " Who 's Mr. Dakin ? " " Their lawyer . He lives around the corner . I do n't suppose I should have stuck my nose into it , but I think sooner or later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Thursday morning Mr. Dakin remembered and he came by on his way to work and asked for the key . Vera was still asleep , but I took it upon myself to give it to him . When she got up I told her what I 'd done and that I did n't know whether I 'd done the right thing . She was kind of peeved , but she said it was all right . Well , Mr. Dakin took it to his bank , and it did n't take them any time to trace it . By noon he was on the phone saying it was the key to a safedepositbox in a bank Vera had never even heard of . It 's a little bank out in Oak Park , and how Wesley found it I 'm sure I do n't know . Vera said there must be some mistake , but Mr. Dakin said that there was n't any mistake  --  the box was in that bank , and Wesley was the one who rented it . Vera was kind of upset . So was Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him , somehow , that Wesley should have a box like that , that he 'd never mentioned to anybody , in a little out-of-the-way bank like that , and he said that the box should be opened as soon as possible . It 's kind of hard to arrange something like that , but they let you do it if you have a man from the state treasurer 's office with you , because the will might be in the box , or burial instructions , or something like that . " " I know . " " Well , Mr. Dakin made an appointment with a man from the state treasurer 's office , and on Friday we all went out to the bank . I thought I should go along , because after all I am her mother , and I felt kind of responsible , seeing as how I was the one who told Mr. Dakin in the first place . Well , after we got there I did n't feel so bad . The bank already knew that Wesley was dead and they 'd put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to go through all this rigmarole , but they finally gave us the box , and we took it into this room , with the man from the state treasurer 's office , and opened it . And there was all this money . Well , if I'd144been struck by lightning I could n't have been more surprised . And Vera too . And Mr. Dakin . Everybody was surprised . " Mrs. Ackroyd paused for breath . " How long had Wesley had the box ? " I asked . " That 's the first thing Mr. Dakin wanted to know : when Wesley rented the box and how many times he 'd used it . And that 's what Vera ca n't explain . I mean , Wesley 'd rented the box only four and a half weeks ago and he 'd never used it since . I mean , the day he rented it he must have put the money in , and he never went back after that . Vera does n't know where the money came from , or even whether it 's Wesley 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box , and now Mr. Dakin says that Vera 's going to have to pay all kinds of taxes , and it 's going to be even worse if she ca n't explain how the money got to be there . Is that true ? " " I 'm afraid so . " " Oh , dear ! " Mrs. Ackroyd put her arm around the bag of groceriesand hugged it , as if for consolation . " Is it really serious ? " " That depends on what you mean by serious , Mrs. Ackroyd . She certainly wo n't be able to touch the money for a good long while . And if nobody else claims it  --  which I guess they wo n't , considering the circumstances  --  she will have to pay taxes on it . Federal and state . Inheritance and income taxes . And the government is certainly going to ask a lot of questions in order to decide how much she owes . " " But she doens't know , Mr. Potter . She ca n't tell them what she does n't know . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the money may be legitimate savings . " Mrs. Ackroyd shook her head . " Vera says no . They used to be able to save some money , but everything 's gotten so expensive , they have n't been able to save anything in the past couple of years . It 's the same with me , so I know . And what little they were able to save is in the bank  --  I mean , in their regular bank . Vera has the passbook . " " How much was your son-in-law earning ? " 145 " I do n't know exactly . I think around eighteen thousand , but maybe it was more . When Mr. Rasher made him assistant treasurer , he got a raise . But that was n't so long ago . No , according to Vera they just were n't able to save much . " " When , exactly , did he get promoted ? " " Last Christmas . " " What happened to the man who was assistant treasurer before ? " " I do n't know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " The thing is , Mr. Potter , what should we do ? You 're a businessman , and it was on account of you that Vera found the key . " " Is that why you called me ? " Mrs. Ackroyd gave me a shrewd sideways glance . " Well , I thought that since the paper you wanted and the key were in the same place , maybe there was a connection between them . " " Maybe there is , " I said . " Have you talked to anybody else about it ? " " No . And neither has Vera . But she 's been thinking of talking to Mr. Rasher . Do you think she should ? " " No , " I said emphatically . " That would be a mistake . " She gave me another sideways glance , but said nothing . I wondered whether I 'd made the point strongly enough . " Avery serious mistake , " I said . " She should let Mr. Dakin handleit , and not tell anyone else . You either . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the car into a gas station , turned it around and we headed back to the shopping center . " I never did like Wesley Harrington , " Mrs. Ackroyd said after a moment . " I did n't want Vera to marry him . She would n't lis-ten . " I looked at her . " But I never thought he was dishonest , " she added . " And now you do ? " I asked 146 " He must have been . " She paused to consider what she 'd said . And decided that she was right . " Yes , he definitely must have been . " I offered no opinion . But it seemed to me that she was seeing things pretty clearly. 14726I dropped Mrs. Ackroyd off at Valueland and went back to the interstate . It was two-thirty . On the remainder of the ride she 'd told me only one other fact that seemed important : before going to work for Interlake , WesleyHarrington had been employed by the Federal Reserve Bank in Boston . As an assistant bank examiner . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once before . Then I walked one block down Michigan Avenue to Delaware Place and checked into the Whitehall . At the Drake I used my right name , at the Whitehall I did n't . Which created a problem . I could n't show the room clerk at the Whitehall a credit card , and he did n't want to let me in without one . He finally agreed to accept a cash deposit  --  two hundred dollars for two nights ; anythingleft over would be returned to me . But that was all the cash I had . From my room in the Drake I called Philip Quick . I 'd chosen his name from the various listings in the Yellow Pages . I 'd never hired a private detective before and was surprised to find five pages of the telephone directory devoted to them . Apparently the detective business was good in Chicago . Some of the agencies had large ads , explaining the things they did . I passed those up and selected Quick , because all that was given were his name , address and telephone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his name ; it expressed my state of mind  --  I was in a hurry . The woman who answered the telephone said that Mr. Quick was out but would call me back shortly . I waited , and after ten minutes he did . I told him who I was , where I was and that I had some work I wanted him to do . He asked what kind of work it was . I said I 'd prefer to discuss that in person . He agreed to come to the hotel . " How soon can we get together ? " I asked . " I can probably be there in half an hour , " he said . He had a gravelly voice . " Fine , " I said . " Half an hour . " And hung up . He could n't have been far away , however , for he was at my door in less than twenty minutes . I almost changed my mind when I met him . He looked less like a detective than anyone I 'd ever seen . About @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fitted my image of a gambler on a winning streak . Red and black plaid jacket , black slacks , black and white sports shirt , Gucci loafers , thousand-dollar gold wrist watch , diamond-and-rubyring . Moreover , I 'd thought that a private detectivewould be a quiet , taciturn man , and Quick was just the opposite . He was a compulsive talker . I told him what I wanted him to do , and he said it would be no problem . Then he launched into a fifteen-minute explanation of himself and his career . He 'd been on the police force for fourteen years , moonlighting with private cases . His position in the police department made it possible for him to accomplish more for outside clients than he would have been able to do otherwise , and for that reason he 'd resigned from the force with great reluctance ; besides , he 'd hated to give up his pension . But his private cases had been taking up too much of his time , and of course they were more profitable . Now that he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money working on his own as he could in the police department . He rarely took cases that came in off149the street , preferring clients who were sent to him by lawyers , but he would take my case , because it was such a simple one and because he happened to be in the neighborhood . He talked on and on , in that irritating voice , telling me how good he was and how in his entire career he 'd never failed to accomplish what the client wanted , indicating at every opportunitythat he liked expensive things and could afford them . I was completely turned off by him , but it was getting late . " The office closes at five o'clock , " I said , glancing at my watch , " and it 's twenty minutes to five now . Do n't you think you should get go-ing ? " He shrugged . " Do n't worry . Leave everything to me . " He looked at his own watch , holding his wrist in such a way that I could n't fail to notice the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . Now let me get this straight . The man 's name is Malcolm Davis , and he 's in the auditing department , and you want to meet him in a way that looks accidental . " " Right . I 'm not positive that he 's in the auditing department , but I believe he is , and that he 's fairly high up in it . But I 'm sure you 'll be able to find him , once you get over there . If not , he 'll probably be at home sometime this evening . I gave you his address  --  that 's as much as I can give you . He 's a big man , with  --  " " I know , I know , " Quick said impatiently . " It does n't matter . I 'll find him . Leave everything to me . " " He 's a heavy drinker , so there 's a pretty good chance that he 'll lead you to a bar someplace , which would be fine . " " Sure , sure . Leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd like to meet him as soon as possible . " " Do n't worry . Now where shall I send my bill ? " " First get me together with Davis , then let 's talk about the bill . " " I 'll get you together with Davis . I 've never failed a client yet . But I have to know where to send the bill . Five hundred dollars is my minimum fee . Plus expenses , of course . Now give me your address . " 150I gave him a business card , and he left . I was thoroughly annoyed . The Interlake Building was n't far from the hotel , but I doubted that Quick could get there before closing time . Yet if he had n't talked so much , he could have done it . Furthermore , five hundred dollars was a hell of a lot of money for what I wanted him to do . I went down to the lobby and cashed a check , since the Whitehallhad left me with only five dollars . Then I returned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tie and ordered a double martini . Quick had promised to call me as soon as he was on the trail , and I guessed that I was going to have a long wait. 15127I 'd told Irving where I was going . It would be all right to share the information with Tom and Mark , I 'd said , but no one else . But even he did n't know what hotel I was staying at , and I thought I 'd better let him know . He was at home , having dinner . The weekly letter had gone out , he assured me , although he 'd had to make some last-minute changes , because the market had gone down more today than it had gone up yesterday and there was a rumor that interest rates were again going to be increased . " Anything else ? " I asked . " Tom and Mark seem kind of mad at each other . " " They 'll get over it . What else ? " " Harriet called . She wanted to talk to you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give me . Just said she 's at the Statler in Washington . " " O.K. , I 'll call her . And for your ears only I 'm at the Drake in Chicago . Room 809 . " " Right . How long will you be there ? " " I do n't know , Irv . Another day or so , maybe . " " I 've still got those dates in Detroit . I said I 'd be there this Thursday . I do n't think I ought to change them again  --  it 'd look funny . " 152 " I forgot about that . Well , we may have to bend the rules . I 'll try to be back by then , but if I 'm not , go anyway . Can you get everything done there in a day ? " " I think so . " " Good . " " Oh , and , Brock  --  that cop called . O'Brien . He wanted to know where you were . I said I did n't know but I do n't think he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought about it for a moment . Honesty was the best policy . " Well , if he calls again , tell him that you heard from me , and where I am . Tell him that I came out here for a couple of days on business . " " What about Tom and Mark ? Shall I tell them ? " " Only if they ask . They may not . " " Tom did . He wanted to talk to you . " " Well , all right . I 'll call him . Anything else I should know ? " " Yes . We were having dinner , and mine is getting cold . " " O.K. , so eat . " I hung up and went back to what was left of mymartini . Then I picked up the telephone again . Possibly Harrietwas in her room . She was . Having a martini , she said . " That makes two of us , " I told her . " Only mine 's a double . " " Mr. Price does n't question your expense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Irving said you were out of town . " " I 'm in Chicago again . " " Oh . Something new happen ? " " Yes . But what about you ? " " Well , I talked to Uncle Bill . It 's awfully hard to get anything out of the FBI , he says . But he sent me to Senator Watkins . He said if anybody can do it Watkins can  --  he 's on the AppropriationsCommittee . The senator did n't seem very enthused , but while I was with him he got a call from Uncle Bill , and that helped . He was going to talk to someone at the Justice Departmentand let me know . Do you want me to stay here and wait ? " 153 " How long do you think it 'll take ? " " A day or two , he said . " " Then I think you 'd better stay there , Harriet . In case he ca n't , you may have to see someone else . " " I would n't know who , Brock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any event I 'd stay on the spot if I were you. , , " All right . Where can I reach you if I find out anything ? " " I 'm unreachable at the moment . Leave word with Irving . " " Tell him everything ? " " Use your own judgment . " On that note , and with an exchange of good wishes , we ended the call . I tried to get Tom . I did n't succeed . His son answered the telephone . Tom and his wife had gone out for the evening . All I learned was that Tom 's son was unhappy at the prospect of having to go back to school . I ordered dinner from room service . I 'd had an early lunch on the plane , and nothing since . It took a long while for the meal to arrive . I passed the interval watching television . Three young policemen were trying to catch a mad killer . None of the policemen resembled O'Brien or Sestinoor any other policeman I 'd ever seen . They looked like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another was enormous . What 's more , all of them were exceptionally good at climbing , running and leaping from ledges . The mad killer turned out to be a former policeman . In the end he got shot and fell off a fire escape . At eight o'clock the waiters finally wheeled the table into my room , and I began to eat . I wondered whether I 'd have to spend the night at the Drake . I was safe enough there , I supposed . Yet I 'd feel better staying where I was registered under the fictitious name . I should have arranged with Quick for him to report back to me at fixed intervals . I 'd been in too much of a hurry . And too154irritated . The man was so damned egocentric . Other private detectiveswere n't like that . Or were they ? In the past I 'd always been my own detective . It was better that way . But on the spur of the moment hiring a stranger had seemed like a good idea . As a matter of fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though . A new program was under way . A very rich woman had disappearedfrom her house on the French Riviera . Her nephew was attempting to trace her . I never got to find out whether he did or not . Or to finish my meal either . For at eight-fifteen the telephone rang . Malcolm Davis was at a bar called the Pillbox , on North SheridanRoad , Quick informed me ; I should come right over. 1552sFrom the outside it did n't appear to be much of a place . It was one of three stores on the ground floor of an old high-rise apartmentbuilding . The others were a real estate office and a beauty shop . A small , crackling pink-neon sign said " PILLBOX . " The show window had been painted black , but there was a small clear square in the middle , with a Hamm 's beer sign . I took a deep breath and opened the door . The room was quite dark . A long bar occupied the left side , a row of semicircular booths the right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jukebox in the back . An illuminated sign near the jukebox said " REST ROOMS . " One of the tables was occupied , and there were half a dozen customers scattered along the bar . With the exception of two men , all the bar customers were sitting by themselves . The two men were Malcolm Davis and Philip Quick . They were engaged in a heated discussion . I stood there a moment , adjusting . I had n't expected Quick to be present . Davis had his head turned away from the door and did n't see me , but Quick was looking straight at me . He gave no sign of recognition , however . I walked over to them and sat down on the stool next to Davis 's . " It 's the goddamn line , " he was saying . " They 're not strong enough to protect the backfield . That 's the whole trouble . " " That 's the fault of management , " Quick told him. 156 " They 're like a bunch of goddamn high-school players , " Davis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came over to me . He had the build of a football player and the face of a man who 'd never in his entire life liked anyone . " Beer , " I said . He filled a mug from the tap . " Ten years ago they were n't like that , " Davis said . " Ten years ago they did n't have all the competition , " the bartenderbutted in . " That 's the trouble . It 's not that they 've gotten so worse , it 's that everyone else 's gotten better . " He gave me my beer . " That 's management , " Quick said . " Too greedy . They wo n't pay enough . " The bartender nodded . I looked at the hand-lettered sign over the cash register . " NO CHECKS CASHED , " it said . My eyes were getting used to the dim light . Davis was drinking something clear that had a slice of lime in it . He 'd almost finished it . Quick was working his way through a beer . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Too many teams . " He picked up his glass and finished the drink , then handed his glass to the bartender . " And give my friend another beer , " he instructed him . Quick shook his head . " Thanks , but I 've got to be going . Promisedthe wife I 'd be home . " " One more , " Davis urged . " Another time , " Quick said . He finished the beer , put the glass down noisily and got off the stool . He patted Davis on the shoulder . " Nice talking to you . " " Sure I ca n't buy you another ? " Davis asked . He sounded disappointed . Quick glanced at me , again without recognition , wished Davis good luck and left . " Nice guy , " Davis observed to the bartender. 157 " Nice ring he was wearing , " the bartender replied . Davis turned and saw me . He frowned , as if he knew he 'd seen me someplace before but could n't remember where . I smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave him the new drink he ignored it . " Hi , " I said . It came to him . There was a flicker of shock on his face , then nothing . " I 'm Brock Potter , " I said . He nodded slowly . " It 's a small world . " He did nothing . Just sat there , looking me in the eye . " Jerry ! " someone down the bar called . The bartender went over to him . Davis suddenly put one foot on the floor , as if he intended to leave . " Do n't go , " I said , taking his arm . " I have some interesting news for you . " He hesitated . He seemed afraid to leave and afraid to stay . " Look , " I said , " let 's level with each other . I know you 're the one who called me in New York . I have a recorder on my telephone , and a voice-print device would identify your voice in a minute . " It sounded good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want ? " " To start with , I want to know why you called . " " I was doing a favor for a friend . " " Wesley Harrington ? " He would n't commit himself . " There 's no point in not telling me , " I said . " I 've got the list . You know that . And Harrington is dead . " He remained silent . " You 're not doing yourself any good by clamming up . I could take the record of those telephone calls to the Insurance Commissionand to the police , and you 'd have to answer their questions whether you want to or not . " 158 " Go ahead . " He was scared , though . I could see it . " All right , I will . " I started to get up . " Wait a minute , " he said quickly . He picked up his drink . " Come over here . " He led me to a booth at the back of the room . " Harrington thought he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seated . " I do n't know what it was . That 's the truth . " " You know what you said . Or what he told you to say . That 's enough . " " I do n't know what he was trying to pull . Believe me . " " Believe you ? How can I ? You 're not that dumb . You 've got a responsible job in a big company . You did n't get there because you were stupid . " " Wes was my friend . I wanted to help him . " " You 're not that stupid either . You knew damn well you could lose your job , at the very least . " " What the fuck difference does it make ? I 've lost everything else . " " Who was supposed to meet me at the Astor Tower  --  Harringtonor you ? " " Harrington . " " And what were you going to get out of it ? " " Nothing . I was doing Wes a favor , I tell you . Who the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I wish I would get fired . " " I do n't believe that you were n't going to get anything out of it . Money changed hands . Harrington 's widow has found a bundle of cash she ca n't explain . " " No ! " " Yes . It 's no secret . The state treasurer 's office knows about the money . The state and federal revenue services will be told automatically . Questions are going to be asked . " " That has nothing to do with me . It was Harrington 's money , not mine . " 159 " But you helped him get it . " " I did not ! Leave me alone , damn it ! " His voice rose . Two of the men at the bar turned around . The bartender came out from behind the bar and walked over to us . " Everything all right ? " he asked Davis . " Everything 's all right , Jerry , " Davis assured him . " Everything'sall right . " After a moment the bartender went back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of here , " Davis told me . " I could get you thrown into jail , " I replied . " I did n't do anything wrong . I did n't break any laws . It was Harrington . " " What laws did Harrington break ? " " I do n't know . But I know that I did n't break any . " " How much does Rasher know ? " There was a silence . " Rasher ? " Davis asked finally . " Rasher . How much does he know ? He 's the one who put Harringtonwhere he was , was n't he ? " " Rasher liked him . Rasher hired him . Yes , Rasher made him his assistant . But how should I know how much Rasher knows ? Ask Rasher . " " And tell him about you ? " " Oh , God ! " " And Lipp  --  shall I tell him about you too ? " " Oh , God ! Leave me alone ! Leave me alone ! " You could hear him all over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on here ? " " This guy wo n't get off my back , " Davis said . " Get him out of here , Jerry . " The bartender took me by the arm and pulled me from the booth . " The beer is on the house , buddy . Come on . " He hustled me to the front of the room , opened the front door and gave me a push . I staggered across the sidewalk and bumped into a lamppost . For the first time in my life I 'd been thrown out of a bar. 16029Eight-thirty was too early , Quick said . How about nine-thirty ? Nine-thirty would be O.K. , I said , adding , " I 'm not at the Drake . I 'm at the Whitehall . Room 2005 . " " Oh ? " I did n't explain . He arrived at a quarter to ten . With bloodshot eyes . He 'd been up most of the night , he said , following someone 's straying wife . She was having an affair with a clarinet player , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the morning . Then he paused . " How come you changed hotels ? " " Business reasons , " I replied . " And registered under another name ? " " You know about that ? " " I asked for you at the desk . " " Business reasons , " I said again . But since he did n't look satisfied , I went a step further . " The card I gave you yesterday is authentic . I 'm a stockbroker . I 'm in the analysis end of the business , though . I 'm here investigating Interlake . It 's better if they do n't know where to find me . You can call my office if you do n't believe me . " He still seemed skeptical . I showed him credit cards , driver 's license and a sample of my signature . " All right , " he said finally . " What can I do for you now ? " 161 " You did a good job last night , " I said . " You got me to Davis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always do a good job . That 's how I got my reputation . Never disappoint a client . " " How 'd you do it ? " " That 's another thing I never do : explain my methods . " " Did you get onto him at the office or when he left his apart-ment ? " " I did n't even go to the office . I went right to his apartment . " He smiled . " Let 's just say I knew he was going to have some pizza and go to the Pillbox . " I thought about it . The only way Quick could have learned such things so quickly was by bugging Davis 's apartment and eavesdroppingon a conversation . Which was illegal . I did n't pursue the matter . " I did n't expect to find you talking to him , " I said . " Why not ? It was a way of keeping him there . And I like to talk to people . You never know what they 're going to say . People are interesting . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet a lot of people . " He launched into another long explanation of himself . This time I paid attention , however . My opinion of him had gone up . " What do you think of Davis ? " I asked when he finished . He shrugged . " Frustrated . One of those ex-jock types who finds things falling apart . Football player . College , not pro . Wanted to turn pro but either was n't good enough or changed his mind when he got married . That 's why he goes to a joint like the Pillbox . The bartender used to be a pro football player , until he wrecked his knee . The two of them like to talk football . And I 'd say Davis has more time on his hands right now than he knows what to do with . His wife left him not so long ago . Went off with somebody else . He 's bitter as hell about that . She took the kids , the furniture , tied up the bank account  --  he got kind of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd say , and he bought this new condominium , thinking that that might help , and no sooner162did he buy it than she up and left . Now nothing seems any good to him . That 's my impression , at any rate . He 's a man does n't care what happens to him . " I nodded . That seemed a pretty good summary . Especially since he could n't have talked to Davis for more than half an hour . My estimate of him went up another couple of notches . " Would you say he was dishonest ? " " Could be , " Quick replied thoughtfully . " A man like that , you do n't know . I 'd say he was n't originally , but when a man does n't care anymore  --  well , he can go either way . That 's been my expe-rience . " " Mine too , " I said . " Now about today  --  I 've got another job for you . Same kind . I want to bump into a man named Richard Rasher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think he 'll lead you to a bar , but he 'll probably lead you to a restaurant . I 'd like to meet him where he 's having lunch . " " I do n't know , " Quick said . " I 've got a tough day ahead . I 've got a lot of jobs going . I 've got to get this ring back for a client  --  she knows who 's got it and she ca n't report him to the police . Then there 's this guy who 's screwing around with his wife 's sister . And I have a fitting on some jackets I bought . You like cashmere ? Anyway , I 'm going to be tied up . But maybe I can squeeze in an hour or so . What time does this Rasher eat ? " " I do n't know . You mean you have all these jobs going at one time and you handle them all yourself ? " " Sure . How else could I make my kind of money ? You put on extra people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And most of the guys around in this business are such a bunch of clowns I would n't even want to hire them . Me , I put in an hour here , a couple hours there . Most jobs are n't that hard , and with the kind of equipment we got nowadays you do n't have to spend a lot of time . All that stuff about detectives working on one case day and night  --  it hardly ever happens like that . " He reached for the telephone , dialed Information and asked163for the number of Interlake General Insurance Company . Then he hung up and dialed again . " I 'd like to speak to Richard Rasher , " he said . Then he said it again , apparently to Rasher 's secretary . " No , personal , " he added . " I 'm with the Insurance Commission in California and I 'm in town and I thought maybe we could have lunch together . I 'm not doing anything around one o'clock , and if he 's free . . . I see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , I wo n't bother him . Thanks anyway . " He hung up . " It wo n't work , " he said to me . " He 's home , sick . " We looked in the telephone directory . Rasher was listed . He lived on Lincoln Park West . We discussed it . There was no way , we decided , that I could meet Rasher accidentally . I 'd have to go to his home and hope that he 'd let me in . But if he really was sick , he probably would n't . " And if that 's the case , " Quick said , " let me know . I 'll find out for you what 's going on inside . " " How ? " He smiled . " Leave that to me . I 've never disappointed a client yet . " " Any messages for 809 ? " I asked . " Yes , there are , " said the message clerk . Tom had called . So had O'Brien . Both of them wanted me to call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it up again . Tom was out . I tried O'Brien . He was in . And annoyed . I should have told him I was leaving town , he said . I explained that I had to carry on with my work and that I had some appointments in Chicago . He did n't care what I had to do , he said ; he wanted me to tell him when I went out of town ; he wanted to know where I was so164that he could get in touch with me on short notice if he had to . I apologized . He asked when I 'd be back in New York , and I said I 'd probably be there the next day . He asked whether he could reach me at the Drake in the meanwhile , and I said that he could . He instructed me to let him know as soon as I landed in New York . I promised to do so . I hung up and went to the window . From my room in the Whitehall I could see my room in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought my car . He explained how to get to LincolnPark West . It was n't far . The building was a nice one . A stately three-story walk-up with bay windows and fancy cornices , facing the park . The sort of building which would probably be torn down within the next few years and replaced by a high-rise that would accommodate two hundred families instead of three . I sat in the car for a few minutes , planning what I was going to say . All I could do was what I 'd done with Davis : apply pressure . Rasher , it seemed to me , was the type who did n't stand up well under pressure . I climbed out of the car and went into the lobby . It was a spacious area with a red tile floor and a glass door that separated the outer lobby from an inner one . The stairway leading up to the apartments from the inner lobby was carpeted , and in addition there was a small automatic elevator . I tried the glass door . It was locked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle one . I started to push the button above it , then hesitated . Was I really making the right move ? Suddenly I was n't sure . I might accomplishmore by letting Quick use his methods . But I 'd lose a day . A woman came into the lobby . A stout woman , middle-aged . Over her arm she was carrying a man 's suit in a plastic cleaning bag . Mrs. Rasher ? Quite possibly . I smiled at her and left. 165I walked to the end of the building and followed the driveway that ran along the side of it to the garages in the back . Toward the rear of the building was a door . It was n't locked . I went inside and found myself in a small vestibule with a stairway . I climbed half a flight , changed my mind and came down . This is ridiculous , I thought . Either go in the front way or leave . I returned to the lobby but still could n't make up my mind . And while I was standing there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass door into the inner lobby . A red light was glowing from the instrument panel beside the elevator . Someone was coming down . I went outside again and got into my car . A man and a woman emerged from the building . I looked at them , then quickly turned my head . They were Malcolm Davis and Vera Harrington . I slid down in the seat and stayed like that for several minutes . When I came up they were gone . I went into the lobby and pushed the button. 16630A garbled voice came through the speaking tube . It asked who I was . I answered . The glass door buzzed . I opened it , crossed the inner lobby and went up the steps . The door on the second floor was open . Rasher was standing with his hand on the knob . " I 've been expecting you , " he said , and stood aside to let me in . " They said at the office that you were sick . " " I am . Are you the insurance commissioner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " No . " He looked healthy enough . But green slacks and a green and white sports shirt emphasized the width of his hips . I was reminded of a distorted hourglass . " It 's nothing serious , I hope . " " You 're not ? " A frown creased his brow , then vanished . " Well , no matter . Serious ? Not if I take care of myself . I have to take care of myself . High blood pressure . Every now and then it shoots up , you know . " He led me into the living room , which was large and had a high ceiling . The view of the park from the bay window was very nice . Rasher fitted himself into a lounge chair and motioned for me to sit on the sofa . " I 've heard you 're a persistent man , and you certainly are , are n't you ? I must say , I 'm rather impressed . " 167 " Thank you . " " How you managed to encounter Davis in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know . He thinks you were having him followed . Were you ? " " I never discuss my methods , " I said , borrowing a phrase from Quick . " Well , no matter . What do you want this time , Mr. Potter ? Anotherlook in the vault ? " " No . One look in the vault was enough . Information is what I want , Rasher . Just information . " " Rasher ? Come now . Either make it Mr. Rasher or Dick . We 're not enemies , you know . " He smiled . " Or are we ? " " O.K. , Dick . " He was more likable when Lipp was n't around , I decided . " That 's better . I also understand that my assistant left a bit of an estate . " " Fifty thousand dollars . In hundred-dollar bills . " " Incredible . We 're all surprised . Including his widow . He was n't earning that kind of money , of course . " " I did n't think so . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't explain how you happened to find out . She thinks you must have found out either from her lawyer or from her mother . " " You know how it is , Dick . News travels . " " Apparently . At any rate , Vera 's admitted giving you the list of bonds which were allegedly stolen . " I nodded . " But of course that does n't explain the fifty thousand dollars , does it ? " I shook my head . " Well , the fact of the matter is , I ca n't explain the fifty thousand dollars any more than you can . " " What about Harrington 's murder ? " I asked . Rasher took a cigar from a box on the table beside his chair. 168He bit off one end and put a match to the other . " Should you be smoking ? " I asked . He sighed heavily . " No . But a man has to do something . I ca n't eat . I 'm on this absurd diet . Life is no fun at all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , that 's an interesting point , is n't it ? Fifty thousand dollars , then a gunman hiding in the garage . It 's possible that the gunman was after the fifty thousand dollars , would n't you say ? " I shook my head . " You would n't ? " " No . Harrington was killed because of something he knew . " " You insist on that ? " " Dick , I do n't want to fence with you . Harrington had a list of bonds which were supposedly stolen from Interlake . He wanted me to make it public . He was killed to keep him from getting together with me . It 's as simple as that . And someone tried to kill me last week , too . " Rasher chuckled , and his chins quivered . " It 's easy to understand , the way you operate , that someone would want to kill you . You 're very annoying . " His expression became serious . " Forgive me . That was n't funny , was it ? " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd seen with the cleaning bag . " I thought I smelled smoke , " she said severely . " Richard , put that cigar out . At once . " Rasher jumped . He put the cigar out . I felt sorry for him . Caught between Lipp and a woman witha voice like that  --  no wonder he had high blood pressure . " My wife , " Rasher said . " Brockton Potter , my dear . " Mrs. Rasher gave me a brief nod . " I saw Mr. Potter downstairs . " She turned and left the room . Rasher gazed fondly at the cigar , but did n't relight it . " I 'm afraid I was wrong about Harrington , " he said presently . " I trusted him . " I said nothing. 169 " I brought him into the company , you know . Promoted him . Made him my assistant . I do n't know how I could have been so wrong . " " Where did you find him ? " " In New England . He was working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Me ? I was comptroller for a company that made bedsheets , in a little town in southern Maine . It was like being buried alive up there . " " How did you get to Interlake ? " " Anton Lipp bought the company I was working for . We met . He liked me . " " So he brought you to Chicago . " " Thank God . I was miserable up there . Small towns are n't for me . " " He brought you , and you brought Harrington . " " In effect . I 'd known Harrington for a number of years . He used to travel in Maine , auditing banks . I was impressed by him . He had a good head on his shoulders . But evidently Chicago did n't agree with him morally . Or else I promoted him too fast . At any rate , something must have gone wrong . " " What about Davis ? " " Malcolm ? Malcolm was with Interlake before . Did n't you ever meet him ? " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telephone calls . " Well , I do n't suppose you would have . He 's a good man too . Or at least he was . He 's having personal problems now , and I think that 's affecting him . He 's drinking more than he should . I do n't quite know what to do about him . I keep hoping he 'll straighten out . " " He and Harrington were friends , I understand . " " Yes . And Harrington was probably a bad influence on him . " " Or vice versa. " 170tRasher shook his head . " No . If anyone did anything wrong , it was Harrington . I realize that now . I should have realized it before . I think he was exposed to too much . " " I do n't understand . " " He was a bank examiner . You 'd be surprised at some of the things bank examiners run across . Harrington was exposed to all sorts of fraud and embezzlement . He may have picked up a few ideas of his own . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . ? " " I 'm not suggesting anything . But he evidently got fifty thousand dollars recently , and I very much doubt that he did it legitimately . I 'm as anxious as you are to find out what he was up to , because it 's a reflection on me . Therefore I 'm saying you ought to look into his past . His boss at the Federal Reserve was a man named Jack Williams . If I were you , I 'd have a talk with him . He may be able to tell you some of the irregularities Harrington uncovered , and that could be useful to you . I have a hunch that he may have been doing himself what he 'd found others guilty of doing . Or else he was blackmailing someone . " " That could be . " " I 'm glad you think so . I 've never met Williams myself , but Harrington used to speak of him , and I know he 's still there . He 's one of the examiners . I do n't think he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you talk to him in person and show him your credentials he probably will . " " Thanks for the tip . I may do just that . " I smiled . " You 're being more helpful than I expected . " " I have no reason not to be . Contrary to what you may think , I too want the truth . I brought Harrington into the company . I promoted him . I feel responsible for his actions . The only thing I ask is that you do n't tell Mr. Lipp about this meeting . He 's a peculiar man . He can be one of the nicest people you ever want to meet , when things are going well . But when they 're not , he does n't like people to know . Which is understandable , of course. 171And I 'm sure he 'd prefer everyone to forget about this little episode . The fact that I 'm talking to you as I am  --  well , as he said himself , he 's mercurial . " " Mercurial ? That 's one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has a vicious temper . " " Call it what you will , but I 'm not anxious to make him angry . " " I do n't blame you . " " I hope not . For just as Harrington was indebted to me , I 'm indebted to Anton Lipp . Everything I have I owe to that man . If it were n't for him I 'd still be holed up in an ugly little dump of a mill town where the temperature goes down to twenty below zero in the winter and the snow drifts up to the eaves of the house and there 's no place to go and nothing to do and no one to talk to , and where I was working for peanuts , and where my wife and I were driving each other crazy . I try to be a realist , Mr. Potter . I try not to kid myself . I know I 'm not a particularly attractive man , and I 'm not the smartest man in the world either . I 'm pretty good with figures , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's no end to the number of men Mr. Lipp might have given a break to , but he chose me . He took me out of that rut I was in and brought me to a city where for the first time in twenty years I 'm happy and put me in a job where I amount to something and made it possible for me to earn a decent salary and have nice things like this apartment . Yes , sir , my friend , I 'm very much indebted to Anton Lipp and I do n't care what kind of a temper he has : I do n't want anything to spoil my relationship with him or threaten what I have . Can you understand that ? " " Yes . " " Then you will be discreet ? " " Yes . " " Good . Now , if you do n't mind , I 'm getting a headache . " I stood up . " I 'll let you know what Williams says . " Rasher nodded absent-mindedly . He remained seated . He suddenlyseemed very tired. 172I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd said sounded logical to me . But some of it did . And when I got back to the hotel I placed a call to Jack Williams. 17331 " Unfortunately , " said Dr. Chang , " I 'm tied up this evening , but how about having lunch with me tomorrow ? I 'd like to show you my shop and the site I 've picked for the new plant . " Which was what I 'd had in mind . " I 'd like to see them , " I said . " Good . Where are you staying ? " " At the Ritz . " " How about if I pick you up there at twelve-thirty ? " " Fine . " My appointment with Williams was at ten . Chang apologized again for being unable to take me to dinner , and we hung up . I went to the window . There are larger parks than Boston 's Public Garden , but I 've never found one that 's prettier . It was dusk . The shadows of the vast elms were long . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the distance , on Beacon Hill , the gold dome of the capitol glittered in the last of the day 's sunlight . I watched one of the swan boats being pedaled slowly around the lagoon . For a moment nothing seemed urgent . Or even important . The moment ended . I went back to the telephone and called Tom . " Where the hell are you ? " he said . " I called you at the Drake this afternoon , and they said you 'd checked out . " I told him where I was . And explained why . " Sounds like a waste of time to me , " he said. 1747 " Could be , " I agreed . " I thought it 'd be worth a try , though , as long as Williams does n't object to talking to me . " " When will you be home ? " " I 'm not sure . I have a date with Chang tomorrow afternoon . Since I 'm in town , I thought , it would n't hurt to  --  " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Who with ? " " Sir Archibald Beardsley . " " You talked to him ? " " Yes . And he 's on his way over here . Coming in tomorrow , on his way to Washington . " " Did he tell you who the bank was acting for ? " " No . But from the way he spoke , I have the feeling that he might . He said we could discuss it when he got here . I fixed it up for the two of us to get together with him . That 's what I wanted to tell you . " " I 'll be there . " " O.K. So what 's with Chicago ? " " I 'm almost positive now that there really was a theft . All I need is enough proof so that I can ring the alarm bell . I 'm hoping that Williams can point me in the right direction . " " Well , be careful . And I 'll see you Friday at one at the St. Regis , if not before . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O'Brien . No point in antagonizing him further . But both he and Sestino were off duty . I left word as to my whereabouts . And decided to do the same with Irving . He too had been trying to reach me in Chicago . He 'd had a difficult afternoon . Calls had been coming in from customers as a result of the Tuesday letter , which most of them had just received . We 'd taken Frankfurt Industries off our buy list , and the research department of Laird &; West was contradicting us by recommending it . Those who did business with both of us were confused . Even the Wall Street Journal wanted an explanation. 175 " Stick to your guns , " I said . " I have been , but it 's been tough . " " Have you heard from Harriet ? I told her to talk to you if she could n't locate me . " " That 's why I was trying to find you , Brock . She called in about an hour ago . She says she has information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My pulse quickened . " Where is she , Irv ? " " She said to tell you she is n't in Washington any longer . She 's in Bangor , Maine . " He paused . " Is she in some kind of trouble , Brock ? " " I hope not . Why ? " " Because she said she was calling from the police station . " " No , no . It 's all right . What else did she say ? " " She said you were right about Jars . She said she was about to leave the police station . She 's going to call me again at nine o'clock , in case I heard from you in the meantime . " " Great . I think we 're finally getting someplace . Tell her to call me here at the Ritz in Boston tonight . " " O.K. " He paused . " It maybe premature to mention this , Brock , but I think you should know . I 've been checking around . I have n't heard anything about Interlake or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Someone said he was fooling around over in London a few months ago . " " Fooling around ? " " Silver futures . It 's only a rumor , though . " " Thanks , Irv . Thanks very much . " We hung up , and I ordered dinner from room service . Then I settled down to wait for Harriet 's call . Silver futures . The Bristol Bank . John Patterson . And somewhereup in Maine a man named Clifford Jars . The pieces were falling into place. 17632Harriet may have been excited before but she was n't now . In fact , she was discouraged . " I 'm up against a stone wall , " she declared . " What happened ? " " It 's terribly difficult to get anything out of the FBI , Brock . They just wo n't give . As a special favor  --  well , anyway , they do have something on Clifford Jars . Not Yars  --  Jars . He was part of a counterfeiting ring that was operating up here in Bangor about eight years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them were caught , except Jars . He got away . The FBI is still looking for him , they say  --  although I imagine they 've sort of lost interest by now . At any rate , I learned that much and on the strength of it I flew up here this afternoon . " " Good girl . " " The FBI has an office here too , but it 's just a little one , and nobody there would talk , so I went to the police . I thought they might have been in on the case  --  and they were . But they would n't tell me anything either . Officially , at least . " " Damn . " " It is n't as bad as all that . One of the men I talked to seemed to like me . He gave me the name of someone he said might know something . A policeman who was on the force then and who was on the case but who 's retired now . I went to see him . He was very177nice . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that much , but he did tell me that Jars had a daughter and that she still lives here , so I went to see her  --  and that 's where I ran up against the stone wall . She says her father is dead . She says he 's been dead for years . " " I do n't believe it . " " You 'd believe it even less if you talked to her , as I just did . I was at her house less than an hour ago . I 'm positive that she 's lying . I could n't budge her , though , and finally she threw me out . Bodily , almost . " " You think she knows where her father is ? " " That 's my feeling . " " Then you 've got to keep trying , Harriet . " " I 'll do anything you say , Brock , but I 'm on the scene and you 're not , and I tell you that I can stay here for a month and try three times a day and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman . " I tried to think of an alternative course . I could n't . " Maybe if I talked to her ... " " You 're welcome to have a go at it . And I 'll make another attempt myself . But my guess is that Geraldine Jars has been standing off the FBI and Lord knows who else for eight years and she 's going to keep right on doing it . " " Where are you ? " " At the Holiday Inn . It 's just outside of town . " " Stay there . I 'll be in touch with you sometime tomorrow . I have a date in the morning with someone at the Federal Reserve who may be of some help . " " All right . " We talked for a few more minutes and then hung up . I began to pace the floor . How important was it to locate Clifford Jars ? If it could be proved that the bonds were counterfeit , the identity of the counterfeiter was incidental  --  the fact that they were counterfeit was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only temporarily . Suppose the real bonds had been used as collateral for a loan and counterfeit bonds substituted , to deceive the auditors , until the loan was repaid . Suppose the loan had already been repaid and the authentic bonds returned to the vault . In that event there 'd be no proof of anything unless the counterfeiter could be found and made to talk . If the loan had been repaid and the original bonds returned to the vault , would Wesley Harrington have been killed ? Possibly . And would there have been an attempt to kill me too ? Possibly . I tried to reason it out . The fact that the original bonds had been returned to the vault did n't mean that a crime had n't been committed . Or would n't be committed again  --  whenever Anton Lipp happened to need money . Jars had to be traced . Unless the Bristol Bank was the bank that had made the loan and had a record of the bonds which had been used as collateral . The chances of that were slim , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at any bank in the Western world . The Jars girl had to be made to talk.
