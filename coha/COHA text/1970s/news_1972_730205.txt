txt The city-state dispute over welfare fraud statistics grew angrier , yesterday , with each side charging misrepresentation land deceit . City Human Resources Administrator Jule M. Sugarman , seeking , to discredit a charge by State Welfare Inspector General George F. Berlinger that 20 to 30 per cent of the cases on the city 's welfare rolls were ineligible for assistance , accused the state official of distorting the statistics for political purposes . Mr. Berlinger responded that the city 's figures were misleading because they were . incomplete . At a morning news conference , Mr. Sugarman cited a 1969 survey by the House Ways and Means Committee to back his own view that only 3 to 4. per cent of those on the welfare rolls were ineligible . The survey had shown ineligibility to be about 3.6 per cent . Mr. Sugarman also cited quarterly reviews of the figures submitted by his department to the State Department of Social Services as ' evidence of their validity . In an interview later , however , Bernard Shapiro , deputy commissioner of the depart . ment in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff reviews constituted no more than " mini-samplings " and could not be regarded as definitive . He said his staff had found 5 to 6 per cent of those on the welfare rolls ineligible . Mr. Shapiro added that the Legislature indicated its concern with the problem by ap- proving a supplemental budget appropriation of $1.2-million to allow him to increase his staff of four to 150 , He said that they would handle reports from throughout the state , but that 75 per cent of the staff would concentrate on New York City and its adjacent suburbs , starting July 1 . Mr. Sugarman said , " The pattern of action of the Inspector General the last few weeks has been to select his cases in a manner calculated to show high ineligibility rates , to substantially misjudge whether the cases were eligible , or not , and to generalize conclusions to the entire case load from very small and unreliable samples . " " I can only conclude , " Mr. Sugarman said , " that he has a point to make , and will make it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angry denial from Mr. Berlinger , who had said earlier in the week that his estimate of citywide ineligibility ranging from 20 to 30 per cent had stemmed from a sampling indicating 37 per cent of January 's new relief cases at one center had been ineligible . These involved 26 out of 70 cases at the Waverly Center , 12 West 14th Street . In an interview , Mr. Berlinger went on to charge the Human Resources Administrator with failure to complete studies of eligibility or quality control . He said the state had told Mr. Sugarman ? in December to review 383 cases at 10 centers . " His report of March 17 , " Mr. Berlinger said , " showed he did less than 50 per cent . He just completed 170 . Out of the rest , he said he was unable to locate 94 , 15 were unwilling to give information , two moved out of the state , two were in institutions and 58 others , he just did nothing on . " " It is my contention , " Mr. Berlinger added , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have agreed with me on ineligibility . His incomplete sampling gives misleading information . " Mr. Sugarman , visibly angered by the Inspector General 's charges , said he was sending a letter to Governor Rockefeller asking him to review Mr. Berlinger 's activities and statements and make a determination of their propriety . " I think the . Governor will take a correct look , " he said , " despite the fact that politics may be involved . " Mr. Berlinger said he would welcome any inquiry the Governor would like to make . " I think Governor Rockefeller is well aware of what we are doing , " he added . He was named to his post a year ago by the Republican Governor who had created the job as part of a package of welfare reform measures passed by the Legislature . Mr. Sugarman was questioned at the news conference about Mayor Lindsay 's upward revision last week of the savings to be made in welfare payments . In working toward a budget package , Mr. Lindsay raised the estimate of savings to $162-million from $100-million . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sanguine " about reaching this goal , but he was having his agency check eligibility and procedures more intensively than ever before . In what was called a " zero growth " order , he listed the savings he said would have to be achieved to reach the goal of a $162-million budget cutback as follows : The savings would be effected by gaining $52-million through a reduction of the number of ineligible persons on the welfare rolls ; $48-million from reducing the number of overpayments , and $6-million from lower Medicaid payments . In addition , the administration would seek to save $15-million by refusing 2,500 cases a month in the initial screening process ; another $15-million by holding the monthly caseload growth to 5,000 , rather than the 7,500 initially estimated ; and an equal amount through new legislation involving workrelief . Finally , it was estimated $6-million would be saved in eliminating duplicate checks , and $5-million from new controls over drug addicts . Mr. Berlinger , commenting on the proposed savings , said , " We think twice that amount can be saved . " Mr. Sugarman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York City ranking behind Boston and Baltimore in the precentage of persons on welfare last year , and which portrayed the caseload increase in the last four years in Nassau , Suffolk , Westchester and Rockland Counties as ranging from 7 to 99 per cent higher than that of New York City . These statistics brought from Mr. Berlinger the comment that " the issue is not what ' is happening around the country , or elsewhere in the state . " " This ? is simply a smokescreen to becloud the true issues , which are the large number of ineligibles , the doubling of the rolls in New York City and the manipulation of the ineligibility figures , " he said . The Human Resources Administrator conceded at his news conference that his agency was not operating at peak efficiency . operating have enormous error now , " he declared , " most of it due to employe problems with the complicated processing machinery . " But Mr. Sugarman , said that an 11-point program to improve efficiency in determining eligibility and in making payments , . announced a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoped there could soon be improvements . The plan calls , among other things , for face-to-face interviews with 600,000 people on the relief rolls in a process of recertification . But Mr. Brlinger declared : . yeste.rclay this'part of the program , which ' is to begin Monday , was impossible . " And if we have only 3'to 4 per cent ineligibility , " the state official said , " why do this to the poor ? " At the news conference , Mr. Sugarman distributed a copy of a letter he sent to the editor of The New York Times charging that the newspaper had made typographical , statistical and interpretative errors in an editorial in the May% 23 issue on the subject of the city 's welfare caseload . Mr. Sugarman said the errors were made in an editorial suggesting that Mayor Lindsay had exercised unilateral control over the rate of growth . of the case load for his own political purpose .
