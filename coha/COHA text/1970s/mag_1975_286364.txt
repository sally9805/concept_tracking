ABDUCTION <P> Directed by JOSEPH ZITO Screenplay by KENT E. CARROLL <P> In the beginning was an obscure soft-core paperback original to which no one paid special heed . Then came the Patty Hearst kidnaping , and someone noticed that cheap fiction seemed to predict this sensational crime in detail , even including the plot twist that had the victim eventually embrace the captors ' ideology . Parallels continue to turn up : recent reports indicate that Hearst surrendered to revolutionary sexuality even before succumbing to revolutionary politics-just as Abduction s heroine did . <P> The conjunction of a sleazy " property " and the most curious and enigmatic criminal case of recent years had to excite some schlockmeister , and so we have El Cheapo Production 's version of the book to contend with . The picture , featuring Judith-Marie Bergan , started out aiming for the coveted X rating , essential to success in the pornfields , then raised its sights . Its more graphically depicted sexual grapplings went into the trim barrel , an R rating was obtained , and it is no longer necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the film . <P> But hard-core sex was obviously the hard core of the film 's structure . Cut the crud and all you have left is a lot of tedious - not to say infantile - intellectual foreplay . Abduction can not be taken seriously enough to laugh at , and natural curiosity about links with the Hearst case should be sternly stifled .
