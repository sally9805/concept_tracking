For Penn State , once football 's Avis , winning never Hertz <P> How good can a college football team be and still not rank No. 1 in the nation ? Let Penn State count the ways . It has had 27 consecutive winning seasons and 40 straight years at .500 or better ( both modern N.C.A.A. records ) . Its coach of 13 years , Joe Paterno , boasts the highest winning percentage ( .833 ) of anyone still sending in signals after ten years of major college football warfare , including three unbeaten and untied seasons capped by victories in a major bowl ( 1968 , 1969 and 1973 ) . <P> Penn State did all this , and still remained the Avis of big-time college football . It was a frequent also-ran in the weekly A.P . and U.P.I , polls of sportswriters and coaches , but never was it No. 1 . This year , however , the men from State College , Pa. , finally made it to the top - first in all the polls and , after last week 's 17-10 win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left in the nation . <P> From such unfamiliar heights , Coach Paterno and his Nittany Lions are now preparing for a Sugar Bowl showdown with the Southeastern Conference champion . Paterno juggled bowl bids for a week because he wanted to make sure that Penn State would face its highest-ranked opponent . <P> Such maneuvering is a bit out of character for a school that talks football like the Ivy League but plays it like the Southwest Conference . ( Penn State is , in fact , an independent . ) Football has never been a mania at Penn State . Long before the N.C.A.A. this year clamped a 30-player annual limit on new recruits and a ceiling of 95 football scholarships overall , Paterno rarely recruited more than 25 players a year . By comparison , Oklahoma bestowed 40 to 50 scholarships a year before the new limits were imposed . Players point proudly to the absence of a jock aristocracy on the 27,000-student Penn State campus . There is no lush special housing for players ; they live in regular dormitories , and curfews are virtually unknown . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the season , and some 94% of Penn State 's footballers graduate on schedule after four years . Proclaims Paterno : " Football is n't everything . It 's just another extracurricular activity , like science club or the band . " <P> Paterno himself is just another slightly scholarly-looking tenured professor ( health , phys-ed and recreation ) , though his pupils bring in $5 million in annual revenues and $2 million in profits , which is plowed back into sports facilities for the rest of the.student body . Phys-ed classes at Penn State have first call on the school 's indoor arenas , so the Nittany Lions occasionally must sweep snow off their field in order to practice . Says Paterno : " We never had a rug in our locker room . We 're more spartan , and it 's more of a challenge . We recruit people who belong at Penn State academically as well as athletically . No one is a special person on our squad or in our school . "               @ @ @ @ @ @
