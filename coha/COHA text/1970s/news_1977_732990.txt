txt BEDMINSTEII , N. J. ? Telephone experts here are girding themselves for an expected surge of long-distance calls from all over the nation Saturday afternoon during a scheduled CBS radio collie to President Carter . Richard A. Esrey , network operations manager for the long lines department of the American Telephone and Telegraph Co. , describes the situation this way : " We have a potential Christmas . But this time everybody 's going to be trying to call Santa Claus , " Ills assignment was to set up u special network on Saturday , designed to allow callers in all regions an equal , if slim ; chance of reaching Carter ? and also to make sure the hundreds of thousands of normal Saturday-afternoon long distance dialers would not get frozen out of the system by the Carter callers . ESREY AND HIS colleagues , who advised choosing a Saturday for the call-in to ease potential circuit jam-ups , work at a computerized , month-old network operations center fur North America in the department 's new countryside head-quarters , The center 's control room , shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfort during crisis ( and televised data-screens . With a glassed-in visitors ' booth above , facing the huge maps and charts of the emitnent 's long-distance telephone circuits , the control room is a spacious theater compared to the cramped room the ' controtters used for years in New York City . Cooperating with 10 regional centers in the United States and 2 in Canada , the engineers here supervise some 700 million miles of intercity wire , cable , microwave , and satellite circuits , They are expected to spot jam-ups and route calls aver alternate pathways , Each of the 10 regional U. S. centers handles about to per cent of the nation 's 150 million telephones . ALTHOUGH long lines officials wince at the analogy , the problems of managing the nation 's long-distance network dining the unprecedented presidential call-in could very well resemble what occurs during natural disasters , When an earthquake strikes southern California , for example , as it did Feb. 9 , 1971 , people all over the nation pick up their telephones to try to reach friends or relatives in the affected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving through telephone wires at the speed of light , // The Bell Telephone System 's long lines communications center in Bedminster , N. J. , will coordinate calls from throughout the nation Saturday for President Carter 's phone-in . The center 's control room for North America is now , and it will be cooperating with 10 regional Centers and two in Canada . Engineers at the center will monitor 700 million miles of wire , cable , microwaves and satellite circuits . Through a special network , the center will see that normal long-distance calls are not interrupted . A special area code , designated 900 , has been created for the calls . Carter 's call-in : Like phoning Santa // begin searching their way through a pre-set " hierarchy " of primary and alternate routes , looking first for a direct circuit to the distant region and then for a way through a succession of regional centers . OF THE EQUIPMENT in the disaster area , Esrey said , " If you do n't protect the switching machine , nothing 's going to go through . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " With uncounted , and probably uncountable , Americans attempting to put a question to Carter at this Saturday 's broadcast , the situation is likely to recall earthquake or a tornado times at AT &T.; This time , however , they have at least had warning . On Saturday , the network controllers not only will be seeking to preserve normal conditions for non-Carter tong-distance calls , but also to maintain a steady flow of calls to the 20 CBS radio operators in the Executive Office Building next to the White House who will be receiving the Carter calls . THE MAIN SOLUTION to the problem was worked out in detail about two weeks after initial inquiries reached telephone engineers late in January . It was to set up a special area code , designated NO , for the calls to the President and to establish controls so that the flow of calls from each of " the nation 's 10 regions would be equal . Calls from any of the nation 's 16,000 local telephone exchanges will be routed to several hundred long-distance switching centers . These will allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 regional centers . The regional centers , according to a CBS radio announcement will " squeeze the flow " so that six calls at a time go to the 20 lines in Washington . Calls from Washington itself will be routed through the regional center in Wayne , Pa. , outside Philadelphia . The toll-free number for the presidential call-in is 900.242-1611.
