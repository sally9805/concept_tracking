Officials at the National Institutes of Health were quite understandably disturbed and mystified . Eight patients under treatment for cancer had suddenly been struck with blood poisoning ; until doctors learned what caused the condition , they were powerless to prevent other patients from being infected . Unable to find the cause on their own , the NIH doctors called in investigators from the U.S. Public Health Service 's Center for Disease Control in Atlanta . <P> The move proved sound . After ruling out food and person-to-person transmission of the infection , the CDC men learned that all of the patients had received platelets-blood components that help promote clotting-from the same donor . Following up that clue , they found that the man unknowingly had chronic , asymptomatic osteomyelitis , an infection of the bone that was the cause of the cancer patients ' new illness . The CDC 'S discovery helped the cancer victims and may have saved others as well . The man revealed that he had sold 57 pints of blood during a seven-month period , and the CDC was able to locate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Such scientific sleuthing is routine for the CDC , which is to communicable disease what the FBI is to crime . Since it was established in 1946 as an outgrowth of a World War II agency set up to control malaria , the CDC has tracked down the sources of typhoid epidemics , traced a hepatitis outbreak in Michigan to a single bakery worker , and hunted down untold thousands of venereal-disease victims in need of treatment . Its efforts are essential , since infectious diseases remain one of the country 's most troublesome health hazards . This year alone , they are expected to account for 140,000 deaths , cause children to miss 145 million days of school and cost the U.S. economy 130 million lost work days . <P> The agency that does battle against these diseases is small . The CDC , which can act on its own in interstate outbreaks or assist state and local health departments , has only 90 officers ; 50 are located at its headquarters in Atlanta , the rest spread across the country . Most of the officers are physicians ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relatively low pay ( $1,473 per month for a physician with two years of residency and dependents ) , most are enthusiastic about their work . " It 's a challenge , like detective work , " says Dr. John Bryan , a CDC staff officer . " In private practice , there really is a limit to the number of people you can serve . Here , in the long run , you benefit many more people than you could in private practice . " <P> Interstate Epidemic . CDC investigators are able to close the books on some cases with little trouble . They had few problems , for example , figuring out why a batch of plum wine that had fermented in an old bathtub caused lead poisoning in only one of several people who helped concoct the stuff . Under questioning , the man sheepishly revealed that he had consumed 50 gallons of it .
