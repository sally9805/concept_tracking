Four women are walking in the woods . They carry knapsacks and sleeping bags on their backs . One has a collasped fishing pole in a small case tied to the backpack . Another , JEANNE , walks with an open sketch pad behind the others , drawing them very fast as they walk before her . AVA laughs to herself from time to time as she walks . The largest woman , JESSICA , leads the way . She munches on blood sausage as she walks , a stick in a free hand to insure good footing or to hold branches out of the way for the others . M.J. has a camera with many different lenses in leather cases hanging about her neck as well as her pack on her back . The going is a bit rough , but not impossible . The progress is slow as they are climbing . For purposes of staging , they might walk in place , or they might use a zig zag pattern , as if they were climbing to the top of a small mountain , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to be staged . It depends on how you seat the audience , and the physical conditions you have to work with . JESSICA Not looking back but gesturing with food to one behind her . Want a bite of blood sausage ? M.J. What ? She takes picture . JESSICA That 's a damned expensive art form . p. 3 M.J. Tell me about it . JEANNE Want some bread for your sausage ? JESSICA Naw ... I always just munch it . There !

Stooping and clicking . What fucking sexy roots . JESSICA Must a been about up yonder where Will used to walk every morning out from the inn , and work on her books . Set up a little camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the valley stretching out , and the mountain at her back . AVA I used to see places like this while coming . M.J. In my first orgasms , I was a lotus blossom floating down the river . JEANNE You make me feel retarded . I was so scientific , but I did insist on being the doctor . I loved keeping my eyes open and looking ... It took dope to get me to enjoy the inside of my head . p. 4 JESSICA My professor at NYU tried to get me to expand that paper on Willa . AVA You going to ? JESSICA Been thinking about it . M.J. Clicking . How long ? JESSICA Fifteen years . M.J. You do n't look that old . JESSICA Winking at her . Do n't feel it either .

JESSICA They pitched a tent for her if she wanted to get out of the sun . M.J. Was she always alone ? JESSICA Except when she had proofs to correct , then Edith Lewis came with her , and they corrected proofs together . p. 5 JEANNE Dreamy-excited . They must have lain in the wild flowers to work , and every so often , when they were overcome with tension , stretched out and gazed up into the pine needles . AVA Smells so good . M.J. I 'm starving . AVA Jessica , check your compass . Is this as close as we can get to where she worked ? They all sit , and stretch out , and remove shoes and packs . JESSICA You go to school in America . You major in English . You get a Ph.D . in English ; all you ever hear about is that the spare sentence started with Hemingway . They act like Cather did n't exist . She did it long before . AVA I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary Baker Eddy ? AVA A darling older woman in Syracuse found it for me . This friend of mine who 's been in Christian Science all her life had never heard of it . JESSICA Did n't know it either till M.J. brought me the bio by Brown and Crone . JEANNE Think of them together . What an explosion in Boston . p. 6 AVA She lived there nine months doing a long profile on Eddy for McClure 's magazine . M.J. When ? AVA 1906 . M.J. Goddess ! That 's four years before my mother was even born ! JEANNE I adore you , you take everything so personally . M.J. Turning and clicking her camera at JEANNE . They just found in the latest study that people who think they 're the center of the Universe live longer than anyone else . JESSICA It 'll take you that long to develop your pictures .

JEANNE Like mine . AVA Can you imagine the noise , banging around trying to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I first discovered this terrific sensation on my clitoris . Then it took me a month to get into the right position . My mother could n't figure out what had happened to me . I ran home from the school bus and right into the shower , screaming about the filthy kids at school always getting me messed up . p. 8 JESSICA My paper for NYU was on the garden imagery in Cather 's work . It 's in all her books , in the title of her first story collection . The garden figures in ... JEANNE I thought her books were built on rocks . JESSICA The garden grew on top of the rock . JEANNE nods and sketches furiously . M.J. To JESSICA . You have such a powerful torso Jessica . I want to see your upper arms .

Look at this honky tonk culture we have to live in . M.J. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . I love to drive ninety-wild down the strip and ... JESSICA , would you please take off your shirt ? AVA and JEANNE exchange a kiss and a caress and look out over the valley . JEANNE rolls some joints and they pass them around . JESSICA declines with a wave of her hand , opens a bottle of Reisling , and takes a long drink , then hands that around . JESSICA Sure . She looks at M.J. for a beat , then takes off her shirt . Willa was into the garden even in the introductions to her books .... p. 9 JEANNE Gets me pissed to think I never learned anything about her before . AVA Up to now , only librarians and third grade teachers were in love with her . JEANNE Right on ! They kept the faith . JESSICA That 's how they were able to discredit her , but Mencken always put her up there ... the machos tried to bring her down associating her with grade school and romance , and reaction , but she kept the garden growing even though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drippings of the tractors began to replace the horsedroppings it was the beginning of the end for a healthy Mother Earth ... Trance state quoting . " We were talking about what it is like to spend one 's childhood ... buried in wheat and corn , under stimulating extremes of climate : burning summers when the world lies green and billowy beneath a brilliant sky , when one is fairly stifled in vegetation , in the color and smell of strong weeds and heavy harvest ... " AVA Are we on the path to the cemetery ? JESSICA ... She did n't come back here after the hurricane of 38 ... tore up all her favorite views ... but she 's buried at the foot of Mt . Monadnock ... JEANNE Willa , Willie ... we want you to join us. p. 10 AVA When she was in her early teens she cut off all her hair and put on her brother 's clothes and walked all over town .

Being with you makes me feel like dancing ... and I believe in romance again ... come here into my arms , I want to feel you all . I 've looked at you long enough ... M.J. and AVA crawl close to JEANNE , and they begin to fondle and softly kiss one another . JEANNE Lights candles and places them around the edges of a blanket , puts oil on the forehead of each of the women ... Lights incense and passes around one more joint ... This loving is for Willa Cather ... p. 11 AVA Come join us Jessica ? JESSICA Thanks , but I think somebody better stand guard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goddess , the light on you is fantastic ! She puts down her camera and turns to embrace the other two ... JEANNE While kissing M.J. and AVA . We 'll take turns guarding ... The lights blaze up , then down and out.
