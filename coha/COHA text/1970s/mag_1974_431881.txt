 | ROBERT FROST : THE SOUND OF LOVE AND THE LOVE OF SOUND He was the most popular American poet of the century , and his popularity has become a kind of embarrassment to those who would recognize his greatness . On the hundredth anniversary of the birth of Robert Frost , it would not be consistent with his own toughness of mind were we simply to honor his memory without asking ourselves finally what he has left us , what still makes us care about him . In doing so , in trying to place Frost in our cultural history , it is important not to lose sight of the most evident peculiarity of his career : unlike many of his great contemporaries in poetry ? Yeats , Lawrence , Stevens , and Eliot ? Frost was from the start a truly popular poet . Before he belonged to the profession of criticism , he belonged to the general public .. He still does . It would be presumptuous , if it were even possible , to say that the Frost who enthralled readers and listeners across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is a " real " Frost underneath who can be reached only by those able to stand the pressures of supposedly uncharted depths . The general public , however partial its estimate , is no more wrong about Frost than it was wrong in the last century about Wordsworth . If , as Frost says in " Hyla Brook , " " We love the things we love for what they are , " then we must assent to some apparent facts : that Frost is available to us in ways that are more agreeable than disturbing , that he leaves us feeling more , rather than less , confident about ourselves and our capacities . By reading him you may make your life more complicated , but you do not make it more unmanageable . You are not led to believe that life is unintelligible or that your capacity to make sense of it merely proves the triviality of your involvement . This is a most generous legacy , but it is entailed , like any legacy . Excluded from the list of beneficiaries are those who look for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to any rough beasts living in New Hampshire that famous rough beast who is presumably still slouching " toward Bethlehem to be born . " So far as Frost is concerned , the very measure of poetic performance is in the degree to which it can domesticate the imagination of disaster . Now and then one may want to call him " a terrifying poet , " as did Lionel Trilling , to the consternation of old-line Frostians , on the occasion of Frost 's eighty-fifth birthday . But he is for the most part so anxious not to be terrifying that in far too many poems terror is speciously provoked only that it may be contained by his ironies . One of the best clues to his special genius is in a letter ( to The Amherst Student ) written at the time of yet another birth-@#  | day , his sixtieth . He proposes a saving virtue in the very circumscriptions of form , poetic or otherwise : Fortunately we do n't need to know how bad the age is . There is something we can always be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age is . There is at least so much good in the world that it admits of form and the making of form . And not only admits of it , but calls for it . We people are thrust forward out of the suggestions of form in the rolling clouds of nature . In us nature reaches its height of form and through us exceeds itself . When in doubt there is always form for us to go on with . Anyone who has achieved the least form to be sure of it , is lost to the larger excruciations . I think it must stroke faith the right way . The artist , the poet , might be expected to be the most aware of such assurance , but it is really everybody 's sanity to feel it and live by it . Fortunately , too , no forms are more engrossing , gratifying , comforting , staying , than those lesser ones we throw off like vortex rings of smoke , all our individual enterprise and needing nobody 's cooperation : a basket , a letter , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a poem . In deciding what Frost has left us , we can not , however , depend too smugly on the testament of such a passage as this or on the support it lends to popular conceptions of Frost 's work . His popularity can even be a kind of embarrassment to those who want to claim for him some more exalted literary estimate . It has become difficult , that is , to read him with that intent carefulness we have learned to give to those great poets of our century who never defected to the general public . To read a popular poet is to understand him , give or take an inessential quibble , and to have read him once is to have read him forever . Beloved poets are supposed to be familiar . Great poets are supposed to be remote . The special advantage these days to anyone considered a great poet is that he gets an especially deferential treatment ; if anything seems awry or confused it is not his fault but ours . Every coloration , every nuance , every comma is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some degree placed beyond criticism ; it becomes instead the subject of something close to biblical interpretation . It can be said of Eliot or Yeats that though there may be many jewels inaccurately assessed in their oeuvre , very few have gone unnoticed . But to read the Collected Poems of Robert Frost is to come again and again on marvelous poems that have mostly been neglected ? " The Subverted Flower " is one , " The Draft Horse " another ? this , in the works of a poet who was born , after all , a hundred years ago this March . More significantly , the same can be said for parts of the familiar poems . Everyone knows " The Death of the Hired Man " so well that few bother to read it . Perhaps because it has cropped up in nearly every anthology since childRobert Frost in 1959  | hood , most readers , if they 're like me , have taken in far too easy a stride such passages as the silent communion in the moonlight . It occurs during a break in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the old man who has come back to stay with them : Part of a moon was falling down the west , Dragging the whole sky with it to the hills . lts light poured softly in her lap . She saw it And spread her apron to it . She put out her hand Among the harp-like morning-glory strings , Taut with the dew from garden bed to eaves , As if she played unheard some tenderness That wrought on him beside her in the night . " Warren , " she said , " he has come home to die : You need n't be afraid he 'll leave you this time . " Notice here how Frost guards against any large embracing gesture , even though his metaphors strain in that direction . There is a kind of magnitude initially proposed in the image of the moon " falling down the west , /Dragging the whole sky with it to the hills . " Yet looking closer we see that it 's only a part of the moon , part only of " a moon , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there has been and will be many another moon . The images are prevented from carrying any melodramatic portent of death by being snatched up into familiarity and domesticity . Thus when she sees the moonlight she spreads her apron to it ? receives it , so to speak , into her household with the same quiet generosity and composure with which earlier in the day she had received the returning hired man , old and sick . What calls for admiration here is restraint . The poetic achievement is at the same time a process of denial , of denying oneself the pretentious magnitude of which Frost was habitually wary . This kind of restraint has most often been associated with Frost 's irony , his famous irony . But that irony , as in " Once by the Pacific , " is vefy often , for me at least , Frost 's way of merely exorcising " excruciations " when he has not been able to prevent his poetry from conveying them far more powerfully than he intends . The poetic movement illustrated by the brief passage above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something extraordinarily beautiful in its affectionate precision , its human intimacy , and doing it so as to tame , to discipline , to housebreak , we might say , metaphors that are ready to transform the experience into portentousness . The attention asked for by these lines is quite alien to the kind of reading we have been habituated to by most twentieth-century poetry and by most twentieth-century criticism of it . Usually , by close inspection of metaphors or of tones of voice , by recognition of philosophically or psychologically @#  | structured images , the reading moves gradually outward , the poem is expanded , techniques are translated into meanings . The line between the poem and mythology gradually becomes blurred : drama and voice become at last little more than a pretext ? in a literal sense of that word . Frost is a poet who obstinately resists that process . It 's not too much to say that he writes against the disposition ? poetic , critical , human just described . This reluctance to reward the kinds of attention to which readers of Yeats and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever gave a good picture of either Eliot or Yeats ? would by itself be enough to make him both popular and unfashionable . But to compound the difficulty , the rewards Frost does offer require , I think . an even more strenuous kind of attention . Once you have decided , that is , to look for the remarkable power hidden behind the benign-ironic masks of his personality , you discover that Frost is quite without gratitude for small favors . He makes you work very hard indeed , simply to find out how much he 's denying you by way of large significances . He will not let you have him as a poet in the style of Eliot or of Yeats ; he will not let you even discuss him in the same terms . So that while , in the care you lavish upon him , you find yourself resolutely treating him like a very great poet , he is just as resolutely disqualifying the terms normally used to describe one . @# One reason it is n't easy to show how and why Frost is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extraordinarily difficult to stabilize for the sake of description . They are located in a highly volatile mixture of sound and sense , in elusive modulations of voice , and in the use of metaphor to explore rather than establish meaning . His poems , as he has remarked , may be taken as only a " momentary stay against confusion . " The stay against confusion is for the duration of the poem ; it is in the figure the poem makes , the action of the poem in its movement , and not in any attitudes notions extrapolated from it . If it could be said that his poems are therefore some version of Eliot 's " fragments . . . shored against my ruins , " then one of many differences would have to be that Frost , more than Eliot , is pleased enough with momentariness , with his quite extraordinary satisfaction in the poem as a human performance , in the poem as an exemplification of how to perform in the face of the confusions of life or the impositions of authority , including literary authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his genius so hard to account for . It can only be accounted for by the most precise notation of how he performs , of how he momentarily achieves a stay in particular poems and particular lines , even par- ticular feet . It is as if the world of other people and of things , including again other poets and poems , existed in a sound which is not his and to which he will succumb if he does not fashion a sound of his own . Each poem is an act of such confrontation starting from scratch and with a dance of his losing . In poem after poem , all that es other than himself is identified by sound , either seductive or threatening , either meaningful or brute . There is the sound of the wind and the rain , of trees in their rustling , of the scythe in the field , the cry in the night , the beating on a box by a lonely old man , the movement of a beast , the song of birds , the voice of a lover or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this obsession with sound and its possible clues , with siknee and its promise of visionary afflatus . But now here is the person who is vulnerable to these sounds and silences so often characterized not as a common man but as the common man who is a poet , a " maker " of poetry . The figure shown to be listening is also shown to be making countersounds with language , to be making a poem . The juxtaposition begins early , in A Boy 's Will , his first . plume , where it is entangled in his poems about love . One of the best of these early poems is - Mowing " : There was never a sound beside the wood but one , And that was my long scythe whispering to the ground . What was it it whispered ? I knew not well myself ; Perhaps it was something about the heat of the sun , Something , perhaps , about the lack of sound ? And that was why it whispered and did not speak . It was no dream of the gift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fay or elf : Anything more than the truth would have seemed too weak To the earnest love that laid the swale in rows , Not without feeble-pointed spikes of flowers ( Pale orchises ) , and scared a bright green snake . The fact is the sweetest dream that labor knows . My long scythe whispered and left the hay to make . The rather comically clumsy question , metrically at least , " What was it it whispered ? , " the repeated use of " perhaps , " and the ascription not so much of communicating power as of reticent good manners to the whispering of the scythe ? all of this marks the poet-mower as someone who is to be differentiated from certain poetic antecedents in English poetry of the last century . One is reminded instead of Thoreau in the magnificent chapter in Walden on " The Bean Field . " Both workers in the field , as Thoreau says , work " for the sake of tropes and expression , " but both are also aware that it is only the " me " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a field hand and an artist of human sounds . The two occupations depend dialectically upon one another . " I was determined to know beans , " says Thoreau , however ecstatic he becomes , while hoeing them , about the loss of the self to natural ( and therefore artistic ) processes ; similarly , Frost disowns dreams , fags , and elves for the truth ? playing meanwhile , as Thoreau does , on quantitative paradoxes : " Anything more than the truth would have seemed too weak/To the earnest love that laid the swale in rows . " It is " earnest love " indeed , allowing notice of the little details of " feeblepointed spikes of flowers , " just as Thoreau will not ever let the most mundane of considerations escape his eye . Thus it is that the real dream , the sweet dream , is not of " easy gold " but of a completed fact ? the swale in rows . Facts are nonetheless a dream , too , just as is the " dream of the gift of idle hours " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as in " After Apple-Picking , " when the job is done , then the visual , tactile evidence of a completed work is merely an invitation to think , to dream , as the poet-mower is doing , about the action that brought it about . You can literally make hay while the sun shines ; but only a poet can dream of making hay , in another sense , when it is all over with . The pun on " make , " evoking the classic image of the " poet as maker , " is the high point in the Thoreauvian movement of the poem , recalling as it does Thoreau 's comment , again in the bean field chapter , that " he sometimes made a day of it . " The same play on " make " occurs even more obtrusively in Frost 's " The Oven Bird " : " The question that he frames in all but words/ Is what to make of a diminished thing . " Reuben Brower offers a good comment on " Mowing " when he says : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act Frost renews the Wordsworthian sympathy between man and his world , but he does so in a decidedly American accent . The higher value for Frost is pragmatic , the fruit of action is in the moment . " The action in the moment is not only the acting dramatized by the poem but the poem itself as an enactment , an act of " earnest love . " Many of the early poems , wherein I think one finds some of the psychological and structural source of all Frost 's poetry , are about the relation of love to poetic vision and poetic making , of " making " it in all those senses . And they are also poems , ut sound and the danger of being silenced by failure in love . @# The kind of " earnest love " that most concerns Frost in A Boy 's Will ? and which appears in poems written in the same period but held for publication until after the death of his wife Elinor in 1930 ? is , biographically , the passionate and stormy love which he felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seventeen , she nearly two years older , and they sat next to one another in Lawrence High School , Massachusetts . From the outset , he exhibited jealousy of her ability as a poet ? she stopped writing poems as a re-53  | sult and in later life tried to disguise and disown authorship of poems that appeared in the School Bulletin ? of her knowledge of literature , her marks in school ? they were co-valedictorians , but her average was finally higher ? of her abilities as a painter , of her suitors at St. Lawrence University at Canton , New York . Her attendance at college meant their separation , he to Dartmouth for a short time , then to teach in the Methuen schools till March , then to act as helper and guardian to Elinor 's mother and two of her sisters in Salem , New Hampshire . He had courted her with the help of Shelley 's poetry , especially " Epipsychidion , " and Shelley 's inducements to the social rebelliousness of lovers , notably against the institution of marriage . And , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own . Indeed his first volume , strictly speaking , is n't A Boy 's Will , of 1913 , when he was thirty-nine , but Twilight , of 1894 , when he was twenty , the one surviving copy of which is in the Barrett Collection at the University of Virginia . Only two were printed , one for Frost and one for Elinor . It included four love poems , full of literary echoes ranging from Sidney to Keats , Tennyson , and Rossetti , and he carried Elinor 's copy on an unannounced trip to her college boardinghouse in Canton , New York . Surprised , bewildered , unable to invite him in or to go out herself , she accepted her copy in what seemed a casual but was doubtless a merely preoccupied way and told him he must return home at once . He did so only to pack a bag and leave immediately for a suicide journey that took him to Virginia and into the Dismal Swamp . The danger was very real . " I was , " he was later to say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was at other later times to consider the possibility that he might " throw me down an unconsoled/And utter loss . " Through subsequent travails , torments , threats , melodramatic scenes , he finally convinced her to marry him even though it meant she could n't finish school and he could n't promise any secure means of support . As he was later to say , with tense reminiscent determination , " I broke her to my will . " Such briefly are the biographical elements that inform many of the early poems . But the biographical material does n't tell us as much about the man as the poetry does . By that I mean that the poetry does n't necessarily come from the experiences of his life ; rather the poetry and the life experiences emerge from the same configuration in him prior to his poems or to his experience . Sex and an obsession with sound , sexual love and poetic imagination partake of one another , are in some sense the same . As he observes in " The Figure a Poem Makes " ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as not merely a " made " but a " making thing " ) , " The figure is the same as for love . " And as he continues , the metaphors , without 54 his even having to intend it , so central is the identification of making love and making poems , assume a peculiarly sexual suggestiveness : " No one can really hold that the ecstasy should be static and stand still in one place . It begins in delight , it inclines to the impulse , it assumes direction with the first line laid down , it runs a course of lucky events , and ends in a clarification of life ? not necessarily a great clarification , such as sects and cults are founded on , but in a momentary stay against confusion . . . . It finds its own name as it goes and discovers the best waiting for it in some final phrase at once wise and sad . . .. " @# The form which is a poem is a display of prowess not easily distinguished from the display of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best understand the passionate commitment by Frost to certain theories of sound and poetic form . The commitment found in his later prose is a derivative of the same feelings that inform such early poems as " Mowing , " " Waiting , " " In a Vale , " and " A Dream Song , " and all look forward to so incomparably finer and later a poem as " Never Again Would Birds ' Song Be the Same . " In a letter to the Negro poet-critic-anthologist William Stanley Braithwaite of March 22 , 1915 . Frost said : " It would seem absurd to say it ( and you must n't quote me as saying it ) but I suppose the fact is that my conscious interest in people was at first no more than an almost technical interest in their speech ? in what I used to call their sentence sounds ? the sound of sense. - Whatever these sounds are or are n't ( they are certainly not of the vowels and consonants of words nor even of the words themselves but something the words are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the printed page ) whatever they are , I say , I began to hang on them very young . I was under twenty when I deliberately put it to myself one night after good conversation that there are moments when we actually touch in talk what the best writing can only come near . . . . We must go into the vernacular for tone . hat have n't been brought to book . We must v . e with the ear on the speaking voice . We must imagine the speaking voice . " This urgency about imagining the " speaking voice " is initiated by something more than a concern for the writing of poetry ; it is compelled instead by a conviction that love is a prior condition to the hearing of that form of sound which is human communication in sentences . By sentence sounds Frost means something quite different . therefore , from the meaning of words in a sentence . A word is a quite different kind of sound , as he makes clear in a letter dated a little over a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been one of Frost 's favorite students at Pinkerton Academy :  | I give you a new definition of a sentence : A sentence is a sound in itself on which other Sounds called words may be strung . You may string words together without a sen:ence-sound to string them on just as you may tie Jothes together by the sleeves and stretch them ' A ithout a clothes line between two trees , but ? it is bad for the clothes . . . . The sentence-sounds are very definite entities . : s ( This is no literary mysticism I am preaching . ) They are as definite as words . It is not impossible that they could be collected in a book though I do n't at present see on what system they would be catalogued . They are apprehended by the ear . They are gathered by the ear from the vernacular and brought into books . Many of them are already familiar to us in books . I think no writer invents them . The most original writer only catches them fresh from talk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writer if all his words are strung on definite recognizable sentence-sounds . The voice of the imagination , the speaking voice must know certainly how to behave how to posture in every sentence he offers . When Frost refers to " the vocal imagination , " he makes it synonymous ( in the essay " The Constant Symbol " ) with what he calls " images of the voice speaking . " Frost listens for these images as much in nature as in human dialogue . The difference is that only in human dialogue can such images emerge as " sentence sounds " rather than as vagrant noises , the sweep of wind and downy flake , or mere words . His capacity to find these images in nature depends upon human love . The supreme expression of this complex of feelings , and one of the most beautiful poems in our language , is " Never Again Would Birds ' Song Be the Same " : He would declare and could himself believe That the birds there in all the garden round From having heard the daylong voice of Eve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of meaning but without the words . Admittedly an eloquence so soft Could only have had an influence on birds When call or laughter carried it aloft . Be that as may be , she was in their song . Moreover her voice upon their voices crossed Had now persisted in the woods so long That probably it never would be lost . Never again would birds ' song be the same . And to do that to birds was why she came . Some of the motifs here recur throughout Frost : the comparison between the sound of birds and human sound ; the radical effect upon nature of the quality of that human sound , here a benignly conceived effect due apparently to the gregarious pleasantness of " call or laughter . " But the poem is about Eve and therefore about Eden and the fall , and we know that the effect of Eve 's " eloquence " was not in every sense " sweet . " In its way of acknowledging the various time elements at work in the poem and in the reading of it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for : of birds , of Eve , of the adoring Adam , of the speaker as a later Adam , and , by inference , of all of us as later Eves and Adams ? in doing all this , the poem illustrates what Frost means by " the constant symbol " : " Every single poem written regular is a symbol small or great of the way the will has to pitch into commitments deeper and deeper to a rounded conclusion and then be judged for whether any original intention it had has been strongly spent or weakly lost ; be it in art , politics , school , church , business , love , or marriage ? in a piece of work or in a career . Strongly spent is synonymous with kept . " In " art . . . love , or marriage , " you will observe the similarity evoked here . The poem is a marvelous illustration of the creative power of love upon sound and upon form , not only in the garden of Eden , not only in the doting pride of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both of them and for our common heritage . . . To do that to birds was why she came . " To do this , he might say , to a poet , the man who by the personalized tone of his relationship to Eve and Adam can still hear these " oversounds " with love and composure , with complicity and gratitude . Any falling , of leaves , of snow , of man , can be redeemed by loving , and the sign of this redemption is , for Frost , the sound and the form of poetry . 55
