 | the one that was normally occupied by a couple named Waller . The boy looked about five or six . He had dark closecropped hair and anxious blue eyes . " Is it all right if I come out ? " " It 's all right with me . " Leaving the door wide open , he moved toward me with exaggerated caution , so as not to frighten the birds . The jays were swooping and screeching , intent on outwitting each other . They paid no attention to him . " What are you feeding them ? Peanuts ? " " That 's right . Do you want some ? " " No thanks . My daddy 's taking me to visit my grandma . She always gives me a lot of stuff to eat . She feeds birds , too . " After a silence , he added : " I would n't mind feeding the jays some peanuts . " I offered him the open can . He took a fistful of peanuts and flung them on the grass . The jays came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bloodlessly . The boy turned pale . " Are they killing each other ? " he said in a tense small voice . " No . They 're just fighting . " " Do jays kill other birds ? " " Sometimes they do . " I tried to change the subject : " What 's your name ? " " Ronny Broadhurst . What kind of birds do they kill ? " " Young birds of other species . " The boy lifted his shoulders and held his folded arms close to his chest , like undeveloped wings . " Do they kill children ? " " No . They 're not big enough . " This seemed to encourage him . " I 'll try one of the peanuts now . Okay ? " " Okay . "  | He placed himself in front of me , face up and squinting against the morning light . " Throw it and I 'll catch it in my mouth . " I threw a peanut , which he caught , and after that quite a few others . Some he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were all around him like chunks of broken sky . A young man in a peppermint-striped sport shirt came into the yard from the street . He looked like a grown-up version of the boy and gave the same impression of anxiety . He was puffing rapidly on a thin brown cigarillo . As if she had been watching for the man , a woman with her dark hair in a pony-tail stepped out through the open door of the Wallers ' apartment . She was pretty enough to make me conscious that I had n't shaved . The man pretended not to see her . He spoke to the boy formally : " Good morning , Ronald . " The boy glanced at him but did n't turn . As the man and the woman moved on him from different directions , the boy 's face had lost its look of reckless pleasure . His small body seemed to grow smaller as if under the pressure of their meeting . He answered the man in a tiny voice : " Good morning . " The man turned brusquely to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have you been telling him , for God 's sake ? " " We have n't been talking about you , Stan . For our own sake . " The man thrust his head forward . Without moving his feet , he gave the impression of attacking . " What does that mean , for our own sake ' ? Is that an accusation ? " " No , but I can think of a few if you like . " " So can I. " His eyes moved in my direction . " Who 's Ronny 's playmate ? Or is he your playmate ? " He brandished the hottipped cigarillo in his hand .  | " I do n't even know this gentleman 's name . " " Would that make a difference ? " He did n't look at me . The woman 's face lost its color , as if she had become suddenly ill . " This is hard to take , Stan . I do n't want trouble . " " If you did n't want trouble , why did you move out on me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a thin voice : " Is that girl still in the house ? " " We wo n't discuss her . " Abruptly he turned to the boy . " Let 's get out of here , Ron . We have a date with Grandma Nell in Santa Teresa . " The boy was standing between them with his fists clenched . He looked at his feet . " I do n't want to go to Santa Teresa . Do I have to ? " " You have to , " the woman said . The boy edged in my direction . " But I want to stay here . I want to stay with the man . " He took hold of my belt and stood with his head down , his face hidden from all adults . His father moved on the boy . " Let go of him . " " I wo n't . " " Is he your mother 's boyfriend ? Is that what he is ? " " No . " " You 're a little liar . " The man threw down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy . I took hold of the boy under the arms , swung him out of reach , and held him . He was trembling . The woman said : " Why do n't you let him be , Stan ? You can see what you 're doing to him . " " What you 're doing to him . I came here to take him on a nice trip . Mother 's been looking forward to it . So what happens ? " His voice rose in complaint . " I run into a nasty family scene , and Ron 's all fixed up with a substitute father . " " You 're not making too much sense , " I said . " Ron and I are neighborsvery new neighbors . I only just met him . "  | " Then put him down . He 's my son . " I put the boy down . " And keep your dirty hands off him . " I was tempted to slug the man . But it would n't do the boy any good , and it would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quietest tone I knew : " Go away now , mister . " " I 've got a right to take my son with me . " The boy said to me : " Do I have to go with him ? " " He 's your father , is n't he ? You 're lucky to have a father who wants to take you places . " " That 's right , " his mother put in . " Go along now , Ronny . You always get along better with your father when I 'm not around . And Grandma Nell will be sad if you do n't visit her . " The boy went to his father , head down , and put his hand in the man 's hand . They headed for the street . The woman said : " I apologize for my husband . " " You do n't need to . He means nothing to me . " " He does to me , though , that 's the trouble . He 's so terribly aggressive . He was n't always like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't have survived . " I meant this to be a light remark , but it fell heavily . The conversation died . I tried to revive it . " Are the Wallers friends of yours , Mrs. Broadhurst ? " " Yes . Professor Waller was my adviser when I was in school . " She sounded nostalgic . " As a matter of fact he still is my adviser . He and Laura both are . I called them at Lake Tahoe last night when I " She failed to finish the sentence . " Are they friends of yours ? " " Good neighbors . My name is Archer , by the way . I live upstairs . " She nodded . " Laura Waller mentioned you last night , when 7  | she offered me the use of their apartment . She said if I needed any kind of help , that I could call on you . " She gave me a small cool smile . " In a way I have already , have n't I ? Thank you for being so kind to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But we were ill at ease . As angry people do , her husband had left his impression on the morning . The scene he had made still echoed dismally in the air . As if to dispel it , she said : " I just perked some coffee . It 's Laura Waller 's special grind , and it looks as if it is n't going to get used . Would you like a cup ? " " Thanks , but it would n't be a good idea . Your husband might come back . " In the street I had heard a car door open and then close , but no engine starting up . " He 's pretty close to violence , Mrs. Broadhurst . " " Not really . " But her tone was questioning . " Yes , really . I 've seen a lot of them , and I 've learned not to stir them up when I can help it . " " Laura said that you 're a detective . Is that right ? " Something that looked like a challenge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but this is my day off . I hope . " I smiled , but I had said the wrong thing . A hurt look darkened her eyes and pinched her mouth . I blundered on : " May I have a raincheck , Mrs. Broadhurst ? " She shook her head , not so much at me as at herself . " I do n't knowI do n't know if I 'm going to stay here . " In the street the car door had opened . Stanley Broadhurst came back into the yard alone . " Do n't let me interrupt anything . " " There 's nothing to interrupt , " the woman said . " Where 's Ronny ? " " In the car . He 'll be all right after a little time with his father . " He spoke as if the boy 's father was someone else .  | " You forgot to give me his toys and animals and stuff . He said you packed them . " " Yes , of course . " Looking offended with herself , she hurried into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bag . " Give my best regards to your mother . " There was no warmth in her voice and none in his answer : " Of course . " They sounded like a couple who never expected to see each other again . A pang of fear went through medull , because I was used to suppressing fear . I think it was mainly fear for the boy . At any rate , I wanted to stop Broadhurst and bring the boy back . But I did n't . Broadhurst went out to the street . I climbed the outside stairs two at a time and walked quickly along the gallery to the front . A fairly new black Ford convertible was standing at the curb . A blond girl or woman in a sleeveless yellow dress was sitting in the front seat . Her left arm was around Ronny , who seemed to be holding himself in a strained position . Stanley Broadhurst got into the front seat . He started the engine and drove away in a hurry . I did n't get a look at the girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all bare shoulders and swelling breasts and flowing blond hair . The pang of fear I felt for the boy had become a nagging ache . I went into my bathroom and looked at my face as if I could somehow read his future there . But all I could read was my own past , in the marks of erosion under my eyes , the mica glints of white and gray in my twenty-four-hour beard . I shaved and put on a clean shirt and started downstairs again . Halfway down I paused and leaned on the handrail and told myself that I was descending into trouble : a pretty young woman with a likable boy and a wandering husband . A hot wind was blowing in my face . 9  | I walked past the closed door of the Wallers ' apartment and down the street to the nearest newsstand , where I bought the weekend edition of the Los Angeles Times . I lugged it home and spent most of the morning reading it . All of it , including the classified ads , which sometimes tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cold shower . Then I sat down at the desk in my front room , looked at the balance in my checkbook , and paid the phone and light bills . Neither was overdue , and it made me feel dominant and controlled . While I was putting my checks in envelopes , I heard a woman 's steps approaching the door . " Mr. Archer ? " I opened the door . Her hair was up , and she had on a short stylish multicolored dress and white textured stockings . There was blue shadow on her eyelids and carmine lipstick on her mouth . Behind all this she looked tense and vulnerable . " I do n't want to disturb you if you 're busy . " " I 'm not busy . Come in . " She stepped into the room and gave it a sweeping glance which lit up its contents like radar blips , one thing after another , and made me realize that the furniture was rather  | worn . I closed the door behind her and pulled the chair out from the desk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thank you . " But she remained standing . " There 's a fire in Santa Teresa . A forest fire . Did you know that ? " " No , but it 's fire weather . " " According to the radio report it flared up quite near to Grandma Nell'sto my mother-in-law 's estate . I 've been trying to get her on the phone . Nobody answers . Ronny 's supposed to be there , and I 'm terribly worried . " " Why ? " She bit her lower lip and got a trace of lipstick on her teeth . " I do n't trust Stanley to look after him properly . I should never have let him take Ronny away . " " Why did you ? " " I have no right to deprive Stanley of his son . And a boy needs his father 's companionship . " " Not Stanley 's , in his present mood . " She looked at me soberly and leaned toward me with one tentative hand extended . " Help me to get him back , Mr. Archer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Stanley ? " " Both of them . But it 's Ronny I 'm most concerned about . The man on the radio said they may have to evacuate some of the houses . I do n't know what 's going on in Santa Teresa . " She raised her hand to her forehead and covered her eyes . I led her to the chesterfield and persuaded her to sit down . Then I went out to the kitchen and rinsed a glass and filled it with water . Her throat vibrated as she drank . Her long white-stockinged dancer 's legs protruded into the shabby room as if from some more theatrical dimension . I sat at the desk , half-turned to face her . " What 's your mother-in-law 's number ? " She gave it to mc , with the area code , and I dialed direct .  | The phone at the other end buzzed urgently nine or ten times . The gentle crash of the receiver being lifted took me by surprise . A woman 's voice said : " Yes ? " " Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Her voice was firm but polite . " Stanley 's wife wants to talk to you . Hold on . " I handed the receiver to the young woman , and she took my place at the desk . I went into the bedroom , closing the door behind me , and picked up the extension phone by my bed . The older woman was saying : " I have n't seen Stanley . Saturday is my Pink Lady day , as he well knows , and I just got back from the hospital . " " Are n't you expecting him ? " " Perhaps later in the day , Jean . " " But he said he had a date with you this morning , that he had promised to take Ronny to see you . " " Then I presume he will . " The older woman 's voice had become guarded and more precise . " I fail to see why it 's so important " " They left here hours ago , " Jean said . " And I understand there 's a fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's why I rushed home from the hospital . You 'll forgive me now if I say goodbye , Jean . " She hung up , and so did I. When I went back into the living room , Jean was frowning at the receiver in her hand , as if it was a live thing which had died on her . " Stan lied to me , " she said . " His mother was at the hospital all morning . He took that girl to an empty house . " " Are you and Stanley breaking up ? " " I guess maybe we are . I do n't want to . " " Who is the blond girl ? "  | She lifted the receiver in her hand and slammed it down rather violently . I felt as if she was hanging up on me . " We wo n't discuss it , " she said . I changed the subject , slightly . " How long have you and Stanley been separated ? " " Just since yesterday . We 're not really separated . I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That she 'd take your side ? I would n't count on it . " She looked at me in some surprise . " Do you know Mrs. Broadhurst ? " " No . But I still would n't count on it . Does Mrs. Broadhurst have money ? " " Am Iis it so obvious ? " " No . But there has to be a reason for everything . Your husband sort of used his mother 's name to get Ronny away from you . " It sounded like an accusation , and she bowed her head under it . " Someone 's been talking to you about us . " " You have . " " But I did n't say anything about Mrs. Broadhurst . Or the blond . " " I thought you did . " She went into deep thought . It sat prettily on her , softening the anxious angularity of her posture . " I know . Last night , after I called the Wallers in Tahoe , they called you and filled you in on me . What did Laura say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They did n't call me . " " Then how do you know about the blond girl ? " " Is n't there always a blond girl ? " " You 're putting me on , " she said in a younger voice . " And under the circumstances it is n't very nice . " " Okay . I saw her . " I realized as I spoke that I was volunteering as a witnessher witnessand my last hope or pre-13  | tense of staying out of her life was being talked away . " She was in the car with them when they left here . " " Why did n't you tell me ? I would have stopped them . " " How ? " " I do n't know how . " She looked at her hands . All of a sudden her face was disorganized by a rueful flash of humor . " I could carry a wife sign , I guess , or sit down in front of the car . Or write a letter to an astronaut . " I interrupted her before she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it . And with the boy along , they 're not likely to do anything " I let the sentence trail off . She shook her lovely head . " I do n't know what they 're likely to do . The fact that they 're being so open , as you say , is one of the things that worries me . I think they 're both crazy . I mean it . He brought her home from the office last night , and asked her to stay for dinner without consulting me . She was high on something when she arrived , and pretty vague in her answers . " " What kind of an office does Stanley have ? " " He works for an insurance firm in Northridgethat 's where we live . She does n't work in the officeI do n't mean that . She would n't last a day . Possibly she 's a student at the college or even a high school student . She 's young enough . " " How young ? " " She ca n't be more than nineteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspicious right off . According to Stanley , she was an old school friend who 'd got in touch with him at the office . But he 's at least seven or eight years older than she is . " " What was she high on ? " " I have no idea . But I did n't like the things she said to Ronny . I did n't like them at all . I asked Stanley to get rid of her . He refused . So I called Laura Wallerand came here . " " Maybe you should n't have . "  | " I know that now . I should have stayed in my own house and had it out with them . The trouble is , Stanley and I have n't been close for a long time . He 's been wrapped up in his own concerns and completely uninterested in me . It sort of deprives a girl of any ground to stand on . " " Did you want out of the marriage ? " She considered the question soberly . " It never occurred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think about it . " She stood up , leaning like a model on my desk , with one hip out . " But not now , Mr. Archer . I have to go to Santa Teresa . Will you drive me there , and help me get Ronny back ? " " I 'm a private detective . I do these things for a living . " " Laura Waller told me . It 's why I asked you . And of course I expect to pay you . " I opened the door and set the self-lock . " What else did Mrs. Waller tell you about me ? " She said with her bright disorganized smile : " That you were a lonely man . " I waited for her in the front room of the Wailers ' apartment . The walls were lined with books , many of them in foreign languages , like insulation against the immediate present . She came out carrying a large handbag , and coats for herself and the absent boy . I got my car out of the garage at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headed inland for the Ventura Freeway . The early afternoon sun glared on the traffic , flashing unpredictably on windshields and chromium . I turned up the air conditioning . " That feels good , " she said . Her presence beside me sustained an illusive feeling that there was an opening there into another time-track or dimension . It had more future than the world I knew , and not so bloody much traffic . After I made the turn onto Sepulveda , I spent a little time preparing a remark . " I seem to be getting less lonely , Mrs. Broadhurst . " " Call me Jean . Mrs. Broadhurst sounds like my motherin-law . " " Is that bad ? " " Not necessarily . She 's a pretty good womana lady , in fact , and a good sport . But underneath all that she 's terribly sad . I suppose that 's what manners are for , to cover up . " " What 's she so sad about ? " " A lot of things . " She looked at the side of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite inquisitive , are n't you , Mr. Archer ? " " It 's my working habit . " " And you 're working ? " " You asked me to . Did the fact that I live where I do have anything to do with your moving in below ? " " The fact that you 're a detective ? " " Roughly , yes . " " It may have . You may have been part of the whole Gestalt . Does it matter ? " " To me it does . I do n't believe in coincidences . And I like to know exactly where I stand . " " You 're lucky if you do . " " Is that a threat ? " I said .  | " It 's more of a confession . I was thinking about myself and where I stand . " " While you 're confessingdid you send Ronny out this morning to help me feed the birds ? " " No . " Her tone was definite . " That was his own idea . " She added : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not much room for spontaneity , either . In your world . " " It is n't my world . I 'm interested in the whole Gestalt you mentioned . Tell me about it . " She said haltingly : " I do n't know what you want me to tell you . " " Everything that led up to this . " " You take it seriously , do n't you ? " I could hear the slight edge of surprise in her voice . " Yes . " " I take it seriously , too . After all it 's my life , and it 's going to pieces . But as for explaining it , I would n't know where to begin . " " Just give me the pieces . You 've already started , with Mrs. Broadhurst . What 's she so sad about ? " " She 's getting old . " " So am I , and I 'm not sad . " " Are n't you ? Anyway , it 's different for a woman . " " Is n't Mr. Broadhurst getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He ran away with another woman some years ago . Stanley seems to be repeating the pattern . " " How old was he when his father took off ? " " Eleven or twelve . Stanley never talks about it , but it was the main event of his childhood . I have to remember that when I 'm judging him . When his father left , I think he felt even worse than his mother did . " " How do you know , if he never talks about it ? " 17  | " You ask good questions , " she said . " Give me a good answer , Jean . " She took her time . I could n't see her face , but peripheral vision made me aware of her sitting beside me with her hands in her lap . Her head was bowed over her empty hands as if she was trying to untie a knot or unwind a ball of string . " My husband has been looking for his father for some time , " she said , " and gradually breaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 's been looking for his father in the hope that it would put him back together . " " Did Stanley have a breakdown ? " " Nothing as definite as that . But his whole life has been a kind of breakdown . He 's one of those overconfident people who turns out to have no confidence at all . And it makes him stupid . He barely got through the university . As a matter of fact , that was how I met him . I was in his French class , and he hired me to tutor him . " She added with a kind of ironic precision : " The tutorial relationship persisted into our marriage . " " It can be tough on a man , to be married to a woman smarter than he is . " " It can be tough on the woman , too . But I did n't say I was smarter than Stanley , exactly . He 's just a man who has n't found himself . " " Is he looking ? " " He 's been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " For his father . " " That 's the way he puts it to himself . He seems to feel that when his father ran out on him , it robbed his life of its meaning . That sounds like nonsense , but it is n't really . He 's angry at his father for abandoning him ; at the same time he misses him and loves him . The two together can be paralyzing. "  | The depth of feeling in her voice surprised me . She cared for her husband more than she admitted . We crossed the low pass and began the descent into the valley . Above its floor , layers of brown dust were stacked in the air , obscuring the mountains on the far side . Like something in an old movie , a World War Two bomber labored up from Van Nuys Airport and turned north . It was probably headed for the fire in Santa Teresa . I did n't mention this to the woman beside me . Another thought had begun to nag at my mind . If Stanley was following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl , he would n't be likely to head straight for the town where his mother lived . Las Vegas , or possibly Mexico , was a more likely destination . We passed a " Northridge " sign . I glanced at the woman . She was bent forward , unwinding her invisible ball of string . " How far is your house from the freeway ? " " About five minutes . Why ? " " We ought to check there . We do n't know that Stanley took the boy to Santa Teresa . " " You think they may be at the house ? " " It is n't likely , but it 's possible . Let 's have a look , anyway . " It was on a street named College Circle , one of a group of brand new houses with two-story porticoes supported by large wooden pillars . They were differentiated by their colors . The Broadhurst house was dark blue with light blue pillars . Jean went in at the front door . I found when I followed the driveway around to the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , as if the architect had tried to combine a southern plantation mansion with the slave quarters . A grape-stake fence separated the back yard from the neighbors ' . The garage door was locked . I went around to the window 19  | at the side . The only car in the double garage , a green Mercedes sedan , bore no resemblance to the black convertible Stanley had been driving . Jean opened the back door of the house from the inside . She gave me an appalled look , and came running across the grass to the garage window . " They 're not in there , are they ? " " No . " " Thank heaven . I thought for a minute they 'd committed suicide or something . " She stood beside me at the window . " That 's not our car . " " Whose is it ? " " It must be hers . I remember nowshe and Stanley came in separate cars last night . She has her nerveleaving her car in my garage . " Jean turned toward me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Ronny 's bed . I do n't like that . " " Show me . " I followed her in through the back door . The house was already showing signs of abandonment . In the kitchen , unwashed dishes were piled in the sink and on the counters . On the top of the free-standing stove were a skillet half full of congealed grease and a saucepan containing something that smelled like pea soup but looked like cracked green mud . And there were flies . The boy 's room on the second floor was papered with pictures of friendly animals . The bedclothes were rumpled and twisted , as if the girl visitor had spent a troubled night . The red marks of her mouth were on the pillow , like a signature , and under the pillow was a copy of the novel Green Mansions bound in faded green cloth . I examined the flyleaf of the book . It had a bookplate with an engraving of an angel or a muse writing in a scroll with a peacock-plume pen . The name on the bookplate was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in pencil : Jerry Kilpatrick . I closed the book and slipped it into my jacket pocket . Jean Broadhurst came into the room behind me . " At least he did n't sleep with her . " " Where did your husband sleep ? " " In his study . " She showed me the little room on the ground floor . It contained a few shelves of books , a closed rolltop desk , an unmade daybed , and a gray steel filing cabinet standing like a cenotaph at the head of the bed . I turned to the woman : " Does Stanley usually sleep in here ? " " You ask some pretty personal questions . " " You 'll get used to it . I take it that he does usually sleep in here . " She colored . " He 's been working at night on his files . He does n't like to disturb me . " I gave the top drawer of the filing cabinet a tentative pull . It was locked . " What kind of files does he keep in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . " His father 's file ? " " Stanley keeps a file on his fathereverything he 's been 21  | able to dig up about him , which is n't much . And all the false leadsthe dozens of people he 's talked to or written to , trying to find out where his father is . It 's been his main occupation these last couple of years . " She added wryly : " At least I 've known where he was keeping himself nights . " " What sort of a man was his father ? " " I do n't actually know . It 's funny , with all this information " she tapped the metal side of the filing cabinet " Stanley does n't really talk about him at all . He has long silences on the subject . His mother has even longer silences . I do know he was a captain of infantry in the Pacific . Stanley has a picture of him in uniform . He was a good-looking man with a nice smile . " I looked around at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a business calendar which alleged that it was still the month of June . " Where does he keep the picture of his father ? " " In plexiglass , so it does n't get worn out . " " What would wear it out ? " " Showing it to people . He also has pictures of him playing tennis , and riding a polo pony , and one at the wheel of his yacht . " " I gather his father had a lot of money ? " " Quite a lot . At least Mrs. Broadhurst has . " " And her husband walked out on it and her for the sake of a woman ? " " So I 've been told . " " Who was the woman ? " " I have no idea . Stanley and his mother do n't discuss the subject . All I know is that Mr. Broadhurst and the woman eloped to San Francisco . Stanley and I spent two weeks in San Francisco last June . Stanley tramped around the city with his pictures . He covered most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had quite a time getting him to come back with us . He wanted to quit his job and go on searching the Bay area . " " Assuming he finds his father , what then ? " " I do n't know . I do n't think Stanley knows , either . " " You said he was eleven or twelve when his father left . How long ago was that ? " " Stanley 's twenty-seven now . Fifteen years . " " Can he afford to quit his job ? " " No , he ca n't . We owe a good deal of money , to his mother and other people . But he 's getting so irresponsible , it 's all I can do to keep him on the job . " She was quiet for a moment , looking at the blank walls of the room , the calendar which had n't been changed in several months . I said : " Do you have a key to the filing cabinet ? " " No . There 's only the one , and Stanley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . He does n't like me to look at his correspondence . " " Do you think he 's been corresponding with the girl ? " " I have no idea . He gets letters from all over . I do n't open them . " " What 's her name , do you know ? " " She said her name was Sue , at least she told Ronny that . " " I 'd like to take a look at the registration of that Mercedes . What about a key to the garage ? " " That I have . I keep it in the kitchen . " I followed her out to the kitchen , where she opened a cupboard and took the key off a nail . I used it to open up the garage . The key of the Mercedes was in the ignition . There was no registration , but crumpled in the back of the clash compartment I found an auto insurance invoice made out to a Mr. Roger Armistead of io Crescent Drive in Santa  | Teresa . I copied the name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the car . " What did you find ? " Jean said . I showed her my open notebook . " Do you know Roger Armistead ? " " I 'm afraid not . Crescent Drive is a good address , though . " " And that Mercedes is worth a lot of money . Stanley 's old school friend seems to be loaded . Or else she stole it . " Jean made a quick quelling motion with her hand . " Please do n't talk so loudly . " She went on in a voice that was conscious of the neighbors beyond the grape-stake fence : " That story of his was ridiculous . She could n't possibly be his old school friend . She 's at least six or seven years younger , as I said . Besides , he attended a private boys ' school in Santa Teresa . " I flipped open my notebook again . " Give me a description of her . " " She 's a good-looking blond girl , about my height , five foot six . Nice figure . Perhaps she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shade of blue . They 're her best feature , really and also her strangest . " " Strange in what way ? " " I could n't read them , " she said . " I could n't tell if she was absolutely innocent or absolutely cold and amoral . That is n't an afterthought , either . It was my first reaction when she came in with Stanley . " " Did he give any clue as to why he brought her home with him ? " " He said she needed food and rest , and he expected me to serve her dinner . Which I did . But she hardly ate a thing a little pea soup . " " Did she talk much ? " " Not to me . She talked to Ronny . " " What about ? " 24  | " It was nonsense talk , really . She told him a wild story about a little girl who was left alone all night in a house in the mountains . Her parents were killed by monsters and the little girl was carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that had happened to her when she was his age . She asked my son if he would like it to happen to him . It was fantasy , of course , but it had an ugly element , as if she was trying to unload her hysteria on Ronny . " " What was his reaction ? Was he frightened ? " " Not exactly . He seemed to be kind of fascinated by her . I was not . I broke it up and sent him to his room . " " Did she say anything about taking him away ? " " She did n't say it directly . But that was the message , was n't it ? It scared me at the time . I should have acted on it and got rid of her . " " What scared you ? " She looked up at the sky , which was full of blowing dust . " She was afraid , I think , and I caught it from her . Of course , I was upset already . It was so unusual for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like some kind of child bride . I realized that here my life was changing , and there was nothing I could do about it . " " It 's been changing for some time , has n't it ? Since June . " Her gaze came down , full of darkened sky . " June was the month we went to San Francisco . Why do you say June ? " " It was the last month your husband tore off the calendar in his study . " A car with a noisy engine pulled up in front , and a man appeared at the corner of the house . His body seemed ill at ease in his dark rumpled suit . His long pale face had cornices of scar tissue over the eyes . He came toward us along the driveway . " Is Stanley Broadhurst here ? " " I 'm afraid he is n't , " Jean said uneasily . 25  | " Would you be Mrs. Broadhurst , by any chance ? " The man spoke with elaborate politeness , but an undertone of aggression buzzed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Broadhurst . " " When do you expect your husband back ? " " I really do n't know . " " You must have a rough idea . " " I 'm afraid I do n't . " " If you do n't , who does ? " He sounded like a man who was full of trouble . I stepped between him and Jean : " Broadhurst 's left town for the weekend . Who are you and what do you want ? " The man did n't answer me right away . He went into an intense quiet rage , swinging his hand up and slapping his own face . The blow left a four-fingered mark burning red on his cheek . " Who I am is my concern , " he said . " I want my money . You better get in touch and tell him that . I 'm blowing this town tonight and taking the money with me . " " What money are you talking about ? " " That 's between he and I. Just give him the message . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by tonight . Otherwise the sky will be the limit . Tell him that . " His cold eyes did n't believe what his mouth was saying . I guessed he was an old con . He had the prison pallor , and he appeared ill at ease in the open daylight . He was sticking close to the wall as if he needed something to contain him . " My husband does n't have that kind of money . " " His mother has . " " What do you know about his mother ? " Jean said in a thin voice . 26  | " I happen to know she 's loaded . He said he 'd get it from her today and have it for me tonight . " I said : " You 're a little early , are n't you ? " " It 's a good thing I am , with him out of town and all . " " What 's he buying from you ? " " If I told you , I could n't sell it , could I ? " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never learned the limits of his own intelligence . " Tell him I 'll be back here tonight . If he do n't pay me then , the sky 's the limit . " " There may not be anyone here then , " I said . " Why do n't you give me your name and address , and we 'll get in touch with you ? " He considered my proposal , and finally said : " You can reach me at the Star Motel . That 's below Topanga Canyon on the coast highway . Ask for Al . " I made a note of the address . " No phone ? " " You ca n't deliver money over the phone . " He gave us a dim eroded smile and went . I followed him to the corner of the house and watched him drive off in an old black Volkswagen . It had a missing front fender and a license plate so dirty I could n't read it . " Do you think he 's telling the truth ? " Jean said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to take a liedetector test to find out . And he 'd probably flunk it . " " What 's Stanley doing with that kind of person ? " " You know Stanley better than I do . " " I 'm beginning to wonder . " We went into the house , and I asked Jean 's permission to use the phone in the study again . I wanted to get in touch with the owner of the Mercedes . Santa Teresa Information gave me Armistead 's number , and I dialed it . A woman 's voice answered impatiently : " Yes ? " May I talk to Mr. Armistead ? " 27  | " He is n't here . " " Where can I find him ? " " That depends on what you want him for , " she said . " Are you Mrs. Armistead ? " " Yes . " She sounded ready to hang up on me . " I 'm trying to trace a young woman . An unnatural blond " She cut in in a much more interested voice : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Santa Teresa marina ? " " I do n't know . " " What do you know about her ? " " She was driving a green Mercedes . Apparently it 's your husband 's . " " It 's my car . It 's my yacht , too , for that matter . Did she wreck the Mercedes ? " " No . " " I want it back . Where is it ? " " I 'll tell you if you let me come and talk to you . " " Is this some kind of a shakedown ? Did Roger put you up to this ? " There was a tremolo of anger and hurt in her voice . " I 've never seen him in my life . " " Count yourself fortunate . What 's your name ? " " Archer . " " What do you do for a living , Mr. Archer ? " " I 'm a private detective . " " I see . And what do you want to talk to me about ? " " The blond girl . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No . Is she in trouble ? " " She seems to be . " " How old is she ? " " Eighteen or nineteen . " 28  | " I see , " she said in a smaller , thinner voice . " Did Roger give her the car , or was it stolen ? " " You 'll have to ask Roger . Shall I bring you the car ? " " Where are you calling from ? " " Northridge , but I 'm on my way to Santa Teresa . We can have a talk , perhaps . " There was a short silence . I asked Mrs. Armistead if she was there . " I 'm here . But I 'm not sure I want to talk to you . However , " she added in a stronger voice , " the car belongs to me and I want it back . I 'm willing to pay you , reasonably . " " We 'll discuss that when I see you . " I backed the Mercedes out of the garage and put my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the study , Jean was talking again on the phone to her mother-in-law . She set the receiver down and told me that Stanley and Ronny and the girl had visited the ranch that morning in Mrs. Broadhurst 's absence . " The gardener gave them the key to the Mountain House . " " What 's that ? " " A guest cabin in the hills back of the ranch . Where the fire is. " 29  | Before we reached Santa Teresa I could smell smoke . Then I could see it dragging like a veil across the face of the mountain behind the city . Under and through the smoke I caught glimpses of fire like the flashes of heavy guns too far away to be heard . The illusion of war was completed by an old two-engine bomber which flew in low over the mountain 's shoulder . The plane was lost in the smoke for a long instant , then climbed out trailing a pastel red cloud of fire retardant . On the freeway ahead the traffic thickened rapidly and stopped us . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided not to . The woman beside me had enough on her mind without having to listen to fire reports . At the head of the line , a highway patrolman was directing the movement of traffic from a side road onto the freeway . There were quite a few cars coming down out of the hills , many of them with Santa Teresa College decals . I noticed several trucks piled with furniture and mattresses , children and dogs . When the patrolman let us pass , we turned onto the road that led to the hills . It took us in a gradual climb between lemon groves and subdivisions toward what Jean described as Mrs. Broadhurst 's canyon . 30  | A man wearing a Forest Service jacket and a yellow hard hat stopped the Mercedes at the entrance to the canyon . Jean climbed out and introduced herself as Mrs. Broadhurst 's daughter-in-law . " I hope you 're not planning to stay , ma'am . We may have to evacuate this area . " " Have you seen my husband and little boy ? " She described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light-blue suit . He shook his head . " I 've seen a lot of people leaving with their kids . It is n't a bad idea . Once the fire starts spilling down one of these canyons she can outrace you . " " How bad is it ? " I said . " It depends on the wind . If the wind stays quiet we could get her fully contained before nightfall . We 've got a lot of equipment up on the mountain . But if she starts to blow " He lifted his hand in a kind of resigned goodbye to everything in sight . We drove into the canyon between fieldstone gate posts emblazoned with the name Canyon Estates . New and expensive houses were scattered along the canyonside among the oaks and boulders . Men and women with hoses were watering their yards and buildings and the surrounding brush . Their children were watching them , or sitting quietly in cars , ready to go . The smoke towering up from the mountain stood over them like a threat and changed the color of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fire . We went up the canyon toward it , and left the county road at Mrs. Broadhurst 's mailbox . Her private asphalt lane wound through acres of mature avocado trees . Their broad leaves were shriveling at the tips as if the fire had already touched them . Darkening fruit hung down from their branches like green hand grenades . 31  | The lane broadened into a circular drive in front of a large and simple white stucco ranchhouse . Under the deep porch , red fuchsias dripped from hanging redwood baskets . At a red glass hummingbird feeder suspended among the baskets , a hummingbird which also seemed suspended was sipping from a spout and treading air . The bird did n't move perceptibly when a woman opened the screen door and came out . She had on a white shirt and dark slacks which showed off her narrow waist . She moved across the veranda with rapid disciplined energy , making the high heels of her riding boots click . " Jean darling . " " Mother . " They shook hands briefly like competitors before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark head was touched with gray , but she was younger than I 'd imagined , no more than fifty or so . Only her eyes looked older . Without moving them from Jean 's face , she shook her head from side to side . " No , they have n't come back . And they have n't been seen in the area for some time . Who 's the blond girl ? " " I do n't know . " " Is Stanley having an affair with her ? " " I do n't know , Mother . " She turned to me . " This is Mr. Archer . " Mrs. Broadhurst nodded curtly . " Jean mentioned on the telephone that you 're some kind of detective . Is that cor-rect ? " " The private kind . " She raked me with a look that moved from my eyes down to my shoes and back up to my face again . " I 've never set much store by private detectives , frankly . But under the circumstances perhaps you can be useful . If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed the Mountain House and left it untouched . Would you like to come up there with me ? " " I would . After I your son a key to the Mountain House . He may know why they wanted it . " " He does n't . I 've questioned Fritz . We 're wasting time , and I 've already wasted a good deal . I stayed by the telephone until you and Jean got here . " " Where is Fritz ? " " You 're persistent , are n't you ? He may be in the lath house . " We left Jean standing white-faced and apprehensive in the shadow of the veranda . The lath house was in a walled garden behind one wing of the ranchhouse . Mrs. Broadhurst followed me in under the striped shadows cast by the roof . " Fritz ? Mr. Archer wants to ask you a question . " A soft-looking man in dungarees straightened up from the plants he was tending . He had emotional green eyes and a skittish way of holding his body , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a livid scar connecting his mouth and his nose which looked as if he had been born with a harelip . " What is it this time ? " he said . " I 'm trying to find out what Stanley Broadhurst is up to . Why do you think he wanted the key to the guest house ? " Fritz shrugged his thick loose shoulders . " I do n't know . I ca n't read people 's minds , can I ? " " You must have some idea . " He glanced uncomfortably at Mrs. Broadhurst . " Am I supposed to spit it all out ? " j , " Please tell the truth , " she said in a forced tone . " Well , naturally I thought him and the chick had hanky-33  | panky in mind . Why else would they want to go up there ? " " With my grandson along ? " Mrs. Broadhurst said . " They wanted me to keep the boy with me . But I did n't want the responsibility . That 's the way you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You did n't mention that before . You should have told me , Fritz . " " I ca n't remember everything at once , can I ? " " How was the boy behaving ? " I asked him . " Okay . He did n't say much . " " Neither do you . " " What do you want me to say ? You think I did something to the boy ? " His voice rose , and his eyes grew moist and suddenly overflowed . " Nobody suggested anything like that . " " Then why do you keep at me and at me ? The boy was here with his father . His father took him away . Does that make me responsible ? " " Take it easy . " Mrs. Broadhurst touched my arm . " We 're getting nowhere . " We left the gardener complaining among his plants . The striped shadow fell from the roof , jailbirding him . The carport was attached to an old red barn at the back of the house . Below the barn was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was thickly grown with oaks and eucalyptus . Band-tailed pigeons and sweet-voiced redwinged blackbirds were foraging under the trees and around a feeder . I stepped on fallen eucalyptus pods which looked like ornate bronze nailheads set in the dust . An aging Cadillac and an old pickup truck stood under the carport . Mrs. Broadhurst drove the pickup , wrestling it angrily around the curves in the avocado grove and turning 34  | left on the road toward the mountains . Beyond the avocados were ancient olive trees , and beyond them was pasture gone to brush . We were approaching the head of the canyon . The smell of burning grew stronger in my nostrils . I felt as though we were going against nature , but I did n't mention my qualms to Mrs. Broadhurst . She was n't the sort of woman you confessed human weakness to . The road degenerated as we climbed . It was narrow and inset with boulders . Mrs. Broadhurst jerked at the wheel of the truck as if it was a male animal resisting control . For some reason I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone , and I asked Mrs. Broadhurst if she knew the woman . She answered shortly : " I 've seen her at the beach club . Why do you ask ? " " The Armistead name came up in connection with your son 's friend , the blond girl . " " How ? " " She was using their Mercedes . " " I 'm not surprised at the connection . The Armisteads are nouveaux riches from down southnot my kind of people . " Without really changing the subject , she went on : " We 've lived here for quite a long time , you know . My grandfather Falconer 's ranch took in a good part of the coastal plain and the whole mountainside , all the way to the top of the first range . All I have left is a few hundred acres . " While I was trying to think of an appropriate comment , she said in a more immediate voice : " Stanley phoned me last night and asked me for fifteen hundred dollars cash , today . " " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buying information . As you may or may not know , my son is somewhat hipped on 35  | the subject of his father 's desertion . " Her voice was dry and careful . " His wife told me that . " " Did she ? It occurred to me that the fifteen hundred dollars might have something to do with you . " " It does n't . " I thought of Al , the pale man in the dark suit , but decided not to bring him up right now . " Who 's paying you ? " the woman said rather sharply . " I have n't been paid . " " I see . " She sounded as if she distrusted what she saw . " Are you and my daughter-in-law good friends ? " " I met her this morning . We have friends in common . " " Then you probably know that Stanley and she have been close to breaking up . I never did think that their marriage would last . " " Why ? " " Jean is an intelligent girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't believe she 's ever understood my son , though I 've tried to explain something about our family traditions . " She turned her head from the road to glance at me . " Is Stanley really interested in this blond girl ? " " Obviously he is , but maybe not in the way you mean . He would n't have brought your grandson along " " Do n't be too sure of that . He brought Ronny because he knows I love the boy , and because he wants money from me . Remember when he found I was n't here , he tried to leave Ronny with Fritz . I 'd give a lot to know what they 're up to . " 36  | At the base of a sandstone bluff where the road petered out entirely , she stopped the pickup and we got out . " This is where we shift to shanks ' mare , " she said . " Ordinarily we could have driven around by way of Rattlesnake Road , but that 's where they 're fighting the fire . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wooden sign , " Falconer Trail . " The trail was a dusty track bulldozed out of the steep side of the canyon . As Mrs. Broadhurst went up ahead of me , she explained that her father had given the land for the trail to the Forest Service . She sounded as if she was trying to cheer herself in any way she could . I ate her dust until I was looking down into the tops of the tallest sycamores in the canyon below . A daytime moon hung over the bluff , and we went on climbing toward it . When we reached the top I was wet under my clothes . About a hundred yards back from the edge , a large weathered redwood cabin stood against a grove of trees . Some of the trees had been blackened and maimed where the fire had burned an erratic swath through the grove . The cabin itself was partly red and looked as if it had been splashed with blood . Beyond the trees was a black hillside where the fire had 37  | browsed . The hillside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ridge to where the fire was now . It seemed to be moving laterally across the face of the mountain . The flames that from a distance had looked like artillery flashes were crashing through the thick chaparral like cavalry . The ridge road was about midway between us and the main body of the fire . Toward the east , where the foothills flattened out into a mesa , the road curved down toward a collection of buildings which looked like a small college . Between them and the fire , bulldozers were crawling back and forth on the face of the mountain , cutting a firebreak in the deep brush . The road was clogged with tanker trucks and other heavy equipment . Men stood around them in waiting attitudes , as if by behaving modestly and discreetly they could make the fire stay up on the mountain and die there , like an unwanted god . As Mrs. Broadhurst and I approached the cabin I could see that part of its walls and roof had been splashed from the air with red fire retardant . The rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weathered gray . The door was hanging open , with the key in the Yale lock . Mrs. Broadhurst walked up to it slowly , as if she dreaded what she might find inside . But there was nothing unusual to be seen in the big rustic front room . The ashes in the stone fireplace were cold , and might have been cold for years . Pieces of old-fashioned furniture draped with canvas stood around like formless images of the past . Mrs. Broadhurst sat down heavily on a canvas-covered armchair . Dust rose around her . She coughed and spoke in a different voice , low and ashamed : " I came up the trail a little too fast , I 'm afraid . " 38  | I went out to the kitchen to get her some water . There were cups in the cupboard , but when I turned on the tap in the tin sink no water came . The butane stove was disconnected , too . I walked through the other rooms while I was at it : two downstairs bedrooms and a sleeping loft which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lit by a dormer window , and there were three beds in it , covered with canvas . One of them looked rumpled . I stripped the canvas off it . On the heavy gray blanket underneath there was a Rorschach blot of blood which looked recent but not fresh . I went down to the big front room . Mrs. Broadhurst had rested her head against the back of the chair . Her closed face was smooth and peaceful , and she was snoring gently . I heard the rising roar of a plane coming in low over the mountain . I went out the back door in time to see its red spoor falling on the fire . The plane grew smaller , its roar diminuendoed . Two deera doe and a fawncame down the slope in a dry creek channel , heading for the grove . They saw me and rockinghorsed over a fallen log into the trees . From the rear of the cabin a washed-out gravel lane overgrown with weeds meandered toward the ridge road . Starting along the lane toward the trees , I noticed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stable . The wheel tracks looked new , and I could see only one set of them . I followed them to the stable and peered in . A black convertible that looked like Stanley 's stood there with the top down . I found the registration in the dash compartment . It was Stanley 's all right . I slammed the door of the convertible . A noise that sounded like an echo or a response came from the direction of the trees . Perhaps it was the crack of a stick breaking . I 39  | went out and headed for the partly burned grove . All I could hear was the sound of my own footsteps and a faint sighing which came from the wind in the trees . Then I made out a more distant noise which I did n't recognize . It sounded like the whirring of wings . I felt hot wind on my face , and glanced up the slope . The wall of smoke that hung above the fire was leaning out from the mountain . At its base the fire was burning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were leaping down the slope to the left , and firemen were moving along the ridge road to meet them . The wind was changing . I could hear it rattling now among the leavesthe same sound that had wakened me in West Los Angeles early that morning . There were human noises , toosounds of movement among the trees . " Stanley ? " I said . A man in a blue suit , and a red hard hat stepped out from behind the blotched trunk of a sycamore . He was a big man , and he moved with a kind of clumsy lightness . " Looking for somebody ? " He had a quiet cool voice , which gave the effect of holding itself in reserve . " Several people . " " I 'm the only one around , " he said pleasantly . His heavy arms and thighs bulged through his business clothes . His face was wet , and there was dirt on his shoes . He took off his hard hat , wiping his face and forehead with a bandana handkerchief . His hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cannonball . I walked toward him , into the skeletal shadow of the sycamore . The smoky moon was lodged in its top , segmented by small black branches . With a quick conjurer 's motion , the big man produced a pack of cigarettes from his breast pocket and thrust it toward me . " Smoke ? " 40  | " No thanks . I do n't smoke . " " Do n't smoke cigarettes , you mean ? " " I gave them up . " " What about cigars ? " " I never liked them , " I said . " Are you taking a poll ? " " You might call it that . " He smiled broadly , revealing several gold teeth . " How about cigarillos ? Some people smoke them instead of cigarettes . " " I 've noticed that . " " These people you say you 're looking for , do any of them smoke cigarillos ? " " I do n't think so . " Then I remembered that Stanley Broadhurst did . " Why ? " " No reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mountainside . " That fire is starting to move . I do n't like the feel of the wind . It has the feel of a Santa Ana . " " It was blowing down south early this morning . " " So I 've heard . Are you from Los Angeles ? " " That 's right . " He seemed to have all the time he needed , but I was tired of fooling around with him . " My name is Archer . I 'm a licensed private detective , employed by the Broadhurst family . " " I was wondering . I saw you come out of the stable . " " Stanley Broadhurst 's car is in there . " " I know , " he said . " Is Stanley Broadhurst one of the people you 're looking for ? " " Yes , he is . " " License ? " I showed him my photostat . " Well , I may be able to help you . " He turned abruptly and moved in among the trees along a rutted trail . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my feet that it was like walking on cornflakes . We came to an opening in the trees . The big sycamore 41  | which partly overarched it had been burned . Smoke was still rising from its charred branches and from the undergrowth behind it . Near the middle of the open space there was a hole in the ground between three and four feet in diameter . A spade stood upright beside it in a pile of dirt and stones . Off to one side of the pile , a pickax lay on the ground . Its sharp tip seemed to have been dipped in dark red paint . Reluctantly I looked down into the hole . In its shallow depth a man 's body lay curled like a foetus , face upturned . I recognized his peppermint-striped shirt , glad rags to be buried in . And in spite of the dirt that stuffed his open mouth and clung to his eyes , I recognized Stanley Broadhurst , and I said so . The big man absorbed the information quietly . " What was he doing here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't . But I believe this is part of his family 's ranch . You have n't explained what you 're doing here . " " I 'm with the Forest Service . My name 's Joe Kelsey , I 'm trying to find out what started this fire . And , " he added deliberately , " I think I have found out . It seems to have flared up in this immediate area . I came across this , right there . " He indicated a yellow plastic marker stuck in the burned-over ground a few feet from where we were standing . Then he produced a small aluminum evidence case and snapped it open . It contained a single half-burned cigarillo . " Did Broadhurst smoke these ? " " I saw him smoke one this morning . You 'll probably find the package in his clothes . " " Yeah , but I did n't want to move him until the coroner sees him . It looks as if I may have to , though . " He squinted uphill toward the fire . It blazed like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of men fighting it looked small and futile in spite of their 42  | tanker trucks and bulldozers . Off to the left the fire had spilled over the ridge and was pouring downhill like fuming acid eating the dry brush . Its smoke blew ahead of it and spread across the city toward the sea . Kelsey took the spade and started to throw dirt into the hole , talking as he worked . " I hate to bury a man twice , but it 's better than letting him get roasted . The fire 's coming back this way . " " Was he buried when you found him ? " " That 's correct . But whoever buried him did n't do much of a job of covering up . I found the spade and the pick with the blood on itand then the filled hole with loose dirt around . So I started digging . I did n't know what I was going to find . But I sort of had a feeling that it would be a dead man with a hole in his head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ striped shirt and his upturned insulted face . Kelsey spoke to me over his shoulder : " You mentioned that you were looking for several people . Who are the others ? " " The dead man 's little boy is one . And there was a blond girl with him . " " So I 've heard . Can you describe her ? " " Blue eyes , five foot six , 115 pounds , age about eighteen . Broadhurst 's widow can tell you more about her . She 's at the ranchhouse . " " Where 's your car ? I came out on a fire truck . " I told him that Stanley 's mother had brought me in her pickup , and that she was in the cabin . Kelsey stopped spading dirt . His face was running with sweat , and mildly puzzled . " What 's she doing in there ? " " Resting . " " We 're going to have to interrupt her rest . " 43  | Beyond the grove , in the unburned brush , the fire had grown almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spurts and felt like hot animal breath . We ran away from it , with Kelsey carrying the spade and me carrying the bloody pick . The pick felt heavy by the time we reached the door of the cabin . I set it down and knocked on the door before I went in . Mrs. Broadhurst sat up with a start . Her face was rosy . Sleep clung to her eyes and furred her voice : " I must have dozed off , forgive me , but I had the sweetest dream . I spentwe spent our honeymoon here , you know , right in this cabin . It was during the war , quite early in the war , and traveling was n't possible . I dreamed that I was on my honeymoon , and none of the bad things had happened . " Her half-dreaming eyes focused on my face and recognized the signs , which I could n't conceal , of another bad thing that had happened . Then she saw Kelsey with the spade in his hands . He looked like a giant gravedigger blocking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression , competent and cool and rather strained , forced itself down over her open face . She got up very quickly , and almost lost her balance . " Mr. Kelsey ? It 's Mr. Kelsey , is n't it ? What 's hap-pened ? " " We found your son , ma'am . " " Where is he ? I want to talk to him . " Kelsey said in deep embarrassment : " I 'm afraid that wo n't be possible , ma'am . " " Why ? Has he gone somewhere ? " Kelsey gave me an appealing look . Mrs. Broadhurst walked toward him . " What are you doing with that spade ? That 's my spade , is n't it ? " " I would n't know , ma'am . " 44  | She took it out of his hands . " It most certainly is . I bought it for my own use last spring . Where did you get hold of it , from my gardener ? " " I found it in the clump of trees yonder . " Kelsey gestured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing there ? " Kelsey 's mouth opened and shut . He was unwilling or afraid to tell her that Stanley was dead . I moved toward her and told her that her son had been killed , probably with a pickax . I stepped outside and showed her the pickax . " Is this yours , too ? " She looked at it dully . " Yes , I believe it is . " Her voice was a low monotone , hardly more than a whisper . She turned and began to run toward the burning trees , stumbling in her high-heeled riding boots . Kelsey ran after her , heavily and rapidly like a bear . He took her around the waist and lifted her off her feet and turned her around away from the fire . She kicked and shouted : " Let me go . I want my son . " " He 's in a hole in the ground , ma'am . You ca n't go in there now , nobody can . But his body wo n't burn , it 's safe underground . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He dropped her . She fell in the brown weeds , beating at the ground and crying that she wanted her son . I got down on my knees beside her and talked her into getting up and coming with us . We went down the trail in single file , with Kelsey leading the way and Mrs. Broadhurst between us . I stayed close behind her , in case she tried to do something wild like throwing herself down the side of the bluff . She moved passively with her head down , like a prisoner between guards . 45  | Kelsey carried the spade in one hand and the bloody pickax in the other . He tossed them into the back of the truck and helped Mrs. Broadhurst into the cab . I took the wheel . She rode between us in silence , looking straight ahead along the stony road . She did n't utter a sound until we turned at her mailbox into the avocado grove . Then she let out a gasp which sounded as if she 'd been holding her breath all the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " We do n't know , " Kelsey said . " You mean that he 's dead , too . Is that what you mean ? " Kelsey took refuge in a southwestern drawl which helped to soften his answer . " I mean that nobody 's seen hide nor hair of him , ma'am . " " What about the blond girl ? Where is she ? " " I only wish I knew . " " Did she kill my son ? " " It looks like it , ma'am . It looks like she hit him over the head with that pickax . " " And buried him ? " " He was buried when I found him . " " How could a girl do that ? " " It was a shallow grave , ma'am . Girls can do about anything boys can do when they set their minds to it . " 46  | A whine had entered Kelsey 's drawl under the pressure of her questioning and the greater pressure of her fear . Impatiently she turned to me : " Mr. Archer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I said it with some force , to beat back the possibility that he was . " Has that girl abducted him ? " " It 's a good assumption to work on . But they may simply have run away from the fire . " " You know that is n't so . " She sounded as if she had crossed a watershed in her life , beyond which nothing good could happen . I stopped the pickup behind my car on the driveway . Kelsey got out and offered to help Mrs. Broadhurst . She pushed his hands away . But she climbed out like a woman overtaken by sudden age . " You can park the truck in the carport , " she said to me . " I do n't like to leave it out in the sun . " " Excuse me , " Kelsey said , " but you might as well leave it out here . The fire 's coming down the canyon , and it may get to your house . I 'll help you bring your things out if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Broadhurst cast a slow look around at the house and its surroundings . " There 's never been fire in this canyon in my lifetime . " " That means it 's ripe , " he said . " The brush up above is fifteen and twenty feet deep , and as dry as a chip . This is a fifty-year fire . It could take your house unless the wind changes again . " " Then let it . " Jean came to meet us at the door , a little tardily , as if she dreaded what we were going to say . I told her that her husband was dead and that her son was missing . The two women exchanged a questioning look , as if each of them was 47  | looking into the other for the source of all their troubles . Then they came together in the doorway and stood in each other 's arms . Kelsey came up behind me on the porch . He tipped his hard hat and spoke to the younger woman , who was facing him over Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes . " " I understand you can give me a description of the girl who was with your husband . " " I can try . " She separated herself from the older woman , who went into the house . Jean rested on the railing near the hummingbird feeder . A hummingbird buzzed her . She moved to the other side of the porch and sat on a canvas chair , leaning forward in a strained position and repeating for Kelsey her description of the blue-eyed blond girl with the strange eyes . " And you say she 's eighteen or so ? " Jean nodded . Her reactions were quick but mechanical , as if her mind was focused somewhere else . " Iswas your husband interested in her , Mrs. Broad-hurst ? " " Obviously he was , " she said in a dry bitter voice . " But I gathered she was more interested in my son . " " Interested in what way ? " " I do n't know what way . " Kelsey switched to a less sensitive line of questioning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had on a sleeveless yellow dress . I did n't see her this morning . " " I did , " I put in . " She was still wearing the yellow dress . I assume you 'll be giving all this to the police . " 48  | " Yessir , I will . Right now I want to talk to the gardener . He may be able to tell us how that spade and pick got up on the mountain . What 's his name ? " " Frederick Snowwe call him Fritz , " Jean said . " He is n't here . " " Where is he ? " " He rode Stanley 's old bicycle down the road about half an hour ago , when the wind changed . He wanted to take the Cadillac , but I told him not to . " " Does n't he have a car of his own ? " " I believe he has some kind of jalopy . " " Where is it ? " She shrugged slightly . " I do n't know . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't tell you . He seems to have been the only one here for most of the morning . " Kelsey 's face saddened . " How does he get along with your little boy ? " " Fine . " Then his meaning entered her eyes and darkened them . She shook her head as if to deny the meaning , dislodge the darkness . " Fritz would n't hurt Ronny , he 's always been kind to him . " " Then why did he take off ? " " He said that he was worried about his mother . But I think he was scared of the fire . He was almost crying . " " So am I scared of the fire , " Kelsey said . " It 's why I 'm in this business . " " Are you a policeman ? " Jean said . " Is that why you 're asking me all these questions ? " " I 'm with the Forest Service , assigned to investigate the causes of fires . " He dug into an inside pocket , produced the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Does this look like one of your husband 's ? " 49  | " Yes it does . But surely you 're not trying to prove that he started it . What 's the point if he 's dead ? " Her voice had risen a little out of control . " The point is this . Whoever killed him probably made him drop this in the dry grass . That means they 're legally and financially responsible for the fire . And it 's my job to establish the facts . Where does this man Snow live ? " " With his mother . I think their house is quite near here . My mother-in-law can tell you . Mrs. Snow used to work for her . " We found Mrs. Broadhurst in the living room , standing at a corner window which framed the canyon . The room was so large that she looked small at the far end of it . She did n't turn when we moved up to her . She was watching the progress of the fire . It was in the head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volcano , and spouting smoke and sparks above the treetops . The eucalyptus trees behind the house were momentarily blanched by the gusty wind . The blackbirds and pigeons had all gone . Kelsey and I exchanged glances . It was time that we went , too . I let him do the talking , since it was his territory and his kind of emergency . He addressed the woman 's unmoving back : " Mrs. Broadhurst ? Do n't you think we better get out of here ? " " You go . Please do go . I 'm staying , for the present . " " You ca n't do that . That fire is really on its way . " She turned on him . Her face had sunk on its bones ; it made her look old and formidable . " Do n't tell me what I can or ca n't do . I was born in this house . I 've never lived anywhere else . If the house goes , I might as well go with it . Everything else has gone . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Am I not ? " " You do n't want to get yourself burned , do you ? " " I think I 'd almost welcome the flames . I 'm very cold , Mr. Kelsey . " Her tone was tragic , but there was a note of hysteria running through it , or something worse . A stubbornness which could mean that her mind had slipped a notch , and stuck at a crazy angle . Kelsey cast a desperate look around the room . It was full of Victorian furniture , with dark Victorian portraits on the walls , and several cabinets full of stuffed native birds under glass . " Do n't you want to save your things , ma'am ? Your silver and bird specimens and pictures and mementos ? " She spread her hands in a hopeless gesture as if everything had long since run through them . Kelsey was getting nowhere trying to sell her back the pieces of her life . I said : " We need your help , Mrs. Broadhurst . " She looked at me in mild surprise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is a bad time and place for a little boy to be lost " " It 's a judgment on me . " " That 's nonsense . " " SG I 'm talking nonsense , am I ? " I disregarded her angry question . " Fritz the gardener may know where he is . I believe you know his mother . Is that correct ? " Her answer came slowly . " Edna Snow used to be my housekeeper . You ca n't seriously believe that Fritz " she stopped , unwilling to put her question into words . " It would be a great help if you 'd come along and talk to Fritz and his mother . " " Very well , I will . " 5Z  | We drove out the lane like a funeral cortege . Mrs. Broadhurst was leading in her Cadillac . Jean and I came next in the green Mercedes . Kelsey brought up the rear , driving the pickup . I looked back from the mailbox . Sparks and embers were blowing down the canyon , plunging into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place of the birds that had flown . The residential district called Canyon Estates had been almost depopulated . A few men were up on their roofs with running hoses and defiant expressions . Two roads crossed at the mouth of the canyon , and Mrs. Broadhurst took the right-hand turn . The neighborhood changed abruptly . Black and Chicano children stood beside the road and watched us go by as if we were a procession of foreign dignitaries . Mrs. Snow lived in an old stucco cottage on a street of old stucco cottages made almost beautiful by flowering jacaranda trees . Kelsey and I and Mrs. Broadhurst went to the door . Jean stayed in the Mercedes . " I do n't trust myself , " she said . Mrs. Snow was a quick-moving gray-haired woman wearing a fussy black outfit which looked as if she had dressed 52  | for the occasion . The eyes behind her rimless spectacles were dark , and hardened by anxiety . " Mrs. Broadhurst ! What brings you here ? " Her voice hurried on as if she did n't really want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . Wo n't you come in ? " The door opened directly into the meager front room , and we went in . Mrs. Broadhurst introduced Kelsey and me . But Mrs. Snow 's scared eyes refused to look at us , resisting the notion that we were there at all . Which left her only Mrs. Broadhurst to deal with . " Can I get you something , Mrs. Broadhurst ? A nice cup of tea ? " " No thanks . Where 's Fritz ? " " I believe he 's in his room . The poor boy is n't feeling too well . " " He is n't a boy , " Mrs. Broadhurst said . His mother corrected her . " He is , emotionally . The doctor said he 's emotionally immature . " She glanced quickly at Kelsey and me to see if we were picking this up . I sensed the beginning of a psychiatric copout . " Get him out here , " Mrs. Broadhurst said . " But he is n't up to facing people now . He 's terribly upset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 's always been afraid of fire . " She gave Kelsey and me another seeking look . " Are you gentlemen from the police ? " " More or less , " I said . " I 'm a detective . Mr. Kelsey is investigating the fire for the Forest Service . " " I see . " Her small body seemed to grow smaller and at the same time denser and heavier . " I do n't know what kind of trouble Frederick is in , but I can assure you he is n't responsible . " 53  | " What kind of trouble is he in ? " Kelsey said . " I 'm sure you know , or you would n't be here . I do n't . " " Then how do you know that he 's in trouble ? " " I 've been looking after him for thirty-five years . " Her look turned inward , as if she was registering each of the thirty-five years and each of her son 's troubles . Mrs. Broadhurst stood up . " We 're wasting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his room , we 'll go in and talk to him there . I want to know where my grandson is . " " Your grandson ? " The little woman was appalled . " Has something happened to Ronald ? " " He 's missing . And Stanley is dead . He was buried with my spade . " Mrs. Snow put her fingers to her mouth . A gold wedding band was sunk in the flesh of one finger like a scar . " Buried in the garden ? " " No . At the top of the canyon . " " And you think Frederick did this ? " " I do n't know . " I said : " We were hoping your son could help us . " " I see . " Her face brightened surprisingly , like the lights just before a power failure . " Why do n't I ask him ? He is n't afraid of meI can get more out of him . " Mrs. Broadhurst shook her head and started for the door that opened into the back of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intercepted her , backing into the doorway and talking quickly . " Do n't go into his room , please . It has n't been cleaned , and Frederick is n't himself . He 's in a bad state . " Mrs. Broadhurst spoke in a guttural voice : " So is Stanley . So are we all . " For the second or third time , she lost her balance and staggered a little . Her mouth was pulled to one side in a half-grin which seemed to call attention to some secret joke . 54  | Mrs. Snow , who moved and changed like mercury , was at her side in a moment , taking her arm and helping her into an old platform rocker . " You 're feeling faint , " she said . " And I do n't wonder , if all these things are true . I 'll get you a glass of water . Or would you like a cup of tea after all ? " She sounded genuinely concerned . But I suspected she was also a master of delaying tactics . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along with her . I pushed through the door into the kitchen and called her son by name . A muffled answer came through a further door which opened off the kitchen . I knocked on it and looked in . The air in the room smelled sweet and rotten . All I could see at first were the narrow shafts of sunlight that came through the hole in the blind drawn over the window . They were thrust across the room like the swords of a magician probing a basket to demonstrate that his partner had disappeared . As if he would like to disappear indeed , the gardener crouched in the corner of the iron bed with his feet pulled up under him . " I 'm sorry to bother you , Fritz . " " That 's all right . " His voice was hopeless . I sat down on the foot of the bed facing him . " Did you take the spade and the pickax up the canyon ? " " Up the canyon ? " he asked . " To the Mountain House . Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered his answer and finally said : " No . " " Do you know who did ? " " No . " But his eyes shifted away from mine . He was a poor liar . Moving as softly as a shadow , Kelsey appeared in the doorway . His large face was empty and waiting . " The spade and pickax , " I said to Fritz , " were used to bury 55  | Stanley Broadhurst this morning . If you know who took the spade and pickax , you probably know who killed Stanley . " He shook his head so hard that his face blurred . " He took them himself , when he came to get the key . He put them in the back of his convertible . " " Is that true , Fritz ? " " Cross my heart and hope to die . " He crossed his breast with his finger . " Why did n't you tell us before about the spade and the pickax ? " " He told me not to . " " Stanley Broadhurst told you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profoundly . " He gave me a dollar and made me promise not to . " " Did he say why ? " " He did n't have to . He 's afraid of his mother . She does n't like people messing with her garden tools . " " Did he tell you what he wanted the tools for ? " " He said that he was going to dig for arrowheads . " " Did you believe him ? " " Yessir . " " And then he drove up the mountain in his car ? " " Yessir . " " With the blond girl and the little boy ? " " Yessir . " " Did the girl say anything to you ? " " No sir . Not then . " " What do you mean , not then ' ? Did she talk to you some other time ? " " No sir . She never did . " But his eyes shifted away again . He peered at the swords of light thrust through the chinks in the blind as if they were in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 56  | " When did you see her again , Fritz ? " He was perfectly silent for a while . His eyes were the only living things in the room . His mother appeared in the doorway behind Kelsey . " You have no right in there , " she said to me . " You 're violating his legal rights and nothing that he says can be used against him . In addition to which he 's non compos , and I can prove it over and over with medical facts . " " You 're assuming he 's done something wrong , Mrs. Snow , " I said . " You mean he has n't ? " " Not that I know of . Please go away and let me talk to him . He 's a very important witness . " She gave her son a sad dubious look , which he returned . But she backed away into the kitchen . Then I heard water running in a pan , and a gas burner blooping on . " Did the girl come back , Fritz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Around noon , or a little later . I was eating my lunch . " " What did she say ? " " She said Ronny was hungry . I gave him a half of a peanut butter sandwich . I gave her the other half . " 57  | " Did she mention Stanley Broadhurst ? " " No . I did n't ask her . But she was scared . " " Did she say so ? " " She did n't have to say so . I can tell . The boy was scared , too . I can tell . " " What happened after that ? " " Nothing . She went away down the canyon . " " On foot ? " " Yeah . " But his eyes were avoiding mine again . " Are you sure she did n't take your car ? " His head sank lower . He sat perfectly still like a yogi studying the center of his body . " All right . She took my car . They drove away in my car . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I never thought of it . I was fertilizingI had a lot on my mind . " " Come off it , Fritz . The boy is gone and his father is dead . " " I did n't kill him ! " " I think I believe you . Not everybody will . " He lifted his head and looked past Kelsey . His mother was moving around in the kitchen . He listened to the sounds she made , as if they might tell him what to say and think . " Forget about your mother , Fritz . This is between you and me . " " Close the door then . I do n't want her to hear me . Or him either . " Kelsey stepped back out of the doorway and closed the door . I said to Fritz : " Did you let her take your car ? " " Yeah . She said Mr. Broadhurst wanted her to have it . " " There 's more to it than that , Fritz , is n't there ? " Shame suffused his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a loose hand toward the kitchen . " Do n't tell her what ? " I said . 58  | " She let me touch her . " The memory , or the fantasy , shuddered through him . His scarred mouth smiled , leaving his eyes still sad . " I mean , she looked like a girl I used to know . " " And you let her take your car . " " She said she 'd bring it back . But , " he added in a grieved tone , " she never did yet . " " Did she say where she was going ? " " No . " He sat for a moment in a listening attitude . " I heard her drive down the canyon . " " And the boy was with her ? " " Yessir . She made him go along with her . " " Did n't he want to go ? " " No . " He shook his head furiously , as if he were the boy himself . " But she made him . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bogy man would get him . She picked him up and put him on the seat and drove away with him . " I got out my notebook and pen . " What kind of a car is it ? " " 1953 Chevrolet sedan . She still runs good . " " What color ? " " It 's partly the same old blue and partly red primer . I started to paint her , but I got too busy . " " License ? " " You better ask my mother . She keeps track of everything around here . But do n't tell her . " He touched his mouth . I went out into the kitchen . Mrs. Snow was at the gas stove , pouring boiling water into a brown teapot . The steam had clouded her glasses , and she turned to me in blank apprehension like a blind woman taken by surprise . " The girl took your son 's car . " She set down the teakettle with a crash . " I knew he did something wrong . " " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can give me the license number we 'll put out an alarm . " 59  | " What will they do to Frederick ? " " Nothing . Can you give me the license number ? " She rummaged in a kitchen drawer , found an old leatherette memorandum book , and read aloud from it : " IKT 447 . " I wrote down the number . Then I returned to the front room and reported to Kelsey . Mrs. Broadhurst was slumped in the platform rocker . Her color was high and her eyes were partly closed . " Has she been drinking ? " I asked Kelsey . " Not that I know of . " Mrs. Broadhurst sighed , and made an effort to get up . She fell back onto the platform rocker , which creaked under her weight . Mrs. Snow backed through the doorway from the kitchen . She was balancing a tray which held the brown teapot , containers of milk and sugar , and a bone-china cup and saucer which looked as if they had been worn thin . She set the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled the teacup from the pot . I could see the dark tea rising through the cup . She spoke to Mrs. Broadhurst with forced cheerfulness : " A spot of tea is good for whatever ails you . It will clear your brain and pep you up . I know just how you like it , with milk and sugaris n't that right ? " Mrs. Broadhurst said in a thick voice : " You 're very kind . " She reached for the teacup . Her arm swung wide and loose , sweeping the teacup and the milk and sugar off the tray . Mrs. Snow got down on her knees and gathered the pieces of the broken cup as if it was a religious object . She darted into the kitchen for a towel and blotted up some of the tea from the threadbare carpet . Kelsey had lifted Mrs. Broadhurst by the shoulders and kept her from falling out of the chair . " Who 's her doctor ? " I asked Mrs. Snow . 6o  | " Dr. Jerome . Do you want me to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call him yourself . " " What shall I say is the matter ? " " I do n't know . It could be a heart attack . Maybe you better call an ambulance , too . " Mrs. Snow stood motionless for a second , as if all her responses had been used up . Then she went back into the kitchen . I heard her dialing . I was getting restless . The missing boy was the main thing , and he was long gone by now . I gave Kelsey the license number of the gardener 's old car and suggested that he put out an all-points on it . He called the sheriff 's office . I went outside . Jean was pacing back and forth on the broken sidewalk . Her short skirt and her long white legs gave her a harlequin aspect , like a sad clown caught on a poor street under a smoky sky . " What on earth is going on in there ? " I told her what the gardener had told me and added that her mother-in-law was ill . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " She is now . We 're getting an ambulance for her . " As I spoke , I could hear it coming in the distance like the memory of a scream . " What am I going to do ? " Jean said , as if the ambulance was coming for her . " Go with Mrs. Broadhurst to the hospital . " " Where are you going ? " " I do n't know yet . " " I 'd rather go with you . " I did n't know exactly what she meant , and neither , I thought , did she . I gave her my business card and an allpurpose answer : " We 'll keep in touch . Let my answering service know where you 're staying . " 6z  | She looked at the card as if it was in a foreign language . " You 're quitting on me , are n't you ? " " No . I 'm not . " " Do you want money , is that it ? " " It can wait . " " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing . " She looked at me as if she knew better . People always wanted something . The ambulance turned the corner . Its animal scream sank to a growl before it stopped in the road . " This the Snow residence ? " the driver called . I said it was . He and his partner took a stretcher into the house and came out with Mrs. Broadhurst on it . As they lifted her into the back of the ambulance , she tried to sit up . " Who pushed me ? " " Nobody , dearie , " the driver said . " We 'll give you a sniff of oxygen and that 'll perk you up . " Jean said without looking at me : " I 'll follow along in her car . I ca n't let her go to the hospital by herself . " I decided it was time to deliver the green Mercedes to Mrs. Roger Armistead . Kelsey pointed out Crescent Drive , on the first ridge overlooking the city . There was smoke above it , pre-empting most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes still crinkled by the long look he had taken . " Be careful if you 're going up that way . The fire is still on the move . " I said I would be careful . " Can I drop you anywhere ? " " No thanks . I can use the pickup to get downtown . But first I want to do some further checking on Fritz . " " Do n't you believe him ? " " Up to a point I do . But you never get all the facts on the first go-round. " 62  | He went back toward the house . Mrs. Snow was standing framed in the doorway like a faded vestal virgin guarding a shrine . On my way up to Crescent Drive I punched on the car radio . It was tuned to a local station which was broadcasting continuous fire reports . The Rattlesnake Fire , as the announcer called it , was threatening the northeastern side of the city . Hundreds of residents were being evacuated . Smoke-jumpers were being flown in and additional firefighting equipment was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blowing , the announcer said , Rattlesnake might strike across the city all the way to the sea . The Armistead house , like the Broadhurst house , was in debatable territory . I parked in the courtyard beside a black Continental . The fire was so close that I could sense its fibrillation when the engine died . Ashes like scant gray snow were sifting down onto the blacktop in the courtyard . I could hear water gushing somewhere at the rear . The house was white and one-storied , set like a classical temple against a grove of cypress trees . It was so nicely proportioned that I did n't realize how big it was until I hiked around it to the back . I passed a fifty-foot swimming pool at the bottom of which lay a blue mink coat , like the 63  | headless pelt of a woman , anchored by what looked like jewel boxes . A tanned woman with short gray hair was spraying the cypresses with a hose . Beyond the cypresses , in the dry brush , a dark-haired man in dungarees was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spade . The woman was talking to the fire as if it was a crazy man or a wild dog " Get back , you crummy bastard ! " and she turned to me almost gaily when I called her name . " Mrs. Armistead ? " I saw when she turned that her gray hair was premature . Her face was a hot brown , cooled by slanting green eyes . Her body was elegant in a white slack-suit . " Who are you ? " " Archer . I brought your Mercedes . " " Good . I 'll send you a check , provided the car 's in good shape . " " It is , and I 'll send you a bill . " " In that case you might as well help out here . " Her downward smile made a white gash in her face . She gestured toward a spade which lay on brown cypress needles under the trees . " You could help Carlos dig that ditch . " It sounded like a poor idea . I was in city clothes . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and went through the trees to help Carlos . He was a sawed-off middle-aged Chicano who took my arrival as a matter of course . I worked behind him , broadening and deepening his furrow . It was almost certainly hopeless , a token scratch in the dirt across the base of the chaparral-covered hill . I could hear the fire very plainly now , breathing on the far side of the hill . Behind me the wind was soughing in the cypresses. 64  | " Where 's Mr. Armistead ? " I said to Carlos . " I guess he moved onto the boat . " " Where would that be ? " " In the marina . " He gestured toward the sea . After a few more spadefuls , he added : " Her name is Ariadne . " He pronounced the name slowly and carefully . " The girl ? " " The boat , " he said . " Mrs. Armistead told me it 's a Greek name . She 's crazy about Greece . " " She looks a little like a Greek . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said with a ruminative smile . The sound of the fire became louder , and his face changed . We spaded some more . I was beginning to feel the work in my shoulders and in the palms of my hands . My shirt was pasted to my back . " Is Mr. Armistead all by himself on the boat ? " " No . He 's got a boy with him . He calls him a crew , but I never seen him do any work on the boat . He 's one of these long-hairs , they call ' em . " Carlos raised his grimy hand to his head and caressed imaginary locks . " Does n't Mr. Armistead like girls ? " " Yeah , he likes girls . " He added thoughtfully : " There was a girl on the boat the other night . " " Blond girl ? " " Yeah . " " Did you see her ? " " My friend Pedro saw her when he was going out of the harbor yesterday morning . Pedro 's a fishermanhe gets up before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mast and yelling like she was going to jump . The boy was trying to talk her down . " " What did Pedro do ? " 65  | Carlos shrugged . " Pedro , he 's got children to feed . He do n't have time to stop and fool around with crazy girls . " Carlos went back to his work with renewed concentration , as if he was digging a foxhole that would shelter him against the contemporary world . I worked along behind him . But it was clear that we were wasting our time . The fire appeared at the top of the hill like a brilliant omniform growth which continued to grow until it bloomed very large against the sky . A sentinel quail on the hillside below it was ticking an alarm . Carlos looked up at the fire and crossed himself . Then he turned his back on it and beckoned to me and walked away from his furrow through the trees . One of the cypresses was beginning to smoke , high beyond the reach of Mrs. Armistead 's hose . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . " It would n't do no good . The trees are gon na go , and maybe the house , too . " The fire was coming down the hill , gathering speed and size . The trees had begun to sway . From the undergrowth beneath them , a bevy of stubby-winged quail flew up fighting for altitude over the house . Smoke like billowing darkness followed them . Mrs. Armistead went on spraying the trees with her ineffectual hose . Carlos moved past her to the faucet and turned it off . She stood with the dripping nozzle in her hand , facing the fire . It made a noise like a storm . Enormous and hot and wild , it leapt clumsily into the trees . The cypress that had been smoking burst into flames . Then the other trees blazed up like giant torches in a row . I took Mrs. Armistead by the hand and pulled her away . She resisted jerkily , instinctively , like a woman who had 66  | trouble taking direction . She held onto the hose as long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Carlos was waiting impatiently by the pool . Fire was falling around him , sputtering and turning black in the blue water . " We better get out of here , " he said . " We might could be cut off if she jumps the driveway . What do you want me to do about the fur coat ? " " Leave it in the pool , " she said . " It 's too hot for mink . " I did n't exactly like the woman , but I was beginning to take her personally . I gave Carlos the key to the Mercedes and went with her to the Lincoln Continental . " You can drive if you like , " she said . " I 'm a little done in . " She grimaced . The admission cost her pain . As we followed the Mercedes down the driveway , she added a kind of explanation : " I love those quail . I 've been feeding them and watching them ever since we built the house . They were finally beginning to feel safe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " The quail will come back . " " Maybe so . I wonder if I will . " We came to a turnaround which overlooked the city . Carlos pulled the Mercedes off the road , and I followed him . Smoke hung over the city , giving it a sepia tint like an old photograph . We climbed out of the cars and looked back at the house . The fire bent around it like the fingers of a hand , squeezing smoke out of the windows and then flame . We got back into our cars and turned downhill . It was my second evacuation of the day , and it made me feel slightly paranoid until I thought of the reason . The people I was getting involved with could afford to live in the open outside the city , right up against nature . 67  | There was only one good thing about the fire . It made people talk about the things that really concerned them . I asked Mrs. Armistead how long she had lived in the house . " Just four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and built it . It was part of an attempt to hold our marriage together , on the analogy of having a child . " " Do you have any children ? " " Only each other , " she answered in a wry voice . Then she added : " I wish I had a daughter . I wish even more that my husband had a daughter . " " On account of the blond girl ? " She turned toward me suddenly , with a kind of suppressed violence . " Just what do you know about the girl ? " " Very little . I 've only seen her once , at a distance . " " I 've never seen her at all , " the woman said . " She sounds like a kook . But it 's hard to tell about young people nowadays . " " It always was . " She was still watching my face . " You said that you 're a detective . Just what has the girl done ? " " I 'm trying to find out . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She must have done something wrong , besides taking the Mercedes . What did she do ? " " Ask Roger . " " I intend to . But you have n't explained why you 're so interested in her . " " She ran away with a six-year-old boy . It amounts to child stealing . " I held back the rest of the story . " Why would she do a thing like that ? " When I failed to answer that question , she asked another : " Is she on acid or some other drug ? " " She may be . " 68  | " I thought so . " She spoke with a kind of bitter satisfaction . " She went off the deep end the night before last , literally . She ended up jumping into the harbor . Jerry had to go in after her . " " Who 's Jerry ? " " The boy who lives on the boat . Roger calls him his crew , for want of a better word . " " What do you call him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I remembered the book in my pocket , with " Jerry Kilpatrick " inscribed on the flyleaf in pencil . " Do you know who he is ? " " He 's the son of Brian Kilpatrick , a real estate man in town . As a matter of fact Mr. Kilpatrick sold us that piece of property on the ridge . " " Is that how your husband met Jerry ? " " I think so . You could ask Roger . " " When will we be seeing Roger ? " " Quite soon , if he 's at the beach house . " We were passing through the center of the city . The main street was clogged with traffic , and the sidewalks were crowded . It was strange to see the people going about their business without apparent concern for the fire at the edges of the town . The people were moving more quickly than usual , perhaps , as if their lives had speeded up and might come to an end suddenly . Following Carlos in the Mercedes , I turned onto Maritime Drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of beach houses curving around a bay . Carlos led me into a parking lot behind the houses , and I drew up beside the Mercedes . " While I 'm thinking about it , " Mrs. Armistead said , " I 'll pay you now . How much ? " " A hundred will do it . " 69  | She produced a money clip made of gold in the shape of a dollar-sign and laid a hundred-dollar bill across my upper leg . Then she put a fifty on top of it . " That 's a tip , " she said . I took the money , since I needed it for expenses , but I felt vaguely declassed by the transaction , like a repossession man . It gave me a certain sympathy for Roger , even before I met him . The Armisteads ' beach house was a driftwood-gray building which we entered at the rear on the second-floor level . We moved past an open stairwell into the main room . It was furnished nautically , with brass , a wall barometer , captain 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could see a youngish man sitting on the balcony . He was sportily clad in a blue T-shirt and a boating cap , but he was watching the people on the beach from a distance , like a spectator sitting in a theatre box . " Hello , Roger . " The woman 's voice had changed . It was soft and musical , as if she was listening to it , tuning it carefully . The young man got up and took off his cap , showing neither surprise nor pleasure . " I did n't expect a visit from you , Fran . " " The house on Crescent Drive just burned to the ground . " His face lengthened . " With all my clothes ? " " You can always buy more clothes . " Her voice was partly serious and partly mocking , waiting for him to decide which way he wanted the meeting to go . He said a little belatedly : " Too bad about the house . You liked it , did n't you ? " " I liked it as long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to build again ? " " I do n't know , Roger . What do you think ? " 70  | He moved his heavy shoulders , shrugging off the threat of responsibility . " It 's really up to you , is n't it ? " " Well , I feel like traveling . " She spoke with a kind of fake decisiveness , like a woman improvising . " I may go to Yugoslavia . " He turned and stared at me , as if he 'd just discovered my presence . He was a good-looking man , perhaps ten years younger than his wife , with a strong impatient body . I noticed that his dark hair was thinning . He noticed that I noticed and ruffled it up with his hand . " This is Mr. Archer , " his wife said . " He 's a detective . He 's looking for the girl you had aboard the sloop . " " What girl ? " But he looked at me with instant dislike and flushed . " The one who tried to fly too near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I would n't know . I had nothing to do with her . " " Do you know her full name ? " I said . " Susan , I think . Sue Crandall . " His wife brightened up alarmingly . " I thought you said you had nothing to do with her . " " I did n't . I chewed Jerry out for having her aboard , and he told me what her name was . I had to force it out of him . " " The story came to me differently , " she said . " I heard she spent Thursday night on Ariadne with you . The marina 's rather a public place for that sort of thing , is n't it ? " He answered somberly : " I do n't mess with young chicks . I spent Thursday night here by myself , drinking . The girl was taken aboard without my knowledge and without my permission . " " Where 's she from ? " I said . " I do n't really know . Somewhere down south , according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long have you known her ? " 71  | He gave her a hard dull look . " Do n't be a broken record , Fran . I never met the Crandall girl . Ask Jerry Kilpatrick if you do n't believe me . The girl is his little friend . " " Who gave her the use of the Mercedes , if you did n't ? " " That was Jerry 's doing , too . I hate to blame it all on him , but that 's the truth . I chewed him out for it . " " I do n't believe you . You 're not going to have the Mercedes from now on . " " To hell with you then . " He moved past her to the open stairs and stamped down to the ground floor . There were sounds like drawers being opened and shut , and closet doors being slammed . The house was frame , with open rafters and without insulation , so that the angry sounds reverberated through it . Fran Armistead winced at them , as if the violence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her husband , I thought , and probably in love with him . She went down after him , looking strained and intent , like a woman descending voluntarily into hell . Their voices floated up the stairs , clearly audible in the intervals between the sounds of the surf . " Do n't be angry , " she said . " I 'm not angry . " " You can have the Mercedes . " " I need some transportation , " he said reasonably . " Not that I 'm going anywhere . " " No . You stay with me . I felt absolutely ghastly when the house burned . I felt as if my life was burning down . But it was n't , was it ? " " I do n't know . What 's this about going to Yugoslavia ? " " Do n't you want to go ? " " What 's in Yugoslavia ? " " We 'll stay here then . Does that suit you ? " 72  | " For the present , " he said . " I may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account of the girl ? What 's her nameSusan ? " " Listen . Do we have to go on about her ? I never even saw her . " A door closed , and their voices became muffled . I began to hear more private sounds , and decided to go outside . It was late on a Saturday afternoon , and the beach was littered with bodies . It was like a warning vision of the future , when every square foot of the world would be populated . I found a place to sit in the sand beside a youth with a guitar who lay propped against a girl 's stomach . I could smell her sun-tan oil , and I felt as if everybody but me was paired off like the animals in the ark . I got up and looked around me . Under the stratum of smoke which lay over the city , the air was harshly clear . The low sun was like a spinning yellow frisbee which I could almost reach out and catch . The thrusting masts of the marina looked dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took off my shoes and socks and carried them along the beach in that direction . A concrete breakwater extended by a sandbar curved like a sheltering arm around the harbor and marina . A few boats , under motor or sail , were coming in from the sea 73  | through the marked channel . A multitude of other boats lay in the slips , from racing yachts to superannuated landing craft . I walked along beside the high woven-wire fence which divided the marina from the public parking lot . There were several gates in it but they all had automatic locks . I found a boat rental dock near the foot of the breakwater and asked the man in charge how to get to Ariadne . He gave me a suspicious look which took in my bare feet and the shoes I had tied together and slung over my shoulder . " Mr. Armistead 's not aboard , if he 's the one you 're looking for . " " What about Jerry Kilpatrick ? " " I would n't know about him . Go down to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can see the boat from there , about halfway along the float on the left . " I put on my shoes and found the gate and the boat . She was a white sloop , poised on the quiet water in a way that made my breath come a little faster . A thin young man with straggling hair and a furred lower face was working over the auxiliary motor near her stern . I called to him through the locked gate . " Jerry ? " His head came up . I waved him toward me . He jumped down onto the slip and moved along it in a swift barefoot shamble . He was naked to the waist , and he walked with his bearded head thrust forward as though to cancel out his boy 's shoulders and his narrow hairless chest . His hands were so fouled with engine oil that he seemed to be wearing black gloves . He regarded me somberly through the wire gate . " What can I do for you ? " 74  | " You lost your book . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the flyleaf . " This is yours , is n't it ? " " Let me see . " He started to open the gate , then clicked it emphatically shut again . " If my father sent you , he can drop dead . And you can go back and tell him that I said that . " " I do n't know your father . " " Neither do I know him . I never knew him . And I do n't want to know him . " " That takes care of your father . What about me ? " " That 's your problem . " " Do n't you want your book ? " " Keep it , if you can read . It 'll improve your mind , if you have a mind . " He was a very hostile young man . I reminded myself that he was a witness , and there was no point in getting angry with him through a fence . " I can always get somebody to read it to me , " I said . He smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beard seemed extraordinarily bright . I said : " There 's a small boy missing . His father was killed this morning " You think I killed him ? " " Did you ? " " I do n't believe in violence . " His look implied that I did . " Then you 'll want to help me find whoever killed him . Why do n't you let me in ? Or come out and we can talk . " " I like it this way . " He fingered the wire gate . " You look like the violent type to me . " " The situation is n't funny , " I said . " The missing boy is six years old . His name is Ronald Broadhurst . Do you know anything about him ? " 75  | He shook his tangled head . The beard that covered his lower face seemed to have overgrown his mouth and left him only his eyes to speak with . They were brown , and slightly starred , like damaged glass . " A girl was with him , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of yours last night in bed . Her name is Sue Crandall . " " I do n't know her . " " I 've been told you do . She was here night before last . " " I would n't know about that . " " I think you would . You lent her this book , and you lent her Armistead 's Mercedes . What else did you lend her ? " " I do n't understand what you mean . " " She got stoned on something and climbed the mast . What did you give her , Jerry ? " A shadow of fear crossed his face . He converted it into anger . His brown eyes became reddish and hot , as if there was fire behind them . " I thought you were fuzz , " he said in a stylized way . " Why do n't you go away ? " " I want to talk to you seriously . You 're in trouble . " " Go to hell . " He trotted away along the slip . His hairy head seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a papiermache saint 's head on a stick . I stood and watched him vault into the cockpit of the boat and go back to work on the motor . The sun was almost down now . When it reached the water , the entire sea and sky seemed to ignite , burning red in a larger fire than Rattlesnake . Before it got dark I went through the parking lot looking for Fritz Snow 's old Chevrolet sedan . I could n't find it , but I had a persistent feeling that it had to be in the neighborhood . I began to search along the boulevard which paralleled the shore . 76  | The western sky lost its color like a face going suddenly pale . The light faded gradually from the air . It clung for a long time to the surface of the water , which stretched out like a faint and fallen sky . I walked for several blocks without finding the old Chevrolet . Street lights came on , and the waterfront was bleakly lit by the neon signs of motels and hamburger joints . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ double hamburger with a paper sack of French fried potatoes , and coffee . I ate and drank like a starved man , and remembered that I had n't eaten since morning . When I turned away from the bright counter , it was almost fully dark . I glanced up at the mountains , and was shocked by what I saw . The fire had grown and spread as if it fed on darkness . It hung around the city like the bivouacs of a besieging army . I took up my search for the Chevrolet again , working through the motel parking lots and up the side streets toward the railroad tracks . As soon as I left the boulevard , I was in a ghetto . Black and brown children were playing quiet games in the near-darkness . From the broken-down porches of the little houses , their mothers and grandmothers watched them and me . I found Fritz Snow 's half-painted Chevrolet in a rutted lane behind a dusty oleander hedge . There was music leaking out of it . A small man in a baseball cap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing , friend ? " " Playing my organ . " He put a mouth organ to his lips again and played a few bars of wheezy blue music . I 'm guilty , it seemed to say , but I 've suffered enoughso have you . " You play very well . " 77  | " It 's a gift . " He pointed skyward through the roof of the car . Then he blew a few more bars , and shook the spit out of his mouth organ . He smelled of wine . " Is this your car ? " I asked him . " I 'm watching it for a friend . " I got in beside him . The key was in the ignition , and I took it . He gave me a glinting apprehensive look . " My name is Archer . What 's your name ? " " Amos Johnstone . You got no right or reason to bust me . I 'm really and truly watching it for a friend . " " I 'm not a cop . Is your friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's her . She gave me a dollartold me to sit in the car till she came back . " " How long ago was that ? " " I du n no , I do n't carry a watch . Only thing I can swear to , it was today . " " Before dark ? " He peered at the sky as if nightfall had taken him by surprise . " Must have been . I bought some wine with the dollar , and it 's gone . " He glanced around at me . " I could use another dollar . " " Maybe we 'll get to that . Where did the young lady go ? " " Down the street . " He gestured in the direction of the marina . " And she took the boy with her ? " " Yessir . " " Was he all right ? " " He was scared . " " Did he say anything ? " " He did n't say a word to me . But he was shivering like a puppy . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marina . 78  | He played me some farewell music which merged with the voices of the children playing in the dark . There were a few scattered lights on the boats along the slips . A steadier , more brilliant light shone over the wire gate from the top of a metal pole . I took a quick look around and went over the gate , snagging one leg on the barbed wire across the top of it and coming down hard on my back on the slanting gangway . It shook me , and I stayed down for a minute . My blood was beating in my ears and eyes as I approached the sloop . There was a light in the cabin , but no one on deck that I could see . In spite of the circumstances , there was something secret and sweet about the dark water , and something beautiful about the boat , like a corralled horse at night . I climbed over the railing into the cockpit . The mast towered up against the obscure sky . There was a scuffling noise in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Jerry 's voice . He opened the hatchway and stuck out his head . His eyes were wide and glaring , and his open mouth was like a dark hole in his beard . He looked like Lazarus coming out of the tomb . I reached for him , got hold of his body under the arms , lifted him up , and set him down hard in the cockpit on his back . He stayed down , as if he had hit his head . I felt a twinge of shame at hurting a boy . I went down the ladder into the cabin , past a ship-to-shore radio and a chart table . On one of the two lower bunks a girl-shaped body was lying under a red blanket with only its blond hair showing , spilling like twisted gold across the pillow . I pulled the blanket off her face . Her expression was queerly impassive . Her eyes looked at me from some other place , almost as if she was ready to die or perhaps already had . 79  | Something besides her body was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was holding the small boy against her , with one arm curled around his head and her hand over his mouth . He lay still beside her . Even his round blue eyes were perfectly still . They flickered past me . I turned in the cramped space . Jerry was crouched on the ladder with a revolver held in both his hands . " Get off this boat , you grungy pig . " " Put the gun away . You 'll hurt somebody . " " You , " he said . " Unless you get off here now . I 'm in charge of this boat , and you 're trespassing . " It was hard to take him seriously , but the gun helped . He waved it at me , and moved to one side . I climbed out past him , undecided whether I should try to take him or pass . My indecision made me slow . Out of the corner of my eye I saw him shift the gun in his hands and swing it up by the barrel . I failed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was watching the cogwheels of the universe turning . It resembled , on a large scale , one of those boxes of gears that engineers fool around with in their spare time . I seemed to be able to see the whole apparatus at once , and to understand that the ratio of output to input was one to one . 8o  | Quiet water lapped at the edge of my attention . The side of my face was against a flat rough surface which seemed to rise and fall . The air seemed cooler , and I thought for a while that I was on the boat . Then I got up onto my hands and knees and saw that I was on the slip and that the space where Ariadne had lain was an oblong of dark water . I dipped up some of the water in my hand and splashed it on my face . I was dizzy and depressed . I had n't taken the bearded boy seriously enough , and mishandled both him and the situation . I checked my wallet : the money was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gangway to a public rest station in the parking lot . I washed my face again , without looking too closely at it , and decided not to mess with the swelling on my head , which had stopped bleeding . I found a pay phone , with a directory chained to it , on the outside wall of the building and called the sheriff 's office . The deputy on duty told me that the sheriff and most of his officers were in the fire zone . He was swamped with calls and had no one to send out . I dialed the local Forest Service number . The female voice of an answering service informed me that no calls were taken after business hours , but she agreed to accept a message for Kelsey . I dictated a telegraphic version of recent events and listened to the operator read it back to me in a bored voice . Next I looked up Brian Kilpatrick in the Real Estate section of the yellow pages . Both home and business numbers were listed for him . I called Kilpatrick 's home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could come and see him . He sighed . " I just sat down with a drink . What 's on your mind ? " " Your son Jerry . " " I see . Are you an officer ? " His carefully modulated voice had flattened out . 8i  | " A private detective . " " Does this have to do with the trouble at the harbor yesterday morning ? " " I 'm afraid it does , and it 's getting worse . May I come and talk to you ? " " You still have n't said what about . Is a girl involved in this ? " " Yes . She 's a young blond named Susan Crandall . Susan and your son and a little boy named Ron Broadhurst have taken off " " Is that Mrs. Broadhurst 's grandson ? " " Yes , it is . " " Where in the name of heaven have they gone ? " " To sea . They took the Armistead yacht . " " Does Roger Armistead know about this ? " " Not yet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " You 'd better come over as you suggest . Do you know where I live ? " He gave me the address , twice . I called a cab and repeated the address to the driver . He was one of the loquacious ones . He talked about fires and floods , earthquakes and oil spills . Why , he wanted to know , would anyone want to live in California ? If things got any worse , he was going to move his family back to Motown . That was a city . He took me to an upper-middle residential area on the side of the city which was not yet threatened by the fire . Kilpatrick 's modern ranch house lay on a floodlit pad on the side of a brush-covered slope . I had left the cool air lower in the city , and hot wind blew in my face when I got out of the cab . I told the driver to wait . Kilpatrick came out to meet me . He was a big man wearing an open-necked sport shirt over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both his head and his chest . In spite of the drink in his hand , and the dead-fish gleam of previous drinks in his eyes , his large handsome face was sober , almost lugubrious . He offered me his hand , and peered at my injured head . " What happened to you ? " " Your son Jerry happened to me . He hit me with a gunbutt . " Kilpatrick made a commiserating face . " I want to say right now I 'm heartily sorry . But , " he added , " I 'm not responsible for what Jerry does . He 's gotten beyond my control . " " So I gather . Can we go inside ? " " By all means . You 'll be wanting a drink . " He ushered me into a bar and game room which overlooked a brilliantly lighted pool . Beside the pool a woman with black hair and gleaming copper-colored legs was sitting in a long chair which concealed the rest of her . A portable radio on a table beside her was talking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood by the radio . Kilpatrick closed the venetian blinds before he turned up the light . He said that he was drinking martinis , and I asked for scotch and water , which he poured . We sat facing each other across a round table which had a chessboard made of light and dark squares of wood inlaid in its center . He said in a cautious measured voice : " I suppose I better tell you that I heard from the girl 's father earlier today . He found my son 's name in his daughter 's address book . " " How long has the girl been missing from home ? Did Crandall say ? " Kilpatrick nodded . " A couple of days . She walked out on her parents Thursday . " " Did Crandall say why ? " " He does n't know why , any more than I do . " He added 83  | in a discouraged voice which made him sound like an old man : " We 're losing a whole generation . They 're punishing us for bringing them into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town here ? " " No . " " How do your son and their daughter happen to know each other ? " " I have no idea . All I know is what Crandall told me . " " What 's Crandall 's full name and where does he live ? " Kilpatrick lifted his palm in a traffic-halting gesture . " Before I tell you anything more , you 'd better fill me in on the ramifications . How does the Broadhurst boy come into this ? What are they planning to do with him ? " " There may not be any plan at all . It looks as if they 're playing it by ear . But on the other hand it may be a kidnaping . It is now , in the legal sense . " " For money ? Jerry claims that he despises money . " " Money is n't the only motive for kidnaping . " " What else is there ? " Kilpatrick said . " Revenge . Power . Kicks . " " That does n't sound like Jerry . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's a fairly nice girl from a fairly nice family . Maybe not a happy girl , her father said , but a girl you can depend on . " " That 's what Lizzie Borden 's father used to say about her . " Kilpatrick gave me a shocked look . " It 's a pretty farfetched comparison , is n't it ? " " I hope so . The man she was traveling with todaythe little boy 's fatherwas killed with a pickax . " Kilpatrick 's face grew pale , setting its broken veins in relief . He finished his martini , and sucked audibly at the dry glass . " Are you telling me Stanley Broadhurst has been killed ? " 84  | " Yes . " " You think she murdered him ? " " I do n't know . But if she did , the Broadhurst boy is probably a witness . " " Was Jerry there ? " " I do n't know . " " Where did this murder take place ? " " At the head of Mrs. Broadhurst 's canyon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire was started at the same time . " Kilpatrick began to drum on the table with his glass . He got up and went to the bar , searching along the shelves of bottles behind it for something guaranteed to relieve anxiety . He came back to the table empty-handed , and soberer than ever . " You should have told me about this when you called me in the first place . I never would have " His voice broke off , and he glared at me distrustfully . " You never would have let me in or talked to me , " I said . " Where does Crandall live ? " " I 'm not saying . " " You might as well . None of this will be a secret for long . The only positive thing we can do is try and head off Jerry and the girl before they make more trouble . " " What ' more could they do ? " " Lose the boy , " I said . " Or kill him . " He looked at me narrow-eyed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Mrs. Stanley Broadhurst hired me to get him back . " " So you 're on the other side . " " The boy 's side . " " Do you know him ? " " Slightly . " " And you care about him personally ? " 85  | " Yes , I do . " " Then you have some faint idea of how I feel about my son . " " I 'd have a better idea if you 'd cooperate fully . I 'm trying to head off trouble for you and your son . " " You smell like trouble to me , " he said . That stopped me for a minute . He had a salesman 's insight into human weakness , and he 'd touched on a fact which I did n't always admit to myselfthat I sometimes served as a catalyst for trouble , not unwillingly . With some idea of changing the subject a little , I brought out the green-covered book with his son 's name penciled on the flyleaf . " How did Sue Crandall get hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " I suppose Jerry took it when he left . I do n't pay too much attention to the books . My wife was the intellectual in the family . She graduated from Stanford . " " Is Mrs. Kilpatrick at home ? " He shook his head . " Ellen left me years ago . The girl out by the pool is my fiancee . " " How long ago did Jerry leave ? " " A couple of months . He moved onto the yacht in June . But actually he left me a year ago , as far as any real relationship is concerned . That was when he went away to college . " " He 's in college ? " " Not any more , " Kilpatrick said in a disappointed voice . " He could have handled it easily . I was all set to send him right through to a master 's in business administration . But he refused to make the effort . Do n't ask me why , because I do n't know the answer . " He reached across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's name . 86  | " Is Jerry on drugs ? " " I would n't know about that . " But his eyes were dubious and avoided mine . The conversation was running down , and it was n't hard to guess why . He was afraid of involving his son in murder . " You knew about the incident on the yacht , " I said . " When the girl jumped overboard . " " That 's right . I got the word from the harbor people . But I did n't know that drugs were involved . " Kilpatrick leaned toward me abruptly and took hold of my untouched scotch and water . " If you 're not going to use that , I am , " he said , and drank it down . We sat in opposing silences . He was studying the inlaid board as if there were chessmen on it , most of them mine . Finally he looked up and met my eyes . " You think she got drugs from Jerry , do n't you ? " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more , " he said . " But I suspected he was using drugs . It was one of the bones of contention between us . " " What kind of drugs ? " " I do n't really know . But he talked and acted as if he had blown his mind . " The phrase was strange on his lips , and somehow touching , like a statement of fellow-feeling with his lost son . He added nervously : " I 've told you more than I should have . " " You might as well tell me the rest of it . " " There is no rest of it . That 's all there is . I had a bright promising boy and one day he decided to change all that and go and live like a waterfront bum . " " What 's his in with Roger Armistead ? " " I sold some property to Armistead , and Armistead 's always liked him . He taught him to sail . Last year Jerry crewed for him in the Ensenada race . " 87  | " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is . He could sail that sloop to Hawaii if he had to . " His mood swung down : " Unless he 's forgotten his navigation along with everything else . " He rose and went to the blinded window , separating the slats with his fingers and peering out , like a man in a building under attack . " Dammit , " he said . " I was supposed to take my fiancee to dinner . " He turned on me in quick anger . " I suppose you realize you 're wrecking my evening ? " The question did n't deserve an answer , and he knew it . He drifted to the bar as if he might find a ghostly bartender to complain to . There was a telephone on the bar , with a little blue book beside it . He opened the book as if to look up a number , then dropped it again . Instead he got out a fresh glass and poured a scotch and water and rapped it down in front of me . I thanked him for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could feel a long night coming on . So could Kilpatrick . He stood above me leaning on the table , his hands splayed out , his face expanding with emotion . " Look , " he said . " I 'm not the swinging bastard Iyou think I am . When Jerry was just a tot my wife ran out on me . I never gave her any good reason to leave me , except that I could n't provide the life romantic . But Jerry blamed me for the breakup . He 's always blamed me for everything . " He drew in a deep mournful breath . " I really do care about him . I wanted the best for him , and knocked myself out to provide it . But things do n't work out like that any more , do they ? No more happy endings . " He leaned above me , listening to the silence as if he was hearing it for the first time . I said : " What can we do to get him and Susan back ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of calling the FBI . " " Do n't do that . It would be the end of Jerry . " I felt his heavy hand on my shoulder . He removed it and went to the bar again , moving like a caged animal that had paced out the short distance many times . He poured himself a scotch and resumed his place at the round table . " Give him a chance to bring the sloop back on his own . We do n't have to make a federal case out of it . " " We 're going to have to tell the local police . " " Let me do that , " he said . " I 'll talk to Sheriff Tremainehe 's a friend of mine . " " Tonight ? " " Of course tonight . I 'm more concerned than you are . Jerry 's my son . What happens to him happens to mc . " He sounded as if he wanted to mean it , but could n't quite feel the full sense of the words . " Then tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I particularly want to talk to her father . " " I 'm sorry . I would n't feel right about it . " I hit him with the hardest words I could think of : " You may never feel right about anything again . The situation is going to hell in a handcar , and you wo n't lift a finger to stop it . Still you expect some kind of happy ending . " " I do n't expect one . I said that . " He wiped his eyes and cheeks with a downward motion of his palms , which stayed pressed together at his chin in a prayerful attitude . " You 've got to give me time to think this through . " " Sure . Take several hours . I 'll sit here and wonder what 's happening to the Broadhurst boy . " Kilpatrick gave me a grave look across his peaked fingers . I caught a glimpse of the broken seriousness which lived in him like a spoiled priest in hiding . The doorbell chimed , and he left the room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small blue book beside the 89  | phone . It contained a handwritten list of numbers . A Lester Crandall was listed among the C 's , with a Pacific Palisades number . The listing probably was n't newthere were other names below it on the page . As I was making a note of it , the door was flung open behind me . It was the dark-haired woman from the poolside . She was a handsome woman , but a little old for the bikini she was wearing . And she was smashed . " Where 's the action ? " she said boisterously . " There is none . " The corners of her mouth drooped like a disappointed child 's . " Brian promised to take me dancing . " She did a few experimental steps , and almost fell down . I led her to one of the chairs , but she did n't want to sit still . She wanted to dance . Kilpatrick came into the room . He gave no sign of noticing the woman . Moving like something mechanical and preaimed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took out a heavy revolver . " What goes on ? " I asked him . He gave no answer , but I did n't like the look of inert cold anger on his face . I followed him out to the front of the house , letting him know I was there . A rather wild-eyed young man with soot on his forehead was waiting at the front door . Kilpatrick showed him the gun . " Get out of here . I do n't have to put up with this kind of nonsense . " " You call it nonsense , do you ? " the young man said . " I lost my house and my furniture . My family 's clothes . Everything . And I 'm holding you responsible , Mr. Kilpatrick . " " How am I responsible ? " " I talked to a fireman after my house burned downtoo bad he was n't there when it burned , but he wasn'tand he said that canyon should never have been built in , with the 90  | high fire hazard . You never even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's a risk we all run , " Kilpatrick said . " I could be burned out tonight or tomorrow myself . " " I hope you are . I hope your house burns down . " " Is that what you came here to tell me ? " " Not exactly . " The young man sounded a little ashamed . " But I 've got no place to spend the night . " " You 're not going to spend it here . " " No . I realize that . " He ran out of words . With a parting look at the gun in Kilpatrick 's hand , he walked quickly to a station wagon which was parked beside my taxicab . A number of children peered out through the back windows of the wagon , like prisoners wondering where they might be taken next . A woman sat in the front seat , looking straight ahead . I said to Kilpatrick : " I 'm glad you did n't shoot him . " " I had no intention of shooting him . But you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't have to take " I cut in : " What area did he live in ? " " Canyon Estates . I 'm the developer . " " Did the canyon go ? " " Not all of it . But several houses burned , including his . " Kilpatrick jerked his angry head toward the departing station wagon . " He is n't the only one who took a beating . I 'm still paying interest on some of those houses , and I 'll never be able to move them now . " " Do you know what happened to Elizabeth Broadhurst 's house ? " " The last I heard it was still standing . Those old Spanishtype structures were built to resist fire . " The dark-haired woman came up behind Kilpatrick . She had put on a light coat over her bikini and she looked quite sober , but sick . 91  | " For heaven 's sake , " she said to him , " put that gun away . It scares the living hell out of me when you wave that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around . " But he shoved it down out of sight in his pocket . The three of us stepped out onto the asphalt pad . The cabdriver was watching us like an observer from Mars . Kilpatrick wet his finger in his mouth and held it up . A cool wind was blowing up the canyon . " That 's sea air , " he said . " If it keeps blowing from that direction we 're going to be A-O.K . " I hoped he was right . But the eastern edges of the sky were still burning like curtains . It cost me fifty dollars , paid in advance , to be driven to Northridge , where I 'd left my car in Stanley Broadhurst 's garage . The driver wanted to talk , but I shut him off and caught an hour 's sleep . I woke up with a pounding head when we left the Ventura Freeway . I told the driver to stop at a public pay phone . He found one and gave me change for a dollar . I dialed Lester Crandall 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was being kept under strict control said : " This is the Crandall residence . " 92  | " Is Mr. Crandall home ? " " I 'm afraid he is n't . I do n't know when he 'll be back . " " Where is he ? " " On the Strip . " " Looking for Susan ? " Her voice became more personal . " Yes , he is . Are you a friend of Lester 's ? " " No . But I 've seen your daughter . She is n't in Los Angeles . May I come and talk to you , Mrs. Crandall ? " " I do n't know . Are you a policeman ? " I told her what I was , and gave her my name , and she responded with her address . It was on a street I knew off Sunset Boulevard . The cab took me under the freeway to Northridge . I 'd kept the key to the Broadhurst garage . I asked the driver to wait while I used the key and made sure my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started . I went out to the street and dismissed the driver . When I went to the back of the house a second time , I looked around more carefully . Some light came from the neighbor 's on the other side of the grape-stake fence . I noticed that the back door of Stanley Broadhurst 's house was slightly ajar . I opened it all the way and turned on the kitchen lights . There were marks in the wood around the lock which showed that it had been jimmied . It occurred to me that the man who had done the job might still be inside . I did n't want to run into him accidentally . Burglars seldom intended to kill anyone , but they sometimes killed when they were caught by surprise in their dark fantasy . I turned off the kitchen lights and waited . The house was silent . From outside I could hear the pulsing hum of the arterial boulevard I had just left . 93  | The neighbors were listening to the late news on television . In spite of these normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It got worse when I went into the hallway . Perhaps I smelled or otherwise sensed the man in the study . In any case , when I switched on the light he was lying there in front of the broken desk , grinning up at me like a magician who had pulled off the ultimate trick . I did n't recognize him right away . He had a black beard and mustache and long black hair which seemed to grow peculiarly low on his forehead . I found on closer inspection that the hair was a wig which did n't fit him too well . The beard and mustache were false . Under the hair was the dead face of the man who called himself Al and had come to the house to ask for a thousand dollars . Come once too often . The front of his shirt was wet and heavy with blood , and there were stab wounds under it . He smelled of whisky . The inside breast pocket of his cheap dark suit bore the label of a San Francisco department store . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pockets . I lifted him to feel for a wallet in his hip pockets . There was none . I checked my notebook for the address he had given me : the Star Motel , on Pacific Coast Highway below Topanga Canyon . Then I looked at the rolltop desk which he had evidently broken open . The wood around the locking mechanism was splintered , and the rolltop section was stuck in a half-open position . I could n't force it far enough back to release the drawers , which stayed locked . But in one of the pigeonholes I found a pair of photographs of a young man and a young woman who at first glance looked alike . Clipped to the photographs was a piece of paper with the printed heading : " Memo from the desk of Stanley Broadhurst . " 94  | Someone , presumably Stanley , had written laboriously on it : " Have you seen this man and woman ? According to witnesses they left Santa Teresa early in July , 1955 , and traveled to San Francisco by car ( red Porsche , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francisco one or two nights , and sailed July 6 en route to Honolulu via Vancouver on the English freighter Swansea Castle . A thousand-dollar reward will be paid for information about their present whereabouts . " I took another look at the pictures attached to it . The girl had dark hair and very large dark eyes which looked up rather dimly out of the old photograph . Her features seemed to be aquiline and sensitive , except for her heavy passionate mouth . The man 's face , which I took to be Captain Broadhurst 's , was less open . There were well-shaped bones in his face and hard , staring eyes set obliquely in them . The resemblance between him and the girl turned out to be superficial when I compared them . His bold stare kept him hidden in a way , but I guessed that he was a taker . She looked like a giver . I turned to the filing cabinet . Its top drawer had been forced , so violently that it could n't be properly closed . It was full of letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past six years . I picked out a fairly recent one whose return address was the Santa Teresa Travel Agency , 920 Main Street . Dear Mr. Broadhurst the typed letter said : Have checked our files as per your request and confirm that your father , Mr. Leo Broadhurst , booked double passage on the Swansea Castle , due to sail from San Francisco for Honolulu ( via Vancouver ) on or about July 6 , 1955 . Passage paid for , but we can not confirm that it was used . Swansea Castle 95  | has changed to Liberian registry , and 1955 owners and master are hard to trace . Please advise if you wish us to check further . Faithfully yours , Harvey Noble , Proprietor I looked at an older letter which was handwritten on the stationery of a Santa Teresa church and signed by the pastor , a Reverend Lowell Riceyman . Dear Stanley it said , Your father Leo Broadhurst was one of my parishioners , in the sense that he sometimes attended Sunday services , as you may recall , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . I 'm sure the fault must have been mine as much as his . He gave the impression of being a sportsman , an active and spirited man who enjoyed life . No doubt that is your recollection a him , too . May I suggest in all good feeling and sympathy that you be content with that recollection , and not pursue any further the course you have embarked on , against my advice . Your father chose to leave your mother and you , for reasons which neither you nor I can fathom . The heart has its reasons that the reason does not know . I think it is unwise for a son to attempt to delve too deeply into his father 's life . What man is without blame ? Think of your own life , Stanley . You have recently taken on the responsibilities of marriageas I , having had the pleasure of performing the ceremony , have good cause to remember . Your wife is a fine and lovely girl , clearly more worthy of your living interest than those old passions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do very little for usno more than it has already done , for good or illexcept in the end to release us . We must seek and accept release , and give release . Concerning the marital problems of which you write me , believe me , they are not unusual . But I would prefer to discuss 96  | them with you personally , rather than commit my poor thoughts to paper . Until I see you , then . I looked down at the dead man , and thought of the other dead man on the mountain . The Reverend Riceyman had given Stanley good advice , which he had failed to take . A feeling of embarrassment and regret went through me . It was n't exactly grief for Stanley , though it included that . It also included the realization that I had to call the police . I left the , phone in the study untouched and went back to the kitchen . As soon as I switched on the lights , I noticed the empty brown whisky bottle standing among the dishes in the sink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported a homicide . During the nine or ten minutes that the police took to answer the call , I walked halfway along the block and found Al 's Volkswagen , locked . At the very last minute , when I could already hear the siren , I remembered that the engine of my car was running . I went out to the garage and turned it off . I had a light hat in the trunk . I used it to cover my damaged head , and met the patrol car out in front of the house . The man next door came out and looked at us and went back into his house without saying anything . I took the officers in through the back door , pointing out the jimmy marks . I showed them the dead man and told them briefly how I had happened to find him . They made a few notes and put in a call for a homicide team , suggesting politely that I stick around . I told my story in greater detail to a captain of detectives named Arnie Shipstad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Hollywood division . Arnie was 97  | a fresh-faced Swede with shrewd sensitive eyes which registered the details of the study as precisely as the cameras of his photographer did . The dead man had his picture taken with and without his wig and beard and mustache . Then he was carefully rolled onto a stretcher and carried out . Arnie lingered . " So you think he came here for money ? " " I 'm sure he did . " " But he got something different . And the man who prom-. ised him money is dead , too . " He picked up Stanley 's memo , which I had shown him , and read aloud : " Have you seen this man and woman ? ' Is this what it 's all about ? " " It could be . " " Why do you think he came here in disguise ? " " I can think of a couple of possible reasons . He may be wanted . I 'd lay even money that he is wanted . " Arnie nodded in agreement . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibility , too . " " What 's that ? " " He may have been wearing the outfit for fun and games . Quite a few swingers use longhair wigs when they go quailhunting . This one may have been planning to pick up his money and have a night on the town . " I had to admit there was something in the idea . I 98  | I left Sepulveda at Sunset and drove into Pacific Palisades . The Crandalls lived on a palm-lined street in a kind of Tudor manor with a peaked roof and brown protruding half-timbers . The mullioned windows were all lighted as though a Saturday night party was going on . But the only sound I heard before I knocked was the sighing and scratching of the wind through the dry palm fronds . A blond woman in black opened the ornately carved door . Her body was so trim against the light that I thought for a moment she was the girl . Then she inclined her head to look at me , and I saw that time had faintly touched her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrowed her eyes and peered past me into the darkness . " Are you Mr. Archer ? " " Yes . May I come in ? " " Please do . My husband is home now , but he 's resting . " Her speech was carefully correct , as if she had taken lessons in talking . I suspected that her natural speech was a good deal rougher and freer . She led me into a formal sitting room with a blazing crystal chandelier which hurt my eyes and an unlit marble fireplace . We sat down in facing conversation chairs . Her body 99  | fell into a beautiful still pose , but her faintly pinched blond face seemed bored with it , or resentful , like an angel living with an animal . " Was Susan all right when you saw her ? " " She was n't hurt , if that 's what you mean . " " Where is she now ? " " I do n't know . " " You mentioned serious trouble . " Her voice was soft and small , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell me what you mean , and please be frank . This is the third night now that I 've been sitting by the telephone . " " I know how it is . " She inclined toward me . Her breasts leaned out from her body . " Do you have children ? " " No , but my clients do . Susan has one of those children with her nowa small boy named Ronald Broadhurst . Have you ever heard of him ? " She hesitated for a moment , in deep thought , then shook her head . " I 'm afraid I have n't . " " Ronald 's father was murdered this morning . Stanley Broadhurst . " She failed to react to the name . While she listened raptly like a child at a fairy tale , I gave her an account of the day . Her hands climbed from her lap like small independent creatures with red feet , and fastened on her breasts . She said : " Susan could n't have done what was done to Mr. Broadhurst . She 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't hurt the little boy . " " Why would she grab him ? " The word jolted the woman . She looked at me with some dislike , as if I 'd threatened the dream she was living in . Her hands fell away from her breasts . ioo  | " There must be some explanation . " " Do you know why she left home ? " " ILester and I have n't been able to understand it . Everything was going along smoothly . She 'd been accepted at UCLA and she was on a good summer programtennis and diving lessons and conversational French . Then on Thursday morning , when we were out shopping , she left without any warning . She did n't even say goodbye to us . " " Did you report it to the police ? " " Lester did . They told him they could n't promise much there are dozens of missing young people every week . But I never thought my daughter would be one of them . Susan has had a really good life . We 've given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hard truth : " Have there been any radical changes in Susan lately ? " " What do you mean ? " " Any big change in her habits . Like sleeping a lot more or a lot less . Getting excited and staying that way , or turning apathetic and letting her appearance go to pot . " " None of those things . She is n't on drugs , if that 's what you have in mind . " " Think about it , though . Thursday night in Santa Teresa she had what sounds like a bad trip and jumped into the ocean . " " Was Jerry Kilpatrick with her ? " " Yes . Do you know him , Mrs. Crandall ? " " He 's been here at the house . We met him at Newport . I ' He seemed like a nice enough boy to me . " " When was he here ? " " A couple of months ago . He and my husband got into an argument , and he never came back after that . " She sounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zoi  | " You 'll have to ask Lester . They just did n't take to each other . " " May I speak to your husband ? " " He 's lying down . He 's had a rough couple of days . " " I 'm sorry , but maybe you 'd better get him up . " " I do n't believe I should . Lester is no longer young , you know . " She did n't move . She was one of those dreaming blonds who could n't bear to face a change in her life . One of those waiting mothers who would sit forever beside the phone but did n't know what to say when it finally rang . " Your daughter 's at sea with a teen-age dropout , under suspicion of child-stealing and murder . And you do n't want to disturb her father . " I got up and opened the door of the sitting room : " If you wo n't call your husband , I think I 'd better . " " I will , if you insist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel the small chill presence that lived like a stunted child in her fine body . The same cold presence reflected itself in the room . The chandelier for all its blaze was like a cluster of frozen tears . The white marble mantel was tomblike . The flowers in the vases were plastic , unsmellable , giving off a dull sense of artificial life . Lester Crandall came into the room as if he was the visitor , not I. He was a short heavy-bodied man with iron gray hair and sideburns which seemed to pincer his slightly crumpled face and hold it out for inspection . His smile was that of a man who wanted to be liked . His handshake was firm , and I noticed that his hands were large and rather misshapen . They bore the old marks of heavy work : swollen knuckles , roughened skin . He had spent his life , I thought , working his way to the top of a L 102  | small hill which his daughter had abandoned in one jump . He was wearing a figured red-silk bathrobe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his hair damp from the shower . I told him I was sorry to disturb him . He waved the thought away . " I 'd be glad to get up at any hour of the night , believe me . I understand you have word of my little girl ? " I told him briefly what I knew . Under the pressure of my words his face seemed to be forced back on its bones . But he refused to admit the fear that was making his eyes water . " There must be a reason for what she 's doing . Susan 's a sensible girl . I do n't believe she 's been taking drugs . " " What you believe wo n't change the facts , " I said . " But you do n't know her . I spent most of the evening traipsing up and down the Sunset Strip . It gave me a real insight into what 's happening to the youth of today . But Susan is n't like that at all . She 's very organized at all times . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if the little speech on top of the long evening had exhausted him . I sat in the other . " We wo n't argue , " I said . " One good lead is worth all the theories in the world . " " You 're very right . " " May I see Susan 's address book ? I understand you have it . " He looked up at his wife , who was hovering near him . " Would you get it for me , Mother ? It 's on the desk in the library . " After she left the room , I said to Crandall : " When something like this happens in a family , there 's nearly always some advance warning . Has Susan been in any kind of trouble lately ? " " None at all . Never in her life , if you want the truth . " 103  | " Any drinking ? " " She does n't even like it . I give her a taste of my drink now and then , but she always makes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imprinted in his flesh as an expression of dismay . I wondered what he was remembering or trying to forget . " What does she do for fun ? " " We 're a very close family , " he said . " The three of us spend a lot of time together . I own some motels up and down the coast , and the three of us go on a lot of little trips combining business and pleasure . And of course Susan has her activity programtennis and diving lessons and French conversation . " He was like a man with his eyes closed trying to put his hands on a girl that was n't there . I began to think I had a glimmering of the problem . It was often the same probleman unreality so bland and smothering that the children tore loose and impaled themselves on the spikes of any reality that offered . Or made their own unreality with drugs . " Does she spend much time on the Strip ? " " No sir , she never goes therenot to my knowledge . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to me . He said it 's a port of missing girls and he thought I might see her there . " " What kind of boys does she run with ? " " She does n't have too much to do with boys . She 's gone to some supervised parties , of course , and we 've sent her to dancing school for yearsballroom as well as ballet . But as for boys , frankly I 've discouraged it , the state of the modern world being what it is . Most of her friends and acquaintances are girls . " " What about Jerry Kilpatrick ? I understand he visited your daughter . " 104  | Crandall flushed . " Yes . He came here back in June . He and Sue seemed to have a lot to talk about , but they shut up when I came into the room . I did n't like that . " " Did n't you have an argument with him ? " He gave me a quick narrow look . " Who told you that ? " " Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " Yes , we had an argument . I tried to straighten the boy out on his philosophy of life . I asked him in a friendly way what he planned to do with himself , and he said all he wanted was just to get by . I did n't think that was a satisfactory answer , and I asked him what would happen to the country if everybody took that attitude . He said it had already happened to the country . I do n't know what he meant by that , but I did n't like his tone . I told him if that was his philosophy of life he could leave my home and not bother coming back . The little twerp said he 'd be glad to . And he left and never did come back . Which was good riddance of bad rubbish . " Crandall 's face was dusky red . A pulse at the side of his forehead throbbed . My sore head throbbed in sympathy . " Mrs. Crandall thought at the time I 'd made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women are . If a girl is n't married or at least engaged by age eighteen , they think she 's bound to be an old maid . " Crandall lifted his head as if he 'd picked up a signal that was inaudible to me . " I wonder what Mother 's doing in the library . " He got up and opened the door of the room , and I followed him down the hall . His body moved heavily and dolefully , as if it was weighted down by a kind of despair which had n't yet reached his consciousness . The sound of a woman crying came through the library door . Mrs. Crandall was standing up and sobbing against a wall of empty shelves . Crandall went to her and tried to quiet her shaking back with his hands . 105  | " Do n't cry , Mother . We 'll get her back . " " No . " She shook her head . " Susan will never come back here . We had no right to bring her here in the first place . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't belong in this place . Everybody knows it except you . " " That 's not true , Mother . I 've got a higher net worth than anybody on this block . I could buy and sell most of them . " " What good is net worth ? We 're like fish out of water . I 've got no friends on this streetand neither has Susan . " His large hands grasped her shoulders and forced her to turn and face him . " That 's just your imagination , Mother . I always get a friendly smile and nod when I drive past . They know who I am . They know I 've got what it takes . " " Maybe you have . It does n't help Susanor me . " " Help you do what ? " " Just live , " she said . " I 've been trying to pretend that everything is okay . But now we know it is n't . " " It will be . I guarantee it . Everything will be , hunky-dory again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonsense , and you know it . " She shook her head . He reached up and stopped her movement of denial with his hands , as if it was merely a physical accident . He pushed the hair back from her forehead , which looked clear and untroubled in contrast with her tearstreaked face . She leaned on him , letting him hold her up . Her face on his shoulder was inert , and unaware of me , like that of a woman who had drowned in her own life . Walking in a kind of lockstep , they went out into the hallway and left me alone in the room . I noticed a small red-1o6  | leather book lying open on a corner table , and I sat down to look at it . The word " Addresses " was stamped in gold on the cover , and inside on the flyleaf the girl had written her name in an unformed hand : " Susan Crandall . " There were three other girls ' names in the book , and one boy 's name , Jerry Kilpatrick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about . The family had been a lonely trio , living like actors on a Hollywood set , and now there were only two of them to sustain the dream . Mrs. Crandall came into the room and startled me out of my thoughts . She had combed her hair and washed her face and made it up quickly and expertly . " I 'm sorry , Mr. Archer , I did n't mean to break down . " " Nobody ever does . But sometimes it 's a good idea . " " Not for me . And not for Lester . You would n't think it to look at him , but he 's an emotional man , and he loves Susan . " She came over to the table . Her grief still clung to her body like a perfume . She was one of those women whose feminine quality persisted through any kind of emotional weather . " You hurt your head , " she said . " Jerry Kilpatrick did . " " I admit I made a mistake about him . " " So did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do about Susan ? " " I do n't know what to do . " She stood above me sighing , leafing over the empty pages of the address book . " I 've talked to the girls she knows , including the ones in here . None of them were really friends . All they ever did together was go to school or play tennis . " " That was n't much of a life for an eighteen-year-old girl . " " I know that . I 've tried to promote things for her , but nothing worked . She was afraid . " 107  | " Afraid of what ? " " I do n't know , but it 's real . I 've been fearful all along that she 'd go on the run . And now she has . " I asked Mrs. Crandall to show me the girl 's room , if she did n't mind . " I do n't mind . But do n't mention it to Lester . He would n't like it . " She took me to a large room with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In spite of its size , the room seemed crowded . The bedroom furniture , ivory with gold trim , was matched by stereo and television sets and a girl 's work desk with a white telephone . The place suggested a pampered prisoner expected to live out her life in a single room . The walls were hung with mass-produced . psychedelic posters and pictures of young male singing groups which only seemed to emphasize the silence . There were no pictures or other traces of any actual people the girl might have known . " As you can see , " her mother said , " we gave her everything . But it was n't what she wanted . " She opened the wardrobe closet for my inspection . It was stuffed with coats and dresses like a small army of girls crushed flat for storage and smelling of sachet . The chest of drawers was full of sweaters and other garments , like shed or unused skins . The single drawer of the dressing table was jammed with cosmetics . There was a telephone directory lying open on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of it and switched on the fluorescent desk lamp . The directory was open to the motel section of the yellow pages , and at the bottom of the righthand page was a small advertisement for the Star Motel . I did n't think that this could be a coincidence , and I 1o8  | pointed it out to Mrs. Crandall . It suggested nothing to her . Neither did my description of Al . I asked her to give me a recent photograph of Susan . She took me into another room , which she called her sewing room , and produced a pocket-sized high school graduation picture . The clear-eyed blond girl in it looked as if she would never lose her purity or youth or grow old or die . " That 's the way I used to look , " her mother said . " There 's still a strong resemblance . " " You should have seen me when I was in high school . " She was n't boasting , exactly . But a little earthiness was asserting itself behind her careful manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where did you go to high school ? " " Santa Teresa . " " Is that why Susan went up there ? " " I doubt it . " " Do you have relatives in Santa Teresa ? " " Not any more . " She changed the subject . " If you get any word of Susan , will you let us know right away ? " I promised , and she handed me the picture as if to seal the bargain . I put it in my pocket along with the green-covered book , and left the house . The shadows of the palms lay like splash-marks of dark liquid on the pavement and across the roof of my car . 109  | The Star Motel stood with its rear end on pilings in a narrow crowded place between the highway and the sea . The lights of the all-night service station beside it shone on its yellow stucco walls and on the weathered " Vacancy " sign which hung on the office door . I went in and tapped the hand bell on the counter . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at me through his creased and sleepy face . " Single or double ? " I told him I was looking for a man , and I started to give him a description of Al . He cut me short with a shake of his frowzy head . An anger that floated like a pollution near the surface of his life came up in his throat and almost choked him . " You got no right to wake me up for that . This is a business establishment . " I laid two dollar bills on the counter . He sucked his anger back into his body and picked up the money . " Many thanks . Your friend and his wife are in room seven . " I showed him Susan 's picture . " Has she been here ? " " Maybe she has . " " You 've seen her or you have n't . " " What 's the rap ? " Ito  | " No rap . She 's just a floating girl . " " Are you her father ? " " Just a friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I think she was , a couple of days ago . I have n't seen her since . Anyway , " he said with a slanted grin , " you got your two dollars ' worth . " I left him and moved along the railed gallery . A high tide was slapping disconsolately at the pilings . The reflection of the neon from the service station floated on the water like iridescent waste . I knocked on the door and made its tin 7 rattle . The narrow band of light which rimmed the door widened as it opened . The woman behind it tried to close it again when she saw my face , but I put my arm and shoulder in the opening and slid inside . " Go away , " she said . " I only want to ask you a couple of questions . " " Sorry . I lost my memory . " She seemed to mean it literally . " Some days I ca n't remember my own name . " Her voice was flat . Her face was without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past expressions around the eyes and at the corners of the mouth . She looked both young and old . Her body was muffled in a quilted pink robe , and I could n't tell if she was a well-preserved middleaged woman or a dilapidated girl . Her eyes were the color of the darkness in the corners of the room . " What is your name ? " " Elegant . " " That 's a striking name . " " Thank you . I picked it one day when I was feeling that way . I have n't felt that way for quite some time now . " She looked around the room as if to blame her environment for this . The bedclothes were tangled and dragging on  | the floor . Empty bottles stood on the dresser among toothmarked pieces of old hamburgers . The chairs were hung with her discarded clothing . " Where 's Al ? " I said . " He should be back by now , but he is n't . " " What 's his last name ? " " Al Nesters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he from ? " " I 'm not supposed to tell anybody that . " " Why not ? " She made a vague impatient gesture . " You ask too bloody many questions . Who do you think you are ? " I did n't try to answer that . " How long ago did Al leave here ? " " Hours . I do n't know exactly . I do n't keep track of the time . " " Was he wearing his longhair wig and mustache and beard ? " She gave me a blank look . " He does n't wear any of those things . " " That you know of . " She showed a flicker of interest , even a little anger . " What is this ? Are you trying to tell me he 's doubletiming me ? " " He may be . When I saw him tonight , he was wearing a black wig and a beard to match . " " Where did you see him ? " " Northridge . " " Are you the man who promised him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was true in a way I was working for Stanley Broadhurst 's wife . But the statement made me feel as if I was mediating between two ghosts . Another flicker of interest appeared in her eyes . " Do you have the thousand for him ? " 112  | " Not that much . " " You could leave me what you have . " " I do n't think so . " " Enough for a bindle anyway . " " How much is that ? " " Twenty dollars would fix me up for tonight and all day tomorrow . " " I 'll think about it . I 'm not sure Al delivered on his side of the bargain . " " You know he did , if you 're with it . He 's been hanging around for days waiting to be paid off . How much longer do you expect him to wait ? " The answer was forever , but I did n't say it . " I 'm not sure what he did was worth a grand . " " Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Her vague eyes narrowed . " Are you sure you 're fronting for the money man ? What 's his nameBroadman ? " " Broadhurst . Stanley Broadhurst . " She relaxed on the edge of the bed . Before she got suspicious again , I showed her the photograph of Susan which Mrs. Crandall had given me . She looked at it with a kind of respectful envy and passed it back to me . " I was almost as pretty as that at one time , " she said . " I bet you were , Elegant . " The sound of her name pleased her , and she smiled . " Not so long ago as you might think . " " I can believe it . Do you know this girl ? " " I 've seen her once or twice . " " Recently ? " " I think so . I do n't keep good track of time , I 've got too much on my mind . But she was here in the last two or three days . " " What was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to ask Al . He made me go out and sit in the bug . Fortunately , I 'm not the jealous type , that 's one good quality I have . " " Did Al make love to her ? " " Maybe he did . I would n't put it past him . But mainly he was trying to get her to talk . He made me mix up some acid in a Coke . That was supposed to loosen her up . " " What did she talk about ? " " I would n't know . He took her away someplace , and that was the last I saw of her . But I guess it had to do with the Broadman business . Broadhurst ? That was what Al had on his mind all week . " " What day was she here ? Thursday ? " " I do n't remember offhand . I 'll try to figure it out . " Her lips moved in calculation , as if between that day and this she had crossed some sort of international dateline . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that for certain . He took me to San Francisco to answer the ad , and we spent Sunday night there and came down here on Monday . Or was it Tuesday ? What day is this again ? " " Saturday night . Early Sunday morning . " She counted on her fingers , the days and nights crossing her eyes like shadows . " I guess he made his contact Wednesday , " she said . " He came back here and said we could cross the border by Saturday at the latest . " She looked at me in sudden alienation . " Where is the money ? What happened to it ? " " It has n't been paid yet . " " When do we get it ? " " I do n't know . I do n't even know what Al was supposed to do for it . " " It 's simple enough , " she said . " There were this guy and this girl , and Al was supposed to locate them . You know that if you work for Broadhurst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " " But you 've seen the ad from the Chronicle , have n't you ? " " Not yet . Do you have a copy ? " I was moving too fast for her , and her face closed up . " Maybe I have and maybe I have n't . What do I get out of it ? " " I promise you 'll get something . But if the ad came out in the San Francisco Chronicle , a million people must have seen it . You might as well show it to me . " She considered this proposition . Then she got a worn suitcase out from under the bed , opened it , and handed me a folded and refolded clipping . It was a two-column ad about six inches high , reproducing the pictures I had found in Stanley Broadhurst 's rolltop desk . The accompanying text had been changed in part : Can you identify this couple ? Under the name of Mr. and Mrs. Ralph Smith , they arrived in San Francisco by car on or about July 5 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Honolulu aboard the Swansea Castle , which sailed from San Francisco July 6 , 1955 . But they may still be in the Bay area . A thousand-dollar reward will be paid for information leading to their present whereabouts . I turned to the woman who called herself Elegant . " Where are they ? " " Do n't ask me . " She shrugged , and the movement disarranged her robe . She pulled it close about her . " I think maybe I saw the woman . " " When ? " " I 'm trying to remember . " " What 's her name ? " " Al did n't tell me that . He did n't tell me anything , really . But we stopped at her house on the way down here , and I got a look at her face when she came to the door . She 's 115  | older now , but I 'm pretty sure it 's the same woman . " She considered the question further . " Maybe not , though . It seems to me Al got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ad ? " " That 's right . It does n't make sense , does it ? Maybe he was putting me on , or I 'm remembering wrong . " " Can you tell me where her house is ? " " That , " she said , " is worth money . " " How much do you want ? " " It says in the ad a thousand . If I took less , Al would kill me . " " Al wo n't be coming back here . " She met my eyes and held them . " You 're telling me he 's dead ? " " Yes . " She huddled on the edge of the bed , as if the knowledge of Al 's death had chilled her . " I never thought we 'd make it to Mexico . " She gave me a cold darting look , like a harmless snake . " Did you kill him ? " " No . " " The cops ? " " What makes you say that ? " " He was on the run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got to get out of here . " But she did n't move . " Where was he on the run from ? " " He broke out of prison . He talked about it once when he was high . I should have left him when I had the chance . " She stood up and made a frantic gesture . " What happened to my Volkswagen ? " " The cops probably have it by now . " " I 've got to get out of here . You take me out of here . " " No . You can take a bus . " She called me a few names , which did n't bother me . But when I moved toward the door , she followed . 1i6  | " How much money will you give me ? " " Nothing like a thousand . " " A hundred ? That would take me back to Sac . " " Are you from Sacramento ? " " My parents live there . But they do n't want to see me . " " What about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came out of an orphanage . " " Where ? " " Some city north of here . We stopped there on the way down . He pointed out the orphanage to me . " " You stopped at the orphanage ? " " You 're all mixed up , " she said with condescension . " He showed me the orphanage when we passed it on the highwaywe did n't stop there . We stopped in town to get some money for gas and food . " " What town ? " " One of those Santa places . Santa Teresa , I think it was . " " And how did you get the money for gas ? " " Al got it from a little old lady . She gave him twenty dollars . Al 's very big with little old ladies . " " Can you describe her ? " " I du n no . She was just a little old lady in a little old house on a little old street . It was kind of a pretty street , with purple flowers in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Flowering jacarandas , yeah . " " Was her name Mrs. Snow ? " " I think that was the name . " " What about the woman in the ad ? Where does she live ? " A look of stupid cunning took hold of her face . " That 's worth money . That 's what it 's all about . " " I 'll give you fifty . " " Let me see it . " 117  | I got out my wallet and gave her the fifty-dollar bill that Fran Armistead had tipped me with . I was sort of glad to get rid of it , though here again I was conscious of buying and being sold at the same time , as if I 'd made a down payment on the room and its occupant . She kissed the money . " I can really use it , it 's my ticket out of here . " But she looked around the room as if it was a recurrent nightmare she had . " You were going to tell me where the woman lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and uncomfortable about it . She forced herself to say : " She lives in this big old house in the woods . " " You 're making this up . " " I am not . " " What woods are you talking about ? " " It 's on the Peninsula someplace . I did n't pay good attention on the way . I was strung out on an Einstein trip . " " Einstein trip ? " " When you go all the way out , past the last star , and space loops back on you . " " Where on the Peninsula ? " She shook her head , the way you shake a watch that has stopped ticking . " I ca n't remember . There 's all these little cities strung together . I ca n't remember which one . " " What did the house look like ? " " It was very old , two-storiedthree-storied . And it had two little round towers , one on each side . " She erected her thumbs . " What color ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked kind of grayish green through the trees . " " What kind of trees ? " " Oak trees , " she said , " and some pines . But mostly oak trees . " I18  | I waited for a while . " What else do you remember about the place ? " " That 's about all . I was n't really there , you know . I was out around Arcturus , looking down . Oh yeah , there was a dog running around under the trees . A Great Dane . He had a beautiful voice . " She woofed in imitation . " Did he belong to the house ? " " I do n't know . I do n't think so . He acted lost , I remember thinking that . Will that help ? " " I do n't know . What day was it ? " " Sunday , I think . I said it was Sunday , did n't I , that we left Sac ? " " You have n't given me much for my fifty . " She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You could make love to me if you want . " Not waiting for my answer , she stood up and dropped the pink robe to the floor . Her body was young , high-breasted , narrow-waisted , almost too slender . But there were bruises on her arms and thighs like the hash-marks of hard service . She was a dilapidated girl . She looked up into my face . I do n't know what she saw there , but she said : " Al roughed me up quite a bit . He was pretty wild after all that time in prison . I guess you do n't want me , do you ? " " Thanks , I 've had a hard day . " " And you wo n't take me with you ? " " No . " I gave her my business card and asked her to call me collect if she remembered anything more . " I doubt I will . I 've got a mind like a sieve . " " Or if you need help . " " I always need help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I think I can stand it . " Leaning her hands on my shoulders , she raised herself on her toes and brushed my mouth with her sad mouth . 119  | I went outside and folded Stanley Broadhurst 's ad into the green-covered book and locked up both of them in the trunk of my car . Then I drove home to West Los Angeles . Before I went to bed I called my answering service . Arnie Shipstad had left a message for me . The man whose body I 'd found in Stanley Broadhurst 's house was a recent escapee from Folsom named Albert Sweetner , with a record of a dozen or so arrests . His first arrest occurred in Santa Teresa , California . It was late at night , almost halfway to morning . I knocked myself out with a heavy slug of whisky and went to bed . In the dream that took over my sleeping mind I was due to arrive someplace in a very short time . But when I went out to my car it had no wheels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it like a snail in a shell and watched the night world go by . The light coming through the bedroom blind changed from gray to off-white and woke me . I lay and listen : * , to the early traffic . A few birds peeped . At full dawn the jays began to squawk and divebomb my window . I 'd forgotten the jays . Their sudden raucous reminder turned me cold under the sheet . I threw it off and got up and put on my clothes . 120  | There was a last can of peanuts in the kitchen cupboard . I scattered the peanuts out the window and watched the jays come swooping into the yard . It was like watching a flashing blue explosion-in-reverse that put the morning world together again . But the central piece was missing . I shaved and went out for breakfast and kept going . Miles below Santa Teresa , sooner than I expected , the fire came into view above the freeway . It had burned southward and eastward along the mountains , which were black and rimmed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in from the sea the night before seemed to be holding it back from the coastal plain and the city . The wind was still coming from the sea . Where the freeway looped close to the water I could see the white spume drifting up from the shore and hear the surf crashing . I stopped at the Armistead beach house . The tide was high , and the broken water slid up the beach and wet the pilings that the house stood on . I knocked at the second-floor entrance at the rear . Fran Armistead came to the door wearing men 's pajamas . Her face was swollen with sleep . Her hair was sticking up like ruffled feathers . " Do I know you ? " she said not unpleasantly . " Archer , " I prompted her . " I brought your car back . We were fellow-refugees from the fire . " " Of course . It 's rather fun being a refugee , is n't it ? " " Maybe the first time . Is your husband here ? " " I 'm afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Do you know where ? " " He 's probably at the marina . Roger 's dreadfully upset about his boat . When Mr. Kilpatrick phoned him this morning , he did n't even know that it was gone . " 121  | " I take it it has n't been heard from . " " It had n't been when he left here . Roger 's terribly angry with the Kilpatrick boy . I do n't know what he 'll do to him when he catches him . " " Were Roger and Jerry Kilpatrick pretty close ? " She gave me a hard look . " Not in the way you mean . Roger is terribly masculine . " She shivered , and hugged herself . I drove to the marina and parked in the almost deserted public lot . It was still very early in the morning . I could see through the wire fence that Ariadne 's slip was still empty . Roger Armistead was standing on the float , looking out to sea in an attitude that seemed consciously statuesque . Brian Kilpatrick was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remote , yet tensely conscious of each other , as if they had quarreled . Kilpatrick saw me at the gate . He came up the gangplank and let me through . He was wearing the same clothes , and he looked as if he had slept in them , or tried to . " Armistead 's in a filthy mood , I warn you , " Kilpatrick said . " He blames me for this mess . Hell , I 've barely seen Jerry in the last couple of months . He 's been running out of my control . Armistead practically adopted him . I ca n't assume responsibility . " But he moved his heavy shoulders as if the weight of his son was strapped to his back . " Where would Jerry take the boat ? Do you have any idea ? " " I 'm afraid I do n't . I 'm not a yachtsman . Which is one of the reasons Jerry took up sailing . If I 'd been interested in the sea , he 'd have gone in for golf . " Kilpatrick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice was querulous . " North or south ? " I said . 122  | " Probably south . Those are the waters he knew . Maybe out to the islands . " He pointed to the offshore islands which lay on the horizon like blue whales . In the twenty-mile span between them and the shore , there was nothing visible on the surface of the water . " Have you informed the sheriff ? " He looked at me in some embarrassment . " Not yet . " " You said you were going to talk to him last night . " " I tried to , honestly . He was out on the fire line . As a matter of fact he still is . " " There must be other officers on duty . " " There are some . But all they can think about is the fire . They 're involved in a major catastrophe , you know . " " So is Jerry . " " You do n't have to tell me that . He 's my son . " He gave me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , early this morning . I gather you went to see him after all . " " What did he have to say ? " " He blames the whole thing on Jerry , naturally . Boys always get the blame where a girl 's concerned . According to Crandall 's version , his daughter never caused them any trouble at all , until now . That 's hard to believe . " " He may believe it . He and his wife seem to be slightly out of touch . " My mind came up with a stereoscopic view of the girl alone in her white room at home , and the girl at the Star Motel with Al Sweetner . " I wish you had n't gone to Crandall , " Kilpatrick said in an aggrieved voice . " It complicates things . He could make things rough for me if he wanted to . " " I 'm sorry . I have to follow my case where it leads . " " It 's your case , is it ? " " I 'm willing to share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll go and find your friend the sheriff . How about it ? " 14 123  | " If you say so . " I left Kilpatrick at the gate and spoke to Armistead 's back . He turned deliberately . He looked both sad and angry in a strangled inexpressive way . He was wearing a yachting cap and blazer , and an ascot at his throat . " Why did n't you tell me about this , last night ? Now we may never get her back . " Armistead sounded as if he was talking about a woman he had lost , or the dream of a woman . " She could be a hundred miles from here by now , or at the bottom of the sea . " " Have you told the Coast Guard ? " " Yes I have . They 'll keep an eye out for her . But they 're not exactly in the business of tracking down stolen boats . " " This is n't a simple case of theft , " I said . " I guess you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Kilpatrick told me that . " Armistead 's eyes narrowed and seemed to fasten on an ugly vision . He rubbed his knuckles in the sockets of his eyes , and turned his back on me again . The waves were coming over the breakwater , shattering in green streaming water . Even the water in the marina was unquiet , lifting the float under our feet and letting it fall . The world was changing , as if with one piece missing the whole thing had come loose and was running wild . Armistead walked out to the seaward end of the float . I followed him . He was a closed man , but I thought he might be getting more ready to open . " I understand Jerry 's a pretty good friend of yours . " " He was . I do n't want to talk about it . " I went on anyway . " I do n't blame you for being browned off . I feel the same way . He hit me over the head with a revolver last night . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , after some hesitation : " I kept a .38 on the boat . " " And I suppose he took it with him ? " " I suppose he did . I 'm not responsible . " " That 's what Kilpatrick says , too . Nobody 's responsible . The thing I 'm trying to get at is Jerry 's motivation . What do you think he 's trying to accomplish ? " " Pure destruction , for all I know . " " I hope not . " " He broke faith with me . " Armistead sounded resentful and betrayed , like a sailor who had come to the edge of a flat world . " I trusted him with my boat . I let him live aboard her all summer . " " Why ? " " He needed a place . I do n't mean just a place to live . A place in the scheme of things . And I thought the sea would do it for him . " He paused . " I was a yacht bum when I was Jerry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want the truth . I could n't stand life ashore any more than Jerry could . All I ever wanted was to get outside " his arm swept seaward " and be with the wind and the water . You know , the sea and the sky . " Like many divided and inarticulate men , Armistead had an old-fashioned poetic streak . I tried to keep him talking . " Where did you live when you were a boy ? " " Near Newport . That 's where I met my wife . I used to crew for her first husband . " " Jerry is supposed to have met Susan Crandall in Newport . " " He may have . We sailed down there in June . " I showed him the girl 's picture , but he shook his head . " So far as I know , he never brought a girl aboardher or any other girl . " " Until Thursday ? " 125  | " That 's correct . " " What happened Thursday night ? I 'd like to get it straight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the girl got high on something . She climbed the mast and dove into the water . She barely missed one of the pilings . This was about dawn on Friday morning . " " I understand Jerry 's on drugs . " His face closed up . " I would n't know . " " His father admits he 's been using them . " Armistead glanced toward the gate . Kilpatrick was still there . " A lot of people use them , " he said . " The question may be important . " " All right . I tried to discourage it , but he was using pep pills and other dangerous drugs . It 's one of the reasons I let him live aboard . " " I do n't understand . " " He was less likely to get into trouble on the boat . At least , that was my theory . " His face turned sullen again . " You 're fond of the boy . " " I tried to be a father to him , or a big brother . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was a good one , in spite of the drugs . What makes them so important ? " " I think the girl Susan had some- kind of a breakdown . And she may have killed a man yesterday . Have you heard about the murder ? " " No , I have n't . " " The victim was a man named Stanley Broadhurst . " " I know a Mrs. Broadhurst who lives here . " " She 's his mother . Do you know her well ? " " We do n't know anyone here really well . The ones I know best are the harbor people . Fran has her own friends . " 126  | He glanced around the harbor restlessly like a sailor who had gone to sea in his youth and never moved back ashore . He looked at the town with uncomprehending eyes . It hung like a city made of fog or smoke between the restless sea and the black mountains . " I 'm not connected with any of this , " Armistead said . " Except through Jerry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with as far as I 'm concerned . " I could have told him that it was n't that easy . Jerry 's real father seemed to know it already . Kilpatrick was standing inside the wire gate . He looked at me like a suspect waiting to be released . " Armistead 's bitter , is n't he ? He 'll throw the book at Jerry . " " That I doubt . He 's more let down than angry . " " I 'm the one that 's really let down , " Kilpatrick said competitively . I changed the subject . " Do you know where Sheriff Tremaine is this morning ? " " I know where he was an hour agoat the main fire camp on the college grounds . " Kilpatrick volunteered to take me up there . Driving a new 127  | black Cadillac , he led me in my not-so-recent Ford to the eastern edge of the city and onto a county road which climbed into the foothills through areas where the fire had been and gone . Just before we reached the campus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trucks and tractors were being repaired . We were stopped at double iron gates which stood open between iron gateposts . A brass sign was bolted to one post : Santa Teresa College . The ranger who stopped us knew Kilpatrick and told us to drive on throughthe sheriff was on the athletic field with the fire boss . Joe Kelsey , whom I also asked him about , had passed that way not long before in a deputy coroner 's truck . Kilpatrick and I parked behind the bleachers that overlooked the athletic field . Before I left my car I got the green-covered book out of the trunk and put it in my jacket pocket . We made our way among official cars and trucks that had assembled from all over Southern California , from the Tehachapis in the north to the Mexican border . The athletic field resembled a staging area just back of the lines in a major battle . On the grass oval inside the cinder track , bubble copters were landing and taking off with reinforcements . Undisturbed by their din , smoke-jumpers lay on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky . There were men of every color thereIndians and blacks and weathered whiteshard-nosed , stoic , working stiffs with nothing to lose but their bedrolls and their lives . We found Sheriff Tremaine in the main command post , which was a plain gray Forest Service trailer . The sheriffcoroner was a big-bellied man wearing a tan uniform and a Stetson . The flesh of his face hung in folds like a bloodhound 's dewlaps and made his smile a strange and complex 128  | thing . He gave Kilpatrick an old-fashioned politician 's handshake , with his left hand on the elbow as he pumped . " What can I do for you , Brian ? " Kilpatrick cleared his throat . His voice came out tinny and uncertain . " My son Jerry 's in a spot of trouble . He 's taken Roger Armistead 's sloop and gone to sea with a girl . " The Sheriff smiled his complicated smile . " It does n't sound so serious . He 'll come back . " " I was hoping you could alert the people up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two of me . Take it up with the men at the courthouse , Brian . We 're planning to move base within twenty-four hours . And on top of everything else , I hear we 've got a dead man on our hands . " " Stanley Broadhurst ? " I said . " Yessir . Do you know him ? " " I was with Joe Kelsey when his body was found . The girl that Mr. Kilpatrick is talking about is a material witness in that killing . And she and Jerry have Stanley Broadhurst 's son with them . " Tremaine became more attentive , but he seemed too tired to react fully . " What do the two of you want me to do ? " " Put out an all-points alarm , as Kilpatrick suggested , with emphasis on the coastal cities and seaports . The missing boat is a sloop named Ariadne ' . " I spelled it out . " Do you have an aero-squadron ? " " I have , but the volunteer pilots are up to their necks . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the islands . They may have anchored out there . " From where I stood I could see the islands , embossed on the slanting sea . " I 'll consider it , " the sheriff said . " If there 's anything else , you can take it up with Joe Kelsey . He has the full cooperation of my office . " 129  | " There 's one other thing , sheriff , " He bowed his head in weary patience . I produced the green-covered book and got out Stanley Broadhurst 's ad from the San Francisco Chronicle . The sheriff took the clipping in his hands and studied it . Kilpatrick moved to his shoulder and looked at it , too . The two men lifted their eyes at the same time and exchanged a glance of dubious recognition . " The man is Leo Broadhurst , of course , " the sheriff said . " Who 's the woman , Brian ? Your eyes are better than mine . " Kilpatrick swallowed . " My wife , " he said . " My ex-wife , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where is she now ? " " I have no idea . " The sheriff handed the clipping back to me . " Is this connected with Stanley Broadhurst 's death ? " " I think so . " I started to tell Tremaine something about the background of the case , and the dead man Al . He waved me into silence . " Take it up with somebody else . Take it up with Kelsey . Will you do me that favor , both of you ? The fire boss expects to be out of here before noon tomorrow , and I 'm helping him plan the move . " " Where are you moving to ? " Kilpatrick said . " Buckhorn Meadow , about sixteen miles east of here . " " Does that mean that the city is out of danger ? " " I think it should be by tomorrow , anyway . But the worst is yet to come . " He looked up at the bare black slope of the mountain above us . " The first real rain , and we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door of the trailer . As he levered his bulk through the narrow opening , I caught a glimpse of 130  | a tall man in a Forest Service jacket bowed over a map . He had a graying Scandinavian head , and he looked like a Viking trying to navigate a sea of land . I turned to Kilpatrick . " You did n't tell me Leo Broadhurst ran away with your wife . " " I told you last night she left me . I do n't usually bare my bosom to strangers . " " Is she still with Broadhurst ? " " I would n't know about that . They do n't report to me . " " Did you divorce her ? " " She divorced me soon after she left here . " " And married him ? " " I assume so . They did n't send me a wedding invitation . " " Where did she divorce you ? " " In Nevada . " " Where is she nowin the Bay area ? " " I have n't the slightest notion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll change the subject . " But he could n't leave it alone . Anger or some other emotion was running through him in a gross vibration which made his voice tremble . " That was a dirty trick you pulled on me just now , showing that picture to Sheriff Tremaine . " " What was dirty about it ? " " It put me on the spot in front of him . You could at least have brought it up in private . You did n't have to shoot me down in public . " " I 'm sorry . I did n't know it was your wife . " He gave me a look of disbelief so naked that it made me question myself . Perhaps I had had a hunch just below the level of consciousness . " Let me have another look at that picture , " he said . I handed him the clipping . He stood and examined it , 131  | oblivious of the action around him and the clatter of helicopters overhead , like a man on the rim of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked up , his face had been changed by it . It seemed older and more defensive . He gave me back the clipping . " Where did you get this ? From Jerry ? " " No . " " Did Stanley Broadhurst put that ad in the Chronicle ? " " Apparently , " I said . " Have you seen it before ? " " I may have . I do n't remember if I did . " " Then how would you know it was printed in the Chronicle ? " He answered smoothly : " I simply took it for granted . The styling looks like the Chronicle . " After a moment 's intense thought , he added : " San Francisco is mentioned in the text . " It was too good an answer , but I let it pass . " What made you ask if I got the ad from your son Jerry ? " " It was just a thought , " he said with a one-sided grimace . " Jerry 's been very much on my mind , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Francisco is the center of the known world . " " Did Jerry see a copy of this ad ? " " He may have . How would I know ? " " I think you do know , Kilpatrick . " " I do n't give a damn what you think . " He brought up his clenched fist , ready to swing at me . I got ready to block it . He pulled his fist in to his chest and looked down at it as if it was a small animal which had momentarily got out of control . Then he turned abruptly and went behind the bleachers , moving in hurried uncertainty as if he was going to be sick . I went after him at a little distance . He was leaning against a supporting post with his head hanging . The look I surprised on his face was one of terrible disappointment . 132  | He straightened up and put on an expression of weary patience which fitted the lines of his face . " You 're giving me a hard time , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're a hard man to get information from . " " Really ? I 've practically told you my life story . It is n't all that interesting . " " I think it is . You 've as good as admitted that Jerry saw a copy of this ad . It could explain a number of things . " " I 'm not admitting anything , but give me a for-instance . " " He may have got in touch with Stanley Broadhurst and helped to stir him up . " " Stanley did n't need any stirring up . He 's been hipped on this subject for years . He never forgave his father for leaving him and his mother . " " Did you ever discuss it with Stanley ? " " Yes , I did . " " Did you tell him that your wife ran off with his father ? " " I did n't have to . He knew it very well . Everyone knew it . " " Who do you mean by everyone ' ? " " All the people concerned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least most people have forgotten it by now . " Kilpatrick was beginning to look sick again . " Could n't we forget it , too ? It is n't my favorite subject . " " How does Jerry feel about it ? " " He blames meI told you that . It suits him to believe that his mother left me because I deserved it . " " Has he ever visited her ? " " Not to my knowledge . You do n't quite understand the situation . Ellen left me fifteen years ago and cut off all contact . The last word I had from her was her divorce notice , and that came from her lawyer in Reno . " " What was the lawyer 's name ? " " I could n't tell you at this late date . " 133  | I got out the green-covered book again , opened it to the flyleaf , and showed Kilpatrick the bookplate with the peacock-plume engraving . " Ellen Strome was your ex-wife 's maiden name , I gather . " " Yes . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get this book ? " " She left it in the house . She left a lot of her things behind . " " Why did she go so abruptly ? " " It was n't so abrupt . I saw it coming . She did n't really like me , and she did n't like my business . I was just another real estate salesman in those days . She did n't approve of my seven-day week , with the phone ringing all the time and having to be nice to little old ladies from Dubuque . Ellen wanted something more refined . More romantic . " His voice was laced with sarcasm and regret . " Is that what Leo Broadhurst wasromantic ? " " I would n't know , I 'm not a woman . Broadhurst did n't come in on my wave-length that way . " " How did he come in ? " " He went for women the way some men go deer-hunting pitting his skills , you know ? Ellen should n't have taken him so seriously . Neither should his son Stanley . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there was some deep significance to his father 's affair . He wanted to find his father and get an explanation out of him . " " Who killed Stanley ? " Kilpatrick lifted his heavy shoulders and let them drop . " Who knows ? I doubt that the murder 's connected with that old business . " " It almost has to be , " I said . Kilpatrick looked at me levelly . A kind of angry brotherhood had been growing between us . It was partly based on 134  | the fact , which he did n't know , that my wife had walked out on me and sent me divorce papers through a lawyer . And partly that we were two middle-aging men , and three young people had slipped away over the curve of the world . " Okay , " he said . " Jerry saw the ad in the Chronicle . That was around the end of June . He recognized his mother from her pictures , and he seemed to think I should do something about it . I told him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mother 's choice to walk out on us . We could n't do anything now but try to forget it . " " What was his reaction ? " " He walked out on me , too . But you know all this . " Kilpatrick seemed to be losing interest in his own life . He got into his car and headed back toward the gate . I walked in the opposite direction , to the western side of the college grounds . From the edge of the mesa a path meandered downhill toward the decimated grove where the fire had started . I could see a panel truck there , and two men moving around it , small in the distance . One of them moved with clumsy speed , like Kelsey . I went down the path , which passed through burned-out areas in the brush . A firebreak had been bulldozed along a 135  | line that ran roughly parallel with the path , and below it . There were places where the fire had jumped the firebreak , but it had been put out on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The live body of the fire , when I looked back , seemed to be far up the mountainside and moving away eastward . The hillside path was littered with black sticks and gray ashes . Stepping carefully among the leavings of the fire , I worked my way down to the broad shelf where the Broadhurst family 's mountain cabin had stood . It had been built of wood , and there was virtually nothing left but several sets of bedsprings , a stove , a blackened tin sink . I passed the place where the stable had been . The burnedout body of Stanley 's convertible was sitting in the open , its tireless rims sunk in the ashes of the building . It looked like a relic of an ancient civilization , ruined and diminished by the passage of centuries , already half buried among their droppings . The panel truck had a sheriff-coroner 's decal on the side . It was parked in the lane that led up to the ridge road . There was someone in the cab , but the morning glare on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truck , through the denuded trees , I could see a uniformed man digging and Kelsey watching him . There was a pile of dirt between them . A deja vu feeling gave me a twinge of basic doubt , as if the burial and the digging-up might be repeated daily from now on . Jean Broadhurst got down out of the truck and lifted her hand to me . She had on the same mod clothes as the day before , and against the surreal background of burned trees she looked more than ever like a lost and widowed Columbine . She was wearing no makeup . Even her mouth was pale . 136  | " I did n't expect to see you here , " I said . " They asked me to come with them and identify Stanley 's body . " " They 're a little late about getting to it , are n't they ? " " Mr. Kelsey could n't get a deputy coroner here until now . But it does n't matter to Stanley . And it does n't matter to me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and on the edge . I wanted to tell her I had seen her son , but I could n't think of a way that would n't scare her . I asked her how her mother-in-law was doing . " She 's suffering from exhaustion . But Dr. Jerome says she has great recuperative powers . " " Does she remember about this ? " I motioned toward the digging . " I do n't really know . The doctor told me not to bring up anything painful , which rather tends to limit the conversation . " Jean was trying hard to sustain a style . But the effort she was making had the effect of silencing me . We stood and looked at each other in embarrassment , as if we shared some guilty knowledge . " I caught a glimpse of Ronny last night , " I said . " What are you trying to tell me ? That he 's dead ? " Her somber eyes were ready for any horror . " He was very much alive . " I told her where , and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night ? " " I was hoping to bring you better news . " " That means there is n't any . " " At least he is n't dead , and there was no sign that he was being mistreated . " " But why did they take him ? What are they trying to do ? " " That is n't clear . It 's a complex case involving a number of 137  | people , and at least one known criminal . Do you remember the man who came to your house in Northridge yesterday ? " " The one who wanted money ? How could I forget him ? " " He came back later and broke into your house . I found him dead in your husband 's study last night . " " Dead ? " " Somebody knifed him . Does anyone besides your family have access to your house ? " " No , not anyone . " She was trying to comprehend this second death . " Is his body still in the house ? " " No , it was taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is pretty much of a shambles . " " It hardly matters , " she said . " I 've decided not to go back to that house , ever . " " This is a poor time to make a decision . " " It 's the only time I have . " The rhythmic sound of spading had ceased in the grove , and Jean turned toward the sudden emptiness . The digging man was almost out of sight in the hole . Like a man growing laboriously out of the earth , he stood up with Stanley 's body clasped in his arms . He and Kelsey laid the body on a stretcher and brought it toward us through the naked tree trunks . Jean watched it come as if she dreaded its arrival . But when they laid it on the tail-gate of the truck she walked steadily toward it and looked down without flinching into the dirt-filled eyes . She pushed the dead man 's hair back and bent over to kiss his forehead . The action had a heightened reality , as if she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her husband for some time . Kelsey did n't question her or disturb her . He introduced me to the deputy coroner , a serious-faced young man named Vaughan Purvis . " What killed him , Mr. Purvis ? The pickax wounds ? " 138  | " I 'd say the pickax wounds were secondary . He was stabbed in the side with a sharp instrument , probably a knife . " " Has the knife been found ? " " No , but I plan to make a further search . " " I do n't think you 'll find it here . " I told Purvis and Kelsey about the dead man I 'd found in Stanley 's house in Northridge . Kelsey said he 'd be getting in touch with Arnie Shipstad . Deputy Purvis , who had been listening quietly , broke into unexpectedly emotional speech : " It looks like a conspiracy , probably the Mafia at work . " I said that I doubted the Mafia was involved . Kelsey pretended delicately not to have heard him . " Then what do you make of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stabbed him and drove that pickax into the back of his head ? Who dug that grave for him ? " " The blond girl is a prime suspect , " I said experimentally . " I do n't believe it , " Purvis said . " This ground is heavy adobe , and it 's dryalmost like brick . That hole went down at least four feet . I do n't believe any girl could have chopped it out . " " She may have had an accomplice . Or Stanley Broadhurst may have dug it himself . He was the one who borrowed the tools from the gardener . " Purvis looked puzzled . " Why would a man dig his own grave ? " " He may not have known it was going to be his , " I said . " You do n't think he was planning to kill his son , " Purvis said , " like Abraham with Isaac in the Bible ? " Kelsey let out a sardonic laugh , and Purvis went red with embarrassment . He trudged back toward the grave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hearing , Kelsey said : 139  | " The gardener may be lying about the tools . He may have come up here and used them himself . Do n't forget he lent the girl his car , and lied about it . " " Fritz is still on your list of suspects , then . " Kelsey scratched at his short gray hair . " He has to be . I 've been doing a little digging into his record . " " He has a record ? " " Not much of a one , but in my book it 's significant . When Fritz was in his late teens he was convicted of a sex crime . It was a first offenseat least that was known ofand the judge allowed him juvenile status and sent him to the county forestry camp . " " What crime did he commit ? " " Statutory rape . I 'm particularly interested , because these sex incidents sometimes crop up in the histories of firebugs . I 'm not saying Fritz is a firebugI have no evidence for that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he even helped put out a couple of fires in the back country . " " Is that bad ? " " It 's indicative , " Kelsey said gravely . " Do n't quote me to any firemenas a matter of fact , I used to be one myself but firemen and firebugs are sometimes brothers under the skin . They 're both fascinated by fires . Apparently Fritz Snow was so fascinated that when he got out of camp he went to work for the Forest Service . " " I 'm surprised they took him . " " He had some pretty good backing . Captain Broadhurst and his wife went to bat for him . The Forest Service did n't make a fireman out of him , but they gave him some training and a job running a bulldozer . As a matter of fact , he helped to build that trail . " Kelsey pointed toward the trail which went down the side of the bluff into the canyon . " Fritz and his crewmates did a fair jobit 's still in pretty good shape 140 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long in the Forest Service . Too many personal problems , to put it mildly . " " Did they fire him on account of his personal problems ? " " I do n't know why they fired him . There 's no notation in the file , and it was before my time . " " Fritz could tell you . " " Yeah . But it is n't going to be easy . Yesterday afternoon , when I tried to talk to him again , his mother would n't let me back into the house . She defends that hopeless son of hers like a wildcat . " " Maybe she 'll let me in . I want to talk to her anyway . The dead man in Northridge , Al Sweetner , picked up some money from Mrs. Snow last week . " " How much money ? " " We 'll have to ask her . " I looked at my watch . " It 's tenfifteen now . Can you meet me out in front of her house at eleven ? " " I 'm afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to get in on the preliminary examination of this body . You go and talk to Fritz . There has to be a reason for all the fear he has in him . " Kelsey 's voice was cool and rather uncomprehending . He talked about fear as if he had never experienced that emotion . Perhaps the reason for his being a fire investigator , I thought , was a puzzled need to understand what made emotional types like Fritz commit their hot foolish crimes . " Who was the girl he raped ? " " I do n't know who she was . The case was handled in Juvenile Court , and the record of it is sealed . I picked up my information from the old-timers at the courthouse . " 141  | Jean was looking down into her husband 's face as if she wondered how it felt to be dead . When Purvis came marching back , with his spade over his shoulder , she gave a start and turned away . Purvis set the spade down quietly and carefully . He unbuttoned the breast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folder with Stanley 's name printed in gold inside . It contained his driver 's license and other identification , a number of credit cards and membership cards , and three dollar bills . " He did n't have much left , " the young man said . I was struck by the feeling in his voice . " Did you know Stanley Broadhurst ? " " I knew him just about all my life , starting back in grade school . " " I thought he went to private school . " " He did , after he left grade school . He had some kind of trouble that summer , and his mother put him in a special school . " " The summer his father went away ? " " That 's right . Stanley had a lot of bad luck in his life . " He spoke with a certain awe . " I used to envy him back there in grade school . His people were rich , and we were as poor as Job 's turkey . But I 'll never envy him again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had wandered off in the direction of the stable , and seemed to be searching for a means of escape . She reminded me of the frightened doe I had seen the day before , but there was no fawn with her . When I reached her , she was standing beside the incinerated car . " Was this ours ? " " I 'm afraid so . " " Do you have transportation , Mr. Archer ? I 've got to get out of here . " " Where do you want to go ? " " Elizabeth 's house . I spent the night at the hospital . " I told Kelsey where we were going and said I might see him later , in the pathology department of the hospital . Jean and I started up the hillside path . She took the lead , moving quickly , like a woman trying to climb out of the present . Near the bleachers where my car was parked , a number of plywood tables had been set up on trestles . A hundred or more men were seated at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Most of the men looked up as we passed . Some whistled ; a few cheered . Jean kept going , her head down . She climbed into my car as if she was being pursued . " It 's my fault , " she said in self-loathing . " I should n't be wearing these clothes . " We drove a long way around through the outskirts of the city . I tried to question her about her husband , but she was unresponsive . She sat with her head down , deep in her own thoughts . When we entered Mrs. Broadhurst 's canyon , she straightened up and began to look around her . The fire had come down nearly as far as the entrance to the canyon and left its scorch-marks on the trees and on the hillside brush . Most of the houses in Canyon Estates were untouched . A few had been burned , as if picked out at random . There 143  | was nothing left of one house but a stone fireplace and a statue of Venus standing up out of rubble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poking among the ruins . The random pattern of the fire persisted as we went further into the canyon . Mrs. Broadhurst 's avocado trees seemed unharmed , but the olive trees beyond them had burned black . The eucalyptus trees that towered over the tile roof of the house had lost most of their branches and all their leaves . The barn had burned . The house itself was scorched but intact . Jean had a key , and we went in together . The closed house was full of the bitter smell of fire , and seemed abandoned . The worn Victorian furniture looked ready for the junk heap . Even the mounted birds in their glass cases looked as if they had seen better days . An acorn woodpecker had only one glass eye . The breasts of the robins had faded . They looked like imitation birds made to lend life to a dead and scruffy world . " Excuse me , " Jean said . " I 've got to find something black . " She disappeared into the other wing of the house . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detective who had worked with me on other cases . Looking for a telephone , I went into a kind of den adjoining the living room . There were ancestral tintypes on the walls . A man with mutton chop whiskers and a high winged collar glared at me from a black frame , as if daring me to make something of his whiskers . His look reminded me of Mrs. Broadhurst , but it did n't help me to understand her . I had seen her young and forceful , then sick and doddering . I needed something to fill up the gap between those versions of her , something that would explain why her husband had left her or why her son had n't been able to . 144  | The room contained among other things a black leather couch which made me want to lie down , and a kneehole desk made of burnished cherrywood . There was a telephone on the desk , sitting on top of a worn leather folder . I sat down at the desk , with my knees snug in the kneeholes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Francisco . The girl on duty switched me to his apartment on the top floor of his building . Another girl answered in a less businesslike voice , and then Willie came to the phone . " Call me back , Lew . You caught me in the midst of the act of love . " " You call inc . " I read off Mrs. Broadhurst 's phone number to him . Then I lifted the phone and opened the leather folder under it . There were several sheets of foolscap in the folder , and a faded map drawn in ink on creased and yellowing paper . The map showed about half of the Santa Teresa coastal plain ; roughly penned in at the back of it were foothills and mountains resembling thumb-prints and paw-prints . In the upper righthand corner of the map , someone had written : U.S. Land Commission Robert Driscoll Falconer Ex Mission Santa Teresa Filed in office June 14 , 1866 John Berry The top sheet of foolscap was covered with Spencerian handwriting . Under the heading " Memories , ' by Elizabeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ County Historical Society has asked me to set down some notes concerning my family . My paternal grandfather , Robert Driscoll Falconer , was the son of a Massa-145  | chusetts scholar and businessman and a student and disciple of Louis Agassiz . Robert Driscoll Falconer fought in the Union Army and on May 3 , 1863 , was wounded , almost mortally , at the Battle of Chancellorsville . But he lived to tell me about it in his old age . He came to the Pacific Coast to recuperate from his injuries and acquired , in part through purchase but chiefly through marriage , a holding of several thousand acres which became known as Falconer Ranch . Much of this ranch was originally part of the Mission Lands , secularized in 1834 and becoming part of a Mexican Land Grant which passed by way of my grandmother to my grandfather , and thence to my father , Robert Falconer , Jr . It is difficult for me to write objectively about my late father . He was the third in the male line of Falconers to attend Harvard College @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rancher or businessman . My father has been criticized for dissipating some of the family holdings . His reply would be that he had more important things to do with his life . He became a noted amateur ornithologist , author of the first checklist of native species to be found in the Santa Teresa region . His rich collection of skins both local and exotic became the nucleus of the bird collection of the Santa Teresa Museum . At this point the Spencerian writing began to deteriorate : I have heard false rumors that my father was a wanton killer of songbirds and that he killed them because he loved to kill . Nothing could be further from the truth ! He killed birds only for scientific reasons , in order to preserve the evanescent beauty of their markings . He loved the colorful little fliers which science compelled him to shoot . I can attest to this from personal observation . I accompanied my father on many of his expeditions here and abroad , and many were the times I came upon him weeping openly over the perforated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 146  | held in his kind masculine hand . Sometimes we wept together , he and I , hid in some wooded recess of our home canyon . He was a good man and a crack shot , and when he bestowed the gift of death he did so instantly , painlessly , with no mistake about it . Robert Driscoll Falconer , Jr. , was a god come down to earth in human guise . Toward the end , the handwriting went to pieces . It straggled across the lined yellow page like a defeated army . I started to go through the drawers of the desk . The top one on the righthand side was stuffed with bills . Some of them had been unpaid for months and had special little messages written across them : " Immediate payment will be appreciated , " " In case of further delay , the matter will be placed in the hands of legal counsel . " In the second drawer I found an old wooden gun case and opened it . Fitted into its shaped felt lining were a pair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oiled and gleaming like strange blue jewels . I lifted one of the pistols out of the case and hefted it in my hand . It was so light and so well balanced that it seemed to come up of its own accord to eye level and let me sight along it . I aimed it at the picture of the man with the whiskers , but that only made me feel foolish . I carried it to the window to find something better to aim at . No birds . But there was a circular bird feeder on a metal pole set in cement . A rat was eating the few kernels of grain left in the feeder . I pointed the empty gun at him . He ran down the pole and disappeared in the black ravine . 147  | " What in the world are you doing ? " Jean said behind me . " Playing games . " " Put it away , please . Elizabeth would n't like you to be handling her pistols . " I returned the gun to its case . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think so . I hate all guns . " She fell silent , but her eyes were full of further things to say . The girl had changed her short bright dress for a black one that covered her knees but did n't fit her . She reminded me of an actress again , this time a young woman playing the part of an older one . " Do I look all right ? " She sounded anxious , as if in the absence of her son , the death of her husband , she doubted who she was . " You could n't look any other way . " She pushed the compliment away as if it might contaminate her and backed onto the couch , pulling her legs up under her black skirt so that they were completely hidden . I closed the gun case and put it away . " Were those her father 's guns ? " " Yes . They belonged to Elizabeth 's father . " " Does she use them ? " " If you mean does she shoot birds now , the answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the great man . Everything in this house is some kind of a relic . I feel like one myself . " " Is that Elizabeth 's dress ? " " Yes it is . " " Are you thinking of living in this house ? " " I may . It suits my mood . " She bowed her head and sat in a listening attitude as if the black dress was wired for sound like a space suit . " Elizabeth used to shoot a lot of birds . She taught Stanley to do it . It must have worried him , or he would n't have told me about it . Apparently it worried his mother , too . She gave up shooting entirely long before I knew her . " But my father never did , " she said surprisingly , " at least not as long as my mother stayed with him . My father loved to shoot at anything that moved . And mother and I had to pluck the quail he shot , and the pigeons . After my mother left my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had jumped from Stanley 's family to her own without any transition . Wondering why , I said : " Are you thinking of going back to your family now ? " " I have no family . Mother 's remarried and living in New Jersey . The last I heard of my father he was running a sportfishing boat in the Bahamas . Anyway , I could n't face either of them . They 'd blame me for everything that 's happened . " " Why ? " " They just would , that 's all . Because I went away and put myself through school . Neither of them approved of my doing that . A girl is supposed to do what she 's told . " Her voice was stony with resentment . " Who do you blame for everything that 's happened ? " " Myself , of course . But I blame Stanley , too . " She lowered her eyes again . " I know that 's a dreadful thing to say . I can  | forgive him for the girl . And all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he have to takebring Ronny with him ? " " He wanted money from his mother , and Ronny 's visit was part of the transaction . " " How do you know that ? " " Elizabeth said so . " " She would . She 's a cold woman . " She added as if in apology to the house : " I should n't say that . She 's suffered a lot . And Stanley and I have n't been much comfort to her . We 've taken a great deal , and have n't given much . " " What have you taken ? " " Money . " She sounded angry at herself . " Does Elizabeth have much money ? " " Of courseshe 's wealthy . She must have made a fortune out of the Canyon Estates development , and she still has hundreds of acres left . " " They 're not producing much , except for a few acres of avocados . And she seems to have a lot of unpaid bills . " " That 's just because she 's rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to run a small sports shop in Reno , and the ones who could best afford to pay were the very ones he had to threaten to take to court . Elizabeth has thousands a year from her grandfather 's estate . " " How many thousands a year ? " " I do n't really know . She 's close-mouthed about her money . But she has it . " " Who gets it if she dies ? " " Do n't say that ! " Jean sounded scared and superstitious . She added in a more controlled voice : " Dr. Jerome says she 's going to be okay . Her attack was just the result of overexertion and strain . " " Can she talk all right ? "  | " Of course . But I would n't bother her today if I were you . " " I 'll take it up with Dr. Jerome , " I said . " But you have n't answered my other question . Who gets her money when she dies ? " " Ronny does . " Her voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could n't hold . " Are you worried about who will pay you ? Is that why you 're hanging around here when you should be out looking for him ? " I did n't try to answer her , but sat and maintained a low profile for a while . Anger and grief were alternating in her like an electric current . She turned the anger against herself , taking the hem of her skirt between her hands and pulling at it as if she was trying to tear it . " Do n't do that , Jean . " " Why should n't I ? I hate this dress . " " Then take it off and put on another one . You must n't go to pieces . " " I ca n't stand waiting . " " It may stretch out for a while , and you 've got to stand it . " " Is n't there anything more we can do ? Ca n't you go out and find him ? " " Not directly . There 's too much ground to cover . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down that I added : " But I do have one or two leads . " I got out the advertisement again , with its picture of Stanley 's father and Kilpatrick 's wife . " Have you seen this ? " She bent her head over the clipping . " I did n't see it until some time after it came out . Stanley placed it in the Chronicle without telling me , when we were in San Francisco last June . He did n't tell his mother , either , and when she saw it she was furious . " " Why ? " 151  | " She said he was bringing the whole scandal back to life . But I do n't suppose anyone cared , really , except for her and Stanley . " And Jerry Kilpatrick , I thought , and Jerry 's father , and possibly the woman herself . " Do you know who this woman is ? " " Her name was Kilpatrick , according to Elizabeth . She was married to a local real estate man , Brian Kilpatrick . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Very good terms , I think . They 're partners , or co-investors , in Canyon Estates . " " What about Kilpatrick 's son Jerry ? " " I do n't think I know him . What does he look like ? " " He 's a lanky boy about nineteen , with long reddish brown hair and a beard . Very emotional . He hit me over the head with a gun last night . " " Is he the one who took Ronny away on the yacht ? " " He 's the one . " " I may know him after all . " Her sight turned inward and stayed that way for a while , as if she was doing a sum in mental arithmetic . " He did n't have a beard then , but I think he came to our house one night last June . I only saw him for a moment . Stanley took him into the study and shut the door . But I believe he had that clipping with him . " Her head came up . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us ? Because his mother eloped with Stanley 's father ? " " It 's possible . I think the boy really cares about his mother . In fact , he may be on his way to her now . " " Then we 've got to find her , " Jean said . " I agree with you . If I can believe my informant , the ex-Mrs . Kilpatrick is living somewhere south of San Francisco , on the Peninsula . " She seized on the lead because it was the only one . " Will you go there for me ? Today ? " 152  | The life was coming back into her face . I hated to disappoint her . " I 'd better stay here until we get something definite . Jerry sailed in the Ensenada race last summer , and he may have gone that way . " " To Mexico ? " " A lot of young people are ending up there . But our lead on the Peninsula ought to be checked out . " She stood up . " I 'll go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Here in this house ? " " Here in town , anyway . I doubt that this is a kidnaping for ransom . But if it is , you 're the one they 'll be getting in touch with . " She looked at the phone as if it had just spoken . " I have no money . " " You 've just been telling me about Mrs. Broadhurst 's money . You can raise some if you have to . As a matter of fact , I 'm glad you brought the subject up . " " Because I have n't paid you ? " " I 'm not anxious . But we 're going to need some actual cash pretty soon . " Jean was getting disturbed again . She moved around the little room , awkward and angry in her ill-fitting black dress . " I 'm not going to ask Elizabeth for money . Of course , I could go and look for a job . " " At the moment , that is n't very realistic . " She paused in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried the possibility that we could be passionate enemies or friends . There was angry heat stored up in her like deep hot springs beyond the reach of her marriage or her widowhood . She said in a more confident voice , as if she had somehow taken my measure : " Speaking of realism , what are you going to do to get my son back ? " 153  | " I have a call in to a man named Willie Mackey who runs a detective agency in San Francisco . He knows the Bay area thoroughly and I 'd like to co-opt him . " " Do that . I can raise the money . " She seemed to have made a decision involving more than money . " What are you going to do ? " " Waitand ask questions . " She made an impatient movement and sat on the couch again . " All you do is ask questions . " " I get tired of it , too . Sometimes people tell me things without being asked , but you 're not one of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's just another question , is n't it ? " " Not exactly . I was thinking you 've had a strange marriage . " " And you want me to tell you about it , " she stated . " If you want to , I 'm willing to listen . " " Why should I ? " " You got me into this . " The reminder touched off her anger againit was very near the surface . " I 've always known about voyeurs . But you 're an auditeur , are n't you ? " " What are you so ashamed of ? " " I 'm not ashamed , " she said hotly . " Leave me alone . I do n't want to talk about it . " I sat without speaking for a couple of minutes . I suspected I was half in love with her , partly because she was Ronny 's mother but also because she was beautiful and young . The body sheathed in her tight black dress seemed infinitely poignant . But her widowhood seemed to project around her a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as I reminded myself , I was nearly twice her age . 154  | She was looking at me with candid eyes , as if she had heard my thoughts . " I hate to admit it , " she said , " I never have admitted it until now . My marriage was a failure . Stanley lived in a world of his own , and I could n't reach him . Maybe if he was alive , he would say the same thing about me . But we never actually discussed it . We just went our separate ways in the same house . I looked after Ronny , and Stanley got more and more wrapped up in searching for his father . I used to look in on him late at night sometimes , when he was working in his study . Sometimes he 'd be just sitting there shuffling through his pictures and his letters . He looked like a man counting his money , " she said with her quick disorganized smile . " But I should n't be making light of him , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing much more seriously . The Reverend Riceyman advised me to . He said that Stanley was looking for his own lost self , and I 'm beginning to realize he was right . " " I 'd like to talk to Riceyman . " " So would I. Unfortunately he 's dead . " " What did he die of ? " " Old age . I really miss him . He was a nice man , with a lot of understanding . But I did n't listen to him . I was angry , and jealous . " " Jealous ? " " Of Stanley and his parents , and their wrecked marriage . I felt as if it was competing with my own marriage , gradually edging it out of the picture . Stanley was living more and more in the past , and getting more and more impatient with me . Maybe if I had tried harder , I could have stopped him . Then all at once it was too late . That ad he placed in the Chronicle touched off this whole disaster , did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to answer her . The phone rang . It was Willie Mackey . " Hello , Lew . Mission accomplished . Now what can I do for you ? " " I 'm looking for a woman , aged forty or so . When she left Santa Teresa fifteen years ago her name was Ellen Strome Kilpatrick . She was traveling with a man named Leo Broadhurst . He may or may not be living with her now . According to my slightly freaked-out informant , she 's staying on the Peninsula now , in an old house two or three stories high , with a pair of towers . And trees around it , oaks and some pines . " " Ca n't you pinpoint it any better ? There are still a lot of trees on the Peninsula . " " There was a Great Dane in the neighborhood a week ago today . He acted lost . " " What 's Ellen 's background ? " " She 's the divorced wife of a real estate man here in Santa Teresa . Brian Kilpatrick . He told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clicking sound of satisfaction . " That means we start in Palo Alto . The Stanford grads go back there like horning pigeons . Do you have a picture of Ellen Strome Kilpatrick ? " " I have one from an ad in the Chronicle that came out late in June . It shows her and Leo Broadhurst as of fifteen years ago when they arrived in San Francisco , using the name Mr. and Mrs. Ralph Smith . " " I have the ad in my clipping file , " Willie said . " As I recall , it offers a thousand-dollar reward . " " You have a good memory for money . " " Yes , I do . I just got married again . Am I in line for the reward ? " " Unfortunately the man who offered it is dead . " I told him how Stanley had died , and the rest of it . 156  | " What makes Ellen so important ? " " I intend to ask her . Do n't you ask her , though . When you find her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I said goodbye to him and then to Jean . Her mood had changed , and she did n't want me to go and leave her alone . Before I closed the front door of the house I could hear her angry crying . Along Mrs. Snow 's street the jacaranda blossoms hung like purple clouds caught and condensing on the branches of the trees . I sat in my car for a minute and rested my eyes on them . Brown-skinned children were playing in the yard next door . The curtain over Mrs. Snow 's front window twitched like an eyelid with a tic . Then she came out and approached my car . She was wearing rusty silk that resembled armor and her face was blanched with powder , as if she was expecting an important visitor . Not me . She said in controlled fury : " You have no right to do this . You 're persecuting us . " I climbed out and stood with my hat in my hand . " That 's not my intention , Mrs. Snow . Your son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have to talk without a lawyer . I know that 157  | muchhe 's been in trouble before . But this time he 's as innocent as a little newborn babe . " " That innocent ? " She stood unsmiling , blocking the way to her house . The elders of the family next door , sensing the possibility of trouble , quietly came outside . They drifted in our direction like a forming audience . Mrs. Snow gave them a long look , in which anger congealed into something very like fear . She turned to me : " If you insist on talking , come inside . " She took me into her little front room . The tea that Mrs. Broadhurst had spilled stained the rug like the old brown evidence of a crime . Mrs. Snow stayed on her feet , and kept me standing . " Where 's Fritz ? " " My son is in his room . " " Ca n't he come out ? " " No , he ca n't . The doctor is coming to see him . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way you did yesterday . " " He was upset before I talked to him . " " I know that . But you made it worse . Frederick is weak in his feelings . He has been since he had his nervous breakdown . And I 'm not going to let you send him back to the nursing home if I can help it . " I felt a twinge of shame , simply because she was small and female and indomitable . But she was standing in my way , and the lost boy was somewhere on the other side of her . " Do you know Al Sweetner , Mrs. Snow ? " She compressed her lips , and shook her head . " I never heard of him . " But the eyes behind her spectacles were watchful . " Did n't Al come by your house last week ? " 158  | " He may have . I 'm not home all the time . What was that name again ? " " Al Sweetner . He was killed last night . The Los Angeles police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark eyes brightened like a nocturnal animal 's caught by a flashlight . " I see . " " Did you give him money , Mrs. Snow ? " " Not much . I gave him a five-dollar bill . I did n't know that he escaped from prison . " " Why did you give him money ? " " I felt sorry for him , " she said . " Was he a friend of yours ? " " I would n't say that . But he needed gas to get out of town , and I could spare him five dollars . " " I heard you gave him twenty . " She looked at me without wavering . " What if I did ? I had no change . And I did n't want him hanging around until Frederick got home from work . " " Was he a friend of Frederick 's ? " " I would n't call him a friend . Al was a friend to no one , including himself . " " But you knew him . " She sat down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I sat on a chair nearby . Her face was closed and intent . She looked like a woman who had taken a deep breath and submerged herself . " I 'm not denying I knew him . He lived with us here in this house for a while when he was a boy . He was already in trouble , and the county was looking for a foster home . It was either that or the Preston Reformatory . Mr. Snow was still living then , and we agreed to take Albert into our home . " " That was generous of you . " She shook her head abruptly . " I do n't claim that . We 159  | needed the money . We wanted to keep our home together , for Frederick , and Mr. Snow was ailing , and prices were sky-high in those days , too . Anyway , we took Albert in and did our best for him . But he was a hard case alreadythere was n't much we could do to straighten him out . And he was a bad influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minds what to do when he solved the question for us . He stole a car and ran away with a girl . " " And Frederick was involved , was n't he ? " She drew in a long breath like a diver coming up for air . " You 've heard about it , have you ? " " Just a little . " " Then you probably heard it all wrong . A lot of people blamed Frederick for the whole thing , because he was the oldest . But Albert Sweetner was old beyond his years , and so was the girl . She was only fifteen or so but you can take my word for it , she was experienced . Frederick was easily led , like putty in their hands . " " Did you know the girl ? " " I knew her . " " What was her name ? " " Marty Nickerson . Her father was a construction man when he worked . They lived in a motel at the end of this street . The way I got to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. and Mrs. Broadhurst had a party . I was keeping house for the Broadhursts at the time . Marty was a pretty little thing , but hard as nails . She was the real ringleader , if you want my opinion . And she was the one who got off scot-free , of course . " " Exactly what happened ? " " They stole a car , as I said . It must have been Marty 's idea because they stole it from a man she knewhe owned the motel where she lived . Then the three of them ran off to 16o  | Los Angeles . That was her idea , tooshe wanted to be a movie actress and she was crazy to go and live in Los Angeles . They lasted three days and nights down there , sleeping in the car and scrounging for food . Then the three of them got caught trying to lift some goods from a day-old bakery shop . " She was talking with a kind of unconscious gusto , as if the adventure had been hers as well as her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repressed it , forcing iron disapproval on her face . " The worst of it was , Marty Nickerson turned up pregnant . She was underage , and Frederick admitted he had carnal knowledge of her and the judge and probation people gave him a hard choice . He could stand trial as an adult and take his chances on going to the pen . Or he could plead guilty in Juvenile Court and get probation with six months in forestry camp . The lawyer said we should n't try to fight itthey bear down hard if you fight them in Juvenile Court so Frederick went to forestry camp . " " What happened to the others ? " " Marty Nickerson got married . She married the man she stole the car from , and they never even took her into court . " " Where is she now ? " " I do n't really know . The man had a business in the northern part of the county , and for all I know she 's still living with him there . " " What 's her married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't remember . I can find out if it 's important . She sent Frederick a Christmas greeting the first year , which took some nerve on her part . I think he still has it in his keepsake drawer . " " What about Al ? " " Al is another story . It was n't his first offense . He was 161  | already on probation , and they sent him to Preston until he was of age . I remember when he got out . It was fifteen years ago this past summer , and the jacarandas were starting to bloom . He came here to pick up his things . I 'd kept them for him in a cartonsome schoolbooks and a blue suit that the county had bought for him to go to church in . But the blue suit did n't fit him any more , and he was n't interested in the books . I gave him a good meal and a little money . " She shook her head as if I had spoken . " It was n't generosity on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frederick got mixed up with him again . Frederick was working for the Forest Service at that time , and I did n't want Albert interfering with his job . But it happened anyway . " " What happened ? " " Albert lost him his job and gave him a nervous breakdown into the bargain . I do n't want to go into the gory details . What 's past is past , and Albert did n't set foot on my doorstep again until he showed up last week . Now you tell me he 's dead . " " He was murdered in Northridge last night . We do n't know who did it , or why . But it might help if you tell me what happened fifteen years ago . How did Albert give Fritz a nervous breakdown ? " " By getting him in trouble . It 's always the same old story . " " What was the trouble ? " " He took Frederick 's tractor and went joyriding in the hills . But of course it was n't Frederick 's , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Frederick could have been sent to federal prison along with Albert . As it was , they threw him out of his job , and it was all Albert 's fault . " I was getting restless . " May I talk to Frederick , Mrs. Snow ? " 162  | " I do n't see any point in it . I 've told you everything you asked . And I can tell you anything he can tell you . " " But there may be things that you do n't know and he does . " " I 'm afraid you do n't understand , " she said with a faintly superior look . " Frederick and I are very close . " But after a moment she said : " What sort of things do you mean ? " " I 'd prefer to talk to him about it . You 're his mother , and you 're naturally defensive . " " I have to be . Frederick does n't stand up for himself . Ever since he had his breakdown and lost his job with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You should have heard him crying in his room after you cross-questioned him yesterday . " " He did n't say anything incriminating to me . " She gave me a skeptical look . " What did he say ? " " I do n't think I should tell you . He 's a grown man . " " You 're wrong . He 's a boy in a man 's body . He 's never been the same since he had his nervous breakdown . " " Which happened fifteen years ago , is that correct ? " " That 's correct . It was the summer Captain Broadhurst went away . " " Was Frederick fond of the captain ? " " He worshiped the ground he walked on . Captain Broadhurst was like a father to him . He idolized the whole Broadhurst family . And it broke his heart when the captain ran off . It was like his own father dying on him all over again . I 'm not making that up . Dr. Jerome said it himself . " " Is he the doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He should be here any time now . " " Is he a psychiatrist ? " " We do n't believe in psychiatrists , " she said flatly . " Dr. Jerome is a good doctor . He 's Mrs. Broadhurst 's doctor , 163  | which means he has to be good . When Frederick had his breakdown she got him Dr. Jerome and paid the bills , including the nursing home . And when he got out of that place she gave him a job herself , in her own garden . " Mrs. Snow smiled dimly , sifting what cheer she could from the memory . " But now I 'm afraid he 's going to lose that job , too . " " I do n't see why he should , if he 's done nothing wrong . As a matter of fact , I do n't understand why he lost his job with the Forest Service . " " Neither do I. Albert took the key to his ' dozer without his permission . But the district ranger did n't believe my son . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three years before . Once a boy gets into trouble , he 's lost his good name for all future time . " Mrs. Snow got up and moved toward the door , as if she was expecting to let me out . Though the atmosphere of her home depressed me , I was n't ready to leave yet . I stayed in my chair , and after a silent struggle she came back to the platform rocker and sat down again . " Is there something else ? " she said . " You may be able to help me . This has nothing directly to do with you or Frederick . But I gather you were working for Mr. and Mrs. Broadhurst when Mr. Broadhurst took off . " 164  | " Yes I was . " " Did you happen to know the woman ? " " Ellen Kilpatrick ? I certainly did . She taught art at the high school and was married to Kilpatrick the real estate man . That was before he struck it rich with Canyon Estates . He was still living from hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kilpatrick saw a chance to better herself , I guess , and she set her net for Captain Broadhurst . I saw the whole thing happen . When Mrs. Broadhurst was away , the two of them used to leave Stanley with me and go up to the Mountain House . Mrs. Kilpatrick was supposed to be teaching the captain to paint pictures . But she was teaching him other things as well . They thought they were fooling everyone , but they were n't . I used to catch the looks between them sometimes , like they were off in a secret world by themselves and nobody else existed . " " Did Mrs. Broadhurst know about the affair ? " " She must have . I could see that she was suffering . But she never said a word , at least not within my hearing . I think she wanted to avoid a break . Her family stands for something in this townat least they used to . And then there was poor little Stanley to consider . Sometimes when I think back , I think an open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run . He used to ask me what his father and the woman were doing up there in the Mountain House . And I had to make up a story for him , but he was never entirely taken in . Children never are . " " This went on for some time , I gather . " " At least a year . It was a strange year , even for me . I was keeping house for Mrs. Broadhurst , and I was in it but not of it . After a while the two of them got careless in front of me . You 'd think I was part of the furniture or something . Toward the end they did n't always bother to go to the 165  | Mountain House . One reason for that , Frederick was working on a Forest Service trail at the head of the canyon . So the two of them stayed around the house when Mrs. Broadhurst was out . They 'd lock themselves in the den and come out fiery red in the face , and I 'd have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squeaking . " Her face blushed faintly mauve under the powder . " I do n't know why I 'm telling you all this . I intended to go to my grave without telling anyone . " " Do you know what made them leave ? " " I guess the strain got to be too much for them . It was almost too much for me . I was just about ready to quit my job when they finally did take off . " " Where did they go ? " " They went to San Francisco , so I 've heard , and neither one of them ever did come back here . I do n't know what they lived on . He had no profession , and no money of his own . Knowing both of them , my guess would be that she got a job in the Bay area , and she 's probably supporting him to this day . He is n't what you call a practical man . " " What kind of a woman is she ? " " The arty type , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She pretended to have her head in the clouds , but her feet were made of clay . Sometimes I really felt sorry for her . She used to follow him with her eyes as if she was a dog and he was her master . I 've often thought about it sincehow a woman with a husband of her own and a little boy could feel like that for another woman 's husband . " " I gather from his picture that he was a good-looking man . " " That 's true . Where did you see his picture ? " I got out Stanley 's advertisement and showed it to her . She gave it a look of recognition : " This is the clipping Albert Sweetner had the other day . 166  | He wanted to make sure that the man was Captain Broadhurst . I told him it was . " " Did he ask about the woman ? " " He did n't have to . Albert knew Mrs. Kilpatrick from away back .

" " Where would he get the cash for a thousand-dollar reward ? He does n't have one nickel to rub against another . " " From his mother . At least that was the idea . " " I see . " Her eyes came up from the clipping , full of the past . " Poor little Stanley . He was still trying to find out what went on in the Mountain House . " The woman 's insight continued to surprise me . Her mind had been sharpened by trouble , and exercised by years of defensive tactics on behalf of Fritz . I realized she 'd been talking to me for a purpose , fending me off with stories like an aging Scheherazade , laying down a barrage of words between me and her son . I looked at my watch . It was a quarter to one . " Do you have to go ? " Mrs. Snow said eagerly . " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You ca n't . I wo n't permit it . He 's always blaming himself for things he did n't do . " " I can make allowances for that . " She shook her head . " It 's unfair of you to ask . I 've told you a lot more than Frederick ever could . " She added with a kind of angry bravado : " If there 's anything more you want to know , ask me . " " There is one thing . You mentioned a Christmas card that Marty Nickerson sent Frederick . " " It was n't a Christmas card , exactlyjust a greeting on a 167 The Underground Man postcard . " She got up . " I think I can find it if you want to see it . " She went through the doorway into the kitchen . I heard a second door open and close , and then a mumble of talk through the thin walls . I could hear Frederick 's voice rising hysterically , his mother 's voice quieting him down . She came out with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the face of the card showed the front of a two-story motel whose sign said : " Yucca Tree Motor Inn . " It had been postmarked in Petroleum City on December 22 , 1952 . The message was handwritten in faded green ink : Dear Fritz , Long time no see . How are things in good old Santa Teresa ? I have a little girl , born December 15 , just in time to be my Christmas baby . She weighs seven lbs. , six oz. , and she 's a dolly . We decided to call her Susan . I am very happy . Hoping you are the same . Christmas greetings to you and your mother . Martha ( Nickerson ) Crandall The phone rang in the kitchen . Mrs. Snow jumped as if an alarm had sounded . But she pulled the kitchen door shut behind her before she answered it . A moment later she opened the door again . " It 's Mr. Kelsey , " she said , holding her mouth as if the name tasted bitter . " He wants to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to let me pass and stayed in the doorway to listen . Kelsey 's voice was urgent : " The Ariadne 's been sighted by one of the volunteer pilots in the sheriff 's aero-squadron . She 's grounded in Dunes Bay . " " What happened to the kids aboard her ? " " That is n't clear . But it does n't sound too good . According to my information she 's breaking up in the surf . " 168  | " Exactly where ? " " Just below the state park . Do you know the place ? " " Yes . Where are you ? I can pick you up . " " I 'm afraid I ca n't leave town right now . I have a lead in the Stanley Broadhurst killing . I should n't leave the fire area , anyway . " " What 's the lead ? " " Your man with the long black wig was seen in the area yesterday . He was driving an old white car along Rattlesnake Road . A coed from the college was taking a walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started . " " Is it a positive identification ? " " Not yet . I 'm going to talk to her now . " Kelsey hung up . Turning away from the phone , I noticed that the door of Fritz 's room was ajar . One of his moist eyes appeared at the crack like the eye of a fish in an underwater crevice . His mother , at the other door , was watching him like a shark . " How are you , Fritz ? " I said . " I feel just terrible . " He opened the door wider . In his rumpled pajamas he looked less like a man than an ill-kept boy . His mother said : " Go back in your room and be quiet . " He shook his frowzy head . " I do n't like it in there . I keep seeing things in there . " " What do you keep seeing , Fritz ? " I said . " I keep seeing Mr. Broadhurst in his grave . " " Did you bury him ? " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodding and crying like a human pump . His mother moved between us . Leaning her slight weight against his amorphous body , she pushed him back into his room . She closed the door on him and locked it and turned on 169  | me , holding the key like a weapon . " Please get out of here now . You 've got him all upset . " " If he buried Stanley Broadhurst yesterday , you ca n't very well hush it up . You 're crazy to try . " She let out a kind of terrier noise which was meant to be a laugh . " I 'm not the one that 's crazy . He no more buried Mr. Broadhurst than I did . You people have got him so confused and frightened that he does n't know what he did or what he saw . Except that I know for a fact he did n't do anything wrong . I know my son . " She spoke with such assurance that I almost believed her . " I still think he knows more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal less , you mean . He does n't know what he knows . And I should think you 'd be ashamed of yourself , badgering a widow and her only son . If the doctor finds him in this condition , he 'll want to commit him to the State Hospital . " " Has he been committed before ? " " He nearly was , years ago . But Mrs. Broadhurst said she 'd pay for the nursing home . " " This was in 1955 ? " " Yes . Now will you please get out of my kitchen ? I did n't invite you in here , but I 'm inviting you out . " I thanked her , and left the house . At the curb in front of it , a middle-aged man in sports clothes was climbing out of a yellow sports car . He lifted a medical bag out of the boot and came toward me . His gray hair and light blue eyes were in contrast to his high color . " Dr. Jerome ? " " Yes . " His look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I was doing . " Mrs. Stanley Broadhurst hired me . How is Elizabeth Broadhurst , by the way ? " 170  | " She 's suffering from exhaustion , which brought on a mild heart attack . " " Is she talkable ? " " Not today . Possibly tomorrow . But I 'd stay off the subject of her sonand her grandson . " The doctor took a deep breath and sighed with unexpected feeling . " I just had a look at Stanley 's body in the morgue . I hate to see a young man die . " " Was it the stab wound that killed him ? " " I would say so . " " Were you his doctor ? " " I was for most of his lifeas long as he lived at home . And I still saw him from time to time . He liked to check in with me when he had a problem . " " What sort of problems did he have ? " " Emotional problems . Marital problems . I really ca n't discuss them with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stanley . He 's dead . " " I 'm aware of that , " the doctor said with some asperity . " The problem I 'm interested in is who stabbed him to death and buried him . " " Your patient Fritz Snow says he buried him . " I watched the doctor for his reaction . His bland eyes did n't shift . His high hard color remained unchanged . He even smiled a little . " Do n't believe him . Fritz is always confessing something . " " How do you know it is n't true ? " " Because he 's been my patient for over twenty years . " " Is he insane ? " " I would n't put it that way . He 's hypersensitive , and he tends to blame himself for everything . When he gets emotionally upset , he loses all sense of reality . Poor Fritz has been a frightened boy all his life . " 171  | " What 's he frightened of ? " " His mother , among other things . " " So am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor said with a glint of amusement . " She 's a powerful little woman . But she probably got that way because she had to . Her late husband was very much like Fritz . He had a hard time holding any job . I suppose their basic trouble was genetic , and there 's still not much we can do about heredity . " We both glanced toward the house . Mrs. Snow was monitoring us from the front window . She let the curtain fall back into place . " I really have to get in to see my patient , " Jerome said . " Perhaps we can have a talk about him some time when you 're free . Whether or not Fritz is innocent , as you say , he has been connected with the main suspect in Stanley 's death . " I told him about Al Sweetner , - and Kelsey 's new lead . " And we know Fritz had access to the tools that were used to dig Stanley 's grave . On top of that , he told me that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly from side to side . " If the sky fell , Fritz would find a way to blame himself . As a matter of fact , there 's a pretty good possibility that Stanley dug his own grave . " " The deputy coroner and I were speculating about that possibility . " " This is n't entirely speculation on my part , " Jerome said . " When I examined Stanley 's body just now , I noticed blisters on his hands . " " What kind of blisters ? " " Ordinary water blisters , on the insides of both hands . " He touched the palm of his left hand with the wide spatulate 172  | fingers of his right . " The kind of blisters a man gets from digging he is n't used to . I admit it 's hard to understand why a man would dig his own grave . " " He may have been forced to do it . " I said . " Al Sweetner , the man in the wig , was a hard case when he was alive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Or Stanley may have had some other compelling reason . " " What reason ? " " I do n't know . He may have intended to bury somebody else . He had a young girl with him , as well as his son . " " What happened to them ? " " I 'm on my way to find out . " Dunes Bay was at the end of a winding county road off Highway 1 . Above the wind-carved hills of sand which rose northward along the shore , clouds were streaming inland like torn pennants . It looked as if a storm was on the way . The kiosk at the entrance to the state park was closed and empty . I drove on through to the parking lot which overlooked the ocean . About three hundred feet out , where the waves were breaking , the white sloop lay on her side . Further out a flock of pelicans circled and dived for fish . Three people were watching Ariadne from the beach . They were n't the three that I was looking for . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uniform . Near him but not with him , a couple of boys with long sun-faded hair leaned on their surfboards . I got my binoculars out of the trunk of my car and focused them on the sloop . She was dismasted , and her rigging hung overside like a torn net . Her hull appeared to be sprung and heavy with water . She rose up sluggishly when the long surge lifted her , then fell back clumsily on her side . My breathing labored as if in empathy . I went down to the beach on a wooden walkway half drifted over with sand . The state park man turned to meet me , and I asked him if the young people had been rescued . " Yessir . They got ashore . " " All three of them ? " " Yessir . These boys here were a great help . " Following his gesture , I looked at the two surfers . They returned my look with a kind of wary pride , as if they distrusted any possible adult approval . " They 're okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads in solemn unison . " Where are they now ? " He shrugged his limber shoulders . " Somebody came and picked them up in a station wagon . " " What kind of a station wagon ? " He pointed toward the park official . " Ask him . " I turned to the man , who looked like somebody 's son-inlaw . He answered me uncomfortably : " It was a blue Chevy wagon , recent model . I did n't get the license number . I had no reason to . I did n't know at the time that they were fugitives . " " The little boy is n't a fugitive . He may be a kidnaping victim . " " He did n't act like one . " 174  | " How did he act ? " " Scared . But not scared of them particularly . He went along with them without any trouble . " " Where did they take him ? " " To the station wagon . " " I know that . Who was driving it ? " " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did she know they were here ? " " I let the blond girl use my phone . I had no way of knowing that they " " Can you trace the call ? " " I do n't see how , unless it was long-distance . I 'll give it a try , though . " He plodded toward the walkway , shielding his face against the blowing sand . I followed him up the entrance kiosk and waited while he used the phone inside it . He came out shaking his head , with his hands spread loosely . " They do n't seem to have any record of the call . " " Have you talked to the police ? " " They came and went . The sheriff 's captain came out from Petroleum City . But that was after the three of them took off in the Chevy wagon .

" 175  | a country town which had grown up suddenly . It had spilled beyond its limits into miles of quick housing developments congealing in a glacier of sameness . The Yucca Tree Inn had grown since its postcard picture was taken fifteen years ago . It was built around three sides of a short block at the southern edge of the city , with a convention center on the fourth side . The movable lettering on the marquee in front offered " Steak , Lobster and Continuous Entertainment .

" She gave me an unsmiling look . " You are n't the one that lent Susie the blanket . " " I did n't say I was . Is Susie here ? " " No . They took off again . " She paused with her lips parted , as if she 'd been overtaken by sudden doubt . " I 'm not supposed to be talking about it , though . " " Who said so ? " " Mr. Crandall . " " Lester Crandall ?

That 's easier said than done , though . The minute my back was turned , the three of them piled into the station wagon and took off again . " " Which way ? " " San Francisco . " She moved her thumb like a hitchhiker in that direction . I got the license number of the station wagon from her . " Did you tell the police ? " " Why should I ? It 's her father 's car . Anyway , Mr. Crandall told me to keep the police out of it . " " When do you expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She looked as if she was n't looking forward to the meeting .

" She said with the air of repeating an old joke : " I 'm thinking seriously of changing it to Sorrow . " " Do n't do that . Can I buy you a drink ? " " Sorry , I ca n't leave the desk . But thanks for the offer . " She gave me a smile which gradually faded . " What goes on with Susie , anyway ? She used to be a nice quiet young girl , almost too quiet . " " She is n't any more .

I thought they were stayingin fact the boy with the beard asked me about getting a doctor for his arm . He had what looked like a broken armhanging loose , you know ? But then he changed his mind and said he 'd wait until he saw his mother . I asked him where his mother was , but I did n't get an answer out of him . " " What about the little boy ?

" She was silent and then said as if at random : " Did you see the pelicans at Dunes Bay ? They ca n't have any more young ones , did you know that ? Their bodies are poisoned with DDT , and it makes their eggs all break . " I told her that I knew about the pelicans . " What about Susan ? Did she do any talking ? " " Very little .

But I hate to see Susie kick over the traces like this . She used to be a real good girlI mean it . Headstrong like her father , but good at heart . " She went into deep thought for a minute . Her face , forgetful of me , dreamed downward as if she had a child at her breast . I prompted her : " What changed her ? " " She seems kind of desperate to me . I do n't know why . " She grimaced .

" I winced at the word , but I found something hopeful to say . " She turned to you . " " But then she turned around and went away again . " " You care about Susan . " " Yes I do . I never had a daughter . " 18o  | I had n't eaten for seven or eight hours . I went into the restaurant-bar from which the music emanated and hung my hat on the brass-studded tip of a mounted longhorn . While my steak was being grilled , I shut myself up in a phone booth and put in another call to Willie Mackey . Willie answered the phone himself . " Mackey Services . " " This is Archer . Have you put your finger on Ellen ? " " Not yet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog ? " " The Great Dane , " Willie said impatiently . " He was lost all right . I 've been in touch with the owner , who lives outside Mill Valley . He advertised for his dog last week , and somebody found it in Sausalito . That 's a long way from the Peninsula , Lew . " " My informant was an acid freak , I think . " " I was wondering , " Willie said . " Anyway , I have a man over in Sausalito now . You know Harold . " " Can you contact him ? " " I should be able to . He has one of the radio cars . " " Tell him to watch for a blue Chevy station wagon with three young people in it . " I gave him their names and descriptions , and the license number of the car . " What is Harold supposed to do if he sees them ? " 181  | " Stay with them . Get the little boy , if he can do it without endangering him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself , " Willie said . " You did n't tell me this was a snatch . " " It is n't an ordinary one . " " Then what are these people up to ? " I had no ready answer . After a moment I said : " The little boy 's father was murdered yesterday . He was probably a witness to the killing . " " The other two did it ? " " I do n't know . " I felt a growing ambivalence about Susan and JerryI wanted to end their wild flight , not only for the child 's sake but for their own . " We have to go on that assumption , though . " I went back into the restaurant . My steak was ready , and I washed it down with draft beer . Behind the semi-elliptical bar four cowboys who had never been near a cow sang western songs which sounded as if they had originated in the far east . I ordered a second beer and looked around the place . It was a noisy mixture of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cowboys both dude and actual , offduty servicemen with their wives and girls , tourists , oilworkers wearing high-heeled boots like the cowboys , a few men in business suits with wide ties and narrow sun-crinkled eyes . Some of the eyes seemed to brighten like electronic sensors when Lester Crandall came in from the lobby . Electronic money sensors . He paused in the doorway , looking around the room . I raised my hand . He came over and shook it . " You 're Archer , are n't you ? How did you get here so fast ? " I told him , watching his face as I talked . His reactions 182  | seemed dull and sluggish , as if he had n't slept the night before . Still he seemed more at home in his motor inn than in his big house in the Palisades . The waitresses had sprung to attention when he entered , and one of them came to the table : " Can I get you anything , Mr. Crandall ? " " Bourbon . You know my brand . And hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary , " I said . " But thanks . " " My pleasure . " He bent forward , regarding me through puffed eyelids . " If you 've told me and I 've forgotten , please excuse me . I 'm a little slow today . It still is n't clear to me what your interest is . " " I 'm working for Mrs. Stanley Broadhurst . I 'm trying to get her boy back before he 's hurtand before she goes off the deep end . " " I 'm pretty close to the deep end myself . " He took hold of my wrist with his work-scarred hand in a sudden gesture of intimacy . Just as suddenly , he let go . " But let me set your mind at rest about one thing . My Susan is n't the kind of girl who would hurt a little boy . " " Perhaps not intentionally . But she 's exposing him to danger . It 's a wonder he was n't drowned today . " " That 's what Mrs. Rawlins said . I wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She said she would . " " It was n't her fault she could n't . Did n't you tell her not to call in the police ? " Crandall gave me a look of unguarded cold anger . " I know the police in this part of the world . I was born and brought up here . They shoot first and ask questions afterwards . I 'm not turning them loose on my young daughter . " I could n't help agreeing with him . " We wo n't argue . Anyway , they 're well on their way to the Bay area by now . " 183  | " Where in the Bay area ? " " Probably Sausalito . " He clenched his fists and shook them as if he had dice in both hands . " Why are n't you after them ? " " I thought you might say something useful . " His eyes were still stained with anger . " Is that a crack ? " " It 's the truth . Why do n't you calm down ? A friend of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

" He gave me a dreary look . The waitress came running with his drink , smiling desperately in an effort to counteract the boss 's mood . The drink was more effective than her smile . It heightened his color and made his eyes glisten with moisture . Even his sideburns seemed to take on a bristling new life of their own . " It 's not my fault , " he said . " I gave her everything a girl could want . It 's Jerry Kilpatrick 's fault . He took an innocent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You mean it was n't him ? " " I mean he was n't the only one .

She spent some time with an escaped 184  | convict named Albert Sweetner . Does the name mean anything to you ? " " No , it does n't , and neither does the rest of your story . I just plain do n't believe it . " But his face was adjusting to it like an old fighter 's who had taken a lot of punishment and expected to have to take more . " Why are you telling me this ?

But she keeps on moving away out of my reach . " He was silent for a minute . His gaze moved past me and grew distant as if he was watching his daughter slip away over a receding horizon . I had no children , but I had given up envying people who had . " Have you any idea what she 's running from ? " He shook his head . " We gave her everything . I thought she was okay . But something happenedI do n't know what . " He moved his head obtusely from side to side , groping for his daughter in a kind of blind man 's buff . It filled me with a tedious sorrow , perhaps not unlike his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Thanks for the steak . " Crandall stood up facing me , shorter , wider , older , sadder , richer . " Where are you going , Mr. Archer ? " z85  | " Sausalito . " " Take Mother and I with you . " " Mother ? " " Mrs. Crandall . " He was one of those men who seldom referred to their wives by their Christian names . " I did n't know you had her along . " " She 's freshening up in the suite . But we can be ready to leave at a moment 's notice . I 'll pay all expenses . In fact , " he added , " let 's not beat around the bushI want to buy your services . " " I already have a client .

Crandall picked up the bill , rolled it carefully , and , rising on his toes , tucked it into my outside breast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . " " This is for the waitress . " I unrolled the dollar bill and put it back on the table . Crandall started to get angry , and then decided not to let himself . He wanted me to take Mother and him along . I accompanied him into the lobby and waited while he went upstairs to his suite . Joy Rawlins was behind the desk , taking things out of a drawer and putting them into a leatherette 186  | case . She was heavy-eyed and sallow as if she had suffered a loss of blood . " He fired me , " she said in a flat voice . " He gave me fifteen minutes to get out . And I 've been here more than fifteen years . I built this place up for him . " " I 'm sure he 'll reconsider . " " You do n't know Les .

They were the ones that brought her up . I could tell you things about Susie 's mother " Her face froze in a look of surprise , as if she had heard herself . She stopped talking .

" " Let 's see , I was pretty new on the job . And Susan was just about three . It must have been fifteen years , at least . " She grimaced . " I should have stood at home this week . Whenever that man passes through , he stirs up trouble . " " What did he stir up fifteen years ago ? " " I do n't know exactly . He wanted to talk to LesI figured he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left , all hell broke loose around here . Les and his wife had a knock-down dragout fight . " " What was the fight about ? " " I do n't knowall I heard was the shouting . You 'll have 188  | to take it up with them yourself . Only do n't quote me . I 've got to ask the son-of-a-gun for references . " Crandall called me from the top of the stairs . I went up , lifted by a certain excitement . I was eager for a second look at Martha Crandall , against the background I had been filling in . The suite was furnished in cheap luxury . She was sitting in an overstuffed chair with her legs crossed in front of her and thick new makeup on her face . I was struck again by the beauty and grace of her body . No matter how she placed herself , it seemed to organize the room around her , as a light or a fire does . But her eyes were strained and cold . They looked at me through her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night and I had been responsible for it . She gave me her hand and held on as she said : " You 've got to get Susie back for me . She 's been gone for three days now and I ca n't stand it . " " I 'm doing my best . " " Lester says she 's on her way to Sausalito . Is that right ? " " It 's a fairly good possibility . Anyway , I 'm acting on it . You may be able to help me . " " How ? " She leaned toward me in an eager posture , but her eyes did n't change . They seemed jaded , as if she was watching her life repeat itself . " I 'll do anything I can , I mean it . " Her voice was rougher , taking on the accent of her surroundings . " Do you know Ellen Kilpatrick ? " Her glance caromed off her husband , and came back to me . " It 's strange you should ask nee that . I was thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She lives in Sausalito . " 189  | " Under what name ? " " Ellen Storm . She 's an artist , she uses that name . " " She calls herself an artist , " Crandall said . " But she 's a phony . She ca n't even draw . " His voice was choked , and his face reddened . I wondered if he had reason to be angry with Ellen , or if he had simply attached his general anger to her . " Have you seen her work ? " I said . " I 've seen a sample of it . She wrote us a letter in the summer offering to sell us a painting . So I sent her some money , and she sent back this painting . " " Do you have it here ? " " I chucked it out . It was just a piece of junkan excuse to ask me for money . " " It was not , " his wife said . " She said she wanted to give us first chance . " " Nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Have you seen Ellen recently ? " She glanced nervously at her husband . " She was my homeroom teacher . Is n't that right , Les ? " He did n't answer her . He seemed to be absorbed in his own glum thoughts . " And she 's Jerry Kilpatrick 's mother , " I said . " Did you know that ? " " No . " She looked at her husband again and added after an embarrassed pause : " Not until I figured it out , I mean . " Crandall moved between his wife and me , standing over her like a prosecutor . " Did you invite Jerry Kilpatrick to the house ? " " What if I did ? It was a nice thing to do . " " It was a lousy thing to do . You can see what 's come of it . Who put you up to it ? Did she ? " " It 's none of your business . And do n't loom over me like that . " 190  | Intent on their intramural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to break it up and partly because the question needed asking , I said to her : " Was Albert Sweetner in your home room in high school ? " She sat very still and quiet for a time . Her husband was quiet , too , his eyes rather absent-looking as if he had been sandbagged by the past . " It was a big class , " she said . " What was that name again ? " " Albert Sweetner . " She uncrossed and recrossed her legs like soft and elegant scissors and looked up at her husband . " Do n't stare at me like that . How can I think with you staring at me ? " " I 'm not staring . " He tried to remove his gaze from her , and could n't . " Why do n't you go and have a drink ? " she said . " I forget how to talk with you standing there staring . " He put out his hand . Without quite touching her , it traced the contour of her head . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stick togetheryou and me against the world . " " Sure . Only give me a chance to think for a minute , will you ? Go have a drink . " He left the room slowly . I waited until I heard the click of the latch behind him , and his reluctant footsteps going downstairs . " What are you trying to do ? " the woman said . " Break up my marriage ? " " It seems to be slightly bent already . " " That is n't true . I 've been a good wife to Lester , and he knows it . I 've done my best to make up for any harm I did him in the past . " " Such as stealing his car ? " " That was nearly twenty years ago . You 've got your nerve raking it up , and throwing Albert Sweetner in my face . " 191  | " I brought him up last night . Remember ? You said you did n't know him . " " All you gave me was his first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high school . " " Are you sure , Mrs. Crandall ? He came here to your motor inn fifteen years ago . " " A lot of people come to this place . " " And just this week he took your daughter to another motel . " She pushed the idea back with her hands . " Susan would n't go with a man like that . " " I 'm afraid she did . " She stood up in agitation . " What was he trying to do ? Get back at me for turning him in ? " " You turned him in ? " " I had to . It was that or go to Juvenile Hall . But that was before Susie was even born . " " Al would n't forget it , though . " " No . He would n't forget it . He came here fifteen years ago like you said , to try and break up my marriage . That was right after he got out of Preston . " " How did he try to break up your marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lies about me . I do n't want to go into what he said . In fact , I do n't know why I 'm talking to you at all . " " Al Sweetner was murdered last night . " She looked at me in silence . Her eyes were frightened . Her body kept its feline confidence . " I see . You think I killed him . " I neither affirmed nor denied this . Her look grew chillier : " Susan ? You think it was Susan ? " " She is n't a suspect . I do n't have a logical suspect . " " Then why did you throw it at me like that ? " 192  | " It 's something I thought you ought to know . " " Thanks very much , " she said bitterly . " What was Al doing with my daughter , anyway ? " " Mainly , I think , he was trying to use her as a source of information . Al was on the run , and he came south looking for money . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Came south from where ? " " Sacramento . I think he stopped in Sausalito on the way . " She stood in a listening attitude , like a woman hearing footsteps in a graveyard . " Did Ellen point him in our direc-tion ? " " I do n't know what she did . But I 'm reasonably certain he went to see her before he came south . He was after a reward which Stanley Broadhurst offered for her and his father . " " What kind of a reward ? " " A thousand dollars cash . Al probably hoped to get more . " I produced my clipping of the ad , which was gradually wearing out . " This is Ellen , is n't it ? " " Yes . That 's the way she used to look when she was teaching high school in Santa Teresa . " " Have you seen her since those days ? " She was slow in answering the question . " I went to see her last month after we bought that picture from her . Please do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We were in San Francisco for the weekend , and I got away from him and drove across the bridge to Sausalito . " She added after a moment 's hesitation : " I took Susie with me . " " Why ? " " I do n't knowit seemed like a good idea . Ellen seemed to want to get in touch with me , and she did a lot for me when I was a young girl . If it was n't for her I would n't even have lived all the way through my teens . And Susan was 193
