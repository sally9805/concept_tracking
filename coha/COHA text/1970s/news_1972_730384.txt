txt Apparently because a smaller grain harvest is expected this year , Russians are being urged not to waste bread . Recalling the years of World War II , the Soviet press notes that a new generation has grown up that does not remember the bread ration cards of that time or the sleepless nights which Russians spent standing in line for bread . Today , it says , there is an abundance of cheap bread , and many people now have a careless attitude toward it . " Who of us , " says the current issue of the weekly Nedelya , " has not bitterly looked at the pieces of bread left on a dinner table , the hunks of bread thrown out with the garbage , the bread tossed on the ground ? a sight that insults any working man ? mildewed bread , and stony-hard dried bread ? " And what can be more immoral than turning bread into stone ? " Significantly , concern also has been voiced in the Ukraine , the traditional grain basket of the Soviet Union . The republic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brigade leader Alexander Gitalov chastising citizens who waste bread . In cafes , he laments , people clean their knives anf forks on bread and often take only one bite of a bun and throw out the rest . " I have been to many countries abroad , including America , " says Mr. Gitalov . " It is a rich country , yet they slice bread there like cheese ? in thin pieces , which they then put in cellophane bags . If half a piece is left from breakfast or lunch , it is wrapped and put into one 's pocket . " Bread is expensive there and not every one can have enough of it , " he goes on . " I do not suggest that bread should become more expensive here . We shall not live the way they do abroad . But we should learn to be thrifty . " Such injunctions suggest that the Soviet regime may be building up a campaign to conserve bread in the light of this year 's farm problems . // *Soviets warned on bread // Because of harsh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was lost , and vast areas were re-sown , mostly to feed grains ( corn , barley , and oats ) . Mr. Gitalov himself notes that thousands of hectares of winter wheat were lost in the Ukraine . It is too early to make any assessment of the harvest . The pace of harvest work so far this year has been faster because of ripening of the crop , and total sown area is larger than 1971 . But yields are expected to be down over last year . In Byelorussia , for example , 30 percent of the grain crop has been gathered so far and yields average 19.3 centners per hectare as against 21.4 centners last year . In 1971 the Russians harvested a good crop of 181 million tons of grain , the second highest on record . But Western estimates run to between 170 million and 175 million for 1972 .

Determined to fulfill its five-year plan , however , the Soviet regime has opted for a policy of buying feed grains abroad , and it will import an average of about 4 million tons of grain from the United States annually for the next three years . Meanwhile , Mr. Gitalov urges that grains . too , be economized . Because of a shortage of fodder , he writes , good-quality grain is fed to livestock as well as much bread to privately . owned pigs and poultry . The farm hero further suggests that bread be sold in sthaller than one- and two-kilogram loaves . " Our Soviet land is rich in bread and there will be enough of it this year , too , " he states .
