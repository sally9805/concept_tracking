txt There 's one overriding topic of conversation in Moscow these days ? the weather . " What heat ! " exclaims an elderly woman as she bends over to swab down the hallway of an apartment house , " One could almost expire : " " Oihhh , dushno ! " ? " It 's stifling " ? sighs another Muscovite on his way to work , mop ? ping his brow . " The heat is inhuman . It must be all those atomic tests . I do n't remember such a summer . " Indeed , no one does . Temperatures have soared into the 90 's in the shade and even hit more than 100 degrees F. the other day for what some wilting Russians say is the hottest July in 30 years . And , more accustomed to and happier in 20-degree-below-zero frosts , they are pouring into parks and countryside to sprawl out on a patch of grass and forget their meteo ? rologically induced misery . Beach No. 3 At Silver Pine Forest a pleasant green oasis within city limits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mass of crisping bodies on Sunday . To a foreign resident , it was also a small but vivid reminder of the gradually changing Soviet scene . The beach itself , with its unpainted wooden kiosks thronged with queues , the tumble-down booths where one can change clothes , and the uncut grass and weeds , retains that air of disheveled unconcern characteristic of so many state-run institutions . But , there are signsof thegrowingafflu- ence as welL-While  --  almost all the Russians had come to the beach by bus and express minibus , for instance , there were more Zhigulis ( Fiats ) and other private cars in the tiny parking lot than one saw last year . Shapes noticed At the water 's edge it was the shapes one noticed most . No longer just stocky middle-aged men and bosomy women plumply spilling out of makeshift swimsuits . But the large number of young girls wearing well-cut bikinis or colorful one-piece suits are much slenderer and comelier in figure than their parents . Then there were the young men , now sporting longish hair and often in faded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beach with a screaming tape recorder slung across his shoulder . As Muscovites concentrated on cooling off their physical temperature , meanwhile , Soviet officialdom was doing its best to heat up the ideological climate . Ever since the summit meeting Kremlin leaders have been lecturing Soviet citizens that they are not to mistake the " spirit of Moscow " for an ideological letdown . The Western " imperialists , " intoned Pravda and other newspapers this weekend , have not given up their efforts to undermine the Soviet state . Some politically immature Soviet citizens are falling under the influence of bourgeois propaganda . Russians must not weaken their vigilance . In short , the class struggle goes on . But class struggle seemed to be the last thing Moscovites wanted on a July afternoon  --  or any afternoon . Such exhortations and calls for vigilance have been rung periodically ever since Bolshevism came to power , and more and more they fall on unheeding ears . Summer reading At Silver Pine Forest the sound of Russian life seemed aeons away from the shrill urgings of Kremlin ideologues . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children , in the ' stern voice amplified from a passing militia speedboat telling swimmers to keep toward shore , in the yells of muscular young men kicking a soccer ball , and in the blend of lilting Russian folk songs and Western jazz issuing from transistor radios . It was to be heard , too , in the hum of animated conversation , which seemed to touch mostly on the weather and the much awaited chess match in Reykjavik . " Fischer behaved disgracefully , " said one tattooed youth . " Of course his conduct was bad , " conceded a friend , " but he knows what he 's doing . Say what you will , he 's got the world 's attention on that match . " // *Moscow heat // " Capablanca was temperamental too , " i chimed in another lad . " The point is Fischer 's a brilliant chess player , " " Do n't underestimate Spassky , " said the first youth . " He 's got lots of variants to his game . " Nearby a bald-headed man was lying contentedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him was a sheaf of newspapers , many with front - page editorials about " ideological work . " He was immersed , however , in a paperback copy of Arthur Bailey 's " Airport . " It did strike one as more entertaining reading for a hot summer day .
