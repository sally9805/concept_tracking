Manufacturers have long known that odor can be a powerful inducement to buy a product . Yet advertising men , finding smell too elusive a sensation to depict in words or pictures , tend to concentrate on the more easily communicated qualities of the goods that they tout . Now a process called " micro-encapsulation " is opening a promising new dimension for advertising by enabling readers to sniff a product 's aroma on the printed page . <P> In recent months , scented advertisements for such products as Fleischmann 's Gin , Gillette 's Foamy Surf-Spray Shaving Cream , and Carven Parfums ' Ma Griffe have been published in half a dozen magazines . The first newspaper ads using the process will appear this month . Because of extra production costs , a micro-fragrance ad often doubles the ordinary price for advertising . Still , Reach McClinton 's Robert Jaffe , an account executive for Ma Griffe perfume , which ran a micro-fragrance ad in four women 's magazines , maintains that the impact makes the high cost worthwhile . " You are putting before the consumer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what we are selling is smell . " <P> Efforts to find a practical way to add odors to advertisements have been going on for years . Scented ink was tried in newspapers in the ' 50s , but the fragrance dissipated too rapidly . The present process is supplied by only two companies , National Cash Register and Minnesota Mining &; Manufacturing , and the competition between them has spread from the marketplace to the courts . NCR , which claims that it developed the micro method first , has filed a patent-infringement suit against 3M . Minnesota Mining extracts a product 's aromatic oils to duplicate the product 's scent . The essences are enclosed in microscopic plastic bubbles , a million to a square inch . The capsules are coated on a paper strip , which is cut to size and affixed to each advertisement . A fingernail scratch ruptures the bubbles and releases the fragrance . NCR 's technique allows fragrances to be applied directly to published ads , eliminating the paper strips . <P> So far , 3M has developed about 100 aromas , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pine trees and orange juice . Officials at 3M and NCR envision a multimillion-dollar market for their process . For example , both companies are already studying the possibilities of attaching micro-fragrance strips to packages and cans of food . If the idea catches on , food shopping could become a nasal adventure .
