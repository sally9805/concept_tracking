txt ? The nuclear age gained its first strategic arms limitation treaty in the Kremlin last night . Its awkward name  --  commonly shortened to SALT ? is needed because the accord involves no disarmament . Its purpose is to freeze the balance of terrifying weapons and to make sure the terror works by preventing any effective defense against them . It is a major step forward in the already long history of nuclear arms negotiation . But it is also only a beginning . Both President Nixon and the Soviet Party chief , Leonid I. Brezhnev , vowed to press ahead toward further limitations and perhaps eventually even some reductions in arms . So this treaty is , likely to be known as SALT L It is a beginning , achieved after seven years of effort and 30 months of negotiation in one of those fleeting moments when-the two superpowers felt themselves strategic equals , despite inequality in the quality and number of their arms , and when their two leaders felt themselves strong enough politically to make the agreements stick . The arms race will go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and air force weaponry that is unaffected by the accord but also in the quality of nuclear warheads  --  that is , their size and accuracy and evasive skills  --  and in the arts of antisubmarine warfare and even in the technology of , the missile defense systems that the treaty is to limit severely at inadequate levels . Indeed , under certain conditions or political pressures , the treaty itself may stimulate further competition in these uncovered areas . And because the accord renounces those weapons that both sides think they now possess in sufficient number , it may not even save much money in future budgets . The United States had no plans to augment the land and submarine missiles and antimissile installations covered by the treaty . The energetic Soviet build-up of recent years was presumably intended primarily to reach a comfortable level before the freeze . The significance of the treaty lies in that it makes the freeze legally binding . It becomes an important weapon for political // leaders under constant pressure to add yet another new system to their arsenals and provides a major rebuttal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expenditures on arms by fears of what the adversary " may " be intending . The argument over this treaty in the United States will turn not on the old issue of inspection , which plagued the test-ban negotiations and many other arms proposals . By limiting only missile-launching systems , and not the warheads placed inside them , the accord requires only the location by space satellites of fairly large missile and radar installations and submarine construction sites . And it guarantees freedom to the satellites in space above the skies that the Soviet Union had long refused to open . Administration 's Answer The conservative opposition in the United States , as already indicated by Representative John Ashbrook , will argue that President Nixon has accepted at least a five-year inferiority in numbers of both land and sea-based missiles ? of up to 600 ? while the Soviet Union remains free to overcome the current American advantages in both the number and sophistication of the nuclear warheads atop those missiles . The Administration 's answer to these long-range fears is essentially threefold . First , it argues that only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Soviet Union numerically superior in every respect and that this is unlikely during the five years allowed for further agreement . If the interim freeze on offensive weapons were to lapse without renewal or extension , American officials said , the permanent freeze on defense systems would almost certainly be abandoned . Second , the Administration points out that without any limit on offensive weapons , the Soviet Union had the chance of continuing to add land and sea missiles at the recent rate of 250 a year while the next new American submarine system could not become operational until 1979 . Officials point out that it was the United States that insisted on including offensive weapons in the package and won a limit on submarines only last month under the deadline of the summit meeting . And third , the United States has long operated on the premise that numbers of missiles alone do not provide security , provided the disparity is not too great . Under three Presidents , it has held the view that effective defense against attack depends primarily on the ability to survive a first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unacceptable damage on the attacker . President Nixon has called this capacity to deter attack a matter of " sufficiency " and he has found the existing American nuclear arsenal sufficient for the indefinite future even before he had reason to expect the new agreements . I The problem of building a Istable and lasting balance of terror and deterrence , therefore , has centered on protecting the existing weapons against surprise attack and denying both sides the defenses that might make them think they could survive a counterattack . The new treaty limits missile defenses to two small systems , possibly good enough to protect the capital cities of Washington and Moscow against accidental attack or attack by a smaller nation and permitting further experimentation with defense technology . But the limits are deemed small enough to offer no hope of protection from a major Soviet or American strike . The low levels of permissible defenses and the limit on the number of gargantuan offensive missiles are deemed sufficient to make both sides confident that enough of their land-based missiles would survive a first strike to retaliate massively . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that neither side deems it possible to eliminate the sea-based missiles in a first strike ? at least in the predictable future . In sum , the fewer the available defenses , the more vulnerable each superpower remains to massive retaliation . The more vulnerable it remains , the fewer the temptations to risk an attack . That is the precarious but technically " stable " formula of deterrence underlying the new agreements . Some such stability has been held to be the essential first step before equal security can be sought at a lower level of armament . To make the equilibrium more enduring , the two superpowers will almost certainly find themselves talking soon about ways of expanding the limit on offensive weapons , restraining their quality and the number of warheads as well as the number of missile launchers now fixed . They will probably begin to consider ways of outlawing antisubmarine defenses of some future design and also curbing other weapons systems , like bombers and American missiles in Europe . In effect , the United States and the Soviet Union are on the paradoxical path of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other 's vulnerability to attack . In the process , the American and Soviet negotiators at this Moscow summit , as well as in the longer arms talks in Helsinki and Vienna , have reached an extraordinary degree of intellectual intimacy . It is doubtful that any two adversaries have ever exchanged so much knowledge of each other 's weapons and strategic doctrine and then sat together , like diligent stu ' dents of chess , to figure out alternate moves for either side that might yield one or another mutually desirable result . That has been the spirit reported by the American negotiators , led by the President and Henry A. Kissinger . Several of the sessions this week went past the Moscow dawn of 3 A.M. and in the final hours yesterday they went to the extraordinary length of sending joint instructions to their respective negotiating teams in Helsinki to avoid any lastminute misunderstanding in the translation of the Moscow bargaining into treaty language . Momentum for Talks It is this intimacy and spirit that the two sides expect to carry with new momentum into further arms talks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new habits of negotiation and consultation on a wider range of problems as well . Mr. Kissinger said this morning , for instance , that all the Soviet-American talks at this summit were equally candid and forthright , even though many other problems  --  presumably Vietnam foremost among them  --  were not susceptible to bilateral solution . Given the atmosphere that will flow from this accord , the support of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that Mr. Kissinger disclosed this morning and the generally liberal cast of the Senate on arms control issues , the President 's party expects no difficulty in obtaining ratiication by the Senate . The haste in which the Moscow teams drove for final agreement yesterday caused great confusions of social and business meetings , interspersed with three separate briefings for the press . But Mr. Kissinger finally appeared before the American press carps at 1 A.M. today and explained the arrangements with a wealth of numbers and concepts , which until that moment had been among the most closely guarded American secrets  --  from everyone except the Russians .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
