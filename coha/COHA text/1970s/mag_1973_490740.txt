THE TALK , OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment ON February 22nd , Senator Edward M. Kennedy rose on the floor of the Senate and submitted a bill , numbered S. 982 , that asked for the registration of all privately owned guns , stringent tests for anyone who wants to possess a gun , and a ban on all " hand-held firearms " that are not designed for sport . The Senator stated that twenty thousand people die by gunfire each year in the United States and that during the last Congress twenty-eight gun hills were introduced and none enacted , and he attributed that toll and that failure to act to the lung-standing resistance in this country to any form of gun control . " Since the day when Pilgrims landed at Plymouth Rock , guns have been an important part of American life , " he said . " Not only were they sources of pride and power but in those days they held the key to survival . For the frontiersman used his guns to provide food and clothing for his family , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who fashioned handsome pieces of weaponry earned high respect and esteem from his neighbors . The marksman who could fell a hear with a shot through an eye socket won the admiration of his villagers . And the lancer who could halt the charge of the redcoats took the medals of bravery .... America has always known guns . And her families have long admired the power and the might of a true marksman . But today in America our families no longer face the perils of a frontier wilderness . For the American family , . in 1973 , fear , apprehension , mistrust , anguish , and pain are the dreaded products of our firearms history .... We pay an enormous price for our heritage of guns . Over two hundred thousand gun crimes are committed in one year . Sixty-five per cent of the murders in 1972 involved guns . And at least eighty thousand aggravated assaults occurred with guns , while a hundred and twenty thousand robberies took place at gun point . By some estimates , guns are statistically like rats . They outnumber our population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the bloodiest pool of deaths by gunfire . We are not only ranked No. 1 , but No. 2 lags so far behind that a tally of gun deaths in all civilized nations probably would not equal the excessive fusillade we train on our fellow-citizens . " The only nation that has a worse record for homicide by firearms , Senator Kennedy added by way of a detailed chart , is El Salvador . The chart also demonstrated that in European countries where the gun is registered and the gun owner is licensed the rate of homicide by firearms is less than one-tenth of the rate of homicide by firearms in the United States . The Senator continued , " Violence and firearms are dreadfully intertwined . Causes of violence and the effects of firearms generate lively public dc-hates , from which one message emerges in Ame ri c a , there are too many guns . The statistics scrawl a profile that is all too clear Where gun ownership is highest , deaths caused by guns are also highest 1/111lh Americans are now dying 111 ) Pl1 a at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by guns . Another twenty thousand of our neighbors suffer gunshot injuries each year ; and approximately half of all suicides are accomplished with guns . Alarmingly , forty per cent of all accidental firearm fatalities are children between the ages of one and nineteen . " In a brief survey of the arguments against gun controls , the Senator dismissed one that still persuades all owners of guns and many non-owners : that gun controls will disarm innocent people but not gun-toting criminals . " I am convinced that gun restrictions can he effective in limiting the wholesale misuse of firearms , " he said . " Strict gun restrictions will aid in disarming any who fail to register their weapons nr obtain a license for ownership . Indeed , the enforcement of licensing and registration laws serves to isolate precisely those citizens who flout the law . For enactment of such legislation makes it a crime merely to possess an unregistered firearm . Commission of a crime with such a weapon compounds the wrong of any illegal act . " The Senator moved on to a descrip-tion of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as five years in prison , a fine of as much as five thousand dol-lars , or both ) , and concluded by saying , " Guns are made for one purpose only ? to put a bullet through something . Rea-sonable men can agree that no man deserves to hold the power of ending another 's life because of the indiscriminate use of such a lethal contrivance . Up to this point , this nation has not agreed on how to control that pow-er . Yet we have allowed , and indeed encouraged , a burgeoning explosion of these weapons of destruc-tion . I hope to join with all Americans who treas-ure the sanctity of life in seeking to bring a halt to the violence and carnage that we inflict upon each other , and bring an end to the violence and the killing guns cause . " The gun lobby 's extraordinary tal-ent for generating scores of thousands of letters , telegrams , telephone calls , petitions , and personal visits to members of Congress opposing any sensible fire-arms regulations will almost certainly defeat S. 982 ? unless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strict gun controls , who outnumber the opponents by more than two to one nationally , take the trouble to let their senators and representatives know how they feel , repeatedly and in even greater numbers . Collector TTING J. ROSENWALD , who is probably the greatest living collector of prints and illustrated books ranging from the fifteenth century to Picasso . came here , with his wife , from Jenkintown , Pennsylvania , the other day to open a dazzling Grolier Club show of hooks , manuscripts , and drawings from the Philip H. &; A. S. W. Rosenhach Museum , in Philadelphia , with a talk about the Rosenhachs . We met him that morning in the stately home and place of business of John Fleming , the antiquarian hook dealer , who bought the stock of the brothers ' business after they died ( Abraham in 1952 , Philip in 1953 ) . Mr. Rosenwald , the elder son of Julius Rosenwald , who was a founder of Sears , Roebuck &; Company , was a Rosenbach customer for more than three decades ( and is now a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was the first president  --  of the Rosenbach Foundation , which was set up in 1948 , and which runs the museum . " I first met him in 1927 , when we were in a house at 273 Madison Avenue , " Mr. Fleming said as we awaited the arrival of the evening 's speaker , who was driving up . " He had an appointment to come in around five in the evening , and Doctor " ? A. S. W. , a Ph.D. , was often given this sobriquet ? " asked me to stay and assist : bring books out , and so on . / was seventeen . Lessing stayed an hour or so , and when he was leaving / watched him go down the long hall with Doctor , turn around , and come hack alone . John , I forgot to say gond night , ' he said . A kind and considerate man . He used to be shy , but he is n't anymore . He never bargains . He 's the pioneer Blake collector  --  books and drawings  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hooks and manuscripts to the Library of Congress , and similar donations of prints to the National Gallery of Art . The Library gave a dinner party for him last month in its Great Hall  --  the first in the seventy-five-year history of the building  --  with a hundred and thirty-four guests , on his eighty-second birthday , February 10th . Eighty-two of his rare books , now the Library 's , were on display . " The celebrated collector arrived at this point . He is a powerfully built , clean-shaven man with rugged features and a serious , forthright , genial manner . He went to work in his father 's business in Chicago after a stay at Cornell , and in i 920 moved to Philadelphia to become manager of a new Sears plant there . ( He retired from business at forty-eight , as chairman of the board . ) " My father had made such a name in Chicago that I rather enjoyed living in another city , " he told us . " I wanted to get out in the sunlight , I loved Philadelphia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the suburb of JenkinMANCH 109 1973 town , where he recently gave most of his hundred-and-fifty-acre place , including a big house , to the township , for a park and community center . The Rosenwalds now occupy a smaller house , but a great gallery adjoining the big house still contains his collection , which , along with a research library , is open to scholars by appointment . When did he start collecting ? " / used to pass Charles Sessler 's bookshop , on Walnut Street , in the nineteen-twenties , and one day I saw a print by D . Y. Cameron in the window . I bought it for a few dollars . I took it home and thought , Why the hell did I buy this thing ? So I started reading up on prints . Well , in the late nineteen-twenties some-wonderful sales of earl ) prints were coming up in Germany . I asked Dick Sessler , Charles ' son , to go over and buy them for his own account and then give me first choice . I offered him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay for his trip I 'd make up the cost . He sailed that afternoon , and bought very heavily . I took practically everything he bought . That was the start of a mania . I was really launched . Most of the things I got were woodcuts of the same type as those in early illustrated hooks , and this led me into that field . Doctor pushed inc further into it . He used to stress condition and quality . ' Not good enough , ' he sometimes said to me when I wanted to buy something . ' A hotter cop ) will come along . ' " Why arc most of the Rosenwald things still in Jenkintown rather than in Washington ? " I started giving them away in 1943 , when you could give recipient institutions tide , retain lifetime possession , and take a tax deduction . The law was changed in the nineteen-sixties so that if you wanted deductibility you had to deliver . Since then , I 've retained tide to new purchases , but I send them to the Library of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm leaving them to these places in my will . The new law is interesting , Suppose for tax reasons you give a painting over a period of four years . You have to hang it in the recipient gallery for three months the first year , six months the next year , nine months the third year , and all of the last year . " Mrs. Rosenwald came in to carry her husband off for lunch , and we rose to leave . " Both Doctor and his brother were great gourmets , " Mr. Rosenwald said . " After Philip died , the trustees of the Foundation went over the shop . On the top floor we found a walled-off space , with a damp tiled floor , containing a dozen live diamondback terrapins . We arranged a dinner featuring them . It was the only dividend the trustees got . " Tilt RTY objections to a small  --  a very small  --  crusade ? It concerns pinball machines . A pinball machine , as everybody knows , is a device that sells fun . The player pops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fun . The fun takes the form of a steel ball zigging and zagging its way around a garish playfield loaded with bumpers , rollovers , roll-tinders , kickers , flippers , and gates . The player , who is likely to become One with the Machine in fairly short order , pushes buttons to flip the flippers and applies body English . ( An excess of the latter activates the dread " Tilt , " ending play . ) Lights flash , hells ring , enormous scores rack up . If the score gets high enough  --  thirty-five thousand points , for example  --  a satisfying grwockl is heard , and the player has won a free game . Pinball is a blatantly American pastime ( what could be more American than mechanical fun-vending ? ) that is enjoyed in many parts of the world . The locals love it in Boston , Philadelphia , and San Francisco , and in London , Paris , Rome , and Tokyo as well . It would he logical to conclude that pinball and civilization are natural companions were it not for one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no pinball . We were more or less unaware of this omission until relatively recently , when , our appetite whetted by a couple of out-of-town pinball sessions , we tried to locate a machine on our home bill . A fact-finding tour of bars and amusement arcades from Morning-side Heights to Coney Island , however , failed to turn up a single one . At the Playland on Broadway below Forty-seventh Street , for example , we found a positive glut of coin-operated ersatz rifles , pistols , rocket launchers , machine guns , missiles , torpedoes , and cosmic death rays , but no pinballs . We did discover three devices that resembled pinball games in certain respects  --  they had flippers  --  hut they lacked bumpers and they did not award free games . To mistake them for real pinball machines would be like confusing a dog race with the Belmont Stakes . Our subsequent researches disclosed that , unlike drinking , swearing , and staying out all night , pinball is against the law in our town . Chapter 32 , Article 5 of the City of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and dealing with the licensing of bocce alleys and the like , specifically excludes any contraption of " the type , design , class or construction commonly known as a pinball or bagatelle " from those devices which may be approved for the diversion of the citizenry . Furthermore , the law drones on , no one is to be permitted to play with " any machine , apparatus , paraphernalia or amusement device upon the playing surface of which exist any bumpers , obstructions or obstacles other than the holes or receptacles for which the propelled object is ultimately destined , nor one which is so constructed as to permit the re-use of the device without the insertion of another coin . " Well ! This state of affairs , we found , seems to he a case of mistaken identity . Back in the nineteen-thirties , one of the targets of municipal indignation was the slot machine , which fleeced the poor of their nickels and furnished organized crime with a rich source of income . Mayor LaGuardia personally administered the sledgehammer to a large number of one-armed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The bad guys , ever ingenious , came up with gambling devices designed to resemble the innocuous pinball machine . These gambling pinball machines , which are still in operation in Nevada and elsewhere but are no longer manufactured in any great numbers , have twenty-five holes arranged in rows on their play-fields , and they pay off on the principle of bingo . They never have flippers . They often employ a nefarious adaptation of the free-game feature , whereby the player may run up as many as nine hundred and ninety-nine free games . If a cop happens to he hanging around , the player plays his replays until the coast is clear , and then the attendant pays him his winnings  --  the payoff for nine hundred and ninety-nine free games on a nickel machine would he forty-nine dollars and ninety-five cents  --  and presses a concealed button , which clears the replay indicator and records the cleared replays on a meter attached to the coin box . The gambling operator thus has a record of payoffs and earnings . Unlike real pinball , the game itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the machine always wins . It takes only a little discernment to tell the difference between the two moral grades of pinball , but the authorities were disinclined to split hairs . They banned the " good " pinball machines along with the " had , " like cops bustling a bystander into a paddy wagon at a demonstration . We discussed all this last week at the Princeton Club with Rufus King , a Washington lawyer , who represents D. Gottlieb &; Company and Williams Electronics , the two biggest manufacturers of amusement pinball machines . 11.1r . King , who is big , bald , and urbane , and who wears half spectacles on the end of his nose , knows a lot about gambling . He has served as counsel to most of the congressional committees that have investigated the subject , in-chiding the famous Kefauver Committee of 1951 , and he has written a hook called " Gambling and Organized Crime . " He is not a pinball addict himself , but he has a certain distant sympathy with the condition . " Pinball machines promote idleness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he told us . " And idleness is what 's happening more and more across the country , with increased leisure and the renaissance of bowling and pool , which also had a shady image . A pinball machine is just a five- or ten-cent bowling alley . We really are pulling away from this old goofy , irrational taint . " We asked Mr. King about the legal prognosis for pinball in New York City , and he said , " There 's some interest in modifying the city ordinance , which , like most municipal law , is incredibly archaic . It ought at least to he brought into line with state law , which allows machines of the add-a-ball type  --  no free games , just extra balls . But one has to proceed cautiously , because the gambling promoters are always looking for an angle . Once they 're involved , water starts to flow uphill rind the sun starts rising in the west . We ca n't fight fire with fire when it comes to carrying black hags around legislatures . Gottlieb and Williams are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We just do n't have the muscle . Now , if we were paving contractors , or something ... " Mr. King sighed . " Perspectives differ , " he said . " For the people directly involved , the illegality of pinball is a total wrong , but for the people who are responsible for making the Great Decisions it 's not a hig enough deal . " We made a few phone calls , and the people we talked with tended to confirm one or another of Mr. King 's points . " The guy who wrote that law must have been drunk at the law-enforcement official told us . " I 've got more important things to worry about , " he added . We called Meyer Parkoff , president of the Seaboard New York Corporation , which is a big distributor of coin machines , and he told Lis that n big drive just to legalize pinball would n't be worth the trouble . " It does n't pay us to knock our brains out , " he said . " We got other games to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called Henry J. Stern , the First Deputy Commissioner of Consumer Affairs , and asked him if he knew of any justification for keeping pinball in the doghouse . Mr. Stern treated us gingerly , as if he were dealing with an unpredictable but probahlv harmless crank . " I guess it 's viewed as an unsavory , vaguely inappropriate kind of thing , " he said . " The basic feeling is that one does n't want games of chance  --  unless they 're governinentoperated , of course . " Our own view is that whether or not pinball is a game of chance is not a question of fact but a philosophical issue , like Free Will , but we did n't press the point . " A lot of these regulatory cobwebs are in need of a dusting , " Mr. Stern went on . " If anyone took the time and trouble to follow it through , maybe the law would he changed . But you work on the things that cause you problems . " The difficulty seems to be that pinball fans just have n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has nothing to do with race , creed , or ethnicity ; nor is it , strictly-speaking , a sexual preference . Pinball is a form of solitaire . Tile attention span required for the game is extremely shot t . It ha rdly seems likely that a bunch of people who are by definition fickle loiters will band together to demand their rights , but if they do we 'll he with them . Meanwhile , pinball remains one of the valid reasons for piing to New jersey . The Space THE Space for Innovative Development is on West Thirty-sixth Street , in the heart of the garment district , an area whose inhabitants are said to live by their wits alone , It occupies what was until three years ago Christ Church  --  a vast brick , Presbyterian pile built in 1903 , when this was a fashionable residential neighborhood . A few years ago , the church decided to sell the property , and it would probably have been demolished for commercial development if it had not come to the attention of Samuel Rubin and his wife , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit musical " No , Na , Nanette . " The Rubins wanted to help experimental theatrical groups in need of rehearsal and performing space . The Samuel Rubin Foundation bought the property in 1970 and began extensive renovations , which have not yet been completed . The Space , as it has come to be known , is nevertheless in full operation along the- lines that the Rubins envisaged , and we went down there to see what was going on . " The original idea was that this would become home base for several theatre , dance , and other companies , whose proximity would result in a lot of cross-fertilization , " we were told by David Shaw , an irresistibly enthusiastic voting man , who manages the building . " So far , not too much of that has happened , but the building is certainly being used . " Currently in residence , he said , are the Alwin Nikolais and Mu  --  ray Louis dance theatres , the Open Theatre , Free Life Communications ( an improvisational music ensemble ) , the Multigravitational Experiment ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( musicians experimenting with new forms of contemporary opera ) , Space Videnarts ( which documents performers ' works on videotape ) , and congeries of visiting artists , who rent space by the day or week , at exceptionally congenial rates . " We do n't have a city license to operate as a theatre yet , because the elevator strike held up the renovations , " Mr. Shaw explained . " But most of the groups give workshop performances and ask for contributions , and they 're usually soul out . " Alwin Nikolais , he said , was in Germany at the moment , staging an electronic spectacle for the Hamburg Opera , but his company was upsviirs rehearsing , and would we like to see it ? We would . Shaw took us up a flight of stairs and into what was formerly a gy M nasium , where we found Murray Louis working with the Nikolais dancers . One end of the- gym was hung with narrow , very long triangles of white cloth , like sails , which the dancers could move laterally ; slide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taped electronic score " if this is the high point of our day , then I say something is radically wrong . " reverberated from several loudspeakers . " Nikolais and Louis have worked together so long that either can take over in cases like this , " Shaw told us . " As you probably know , Louis was a featured dancer in the Nikolais company for years . He formed his own group in 1969 . Both companies are presenting new works , and while Nik 's away Murray is working on Nik 's new piece . " The dancers took a break , and Louis , a compact , dark-haired man with quick movements and a mobile face , came over and joined us . The new Nikolais dance , he said , was called " Grotto . " " It 's an underworld sort of thing , " he added . " A lot of secret little ceremonies underground . The atmosphere is meant to be grotesque and a little  --  you know  --  creepy . " We asked Louis about his own new dance . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've already previewed it -- at Duke University  --  and I was endlessly relieved , because it really worked . The full title is ' Index ... ( to necessary neuroses ) ! It deals with those little nerve endings and neuroses of daily life . I always try to make a new piece as different as possible from the last , and I had been feeling that my own company  --  which is very beautiful physically  --  was getting almost too wholesome . So I 've tried to extend it into a new area . Nik did a stunning job of lighting it  --  he lights all my . work -- and Frank Garcia 's costumes are just right . I know I 've got a winner . " Louis went hack to the dancers , and Shaw offered to show us the other studios . There are seven studios , he said , including the main theatre , in the church proper , which is not yet ready for occupancy . We saw the music room , on the fifth floor , where Free Life Communications and Quog work on alternate evenings ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , and the fourth-floor " circus room , " used by the Multigravitational Experiment , with trapezes and rubber inner tubes hanging from a sort of scaffirlding ( a multigravitationalist was working out on the floor , doing what looked like Tai Chi Chuan exercises ) ; and two smaller rooms , where dancers were doing any number of odd things . The Open Theatre has its studio on the ground floor , and Shaw explained that its members did not want anyone to watch them do their exercises ; the window in their dour , in fact , is blacked out to discourage peepers . " But they 'll do a series of performances this month in their studio , " he said . Shaw told us that he had come to work for Space , as director of media , in 1970 , soon after graduating from liarpur College with a degree in philosophy . " They were having all sorts of problems with the renovations , and they had nobody to watch over things here , so I was pulled into this job , " lie said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he the beginning of a new kind of environment where artists can work together . It also might be the philosophical factory I 've been looking for but never really expected to find . "
