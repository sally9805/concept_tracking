ROBIN AND MARIAN <P> Directed by RICHARD LESTER Screenplay by JAMES GOLDMAN <P> Robin Hood is having some trouble keeping pace with his legend . A bright , boisterous man with an occasional taste for reflection , he reasons that a man who reaches 40 has had a good and generous life . Since he and Little John both are some years past the mark , Robin supposes that they have been particularly blessed . <P> Such insights help tide them over some of life 's disappointments . Certainly the Crusades , which have consumed nearly 20 years of the pair 's life when the film opens , were not all they should have been , and when the mad , majestic Richard Lionheart finally dies , Robin and Little John leave France with no regrets , riding north for England and Sherwood Forest . There , everything seems familiar . Robin and Little John come upon Friar Tuck and Will Scarlett , who are hunting deer in the forest . Now Richard 's brother John is King , and their old adversary , the sheriff , still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to date by singing a popular ballad about the putative exploits of the merry men in their pre-Crusades youth . " But , Will , " Robin protests , pleased , " we never did any of those things . " Then he asks about Marian . <P> This sentimental , flawed but quite wonderful movie is about romance and reunion , about people trying to measure up to the myths created about them . <P> <P> Robin and Marian flirts with serious trouble a couple of times but is saved from lasting damage by a particularly bracing conspiracy of talents . Toward the end of the film , when adversary armies led by Robin and the sheriff face each other across a plain , Robin proposes that instead of both forces clashing , the battle be " settled with champions . " The movie is resolved and enhanced in much the same way . <P> Almost everyone involved with Robin and Marian could be a champion .

There is also the ravishing cinematography of David Watkin , who makes Sherwood into a forest well suited to legend . Particularly there is Sean Connery 's Robin Hood , Nicol Williamson 's Little John , Robert Shaw 's winter-eyed Sheriff , Audrey Hepburn 's Maid Marian-and Richard Lester , a film maker of deft wit and frequent brilliance . <P> Zest for Buffoonery . James Goldman 's sweet-spirited script owes much to his previous The Lion in Winter , although Robin and Marian lacks the lofty airs that marred its predecessor . Marian has taken the veil , but presides over a tiny abbey with worldly animation . She swears with precision and puts up a heated battle when Robin insists on saving her from the sheriffs clutches . She would as soon go to prison , but she has little choice in the matter . Robin slings her over the back of a horse as if she were a saddlebag . <P>
