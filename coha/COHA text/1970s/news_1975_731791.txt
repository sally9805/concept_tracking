txt Arnold Constable , New York City 's oldest specialty store , will close late next month after 150 years of existence and a half-century on Fifth Avenue . Increasing expenses and the need to spend a " large sum " for modernization were cited yesterday by Merwin Bayer , president of the Arnold Constable Corporation , as the reasons for the decision to close the stor , the last of 11 once operated under the Constable name . The company will now concentrate on its more successful NoName apparel shops in suburban shopping centers , in which he said , " our return on investment is much better and which we plan to aggressively expand . " In the last decade Constable closed 10 suburban branch stores after they had suffered increasing loss of sales and profits . The development of large , regional shopping centers took business from suburban core districts . Last July , the store on Fifth Avenue at 40th Street , after a series of space cutbacks was reduced from 125,000 square feet on three floors to 30,000 square feet on one floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once one of New York 's finest carriage-trade stores . During the nineteen-twenties , the street in front of Constable 's was frequently the scene of limousines and chauffeurs waiting for affluent women of the period to make their purchases within the store . But , as the city 's big , promotion-oriented department stores expanded and larger specialty stores opened on Fifth Avenue , the Constable store lost its impact and hold on the shopping public . And its quick embrace of the suburban shopping trend proved Ito be a two-edged sword as the ' locations in the suburban central districts began in the nineteen-sixties to suffer from the entry of larger and larger shopping centers only a few miles ! away . The first Constable store , in lower Manhattan , was started lin 1825 by Aaron Arnold , an immigrant from the Isle of Wight who became a wellknown Manhattan merchant . The Arnold store obtained the second halt of its name when an English lace salesman , James Constable , called on Mr. Arnold with his wares . Mr. Constable married Mr. Arnold 's daughter and became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Isaac Liberman , who was the : president of Stewart &; Co. in the nineteen-twenties and remained the long-time chairman of Constable after it merged with Stewart , New York 's first department store , about 1925 . Mr. Liberman , now 89 years old , retired in 1967 . ' Small Operating Profit ' ' The Fifth Avenue store ended its fiscal year Jan. 31 with a " small operating profit " and sales of about $5-million , according to Mr. Bayer . Total sales of Constable 's , including the Fifth Avenue store , nine NoName apparel shops and one shop , known as Garment District , in Wayne , N. J. , were about $9-million . But the small shops " have enjoyed big sales . increases , such as 25 per cent in December and 40 per cent in January , " he said , " and the results have been extraordinarily good . " The small stores have turned in " substantial profits , " he said . Total company results are not yet available because of accounting efforts still under way on real estate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name , Mr. Bayer said . " We can get a much better return on our investment and expand more rapidly by concentrating on the regional mall suburban shops , " he said , " than by diluting our capital and efforts on two separate kinds of businesses . " The Fifth Avenue store property is owned by the New York Public Library , which several years took over the building 's fourth , fifth and sixth floors for its Mid-Manhattan branch . Richard Couper , president of the New York Library system , was not available yesterday afternoon for comment on the system 's plans for the streetfront to be vacated . 120 Employes in Store pany , Best &; Co. , Saks 34th ' Street , Black , Starr &; Frost ' and Hearn 's . The NoName shops , which ' sell " tops and bottoms " of ap ; parel for both women and ' men , will be doubled in number to about 20 within the next year , according to Mr.1 Bayer . " We could have opened Arnold Constable stores , selling a diversity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stores , " he said , " but suitable sites were hard to come by and the cost probably would have been prohibitive . " The NoName shops average about 2,000 square feet . Mr. Bayer said that the Fifth Avenue store 's closing had no connection with the announceSunday , of termination of an agreement that called for the Arnold Constable Corporation to take over control of the Tweed Ladies Fashion Boutiques from the Kay Corporation . A $3.3-million note to be paid by Constable would have been convertible by Kay into a controlling interest in Arnold Constable . Kay , which operates leased jewelry departments in shopping centers , is 70 per cent controlled by the Bowater Corporation , Ltd. , London , a leading producer of pulp and paper . " We simply could not get together with Kay on the terms of the transaction , " Mr. Bayer said . Constable invoked a cancellation clause in its lease with the New York Public Library and expects to close the store late in March after selling out its current inventory and goods on order . Mr. Bayer said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jobs for many of the 120 employes still working in the Fifth Avenue store . " Our closing here completes a cycle of disposition of about 500,000 square feet we have occupied , " he added , " and the transformation of our business to the closed-mall , specialty type shop . " The disappearance of Arnold Constable as an old retailing name continues a trend . Recent years have seen the passing of such famous Manhattan retailers as James McCreery &; Sons , the A.
