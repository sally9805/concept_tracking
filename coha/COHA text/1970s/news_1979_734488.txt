txt President Carter has moved visibly forward on the strength of his performance in the Iranian crisis and on Sen. Edward M. Kennedy 's blunder in attacking the Shah . Could it be a turning point for the President ? This Was the question being asked in Washington political circles in the wake of the Massachusetts Senator 's depiction of the deposed Shah of Iran as a leader who " ran one of , the most violent regimes in the history of mankind " and stole " umpteen billions " from his nation . The criticism of Mr. Kennedy for his remarks has come from leaders of both parties and of both conservative and liberal political philosophies . The consensus : that this was no time to make such comments , that it may have endangered the hostages , and that it may well encourage those holding the hostages to believe there is a large segment of the American people who would like to have the Shah sent back to Iran . But tha political assessment here is even harsher : Some critics are even going so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blunder comparable to the Chappaquiddick incident in its capacity to drag his presidential candidacy down . Others ? more cautious ? are saying that the Kennedy blunder may not have a lasting impact . But even before Senator Kennedy had committed his blooper concerning the Shah , a new ABC-Louis Harris poll confirmed what has been sensed for several weeks , ? that Mr. Carter is closing in on the Senator in popularity . The poll showed the President leading Mr. Kennedy 42 to 40 percent among Democrats and independents . Among Democrats , the Senator was given a 44 to 40 edge . In November , Mr. Kennedy had a 46 to 32 lead over Mr. Carter among Democrats and independents and a 50 to 32 advantage among Democratic voters . // From page 1 Kennedy 's ' blooper ' ? windfall for Carter Obviously , the Iranian crisis has , quite suddenly , repaired the President 's public image . People now are perceiving him as performing in a restrained , responsible , strong manner . However , the President 's campaign chairman , Robert Strauss , talking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poll ? saying that some of the support for the President shown therein might not hold . He implied that there could be a decided falloff of that support should , in the end , the President fail to achieve an outcome of the Iranian crisis that retains the present favorable public perception . But Mr. Strauss was obviously having difficulty in containing his elation over the way events now are playing into the President 's hands . In fact , at one point Mr. Strauss outlined a scenario in which Senator Kennedy would be knocked out of the race fairly early . Meanwhile , the President was announcing his candidacy with much less fanfare and activity than first planned . Vice-President Walter Mondale was doing the major job of substituting for Mr. Carter at major fund raisers set to accompany the announcement . Nonetheless , Mr. Strauss said the Carter campaign expected to raise $2.5 million from the fund raisers , including some 2,700 small get-togethers of Carter supporters which will be taking place in connection with the announcement . Senator Kennedy 's " rationale for running is disappearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was running to help those Democrats in Congress who are up for election . Yet we soon will have more than one-half of Democrats in Congress endorsing the President . And I do n't see this kind of support getting behind Kennedy . "
