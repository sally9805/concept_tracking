txt column missing and a sophisticated chemistry laboratory able to follow up leads like those being developed aboard Viking 1 . The scientists emphasized at a news conference that life had neither been confirmed nor ruled out on Mars . The Viking scientists at ? the Jet Propulsion Laboratory here , reviewing what has been found to date , were asked what soil of readings would definitely show signs of life . Dr. Harold Klein , head of the Viking team , said the most likely prospect is a socalled gas exchange experiment , which is designed to incubate a soil sample for up to several months . If this experiment , which now shows very little change in its conditions , were to experience wide swings in the content of a particular gas or to shift from the type of reaction called oxidation to its opposite , called reduction , this would be a sign of life , Dr. Klein said . Dr. Leslie Orgel of the Salk Institute of Biological Studies in La Jolla , Calif. , said an indication of life would be readings from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ? a mass spectrometer , showing that only one of a related group of organic compounds was in the soil , rather than the random collection one would expect from nonbiological processes . Dr. Gerald Soffen of the Langley Research Center in Hampton , Va. , leader of the Viing science team , said another sign would be a sustained increase in the activity studied by a so-called labeled release experiment , now showing little change , that would indicate cells growing and multiplying . In an interview , Dr. Alexander Rich of the Massachusetts Institute of Technciogy noted that the desert-like appearance of Mars is probably little different from that on Earth until large-scale organisms began to evolve less than a billion years ago . He speculated that chemical evolution on Mars , building up toward the possibility of life , may have gone more slowly than on Earth , so slowly that Mars may still be " pre-biotic . " There is another possibility , he said . The organisms , if any , on Mars are likely to be quite different from those known on Earth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their waste products , leaving no complex organic byproduct to be detected by such instruments as the gas chromatograph mass spectrometer . At the news conference , Dr. Orgel said : " We do n't know any nonbiological materials on Earth that behave like Martian soil . But we have n't looked at many terrestrial samples in simulated Martian environments . " Dr. Orgel said , " We 're going to have to do a lot more chemistry on Earth , " and added , " I feel sure that this is the beginning of something interesting , even if it 's just chemistry on Mars . " Dr. Lederberg said at the news conference that data from Viking 1 were " very perplexing . " He added that the project was at " a very puzzling , difficult and tendentious stage . " Dr. Lederberg said : " Mars is seething with chemical activity on the surface to an extent that is surprising . No one expected to find the degree of oxidative activity . " Those who explain the activity as strictly nonbiological , he said , have yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he said , " there is no reason to exclude chemistry inside cells . " The equipment aboard Viking was limited in its size , weight and function by the $1 billion that the project had available to spend . This was far less than was once envisoned for a series of larger Voyager craft to be launched by Saturn moon rockets . Dr. Lederberg said : " We do n't have very many options . There are a very limited number of things to do . " For confirmatory " control " experiments , a sample can either be reused or not , sterilized or not , or incubated in the dart or in the light , Dr. Lederberg noted . Programming the Viking computer to perform a new test takes time , he added . Dr. Lederberg said that many living processes . could be mimicked by nonliving chemistry .
