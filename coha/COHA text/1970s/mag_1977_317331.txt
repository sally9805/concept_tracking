" There 's going to be a battle royal , " predicted one Republican official nine weeks ago when Mary Louise Smith quit as the G.O.P. 's national chairman . A wise forecast : the Republicans promptly began a raucous free-for-all-in the best brawling style of the Democrats-to decide who should get the job . Last week 161 members of the National Committee finally convened in Washington 's Hilton Hotel and , after three ballots , settled on a compromise candidate : former U.S. Senator William Brock III of Tennessee . <P> As the fray developed , President Ford 's choice was his efficient and low-keyed campaign manager , James Baker of Texas . Early in January , Ford endorsed Baker , but he was opposed by Ronald Reagan , and John Connally was indifferent . Baker had some other problems as well . Word got out that he had $1.8 million left in the campaign kitty last fall and failed to spend it during Ford 's come-from-behind stretch drive . <P> That money could have paid for advertising in Hawaii and Ohio , where a switch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the White House . In his defense , Baker claimed that the funds had been allocated to the state chairmen , who failed to use all of them . Still , a political realist , Baker dropped out of the race early last week . Said he : " I did n't have the fire in my gut to go through with it . " <P> That left Utah National Committeeman Richard Richards , Reagan 's man , to fight strenuously to the end for the job . To woo the moderates , Richards downplayed his Reagan connection by promising , if elected , to " favor any candidate of any political philosophy . " <P> But his lack of national recognition handicapped him , as did his concession to committee members : " I 'm a technician . " Managed by longtime Reagan Operative Lyn Nofziger , Richards got only 48 out of the 81 votes required to win on the first two ballots-coming in second both times-but he could not build on his conservative base . <P> Brock engineered his victory by presenting himself as everyone 's second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after James Sasser , a former chairman of Tennessee 's Democratic Party , took away his Senate seat in November . But the handsome Brock , heir to a candy making fortune , is a good nuts-and-bolts organizer who is conservative enough for Reagan 's people though he backed Ford for the presidency last year . He has opposed foreign aid and handgun licensing , but did vote with the liberals against no-knock legislation . <P> Warring Wings . Early on , Brock helped defuse fears that he would use the chairmanship as a launching pad for a try at becoming Governor of Tennessee in 1978 . Promising to serve as party leader through 1980 , Brock maintained : " You ca n't take this job if you are interested in your own candidacy . " Even so , only Baker 's withdrawal sealed the victory for Brock . The winner promptly declared that he would strive to bridge the ideological split between the two warring wings of the Republicans . He got some strong support from Richards , who confessed that he had been getting ready to vote for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems with Brock . He 's a good conservative , and we 'll work hard with him . "
