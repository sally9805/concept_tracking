txt President Ford is proposing income tax cuts about as large as President-Elect Carter is expected to suggest , but from a very different standpoint . Mr. Ford 's tax program for calendar 1977 ? $10 billion tax relief for individuals , $2.5 billion for business ? would be roughly matched by cuts in federal spending which the President is expected to outline in his fiscal 1978 budget . ? Mr. Ford 's effort , in other words , is to reduce the tax burden on Americans , without greatly increasing federal budget deficits . " To increase the deficit to further stimulate the economy , " said Treasury Secretary William E. Simon in a reference to Mr. Carter 's reported plan , would be " unnecessary and unwise . " // From page 1 *Ford would cut taxes spending The President-Elect , in an economic package to be unveiled shortly , reportedly would increase federal spending , not decrease it , in an effort to create several hundred thousand public service jobs . Spending for jobs , coupled with tax reductions in the range of $10 billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $70 billion , if Congress follows Mr. Carter 's reported plan . In his tax cut proposals , Mr. Carter is expected to grant the most relief to low and lower middle-income people ? those , perhaps , below the $15,000 income level . President Ford , by contrast , aims his tax relief primarily at the middle class ? those with up to a $30,000 yearly income ? claiming that low-income Americans already have benefited from tax reductions in the last two years . Americans at the lowest end of the scale , in fact , would pay more taxes under Mr. Ford 's proposal , because of increases in the social security payroll tax . These increases would more than offset income tax reductions at the bottom of the scale . Social security burden To keep the social security program solvent , Mr. Ford proposes stepped increases over the next three years in the amount employees and employers contribute to the plan . To help business accumulate investment capital , President Ford offers a number of tax benefits , including a reduction of the maximum corporate tax rate from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 10 percent investment tax credit , now due to revert to 7 percent in 1980 , and would allow a speedier tax write-off for new plant and equipment in areas with unemployment rates of 7 percent or higher . Mr. Carter , who stresses the need of corporations to invest capital to create jobs , also is expected to offer tax relief to business . Congress has the last word on writing taxes and , with both houses firmly in Democratic hands , is expected to give more weight to Mr. Carter 's wishes than to President Ford 's . Some observers see in President Ford 's one-two punch on taxes and the budget an effort to draw a clear distinction between Republican and Democratic economic policies . Republicans in the 1978 congressional elections and in the 1980 presidential race , it is argued , would point to Mr. Ford 's warning against increased government spending . Mr. Carter , too , aims at a balanced budget by fiscal 1981 . He appears to be convinced , however , that the economy needs extra stimulus now to create jobs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
