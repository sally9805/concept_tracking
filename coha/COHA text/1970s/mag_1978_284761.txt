For India 's langur monkeys , infanticide works <P> In his classic work On Aggression , Nobel Laureate Konrad Lorenz argued that man is the only species that regularly kills its own kind . This concept , which contrasted the order and restraint in the animal world with the chaotic aggressiveness of man . reflected the mood of the time : the shadow-of-the-Bomb pessimism of the ' 50s and early ' 60s . But Lorenz was wrong ; since 1963 , when his book was published , naturalists have identified dozens of species that kill their own , including lions , hippos , bears , wolves , hyenas , herring gulls and more than 15 types of primates other than man . <P> In the new perspective , animals are not benign machines that live for the group and kill only to eat . Instead , they are programmed for selfish , even murderous acts when survival and propagation are threatened . This radical shift in thinking is shown most dramatically by studies of India 's sacred monkey , the hanuman langur . In 1965 , a naturalist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relaxed " and " nonaggressive . " Now , a Harvard researcher has shown that the langur society operates more like the House of Borgia , complete with kidnaping , constant sexual harassment , group battles , abandonment of some wounded young by their mothers , and the regular practice of infanticide . <P> In her new book . The Langurs of Abu , Harvard Anthropologist Sarah Blaffer Hrdy , 31 , portrays langur life as a " soap opera " that revolves around the struggle between the sexes . As in other species , the strongest males compete for control of each troop . What makes the langurs different is that the winner tries to bite to death the young offspring of his predecessor . The mothers resist the infanticide until the struggle looks hopeless , then pragmatically present themselves to the new ruler for copulation . <P> Why so brutal a society ? Hrdy believes that the answer lies in the theory of sociobiology , which holds that each organism is engaged in a one-against-all struggle to get as many of its genes as possible into the next generation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other species ; it usually makes evolutionary sense for males to inseminate the maximum number of females . But why infanticide ? Hrdy reasons that the grisly practice evolved among the langurs to solve a problem for the new dominant male . Because of the competition of other males , his reign over a harem or troop is usually short , and his genetic drive dictates that he impregnate the females as quickly as possible . As Hrdy explains : " By eliminating infants in the troop that are unlikely to be his own , a usurping male hastens the mother 's return to sexual receptivity and reduces the time that will elapse before she bears his offspring . " <P> Hrdy , who spent 1,500 hrs. observing langur behavior around India 's Mount Abu from 1971 to 1975 , documented the disappearances of 39 infants around the times of new male takeovers ; she estimates that only half of all langurs survive infancy . While males shift constantly among groups , females usually spend a lifetime in one troop and cooperate in warding off danger .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
