txt After a year of campaigning , during which Most politicians and every poll agreed that Senator Edmund S. Muskie of Maine led the Democratic Presidential race , a new contest appeared to have started tonight . Some of Senator Muskie 's senior advisers agreed with what seemed to be the consensus  --  that Mr. Muskie ceased to be the front-runner when Gov . George C. Wallace of Alabama captured the bulk of Florida 's 81 convention delegates . Mr. Wallace now has 75 committed convention votes , more than any other candidate . As the returns for the Florida primary cascaded in , few peapie were able to name a Democratic favorite . With an assist from the Alabama Governor 's potent showing , the other national Democrats accomplished in Florida what they had been hoping for months to do : vanquish Muskie . The man from Maine finished a weak fourth after , having won unimpressively in the New Hampshire primary only a week ago . Mr. Muskie will try to recoup in Illinois next Tuesday and in Wisconsin on April 4 . But he will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loyalty of the Democratic professionals after what happened to him in this somewhat atypical state of resorts , pine barrens , retirement towns and big cities . Mr. Wallace won , but he is highly unlikely to , be nomi ? nated . So there was something to win also , for Senators Hubert H. Humphrey of Minnesota and Henry M. Jackson of Washington . Mr. Humphrey will now seek the support of Mr. Muskie 's constituency , with greater prospect of success than Mr. Jackson has . The Washingtonian lacks Mr. Humphrey 's national renown and his ' firm old alliances with politicians in every state . Lindsay a Big Loser Besides Mr. Muskie , the biggest loser here tonight was Mayor Lindsay , whose lavish media campaign  --  and weeks of hard , work brought him only a minute percentage of the vote and only a narrow margin over Senator George of south Dakota , who put relatively few resources into the state . " What disturbs me most , " Mr. Muskie said at his headquarters about three hours after the polls had closed , " is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returns , he said , " reveal to a greater extent  --  thrin I had imagined some of the worst instincts of which human beings are capable . " " George Wallace 's victory is a ' threat to the ? unity of this country , " the Maine Senator said , and he called Mr. Wallace " a demagogue of the worst possible kind . " Mr. Muskie entered the Encore Room of the Dupont Plaza Hotel after a five-piece band had played , " What Goes Up Must Come Down ? " He could not resist a gibe at the press , telling- his supporters : " I won in Iowa , and the press seta I lost . I won in Arizona , and the press said I lost . I won in New Hampshire , and the press said I lost . And now " that I 've lost in Florida , maybe they 'll say I won . " Mr. Jackson read Mr. Walt lace 's triumph differently . He conceded that the Governor had woe . a ' ' ! ratherdist turbing victory . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't moved to the . right " rather , he said , " the great center of the Democratic party is angry that the politicians wo n't face up to the issues  --  law and order and justice , busing , the security of this country . " " The nomination is wide open , " the delighted Mr. Jackson said . " It 's getting down to a race between Humphrey , Jackson and Muskie , and not necessarily in that order . " Mr ; Humphrey , also buoyed by the results , said at the Hotel that his campaign had demonstrated that he had " the knowledge of the issues " and " the vitality needed for the nomination . " " I 'm certainly part of ' the scenario , " the former Vice President said . ' You 'll just.have to include me in . " Mr. Wallace , speaking at an impromptu news conference in Orlando in central Florida , said " the face card in the Democratic deck " had been badly hurt here . " This is a trend from which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Governor , who was tan from a day in the sun atop his hotel . " I 'm surprised at the margin , yes , but I. knew I was winning all along , ' because the real victory was in what I made the other candidates , say . " Mr. Jackson , ' Mr. Humphrey and'Mr . Muskie bent their positions during the campaign in an effort to ' cut into Mr. Wallace 's vote . Mr. Wallace and Mr. Jackson.j -- the two candidates to the right of center here ? polled almost 60 per cent of the total vote , an index of the conservative tide that was running . Florida 's Democratic leaders were dismayed by the results . Gov . Reubin Askew said that the returns  --  particularly in liberal Dade County , where Mr. Wallace did surprisingly well ? suggested that " he may prove to be more than a regional candidate . " Jon Moyle , the State Democratic Chairman , said that he could only hope " Governor Wallace is not playing games with the Democrats of Florida and does not plan to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silent on that point . Neither Mayor Lindsay nor Mr. took much comfort in the outcome . " I think the climate in the country is bad , " said the Mayor , perched on a dresser in his room at the Barcelona Hotel . " The climate is unhealthy , east , west , north and south . " Mr. , who had told friends that lie hoped to run fourth instead of sixth , said that it would be " a minor moral defeat " if returns showing him behind Mr. Lindsay held up . But he returned to an earlier theme , arguing that a strong showing in Florida had never been " crucial to my candidacy . "
