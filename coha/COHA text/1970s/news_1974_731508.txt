txt CHIEF JUDGE Joseph Power of Criminal Court acquired former Park District land at bargain rates as the site for his Bridgeport home , a Tribune investigation has found . The land , at 4228 S. Wallace Av. , was the former site of the Gahan Bathhouse , once operated by Power 's father , It was acquired by Judge Power in April , 1961 , less than a year after a secret land trust bought the property at a bargain rate of $2,100 . Under state law , no municipal officer may have any interest , directly or indirectly , in the purchase of property owned or sold by the city . In 1961 , Power was a city magistrate , and , therefore , a city employe . IN COMPARISON , at the same time the land trust in the now-defunct Live Stock National Bank received the property for $2,100 , the park district sold another bathhouse site about a mile away at 4645 S. Av. for $10,000 , less $2,500 for demolition of the old bathhouse buildings . The Tribune also learned that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and several political friends of Mayor Daley were board members , also benefitted from a series of unusual land deals with the city in the early 1960s . In one case , records show , the Near South Side Development Association was given a block-long vacated stretch of 42d Street between Lowe Avenue and Wallace Street by the City Council so it could build houses . IN T11E CASE of Power 's home , records show that the Chicago Park District decided to sell the Gahan Bathhouse property on Jan. 26. 1960 . On June 16 , 19 ( 0 , the 40-foot by 120-foot lot was sold for $2,100 to Geraldine Kay . listed as a nominee in the transaction . The land was transferred by Geraldine Kay to Trust 14078 in the Live Stock Bank two months later , on Aug. 10. 1960 . Less than a year later , on April 13. 1961 . Judge Power acquired the land , from the trust . The records of the transaction show no federal transfer stamps , indicating that no money eschanged hands . When reached for comment . Judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B. Wheeler , and was told that he traded a lot he owned at the southwest corner of 42d Street and Lowe Avenue in exchange for the bathhouse property . HOWEVER , a check of land tracts by investigators found that the lot at 4200 S. Lowe Av. was transferred in 1959 from a Richard Selle to Land Trust 14036 ill the Live Stock Bank . In 1961 the land was conveyed from the trust to a Lyda Hayes . There is no mention in the land tracts for the Lowe Avenue address in the name of Judge Power or the development company . In the Tribune investigation of the Near South Side Development Association , it was learned that the city gave away , at apparently no cost , a block long stretch of 92d Street near Power 's home to the development association . In yet another land deal involving the development association , it was learned that an approximately four-acre plot of land purchased from the Chicago Housing Authority by a South Side savings iritune t. ' aa Land purchases in Judge Power 's neighborhood-111 40-foot lot purchased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 27 , , foot lot sold to a sausage company for SHUN . I I alley vacated by the City Council ? and III street vacated by the City Council at no cost for . is homes . and loan association was transferred to the development association and then to the land trust in the Live Stock Bank . The land , hounded by 43d Street . Root Street . Wallace Street . and Lowe Avenue , had been acquired by the DIA in 1942 as the site of public housing development . In September , 1953. the District Savings &; Loan Association , 3430 S. Halsted SL , purchased the land for F.455.1110 . Secretary of the savings and loan association was Joseph M. Mozeris , who also was president of the Near South Side . Development Association . The next month , title to the property was conveyed to the development association . Again , records show . no federal transfer stamps were attached , indicating that no money was involved in the transfer . IN MAY , 1959 , title to the property again was transferred , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same trust front which Power acquired his bathhouse property . The latest disclosures of Power 's involvement in the purchase of former city-owned properties follow recent reports that Power was instrumental in starting a deal in which a firm secretly owned by Mayor Daley purchased two lots in 1966 at a scavenger tax sale for only $10 each . The Judicial Inquiry Board has begun an investigation into the activities of Power and his involvement with Eland Realty Co. , the firm reportedly secretly owned by the mayor and his wife .
