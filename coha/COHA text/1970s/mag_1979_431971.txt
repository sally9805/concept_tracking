 | The blue-eyed boy from Cleveland grew up to be a Hollywood superstar . Along the way he did a lot that he 's proud of and a few things he wishes people would forget At age 54 , when most actors start winding down , Paul Newman is going stronger than ever . The years have silvered his hair but they have n't diminished his appeal one bit ? in fact , they have added to it . And his eyes are still blue . Critics , as well as some admirers , have credited his success solely to those piercing cobalt eyes . The statements anger Paul but evidently they worry him enough for him to have wondered , " If my eyes ever turned brown would my career be ended ? " He need n't have asked the question . The Newman appeal is the total man : the son , the brother , the actor , the husband , the father , the activist , the race driver . Paul has been all of these in his life ? a life of triumphs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about his life , he was reluctant . " I 've said it all before , " he told me . " I 'll end up repeating the same old stories ? boring as hell ? or else I have to make up new ones which make me out to be a liar . " But later , he relented . Okay , he 'd talk about his life . How he got where he is ? what he 's proud of , what he 's guilty about . He 's guilty about the divorce from his first wife , Jacqueline Witte , but proud of his successful 21-year second marriage to actress Joanne Woodward .  | He 's proud and guilty about his six children . He 's worked hard to keep them from the life-style that has damaged the lives of other stars ' children ? but he did n't completely succeed . He was shattered last November by the sudden accidental death of his eldest child ? his only son , Scott , 28 . Scott had been under the care of a clinical psychologist because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Valium had been prescribed to calm his nerves and , one night , he took too many of the pills , combining them with alcohol . An associate of the psychologist was in Scott 's Beverly Hills hotel room when he noticed Scott was breathing hard in his sleep . The associate quickly phoned for help but fire department paramedics were unable to revive young Newman .  | Grief-stricken , Paul hurried to California from Kenyon College in Ohio , his alma mater , where he was directing a student play . His sorrow was compounded by the realization that , despite all of his efforts , he had never been able to bring peace to the raging soul of his only son . A longtime friend of Paul 's remembers Scott as a two year old addicted to temper tantrums .

As a boy , Scott spent part of his time with his mother , Jacqueline Witte , part with Paul and Joanne . His presence at the Newman home in Con-  | necticut was sometimes disruptive and during one period of a year he refused to talk to his stepmother . Like many disturbed children , Scott often placed the blame for his troubles on his father . Yet he remarked in a 1976 interview , " Being Paul New man 's son has been a blessing , not because he 's famous , but because he 's a gentle man who always tried hard to understand his kids . He always gave us the benefit of the doubt . He never treated us as children . One of my first memories was when I was five and he came to me and said , Son , I 'm not going to be your father . I 'm going to be your friend . ' " Paul continued that attitude after Scott had grown up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of becoming a performer . Scott played a small role and did stunt work in The  | Towering Inferno , among other films . But he remained a troubled young man and his bent for destructiveness seemed epitomized by his hobby of skydiving . He seemed to court a violent death , but he died quietly , in a different kind of accident . Paul is recovering slowly from the tragedy . It has been the hardest blow in his second marriage that has withstood 21 years of the kinds of pressure that could upset the strongest of unions . " Paul and I get along so well because we have nothing in common , " Joanne explained . This seems true . " They are totally different , even in their approaches to acting , " says their friend , writer Gore Vidal . " Paul worries about his performance ; Joanne refuses to prepare . " Paul 's avocation is auto racing ; Joanne 's is ballet .  | Paul was delighted when Joanne attended one of his auto races in Riverside , Calif. , though he conceded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ producer John Foreman , who has known them both since the day the Newmans met : " Joanne is mercurial , quixotic . She speaks her mind , no matter how blunt her remarks might be . Paul is more closed in , quiet , more controlled . " Paul Newman would be the first to agree that he is all those things , for Paul is exactly like his father ... . A rthur Newman was one of seven children born in Cleveland to a German-Jewish family . He was 11 when his father died and he had to help support the family . He put out his own neighborhood newspaper at 15 . Two years later he was hired as a reporter for a Cleveland daily . His brother , Joseph , was also a newspaperman and charged with the same driving ambition . Communication by radio waves was becoming a fad in 1915 and the Newman brothers founded Cleveland 's first radio store ? The Newman-Stern Company . ( Stern , a silent partner , soon left the firm but his name remained . ) When private radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branched into sporting goods . Joseph ran the business while Arthur served in the Army . The postwar years brought prosperity to Newman-Stern , which advertised itself as " Cleveland 's biggest sporting goods and oldest radio store . " Arthur married lovely Theresa Fetzer , who had immigrated from Hungary at the age of four . Their first child , a son , Arthur , Jr. , was born January 24 , 1924 . Their second , another son , Paul Leonard , was born on January 26 , 1925 . The following year Arthur Newman bought an 11-room house at 298 ? Brighton Road in Shaker Heights . Paul observes : " Shaker Heights is one of the three most affluent communities in the United States , along with Beverly Hills , Calif .. and Grosse Pointe , Mich . It had the best educational system in the country and my one great regret is that I did n't take better advantage of it . " As a boy Paul was less interested in books than sports . Wiry and swift , he played all the games and adopted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crew haircut . " I 'm convinced that is what saved my hair , " he says today . " My father , my uncle and my brother became bald . I would have , too , except that I kept the short Germanic haircut and , from the time I was 11 to my midtwenties , I brushed my hair everyday with a stiff brush - Paul remembers his father as " a very shy , very uncommunicative man , and one of the best-read persons I 've ever known . " Paul 's brother recalls that their father made up for his lack of college by reading the encyclopedia from one end to the other , then starting over again . " Dad was undemonstrative , not uncommunicative says Arthur Newman , Jr " Like Paul , he was quiet and had a rich sense of humor .

He quit at 11 , and that was his last brush with organized religion ( although his children attended Presbyterian and Episcopal Sunday schools ) . Mrs. Newman had entertained ambitions of becoming an actress and she became active in the Cleveland Playhouse . She enrolled Paul in the children 's group , The Curtain Raisers , for which he made his acting debut at 10 in the role of St. George . Like all businessmen , Paul 's father  | was hit hard by the Depression . " I never came home and found there was no food on the table , " says Paul , " but we felt the pinch . Sporting goods are a luxury and the business always suffers in a depression . Eighty-five percent of the sportinggoods stores went broke in the 1930s . My father survived because he had an impeccable reputation . When business was at its worst , he went to Chicago and convinced Spaulding and Wilson to give him $150,000 worth of goods on consignment . They would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the junior-high-school football squad but , at five feet , two inches , he was too small to make the team at Shaker Heights High School . So he drifted into dramatics . He was already strikingly handsome . He had a winning manner , persuasive smile and flashing blue eyes . His mother once remarked , " In a way , it 's a shame to waste such beauty on a boy . " In January 1943 , Paul graduated from high school and enrolled at Kenyon College in nearby Gambier , Ohio , majoring in economics . It was a small , allmale school ? " I figured I 'd study better without girls around . " But he was bored by economics and eager to join the service , as had his brother Arthur . Paul enlisted in the V-12 program for Navy pilots and was assigned to Yale University . The Navy discovered that those intensely blue eyes were color-blind and hence unfit for piloting . Thus , radioman third-class Newman served out the war on uneventful patrols aboard torpedo planes over the South Pacific . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Navy , he grew nine inches . Back at college he became a defensive linebacker on the Kenyon football team . At 152 pounds , he took a pounding , but he enjoyed it . He also liked the campus life , which included brawls in local saloons with the town toughs . One brawl landed him in jail . The Cleveland Plain Dealer bannered the news : KENYON COLLEGE IN TROUBLE AGAIN . Paul 's parents were appalled to learn that their son was among the six football players jailed after a ruckus with Gambier youths as the result of the athletes ' favorite off-campus sport : making advances toward a local boy 's date . On this occasion , a fistfight broke out and the tavern owner called the police . Four of the students involved were dismissed from Kenyon ; Paul and one other were placed on probation and kicked off the team . Actually , for Paul , the incident proved lucky . " It was simply because I could n't play football anymore and I did n't want to study that I went back into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graduation . I have the funny feeling that if I had never been thrown in the clink I would have stayed an economics major and today I would be in the sportinggoods business in Cleveland , Ohio . " Graduating from Kenyon in 1949 , Paul started working at Newman-Stern , then took a job acting in a summer theater at Williams Bay , Wis . He was stimulated by the challenge of playing a different role each week before paying customers . He also encountered his first real romance . ( He 'd had a brief fling while he was in the Navy that ended when the girl sent him a " Dear John " letter . ) In Wisconsin , he met Jacqueline Witte , a tall , brown-eyed blonde who had studied acting at nearby Lawrence College and had joined the Williams Bay company . She and Paul were married in December 1949 and he found a job in a winter-stock company in Woodstock , Ill. , working as a farmhand to augment his small salary . Their first child , Scott , was born in 1950 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Paul returned to Cleveland to help his uncle and brother run the sporting-goods store . " I know there must be a great romance to retailing , " Paul remarks , " but somehow its allure eluded me . " After he had been with the store a year , Joe Newman sold it and Paul was relieved of the obligation to the family enterprise . The new owners asked Paul to manage a golf driving range . He spent the summer days at the range and at night he read commercials and the weather on a Cleveland television station . Then , with seven months remaining on his GI educational benefits and $2,000 in the bank , he made a momentous decision ? he was going to enroll at the Yale University Drama School . He moved Jackie and their infant son Scott to a tiny apartment in New Haven , Conn. , where he enrolled in Yale as a directing major , intending to teach drama at a college . To help pay for his studies , he sold encyclopedias from door to door and Jackie commuted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his second semester at Yale , Paul played Beethoven 's nephew in a student play . An agent , MCA 's Audrey Wood , was impressed with young Newman . " If you come to New York , look me up , " she told him . His money running out , Paul decided to seek summer work in New York . John Foreman , then a new employee at MCA and later Paul 's movie producer , recalls the day Newman arrived at the agency . " He looked like a Greek god , " says Foreman . " I sent him over to read for a part in a television series , The Web , and he got the part . Paul was cast for nearly every part he tried out for . " A semi-regular role in The Aldrich Family TV series assured Paul of $200 a month so he left Yale , moving Jackie and Scott into a furnished apartment on Staten Island . Jackie 's sister lived there and she baby-sat while the Newmans sought work in Manhattan . Paul looks back on his days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Television was the best thrill in town , a totally new experience , " he says . " The kitchen drama ' of television was vibrant and relatively unspoiled . I was able to play all kinds of roles . I had n't been categorized  | yet . " Next , Paul joined the Actors Studio , an event he considers pivotal in his career . He had not even applied . He had merely agreed to do an audition scene with an actress friend who was among 500 seeking admission to the studio . Paul Newman was one of four chosen . He spent his days racing from one casting office to another , wearing his one and only suit . " The guy in the white seersucker is here again , " receptionists would announce . During one of his rounds on a hot August afternoon he met another acting hopeful , Joanne Woodward . She hated him on sight because , though she was dying from the heat , he looked , she says , " as cool as a shirt ad . But he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking to himself , " What a pretty girl . " Joanne Woodward had been born on February 27 , 1930 , in Thomasville , Ga . She 'd studied drama for a year at Louisiana State University and then went to New York where she enrolled in the Neighborhood Playhouse . Finally , in 1952 , she was hired as understudy to both female leads in Broadway 's Picnic . Paul had also been cast in Picnic , as the secondary male lead . It was a lucky job for him . His savings had dwindled to $250 and Jackie was pregnant with their second child , Susan . It was inevitable that Joanne and Paul see each other backstage at the theater . In spite of themselves , they were drawn to each other . One Saturday morning , John Foreman received an excited phone call from Paul . He and Joanne were going to play the lead roles in Picnic at that afternoon 's matinee . Foreman , eager to see them , hurried to the theater . He saw the best performance of Picnic out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Paul were in love . But Paul was very married and there seemed no possibility whatsoever that their feelings for each other would ever amount to anything . Fourteen months after Picnic opened , Paul accepted a $1,000-a-week movie contract with Warner Brothers . He sent Jackie and the two children ( Susan was born in 1953 ) back to Wisconsin and he headed for Hollywood with high expectations . He was horrified when , for his screen debut , he was cast as Basil , the Greek slave silversmith , in a corny epic called The Silver Chalice . Paul still refers to it as " the worst movie filmed during the 1950s . " When The Silver Chalice eventually appeared on television , he took out newspaper ads to apologize for it . ( So upset was he over The Silver Chalice that years later he declined the leading role in Ben Hur , saying , " I wore a cocktail dress once . Never again ! " Ben Hur made millions and won an Academy Award for Charlton Heston . ) As soon as The Silver Chalice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theater to redeem his career and his self-respect . Both were restored in The Desperate Hours , in which he played a hoodlum holding a family hostage in their own home . Meantime , Joanne was signed to a contract at Twentieth Century-Fox . The studio could n't quite figure out what to do with the bright Southern girl who did n't fit the glamour role , so she was loaned out for a couple of minor films . Then , because Judy Garland , Carroll Baker and other actresses turned down the role , Joanne was cast as a schizophrenic in a low-budget film , The Three Faces of Eve . The Newman luck surfaced in his third film . James Dean , his fellow student at the Actors Studio , had been selected to portray prizefighter Rocky Graziano in Somebody Up There Likes Me . Then Dean was killed in a 1955 highway crash and Paul Newman was cast as Graziano ? the role that established him as a bright new star . Though their film careers were ascending , the personal lives of Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resist her attraction to a married man . But whenever she ran into Paul in New York or Hollywood , she realized the depth of her feeling for him . In defense , she became more or  | less engaged three times to other men ? and broke it off each time . Paul himself was overwhelmed by guilt over his feelings for Joanne . He sought refuge in beer . On a summer night in 1956 , he was arrested in Mineola , Long Island , after he had allegedly driven his car through a red light , knocked over shrubs and a fire hydrant and left the scene of the accident . Police officers claimed that Paul resisted arrest and he was brought to headquarters in handcuffs . News photos showed him in an angry pose , flanked by policemen . The incident was chastening for Paul and it provided the only tinge of scandal in his career . By now , there seemed to be no hope of salvaging his marriage to Jackie , even though they had had a third child , Stephanie , born in 1954 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a divorce . She refused to give him one . By 1957 Paul and Jackie were living apart and he made no secret of his attachment to Joanne . She , Paul and Gore Vidal established a rollicking menage a trois in a rented Malibu house . " It was a marvelous time , " Vidal remembers . " Like a delayed adolescence for Paul and me . " Joanne enjoyed the antics up to a point . Then one day she suddenly shouted , " Why should I do all the housework around here ? " Adolescence was finally over . After Joanne and Paul appeared on screen together in The Long Hot Summer , Jackie Newman finally agreed to let Paul go . He got a divorce in Mexico , then flew back to Las Vegas to marry Joanne . The wedding took place on January 29 , 1958 , in an uncharacteristic place ? Las Vegas ' gaudy Strip . They said their vows before a local judge at El Rancho Vegas with Sophie Tucker , Joe E. Lewis , Eydie Gorme and other casino stars attending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the emcee introduced the newlyweds as " Bob Newman and Joan Woodbury . " The Newmans honeymooned in Europe , returning for Joanne 's surprise Oscar as best actress of 1957 for her performance in The Three Faces of Eve . She accepted the award in a homemade gown , infuriating Joan Crawford . Joanne Woodward has set Hollywood glamour back 25 years , " trumpeted the star for whom , ironically , Joanne had been named . From the very beginning of the marriage , Joanne declared , " I will not let a career separate me from Paul . " When he went to Israel to film Exodus , she accompanied him , along with their infant daughter Elinor Theresa ( Nell ) , born on April 8 , 1959 . Most of Joanne 's films in their first decade of marriage were with Paul . She also played part-time mother to his three children from his first marriage ? not an easy role for any woman . While Paul 's film career soared , Joanne maintained her resolve not to be separated from her family . She gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on April 21 , 1965 . " Joanne really gave up her career for me , to help raise my children , to stick by me and make the marriage work , " Paul has admitted . For that reason he gave her a gift of love ? the film Rachel , Rachel . Paul devoted 10 months to preparing , directing and then editing Rachel , Rachel , the story of a 36-year-old spinster 's awakening to love and life . Because the big studios declined such a small , sensitive theme , the Newmans invested their own money to start the project , transforming their Manhattan apartment into a production office . Warner Brothers finally agreed to provide the $700,000 filming cost . Both Paul and Joanne worked without pay on their labor of love . When I visited the Rachel , Rachel company in Danbury , Conn. , in October 1967 , Paul was directing a bedroom scene between his wife and actor James Olson . The set had been constructed inside a high school gymnasium . With a fried chicken wing in one hand and a beer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enterprise was chancy . " But you 've got to take chances now and then to do what you believe in . I wo n't do a picture just to keep the money rolling in . I wo n't make one of those superepics . I did it once ? The Silver Chalice ? and once is enough . " Rachel , Rachel proved a success with critics , but not with audiences who seemed to prefer the super-epics that Paul scorned . The film won the New York Film Critics Awards for Joanne as actress and Paul as director . The picture was nominated for an Academy Award , as were Joanne , supporting actress Estelle Parsons and writer Stewart Stern . But the Academy voters failed to nominate the man who directed Rachel , Rachel . Paul Newman has been nominated for the best-actor Oscar four times ? for Cat on a Hot Tin Roof , The Hustler , Hud and Cool Hand Luke . He has yet to win . The Hollywood Establishment has never felt comfortable with Paul Newman . He seemed to challenge the system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hated his servitude to Warner Brothers that he bought out his contract for a half-million dollars . He refused to settle into the sybaritic Hollywood life , preferring the chilly Connecticut winters . Except when he and Joanne were in California on film assignments , they resided in Darien and later in Westport , raising their children away from the spotlight . Daughter Susan said in an interview , " Dad was always aware of the destructive power of an inflated ego . He always knew how easy it was , especially in Hollywood , to start believing in yourself too much . He used to say that , whenever a person became famous , he had the responsibility to remain humble . "  | Newman 's film portrayals also disturbed the Establishment . He shunned the traditional hero roles that stars like Gary Cooper , James Stewart and John Wayne played for characters who were enormously attractive yet who possessed a single , often fatal flaw . The characters proved right for the times . They appealed to a generation of moviegoers shocked by assassinations and betrayed by false leaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cynicism of the antiheroes he portrayed . Instead , he plunged into the political crusades of the 1960s . That was also cause for the film community to distrust him . " After Jack ( Kennedy ) was elected President , Paul became more active politically , as did many actors , " says Gore Vidal . " He had a chance to run for senator from Connecticut and I urged him to do so . He declined , probably for financial reasons ? he was supporting 40 people at the time . I 'm sorry he did n't run . He is one of the few people I know who has good character . That is rare in politics and just as rare in show business . " Paul now says he would never run for elective office and his friends believe him . He has no taste for the glad-handing that candidates must endure . Newman took part in the 1963 March on Washington and appeared in Gadsden , Ala. , with Marlon Brando , Anthony Franciosa and others in an effort to promote racial harmony . In 1968 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democratic National Convention in Chicago . Last year when he was a delegate to a United Nations Disarmament Conference , he and other appointees appeared at the White House to confer with President Carter . Secretaries poured out of all the offices to get a look at Paul Newman . And at the State Department , the crowd was so large that he had to leave by a rear exit . He attended five weeks of all-day sessions at the UN Disarmament Conference . Another of his causes is population control ? " Though I 'm a fine one to talk on that subject , having sired six children ! " he admits . Among Paul 's other involvements have been Business Executives Against the Vietnam War , organized by his friend Harold Willens , and the Energy Action Committee , an activist group aimed at lessening American dependence on the seven oil giants . Newman 's championing of unpopular causes inevitably brings a flood of hate mail which he studiously ignores . Recently he mused over his liberalism , observing that his father may have had an influence . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I know he was a liberal , perhaps even a socialist . My one great regret is that he did n't live to see his son named number 19 on the White House Enemies List of Richard Nixon . My dad would have been puffed up over that ! " I often wondered how I could have earned such a lofty position . I think I know the answer . In 1968 , I was editing Rachel , Rachel during the week and campaigning for presidential candidate ( Eugene ) McCarthy in New Hampshire on the weekends . A Jaguar dealer kindly loaned me a car to use every Friday , Saturday and Sunday . I learned that Nixon was using the same car on Tuesdays and Wednesdays , so I left a note in it . It read : Dear Mr. Nixon , You should have no trouble driving this car . It has a tricky clutch . Paul Newman . ' " Throughout his campaigning , Paul retains his sense of proportion and humor . In a studio commissary one day , he passed the table of John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hey Paul , " Wayne greeted him . " How 's the revolution coming ? " Newman replied , " How can we possibly win , Duke . with you on the other side ? "  | Paul Newman has appeared in only 11 films in the past decade . Some have been failures , but three have been among the 15 biggest moneymakers in film history : Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid , The Sting ( both with Robert Redford ) and The Towering Inferno . All have been projects that Newman intensely believed in . Cassidy/Sundance was originally planned for Paul and Steve McQueen but that did n't work out . " I think Joanne was the first one to suggest Redford for the part , " Paul said . He considered Cassidy/Sundance a winner from the start and recalls the first day of filming : " I was sitting next to Redford and I slapped him on the knee . Well , kid , ' I said , how does it feel to be in your first 40-million grosser ? ' He must have thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul 's estimate on what the film would earn proved to be conservative . The 1969 Western made twice $40 million and that figure was exceeded by The Sting 's profits in 1973 . Redford had agreed to play the lead in The Sting and , though Paul admired the script , he thought the other role seemed too secondary for him . " But George Roy Hill called me at my New York apartment and asked if he and Redford could come over to discuss casting the other role , " said Paul . " We had some drinks and talked for an hour , then I walked them to the elevator . As we were waiting for it to arrive , George suddenly said , ' We think you ought to do it . ' 1 said , Okay , I will . ' I sometimes wonder what would have happened if the elevator had been waiting for them . " From co-starring together , Paul and Redford developed a friendship . Paul does n't have many friends . When he was appointed to the UN Disarmament Conference , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 25 close friends . The agents soon discovered that Paul Newman does n't have 25 close friends . Paul concedes that he and Redford are " pretty good friends " now . Their relationship is based on horseplay and elaborate practical jokes . Such as the time Redford gave Paul a red Porsche for his birthday . The car was ancient , could n't run and had been bashed up in an accident . Paul , in retaliation , quickly had the Porsche compacted and sneaked it into Redford 's house in the middle of the sight . Then he sat back to wait for the eaction ? but there was none . Redford never indicated that he 'd even seen the ear so Paul had to get to work to think ap another joke . Oddly , Newman 's favorite film at the moment is Slap Shot , a raunchy comedy about a small-time ice-hockey team . He explains , " It has a certain locker-room purity about it and I believe that anything that is funny can transcend vulgarity or even irreverence . But it certainly did offend a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman who owns a race track in Indiana .

' " One of his favorite stories that deflates the Newman image ( his favorite kind of story ) happened when he attended a preview of Slap Shot in New Haven . A scene in the ice-hockey film called for Paul to appear in his underwear as he opened his apartment door to admit a woman . Paul had the wardrobe department get him the widest cut of boxer shorts available , reasoning that the comedy would be heightened by the sight of his slender legs . " When the scene came on at the preview , " he recalls , " a woman three rows in front of me said loudly enough for everyone to hear , You mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he considers Slap Shot his favorite seems to be that it proved he could play comedy .

He does not tell jokes , but he has a ribald way of viewing the world and himself . The Newman humor is lusty and collegiate . He delights in practical jokes ? the more intricate the better . Once , when he caught a 280-pound marlin , he had himself photographed beside it ? hanging from his heels . Another time , he was filming a movie scene in which he was to drive a car up an alley and out of sight . He did ? but then came a loud crash . The director , terrified , hurried up the alley to find Newman convulsed . He had persuaded propmen to topple a line of trash cans when the car disappeared , creating the noise of a crash .

Arthur , who is completely bald , wore an ancient leather hat throughout the filming of The Drowning Pool . Paul said to his favorite stuntman , Stan Barrett , " We got ta do something about Arthur 's hat . I ca n't stand it anymore . " Together they devised a plot . As soon as lunch was over , Paul announced , " Arthur , by unanimous vote we have decided that your hat must go ! " Paul grabbed the hat and threw it into the air . Barrett , standing behind a tree , riddled it with three shotgun blasts . Arthur had the last word , though . He continued wearing the tattered cap until the end of filming .

" He is less polite about fans who explode the flashbulbs of their cameras in his face . Not only does he dislike the intrusion , the flashes hurt his sensitive eyes . Paul 's big off-screen passion is auto racing . He raced recently at Daytona , Fla. , and plans to drive his Ferrari and Datsun in competition at Riverside , Calif. , and Atlanta , Ga .

Then I slammed against a wall and pretzeled the car . " Another time , he was riding with another driver on a dirt track near New Orleans when their car hit a rut and went flying . " Neither of us had a seat belt and for a time we rode on two wheels . Then the car went on its side but we were n't thrown out . The windshield shattered . Fortunately it was European glass that breaks into powder on impact . We climbed out of the windshield Neither of us was hurt . We hardly had our hair mussed . As I stood by the car , somebody slammed the door on my hand . Fortunately the door was sprung or I would have lost the tips of my fingers . Open the door , ' I said quietly . When they did , I ran to the beer cooler and stuck my fingers in the icy water . I did n't even lose my fingernails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says , especially when he repays her by attending the ballet . Despite Paul and Joanne admittedly having little in common , they do have a genuine admiration for each other . When Joanne appeared on The Dick Cavett Show , Cavett ran film clips of the Newman 's daughter , Nell , who portrayed Rachel as a child in the movie Rachel , Rachel . He hesitantly suggested that Nell was more beautiful than her mother . Joanne 's reply was matter-of-fact , " Well , it 's no surprise . My father was n't Paul Newman . " While she has made two films under his direction , Joanne refuses to be dominated by Paul at home . A friend recalls that when Paul returned from an arduous film location and started complaining crankily that dinner was n't on time and his laundry was n't even done , Joanne was sympathetic up to a point . But then she cracked down . " You have no rights here , " she told her husband . " You ca n't come home after two months away and start ordering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and take care of your responsibilities ? then you will have rights . " It was an error Paul did not repeat . Willow Springs International Raceway is a curving ribbon of concrete set down on the edge of the Mojave desert . When Paul and I reached there , the Ferrari had not arrived . Paul was obviously displeased but he made no complaint . ( " When Paul is angry , he is very quiet , " his brother Arthur had told me . ) Finally the truck carrying the Ferrari arrived ? the garage in Beverly Hills had been locked , causing the unexpected delay . Preparing for the drive , Paul stripped down to his shorts . Despite all the beer he is reputed to drink , his belly was flat as a boy 's . He maintains his physical trim with the zeal of an Olympic contender . He eats sparingly , avoiding red meat , and he drinks only beer and wine . His prodigious consumption of beer ? as much as a case daily ? astounds admirers of his slim form . " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one thing , he sweats profusely . Says an intimate , " Fortunately for Paul 's profession as an actor , his face does n't perspire . But when you see him looking so cool he may be standing in a pool of sweat . " Paul also avoids weight beer can add to the midsection by dedicated exercise . He does sit-ups , leg-ups , swims 45 minutes at a time and runs three miles every morning , covering a mile in eight minutes . He 's also addicted to the sauna . Donning his racing clothes , first he pulled a soccer T-shirt over his muscular chest . Then a suit that resembled long woolen underwear . The cloth was flameresistant , as were the other garments ? gold racing suit with blue stripes , heavy boots , long gloves . Finally he donned the helmet , last protection against the race driver 's greatest enemy ? fire . On the shiny surface  | was printed the essential information in case of a crash : P.L.

He had a few words with his racing enterprise manager , Ray Ramsey , who had arrived by private plane an hour earlier . Newman nodded agreement to Ramsey 's instructions and switched on the car 's motor . It hesitated , rumbled , then roared explosively . As the handful of onlookers held their ears , Newman guided the Ferrari through the gate and onto the raceway . He revved the motor a few more times , then thundered toward the first turn . For two hours he steered the sleek racer around the tortuous 2 ? - mile circuit of the Willow Springs track . When he piloted the race car back to the garage , his face glowed with high excitement . He called for his first beer of the day , lighted the first of the three cigarettes he allows himself daily and dictated to Ramsey the changes that were needed to prepare the Ferrari for competition . Newman 's exhilaration continued through the 90-minute drive back to Los Angeles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago , " he said earnestly , " I could have been national champion by the age of 51 . " It was a curious remark . Here he was rhapsodizing about auto racing yet he had only the most perfunctory of comments about the profession that had made him a millionaire many times over . " I think Paul is bored with acting , " director George Roy Hill had told me . " It 's too bad . He has the capacity to become a great actor . When he 's hitting on all 12 cylinders , he is a joy to watch . He 'll never be as great a race driver as he could be an actor . But being a celebrity is a process of dying and that has been the hardest thing for Paul to cope with . " Paul put it another way . " How can you have respect for a profession in which the biggest stars of the year were a robot and a shark ? Besides , " he went on , " American audiences wo n't allow an actor to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to succeed I must continue repeating myself . I 'm not allowed to get out of my own skin . " Back in Hollywood , at the corner of Sunset and Sepulveda , a girl was selling flowers . Paul lowered the window , surveyed the bouquets and asked , " How much are they ? " She replied that the big bunches were $5 , the smaller ones $3 . Paul looked a while longer , then chose the smaller ones ? two of them ? because they were " prettier . " Without my asking he volunteered , " I 'm meeting Joanne at the airport tonight and I always like to have something for her . Once I greeted her with a whole band . "
