txt The prospect of synthetic fuels is alluring : all the oil and gas the nation needs for centuries , secure from foreign interference . But the potential costs of a rush to develop " synfuels " ? the capital wasted on inefficient technology , the damage to the environment ? are so great that caution is warranted . That is why the Senate Banking Committee now wants a program of Government-assisted demonstration projects before committing the country to a major production effort . Such prudence deserves support . ? The initial push for a synthetic fuels program came from the House last June . Legislators on their way home for the July Fourth recess were eager to show voters that something ? anything ? was being done about the gasoline shortage . The result was a lopsided 368-to-25 vote authorizing $3 billion in subsidies for synthetic fuels . President Carter then jumped ahead of what he thought was an unstoppable bandwagon . He asked Congress for a gigantic $88-billion , 10-year effort to produce the equivalent of 2.5 million barrels of oil each day , enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Senate Energy Committee 's response , coming after the gasoline lines had disappeared , was less than the President asked for . It provided for only $20 billion , to achieve a target of 1.5 million barrels a day . But this plan remained in spirit a crash program , including creation of an Energy Security Corporation with the power to press ahead with commercial development of synfuels . The Banking Committee , which shares jursidiction for synfuel financing , has been more cautious . At the urging of environmentalists and private business groups , it approved only $3 billion to produce at most 600,000 barrels a day to demonstrate a broad range of technologies . Government would be limited to providing purchase and loan guarantees to private firms ; no independent Energy Security Corporation would be established . The Senate , which must now choose between these approaches , would be wise to take the Banking Committee 's route . The basic technology for synthesizing oil and gas from coal is 40 years old . But no one has ever tried to use it on the scale needed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is hard to predict which technologies will be the cheapest or which will be compatible with worker safety and a clean environment . In committing the country to production on a commercial scale , Congress could endow us with a white elephant with alarmingly dirty habits . The Banking Committee 's approach need not delay creation of an efficient synfuel industry . It , too , calls for timely development of demonstration plants . But it would require the President to come back to Congress for approval of any big program costing tens of billions . If the development program is successful , additional funding should be no serious problem for a fuelhungry America . If it is n't , why make it easy to throw good dollars after bad ? Synfuels may or may not be the best way to power our cars and heat our houses in the 1990 's . We wo n't know until we try . But , as the Banking Committee suggests , we can try most economically by taking one step at a time .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
