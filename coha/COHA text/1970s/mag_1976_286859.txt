This cotton-picker name of Red Vine from the Dirty Side was rolling a pregnant skate through Watergate town other day when he passed the home twenty of lady breaker First Mama . There was no city kitty so , mercysakes , Red hammered off , keyed his rig and called " Breaker one-niner for KUY-9532 . " Negative copy . That foxy lady wasn ' t hanging out , didn ' t have her ears on . Good buddy told her anyway , " You truck ' em easy now , Apple Betty . Eighty-eights and ten , roger and out . " <P> <P> To the owners of 15 million Citizens Band radio sets , and some of the millions more who have become familiar with CB language from records and TV shows , the message was loud and clear : a nontrucker from New York City , whose CB nickname is Red Vine , was driving his Volkswagen through Washington when he passed the White House , home of fellow CB-Owner Betty Ford , whose radionym is First Mama ( TIME , May 3 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tried to reach her on his set , using her FCC-issued call number , but got no response .
