Artillery bombarded Phnom-Penh last week , inflicting the most serious damage on the capital in nearly four years of war . Taking advantage of the dry season , Khmer Rouge insurgents moved their forces to within 4 miles of the city and shelled it over a period of five days with captured U.S.-made 105-mm. howitzers . During the attacks , at least 1,200 of the 25-lb. shells rained upon the refugee-packed capital , demolishing flimsy makeshift huts and killing more than 100 civilians . <P> The howitzer bombardment followed five weeks of almost daily shellings by Soviet-made 122-mm. rockets - less powerful than the howitzer rounds but still terrifying because they fall randomly . After one rocket crashed into the courtyard of the Lyce Descartes , which was luckily empty of children at the time , the Lon Nol regime closed all schools and imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew . <P> With artillery and rocket attacks now almost daily occurrences , foreigners have begun to flee the city . British and Australian dependents have already departed . A gathering of French residents at their embassy 's cultural center ended in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rumors that the insurgents had begun infiltrating the capital swept through the city 's crowded slums , terrifying the populace . <P> The government has responded to the shellings by rushing a 1,400-man task force , backed by 25 armored personnel carriers , to the area southwest of the capital where they suspect the insurgents have stationed their artillery . The task force failed to find the howitzers . Military observers believe that the insurgents are merely lying low , waiting for the government forces to withdraw before resuming the attacks . Said a Western military expert : " Neither side is strong enough to win , or weak enough to lose . " A sure loser , however , will be once graceful and tranquil Phnom-Penh . With seven months remaining in the dry season , the capital faces a long , painful siege .
