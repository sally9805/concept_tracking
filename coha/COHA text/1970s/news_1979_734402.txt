txt The 7 A.M. commuter bus from Nanuet , N.Y. , to New York City is one of those businessmen 's specials that often seem to carry more briefcases and topcoats than passengers . Yesterday it carried Sally , Alex and Stephanie Caiti as well , bound not for the office , but for what they saw as a date with a bit of history . They were a mother and her two children , Roman Catholics from Nyack , driving to the park-and-ride lot , taking the bus to the Port Authority , walking across town , and standing for long morning hours on First Avenue , squashed and shoved by people from all areas and all religions , in the hope of catching one glimpse of Pope John Paul II . Around the city , there were thousands like them doing the same . They arrived at Penn Station and Grand Central , emerged from subway exits and crosstown buses , drove or were driven into New York , drawn by the possibility of a short look at the man who is the leader of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-Catholics as well . As the Caitis walked toward the United Nations , others were moving in the same direction or making plans to stop and watch at some other spot on the Pontiff 's route . Of all races , ages , and beliefs , they stood behind police barriers throughout the city yesterday cheering John Paul II and wishing him long life in their native tongue . Yet they all shared one thing : a tangible electricity , like a common intake of breath , an excitement that saw them standing for hours to watch and wait , braving the rain , and traveling from all over the area for just one face-to-face moment with the Pope . " This makes him seem less aloof , off of his pedestal , " Mrs. Caiti said as Alex , 11 years old , and Stephanie , 9 , leaned against the gray police barriers across from the United Nations . " But at the same time to see a man who is a leader of the people , a leader of the Catholic Church ? it 's the same way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more so . " It 's worth it for the children to take the day off from school , to see this now rather than read about it in books 10 years from now . It 's just a really excitWithWith this in their minds ? and some characteristic impatience on the part of the children ? the Caitis waited near the corner of 45th Street for two hours to glimpse the man they all agree is their spiritual leader and to report back to their husband and father , Alfredo ? who was unable to join them because of his auto business ? on how the Pope looked . When they had started out for the city it had been dark outside , the street lights still on . A note had been left for the school bus that said simply , " Not Today . " Buttons and Banners In the midtown Port Authority Bus Terminal , Mrs. Calti bought film for her pocket camera . She and her two children , in jeans and shirts and comfortable shoes , looked like people on their way to a football @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few people and then by a crowd heading in the same direction . And across from the flags of the United Nations at 8 A.M. , they were again at first only part of a small crowd eddying around them with John Paul buttons and banners and T-shirts and religious medals . " Mom , look at all the people up there , " Stephanie said , pointing toward the roofs of surrounding buildings , where security personnel were small black figures against an overcast sky . " Are they watching the Pope ? " " They ca n't take any chances anymore , " her mother said , " Not since President Kennedy was shot . " Mrs. Caiti lived in Washington then . She lived in New York in 1985 when Paul VI became the first Pope to visit America . She and her children watched on television last year when John Paul II was made Pope , and she and her husband , who was born in Italy , have visited the Vatican . She has taught about the Pope in the religious classes she gives for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the raffle of tickets for the Yankee Stadium mass at St. Ann 's Church , where Stephanie goes to parochial school , she decided that they were going to see the Pope nonetheless , at either St. Patrick 's Cathedral or the United Nations . " How will I know he 's corning ? " asked Alex , as 9 A.M. approached . " You 'll hear a big noise , " Mrs. Caiti said . " Everyone will start cheering . " The crowd had grown in an hour . The Caiti family was enveloped by the children of Holy Cross School , on 43d Street near Ninth Avenue , all in their uniform brown and yellow plaid . Mrs. Caiti ar- ' ranged some of them so that the smallest were in front , and she used her map to show a small boy the route the Pope was taking from La Guardia Airport . A woman standing nearby with a transistor-radio earphone plugged in above a large costume earring said loudly : " He 's on his way . He 's over the bridge . " Stephanie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but there was nothing yet except the rows and rows of police officers . A doctor behind her said , " No sign of him . " " I wonder how he feels seeing everyone screaming and waving ? " Mrs. Caiti wondered aloud . Alex said , " It must be nice to be so PoPular . " Then suddenly there was a rush of noise from the blocks farther north , and a line of motorcycle police officers , and a jumble of flatbed trucks ca photographers , and the whole crow Mrs. Caiti and Stephanie and Alex at the front , strained forward and seemed to be holding their breaths . ' Fantastic , You Can See Him ' " Oh ... oh ... he 's in an open car , " Mrs. Caiti said , her voice high . " Oh , fantastic , fantastic , you can see him . " " I can see him , " Stephanie said , clapping her hands in the air . " Look . " Just a few yards outside of the police barrier , in the back of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was the Pope , white hair , white skin , waving . Then , as swift as the " Amen " that one nun in the crowd said softly , it was over ? the moment , the man , both gone . Everyone seemed to exhale and move back . The nuns began to gather together the children from Holy Cross . The police began to talk and joke again . People began to move off on to the side streets , and Mrs. Caiti turned to her children , smiling . " He looked great , " Mrs. Caiti said . " He looked Polish . " " I saw him , " Alex said . " I saw the Pope . " " That was the best ever , " Mrs. Caiti said , " was n't it ? " Stephanie nodded . Alex nodded . " You 'll always remember that you were here today , " their mother said . " You 'll always remember that you saw him . " Mrs. Caiti put her camera in her purse , and they joined the crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
