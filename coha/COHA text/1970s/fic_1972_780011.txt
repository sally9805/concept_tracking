 | " How about Mitchison ? " Barchet glared suddenly at Harker . Raymond , frowning , said , " Why Mitchison ? " " I wonder if he 's really necessary . Frankly , I 'd like to bounce him . He does n't seem much for subtlety and he 's awfully eager to get this operation splashed through the media , whether or not we 're ready for it . If it 's okay with you , I 'd like to bring in a couple of the boys who handled my gubernatorial campaign . Not only is their judgment excellent , but ? " " It seems to me , " Barchet interrupted icily , " that we have more than enough people of radical political affiliation working for us already . I doubt that anyone who handled a Nat-Lib campaign would be an asset to our program . " Harker goggled . " You can say a thing like that to me ? I was a Nat-Lib Governor , for Christ 's sake ! You hired me , and you think that two press agents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Barchet said . " You were hired over my definite and strongly voiced objections , Mr. Harker . Your party happens to be the one currently in power , but it definitely does not represent the main ideological current of American enterprise . And if we succeed in our aims , I like to think it will be despite your presence on our team , not because of it . " " Huh ? What the hell do political beliefs have to with ? " " Wait a minute , Jim , " Raymond broke in . " And you too , Simeon . I do n't want any bickering in here ! " " I 'm simply stating views that I expound regularly at our meetings , " Barchet said . " For your information , Mr. Harker , Cal Mitchison is the best publicity agent money can buy . I will not consent to his dismissal . " " You may have to consent to my resignation , then , " Harker said angrily . " Dammit , Mart , if I knew this outfit was run by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barchet warned . " Calm down , Jim . " Raymond came around his desk and , glowering down at Barchet , said , " Simeon , you know  | damned well Harker was approved by a majority of the board of directors . You 've got no business raising a squabble like this now . He was hired and he was given free rein  --  and if he wants to fire Mitchison , it 's within his prerogatives . " " I insist on bringing the matter before the board  --  and if Mitchison is dismissed without a proper vote , I 'll cause trouble . Good day , Dr. Raymond . " The little man sailed past Harker without a word and slammed the door . " What was he so upset about ? " Harker asked . Raymond slumped wearily into his chair . " Barchet 's the official voice of old Beller in this outfit  --  and you probably know how far to the right Beller was : he thought the Post Office was a socialist scheme . Barchet figures you 're an archradical because you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his book , and the Nat-Libs are direct agents of Antichrist . And the little bugger carries a lot of weight on the board , so we have to humor him . Within limits . " Harker nodded . He understood now what Raymond had meant when he said he had been " outvoted " in the matter of hiring Harker as first choice . It did not enhance his opinion of the management of Beller Research Laboratories . " I would n't blame you if you quit today , " Raymond said suddenly . " With Mitchison all hot to give the word to the public , and that idiot Klaus battling for my job because he 's tired of enzyme work and ready to experiment with power-tripping ? " " Klaus ? But he 's just a kid ! " " He 's twenty-nine , and for an ex-prodigy that 's ancient . Degree from Harvard at fifteen , that sort of thing . And hungry to get control . Does n't care what he gets control of ; he just wants control . I have to keep close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my back . " " Why not fire him ? " Harker suggested . " Two reasons . He 's got a contract , for one thing . And for another , I 'd rather have him with us than agin ' us , if you  | know what I mean . Lesser of two evils . At least when he 's close at hand I can see what he 's up to . " " Has it always been like this ? " " Always , " Raymond said . He sighed . " You get a necessary component of built-in paranoia whenever you bring together a group of the kind we 've got here . Oh , it 's a great little place , Jim . Sometimes I feel like closing the windows and turning up the gas . " He shook his head somberly . " But it would n't work . Some bastard would just drag me next door and bring me back to life , I guess . " He reached into the bookshelf and produced the liquor bottle . " One quick shot apiece , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you around back to show you the rest of the lab . " SIX The grand tour of the laboratory grounds was as disturbing as it was stimulating . Raymond marched Harker through room after room , showing him everything , passing up no cubbyhole or alcove where experimental work might be going on . " We do the serotonin diffraction in here . This room 's plasma research ; remind me to bring you back sometime when the big centrifuge is running . Fascinating stuff . This is Klaus 's enzyme lab  --  I 'd take you in , but he 's such a touchy bastard that there 's no sense provoking him needlessly  --  and down here ... " Harker puffed along behind the lab director , dazzled by the array of formidable and incomprehensible gadgetry , bewildered by the flow of unfamiliar terminology . He smiled a lot and tried to look as if he followed at least the rudiments . But he doubted that he was deceiving Raymond . He saw kennels where lively dogs bounded joyfully up and down and struggled to lick his hands through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that every dog in the room had been dead at least once , from periods ranging from a few minutes to twenty-eight hours . He met a grave little rhesus  | monkey that held the current laboratory record : two months previously , it had been dead for thirty-nine hours and had been revived with no loss of faculties . " We had a pair of them , " Raymond said . " We brought this fellow back without a hitch at the 39-hour mark , and held the other off for nine hours more in the hopes of making it to a full two-day no-life period . We did n't make it . The surviving monk moped for days . " Onward into a large room lined with memory drums , which Raymond said contained all the records of the Beller Laboratories since its opening in 2024 . It seemed to Harker that there must be several libraries ' worth of information on those drums : so much , so stupefyingly much information ! Onward . White-smocked researchers turned and looked up sullenly as Harker and his guide passed through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fluids bubbled and gurgled romantically through a maze of high-slung tubing ; they went out into the afternoon warmth and across to the other building , for more of the same . Much more . " Well , " Harker said finally , after they had returned to Raymond 's office , " I wo n't pretend I understood a thousandth of a percent of what I just saw . But now I comprehend the size of the operation you 're running here . It is n't just three scientists sitting around pouring stuff from one test tube into another and doing things with computers . It 's one hell of a busy place . " " Yes , " Raymond said . " Busy 's the word . And it gets results . Despite everything , it gets results . " Despite everything . Yes . Harker was beginning to get an image of Raymond as a doggedly able man surrounded by a tangled maze of obstacles and stumbling blocks , and bulling his way through the mess without stopping to complain . But why did there have to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too early for you to give me an outline of the program you 're planning ? " Harker hunched his shoulders uneasily . " It 's all still very much in the formative stages . I 'm seeing Governor Winstead  | on Friday , as you know , and early next week I expect to go down to Washington and talk to Senator Thurman . If we get those two on our side , the rest will be relatively easy . " " And if we do n't ? " " Then we have a fight , " Harker said quietly . " I wonder if you 're not being too pessimistic . Perhaps the best approach would be just to set up an instruction center and start resuscitating people . Stress the miraculous aspect : who would come out on the side of death against life ? " " We ca n't , Mart . You 're being just a little naive . There 's no way you can simply set up in business , not even if you limit use of the apparatus to fully qualified M.D.s . Leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face a bureaucratic mess . Any technique as radical as this is going to have to get approval from the Federal Department of Health , and they 'll simply boot it on up to the President for a ruling , and he 'll refer it to Congress . What we need is a federal law making your technique legal . The alternative is a court ruling , which means you 'd have to open shop in a selected state , get yourselves arrested , test the local laws on medical practice , work your way through a series of appeals until you hit the federal level ? " " Is there any law , federal or local , making it a crime to reanimate the dead ? " " There certainly is n't a federal law . Christ only knows what 's on state or municipal law codes  --  I 'll be running a data check on that aspect next week  --  but you can bet that if there are no such laws now , there 'll be some attempts to ram them through before long , as the emotions start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put through a law of our own ahead of the know-nothings in the state legislatures . " " I never dreamed we 'd have to force our process down the public 's throat , " Raymond said . " You 're in for an education . " Harker looked up . " Do you happen to have any idea how big our public-relations budget is ? "  | Raymond shrugged . " Pretty big . And flexible . I guess you could have up to three hundred thousand , three hundred fifty maybe , if you really needed it . " " Three hundred fifty million is more in line with what we 're going to need , " Harker said . He saw the stunned look on Raymond 's face and added hastily , " Certainly at least a million , to begin with . We might get by with that if we do a smart selling job . " " But why ? Why should it be necessary to sell the idea of restoring life ? You 'd think the people of the world would rise up and acclaim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would n't you ? " Harker shook his head bleakly . " We both know it does n't work that way , Mart . Anything that has to do with death scares people , even the undoing of death . When they 're scared , they make sick jokes , they grin in a lopsided way , they show their fear by acting against their own best interests . Never underestimate mankind 's capacity for irrationality . The war against unreason is a million years old , and unreason still wins a lot of the battles . If we 're going to put this thing across , we 're going to need a lot of public-relations skill , and skill costs money . And we ca n't let a bubblehead like Mitchison remain in charge of the selling operation . " " It 'll take a little time to fire him . " " Why ? " " You heard Barchet . Mitchison 's Barchet 's man . We 'll have to go through the board of directors to get rid of Mitchison , and it 'll require some careful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I 'm afraid not . I do n't mean to underestimate your political skills , Jim , but this is a matter of personalities , not of public issues , and unless you know the people involved , know how to push exactly the right buttons in their heads ? " " All right . How long will the button-pushing take ? " " Two weeks , maybe three , " Raymond said . " Will that hold things up very seriously ? "  | " We 'll manage , " Harker said . " Just as long as Mitchison can be kept on a tight leash until we 've gotten rid of him . " Harker spent the next morning at his office , tidying up unfinished business . The delayer on the Bryant hearing had come through , and he read the document a couple of times with great care before filing it . He phoned the Bryant home and learned that the old spaceman was very low ; the penguinoid doctor refused to let Harker speak with him , muttering something about maintaining potassium balances by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jonathan Bryant somewhere behind that ukase , but there was n't much he could do about it . A nasty business . Jonathan had deliberately obtained the stay of hearing in the hope that his father would die before the case came before the court . Well , the old man could n't last much longer in any event , but Harker hoped he 'd hang on at least until after the hearing . He left the office at noon , taking with him a pile of printouts that he had requisitioned from the library in the hope of picking up some scientific background on the general field of reanimation and specifically on the aspects of DNA/ RNA rebuilding by which a partly decomposed brain could be induced to repair itself . By early afternoon he was home . His home life had been suffering more than a little in the week  --  was it only a week ? ? since he had plunged himself fully into the Beller Labs assignment . During those seemingly endless few days , he had been coming home at odd hours , which upset Lois @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tending to brood a lot , which made things rough for his hearty , extroverted children . Still , everybody was being very co-operative about the situation . They had been through spells like this before , in his office-seeking days , when clock and calendar ceased to matter and all normal rhythms of life were swept aside by the urgency of special demands . In the past , he had managed to make  | things up to them when the pressure let up . He would do that again this time . If the pressure ever let up . Thursday passed slowly . Harker remained at home , sticking close to his study and trying to make his way through the material he had brought home . But he learned very little from it . Nothing about the Beller reanimation technique had been published yet , of course , and so his request for information had drawn from the computer only a series of technical papers beyond his comprehension and surely obsolete . He came away from his homework knowing not very much more than he had learned from Raymond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a veneer of terms he could use to impress those whose scientific knowledge was even flimsier than his own , but that was all . Skimming the surface . A politician 's trick , he thought . But what else could he do ? He woke early on Friday , before six , and made breakfast for himself . By the time he had turned off the autocook and set the kitchen servo to mop-up , Lois and the children were moving about upstairs . They came down for breakfast before he was ready to leave . " Up early today , eh , Dad ? " Chris said . " I have to make a 9:30 plane , " Harker explained . Paul appeared , thumbing his eyes and yawning . " Where are you going , Daddy ? " " Albany . " The seven-year-old seemed to awaken immediately . " Albany ? Are you Governor again ? " " Hush , stupid ! " Chris said savagely . Harker smiled and shook his head . " No , I wo n't ever be Governor any more , Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the Governor now . " " Oh , " the boy said gravely . Harker reached the Westchester jet terminal at ten past nine . The 150-seat shuttle was waiting on the field , surrounded by a glittering phalanx of servos getting the plane tanked up and ready for the flight . The trip to Albany  | would take just under thirteen minutes . It had taken Harker twice that long to get to the terminal from his home . Takeoff came on schedule . Harker toyed with his newspaper , reading no more than the headlines , as the plane roared northward . It barely had time to reach cruising altitude before it was coming down again . A smooth and uneventful landing at the Albany airport ; then half an hour more for the jetport bus to bring him across the Hudson into the capital city . His appointment with Governor Winstead was set for eleven that morning . He had plenty of time . Disdaining the public transport service , the horrors of which he knew all too well , Harker walked through town to the Governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found himself hoping no one would recognize him ; but , when no one did after he had walked a few blocks , he realized that he was obscurely disappointed at being accorded such anonymity . It was only a few months , after all , since he had left office . Albany did n't seem any more attractive to him now than when he had been Governor . He had spent only the statutory minimum of time in this third-rate , dirty , bedraggled town ; like most Governors of the past eighty or ninety years , he had run the state out of a rented office in New York City , coming up here merely for the sessions of the legislature . Now he stared sourly at the rundown hotels , the fly-specked restaurants , the ramshackle houses . And there , in the middle of everything , was the marble splendor of the Rockefeller Mall , absurdly majestic , like the Forum of Imperial Rome rising out of a trash dump . What a preposterous , pretentious project that had been ! Everyone would have been better off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some simple plastic-block housing for the necessary government offices , instead of erecting that glittering , pompous monument in the midst of all this squalor . One of Harker 's proposed reforms had been to move the state capital downstate to New York City , where it had always  | really belonged ; but naturally the force of sentiment was solidly against him , not to mention the American-Conservative Party , which counted Albany and all the rest of upstate New York among its strongholds . Harker managed a faint smile at the memory of that struggle . He had fought so many losing battles in his four years as Governor . The guards at the Governor 's mansion recognized him , of course , and duly tipped their hats . Harker grinned and greeted them by name . It was curious to see them still at their posts , but of course their jobs , unlike his , had been protected by civil-service regulations . So they had stayed , and he was out . In an odd way , that made him feel inferior . He traversed the familiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's office , greeting him with an outstretched hand and a faintly abashed smile . It was no secret that Winstead had been one of the leaders , as well as the chief beneficiary , of the cabal that had denied Harker the renomination . " So glad you could come up here , Jim , " Winstead murmured . ' We like to have the old boys revisit the shop . " " It 's not a courtesy call , Leo . I 'm here to ask some advice . " " Any way I can help , Jim , you know I will . " Winstead beckoned Harker to a seat . It was strange to be sitting on this side of the desk . Harker had n't done that since his days as Mayor of New York City when he 'd had to trek up to Albany to beg crumbs of financial support from the state administration . He searched for ways to begin saying what he had come here to say . He sensed the other man 's deep embarrassment , and shared it to some degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ex-Governor was complex and many-leveled . Winstead was ten years his senior : a good party man , a reliable workhorse who had come up through the ranks of  | the Manhattan District Attorney 's office and had turned down a judgeship because he thought he had a shot at the race for the gubernatorial nomination . But the party had chosen the bright , meteorically rising young mayor , James Harker , to be the standard-bearer instead , and an avalanche of Nat-Lib votes from downstate had swept Harker in . Then it had become politically desirable to discard Harker four years later , and good , dependable old Leo Winstead was trotted out of private law practice to take his place . Because Harker had chosen not to start a fight in the primaries , the dropping of an incumbent had n't hurt the party at the polls ; New York City went for Winstead almost as enthusiastically as it had for Harker in the previous election , the American-Conservative candidate lost whole counties upstate through overconfidence and general incompetence , and now it was Leo Winstead at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young , no longer speculated about chances of using the governorship as his springboard into the White House . Harker said , " Leo , you carry weight with the party . I do n't any more . " " Do n't bother apologizing , Leo , because it 's my fault and not any of yours that I 'm where I am now . I 'm simply asking you to exert some influence on behalf of a project I 'm involved in . A favor , Leo , and not a small one . " It was a naked attempt at lobbying . Harker hoped Winstead 's guilt feelings , conscious or otherwise , would lead him to provide , his support . " What sort of project , Jim ? " " It 's  --  well , I 'd have to call it a revolutionary breakthrough in science , Leo . A process capable of reanimating people who have been dead less than twenty-four hours , provided the cause of death was n't something that did irreversible damage to their bodies , like jumping off the top of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are you serious ? "  | " Dead serious . I 'm going down to Washington next week to see Thurman . This thing really works  --  and I want to get it legally approved for public use . " " And where do I come in ? " " You 're a powerful official , Leo . You help to shape opinion in this state . If you came out in praise of this new development , said the state would take action to make the process available to its citizens as soon as ? " " Dangerous business , Jim . The Church is sure to ? " " I know all about the Church and what it 's sure to . I 'm also aware that our friends in the other party will probably oppose it , if for no other reason than it 's a positive step forward in human society . What of that ? You expect reactionaries to be reactionary . But the Nat-Libs , under the same principle , will have to take a favorable stand . " " Suppose we do n't ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he ran his knotty hands nervously through his bushy shock of white hair . " You know as well as I do that this is no time to hop off supporting anything too farfetched . " Harker began to feel exasperation rising . " Farfetched ? Leo , I saw a dead man come back to life right in front of me . If you think ? " " I do n't think anything . Thinking 's not my job . If you 'll pardon my saying so , Jim , you did much too much thinking for your own good when you were in Albany . This thing has to be handled with kid gloves . It would n't surprise me to see the government clamp down and bottle the whole business up until every aspect of it 's been fully explored . I mean , how can you start letting a bunch of dead people get up and walk around again until you know whether ? " " Federal Research Act of ' 92 , " Harker said thinly . " It guarantees freedom from government interference in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Winstead was perspiring heavily . " Laws can be repealed or amended , Jim . And they can be very easily circumvented , as you perfectly well know . Listen here , Jim : why  | do n't you go to see Thurman before you tie me up in any sort of commitment ? Find out how he stands on the matter . Then come back here and maybe we can talk about it some more , okay ? " It was obviously a dismissal . Winstead had no eagerness to get involved so early in something with so many ramifications as this . Keeping a low profile had been the key to his success in life . Tiredly Harker rose . " Okay . I 'll see Thurman and check back with you afterward . " " Good . " " One more thing , Leo : this process has n't been made public yet . Since you 're aware of the fuss it 's going to kick up , I hope you 'll be kind enough to keep your mouth shut until we 're ready to spring it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course . " SEVEN It was a very long weekend . Harker reached his home at half past five that evening , having parted from Winstead at noon and become entangled in commuter-traffic snarls at several stages of his homeward journey . Before heading to the terminal he had stopped for a drink and a miserable chlorella-steak lunch on the wrong side of State Street . Again he went unrecognized . There was no way he could unload the coil of tension tightening around him . Chris was watching the video when he came in . He hopped up immediately and said , " Drink , Dad ? " as though reading the signs of some terrible need in Harker 's face . " Martini . Very dry . " The boy busied himself with the pushbutton controls of the autobar while Harker hung up his hat and jacket . Lois emerged from the kitchen . She asked him how his meeting with Winstead had gone , and he told her in a few dispirited syllables.  | " Dr. Raymond from the lab called , " she said . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . " " Did he say what about ? " " No . " Harker reached for the phone , yanked down on the longdistance switch , and punched out Raymond 's number , hoping Raymond himself would pick up and not Klaus or Barchet or someone like that . He got Raymond . The lab director looked inquisitively out of the screen , and Harker told him exactly what Winstead had said . When he had finished the flat , weary recital , he added , " I 'm going to Washington on Monday . But if Thurman gives me the brush-off , too , we may be in trouble . " " We 'll get through somehow , Jim . " Raymond 's heartiness was unconvincing . " Have faith . " " I wish I could , " Harker said , He sipped the drink Chris put in his hand and , after a little of the cold gin had filtered into his bloodstream , he began to feel better . It was a false comfort , he knew , but that was better than no comfort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , scooped up a cassette almost at random , slipped it into the playback slot . Handers Messiah , Part III . Well , why not ? A little spiritual grace . From the speakers came the opening aria of the section , the big soprano number : ... I know that my redeemer liveth , and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth : And though worms destroy this body , yet in my flesh shall I see God . For now is Christ risen from the dead .. . After the final notes of the aria had died away came the chorus , slow , grave : .. Since by man came death , by man came also the resurrection of the dead . For as in Adam all die , even so in Christ shall all be made alive . . .  | The jubilant tones of " even so in Christ " sent startling shivers of illumination through him ; it was as if he had never listened to these words before . " Since by man came death , by man came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him everywhere . Twenty minutes later , after the last melisma of " Amen , " he abruptly turned the set off . Time for dinner . He ate quietly , deep in thought . No one dared to talk to him . Saturday was a little better . He worked around the house , took Chris and Paul for a long hike through the wildlife sanctuary in early afternoon , spent some time before dinner watching the telecast of the Yankee-Dodger interleague game from Los Angeles . In the evening he and Lois visited neighbors . The Harkers were making a determined effort to fit into the community ; they had even given up the apartment in New York that he had maintained by way of a token political foothold in the city . It was a pleasant , relaxed three or four hours that night . He was beginning to think he could forget about his new burden . But reminders were inescapable . On Sunday , at breakfast , Paul came struggling in , wobbling under the bulk of the Sunday Times , and Lois brought the pancakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . Harker took the paper from Paul and said to Chris , " Switch on the audio . Let 's see if there 's anything on the morning news . " Click . A resonant , cavernous voice : " .. he saith unto them , Our friend Lazarus sleepeth ; but I go , that I may awake him out of sleep . Then said his disciples , Lord , if he sleep , he shall do well . Howbeit Jesus spake of his death : but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep . Then said Jesus unto them plainly , Lazarus is dead . And I ? " Impatiently Chris reached out and changed the station . Harker shook his head , annoyed . " No , Chris . Get that back . I want to hear it . " " The Bible , Dad ? "  | Harker nodded impatiently . As Chris , shrugging , began to search for the station , Lois said , " That was St. Matthew , was n't it ? " " St. John , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harker said with a chuckle . " Your father ought to hear you saying a thing like that ! " Lois ' father had been a stern , Bible-quoting Presbyterian , a consciously eighteenth-century figure ; he had never approved of Harker . Chris had the station again . The radio preacher was say-ing : ... Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid . And Jesus lifted up his eyes , and said , Father , I thank thee that thou hast heard me . And I knew that thou hearest me always : but because of the people which stand by I said it , that they may believe that thou hast sent me . And when he thus had spoken , he cried with a loud voice , Lazarus , come forth ! And he that was dead came forth , bound hand and foot with graveclothes ; and his face was bound about with a napkin . Jesus saith unto them ? " Harker broke in suddenly : " All right . You can tune in something else now . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , Dad ? " " It 's a very famous passage . " Harker smiled . " And I have a feeling we 're all going to get to know it pretty well before summer comes . " After dinner Sunday he packed for his trip to Washington ; he took an extra change of clothes , because Thurman 's secretary had warned him that the Senator was very busy and might not be able to see him until Tuesday . Fine treatment to give a man who had once been virtually the titular head of the party , Harker thought sourly . But voicing a complaint , he knew , would have done him less than no good . He came downstairs again after packing , and spent the next couple of hours in front of the screen with his family ,  | watching something silly and mindless , ideally designed to ease the overburdened soul . Bursts of incandescent colors , skyrocketing patterns , cameras sliding in and out of phase , music leaping from speaker to speaker . At a quarter past nine , in the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blank ; the NEWS BULLETIN insignia appeared ; then an announcer 's face came into view . " We interrupt this program to bring you a special bulletin from our newsroom . " Richard Bryant , last survivor of Earth 's first successful manned voyage to another world , died quietly in his sleep at his Manhattan apartment an hour ago . He would have been eighty-seven next month .

Then , when his two fellow astronauts began to develop symptoms of ? " Harker did n't need to hear the rest of the story . He turned to Lois and said bitterly , " They did n't even give him a chance . The hearing would have been last Thursday , but his stinking son managed to get a postponement . Knowing that the old man could n't hang on much longer . " " Will this affect the outcome of the case , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was pretty damned solid . Still , I wanted old Bryant to have the satisfaction of knowing he died on top . And instead he went out like this ? wondering , uncertain , worried ? " Harker scowled . " If any of them had any guts , they would have lied to him right at the end , told him his will had been upheld . But of course they would n't even do that . They 're just so many vultures . They 're probably having a celebration now . Champagne and caviar . " C6 99 Jim " Never mind . I think I 'll try to phone . As the old man 's lawyer I suppose I ought to get in touch . " He went upstairs to his study and switched on the phone .  | He punched out the Bryant number in quick angry jabs . An intercept service took the call and a bland voice said , " We represent the Bryant family . Only friends of the family and immediate relatives can be connected just now , sir . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , staring malevolently at the monogrammed pattern on the screen of his phone . " James Harker . They 'll take a call from me . Please put me through . " A pause .

If you wish to record a message for transmission to any member of the family , please speak when you hear the beeping tone . " Beep . Harker hung up . The intercept service 's monogram disappeared from the screen . He did n't have anything to say to the Bryants just now . Instead , he punched out another number : the home phone of Tom Auerbach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bryant hearing the following week . The judge answered his phone himself : plump-faced , sleepy-looking . Harker said , " Sorry to bother you on a Sunday night , Tom . You 've heard about Bryant ? " Auerbach nodded . " Too bad , I guess . But of course he was in bad shape . " " He 's better off at rest , yes . Look , Tom , his sons are being sticky about taking phone calls . I 'm on the blacklist and I ca n't get through to them . Has Jonathan phoned you tonight ? " " No . Was he supposed to ? " " I do n't know , " Harker said . " I just want to notify you  | that I 'll be out of town on business tomorrow and maybe Tuesday , in case you or he or anybody else wants to reach me about this case . But I 'll be back in plenty of time for the hearing on Thursday . There is n't another motion for a postponement , is there ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I doubt that there will be . Now that the old man 's dead . I 'll see you on Thursday , then . " " On Thursday . " Harker went downstairs . The bulletin had ended and the ballet was back on the screen . " Well ? " Lois asked . " I could n't get through to the Bryants . They 've hired an intercept service and I was n't on the list . I spoke to Tom Auerbach , though . There 's been no new move for a postponement . Jonathan just did n't want the old man to be alive when it was held . " " But now there should be some sort of mourning period , should n't there ? " Lois asked . " Before the court proceedings resume ? " " A lot that matters to any of them , " Harker said . Kennedy Airport was a busy place the following morning . Surging crowds boiled through every building , and the parking lots were stacked five levels deep with cars . Neon boards flashed departures and arrivals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flustered head counts ; servoporters rolled by , hidden under immense mounds of tourist luggage . Every few moments the deepbellied boom of engines roared across the sky . Harker , in the midst of all this nervous urgency , felt the contagion of it reaching him . And he was only flying down to Washington , a quick hop by air capsule , nine minutes up and nine minutes down . While , all about him , unlikely-looking people were blasting off for Bangkok , McMurdo Sound , Nairobi , Chittagong , Tokyo , Anchorage , Acapulco , Auckland , Shanghai , Leningrad , Havana , Vienna , Addis Ababa .. . nmmmnnm. mOl  | Tension rose in him as he shuffled toward the check-in counter . So much was hanging on this journey , now . He had checked off two of the three names on his original scrawled list of key contacts ; neither had been able to offer much in the way of encouragement . The only name remaining was that of Senator Clyde Thurman . Thurman represented the old guard of the National-Liberal Party , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republicans in the old days before the collapse and realignment of the twentieth-century political structures ; Harker had never felt comfortable with them , and there was no telling how Thurman would react to the news that a technique had been developed for " Attention , please . Telephone call for passenger James Harker , passenger Harker , please . Kindly report to the nearest ticket desk . Telephone call for passenger James Harker . . . " Puzzled , Harker shoved his way through the crowd around the desk and said to the uniformed check-in clerk , " I 'm Harker . I was just paged . " " You can pick it up in there . " Harker stepped through into a waiting room and picked up an extension phone , audio only , no screen . He gave his name to the operator . There were the sounds of phone jacks being plugged into and yanked out of sockets . Then Mart Raymond 's voice said , " Hello ? Jim ? " " Harker here . Is that you , Mart ? " " Oh , thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , and your wife said you were already on your way to the airport , and when I called the airport they did n't seem to have any record of you at first , and then ? " Harker had never heard Raymond this excited before . " Whoa , boy ! Calm down ! " " I ca n't . Turn in your ticket and get out to the labs right away ! " " Are you kidding ? I 'm about to fly down to Washington and see Thurman. "  | " The hell with Thurman . Have n't you heard the news ? " " What news ? " " You have n't heard , " Raymond muttered . " What the hell is it , Mart ? " " The project , Jim . I guess you could n't have heard . It only broke half an hour ago , maybe forty-five minutes at most , and I suppose you ? " Harker said , in as level a voice as he could manage , " Mart , what are you trying to tell me ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little while ago . Issued a statement . Describing the project , telling the world about everything . The whole process . Reporters are already showing up here . And we 're getting calls . Bombarded . Jim , you 've got to get out here at once ! " " Christ , " Harker said , " I do n't want to believe any of this . " " You better , " Raymond said . " I need you here , Jim . Fast . " He hung up . Harker let the receiver drop into its cradle . His fingers were shaking . His throat was dry . The mask had been ripped away . They stood exposed . From now on , they were accountable to the world for their every move . EIGHT Harker had thought the airport was in a state of confusion , but he realized he still had a lot to learn about ultimate chaos when he reached Litchfield an hour later . Cars clogged the highway for a quarter of a mile on each side of the private road leading to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an army of network technicians , men whose faces he thought he recognized from the news programs . There were copters overhead , dangling mikes and hovercameras . Tumult , disruption , shouts , the glare of brilliant lights  --  an invading army was sweeping toward the labs .  | He ducked somehow through the milling mob and tried to slip unobtrusively along the spruce-bordered dirt road to the administration building . But it was a foredoomed attempt ; he had n't taken more than ten steps before somebody yelled , " Hey ! There 's Governor Harker ! " A dozen of them surrounded him in half a minute . Through the retina-dazzling blaze of their cameras he was able to make out a few faces familiar from his days as Mayor  --  a couple of Times men , one from the Star-Post , that miserable girl from the News , a phalanx from CBS . Harker strode grimly along , trying to ignore them , but they encircled him , blocking his path , and the only way he could get through would be by knocking them aside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that did n't deter them . He felt like a hare ringed by hounds . " What are you doing here , Governor ? " " Can you give us an opinion on the reanimation bit ? You think it 's a hoax ? " " How will the Nat-Libs react ? " " Do you figure there 'll be a Congressional investigation ? " " Are you connected with this outfit in any way ? " They crowded around him , waving microphones and notebooks . He tried to force them back , but they came rushing on , babbling as they advanced . He took a deep breath and bellowed , cutting through their rush of queries , " Hold on , all of you ! Will you shut up and let me talk ? " They grew quiet . " In answer to half a dozen of your questions , I 'm here because I 'm legal adviser to Beller Laboratories . The statement that was released to the press earlier this morning was an unofficial and possibly inaccurate one . I 've got no comment on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can tell you right now that it was altogether unauthorized and does n't represent any reliable position that this laboratory may hold . I 'll have an official statement for you just as soon as I can find out what 's been going on around this place today . "  | " Does that mean the reanimation process does n't actually exist , Governor ? " " I repeat : I 'll have an official statement later . I ca n't tell you a thing yet , and that is n't because I 'm trying to be evasive . I need to know who issued that release and what was in it , first . But you 'll have the whole story before the day is over . I promise you that . Will you let me go now ? " It was the only way to handle them . He swung around , pushing his way firmly but with care between the Times and NBC , and headed up the hill with quick , forceful strides . The roadblock still functioned  --  only this time there were five guards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rifles , the other two burp guns . Their belts were studded with anti-personnel grenades . Coming up to them , Harker said , " How come all the artillery ? " " It 's the only way we can keep them back , Mr. Harker . They 've been trying to smash right into the labs . You better go in , fast . " " Where 's Dr. Raymond ? " " In his office . " Harker nodded grimly and stepped through the cordon . He trotted the rest of the way . Raymond 's office was crowded . Barchet was there , and Lurie , and two or three of the other administrators . Raymond , his face gray and stony , sat half slumped behind his desk . " Here , " he said as Harker rushed in . " Read this . It 's the text of Mitchison 's handout . " Harker grabbed it . Litchfield , N.J. , 20 May ( for immediate release ) ? Security wraps today came off an eight-year-old project that is destined to be the greatest boon to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process for bringing dead people back to life has left the experimental stage and is now ready for public demonstration , according to famed Harvard-trained biochemist David Klaus , 29 , who has  | spearheaded the astonishing research drive in its climactic months . Klaus stated , " The technique we have perfected at this laboratory will make possible restoration of life in all cases where death has taken place no more than twenty-four hours before the reanimation attempt , provided no serious organic damage was the cause of termination of life . A combination of nucleic-acid induction , hormone therapy , and electrochemical stimulation makes this astonishing and miraculous process possible . Our experimental results thus far have confirmed the most optimistic hopes we entertained at the outset of the project . " The Beller Research Laboratories of Litchfield , established in 2024 under a grant from the late Darwin F. Beller , were the birthplace for this scientific breakthrough . The laboratory grounds will shortly be opened for demonstrations of the reanimation process . More to come . Cal Mitchison , Publicity . Harker dropped the sheet contemptuously to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bad thinking  --  not even a good Xeroxing job . Mart , how the dickens could a thing like this have happened ? " " Klaus and Mitchison must have cooked it up last night and put it in the hopper for distribution first thing this morning . They managed to get copies of it to the local press-service stringers in town , and phoned it to every media input in the metropolitan area . " " He moved too fast , " Harker muttered . " He did n't give us time to fire him . Well ? Where is he now ? " " Gone , " Raymond said , shrugging . " Both he and Klaus . I sent men looking for them as soon as I found out about the press release , but no sign of them . " " Operation Barn Door , " Harker snapped . " Most likely they 're over in Manhattan giving video interviews or holding a press conference . I see Mitchison did n't bother to mention anybody 's name but Klaus 's in this handout of his . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Harker shook his head dismally . Suddenly he whirled on  | Barchet , who just now was looking unusually small and meek , with none of his earlier , blustery self-assurance . " You ! You 're the one who brought Mitchison into this outfit ! His sponsor . His defender . Can you defend this ? " In a tiny voice Barchet said , " Recriminations are useless now , Mr. Harker . " " The hell with that . Did you tell Mitchison I was going to have him canned ? " " Mr. Harker , I ? " " Did you ? " Helplessly Barchet nodded . Harker glared at him . Turning to Raymond he said , " There you have it , Mart . Mitchison knew he was getting the sack , so he whipped this thing out in a hurry , I suppose so he could get fat at our expense . Well , we 're stuck with his idiot statement . There are two million reporters on the front lawn waiting for official word from us . " Raymond ran his fingers through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hands over his forehead . In a sepulchral voice he said , " What do you suggest we do ? Deny the Mitchison release outright ? " " Impossible , " Harker said . " The word has gone out . Everybody 's talking about us now . If we try to nix the story , we end up looking frivolous or secretive or both , and nobody will ever believe anything else we say . Uh-uh . " " What , then ? " " We try to keep cool . First thing is to prepare a release saying that the early announcement was premature and unauthorized , that it was sent out by a couple of disgruntled former employees out to make trouble , and ? " " Klaus has a contract . " " The contract has a clause in it about termination for cause , or else it is n't worth a damn . Gross insubordination sounds like cause to me . Klaus exceeded whatever authority he may have had by conspiring with Mitchison to send that thing out . Have somebody get a letter off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informing him  | that his contract is voided as of so-and-so hour this morning , and telling him why . Make a lot of copies . Send a letter of dismissal to Mitchison , too . " Harker paused to wipe sweat from his face . The room was small and crowded ; the air conditioners were overloading under the stress . He went on , " Next thing : I 'll draft a proper release confirming the fact that the reanimation process exists , and going into somewhat more detail than theirs . I 'll sign my name to it . When I 'm done , have it run off and distributed to everybody out there , and make sure there 's a total media coverage besides . I 'll call in a couple of my media men to handle that end of it . By getting out our own release we 'll cancel Mitchison 's poop to some degree . And after that ? " Harker paused . " Do you have any human cadavers around the place ? Revivable ones , I mean ? " " Not at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Find one . Hook or crook . We 'll give a demonstration of the process to an audience of newsmen . Allowing them to film or tape it , of course , and following it with a detailed briefing session on everything they 've just seen . And then ? " " Do n't you think that 's a little risky ? " Lurie asked mildly . ' What ? The demonstration ? " " Yes , " Lurie said , with a foolish grin . " Well , I mean , something might go wrong ? " " Such as what ? " " There are flaws in the process , " Raymond cut in . " I do n't want you to have the impression that it 's foolproof yet , Jim . Or to give that impression to anybody else . I was meaning to talk about this part with you , but I did n't get a chance , and now  --  well , this thing came up , and  --  we need time to iron out the remaining bugs before we can dare call in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harker said . He felt a chill beginning to climb his back . In a flat voice he said , " You gave me the impression that this process of yours worked every time . That if the body was in good enough shape to be brought back 76  | to life , and had n't started to decay , you could revive it . It was on that basis that I came aboard , Mart . Suppose you tell me about these so-called bugs , ' right here and now . " There was a brief , ominous silence in the room . Harker saw Raymond glare fiercely at Lurie , who cowered ; the other staff people looked uneasy , and Barchet , rodentlike , nibbled at his fingertips . At last Raymond said , " I 'm sorry . We were n't playing straight with you . " " Go on . I want to know everything now . " " The process is n't as foolproof as we made it seem . About one time out of twenty , we ca n't bring the subject back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely intact . " " Understandable , " Harker said . " A five-percent failure rate in something as far out as this is n't any cause for apologies . If that 's the whole trouble ? " " It is n't . Jim , you have to understand that death is a tremendous shock to the nervous system  --  the biggest shock there is . That should go without saying . It 's an affront to the ego , so to speak . We all secretly believe we are n't going to die , and when we do find ourselves dying , well , the jolt can be translated into direct physical impact . Sometimes the shock is so great that it short-circuits the brain , in a manner of speaking . I 'm not talking about the organic decay of brain tissue that sets in during second-level mortality ; I 'm talking about something subtler , a cerebral incapacity that develops in the instant of death and ca n't be measured , ca n't , therefore , be repaired . And in such cases , even though we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the mind is not always reanimated with the body . " Harker was stunned as if by a physical blow . He took one step backward , groped for a chair , and lowered himself heavily into it . The mind is not always reanimated . A cerebral incapacity that develops in the instant of death .  | No . No . He forced himself into a kind of frigid calmness and said , " Just how often does this happen ? " " About one out of every six tries , so far . " " I see . " Harker drew his breath in sharply , cleared his throat , crossed and uncrossed his legs . With such fidgeting gestures he fought to keep his self-control . This whole enterprise had begun to take on an unreal atmosphere , a dreamlike texture , in the few hours since he had been summoned from the airport . And this was the crusher . One revivification out of six would produce a live idiot . A zombie . Wonderful . A public demonstration , then , would be like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the whole show would blow up in their faces . " How long will it take you to clean this thing up ? " Harker asked . " All I can say is that we 're working on it . We think we see a solution , but we do n't know how close we are . Or even if we 're on the right track . " " Okay . Forget the public demonstration , then . We do n't dare try it until we 're surer of the outcome . " Harker shook his head . " Remind me to cut your throat for this , Mart . The first free moment I have . " There was a knock at the door . Harker gestured to Barchet , who opened it . One of the laboratory guards looked in . " The reporters are getting out of hand , " he said . " They want to know when some sort of statement will be forthcoming . " Harker checked his watch . Five to eleven . He said , " Tell them I 'll have their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir . " " I need a typewriter , " Harker said to Raymond . A typewriter was produced . Harker had never been comfortable giving dictation . He fed a sheet of paper in , switched the current on , and began to type , a blurt of words , then a line of strike-overs , then another blurt . A hasty statement began to emerge , covering half a page or so : it disowned Mitchison as a spokesman , credited Raymond properly as 78  | head of the project  --  making no mention of Klaus  --  and declared that full details of the technique would be released as soon as they were ready . He signed it James Harker , with a flourish , and added parenthetically ( Former Governor of New York  --  at present legal adviser to Beller Research Laboratories ) . " Here , " he said , handing the release to Raymond . " Read this thing through , make any changes you want , give me your approval . Then get it Xeroxed and distributed to that wolf pack out there . Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lounge A , " Lurie offered . Lounge A was in the small dormitory in back . Harker said , as he started to leave the office , " I 'm going over there to pick up the news reports . Lurie , you 're in charge of finding me office space someplace in Dormitory A. I want a phone , a television , a radio , and a typewriter . And I do n't care who has to get pushed out to make room for me . " " Yes , sir . " " Do it now . " Harker jogged across the clearing toward Dormitory A , pausing only to look back briefly at the horde of media people straining at the barrier down the hill . Lounge A was packed with lab researchers , clustered around the video . They moved to one side as Harker entered . He recognized Vogel and said to the bearded surgeon , " Has there been much about us on yet ? " Vogel laughed . " Much ? Hardly anything but ! " Harker stared at the screen . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . a discovery of staggering significance , he said , provided we can accept this morning 's statement as genuine . Similar comments came from . . . a discussion of the implications of . . . awaiting analysis of the claim that . . . further details will be brought to you as information reaches the network newsroom ... " Harker wrenched the channel-selector dial one turn to the left . Another news bulletin ; a thin-lipped blond girl was saying in crisp , glacial tones , " . . . called for an immediate Sen-79  | ate investigation . The cry was echoed by Nat-Lib Senator Clyde Thurman of New York , who declared that such a scientific breakthrough would have to be placed under careful federal regulation . Meanwhile , from Europe , first overseas response has been tentative and guarded , with . . . " A third channel offered : " ... Presidential Press Secretary Richardson said that the President would have no comment on the news until he had had a chance to study the entire situation . Vice-President Szabo , attending a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about twenty minutes ago , This is not as incredible a development as superficial appearances might seem to indicate . Science has long had the power to save human lives ; this is merely the next step forward . We should not lose our sense of proportion in considering this matter and let our emotions run away with themselves . On the other hand , we must take care not to place excessive credence in the so-called reanimation process until we are absolutely certain ... " Harker felt a sudden need for fresh air . He muscled his way through the crowded lounge and out onto the dormitory porch . Confusion seemed to be reigning everywhere . His initial plans for making a methodical survey of the situation before making any overt moves had gone up in one puff of idiotic press-agentry ; from here on , he would have to improvise everything , setting his course with desperate agility . He tried to tell himself that things would quiet down before long , once the initial impact of the news had expended itself . But he was too well schooled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making himself believe any such naive notion . The man in the street could be thinking only one thing now : that the power of death over mankind had ended . In future days , death would have no dominion . Therefore let us celebrate . But how would the public react , beyond that first moment of joy ? Would terror replace jubilation as the second thoughts began ? What would they say when they learned  | that life could be restored five times out of six , but the sixth time a mindless , soulless thing was the product ? Fear and trembling lay ahead , and days of uncertainty . Standing under the warm mid-May sun , Harker stared up at the sky as if he hoped to be able to look into tomorrow . The sky held no answers . Confusion would be tomorrow 's watchword . And there was no turning back now , not for any of them . NINE Harker held his first news conference at half past three that afternoon , in the office that Lurie had hastily rigged for him on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had become clear to him that he was not only the legal adviser of the laboratory but had been transformed into the public spokesman , publicity director , and chairman of the board as well . Everyone , Mart Raymond included , seemed perfectly willing to delegate responsibility to him . He drew up a list of eight selected media representatives ? three newspapers , both press services , the three video networks  --  and invited them to send reporters to his conference . That press pool would have to suffice ; he was n't going to expose himself to the entire crowd just yet . He told them very concisely what the Beller technique was , how it had been developed , who was responsible for the work , and what the process could do . He used a few technical terms that he had picked up in his weekend reading . He did not mention the fact that the technique was not without flaws . When he had finished his explanation , he called for questions . Surprisingly few were forthcoming . The announcement seemed to have stilled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they did ask were off the mark , irrelevancies that never came close to probing the areas 81  | where Harker knew the process was vulnerable . He managed to bring the conference to a close unscathed , leaving his interviewers with the impression that they had learned much more than they really had . He promised to make himself available for further briefings every day in midafternoon at the Litchfield office . As they left , he wondered how much of what he had said would reach the public in reasonably undistorted form , and how much would emerge garbled and sensationalized . Toward evening , he started finding out . Harker got home about seven , utterly exhausted . Lois met him at the door , anxious-faced , tense . She said she had been listening to the news all day , following the developments as they unfolded . She had heard his name again and again ; she had seen the clips of his news conference on three different broadcasts . Almost like the old days , she said . A celebrity again . But his return to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as it had his . His sons stared at him curiously , as if he had undergone some strange and incomprehensible transformation during the day . " I 'll be spending most of my time at Litchfield until things get calmer , " he said . " I may even have to sleep out there for a while . This was n't the way I intended to do it , but ? " The phone rang . Automatically Harker started to reach for it , but he pulled back and said , " Will you find out who it is , Lois ? If it 's anybody official , tell him I 'm not home yet . I 'm not home to anyone except Mart Raymond . " Lois picked up the telephone . She listened wordlessly for a couple of moments and put it down . She bit her lip . " Who was it ? " " A crank , " she said . " Mumbling a lot of incoherent nonsense . There 've been a lot of those calls today , Jim . This must have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuisances . All right , if that 's going to start so soon , I 'll have the number changed tomorrow . " The late editions of two New York newspapers lay on the 82  | hassock near his chair . He picked up the Star-Post . A redinked banner screamed : CAN LIFE BE RESTORED ? READ NOBEL WINNER 'S OPINION ! Harker glanced at the article . It was by Carlos Rodriguez , the Peruvian poet , winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2o18 , now on a lecture tour in the United States and conveniently available to turn out a quick statement for a local newspaper . His piece was a philosophical discussion of man 's right to bring back the dead , written in a murky , portentous , obscure way . Harker struggled through about three paragraphs ; then he abruptly abandoned it when another headline , in the lower right-hand corner , attracted his notice : RICK BRYANT TO REMAIN DEAD , SAY SPACE PIONEER 'S HEIRS New York , May zo  --  The body of 86-year-old Richard Bryant , Mars-going astronaut hero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schedule tomorrow morning , a family spokesman declared . Responding to growing public sentiment in favor of granting the famed spaceman a reprieve from death , his eldest son , Jonathan Bryant , released this statement : " The unanimous feeling of this family is that my father should go to his eternal rest . In the closing years of his life he was an old and very sick man and frequently expressed a wish to sleep forever . We emphatically do not intend to subject his body to the dubious techniques of the so-called reanimators currently making big headlines . " Harker looked up . " Listen to this garbage , Lois ! " He read her the story , bearing down with sardonic malice on Jonathan 's more pointed remarks . " Talk about setting up straw men ! Who offered to bring his father back to life in the first place ? He 's turning down something that could n't ever have been possible . If the medics were n't able to keep Rick Bryant alive , the Beller process is n't going to be able to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's just trying to stir up trouble for me , nothing else . " " Suppose he does n't know it , though ? Suppose he thinks the process really can bring his father back to life ? " " I wonder . He 's smart enough to know that there has to be some limit on the abilities of the technique . Well , you can bet they 'll rush him off to a crematorium in a hurry now , before any further talk of reviving him gets around . They waited four years for him to die , and they 'd be damned before they 'd let him be brought back to haunt them ! " The phone rang again . Lois answered it ; Harker busied himself with the newspapers . In a moment she said , " It 's Monsignor Carteret . He 's very anxious to talk to you . Urgent , he says . What should I tell him ? " " I 'll talk to him . " He picked it up in the foyer , where the phone was audio only . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong , " he said . " The way your process was announced ? that is n't how I thought you were going to handle it . " " I know . Some knucklehead sprang the story prematurely , and we 're stuck with the consequences . " " I thought I 'd let you know that ecclesiastical circles are in a dither , " Carteret said . " Non-stop meetings going on . The Cardinal 's been on the phone to Rome half the day . " Harker 's throat tightened . " How does it look ? " " Not good , from your point of view . The Vatican is going to issue a hands-off order : no Catholic is to go near your process in any way whatever until the Church has had ample time to explore the implications . Which could mean a few months or a few centuries ; there 's no telling . " " So it 's a condemnation , then ? " " Pretty much so , " Carteret agreed softly . " Until it 's been determined whether or not reanimation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his family to be reanimated  --  or even work in your laboratories . Of course , it 's the sort of decree that 's likely to be widely ignored , the way the old birth-84  | control teachings were , by a lot of churchgoers . Still , it 's bound to hurt you , Jim . " " I realize that . It 'll hurt us even outside Catholicism . " " I 've thought of that , " said Carteret . " The Protestant sects that sometimes try to be holier than the Pope  --  if Rome does n't trust the process , the Fundamentalists are sure to want to smash it altogether . And so on . I hope everything works out for you , Jim , despite this . There 's nothing you can do now but stick to your guns and pray for enlightenment , is there ? " " No , " Harker said . " I guess not . " He thanked the priest for the advance information and hung up . Storm clouds were beginning to gather already . Yet , much to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gloom and desperation had washed away . He knew why . The battle had been joined . No more behind-the-scenes skulking ; no more furtive drawing up of possible strategies . He was out in the open as the standardbearer of Beller Labs . It promised to be a rugged fight , but that did n't particularly frighten him . " So now I get my second chance , " he said to Lois . " I do n't understand , Jim . " " I was elected Governor of New York on a reform platform that nobody in the party organization took seriously except me . I waded in and started to restructure things , and I got my teeth rammed down my throat for trying . Okay . I lost the first round . But now I 'm in the thick of the fight again , fighting against fear and ignorance and hysteria and reaction . Maybe I 'll lose again  --  but at least I 'll have given it another good try . " She touched his arm almost timidly . Harker realized that he had never really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , the caution , the timidity , and the core of toughness that was there , too . " This time you 'll win , Jim , " she said simply . It did n't look that way in the morning . THURMAN SPEARHEADS REANIMATION INQUIRY , 85  | the Times announced , and the story revealed that Senator Clyde Thurman ( N-L , N.Y. ) had urged an immediate Congressional investigation of the claims of the Beller Research Laboratories . From the tone of Thurman 's statements it was obvious that he was bitterly hostile to the whole idea of reanimation . " Possibly a menace to the basic fabric of an orderly society , " was one of the things he had said about the process . " Possibly an unwarranted human intrusion into a domain rightfully that of the Deity , " was another . The Times also printed a full page of extracts from editorials of other newspapers throughout the country , plus a few comments from overseas journals that had arrived in time to be quoted in the early editions . The prevailing newspaper sentiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The East Coast papers , regardless of their political orientation or their outlook on scientific progress , generally suggested that careful scrutiny be applied to the alleged achievement of Beller Labs before such a process went into use on any wide scale . Some thought the process was the work of Satan , others thought it might be the greatest boon since anesthesia , but nearly everyone wanted more checking done . The Far West papers were somewhat more adventurous , calling also for immediate scientific examination of the Beller claims but implying that humanity stood at the brink of a wondrous new era . The Midwest papers , though , took a different approach in general . A typical response was that of the Chicago Tribune , which after the standard **32;453;TOOLONG temporizing , went on to say , " We fear that this supposed new advance of science may instead be a gigantic step backward , that it may sound the trumpet call for the decline and collapse of civilization as we know it . A society without the fear of death is one without the fear of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own hands , giving full rein to his most arrogant dreams . " And so on , with quotes from Sartre , Kierkegaard , Mailer , Dostoievski , and other characters not normally quoted in the Chicago Tribune , for nearly a full column . 86  | The overseas notices were mixed : the Manchester Guardian offered cautious approval , the London Daily Mirror a volley of ringing condemnation . From France came puzzled , half-hostile admiration for this latest demonstration of American scientific prowess ; the Germans applauded the discovery lustily and asked for the formula ; the Russians and Chinese were silent at the moment , and the leading African powers seemed to have taken little notice . The Vatican promised a statement shortly , but L'Osservatore Romano kindly provided a prediction of what the Pope 's position was likely to be . It was about what Carteret had said . Harker reached the Litchfield headquarters at a quarter to ten that morning . There was the now-customary gaggle of newsmen cluttering up the highway , even though the skies were dark with the promise of imminent rain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the approach to the laboratory grounds themselves , and so Harker had no difficulty getting past the gantlet of reporters and into the central area . Raymond and Lurie were in the office when Harker got there . They had a huge array of newspapers spread out all over the floor , and Lurie was taking clippings . " Makes interesting reading , " Harker said amiably . Raymond looked up . " We never expected this , Jim . We never expected anything like this . " Harker shrugged . " Death is the most important word in the language , right after birth . What comes between is irrelevant and immaterial , just the filler in the sandwich ; everybody goes through his days trying hard not to think that his whole life is just a preparation for the moment of his death . You 've changed all that . You 've punched mankind 's most powerful button . Did you expect the world to take it calmly ? " Lurie said , " Show him the letters , Mart . " Raymond shoved a thick file folder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will you ? It 's enough to break your heart . " " They come in truckloads , " Lurie said . " The Litchfield  | postmaster is running deliveries down to us once an hour because he does n't have room to store the stuff up there . He says that if it keeps up we 'll have to pick it up ourselves . " Harker reached into the folder and pulled out a letter at random . It was written painstakingly in a tight , cramped , upright hand on blue-lined yellow paper . Dear Sirs , You will probably throw this letter in the wastebasket but I beg you to consider it sincerely . My wife age 29 who is the mother of our four small children is sick in the hospital in great pain with cancer , there is an intestinal obstruction at several points that can not be operated and the Dr. says she will not live more ' than 1 more week . We have all been praying for her both at her church and mine which for family reasons have always been two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well has been gradually sinking all month and does not now recognize us or seem to anyway . I read of your miracle discovery in this morning 's newspaper and hope now you can bring my Lucy back to life when she is gone . I enclose a self-addressed envelope with a stamp so you can let me know if such would be possible , I will immediately upon her death bring her to you so you can give her back to us . I speak for our children Charles age 6 Peggy age 4 Clara age almost 3 and Betsy age fourteen months , they are good children and deserve to have their Mother to guide them . May God bless all of you and keep you from suffering what I have been suffering , and I will live in hope of hearing from you . Yours gratefully , Charles Mikkelsen R.F.D. ? i , Delaware , Minne . Overwhelmed by a curious sense of bitter compassion , Harker put the letter down . Raymond said , " We have hundreds like that . Thousands , maybe : we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the damnedest things you could imagine , too . People with 88  | relatives dead ten years want to dig them up and bring them to us . " Harker shook his head . " We 'll have to find some way of making clear to everybody where the limits of the process lie . How about this Mikkelsen woman ? Is there any chance you could help her ? " " The cancer case ? Not a prayer . If it 's as bad as he says it is , the malignancy has probably metastatized right up and down her intestinal tract by now , and beyond it into every corner of her body . Maybe we could bring her back to life , but we could n't keep her alive afterward , not if she 's one quivering mass of carcinoma . " " I see . How about other diseases ? " Raymond shrugged . " If the organic damage is beyond repair , we ca n't do a thing . We can help the electrocution cases , the drownings , a lot of stroke cases , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died because it had ceased to be viable , because it had simply come apart , there is n't much we can do . What good 's bringing this woman back to life if she 's full of cancer from her eyeballs to her spleen ? She ca n't live . She ca n't sustain the life processes on her own , and as a matter of fact we ca n't even sustain them for her with present-day life-support techniques . And we ca n't rebuild a body that 's undergone so much destruction . On the other hand , if repair is possible , you can figure a good chance of success . Take a patient with cardiac tissue scarred by repeated attacks . One more attack will finish him  --  and so will a hearttransplant operation , because he 'd never withstand the shock of surgery . But now we can kill ' him , do the transplant , and reanimate . He could live another thirty years that way . " " In other words ? " The phone rang . Raymond swiveled around and scooped it lightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long moment , frowning ever more deeply , and finally said , " Yes . Yes , I get you . No , we wo n't make any concessions . Go ahead , then . Sue , if that 's what you feel like doing . We 'll countersue and wipe you out . " 89  | He hung up . " What the blazes was that ? " Harker demanded . " Do you know a lawyer named Phil Gerhardt ? " " Sure . He 's an ambulance chaser . He 's all flash and bluster , about as honest as snow in the Sahara . What about him ? " " He just called , " Raymond said . " Seems he 's representing Mitchison and Klaus . They are n't happy about their dismissal notices and they 're suing for a million bucks . Gerhardt is sending the formal letter over today , but he thought he 'd try an informal approach first . He was offering to call off the suit if I 'd resign and put Mitchison and Klaus in control of the labs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the phone number of Gerhardt 's New York office , called , bulled his way past a screen of clerks and secretaries and spoke briefly with the lawyer . His last dealings with Gerhardt had come during his second year as Governor , when Gerhardt had represented a taxpayer group trying to get the state 's medical insurance program overthrown as unconstitutional . It had n't been pleasant to deal with him then , and it was n't now . Gerhardt seemed almost offensively exuberant , bubbling with confidence , gloating as he informed Harker that his offer to Raymond , having been rejected , would not be renewed . His clients now were asking both for a million in punitive damages and control of the laboratory . It was only a matter of days , Gerhardt said , before the court tossed Raymond and Harker out of command at Beller Labs and reinstated Klaus and Mitchison . Harker asked for a chance to confer with the two ousted employees ; this , of course , was refused . Gerhardt sounded like a man who was holding all the trumps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll prepare a countersuit against your clients on grounds of malfeasance , insubordination , theft of petty cash and postage stamps , and half a dozen  | other things , I do n't mind fighting , Gerhardt . Especially with you. , , He broke off the call . This was an additional nuisance ; things seemed to be growing needlessly more complex by the moment . There was a special twist to this one : Gerhardt was a prominent member of the American Conservative Party 's national committee , an apostle of the far right who was willing to lead any doomed cause at all for the sake of harassing those who were conspiring to destroy the American way of life . Harker could see the battle lines beginning to form ? with Klaus and Mitchison , Gerhardt , the American-Conservatives , the organized churches , Jonathan Bryant , and Senator Thurman linked in unlikely alliance on one side , and , at the moment , nobody but Harker , Raymond and the staff of Beller Labs on the other . It was turning into a crusade . During the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone rang constantly ; the media people down the road never tired of making sallies into the roped-off area , hoping to cadge an interview ; from time to time a convoy of mail trucks arrived with bales of letters . Harker found it necessary to clear out one of the less important laboratories to store them . " Have a couple of men start going through them , " he told Lurie . The gangling biologist had slipped easily into the role of messenger boy and general go-between . " I want all the letters pleading for revivification of long-dead relatives destroyed immediately . Likewise the ones asking for miracles we ca n't perform , like the cancer business . Do n't just throw them away : destroy them . " " How about the abusive ones ? " " Save those , " Harker said . " It helps to know who our enemies are , " The afternoon papers again devoted much of their frontpage space to the story , and the Times in addition ran a well-handled four-page symposium in which a number of distinguished scientists discussed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Harker skimmed  | through it rapidly , finding little to disturb him until he came upon a comment by Dr. Louis F. Santangelo of Johns Hopkins . He read it aloud to Raymond : There is the distinct possibility that death causes irremediable injury to the brain , quite apart from the ordinary organic damage that all bodily tissues suffer once the cessation of vital functions deprives them of oxygen . So far the Beller researchers have been distressingly silent on the subject of the mental aftereffects of reanimation . I think we must give serious consideration to the possibility that the process may well produce living but virtually mindless bodies  --  in short , walking corpses , or the zombies of legend . " Who 's this man Santangelo ? " Harker asked . Raymond looked up , troubled . " A neurosurgeon , and a good one . Too damned good , Jim . He 's right on the nose . " " Thank God the quote is buried in all these endless columns of gray type , " Harker said . " It 's a potential bombshell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; for another it puts the zombie ' stigma on us again , this time out of the mouth of a reputable scientist . Let 's hope no one notices . " He reached for a fresh sheet of paper . " Mart , give me the figures on human reanimations so far , will you ? " " To date , seventy-one attempts . Successful resuscitation in sixty-seven cases . " " Fine . And how many of your sixty-seven suffered no mental aftereffects ? " " Sixty-one , " Raymond said . " Which leaves six zombies . " Harker felt a sudden chill . In these frenzied first few days , he had had no time to learn some of the most vital information about this operation , and now he feared ugly discoveries lay ahead . " What did you do with those six ? " he asked . " What could we do ? We gave them an injection and returned them to the source . It was the merciful thing to do ? and it 's no crime to kill someone who 's already been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet , " Harker said . " Where 'd you get your seventyone subjects ? " Raymond looked evasive . " Locally , here and there . We got a few from a hospital in Jersey City where we have some connections . Municipal hospital . Drifters , public charges , forgotten men with no known relatives . That 's where we got the man you saw revived . They call us when there 's a possibility . Some subjects came from auto accidents in the neighborhood . Medical supply houses , too . Oh , we scrounge around . Three of our subjects were laboratory staff members who died of natural causes . " " And where are your sixty-one successful revivees right now ? " Harker asked . " It 's all in the record . Twelve of them are in various hospitals , recuperating . Death really smashes up the nervous system , you know . It often takes two or three months or more to make a full recovery , we 've found . Twenty have returned to normal life . Six of these do n't even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch over them . " " And the rest ? " " The most recent ones are still on the premises , in Lab B. I guess I did n't get a chance to show you the ward . " " I guess you did n't , " Harker said . " Somehow . Well , we 're going to have to issue a general report on your experiments so far . Not a technical report : a public statement . Get Vogel and Smathers to write it up , and I 'll revise it into releasable form . We ? " " The technical report should come first , actually . We 've been working up a major paper for Science , figuring that 'll get us our largest professional audience . " " How long will it take you to finish it , and then for them to get it into print ? " " Eight or ten months , I suppose . We 've got most of the raw data ready already . I 'm not sure how long they need to publish something these days , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten days , Mart . Forget the professional protocol and get the public report out first . Put  | Vogel and Smathers on it this afternoon . Tell them not to say anything about the six idiots . But it 's okay if they mention the fact that four of the cadavers could n't be revived . " Vogel delivered the first draft of the statistical summary about three hours later . Harker read it through once , scrawled a few changes on it , and began to retype it . In his version the piece acquired a prologue stressing the fact that many of the reanimatees had returned to normal life . He failed to point out that six of the subjects had had to be destroyed because their revivals had been faulty . The release was Xeroxed and was ready in time for his daily afternoon press conference . Times said , " Could we have the names and addresses of the successful revivifications ? " " Absolutely impossible . A matter of medical ethics . They 're entitled to privacy . " " When was the first successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Raymond , who said , " Exactly ten months ago . To be precise , it was at half past three in the afternoon on Tuesday , July 17 , last year . Dr. Vogel operated . " " What was the patient 's name ? " United Press International shot out quickly . Harker laughed . " Good try , but no score . Subjects ' names will not be revealed . Repeat : not . " " How many unsuccessful attempts were there before the July 17 success ? " Times wanted to know . " I do n't have the exact figure , " Harker said , realizing Raymond had neglected to give it to him . That **29;487;TOOLONG ? attempts record  --  that represented the results since the initial success , Harker suddenly realized . But prior to that ? " Mart , what would you say ? About ? ? " He hesitated . Raymond caught the hint and said smoothly , " I 'd estimate approximately thirty unsuccessful attempts over a period of about two years . "  | " And there have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Right . With sixty-seven reanimations . " " All of them completely successful ? " the sharp Times man demanded . Harker looked studiedly vague . " Varying degrees of success , " he replied . He had n't called on his skills of ambiguity so much since his days in City Hall . " Would you care to elaborate on that statement , Mr. Harker ? " " Not just now , " he said , presenting the most guileless expression he could muster to the cameras . The Scripps-Howard-Cauldwell woman said , " As you know , Senator Thurman is pressing for a full-scale Senate investigation of this laboratory and its findings . Would you welcome such an investigation ? " " If it 's conducted fairly and without prejudice , " Harker said , " of course we 'd welcome it . We 're not trying to fool anybody . We 've discovered something marvelous and we want the people of the world to share in it . " " How do you feel about the American-Conservative Party 's stand on reanimation ? " Times asked . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They issued a statement at national headquarters about one this afternoon . It warns that the Beller process is untried and full of potential perils , and suggests that the National-Liberal Party is going to try to exploit the discovery for its own personal advantage , ramming it down the public 's throats without proper safeguards . The statement points to your presence as legal adviser as proof of the Nat-Lib complicity . " Harker managed a bland smile , though a surge of fury was passing through him . He said carefully , " This comes as a big surprise to me , and , frankly , I do n't understand why the American-Conservatives have chosen to resort to smear tactics so quickly . There 's no political texture to this process . The people here are scientists , not politicians , and my own  | connection with this laboratory is purely a matter of my private career . I do n't have any formal affiliation with the National-Liberals these days except as a registered voter . I 'm not even a member of the state committee , let alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encouragement or anything else from the Nat-Libs . The American-Conservative charges are pure political paranoia . That 's nothing new , of course . " " But you were a former Nat-Lib Governor , Mr. Harker . Does n't that make you a major figure in the party hierarchy ? " Scripps-Howard-Cauldwell asked . Harker glared straight into the eye of the video camera and said , " I still vote Nat-Lib , if that 's what you mean , and I generally support the Nat-Lib program . But I 'm out of politics . I 'm only an ex-Governor , period . " " Another point , Mr. Harker , " NBC asked with a sly smile . " How about the claim of Cal Mitchison and David Klaus that there have been unethical practices in this lab ? " " Can you be more specific ? " " Surely you know that Klaus and Mitchison have filed suit against the Beller operation , claiming mismanagement , suppression of experimental findings , distortion of ? " Harker said , " I hardly think that 's worth talking about . Mitchison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and were discharged . It 's as simple as that . When the suit reaches the courts we expect to show that their accusations have no basis in reality . " " You were the lawyer for the late Richard Bryant , " said the Times man . " What part did you play in the attempt to use the Beller process to reanimate Mr. Bryant ? " " None , " Harker said . " There was no such attempt . As I understand the medical background of Mr. Bryant 's case , it would have been hopeless to try a reanimation . In any event , the Bryant family issued a statement expressing no desire to have him returned to life , and at no time did anyone in this organization suggest that such an attempt should be made . The talk of reviving Richard Bryant was strictly un-  | official , a street rumor , born out of the fact that his death and our process were made public more or less simultaneously . " Harker paused , wondering if he had not begun to overstress the argument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replies , a sure sign that he was wearying under the barrage of perilous questions . The conference had been going on for more than half an hour . He felt wrung dry . " Unless there are any other very urgent questions , " he said , " I 'll have to ask that ? " Times said , " One more question , Mr. Harker . Have any reanimation taken place since the announcement of the process yesterday morning ? " " No . Until the legal status of reanimation is settled , we 're not proceeding with further experiments on human beings " ? he regretted the unfortunate word experiments as soon as it passed his lips ? " although we 're continuing with other phases of our research . We 've been bombarded with requests for reanimations , but we do n't intend to attempt any . Obviously a legal decision on the validity of our process is needed first . The death-certificate laws , for instance ; they 'll have to be considered . What 's the status of someone who 's been dead eight or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back ? What protection is he entitled to under the law during his period of  --  ah  --  absence ? You see the scope of the problems . Until they 're resolved , we 'll remain inactive . Well , gentlemen , I think our time is just about up . " The fearsome blaze of the cameras died away ; the media representatives hurried from the room . Harker slumped into his seat . Mart Raymond said , " I do n't know how you do it , Jim . Stand up to those eagles , I mean . The pressure does n't let up for a second . " " I 've had a lot of practice , " Harker said with forced casualness . His stomach felt knotted ; his throat seemed to be covered with hundreds of small blisters . His legs were quivering . But gradually he recovered his poise . The press conference had been a sort of purge , letting him expel all  | sorts of poisonous fears that had been boiling within him all day . The main battle , he now saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to secure Congressional approval for the process . And they had to win friends and influence people in a hurry , before the various splintered opponents of reanimation , of the Beller Labs , and of James Harker could join forces and provide a united front . That could force the issue into the courts , where it might take years to decide . Federal legislation , that was the only way . And if they failed to get the law they sought ? If Congress decided that this was a matter for local legislatures , or left it to the courts , or actually voted to ban reanimation ? No doubt the technique would survive , no matter what the legal decision might be . But it would become an underground activity , furtive and shady , as abortion had been before the permissive laws of the late twentieth century . And underground meant dangerous . Illegal equated with deadly . The tools of medicine are always deadly in unskilled hands . No doubt about it , the fight was on . It was , Harker thought the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it craved , despite the obstacles set up by fear , greed , and ignorance . Who could oppose the conquest of death ? Why , anyone could , once the essential miracle had been clouded over by half-truths , distortions , and the sincere fanaticism of self-righteous pressure groups . The historical record was uninspiring . They had fought vaccination , anesthesia , blood transfusions , quarantine laws , public-health clinics , mental-health programs  --  all part of the conspiracy , all violations of mankind 's God-given right to suffer . Women had been compelled to bear children against their wills . Why ? Why ? Idiots had gone free to reproduce . Children had been left to die unattended . And now , if the same forces had their way , there would be no reprieve from death . No , Harker thought . I 'm going to fight you . To the finish .  | The next morning  --  Wednesday  --  Harker found a neatly typed note on his desk when he reached his Dormitory A office . It was from Mart Raymond : We got a call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is on its way north to inspect the lab . Armed with subpoenas . Arriving noontime . Harker crumpled the note and turned his attention methodically to the morning papers . He felt tense , but not unduly so ; the Senatorial investigation did not have to be an ordeal . Thurman was conservative , but not unreasonable ; if he could be won over during his visit , the investigation could be the beginning of the success of their campaign . In any event , it would put an end to these days of doubt . On this , the third morning of the Era of Reanimation , the topic was slathered generously across much of the front page of nearly every paper . His press conference was the main item of fresh news , and , as customary , the Times had printed the full text . He read it through fearful of finding some terrible gaffe . But no : he felt he had held his own reasonably well . The other articles , though , left him with a queasy sense of expanding confusion . MANHATTAN  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotion-filled ceremony , despite a noisy demonstration in favor of the space hero 's reanimation . Nearly a hundred slogan-chanting demonstrators , most of them middle-aged , attempted to interfere with the ceremony , but police maintained order . " We are sure Father would never have approved of such an unnatural awakening , " declared Jonathan Bryant , 53 , eldest son of the Mars pilot . . . MONTREAL ( UPI ) ? A screaming mob destroyed the home and office of Dr. Joseph Pronovost this afternoon  | after he refused to resuscitate a 9-year-old girl who had died the night before . Dr. Pronovost , 58 , an internist who has practiced for thirty years in the same lower-middleclass metropolitan neighborhood , claimed to have no knowledge of the Beller reanimation technique announced Monday . Despite his statement , relatives and friends of Nancy St. Leger , a victim of leukemia , broke into the doctor 's home and attacked him . Dr. Pronovost was reported to be in good condition at Sacred Heart Hospital , but .. . CORPUS CHRISTI , Tex . ( AP ) ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following a rumor that a Beller reanimation was taking place at a local funeral home . Police announced that more than thirty persons invaded the Burr Funeral Parlors in an attempt to prevent the alleged reanimation . A funeral service was in progress , and shots were fired as the guests turned back the intruders , resulting in minor wounds to three people . In the fighting that ensued .. . So the madness was beginning already . Dark forces were being unleashed . The other newspapers carried more stories of the same sort : violence on both sides of the controversy , angry and ill-informed people trying to prevent reanimations here , have them performed there . And these , Harker knew , were mere harbingers of what was to come . The fabric of society had been unbound ; anything might happen now . Gloomily Harker pushed the papers aside . At twenty minutes to twelve , Benedict Lurie stuck his head in Harker 's doorway and said , " A helicopter full of Senators just landed outside . Raymond 's talking to them . " " How many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the copter . I could n't tell you how many of them are politicians . " " I 'll be right out , " Harker said . He filed away the newspapers , cleaned his desk , and self-consciously straightened his clothing before he went  | outside . A little group stood in the clearing formed by the area between the three main buildings . Harker saw Mart Raymond , Vogel , Barchet and Dr. Smathers . And Senator Clyde Thurman . Harker walked over . Thurman , turning first , stared at Harker glintingly and rumbled , " Ah  --  Harker . Hello , there . " " How are you , Senator ? " " Never better . Do you know these men , Harker ? Senator Brewster of Iowa , Vorys of South Carolina , Dixon of Wyoming , Westmore of California . Gentlemen , of course you know Mr. Harker , former Governor of New York . " Harker shook hands all around . He knew most of the Senators at least casually ; Dixon and Westmore were leaders of the Far West branch of the Nat-Libs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chairman of the committee and would have the deciding vote in case of a tie . Harker felt apprehensive about that . The venerable Senator was ostensibly a Nat-Lib ; at least he was elected every six years under that label . But he had never been in the mainstream of the NatLib philosophy , and in the past decade he had been trending increasingly toward conservative ways of thinking , drifting away from the spirit of the party he had helped to found decades earlier on the ruins of the two old parties . Each of the Senators was accompanied by an aide . That made ten in all . A couple of the aides looked more intelligent and dignified and senatorial than their bosses . Nothing unusual about that , Harker thought . Thurman said , " The hearings are due to begin next week , Harker . We 're here for a preliminary look-see , nothing more . " " Of course . " Harker glanced at Raymond and said to Thurman , " Dr. Raymond is the director of the labs . He 'll conduct you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worried . Harker had seen the lab director 's face taking on an increasingly harried expression in the previous few days . That troubled Harker . Raymond  | was a good organizer , a levelheaded leader  --  but he was showing alarming signs of crumbling under the sudden pressure exerted by Mitchison 's treacherous press release . Harker edged close to him and murmured , " What 's on schedule for the Senators ? " Tightly Raymond replied , " The main event 's a cadaver . " " You 're going to risk it ? " " We 'll have to do it sooner or later . Why not now ? " Harker made no reply . Attempting a human reanimation in front of the senatorial committee was a long-shot gamble , even with odds of five to one in favor of success . If the experiment succeeded , they would have gained very little ; if it failed , they would have lost everything right at the outset . Those odds of five to one were deceptive . But Harker decided to risk it . He said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had evidently been working frantically all morning to set things up . The labs were spotless , everything well ordered and well dusted . The researchers must have been warned of what was up , too : every one of them looked Constructively Busy , doing something that seemed scientific no matter how trivial . On ordinary days , most of them spent a good half their time staring into space , making doodles on scraps of paper , or thumbing randomly through reference books  --  but Senators could never be expected to believe that such idleness could be an important part of the process of research . The tour began with a rapid and no doubt deliberately exhausting general survey of the labs , much like the one Raymond had given Harker . Raymond served again as guide , emitting bristling scientific terminology in a steady flow . Even Harker knew enough by now to realize that much of what he was saying was little more than gibberish ; but the Senators looked impressed . They also looked increasingly weary  --  all except Thurman , who strode jauntily along at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inexhaustible series of questions , some of them pointless , others embarrassingly perceptive . As he struggled to keep pace with Thurman , Harker felt a surge of new admiration for the Nat-Lib patriarch . Thurman was a ruggedly built man , well over six feet tall and still erect of bearing ; his face was a craggy affair dominated by massive snowy-white eyebrows and a properly senatorial thatch of silver hair , and his voice was a commanding rumble . It was Thurman who had helped to complete the destruction of the old Democratic and Republican parties by serving as one of the organizers of the ecumenical NationalLiberal Party that had carried the 1990 Congressional elections ; he had then been among those who persuaded the incumbent President Morrison to run for re-election on the Nat-Lib ticket , rather than accept the nomination of the moribund Democrats , in ' 9z-and , by ' 94 , the obsolete political parties had vanished , replaced by a more logical alignment of liberal against conservative . Now , Harker saw , the party lines were blurring again ; perhaps some inevitable political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restless liberals within the American-Conservatives , and some of the older Nat-Libs , especially Thurman , were with increasing regularity voting for Conservative-sponsored measures . Perhaps in another fifty years ' time another reorganization would be needed ; history seemed to show that such shuffles were necessary about once every century . As the delegation from Washington explored the enzyme lab and watched the big centrifuge at work in the serotonin room , Harker wondered where he stood with Thurman now . Fifteen years before , he had virtually been a son to the Senator , serving for a while as his private secretary before being tapped for prominence in the New York Nat-Lib organization . Thurman had guided him up through the mayoralty , had seen him into the Governor 's mansion in Albany , had talked seriously with him about his presidential  | hopes . But all that seemed terribly long ago . When the party had decided to ostracize Harker , Thurman had conspicuously failed to come to his defense . It was more than a year since Harker had had any contact with the old Senator . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Vogel began to demonstrate reanimation on a pair of spaniels ? " they feel no pain ? " Vorys was a waspish , bald little man , with what seemed like a lifetime tenure as American-Conservative Senator from South Carolina . " Absolutely none , " Raymond assured him . " Animal experiments are legal , " remarked Senator Westmore , the California Nat-Lib . " No grounds for objecting there . " " I was n't objecting , " snapped Vorys . " Merely inquiring . " The dogs were cleared away , resuscitated , in due time . The proceedings had plainly had a powerful impact on the visitors . But Harker saw that Raymond looked more tense than ever : the main event was about to begin . In a thin , strained voice , Raymond said , " Gentlemen , I know you 've come here for one main purpose  --  to see if human life can be restored . The time has come for us to demonstrate that we have that capability . " The Senators stirred , exchanged glances , made blatant efforts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scribbled notes . Harker felt dry fingers clutching at his windpipe . It was a sensation he remembered having felt on two election nights , at that bleak moment just after the polls had closed  --  when , with the die irretrievably cast , there was nothing to do but wait until the computers had done their counting job and announced the winner . Two white-smocked assistants rolled in an operating table . A covered cadaver lay on it . Raymond said , sounding harsh and edgy , " We secure most of our experimental cadavers from local hospitals , under long-standing agreements approved by the county medical officials . The body on this table is approximately  | the one hundredth we have used in our work , and the seventy-second since our first successful reanimation . " The covers were peeled back . Harker flinched . The body was that of a boy , twelve or thirteen years old , slender , dark-haired . In its present condition it was n't a pretty sight . " This boy drowned late yesterday afternoon when his canoe overturned in a lake about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All conventional methods of resuscitation were tried without success . " " You mean artificial respiration , heart massage and things like that ? " Senator Dixon asked . " Yes . The body was recovered soon after the accident , and the boy was worked over for nearly eight hours , first at the lake and then at the hospital . He was pronounced dead early this morning . When I phoned the hospital to arrange for a demonstration specimen for you gentlemen , I was allowed to speak to the boy 's father , who gave permission for this experiment . The final papers were signed just before you arrived . " Five minirecorders on five secretarial wrists drank in Raymond 's words . Harker felt tension rising . Still , he had to admit that using a boy for the experiment was a good touch . The sympathies of the Senators would certainly be engaged , where they might not have been had the subject been some seedy derelict . But again there was a great risk : if the experiment failed , the letdown would be all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failure ; that could always be explained away and accepted with tolerance . No one had ever claimed that the process would succeed every time . It was that one-out-of-six chance that frightened Harker , the worse-than-failure of restoring the boy 's body and not his mind . Raymond nodded to Vogel , who again was presiding over the reanimation . The bearded surgeon clamped the electrodes to the boy 's temples and wrists , and lowered the great hooded bulk of the reanimator.  | " The body has been undergoing preparation for the past hour , " Raymond said . " Chemical balances have been adjusted and catabolic products have been drained . The initial attack now will come simultaneously through the electrodes and through hormone injections . Heart massage will follow , and also artificial operation of the lungs , until a self-sustaining level has been reached . At the same time , we 'll be monitoring for possible brain damage and inducing repairs . Keep your eyes on these instruments ; they measure heartbeat , respiration , and the electrical activity of the brain . " The room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confidently , with no visible sign of tension . Harker understood why he was always chosen to give the demonstrations : either he had no nerves , or he was a marvelous actor . Vogel threw three switches , in big dramatic gestures , swoosh swoosh swoosh . The archaic light bulbs overhead dimmed slightly at the instant of power drain . Driblets of sweat rolled icily down Harker 's face . The five Senators , ringed in a semicircle , stood as if frozen , staring intently into the machinery . He wondered what they were thinking now , how they were reacting as electrical currents rippled through a dead brain and chemical messengers coursed through a stilled bloodstream . The boy was dwarfed by the hovering instrument that clung to his exposed heart , pumped his lungs , jolted his brain , fed awakening substances to his arteries . The needles on the indicator gauges began to flicker gently . Harker felt none of the revulsion , none of the subliminal terror , that watching the other reanimation had aroused in him . Now he stared at the slim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blue imprint of asphyxiation , and waited calmly for the miracle to take place . Minutes passed . Once Thurman coughed , and it was like a physical blow . Needles rose on dials , wavered , fell back as Vogel decreased power , climbed again as the delicate fingers nudged the rheostat upward a few fractions of an inch .  | " Watch the EEG readings , " Vogel murmured . The needle was tracing out an increasingly more agitated line . The calmness of sleep was ending . " Respiration approaching normal . I 'm shutting off the lung manipulators . " The heart pump followed . As though he were conducting a symphony , Vogel reached here , there , yanking down on toggle switches , tapping control plates , finally drawing the main rheostat back to point zero . " Artificial controls are withdrawn , " Vogel announced . " The life processes continue . " The boy lived . Raymond said quietly to Harker , " The vital signs are on target . The EEG patterns are normal ones . The boy 's mind is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Harker felt a sharp sense of triumph , as though he personally had accomplished something . A vicarious thrill of unearned glory , but a thrill nevertheless . How could the Senators fail to react favorably to something like this ? A dead boy restored ? An unfinished life , interrupted too soon , now to be resumed ? He glanced at Thurman , eager for the accolade , the surrender , the embrace . The old man was gray-faced , disturbed , shaken . Harker saw nothing surprising in that . This process was powerful stuff . He said quietly , " Well , Senator ? You 've just seen a miracle . " He was n't prepared for the reply . Thurman shook his great head slowly from side to side like a dying bison and said somberly , " Jim , this is nightmarish . In the name of all that 's good , boy , what possessed you to get mixed up in it ? " TWELVE Two hours later , the Senate committee had gone , but the gloom of their presence still hovered darkly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do with the visit of the Senators had struck him . The old wounds of that day at the beach were open once again ; once again he huddled Eva 's cold little form against his .  | Somewhere else on the laboratory grounds , surgeons were working over a twelve-year-old boy , stitching together the surgical wounds that had been made to permit resuscitation . By tomorrow the boy would be out of anesthesia . In a few weeks , he would be walking around , healthy , regaining his strength , wondrously recalled to life after twenty hours of death . Eva had drowned . No one had been able to save her then . " I do n't understand it , " Mart Raymond said vehemently . " It does n't make any sense . " Drawn for a moment from his painful memories , Harker said , " What does n't ? " " Thurman 's reaction . How can he stand there and watch a dead boy come back to life , and end up twice as strongly against us as he was before ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought that show would win them over for sure . And then Thurman spoke up . The old man 's gone senile , I guess . He 's clutching some kind of nineteenth-century idea that it 's immoral to flout God 's will by reviving the dead , I think , and having it done right in front of him just solidified his thinking . " Raymond said , " Thurman 's supposed to be a Nat-Lib . Forward-looking , progressive . I could understand those two Conservatives denouncing us , but I thought ? " " Yeah . So did I. But Thurman 's an old man . " " The Conservatives came out against reanimation today , did n't they ? Does n't he realize he 's helping the opposition if he fights us ? " " Maybe he does n't think of them as opposition any more , " Harker said . " He was a Republican once . Perhaps he 's begun to wonder if he made the wrong choice when the realignment of parties happened . Hell , he 's eighty-eight years old . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what 's happened inside his head . " Raymond sagged . The strain was showing on him . His eyes were red-rimmed and bleary ; his face had grown haggard . He had given up a comfortable career in medical research  | to handle the job of running Keller Labs , and , Harker thought , perhaps he was regretting that now . " If Thurman votes against us , " Raymond said " we 're finished . How can we win him over ? " " The hearings begin next Monday . We 've got four days to figure out a line of attack . I 'll come up with something . Look , for all we know he 'll drop dead before Monday . " Harker was astonished by the words as they came from him . The thought of a universe without Clyde Thurman in it was a mind-shaking concept . And the ease with which he had wished Thurman dead shook him deeply . He wished he could call back what he had said . He looked at his watch . Five minutes to three . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Everything 's ready for the press conference , Jim . " Leadenly Harker nodded . " Okay . Send them , in . " He ran through what he had to say in less than half an hour . He told them that the senatorial committee had come and had watched the successful reanimation of a twelveyear-old drowned boy . He expressed a hope that the demonstration had impressed the Senators favorably , and made no mention of Thurman 's comment at the end . There was a brief session of sporadic questions ; then , pleading exhaustion , Harker hustled the newsmen out . He felt tremendously weary , but at the same time he was buoyed by the excitement of knowing he was in a fight , and a tough fight . He phoned Lois and said he would be home in time for dinner . Whenever , she told him . She was being co-operative beyond the call of wifely duty , he thought . He was hardly ever home these days , and when he did show up he was a pale ghost of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy to meet the needs of family life . Yet she made no protest . The evening papers came in about half past four . Harker was busy preparing a plan of attack for the following  | week 's Senate hearings ; he looked up , startled , when Lurie dropped the stack on his desk . Most of the papers carried a statement from Mitchison and Klaus , released via their lawyer , to the effect that the Beller Laboratories were in the hands of power-hungry madmen who should be stripped of control immediately , pro Bono publico . " I wonder what they hope to gain by tactics like that , " Raymond asked . " Even if they do succeed in getting control of the labs , they 'll have thoroughly loused up the whole idea of reanimation by painting it as a mad-scientist operation . " " We 'll shut them , up soon enough , " Harker said . " I 've had word from Gerhardt that he 's ready to serve papers on us . And then we file our countersuit . " " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bryant case . When 's the hearing on that ? " " Tomorrow . I 'll be tied up with that all day , I guess . But then I 'll be free to devote full time here . " Harker skimmed through the newspapers . More news of riots and uproars : this business of mobbing physicians , either because they had allegedly been practicing reanimation or because they had refused to reanimate someone , was becoming contagious . There were three instances of it in the late editions  --  from Idaho , Missouri , and Louisiana . The mobs acted with fine impartiality , rioting on both sides of the question . The editorial pages universally applauded the decision of the Senate to hold an immediate investigation . But the ideological division of the newspapers was more explicit than it had been on earlier days : Conservative papers now urged outright suppression of the reanimation process , and the Nat-Lib papers pleaded for sane consideration plus strong government controls . By now , everyone was getting into the act : philosophers , painters , athletes , pop stars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and con reanimation . The Russians at last were heard from : Georgi Aksakov , Presi-  | dent-General of the Federated Socialist States , sent a note of congratulations to President McComber on the American conquest of death , and extended the hope that America would follow the time-honored custom of sharing its scientific developments with the other nations of the world . By now , word had reached the settlements on the Moon and under the Mars Dome , too ; messages of warm enthusiasm had been radioed from the two international colonies in space . It was only to be expected , Harker thought , that the citizens of space would welcome the news gladly . Accidental death was a daily companion out there ; now it could be checked . And the waves of hysterical antiscientific reaction spreading across the United States were not likely to engulf the settlers on airless worlds , where technology was regarded as a friend rather than as a menace . It was fast becoming a contest between darkness and light , between education and ignorance , between reason and unreason  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rational , utterly sincere fanatics in the camp of the opposition . " We must have regard for the soul , " declared the spokesman for the Archbishop of Canterbury . " A limitation was placed on the term of man 's life when we went forth from Eden . We must proceed with the greatest care when we attempt to overthrow a limitation decreed by the Lord . " It was , Harker had to admit , a reasonable attitude ? granted a framework of beliefs that he and much of the rest of the world did not share . " The United States has always been the world pioneer , " declared Senator Marshall of Alabama , the elder statesman of the American-Conservatives . " We never show fear as we approach the boundary between the known and the unknown . But we must exert caution in this new step , and take care lest in moving recklessly forward we unleash forces which can destroy the bonds of society . " The medical societies had statements , too  --  sound ones . " The problem , " declared an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If the Beller process is valid , any physician will have the power to return life to the dead . Shall he make use of this power whenever he possibly can , taking it as his Hippocratic responsibility to heal and restore in every opportunity ? Or will there be the danger of giving life indiscriminately , perhaps to those who do not merit a reprieve , or to those who have been in some terrible way irreversibly transformed by the death experience ? What will happen if a dead man 's family refuses the right of reanimation ? Can the physician proceed against their will , for his patient 's sake ? And is he guilty of murder if he does not ? Who will make these decisions ? An entirely new code of medical ethics must come into being before any wide-scale practice of reanimation can be permitted . " These were sensible objections , and Harker had no real issue with them . But there were other , more hysterical voices clamoring in the newspapers , and carloads of vituperous letters had already reached the laboratory . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There were those who assumed that reanimation was likely to become the property of an elite that would perpetuate itself over and over , down through the centuries , while leaving the common people to die . There were those who dreaded the return to life of a loved one , who were unwilling to face again someone who had been " beyond " and returned . There were those who talked of the soul and its transformations , of the perils of defying fate , of the economic consequences of keeping people alive after their appointed time had come . Fear and ignorance , ignorance and fear . Harker was chilled by the letters he read in the newspapers . But the ones that came to the laboratory were even worse . . . . you are violating the commandment of God concerning man 's mortality brought upon us all by Adam 's fall . But you will rot in Hell for what you are trying to do . . . . ... you Harker and Raymond and all the rest of you  | should have been smothered in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is disgusting obscene and unChristian . You will fill the world with a loathsome tribe of undead zombies ... . ... I know what it is to have a loved one die , do you ? Yes , Harker thought . But I would not want to touch my lips to the lips of one who was dead and now walks again . .. . Harker paused a moment in thought as he read that last letter , wondering how he would have felt had Eva been brought back to him , alive , there on the beach . He had always thought that he would have rejoiced . But now he remembered how Lois had hesitated in responding to that possibility , and it seemed suddenly to him that he himself had some doubts . Would he really have wanted to embrace a daughter who had gone beyond the barrier of death and returned ? Would he not have felt some queasiness ? And if even he could ask himself such questions , how could he expect the people who Angrily he cut off the line of thought . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be contagious . Reading too many of these nutty letters  --  the sickness seeps out into me . The life process stops , it starts again  --  and is anything lost ? Does the soul go fluttering up to heaven when the brain shuts down ? Wake up , Harker . Of course you 'd have hugged Eva if she had been brought back to life . And given thanks . It had been a long day . He riffled through a few more letters , but the cumulative emotional impact was too great for him to bear after all the other conflicting events this day had brought . It was not easy to read letters from people who on Monday had been pleading for the reanimation of a loved one , and who now wrote bitterly to say that since the period of grace had passed , the reanimators had through their silence become murderers . ... my fiancee Joan who was seventeen and electrocuted in a kitchen accident Sunday night could have been  | saved if you were willing to do anything for her . But you did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone by and she is lost forever ... . Even more hellish than watching life ebb slowly from a dying person , Harker thought , must be the waiting while the hours pass after death , and the time for reanimation passes with them . New torments have been loosed upon the world , he saw . We 've made death conditional ; we 've multiplied the tortures of the survivors , who now can watch their loved ones die twice . He shivered . He felt like a man riding a tiger that grew bigger and toothier every day . He picked up another one : ... you may remember I mentioned my wife mother of our four children who was close to death from cancer . Well she died the night I wrote to you , and not having heard from you yet I suppose you can not help me in this matter . Her parents wanted to bury her the next day but I said wait , maybe we 'll hear . Even though I never had any real hope of that because who are we just nobodies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death , since she has now been gone two days I am arranging for her burial . Though I am disappointed and sad I do not hold bitterness in my heart against you , may God forgive you for having let Lucy die ... . Harker remembered that one : Mikkelsen , from Minnesota . The implied accusation of murder , cloaked as it was by the prayer for divine forgiveness , numbed him . He had had all he could take . He put the letters away , phoned across the lab to Raymond , and said he was calling it a day . The air was clean and warm as he stepped outside ; at five in the afternoon of an almost-summer day , the sun was still bright , the sky pale blue , curiously transparent . A sliver of moon was visible . Harker tried to blot out the network of human suffering whose vortex he had apparently become ; he drew in a deep breath , expanded his chest , swung his arms loosely at his sides . Home now . Try to relax . Home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A yellow dart crossed the sky and was gone ; after it came the abrupt blurp of sound . It was a southbound rocket to Florida . No doubt it would be landing in Miami before he had stepped through his front door . He remembered the legal fight when rocket service had been instituted on a commercial basis , almost thirty years back . A combination of special interests had tried to prevent that on environmental grounds , just as in an earlier generation the supersonic transport had been shot down as an ecological hazard before it got going . But whereas killing the SST had been desirable and necessary , the attempt to kill rocket transportation had been nothing much more than a power play on the part of those already entrenched in conventional transportation . Harker had looked up both contests in the previous few days . They were textbook cases in governmental response to technological advance . He remembered the Moon wrangle , too . He had cut his legal teeth on the suits and countersuits ; the case was standard law-school stuff . The Moon had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in 1969 , during a period of international conflict and danger ; the Russians had followed a few years later with their own manned expeditions , and by the 198os rival permanent bases were being established there . Another ten years went by , though , before the two superpowers were willing to take the logical step of agreeing to join forces in making lunar exploration and exploitation truly international in character . There , also , the forces of reaction had fought lunar co-operation on grounds that seemed to them just and necessary , trotting out antiCommunist slogans that had n't been heard since the unlamented 195os . Those forces had ultimately been defeated , amid predictions of imminent disaster  --  and now the Moon settlement and its newer companion on Mars were universally hailed as glittering examples of mankind 's ability to transcend national boundaries . Now reanimation . The old struggle was joined again . The instinctive terror of the unfamiliar was rising . Harker told  | himself that the force of history was on his side , that ultimate victory would be theirs . But what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what victims chosen , before that day ? He was home at a quarter past six . Lois had the video set on , and even as he stood in the doorway the words of a newscaster drifted toward him : Senator Thurman of New York and four colleagues today visited the Beller Laboratories and witnessed a successful human reanimation . Just before returning to Washington Senator Thurman commented , and I quote : There is no doubt that a restoration of life took place as we watched . What is in doubt is whether this power is one that mankind should permit itself to use . End quote . The committee that Senator Thurman heads will begin its hearings on the reanimation process Monday in Washington . .. . No committee of which Clyde Thurman was chairman was likely to turn in a report favoring a position with which Senator Thurman disagreed . And Harker already had some idea of Thurman 's views about the Beller process . The harbingers were grim . Harker kissed his wife wearily and said to Chris , " Get me something strong to drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The headline the next morning , black against the faint green of the paper , was : THURMAN ATTACKS LEGALIZED REANIMATION Harker read the story at breakfast . It told how the veteran Senator , having seen the Beller technique in action and having had an evening to meditate on it , had concluded that reanimation was evil and grotesque and should be suppressed . Harker was astounded . It was a staggering and wholly unexpected setback . Thurman had n't made any secret  | of his distaste for reanimation during his visit ; but for him to make that distaste public before the hearings had actually opened was incredible . What chance did they have now to sway the opinions of the other members of the committee , when the powerful Senator Thurman had gone to the extraordinary length of firing the first salvo ? He glanced quickly over the rest of the front page . No cheer to be found on it . Riot in Des Moines when doctor , pleading no knowledge of the reanimation process , fails to prevent death of high school football star . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performed reanimation touch off attack on doctor . The now-standard stories : damned if they do , damned if they do n't . The poor medics . And  --  Harker nearly choked over his coffee  --  what the devil was this ? RETURN TO LIFE A FAILURE ; PATIENT SUICIDES New York  --  Police are searching the Hudson River this morning for the body of 58-year-old Wayne Janson , who allegedly jumped to his death from the lower level of the George Washington Bridge late last night . A close friend of the dead man declared that Mr. Janson had been despondent since submitting to the Beller reanimation technique two months ago . The friend , Jonathan Bryant of 312 West 79th Street , said , " Wayne suffered a near-fatal stroke in February and placed himself in the hands of the Beller people as an experimental subject . I was notified early in March of his death following a second stroke , and of his subsequent successful reanimation . But when he returned from the hospital his entire personality seemed to have changed for the worse . " Mr. Bryant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went on to say . . . . " Excuse me , " Harker muttered to his wife . Clutching the paper , he ran to the phone and rapped out Mart Raymond 's number .  | " Mart ? Jim . Have you seen this Wayne Janson thing in the morning news ? " " What 's that ? " Harker rapidly read the article . After a moment of silence Raymond said , " Huh ? Who does he think he 's kidding ? " " What do you mean ? " " We 've never had a subject by that name . Bryant 's obviously fabricating something . " " I figured as much when I saw that he was connected with the story . But you better check the records closely . We 've got grounds for a splashy suit if Bryant 's lying , but if he is n't , we can get hurt very very badly . " " Jim , I tell you we 've never carried out any reanimations on anyone named Wayne Janson . And our indemnity procedures are such that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pseudonym . Bryant is obviously trying to smear us . " " To smear me , " Harker corrected . " But I guess ultimately it amounts to the same thing . " " What are you going to do ? " " Nothing yet , " Harker said . " I 'll wait until the police find the body and then demand proof from Bryant that his friend Janson ever underwent reanimation . " " But there is no body , Jim ! It 's just a hoax ! " Somberly Harker said , " It may be a hoax , but I 'm willing to bet there 's a body . Somebody fell off that bridge . Maybe even somebody whose name was Wayne Janson . Jonathan is n't that foolish . " The long-delayed Richard Bryant will hearing took place at last at half past ten that morning , in the gray-walled , peaceful chambers of District Judge T. H. Auerbach . The affair was almost a farce ; it was all over in less than twenty minutes . Jonathan Bryant failed to show up . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children , and she explained curtly that Jonathan was " overcome with  | grief at the death of a very dear friend last night " and would not attend . Six other Bryants were in court , all of them visibly hungry for the old man 's millions . They had retained a lawyer named Martinson , who briefly and concisely explained that the elder Bryant had not been in sound mind at the time of making his final will , and that it was therefore invalid . As evidence of the old man 's insanity , Martinson introduced a lengthy document purporting to describe some of his senile eccentricities . It was a flimsy position , and Harker said so . He spoke for no more than ten minutes , puncturing Martinson 's charges without bothering to go into much oral detail . Judge Auerbach smiled pleasantly , said he had studied the briefs from both sides with care , dismissed all accusations of Rick Bryant 's unsoundness of mind , and ruled that the will was valid . Just as simple as that . Helen Bryant tossed Harker a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her younger brothers and sisters . Auerbach leaned forward from his bench and said to Harker , " I 'm glad that 's over with . One more delaying injunction ? " " There would n't have been one , Tom . They were just playing a game with the court , stalling and waiting for their father to kick off . Jonathan simply did n't want to give him the satisfaction of winning while he was alive . " Auerbach shrugged . " They really did n't have a hope of upsetting that will . Martinson himself as much as admitted it in his brief . Were they just trying to make trouble ? " Harker nodded . " They were hitting their father in the only way they could . Trouble 's their specialty , Tom . " " Well , you 're through having trouble with the Bryants now , I guess . " " No , " Harker said , shaking his head slowly . " No , Tom . Not by a long shot . " He rode uptown from the courthouse and stopped off at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The girls in the  | outer office stared at him strangely , as though he had undergone some frightening apotheosis and now was something far more than merely the firm 's newest partner . He rapped on Bill Kelly 's door . The plump lawyer smiled at him as he entered , but not with much warmth . " Morning , Jim . Long time no see . " " I 've been busy . " " I know . I know all about it . " Harker ignored the uncharacteristic edge on Kelly 's tone and said , " I 've just come from the Bryant hearing . Thought I 'd let you know that it 's over . Poof : fifteen minutes ! " " The will was upheld ? " " What else ? We knew all along that it was just a case of the Bryant family trying to carry out some willful petty obstruction . They 're mean , twisted people , Bill . They 've lived all their lives in the shadow of one great man , and I guess they chose this way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Persons they really are . " He scowled . Kelly seemed to dismiss the Bryant affair with one toss of his head . Slowly he said , " Jim , this completes all the current work you 're doing here , is n't that right ? " Harker nodded . " I turned over the Fuller and Heidell cases to Portobello . We talked about that . It was to leave me clear for ? " " Yes . I know . " Kelly 's face reddened even more than normally , and he squirmed wretchedly in his pneumatic desk chair . " I 've been following the papers , Jim . I 've been following the whole thing . " " I warned you it was hot . " " I know . I did n't realize how hot it was , though . Jim , this hurts me , " Kelly said . " I 'm going to ask a favor of you . It 's a lousy thing to ask , because it shows I do n't have guts or the courage of your convictions or something along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll spare you the trouble of putting it into words . The answer is yes . If you think my presence in the firm will hurt the firm , Bill , I 'll resign . " A look of gratitude appeared on Kelly 's fleshy , sweat-  | shiny face . " Jim , I want you to understand  --  that is  --  well , look here , I asked you to come in with me when your party booted you out , and do n't think I did n't get my wrist slapped for it . But I did n't give a damn about the consequences , and there were some . I wanted you in this outfit , and to hell with threats . But this reanimation thing is too big . It 's got undertones and overtones that reach into every corner of society . I do n't want to get associated with it in any way . The risks scare me , Jim . I see a real danger that this firm could be wiped out if there 's trouble over your process , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lifetime building . I do n't need to tell you that a partnership like ours is vulnerable in a way that a corporation is n't . A couple of hefty suits  --  a few expensive contingencies  --  they 've got us right down to our personal possessions , Jim , there 's no escaping it . And so  --  well , it seemed to Portobello and Klein and me ? " " Sure , Bill . " Harker had a sudden dizzying vision of himself standing at the rim of a bottomless abyss , getting ready to jump , but he heard his voice , calm , rock-steady , saying , " I 'll draft a note informing you that I 'm severing my connection with the firm because of the pressure of outside activities . " Hoarsely Kelly said , " Thanks , Jim . And if this thing blows over  --  if it all works out the right way  --  we 'll have a spot for you here . Do n't forget that . " " I wo n't . " Not that Kelly meant it . Harker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was just a formal ritualistic statement , part of the proper procedure for letting a partner go , this implication that he could always come back in some quieter future time . He was through there . Probably he was through with private law practice forever . Kelly was a brave and intelligent man , but even Kelly had been afraid to keep the hot potato that was James Harker on his letterhead any longer . No one else was likely to welcome him . Beller Labs was the only straw to which he could cling now . He stood up .  | " Okay , Bill . I 'm glad we got everything taken care of so smoothly . I 'll clear out my office next week ; will that be okay ? " " No hurry about it . Whenever it 's convenient for you . Oh ? nearly forgot . " Kelly consulted a memo slip . " Leo Winstead 's office phoned here for you earlier today . The Governor wants you to call him back between half past one and three this afternoon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Thanks , Bill . And so long . " He bought a noontime edition of the Star-Post and ate a gloomy little meal by himself in a nineteenth-floor automated restaurant overlooking the East River . He pushed the meal-selector buttons almost at random , and out of the slots came a chaotic assortment of cheap synthetics , but he hardly cared . He ate mechanically , paying no attention to the food as he shoveled it in . What held his attention was the increasingly more dismaying news the paper offered . There was a new statement from Senator Thurman , more vehemently anti-reanimation than the last . Evidently Thurman did n't mind some injudicious prehearing publicity ; he seemed to be bubbling over with loathing for the Beller process . Now he said , " Reanimation is of dubious value in mitigating human sorrow  --  a crude and unsatisfactory business that robs life of dignity and plunders the tomb of its repose . " That was in response to the story about the Janson suicide . And speaking of that Yes . The body had been found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Page One . Wayne Janson , 58 . Unmarried . Occupation given as " investor . " Death listed as suicide ; body identified by Jonathan Bryant . Investigation now proceeding as a result of Bryant 's statement that Janson had recently been depressed in the aftermath of a Beller reanimation . David Klaus was back in the news , too , with a manifesto clearly concocted by Mitchison : " The Janson case proves  | conclusively that the Beller reanimation technique can be a dangerous and destructive instrument in the wrong hands . We can only hope that it will be placed under proper control before further such tragedies can occur . " At half past one Harker made his way to a public phone booth , sealed himself in , snapped on the privacy shield , and rang for the operator . When the robot voice asked what he wanted , Harker gave his credit-card number and put through his call to Albany . A relay of secretaries at the Governor 's mansion passed him along in tortuous fashion until at last he reached Leo Winstead . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definition was poor . Even so , Harker could see the fatigue on Winstead 's face . New York 's Governor looked bleary-eyed and tense . Harker said , " I got your message , Leo . What goes ? " " Have you seen the latest statement from Thurman about reanimation ? " " Of dubious value in mitigating human sorrow ' ? Yes , I saw it . Jesus , Leo , I never thought the old man would carry on like this . The hearing has n't even started and he 's practically destroyed us already . " " He 's made a surprising lot of noise , yes , " Winstead said . The Governor looked like a man about to explode from centrifugal tensions . In a tight-strung voice he said , " Jim , we held a caucus on the Thurman situation last night . Supposedly it was the state committee meeting , but we had a lot of national-headquarters people on the line too . " " And ? " " First let me tell you that the state committee is going to issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and asking for careful consideration of reanimation , with the hope that it 'll be given Congressional blessing and placed under regulated auspices as quickly as feasible . " Harker smiled . " It 's about time someone said he was on our side . " " Do n't congratulate yourselves too lustily , " Winstead  | warned . " It took all night before we could agree on giving you any support at all . I do n't think you 'd be getting beans from the Nat-Libs if the Amer-Cons had n't forced our hand . A lot of us are n't in favor of reanimation at all , regardless of the national committee 's stand . " " And a lot of you are n't in favor of anything I might be in favor of , " Harker said crisply . " But I do n't give a damn about the behind-the-scenes stuff . If the National-Liberal Party is going to come out on my side , that 's all I 'm interested in . But what 's this about Thurman now ? " " He 's killing us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the patriarch of our party is issuing wild statements condemning it ? He 's getting all the headlines . He 's cutting us off at the ankles . " Harker shrugged . " I 'll admit you have a problem . Your Thurman problem is n't as big as mine , but it 's a problem . " " Jim , would you do us a favor ? " The idea of doing favors to the party leaders who had summarily expelled him less than a year ago seemed absurd to him . But he said in a cautious voice , " Maybe . What do you want ? " " We have n't approached Thurman directly yet . We 'd like you to do it . " " Me ? " Winstead nodded . " Go down to Washington and appeal to the old gorilla 's sense of party unity . Plead with him to come back into the fold . Show him how he 's playing into the hands of the opposition . Thurman was once very high on you , Jim . Maybe he still is . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lab and he was n't exactly running over with sentiment . I do n't think he gives much of a damn about party unity in this case . Reanimation gets to him on some very deep level : it 's a philosophical question to him , not a political one . He came , he saw , and he condemned . What more can I say to him ? " Winstead 's face grew agitated . Harker wondered what pressures had been exerted on this amiable politician to  | make so disagreeable a phone call . " Jim , this is for your sake as well as ours . If you can win Thurman over , Congressional approval of reanimation is in the bag ! You 're just slitting your own throat by refusing to go down . " " I 'm aware that Thurman 's support is vital . I 'm also aware that nothing I could say or do would get that support now . And you know that I 'm not especially anxious to do favors for ? " ' We understand that ! But you could try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . We do n't want to be made to look foolish by having party policy junked by one of our own revered statesmen , but you 've got more to gain than just saving face , right ? So go , Jim . Talk to him . We 'll try to make things easier for you within the state if you can bring Thurman around . " Harker grinned pleasantly . It was fun to see Winstead squirm . " Okay , " he said finally . " I 'm not optimistic . But I 'll do it for your sake . I 'll go down to see Thurman first thing tomorrow morning . " FOURTEEN Friday morning . Ten-fifteen A.M. , May 24 , 2033 . James Harker stared out the round , clear window at the fleecy whiteness of the cloud cover over Washington . The jet was in its descent pattern , plunging toward the distant runway . Harker felt the faint drag of gravity , heard the thank of the landing gear going into place , and started to put away the papers he 'd been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His appointment with Thurman was set for half past eleven , at the Capitol . He rolled the pat phrases around in his mind yet once more : " Mr. Thurman , you stuck by me long ago ? " " I feel you owe this to your party , sir , the party you helped to found and nurture ? "  | " Is there no way I can persuade you that this process represents a forward step toward the bright utopia of tomorrow , Senator ? " None of the arguments he had so carefully rehearsed sounded even remotely convincing . Thurman was a stubborn old man with some kind of fixation about reanimation ; no amount of cajoling was going to get him to alter his stand . Still , Harker thought , he owed it to himself to try . Could n't Thurman be made to see that he himself , at the edge of his nineties , might soon be a candidate for the Beller process ? But that approach was too obvious . The expectation of imminent death must be something that Thurman lived with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maybe he could n't wait to shuffle off this mortal coil . Maybe he felt threatened by the whole concept . A crude and unsatisfactory business , Thurman had said . Robs life of dignity and plunders the tomb of its repose . Its repose . In that case , what hope was there to change his mind ? And therefore The yellow light flashed and a soft voice emanating from a speaker next to Harker 's ear murmured , " Please fasten your safety belts . We 'll be landing in Washington in a few minutes . " Harker guided the magnetic snaps together until he heard the proper click . The plane broke through the thick layer of clouds that blanketed the sky at twenty thousand feet and began to drop toward the white , neat , oddly sterile-looking city of Washington . He found himself wondering if there would be any further difficulty over the Wayne Janson case while he was gone . Police investigators had arrived at the labs in midafternoon the day before , wanting to know if a reanimation had been carried out on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . The police had wanted to see the laboratory records , but at Harker 's advice Raymond refused to turn anything over to them without a subpoena . Any really comprehensive investigation , Harker felt sure ,  | was bound eventually to discover that the whole affair had been staged by Bryant , who had taken advantage of his friend 's suicide to smear the reanimators . But the suicide was in the newspapers , and no expose ever really cancels out bad publicity . The public would now  --  with more justice than anyone yet suspected  --  link reanimation with mental disturbances afterward . Harker longed to have Jonathan Bryant 's neck in his grasp , just for a minute . He leaned back and waited for the landing . It was nearly eleven when he reached Capitol Hill and made his way to Senator Thurman 's suite of offices . The old lawmaker 's headquarters sprawled over half a floor , an imposing lair , as befitted a Senator who not only represented the Union 's second-most-populous state but who was now serving his seventh term in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years out of law school greeted Harker as he entered the oak-paneled antechamber . " Sir ? " " I 'm James Harker . I have an appointment with the Senator for half past eleven . " " Yes , certainly . Would you wait here , please ? " Harker took a seat . And waited . And waited some more . Several times a door opened at the far end of the room ; he expected to be summoned in , but no , he was merely being stared at . Young aides curious about the fallen Governor , no doubt . Now it was half past eleven . And then quarter to twelve . The next time the door opened , Harker asked what was going on . There was a whispered conference in the next room . Then the young secretary returned , looking troubled . " It 's getting late , " Harker said . " I know , sir . I 'm sorry , sir . " " Senator Thurman 's normally a very punctual man , as I remember him . " Was this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Thurman was usually more subtle . " I 'd like to know how much longer I 'll be kept out here . "  | " I do n't know , sir . " " You do n't know ? " " I 'm very sorry , sir . But the fact is that the Senator has n't arrived yet this morning . " " Has he forgotten our appointment ? " The aide looked more and more uneasy . " I ca n't tell you that , Mr. Harker . We have n't heard from him at all . Possibly he 's ill , sir . " " Ill ? " " It 's most unusual for him to be late . He 's always in his office promptly at nine , and it 's practically noon now , and so we think he must not be feeling well . " So far as Harker knew , Clyde Thurman had not known a day 's illness yet in the twenty-first century . Strange that he should fall ill on this day of all days , when he had an appointment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thurman to dodge trouble that way . Harker said , " Have you checked with his home ? " " No , sir . " The aide appeared to resent Harker 's question . " We do n't probe the Senator 's personal life . " " But something might be wrong ! For all you know , the Senator is seriously ill . Or dead . " A shrug . " We have n't received any word , sir . " The aide went out . Harker paced the antechamber for fifteen minutes more , sitting intermittently , fidgeting , glancing up nervously every time the big outer door opened to admit someone . He thought back thirty-odd years , to the time when eight-year-old Jimmy Harker had been reported to his school principal for some no doubt trifling infraction of the rules . He had fidgeted in just this fashion in the anteroom of the principal 's office , waiting for the principal to come back from lunch and administer the punishment ? his head popping around every time some clerk opened the door , his stomach roiling with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming . Eventually , he remembered , the principal had come  --  and had neither expelled him nor phoned for his father , merely  | reprimanded him and sent him back to his classroom . Maybe the same thing will happen today , he thought , maybe old Thurman will have a miraculous change of heart But there were no miracles . And there was no sign of Thurman . The members of the Senator 's staff went serenely about their routine duties , ignoring the tense , perspiring man in the outer office . At a quarter past twelve Harker rose and confronted the secretary again . " Any word from him yet ? " " Not yet , sir , " was the bland reply . " Why wo n't you check with the Senator 's residence ? " " We never disturb the Senator at home , sir . " Exasperated , Harker said , " And of course you wo n't give me his home number , will you ? " " Afraid that 's impossible , sir . " " Is there anything you will do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd like to call Senator Fletcher . " Fletcher was the Senate Majority Leader , another veteran Nat-Lib who was likely to know where to reach Thurman if anyone did . A little to Harker 's surprise , the secretary said , " You can use the phone back here . Just pick up and tell the switchboard who you 're calling . " The phone was audio only . A metallic voice asked him for the number he wanted , and Harker , resisting the temptation to try to get Thurman 's home number  --  it was probably unlisted  --  said , " Would you connect me with the office of Senator Fletcher ? " Four secretaries later , Harker heard the deep , confident voice of Fletcher of Pennsylvania saying , " Heard you were in town , Harker . What can I do for you ? " " I 'm here to see Senator Thurman . Do you know where ? " " Thurman ? Where are you now , Harker ? " " At his office . He is n't here , and I thought you might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew where Thurman was right now I 'd be talking to him and not to you . I 'm looking for him myself . " Harker 's hopes faded . " Have you phoned his home ? "  | " Yes . Nobody 's seen him there since early last evening . " " Last evening ? He 's been missing all night and ? " " If you get any word , Harker , call me back , will you ? " The line went dead . Slowly Harker put down the receiver . He walked over to the smug secretary and said casually , " Friend , you 'd better start looking for a new job . Senator Fletcher 's been in touch with Senator Thurman 's residence . Thurman has n't been seen since sometime last night . " " What ? But ? " " I think you better start checking around , " Harker said . " I 'll be back later if the Senator turns up . " Harker had lunch and paid courtesy calls on a couple of his friends in the New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the news about Senator Thurman was all over Washington . Harker picked up an early-afternoon newspaper when he saw the huge scare-head : WHERE IS SENATOR THURMAN ? There was nothing new in the article . It was just a late , boxed flash saying that the 88-year-old Nat-Lib Senator had last been seen at his huge bachelor home in Alexandria shortly after dark the night before , and had n't been heard from subsequently . Secret Service men were combing Washington and the outlying districts . The three-thirty headlines screamed , THURMAN STILL MISSING ! No word has yet been received of the whereabouts of Senator Clyde Thurman ( N-L , N.Y. ) , who vanished from his Alexandria residence early last evening . The veteran lawmaker is slated to preside over the controversial reanimation hearings beginning Monday if . . . . By four o'clock there was still no news of the missing Senator . Harker went out to the airport and boarded a four-thirty flight to New York . At five , he was at Kennedy ; he phoned Lois from there , told her what had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to New Jersey to confer with the Beller people . The New York evening papers that he saw at JFK were full of the Thurman disappearance . No news , no news , no news . A Senator vanishes . The crazy speculations were beginning : foreign agents had done it , or perhaps the Senator 's political opponents had removed him , or was he suffering from amnesia and wandering around Washington 's Skid Row ? Harker got to the laboratory shortly after six . There were no reporters around , for a change . Nevertheless , three guards , fully armed , stood by the roadblock . They told him that Mart Raymond was in the main operating lab . Harker hurried across the clearing toward the big building . A latespring breeze whistled down through the spruces , chilling him ; the sun was a dying , swollen , reddish ball hovering close to the horizon . Harker felt a strange sense of imminent catastrophe . Three white-garbed medics guarded the entrance to the lab . As Harker started to go past them , one of them said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Harker . Be sure to keep quiet on your way in . " Harker tiptoed past . Inside he saw a tense group clustered around the operating table : Raymond , Vogel , Lurie , Barchet , and a surgeon whose name Harker did not know . A figure was lying on the table . Harker could not see the face . Raymond detached himself from the group and came toward him . The lab director 's face was pale , almost clammy ; his lips were clamped tensely , and his eyes bulged . He looked frightened half into a state of shock . " What 's going on ? " Harker whispered . " Experiment , " Raymond said , shivering . " God , I wish we had n't started this . " He seemed close to collapse . Puzzled , Harker edged closer to the table , shunting little Barchet aside to get a better view . Five guilt-shadowed faces turned uneasily to stare at him .  | For a long moment Harker studied the exposed features of the cadaver on the table . Billowing waves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He could n't accept the truth of what he saw . The enormity of it left him almost incapable of speech for a few seconds . Finally he looked at Raymond and said , " What in God 's name have you idiots done ? " " We  --  we thought  --  that is ? " Barchet cut in . " We all agreed on it after you left yesterday . We would bring him here and try to convince him that we were right . Because without him we were finished . But in the middle of everything he  --  had a heart attack and  --  died . So In the yellow light of the unshielded incandescents the lie stood out in bold relief on Barchet 's face . " A heart attack , " Harker said tonelessly . " You were sitting here talking to him in a polite way and he suddenly had a heart attack and keeled over . Yes ? " Barchet looked at the floor . " Tell me what happened here ! " Harker said . They were all silent . Five schoolboys , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He stared at them grimly . And at the body of Senator Clyde Thurman on the operating table . It was Lurie who said finally , " We might as well tell the truth . We brought Thurman here and we hit him with an anesthetic spray at overdose level . Then we put him in for reanimation . We 're going to revive him and explain that he died of natural causes , but that he 's been reanimated . We figure that that 's the most dramatic possible demonstration of the value of our ? " " No , " Harker muttered . " You did n't . You are n't . You wo n't . " Wobbly-legged , he groped for a lab stool and sat down heavily , cradling his suddenly pounding head in his hands . The insanity of what these men had done behind his back stunned and dazed him . To dare to kidnap Thurman , to  | kill him , to hope that by reviving him they would convert him to their cause  --  oh , no , no , no . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You realize you 've condemned us all to death , " he said . " Jim , " Raymond began , " do you really think ? " " Kidnaping , first-degree murder , illegal scientific experimentation  --  oh , Christ , I could strangle the lot of you ! " He felt more like bursting into tears . " Do n't you see that when you revive him he 's bound to hit you with everything he can throw ? Was he aware of what you were doing to him when you gave him that anesthetic spray ? " " He could n't have been . We came up from behind  --  a quick squirt , a thousandth of a second and he was out , " Raymond said . " And then into the car and up here . " " Incredible , " Harker said hoarsely . " Crazy . Crazy . I turn my back on you for just one day and you start slinking around kidnaping and killing and  --  oh , God ! " " We planned it a long time ago , " Barchet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We did n't think you 'd come back so fast , and we figured we 'd have everything wrapped up before you found out . " Vogel said , " Perhaps if we do n't carry out the resuscitation , and merely dispose of the body ? " " No ! " Harker bellowed . " We 'll reanimate him . If he guesses that he was put to death solely for the purpose of being reanimated , that 'll be the end of this grand crusade . Finish . If you can persuade him that he died naturally and was brought here as an act of mercy , you may be able to luck your way through . But you wo n't . You are n't smart enough to lie to Clyde Thurman and get away with it . Either way , I want out . I do n't want to be mixed up with a pack of baboons like you . " He turned away , looking down at Thurman 's massive head , imposing even in death . Harshly he said , " Go on ! Get started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vogel and the assisting surgeon prepared the complex reanimating instru-  | ment . Harker 's heart pounded steadily , booming in a wild crescendo as if struggling to burst through his rib cage . He felt very tired . But now , thanks to this one monumental blunder , all the striving was at an end and he was released from toil . Thurman , awakened , would understand what had been done to him , and would denounce them . After that , they would cease to be the leaders of a grand scientific adventure , and would take on the status of mere criminals . Harker listened to the murmured instructions being passed back and forth across the table , watched the needles entering the flesh , the electrodes being clamped in place . Minutes passed . Vogel 's thin hand grasped the controlling rheostat . Power surged into the dead man 's body . After a while Harker rose and joined the group around the table . Needles wavered and leaped high , indicating that life had returned , that the vital signs were sustaining themselves . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The jagged graph held little meaning for Harker . But he did not need to study its peaks and valleys to understand what had happened . The eyes of the man on the operating table had fluttered open , and were staring toward the ceiling . They were not the beady , alert , eager eyes of Senator Thurman . They were the dull , glazed , slack-muscled eyes of an idiot . For a moment , no one spoke . Harker stood some five feet from the operating table , looking away from the creature under the machine . These people are like small boys with a shiny new toy , he thought . I should never have left them alone long enough to pull something like this . I should never have become involved with them in the first place . " What do we do now ? " Lurie demanded . The gangling biologist seemed close to hysteria . Droplets of sweat beaded  | his forehead ; his lips trembled ; his shoulders were hunched close together , as though he felt a chill . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Permanently ? " Harker asked . " There 's no way of restoring it ? " Raymond shook his head . " None . The EEG indicates permanent damage to the brain . " " " What about this DNA business of yours ? You said you could regenerate brain tissue , did n't you ? Why not regenerate his ? " " It 's not that simple , " said Vogel . " We 're capable of only a very limited degree of regeneration , which is usually sufficient to reverse the very limited degree of decay that 's taken place . But this is n't a matter of that kind of postmortem decay . It 's a defect in the reanimation process that causes this . We 've introduced decay of our own into his brain . And we do n't know how to undo that yet . " Harker took a deep breath . " If that 's so , there 's nothing for us to do but kill him again and dispose of the body . " The suggestion seemed to shock them . Barchet reacted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Exactly . And what did you think you were committing the first time you killed him ? " " It was different then , " Raymond said morosely . " It was like putting him under deep anesthesia that happened to terminate the life processes for a short while . But now  --  to terminate him again , without the intent of reanimating him ? " " According to the present law of the land , " Harker said , " you were all guilty of first-degree murder the moment you put Thurman to sleep , no matter what you planned to do with him afterward . The law needs fixing now , but that 's irrelevant . Incidentally , even if you had n't killed him , you made yourselves subject to federal kidnaping law the moment you took him across state lines . There 's a death penalty for that , too , though God knows when it was last imposed . " " How about you ? " Barchet snapped . " You keep talking  | about what we 're guilty of . Why are you counting yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the little man who had caused so much trouble . " I 'm not guilty of anything , and you damned well know it . The kidnaping and murder both were carried out without my knowledge or consent . By the time I found out what you were up to , Thurman was already dead , and the bungled reanimation attempt that followed is outside our present legal structure . But there probably is n't a court in the world that would believe I was n't part of the conspiracy , so I guess I 'm in this boat with you . At the moment we all stand guilty of kidnaping and first-degree murder . I 'm simply suggesting we get rid of the evidence and proceed as if nothing had happened . Either that or call the police right now and prepare to go out of the reanimating business . " Harker closed his eyes a moment . I 'm dreaming this , he thought . I 'm standing here telling my accomplices we 've got to get rid of the corpse . No . No . No . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The lab director 's face was ashen with dismay and fear ; like the rest of them , he was awakening slowly to the magnitude of the catastrophe . " We did this thing because we thought it would serve our ultimate goal . We were monumentally wrong . But the only way we can continue to serve our goal is to commit another crime . We 'll have to dispose of the body . " " That wo n't be too hard , " Vogel said . " We dispose of bodies pretty frequently around here . I 'll do a routine dissection and then we 'll just make sure the parts get pretty widely scattered through the usual channels . " Raymond nodded . He seemed to be growing calmer now . " You 'd better begin at once . Give him the anesthetic again and do the job in Autopsy Lab C. Make it the most comprehensive damn autopsy you ever carried out . " Silently Vogel and the other surgeon wheeled the body from the room , with Lurie following . In the empty operating room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he felt no fear , no apprehension , not even a sense of impending calamity  --  only a kind of dull , hopeless pain , as though sentence had already been pronounced and he had come to terms with doom . " Well done , " he said finally . " I wish I could tell you exactly how I feel now . " Pursing his lips nervously , Raymond said , " That is n't hard . You 'd like to strangle us . " " Something like that . Only strangling seems too generous . Why did you have to do it ? Why ? " " We thought it would help us , " said Barchet . " Help ? To kidnap and kill a United States Senator ? But ? oh , what 's the use ? Just remember now that there are six of us who know about this . The first one who cracks and talks not only sends all six of us to the gas chamber but finishes reanimation permanently . " " Do you seriously believe the death penalty would be invoked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know . Assassination of a high public official  --  the laws are on the books . With enough public indignation stirred up over the crime , I think they 'd execute us . We 'd be lucky not to be drawn and quartered . " Suddenly Harker did not want to be in this place or near these men . He said , " I 'm going to my office to get some papers , and then I 'm going home to rest . Can I leave you irresponsible lunatics alone for an entire weekend without worrying about what you 'll commit next ? " Raymond looked boyishly at his shoes ; Barchet tried to glare defiantly at Harker , but there was something sickly and unconvincing about the expression . Harker went out . He made the long journey from the lab to his home by taxi , an extravagance that he did not often permit himself . Tonight it seemed necessary . He had no heart for facing other people in a public conveyance , for buying tickets at a terminal , for standing in lines , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cab , with the driver sealed off by his  | compartment wall . He sat alone , staring out at the bright lights of the nighttime city as he rode northward . Friday . Black Friday . May 24 , 2033 . Harker thought back to that long-ago morning when Lurie had first approached him to join this project . That had been a Wednesday ; May 8 , it had been . Two weeks and two days ago , and in that time so much had happened to him , so many unexpected things . He had re-entered public life , this time as publicity agent , legal adviser , and general champion of a weird and controversial cause . He had been eased out of his affiliation with the law firm , an affiliation that he had expected to retain for the rest of his life . He had become a stranger to his family . He was now a man bound up entirely in the manyleveled conflicts arising out of the simple announcement that a successful technique for reanimation of the dead had been developed . Developed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human beings , both of them dead , return to the ranks of the living . He had watched a third man , a great man , once one of his idols , suffer death needlessly and stupidly in the name of this strange cause . He had become a kidnaper and murderer . Unintentionally , true , and his crimes had been crimes after the fact ; but his guilt was as sure as that of the man who had given Clyde Thurman the anesthetic . He had acquired new enemies . Mitchison , Klaus , Jonathan Bryant  --  petty little men , those three , but they could cause trouble . Barchet , who was theoretically on his side but still managed to hurt him with everything he did . The Church ; the American-Conservative Party ; the ignorant , fearful people of the world , dreading all change and swayed by whatever paranoia happened to be endemic at the moment . Had it been worth it ? He thought back , trying to put himself in the mind of that James Harker of 8 May 2033 who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bait had been the image of  | Eva , drowned , beyond his grasp . Eva might have lived , if there had been a Beller process years before . Yes , he thought . It was worth it . Abruptly the gloom began to lift from him . He realized that none of the dark things that had happened to him lately really mattered  --  not his dismissal by Kelly , nor the crimes for which he had assumed the burden , nor the inner turmoil that was depleting his energies . In the long run those were trifles . In the long run everything was . The one important fact was reanimation . The invasion of death 's dominion . The defeat of death . That was his goal , and it was a good goal no matter what others said , and he would work toward attaining it  --  and if he destroyed himself and those about him in the course of that struggle , well , there had been martyrs in man 's history before , and for worse causes . That the Evas of tomorrow might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will go ahead . " Larchmont , mister , " the driver called out . " Which way is it ? " Harker gave him the directions . He was home a few minutes later . As the cab pulled away , Harker stood outside the house for a moment . The sitting-room lights were on , and one of the upstairs bedroom lights . It was shortly before ten o'clock , and , since it was the weekend , Chris would still be up , though young Paul would have been long since tucked away . And Lois probably sat before the television set , a placid , patient Penelope , waiting for her wandering husband to come home . Harker smiled gently , put his thumb to the identity plate of the front door , and watched it slide open . Lois came downstairs to greet him . She looked pale and tired ; when she kissed him , it was more a ritual than a show of affection . " How did everything go ? " she asked . He shrugged . " I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on inside . Tell me about your day . " She led him to the sitting room . The autoknit stood to one side , still set up with yarn . She had been making socks  | today , it seemed . The quiet , domestic life . The screen of the video showed jagged , clashing patterns of color , and a harsh voice blared out of it : Come on and skeet with me , baby , Come on and heat with me , baby , Just you and me Yo vodio dee Harker pointed toward the set . " When did you get interested in that kind of junk ? " Lois smiled faintly . " It 's a good tranquilizer . I just let the sound bellow out and blanket my mind . " He thumbed the nearest oFF switch ; the singing died away , the image shrank to a spot of brilliantly colored light and then to nothing at all . His hand sought hers . He found himself wishing she would let it all boil over , for once  --  her resentments , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this cozy suburban nest . But she was so wonderfully patient ! She had only one failing , and that was her capacity for resigned acceptance . She had said nothing , or not very much , when he had stubbornly defied the warnings of the state committee and gone ahead with the reform program that was bound to end his political career . She had barely objected when he told her of his new affiliation with the Beller people , and she had not complained at all in these past ten days , when the rising tensions of the reanimation debate had kept him bottled up within himself , unloving , distant . He tried to say something affectionate . Go on , Harker : drop her a crumb of warmth , repay her for all her suffering , her lonely evenings , the grim breakfasts . But he could n't will himself into an emotion he could n't feel , and just now he was beyond all emotion , drained , empty . She said , as he stood there groping for words , " They still have n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as of the nine-thirty newscast . Is n't it terrible , an old man like that disappearing ? "  | He was unable to look at her . " Still have n't found him ? " he murmured . " Strange . But the old buzzard 's indestructible . He 'll turn up . " " If he does n't , what effect will this have on the hearing ? Will they delay it ? " He wet his dry lips . You know damn well where Thurman is , and you 're afraid to tell her , he thought . Why do n't you speak up ? Are n't you going to let her know ? Your own wife ? He said , " I suppose they 'll choose a new chairman and start after a couple of days ' postponement , if something 's really happened to Thurman . But ? " " Jim , are you all right ? You look terrible . You sound so disconnected ! " " Lois , I  --  want to tell you something . Today ? " He stopped , wondering how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , curious but not overly curious , waiting unhurriedly to hear whatever he had to say . Reprieve . The phone rang . Grateful for the interruption , Harker sprang from the couch and darted around back to take the call on the picturephone . Mart Raymond 's face appeared on the screen . " Well ? " Harker said immediately . " Is everything taken care of ? The autopsy over ? " " Yes , " said Raymond . " But that 's not what I called about . Barchet 's dead ! " " What ? How ? " " It happened about five minutes ago . He was getting ready to leave , and we were discussing  --  you know , what happened tonight . Then Barchet folded up and dropped . A coronary . A massive attack . The excitement , I suppose . His heart was weak  --  he said it was , anyway . " Harker could not repress the tide of relief that rose in him . Barchet had been a troublemaker . Still , a man was dead , and it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's too bad . Did he have a family ? " " His wife died years ago . He was alone . "  | " All right . I ca n't say I 'm broken up about it much . Who 's going to handle the funeral arrangements ? " " Jim , what kind of question is that ? " Raymond asked . ' What do you mean ? " " Barchet 's in the operating room now . Vogel 's getting ready to try a reanimation on him . " " No ! " Harker cried . " No ? No ? Jim , what are you saying ? How can we allow him to die , and not even ? " " Barchet was an enemy , Mart . An obstacle . A weak link in the organization . Now we 're rid of him ; let him stay dead . It 'll simplify things not to have him around raising objections to everything we want to do . And with him gone there 's one less witness to the thing that happened today . " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean what you 're saying , Jim . " " I mean exactly what you 're hearing . Barchet was unstable , Mart . He pressured you into doing all sorts of cockeyed things for his own bizarre reasons . If he lived , he 'd end up somehow using the Thurman business as a weapon against us . Let him stay dead . That 's an order . " Raymond seemed to shrink back from the screen . " It 's almost like committing murder , Jim ! The man can still be saved , I 'm certain . And you 're telling me ? " " To let him go out , " Harker said with a firmness he did not feel . " I mean it . There 'll be trouble if you cross me on this , Mart . Good night . " He broke the contact with a shaky hand . Lois gasped when he returned to the sitting room . " How pale you are ! Was it bad news ? " He sat down heavily . " One of the Beller executives just dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a runty little fellow who enjoyed sticking lead pipes between the spokes of smoothly running machines . I just ordered Mart Raymond not to attempt reanimation on him . " His hands were quivering . Lois took them between hers . Harker went on , " It 's like a sort of murder , is n't it ? To refuse to re-  | animate a man , when it 's possible to bring him back . But it 's better for everyone if Barchet stays dead . Nobody 's going to miss him . God , I feel awful . " " Remember the McDermott case , Jim ? " " Of course . " McDermott had been a factory hand , an overgrown moron of twenty-two who had beaten his seventyyear-old father to death one night shortly before Harker had become Governor of New York , then had killed a policeman who came to investigate the old man 's screams . The murder of a peace officer was one of the few capital crimes still on the books . The verdict was speedy , the sentence was death . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office . With the boy in the death house and the night of the execution at hand , his aged mother  --  vindictive throughout the trial  --  had relented and pleaded with the Governor to commute the sentence . The boy had had a long criminal record . The court had found him guilty . He had murdered his father with some degree of premeditation and had killed a policeman . Harker had no love for the death penalty , that barbaric revival of a darker age , but he was already in deep political trouble and was being accused , among other things , of being soft on crime . He refused to commute the sentence . But then he had spent the rest of the evening staring at his watch , and at the stroke of midnight had begun to shiver . Now he nodded solemnly . " I refused to commute Barchefs sentence . That 's all there is to it . " The newspapers Saturday morning gave full play to the disappearance of Clyde Thurman . Several of them ran lengthy biographies of the missing Senator , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the NationalLiberal Party to his present anti-reanimation stand , and there was speculation galore on what might have happened to him .  | But no one appeared to be on the right trail . The statements from the FBI and the District of Columbia police were simply mechanical handouts , repeats of the previous night 's bland assurances that no stone would be left unturned in the search for Thurman . There were no clues . There were no suspects . There did not even seem to be any great suspicion of foul play ; Harker got the impression that the law believed Thurman had collapsed and died unseen in some quiet corner of his estate , and would turn up in due time . A little to Harker 's horror , he discovered that he had somehow come to terms with the crime . He had slept well and much of his tension was gone from him . He realized that he had succeeded in persuading himself that the violent thing Raymond and Barchet had done was merely the sort of response one could expect to the violent way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and why not accept it ? So he accepted . He had begun the process of putting the ghastly business out of his mind . He would not even withdraw , as he had threatened to do , from his relationship with the laboratory . He would hope for the best and continue along the path already entered upon . The obituary pages offered one item that held his atten-tion : SIMEON BARCHET Simeon Barchet of 201 Princeton Road , Rockville Center , L.L , treasurer a f the Beller Research Laboratories , died of a heart attack at the Beller offices in Litchfield , N.J. yesterday . His age was 61 . Mr. Barchet joined the staff of the late industrialist D. F. Beller in 2014 , after serving as a vice-president of the Chase Manhattan Bank . Upon Mr. Beller 's death ten years later , he became a trustee of the Beller Fund and participated actively in the organization and operation of the laboratory in Litchfield where the Beller reanimation process was developed . His wife , the former Elsie Tyler , died several years ago . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see that Raymond had not dared to defy him ; the reanimation of Barchet had been halted as he ordered . No doubt a good many sharp-eyed readers would notice the Barchet obit and wonder why an official of the Beller Laboratories had been allowed to die on the premises and stay dead , when all the reanimation equipment was right there . No doubt the question would be put to him before the day was out , too . He was not mistaken . At noon Mart Raymond called . The media , he said , were picking up on the Barchet story and asking how come no reanimation . The best that Raymond had been able to do was to promise a statement later in the day . " What am I supposed to tell them ? " he asked . " The truth ? " " Do n't be funny . I 've worked out an alibi already , " Harker said . " Call a press conference and announce that Barchet was despondent over personal affairs and left a memo imploring us in the strongest terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literally worried himself to death  --  that it was the next thing to actual suicide . And naturally we abided by his last request , even though it pained us to let such a valued colleague go to the grave needlessly . Got it ? " " Got it . You know , it sounds halfway plausible . " The newspapers moved fast . By nightfall the story was on the front pages , generally headed with something like BELLER EXEC CHOOSES DEATH . The editorial pages of the Star-Post 's last evening edition carried an interesting comment : NATURAL DEATH OR SUICIDE ? Yesterday Simeon Barchet , a high executive of the nowfamous Beller Research Laboratories , died suddenly of a heart attack . According to his colleagues at Beller , Mr. Barchet had been in a despondent frame of mind and had  | left firmly worded instructions that no attempt be made to reanimate him . The Barchet incident reveals a new facet of the already explosive reanimation situation . Can willful refusal to undergo reanimation be considered a form of suicide ? Our society has always regarded suicide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffering , and the teachings of many religious groups hold self-destruction to be a mortal sin . According to time-honored principles of civil law , suicide and particularly attempted suicide are deemed illegal acts . In this case , the odd paradox arises of a man already dead committing what can only be termed suicide . Presumably others who die in the coming era of reanimation will make similar efforts to avoid being brought back to life . If reanimation should be given the stamp of federal approval as a result of the forthcoming Congressional investigations , then it is clear that a testament forbidding one 's heirs to attempt reanimation will , if honored , reach beyond the grave to bind a dead person 's survivors , counsel , and physicians in a conspiracy to abet suicide . Obviously this is a sensitive issue . It demonstrates once again that the staggering achievement of the Beller process , which has the capability of transforming death into a merely temporary phenomenon , will unavoidably bring about a massive revolution in our codes of legal and medical ethics , and indeed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heap of newspapers , Harker began to feel for the first time that the tide was turning . The early hysteria was dying down . People were realizing that reanimation was no grisly joke , no hoax , but something real and powerful that had already entered the world and could not now be easily driven out . There no longer were many demands for wholesale suppression of the process . A Fundamentalist minister from Kansas had gained some quick publicity by calling for immediate destruction of all equipment used in the reanimation technique , as well as prohibition of its use , but his was now an isolated voice .  | The tone of the Star-Post editorial seemed to be the tone of the consensus . Men of intelligence were saying , Reanimation exists , for good or evil . Let 's study it for a while and find out what it can do for us and how it will change society . Let 's not scream for its suppression , but on the other hand let 's not unleash it before we know what forces we 're letting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had belonged to Clyde Thurman , and that voice now was stilled . What had been done to Thurman had been an act of colossal audacity or thoughtlessness or both , and even now Harker found it difficult to live with the unendurable memory of staring into the noble old warrior 's mindless eyes ; but , he had to admit , kidnaping Thuinian had silenced a potent advocate for the banning of the Beller process . Perhaps these are times for violent actions , Harker thought . In that case I 'm the wrong man for this job . But it 's too late to help that now . Sunday 's papers continued the general trend toward reasonable consideration of the case for reanimation , and they also reported no progress in the search for the missing Senator . Nevertheless , the reanimation hearings were going to begin on schedule on Monday  --  not in Washington , though , but in New York . Late Sunday evening a messenger appeared at Harker 's door and handed him a document . It was a subpoena , requesting him to be present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harker got there half an hour early . The hearings were taking place in a meeting room on the nineteenth floor of the hotel . The whole floor was thronged with reporters ? Harker had to fight his way through them , no-commenting at every step of the way  --  and television cameras were already set up . At the back of the room Harker saw the four Senators who had visited the labs that day with Thurman : Brewster , Vorys , Dixon , Westmore . Two American-Con-  | servatives , two National-Liberals . The fifth seat had been left vacant in an ostentatiously symbolic way . Mart Raymond was sitting down front , wearing not his stained lab smock but a surprisingly natty dress suit , all metallic fibers and plunging lines . Vogel had been subpoenaed , too , but not Lurie . Next to Raymond sat a plumpish , middle-aged woman Harker had never seen before ; she was dressed in clothes at least thirty years out of date and looked like a bitter caricature of a suburban clubwoman . Raymond made the introduction . " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's been acting as liaison between the laboratory and the Beller fund since Barchet died . " " Dreadful about poor Mr. Barchet , " the woman said . Her voice was down in the baritone range : firm , well-modulated , commanding , the voice of a D.A.R . chairlady , the voice of a lady Senator . " I 'm pleased to meet you , Mr. Harker . I 've heard so much about you . My late husband was deeply interested in your career . " I 'll bet he was , Harker thought . Darwin F. Beller had been one of the pillars of the American-Conservative Party ; millions of his sanctified , free-enterprise dollars had flowed into the treasury of that party , and a good many thousands of them had gone to Harker 's electoral opponents . Harker knew he must have been high in the ranks of Beller 's private demonology . But he was n't sure if Mrs. Beller was putting him on or simply naive , and he responded in a vaguely gracious way , making a quick escape . He looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grim , Vory peeved ; Dixon and Westmore , the Nat-Lib members of the committee , wore identical uneasy smiles . Network cameramen seemed to be under foot everywhere , checking camera angles , adjusting mike booms , testing the lighting . A small , harried-looking man with close-cropped hair came scurrying up to him , jabbed a pencil microphone under his nose , and said , " Mr. Harker , would you mind saying a couple of words into this for us ? "  | " What would you like me to say ? " " That 's fine , sir . " Just a voice test , Harker realized . " Now you , Mr. Raymond , and then after that I 'd like to hear the lady speak . " Someone yelled out a moment later , " Harker 's fine ! Raymond could use more resonance ! " " Would you mind getting more chest into your voice , Mr. Raymond ? " " I 'll do my best , " Raymond said . The man with the microphone scurried away . Harker watched the time on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten . The room was rapidly filling up , not only with media people . Raymond pointed out two wellknown medical men ; Harker spotted two distinguished lawyers , including one who had issued a ringing denunciation of reanimation a week before . At ten o'clock sharp Senator Westmore rose , smiled almost apologetically into one of the video cameras , and said , " Good morning , ladies and gentlemen . As acting chairman of the Senate Special Investigating Subcommittee dealing with the problems raised by the discoveries of the Beller Research Laboratories , I hereby ask for your attention and call this hearing to order . " The room fell silent . In the hush , the throbbing purr of the official stenographer 's recording machine was clearly audible . After a pause Westmore went on , " We begin this session in the absence of our respected chairman , Senator Thurman of New York . I 'm sure you 'll all join me in the hope that the beloved Senator is safe , wherever he may be , and that his perplexing and extraordinary absence will soon be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delicate ? ? nature of the Beller discoveries , and the extreme intensity of the public reaction to them , make it imperative that this committee elicit facts and present its findings to the Senate immediately , and so we are proceeding as scheduled despite our chairman 's absence . " Our purpose is to draw forth information on the subject  | of the so-called reanimation process . I think it would be well to begin with the director of the laboratory which developed the technique , Dr. Martin Raymond . " Raymond rose , a trifle awkwardly . As he came forward , Senator Vorys requested permission to question him . Vory 's voice was thin and penetrating . " Dr. Raymond , you recognize me , do you not , as a member of the group of Senators who visited your lab recently ? " " I recognize you , yes . " " In our presence you applied your reanimation technique to a twelve-year-old boy . Am I correct ? " " You are . " " The boy was dead ? " " He had drowned the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " And where is this boy now ? " Raymond said , " Recuperating from the aftereffects of his experience . He 's in good health , but still pretty weak . " " Ah . Would it be possible for you to bring this boy to a session of these hearings ? " " I do n't believe so , Senator . The boy 's not ready for any traveling yet . I imagine he 'll need several more weeks of hospitalization . And in any case , these are open hearings . It would violate one of our fundamental policies to present him before the public unless his identity were completely shielded . Which would greatly limit the sort of questioning you could do . " " Why do you insist on such privacy ? " " To protect our subjects . Reanimation is still in its early stages . The social implications of having been reanimated are still unclear . We do n't want to mark any of our people as a returnee until we know how such people will be received in the world at large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if the members of this committee paid a visit to the boy in the hospital ? Simply to ascertain the current state of his health ? " " That could be arranged , " Raymond said .  | " Very well . We 'll take it up after the session . " Vorys paused a moment , staring keenly at Raymond , and said , " Would you trace briefly for us the history of your laboratory , the nature of your process , and the results you have obtained so far ? " Speaking freely and easily now , Raymond told of the original Beller bequest , the gathering together of the laboratory staff , the years of theoretical research , the early experimental failures , the first successes . He outlined a rough sketch of the technology of the technique in its present form . " To date we 've had about seventy human reanimalions , " he concluded . " And how many failures ? " " About ten out of the seventy . You understand that I 'm talking only about the period since reanimation has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had thirty consecutive failures . " " I see . And what is the nature of these failures ? " Raymond began to fidget . " Ah  --  well , we do n't succeed in restoring life . " " The body remains inanimate ? " " Yes . Most of the time , that is . In some cases  --  I mean ? " Too late . Vorys pounced gleefully on the slip and said , " Most of the time , Dr. Raymond ? I do n't quite understand . Does that mean that some of your failures are actually instances where reanimation has been achieved and the patient then dies again ? Or is there some kind of partial reanimation  --  say , the brain begins to function but the body remains inert ? I 'd be happy if you 'd make yourself clear . " Raymond shot a panicky glance at Harker , who shrugged and nodded in resignation . It would have come out eventually , he thought . This was n't the place he would have chosen for it , but at least it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Raymond was a pitiful sight under the merciless lights . He said in a hopeless voice , " I guess I ought to be more specific . " " Please , Dr. Raymond . " " Well , " Raymond said , " Counting the boy we reani-  | mated the day you visited us , Senator , we 've had seventytwo reanimations since the first success . No , seventy-three . In sixty-two of those cases , we 've achieved total restoration of normal life processes . In four others , it did not prove possible for us to restore life at all . And in the remaining seven ? " Raymond hesitated ? " in the remaining seven we achieved reanimation with only partial success . " " Partial in what way ? " Vorys pressed . Raymond had run out of evasions . Desperately he said , " We managed to restore the bodies of those seven to functional activity  --  respiration , circulation , all the vital signs . But in those seven cases we were unable to achieve a comparable restoration of the functions of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unintended and unwillingly disgorged revelation . Even the traditionally sedate Times devoted six of its eight columns to a banner headline above a story which began with this lead : Public faith in the Beller reanimation process was seriously shaken today by the surprising revelation that mental defects may be among the side effects of a reanimation . Dr. Martin Raymond , head of the Beller research organization , made the statement in New York at the opening session of Senate reanimation hearings . He declared that seven out of seventy-three experimental human reanimations had produced what he characterized as " mindless beings . " In four other instances , neither body nor mind was successfully recalled to life . In the other papers it was even worse . The Star-Post , which had been growing more sympathetic each day , demanded at the top of its editorial column : WHY HAVE THEY BEEN HIDING THIS ? Out of town , where sympathy with the cause of reanimation had never been particularly warm , tempers grew short and prose became apoplectic . A syndicated columnist la-  | beled the Beller researchers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ugly probability of catching on and spreading . At the Litchfield headquarters , the flood of abusive mail threatened to overpower the local postmaster . It was impossible to read it all , or even to get a comprehensive sampling , and after Harker picked up a scrawled letter that threatened assassination of him and his entire family unless reanimation experiments ceased , he decided not to look at any of it . They stored the hate mail in one of the supply buildings in back . On the second day of the hearings there were a few new faces in the room . They were faces Harker did not particularly enjoy seeing : those of Cal Mitchison and David Klaus . With them was their lawyer , Gerhardt . Since Senator Thurman had still not been found , Brewster presided over the second session  --  a heavyset , slow-moving man with a ponderously tenacious style of mind . Once he had the opening formalities out of the way Brewster said , " Let us hear now from Dr. David Klaus , formerly of the staff of the Beller Research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Senator Brewster , I 'd like to enter an objection . This man is one of the principals in a lawsuit pending against our laboratory . Anything he says here this morning is certain to be self-serving and bound to be prejudicial to us in the lawsuit . " Brewster shook his head calmly . " This is not a court of law , Mr. Harker . We 're attempting to put the Beller process in its proper perspective , and I see no reason to exclude testimony that may be hostile to your position . We 're interested in listening to Dr. Klaus 's statements . You 'll have ample time to refute them later , if you wish . " Harker subsided . Brewster turned to Klaus , who stood with his hands knotted nervously together . Thin , slab-jawed , scrawny , Klaus seemed almost a parody of the supposed image of the scientific prodigy . Brewster said , " Dr. Klaus , you were formerly employed by the Beller Laboratories in  | a high technical post , were you not ? Would you mind telling us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual , Klaus said , " I was discharged by order of James Harker shortly after he came to work there . It was a purely arbitrary and malicious act , motivated , I believe , by the failure of a bureaucrat like Harker to comprehend the scientific process . Since things did n't go the way he wanted them to , I was made the scapegoat . " Harker fumed , but an imperious wave from Brewster kept him quiet . The Senator said , " Let 's not have personal recriminations entering this testimony , Dr. Klaus . How long were you employed at the Beller Laboratories ? " " Three years . I was in charge of enzyme research . " " I see . And were you aware that the experiments in human reanimation were occasionally producing  --  ah  --  idiots ? " " Yes , sir . We were all aware of that . " " Were attempts being made to safeguard the experimental subjects against this unfortunate result , Dr. Klaus ? " " Yes , " Klaus said . " Work was proceeding along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of supplementing existing brain tissue ; I regarded this as hopeless and impossible . However , my department was simultaneously working on a chemical method of insuring full recovery of mental powers . I imagine that since my dismissal this group has been dismantled , and ? " " He 's lying ! " Raymond shouted . " His department never had anything to do with ? " " Please , Mr. Raymond , " Brewster said fiercely . " There 'll be time for rebuttals . " To Klaus he said , " Do you feel that this hazard of the reanimation process can be overcome in the course of further research along the lines you say you were following ? " " Definitely . But the present management of the lab is heading in the wrong direction . They rejected my ideas and got rid of me just as I was reaching the threshold of a solution , and persisted in their own misguided efforts . Which I suppose they 've abandoned now , since they 're smart enough  | to know they ca n't get anywhere . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ask Harker how much he heard about the mental-defect problem when he received his first briefings on the Beller process from Dr. Raymond . " Harker felt his pulse mounting . Klaus seemed icily calm up there , speaking now with a cold precision that was most unusual for him . He was finding all the vulnerable spots , too . He sounded as if he had rehearsed his lines very carefully . Brewster said , " It would seem to me that the directors of the Beller Laboratories were guilty of acts of bad faith in attempting to conceal this problem prior to Dr. Raymond 's apparently inadvertent revelation of it at the first session of these hearings . Would n't you agree , Dr. Klaus ? " " Definitely , sir . " " Thank you . Mr. Harker , will you come forward ? " Harker stepped into the spotlight . As he assumed the role of witness , he was relieved to see Senator Brewster give place to Senator Dixon , who was bound to be more gentle : American-Conservative Senators sometimes had a way of conducting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spanish Inquisition , and Harker had not expected Brewster to be gentle with him . Dixon said , " Would you tell us how you became affiliated with the Beller outfit , Mr. Harker ? " " I was approached by one of the lab 's ranking scientists , a Dr. Lurie , " Harker said . " I had retired to private law practice at the end of my term as Governor of New York . Dr. Lurie asked me to handle the legal aspects of reanimation ? to become counsel to the laboratory , in effect ? " " Ah . How long ago was this ? " " Dr. Lurie first approached me on May 8 . Roughly three weeks ago , Senator Dixon . " " And you 've acted as spokesman for the laboratory since then ? " " No , sir . My first public statement for Beller appeared on  | May zo . We were n't quite ready to release any information , but we were forced to take action after the premature and unauthorized release of data to the public by Dr. Klaus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This was the act of insubordination for which they were dismissed from the laboratory . " " You say that the first public announcement of the Beller reanimation experiments was made without your knowledge , and that you would have prevented the announcement if you had been aware it was going to be made ? " " That 's right , sir . " " Why did you intend to maintain continued secrecy ? " " Secrecy 's not exactly the right shade of meaning , " Harker said . " It 's more a matter of not rushing off half-cocked to proclaim a miracle to the world until the miracle exists . The reanimation process was n't quite perfect , as of the beginning of May . Perhaps a few more weeks of work would have eliminated the possibility of loss of mental functions . Since so many years of work had already gone into the effort , we saw no reason for announcing anything until we had attained all of our goals . But Dr. Klaus took it upon himself to inform the world against my wishes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambitions . Thanks to him , there was no time to prepare society for the impact of what we 've accomplished , and no opportunity to bring the process to final perfection . " Harker glanced at Brewster and Vorys , his two adversaries on this panel . They were frowning , but it seemed to him that the frowns were expressions of contemplation , not hostility . Perhaps he actually was getting through to them . Perhaps . Perhaps . Dixon said , " Could you tell us how close you are to actual elimination of this hazard of loss of mental function ? " " Sorry , I ca n't . That 's something you 'd have to find out from Dr. Raymond . But I will say that research at our laboratory has virtually ceased during this period of turmoil and upheaval , so that any solution to the problem is in limbo for the time being . "  | There was a whispered conference at the dais . Abruptly Vorys replaced Dixon as interrogator . " Mr. Harker , does the name Wayne Janson mean anything to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now the real attack was beginning . He said , " Yes , Senator Vorys . According to the newspapers , Janson was a New Yorker who committed suicide last week by jumping off a bridge . " " His name means nothing else to you ? " " No . " " No one of that name underwent reanimation at the Beller Laboratories ? " " No , sir . " Vorys paused momentarily . " There 's reason to believe that the late Mr. Janson underwent reanimation several months before you became affiliated with Beller . Is it possible that he did experience treatment there , and that you do n't know about it ? " Harker said , " When the rumor that Janson was a former Beller research subject cropped up , I examined the list of subjects since the beginning of reanimation studies . There 's no one named Wayne Janson on that list . " " Perhaps he entered under another name . " " We have photographs of all patients , Senator . None of them corresponded to the photo of Mr. Janson that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject , I assure you , and Janson simply was n't involved in any reanimation attempt . " " Then you 're denying he was ever a patient of the labo-ratories ? " " Exactly . " " But a close friend of the late Mr. Janson , a man of some reputation , claims that Mr. Janson did secretly enter the Beller Laboratories of his own will shortly before his death of natural causes , died , and was reanimated , and suffered such mental disturbance as a consequence of reanimation  | that within a few months he found it necessary to take his own life . " Quietly Harker said , " It 's obvious that somebody 's lying , is n't it ? Our records indicate that no such person ever entered the labs for treatment . We 're willing to take oath to that . The burden of proof , I believe , rests with the other party . " " We have only your word for this , " Vorys went on obstinately . " And an oath  --  well , Mr. Harker , we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you make these records of yours available to this committee 's inspection ? " " It would be against our policy . " " We could subpoena the records , " Vorys warned . Harker shrugged . " That 's within your rights , of course . But exposure of the names of our patients would probably have adverse effects on them , psychologically and otherwise . As a matter of medical ethics we feel we have to shield them . " " That sounds very good , Mr. Harker . But it could also be an excuse for hiding something . " " Hiding what ? If Janson had really undergone reanimation , we 'd admit it . We 've already admitted that there occasionally are failures in the process . But we ca n't admit to the Janson case , because we had no connection with it . " " So you claim . " Resisting the impulse to lose his temper  --  for Vorys was obviously baiting him deliberately , trying to goad him into some rash confession  --  Harker said , " I believe it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our records . Perhaps it would be necessary still to conceal the names of the subjects , but we could let you check somatic typology , fingerprints , plasma density , anything of that nature which would identify Janson beyond doubt . Of course the inspection would have to be private . " " And of course you could easily delete the Janson file from the records before we got to see anything . " Harker sighed . " You 're being unreasonable , Senator .  | You 're asking us to prove ourselves not guilty of having reanimated Wayne Janson . How could we ever prove that to your satisfaction ? I think it 's up to Jonathan Bryant &; Company to demonstrate that we did put Janson through the process . Until there 's some evidence of that , I think we can rest on our denial . " " Very well , Mr. Harker , " said Vorys tightly . " Thank you . I wo n't pursue the point further at this time . We will recess now for one hour . " Mart Raymond came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are getting rough , eh ? " Harker nodded . " Vorys and Brewster are out for our scalps . It 's got to be political . The Conservatives obviously are going to come down hard against reanimation . " " I 'm sorry about letting that business slip yesterday , Jim . " " " Forget it . It had to come out sooner or later , and maybe if we had announced it at the start we would n't be having so much trouble now . Well , it could n't be helped . Let 's go get some lunch . " As they rode down to the hotel dining room Harker said , " Exactly how close are you to getting the bugs out of the process ? " Raymond looked vague . " A week , a month , maybe a year . We think we know what causes the mental breakdown ? some of the time . It seems to be a matter of hormone impurity : we literally pollute the brain sometimes in the very process of bringing it back to life . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it , and I 'm pretty sure we can find a way around it . That covers a good percentage of our failures . Of course , in some cases there 's that moment-ofdeath cerebral damage , the jolt to the ego that I was telling you about , and I do n't think we can lick that , any more than we can revive a man who 's been blown apart by dynamite . But I 'm confident that we 'll lick the other thing . " " And when you do , what do you think your average probability of successful reanimations is going to be ? " Shrugging , Raymond said , " Who knows ? Maybe we 'll get  | nine out of ten . Maybe ninety-five out of a hundred . Or ninety-nine out of a hundred . Until we have ten or twenty thousand case histories behind us , our statistics are n't going to be worth much . " They ate quietly . Harker brooded over the morning 's session , hoping he had discredited Jonathan Bryant and the Mitehison-Klaus combine by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see that Mitchison and Klaus were nothing more than vengeful power seekers and that the whole Wayne Janson affair was simply a clumsy , malicious hoax . But he overestimated the ability of the media people to distinguish truth from slung mud , it seemed  --  or else everyone wanted to go for a good story at his expense . The earlyafternoon papers were already emerging from the slots by the time the hearing resumed in the afternoon . The headline on the Star-Post was : KLAUS SAYS HARKER FIRED HIM ; CHARGES BELLER " BAD FAITH " The story , slanted heavily in Klaus 's favor , implied that the enzyme man had been on the verge of a brilliant scientific discovery when Harker , jealous of Klaus 's eminence in the laboratory , coldly sacked him . As for the Janson case , the piece referred to Harker 's " uncomfortable evasions " and " unconvincing denials . " So the tide was turning again . The fancy of the public had seized on the one fact , grotesque and horrifying enough , that in a few cases reanimation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to destroy the fabric of rationality that Harker had managed to construct . Now , once more , a massive movement aimed at the total supression of reanimation was beginning to take form and grow in strength . The early opposition to the Beller process had been almost entirely irrational , a mere wave of ignorant hysteria . What seemed to be getting under way now was something else :  | equally hysterical , but not at all irrational now that reanimation had been shown to have perils previously unsuspected . Harker had felt the power of the great , insane , raging tide of public opinion at other times . He feared it now . He had the uncomfortable feeling that only a miracle could save things . And miracles , in this secular age , were difficult matters to arrange . As the hearing ground along into the third day , and the fourth , and then the fifth and the sixth , things grew even worse . The " zombie " phrase became a favorite , not only of the press and the public , but even of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seventy-three reanimation subjects had been revived sans intellect had become the main issue . In his rare moments of relaxation , Harker wondered occasionally how the world would react if word ever escaped that one of those seven had been the missing Senator Thurman . Very much as Harker had expected , the American-Conservatives intensified their previous belief in " caution " into what amounted to condemnation of the whole process . Maxwell of Vermont , the Senate Minority Leader , delivered what was billed as an off-the-cuff speech  --  most likely it had been computer-crafted to a high polish well in advance ? at a Chicago gathering of American-Conservative committeemen , in which he referred to reanimation as " that frightening mess engineered by a one-time lame-duck radical , that unholy conspiracy against human dignity , that newest National-Liberal crime against civilization . " Harker was familiar enough with the standard Conservative style of invective , but he was still shaken by the blatant attempt to make reanimation somehow into a project of one political party . Later the same day , the Nat-Lib national chairman was quick to announce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ official party connections back in January , was now solely a private citizen , and in no way represented the views of the National-Liberal Party . It was a neat and accurate disavowal that took the Nat-Libs off the hook on which Maxwell had tried to impale them , but left them an avenue of re-entry just in case public opinion should swing the other way again . The Nat-Libs had n't repudiated reanimation , exactly  --  only Harker . Work at the laboratory had come practically to a standstill . " If we only had a few more weeks of peace , " Raymond mourned , " we might be able to beat the remaining defects and show the public something flawless . But they wo n't let us alone and we ca n't get anything done . " A week after the start of the hearings , the four investigating Senators and a phalanx of FBI men had visited the laboratory , at Mart Raymond 's reluctant invitation , to check out the Wayne Janson business . After getting assurances that everything would be held in confidence , Raymond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Brewster kept pointing out that the inspection did n't mean a thing , since it would n't have been very difficult to tamper with the files in order to remove all trace of the Janson reanimation . Harker had to admit privately that their suspicions were well founded , for , after all , the reanimators were in fact concealing one of their unhappy projects : the Thurman experiment . Harker had insisted that nothing about that go into the data bank . But , although the investigators continued to grumble , they were unable to find any trace of tampering , any evidence whatever that a Janson reanimation had been carried out and the records of it deleted . A small victory , Harker thought . He was getting paranoid enough these days to have started wondering whether Jonathan Bryant might have been telling the truth about Janson and Mart Raymond lying . But no : there had never been a Janson reanimation , and even the FBI appeared to be willing to accept the condition of the laboratory files as bona fide . A story in the Times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the FBI findings : that there was nothing in the Beller records to show that such a reanimation had taken place , and that the private documents of Janson himself showed no indication that he had been in contact with the Beller staff or that he had even heard of the laboratory . Harker assumed that the incident would end there . It had to be apparent to everyone that Jonathan Bryant had perpetrated a flimsy hoax solely for the sake of discrediting reanimation and arousing popular fears against it . But again Harker was wrong . The day after the FBI 's exoneration of the laboratory was made public , Jonathan Bryant testified before the investigating committee . The questioner was Senator Vorys . The interchange between them was widely reported in that evening 's late editions : VORYS : You knew the late Wayne Janson well ? BRYANT : I was his closest friend . VORYS : When did he first mention reanimation to you ? BRYANT : About the middle of January . He said his doctor had told him about the experiments going on over in New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor ? BRYANT : I 'm sorry , Senator Vorys , I do n't know that . VORYS : Very well . Go ahead . He had learned of the Beller experiments . And then ? BRYANT : Well , Wayne suffered a severe stroke in February and he told me soon afterward that he was going to go to Litch field , that he felt his next stroke might be fatal and it might come at any moment , so he was going to volunteer and make himself available for reanimation . His philosophy at the time was that he had nothing to lose and a great deal to gain VORYS ( interrupting ) : The FBI did check and found that Janson had been away from his home during February and March . BRYANT : Yes , sir . That 's correct . Well , Janson came home late in March and told me of his experiences . How he had actually been dead for the better part of a day after having had another stroke , and how he woke up and  | found himself alive again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I thought it was marvelous that such things were possible . But he seemed moody , depressed , very different from usual . For a man who 'd been rescued that way , he was terribly down all the time . Nothing but scowls and groans and grim broodings . I tried to get him back into his normally cheerful frame of mind , but nothing would work . He was altogether changed in a psychological way , in a personality way . Then one night several weeks ago , not long after my father 's death , Wayne phoned me and said he was going to end it all , going to jump off the George Washington Bridge . He told me that there had been morbid changes in his brain as a result of his having undergone the Beller treatment , that the chemicals or something had actually altered his personality and left him unbearably depressed . He talked of feeling empty and without a soul . I tried to prevent him from killing himself but I was unable to reach him in time . VORYS : You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement to the effect that to the best of their knowledge Janson never had any contact with the Beller people ? BRYANT : Of course . The key phrase there , Senator , is " to the best of their knowledge . " I do n't mean to minimize the FBI , but I have no doubt that the Beller people have suppressed the records of the Wayne Janson case just as they 've suppressed so many other disturbing things since James Harker started running that outfit . The ten-minute colloquy between Vorys and Bryant , widely quoted and republished everywhere , served not only to discredit the FBI report utterly , but to convince a majority of the public that Harker had indeed suppressed the records of the Janson reanimation . A fine business , Harker thought . A magnificent scientific discovery discredited because of a failure factor of less than 10 per cent . Public opinion disastrously swayed by one man 's bitter determination to crush an old enemy with any lies that happened to be handy . Harker studied the newspapers each day with increasing  | bitterness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that many of death 's victims could actually be snatched back from his grasp  --  seemed to be disappearing under the welter of side issues : the jackal-like snapping of Klaus-Mitchison and Bryant , the fencing of the two great political parties , the hysteria of uninformed people faced with something new and beyond easy comprehension . Only one issue had not been raised yet  --  luckily , for it was the deadliest of all , having a real basis of truth . No one had accused the Beller people of murdering Senator Thurman . It was a logical accusation , making a good deal more sense than most of the insane charges already raised . After all , Thurman had been the most vigorous and most important of the enemies of reanimation , and he had disappeared right on the eve of the hearings . It seemed incredible to Harker that no one would think of implying that the Beller group had done away with their tough , intractable foe . But no one raised the cry , perhaps because it was too obvious . Harker wondered how long their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grateful for that momentary impulse of steely purposefulness that had led him to condemn Barchet to death . Of the six people who had known the fate of Senator Thurman , Barchet had been the most unstable , the one most likely to crack and reveal the truth . And Barchet was out of the picture now . The eighth day of the hearing came and went ; Vorys grilled poor , gawky Lurie mercilessly on minor scientific details , driving him into an agony of twitches and tremors , while Brewster got Vogel to explain some of the surgical fine points of the reanimation technique . " You have to admire those two boys , " Harker said after that session . " They 've been well briefed . They 've really brushed up on their science . " " I have n't had a quizzing like that since I took my medi-  | cal degree , " Vogel said , nervously tugging at the dark strands of his beard . " And for what purpose ? " Raymond wanted to know . " What 's the point of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know about us . Continuing the hearing is just a waste of the taxpayers ' money . " Harker nodded gloomily . You only had to pick up any newspaper , listen to any relatively right-wing news commentator , attend any church , even walk in the street and talk to people at random . The response was the same everywhere . Fear . Fear of reanimation ; fear of that one chance out of six that the outcome would be a zombie . Desperately Harker tried to counteract that swelling tide of fear . He tapped the Beller Fund for money for a full-page ad in the Times and wrote the copy himself . The heading was : WHY THROW OUT THE BABY WITH THE BATH WATER ? His line of argument was that the reanimation process should not be condemned for its occasional failures , but rather praised for its many successes . The technique was in the early stages , the experimental years . Some failures were inevitable . What if aviation had been suppressed because of the early crashes ? Research had to continue . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsible places ; the Times itself echoed Harker 's reasoning in its editorial the next day , pointing out how improbable it was that so bold an achievement as the reanimation process would attain perfection so soon . But Harker sensed that he was not reaching the people . And the people feared reanimation . The hearing rolled along into early July , and then one day Dixon announced that this was the last week ; the committee would enter private deliberations preparatory to delivering its findings to the Senate as a whole . Harker went up to the Wyoming liberal afterward and asked him how good . y . rye fir+  | he thought the chances were for approval of the Beller process . Dixon frowned quizzically . " Hard to say . The committee 's deadlocked two-and-two , you see . We may fight all summer about it and then turn in two reports . " " Vorys and Brewster are firm against us ? " " Absolutely . They 're listening to the voice of the people , and the people are screaming hysterically . Every minority party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's the way to become a majority party again , I suppose . " Harker said doubtfully , " Where do we stand in the inner Nat-Lib circles ? " Dixon shrugged . " Right now , the feeling runs toward taking over the Beller Labs and continuing reanimation research under federal supervision  --  with you and Raymond still in charge of things , of course . " " We 'd like that fine . " " Do n't get your hopes too high , " Dixon warned . " The party 's divided , and we do n't see any real way of holding our bloc together when it comes to the critical vote . The way the public is getting worked up over your process , it looks bad for passing any kind of measure that seems sympathetic . " " Is this going to turn into a race between the liberals and the conservatives for knocking us down ? " " Jim , I do n't need to lecture you on political expediency . You tried to knock down a bunch of stone walls when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the voters say , Junk reanimation , then we 'll have to junk it . " " Junk it ? As simple as that ? Junk a miraculous medical technique the way you junked a troublesome Governor ? " " I 'm afraid so , " Dixon said . " It 's this business of the seven idiots , Jim . That frightens people more than you seem to realize . " " But we can lick that problem eventually . " " Maybe you can . But the voters do n't believe that . They 've heard too many promises . Besides , people think only in terms  | of the short range on a thing like this . And they 're more afraid of having a sister or a nephew turn into a zombie than they are of death . After all , suppose you 've had your son or your wife or your father reanimated and you end up with a zombie on your hands . What do you do ? Kill him ? You ca n't do that . So you go on supporting an idiot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " I think we can get over that particular hump soon . " " If you can , then reanimation 's in , Jim . But you 've got to move fast . Once you pass a certain critical point , you 'll never win the public back . Not that the Beller process could be abolished altogether now . It exists ; it 's here . But it can be batted around in committee and side-channeled and circumvented and railroaded for twenty years before the time becomes ripe for popular acceptance . And we may have to do that to you , though I hope to hell we do n't . " " Do you think that 's what 's going to happen ? " Again the sad smile . " Read the newspapers , man . Read your mail ! " Harker read his mail . He ploughed through hundreds of letters , sorting them and making heaps of them : favorable on one side , unfavorable on the other . The favorable ones struck him as sweet , pious , bland , empty . The others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was about three inches high ; the stack of hostile ones grew so tall it toppled over , and he started a new one beside it . They were letters of raw , unbridled hate , most of them . The kind of thing that went , My beloved mother/father/sister **32;518;TOOLONG /grandmother/grandfather died last week , and I want to tell you that she/he had a decent Christian burial and went to his/her eternal repose . Naturally I feel sorrow at my loss , but I 'd rather be dead myself than let anyone I loved get into your filthy godless hands . Sure , maybe you 'll bring him/her back to life  --  but  | who wants to see the hollow mindless shell of someone you once loved ? Not me , brother . Not me . So take your zombie machine and crawl back under whatever rock you came out from . The faster the better . America wo n't be a clean place again until you disappear . It was an enlarging experience to read those letters . Even when he had held public office and was crusading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or such passionate letters . The flow was astonishing . His correspondents gloated in the triumph of death , they thanked God that they had not allowed their beloved ones to undergo reanimation , they offered foul curses for Harker and his whole family . He was the target of their hate , the symbol for reanimation . For them he personified all the loathsome scientific advances that had made life so much more complicated and perilous and incomprehensible since their ancestors left Eden . At first he was irritated , then angered ; anger passed , and turned into compassion . Perhaps some of these same people had written to him a month before , pleading to have a member of their family restored to them by this new scientific miracle . Now confused by the maze of conflicting tales , of lies and partial truths , their earlier willingness to embrace reanimation had soured into hatred . Harker wearily baled the letters up again and got away from the laboratory , going home to spend a little time with his puzzled , unhappy family . The boys were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; publicity was old stuff to them . But this public hatred was new to them , and difficult for them to understand . Even the younger boy was aware of the denunciations his father was receiving . At school his classmates asked him how many zombies his father had made that day . It was still not too late to halt the slide into chaos , Harker thought . The forces of confusion could yet be put to rout . But he had to win the faith of the public . Some spectacular  | demonstration , some bold , symbolic gesture that would capture the popular imagination and end the sway of ignorance . But what ? How ? Harker had no answers . And the answers , when they came , arrived from a most unexpected source . At Litchfield again , the next day , Harker was reading through a laboratory report , comprehending not very much of it , when a diffident knock sounded at his door . Probably Lurie with the newspapers , he thought . " Come in ! A slim figure in ecclesiastical robes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never expected to see you here , Monsignor Carteret . " " Nor I. But I thought it would be useful if I made the trip . " " Please sit down . Useful , Monsignor ? How ? " " Jim , I asked you to come to me if you ever found yourself troubled . You 're troubled now , and perhaps you could n't find the time to visit me . I thought I 'd drop in and see if I could be of any help . " Harker felt faintly annoyed . He liked the priest , but owed him no allegiance , and felt no desire for unasked advice . " Monsignor , if you 've come to tell me I ought to quit this project while I still have my soul , forget it . " " The time for telling you that is past . " Harker stared coolly at the priest . " Then why are you here ? " " To help you . I know , I know , you think I 'm a sneaky Papist meddler and you wish I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have a suggestion for you , a rather strange one . Before we go into that , though : let me tell you that the Church is reconsidering its stand . " " What ? " Carteret smiled gently . " The Church moves slowly ; do n't  | anticipate anything for the next several years , at least . But I 've had conversations with Rome . I have it on good understanding that when your technique is perfect  --  that is , when you have the capability of restoring body and mind every time  --  the Church will lift its ban on reanimation . " " You have to be joking . " " No . You ca n't imagine the extent of the debate that 's raging . The prevailing feeling in Rome , though , is that we must n't let ourselves be caught on the reactionary side of a technological development ever again . So , while we wo n't rush to put the imprimatur on reanimation , we also wo n't offer theological arguments against it  --  if you can perfect it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I know . But we ca n't accept the process in its present form , and we 're not the only ones who feel this way . I 'm sure that you 'll solve the technical problems involved . I 've been praying for your success , Jim . " " You ? But you warned me to keep away from this thing ! " Carteret nodded . " And you went into it anyway . And perhaps I made an error in judgment when I warned you away . I 've come to see reanimation in a different light lately . And I 've admired the bravery of your campaign . " " Kind of you to say it . But it 's all immaterial now . Reanimation is going to be squashed by Congress anyway . " " What do you mean ? " " Simply that the defect in the process has aroused such intense public horror that Congress is afraid to pass any legislation that favors us . " " And you do n't expect to overcome the defect ? " " Not immediately . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  but by that time it 'll be too late . " Reflectively steepling his long , thin fingers , Carteret said , " You 're telling me , in other words , that your real problem is a failure of public relations . You need time to perfect your process , but you do n't think Congress will give you the time , on account of popular outcries against you . But if  | you could sell your product to the people , Congress would follow along . " " That 's about right , " Harker said . " Very well . It 's about as I expected . Now , this suggestion I have for you ? " " Yes ? " " It 's an idea for capturing the stream of public opinion . I 'm eager to see your project succeed , Jim . I want death to be banished from the world , despite all the theological complications implied in that . That may sound strange , coming from my lips , but it 's the truth . I suffered to reach this view . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled oddly . " It 's one that bears the test of time , Jim . Our Saviour , remember , went meekly to the Cross , though surely He could have avoided such a fate if He had wanted to . And on the third day He rose . It was an act that has captured the imaginations and hearts of men and women for two thousand years . " Harker frowned . " I do n't quite see ? " He stopped . Abruptly the deeper meaning of the priest 's words was borne in on him , and he stared at Carteret aghast , wondering . " Would you do something like that ? " Harker asked . " If I had faith in my cause , and thought that this would help my cause , I would , " Carteret said . " Without any hesitation . Do you have faith in yours ? " Hesitantly Harker said , " I think so . " " Faith in your cause and faith in your process . And then you need have no fears . There 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awhile . Do n't rush yourself . I 'll leave you now and let you get used to the idea . " Alone , Harker stared through the office window at the dark , rain-streaked sky outside . Summer lightning crackled suddenly across the darkness ; moments later , thunder came rolling down from the hills . A cold sweat came over him as he revolved Carteret 's  | words in his mind . Our Saviour went meekly to the Cross . And on the third day He rose . Madness . Idiocy . Or was it so crazy a suggestion ? Was there not a core of Jesuitical shrewdness in it ? To give oneself  --  to make the ultimate surrender for one 's cause  --  and then to rise again , one 's faith fulfilled .. . Do I dare , though ? It was , he knew without doubt , the act that would settle the fate of reanimation for good . If it succeeded , nothing could hold back the triumph of the process ; if it failed , unquestionably it meant the end of all they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dare ? He thought back over the forty-three years of his life , a comfortable life , most of it spent in easy circumstances , not an unduly challenging life as he rose through law school to political prominence , then down the other side of the curve into obscurity that had proved to be short-lived . He had never known real danger in his life . He had never known the sort of ultimate disappointments that came to so many others . There had been bad moments , of course : Eva 's death , the shattering of his political career . But generally the course of his life had been serene . There had been some enemies , political ones , who had worked what he liked to think of as his downfall ; but even that had been a gentle kind of strife , a chess game rather than a pitched war . This was different . This was life or death . He was placing his existence itself on the line  --  and for what ? For a cause . He had subscribed to causes before  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the elimination of poverty , the undoing of injustice . He had yielded his political supremacy for the sake of defending a cause , the quixotic one of governmental reform . But he had never known a cause for which he might be willing to risk death ; that sort of existential ultimatum had  | never offered itself to him . Now he faced such a risk , and he wondered if he had the courage to submit to its demands . Harker sat quietly thinking for perhaps half an hour . Then he called his wife and told her , in a calm , level voice , exactly what he was going to do . She was silent a moment . Then she said only , " Jim , why do you feel you have to do this thing ? " He wondered how he could explain . How he could show her that a moment sometimes comes when you stand between life and death , and all the choices are your own , and you find you must choose the option of maximum risk if you want to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think it 's the only way , Lois . It 'll show the world that this process can be trusted . " " Would it really prove anything ? " " I think it would . " " And there 's nobody else who could do it ? " " How could I ask anyone else , Lois ? " " But the risk , Jim , the risk is so awful . . . " One chance out of six I 'll come out of it an idiot , he thought bleakly . Yes . The awful risk . He said , " I would n't do it if I thought it were really risky , Lois . The whole point is that it is n't risky . You think I want to throw my life away ? You think I 'm aching to be a god-damned martyr ? " " Sometimes I think you do , Jim , " she said in a very quiet voice . He chuckled harshly . " Well , maybe . But I know what I 'm doing . The risks are minimal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get to everyone down deep . It 'll hammer home the safety of reanimation in a way that no amount of talking could ever do . " After a long pause she said , " You really mean this ? " " I do . " " When would you do it ? " " I do n't know . I 'd have to discuss it with the others here first . And we 'd need to plan a proper publicity campaign .  | Unless the whole world finds out about it , there 's no sense bothering to do it . " Lois said , " Do you have that much faith in those men ? " " Yes . How can we expect anyone else to trust what we 've got here , if we do n't trust ourselves ? " " All right , " she said , and he detected the resignation in her voice . " I guess I ought to fight and cry and tell you not to do it , but I know you too well , Jim . I think it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead , if you think you have to do this thing . I guess I might as well give my permission , because I know you 'll go ahead and do it anyway . " " Thanks , " he said . He smiled , but he knew the smile was a feeble one , and he was thankful that there was no screen on the phone he was using . He did not want her to see his face now , for he knew his face was that of a frightened man . Forty-three years of life converging toward one moment of decision in a bare little room on a rainsoaked New Jersey hillside . And he was coming to terms with the strangest motive for suicide in the history of the human race . " Do n't worry , " he said . " Everything 's going to be okay . " He broke the contact . It was still raining . He slung a waterproof over his shoulders and dashed across the clearing to Mart Raymond 's office . The sky was dark , gray , ominous . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceeding mechanically , with the air of a man marking time . They were all marking time , waiting for the decision from Congress . " Something wrong ? " Raymond asked . " I need to know something . " " Go ahead . " " How close are you to ironing out the business of loss of mind ? " " I told you before . A month 's more work , maybe . A little less , if everything goes well . Or it could be six months . We do n't know what obstacles we 're likely to hit as we proceed . "  | " But you 're sure that ultimately you 'll solve it ? " " Yes . " Nodding , Harker said quietly , " Okay . Look here , Mart : I 'm going to pull a Mitchison . " " Huh ? " " I mean , I 'm going to jump the gun and announce that you 've already straightened things out , and that from now on reanimation will work every time , provided no vital organs have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " What 's the point of doing that ? It is n't so . " " It will be so , sooner or later . Sooner , I hope . That part 's up to you . But I have an idea for a wild sort of publicity stunt , a grandstand play that should clinch the idea that reanimation is safe . Or else finish us altogether . " " What the dickens are you talking about , Jim ? " Harker walked to the window and stared out . After a moment he turned sharply and said , " Very simple . We 're going to give a public demonstration of reanimation sometime in the next few days . In order to prove the absolute safety of the process , I 'm going to allow you to terminate my life processes and then to bring me back to life . " " Are you crazy ? " " No , just desperate . It 's not quite the same thing . " " But suppose it does n't work , Jim ? " " The odds are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how Thurman looked ? " " I do , " Harker said . " I 'll take my chances . If it works , I think we 're home free . If it does n't , then you wo n't be much worse off than you are now . And I 'll be able to quit worrying . " He turned again and stared out the window . The rain had stopped . The sun was out . He laughed ; it was almost too pat . A rainbow arched proudly across the low hills , a many-colored ribbon stretching to the horizon .
