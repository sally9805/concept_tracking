Reverse Discrimination As a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of the University of Washington , Marco De Funis Jr. , 22 , had naturally assumed that he would be accepted by the university 's law school . He was not , either last year or this year when he reapplied . Aspiring lawyer that he was , De Funis went to court . The main point at issue was that the admission of 30 minority-group students with lower grades and aptitude scores showed discrimination against him in violation of the Constitution 's equal protection clause . <P> De Funis did not really expect to win , but to his surprise-and the university's-Seattle Superior Court Judge Lloyd Shorett has just ordered his admission . The Supreme Court 's 1954 desegregation ruling , said Judge Shorett , held that " public education must be equally available to all regardless of race . " At the University of Washington , Shorett concluded , whites had been discriminated against because of special standards used for minority admissions . <P> The university has indeed gone out of its way to recruit and admit blacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reputation as a leader in redressing minority imbalance in the student population . Though Judge Shorett specified that his ruling applied only to De Funis , the university is concerned about the impact of the decision and will appeal to the state supreme court . The argument will likely be that traditional tests reflect middle-class white values and so entitle the university to use special means of evaluating minority applicants . Moreover , says Law Dean Richard Roddis : " We are trying to bring people from traditionally excluded groups into the mainstream of legal activities as one way to overcome 200 years of discrimination .
