txt They drift slowly into the church basement , but they are all there by one o'clock , seven men in well-worn but neat suits and shirts and ties , eight women in cheerful dresses and an occasional burst of rouge . The men and women ? all over 60 ? sit patiently , chatting a little over the striped tablecloths about the new minister , then lapsing into polite silence as a Red Cross volunteer makes a first aid speech . Then what they have all been waiting for arrives : Two large tan sacks stacked with meals on trays : They are twice the size of airline trays , full of seafood loaf , mashed potatoes , broccoli , a relish grouping of carrots , celery , and olives , bread and butter , coffee , milk , orange juice , and mixed fruit . These trays are part of the 212,000 hot meals for the elderly being dished up five days a week under " Title VII " of the Older Americans Act .

Charles H. Percy ( R ) of Illinois , and Edward M. Kennedy ( D ) of Massachusetts . Both bills call for identical funding : $150 million the first year ( about 319,277 daily meals ) , $200 million for the second year ( 425,702 meals ) , and $250 million for the third year ( 532,128 meals ) . There is apparently no opposition to the bills in their present form Under the provisions of Title VII the meals are to be hot , nutritious , served five days a week , and contain at least one-third of the normal adult daily food requirement . The provisions also stipulate that older Americans are to be employed as much as possible in the program . More than hot lunches " The impact of inflation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meal program a virtual necessity for vast numbers of elderly Americans , " Senator Kennedy noted in introducing the bill . It is estimated that there are nearly four million older Americans who need these nutritionally balanced meals , often because their.incomes are near the poverty level " It 's called a hot lunch program , but it 's not , " says Mrs. San Juan Barnes , director of the Senior Neighbors and Companions Clubs of the Washington Urban League , which runs some of the programs here . " It 's a leisure program for senior citizens living alone , not involved , to bring them out of that one room into the mainstream of life . . . . " The program is designed to include " auxiliary services , " such as recreational , educational , and counseling programs , and to provide them in a group or social setting . To fight loneliness " As great as the nutritional need is the need to overcome loneliness . Loneliness can be a serious illness , " says an aide to Senator Pepper , underlining the importance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Often they 're living on such little income that there 's no money for a bus or a daily newspaper , " said the aide . Most of the sites for the nutrition program are chosen for their neigh-borhood accessibility : schools , churches , senior citizens ' groups . Some of the money in the program does go for " meals on wheels " ? hot meals to elderly shut-Ins , like the 91-year-old Washington woman who has not been out of her walk-up for two years . But the emphasis of the program is on " congregate " feeding with its social benefits , so that no more than 10 percent of the money goes to mealson-wheels , with the exception of far-flung rural areas where that ratio is not practical . Several marriages resulted There are indications that in some areas the social aspect of the program is particularly Successful : Mrs. Barnes estimated that 13 marriages resulted in a group of 400 people taking part in the nutrition program via the Washington Urban League . Senator Pepper 's aide notes that the program offers information on consumer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and social security questions , as well as movies and socializing But she adds it is all on a voluntary basis for the citizens who participate . Instances like the one cited earlier , in which a mandatory lecture prefaced a meal , are isolated and not typical or intended as part of the program , she added The nutrition for the elderly program is still in its infancy ( it did not get rolling till last fall ) . But there are a few early signs of popularity . In congressman Pepper 's Dade County in Florida word has gotten out at senior citizen clubs , and an aide says , " We 're having to turn people away every day " The program calls for allotment of the present $100 million state-by-state on the basis of each state 's 60-plus population , with the federal government underwriting the cost on a 90 ' 10 matching formula with the states .
