txt By a roll-call vote of 228 to 150 , the House of Representatives refused today to consider a controversial bill to permit increased logging in the national forests . The almost certain effect was to kill the bill for this session . The bill has been vigorously promoted by the timber industry as necessary to fulfill lumber requirements for the goal of 26 million homes set in the 1968 Housing and Urban Development Act . Just as vigorously it had been fought by virtually all national conservation organizations , which insisted its practical effect would be to subordinate other multiple uses of  --   --  // the forests ? watershed pro.tection , fish and wildlife protection , grazing and recreation to timbering . This , they arsrued , would result in the " rape " of a national resource . For the timber industry , the House Agriculture Committee , which overwhemingly approved the bill , and the Nixon Administration , which called for its passage , the defeat today came in an unusual , and somewhat humiliating , way . The House did not vote down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a resolution , technically called a " rule , " that would have brought the bill to the floor for two hours of debate and possible amendment before a final vote . This is an expedient rarely used to kill a bill . The bill now remains on the calendar , and it would be technically possible to bring it to the floor by unanimous consent , or by suspension of the rules , which requires a twothirds vote . But the size of the vote today in refusing even to consider the bill made this highly unlikely . The bill directs the Secretary of Agriculture " to develop into optimum timber productivity as soon as possible " the 97 million acres of commercial timber land in the 183 million acres of the national forests . Sixty-five per cent of the proceeds from timber sales would have been deposited into a " high timber yield fund " from which Congress would have appropriated money for reforestation , thinning , and fertilization to compensate , under the principle of " sustamed yield , " for the cutting . The conservation principle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Service in a 1960 law . In its original form , as proposed by the timber industry , the bill made no mention of multiple use . This omission was rectified in committee at the urging of the Forest Service and conservation groups . Nevertheless , the protection afforded seemed imprecise to the conservation groups and also to many members of Congress who were undoubtedly influenced by the growing climate of public concern about the environment and conservation of natural resources . Opposition to the bill also probably swelled when Representative W. R. Poage , Democrat of Texas , who is chairman of the Agriculture Committee , refused to support it on the ground that it did not sufficiently protect multiple use . Furthermore , members were aware that , despite White House support of the bill , the Forest Service itself was of two minds . On the one hand , the agency liked the idea of having at its disposal the proceeds of sales rather than relying on appropriations from general revenues . For example , it was estimated that under the bill it would receive $229-million from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , as compared to $85-million appropriated for reforestation and forest management this year . The Forest Service would welcome the extra money because it is already 5 million acres behind in reforestation of cut-over lands . On the other hand , the service was quite aware that the President might not request and the Congress might not appropriate all the money annually deposited in the fund . And under the bill the unused funds would be transferred to the Treasury if not used within two years . Because of the bill 's injunction to develop " optimum " productivity , the forest service realized it would be under intense industry pressure to allow increased cutting even if it did not receive all the money in the fund for reforestation . Representative B. F. Sisk , Democrat of California . told the House today that when tie cleared up " misunderstandings " about the bill in meetings with members of conservation groups , many of them changed their minds about it . Thereupon Representatives John D. Dingell , Democrat of Michigan , and John P , Saylor , Republican of Pennsylvania @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue with him .
