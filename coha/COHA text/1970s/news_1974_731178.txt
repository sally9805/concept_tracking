txt The Senate Watergate committee postponed indefinitely today the hearings on contributions to the 1972 Nixon campaign that were to have been held during the next twoweeks . Senator Sam J. Ervin Jr . of North Carolina , the committee chairman , said in a brief statement that the delay had been agreed upon " in order to make sure that no prejudice be done to the Mitchel/ and Stans trial " scheduled to begin Feb. 19 in United States District Court in New York City after several postponements . Former Attorney General John N. Mitchell and former Secretary of Commerce Maurice H. Stans will be tried for obstruction of justice and perjury . Since the life of the Ervin committee is scheduled to expire on Feb. 28 , today 's move raised the . question as to whether the hearings on campaign contributions by Howard R. Hughes and the milk industry would ever take place . Las Vegas Case The hearings next week were to have focused on allegations that Mr. Mitchell had permitted Mr. Hughes to buy a hotel and casino in Las Vegas , Nev. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a $100,000 cash contribution to Charles G. Rebozo , a close friend of President Nixon , Mr. Mitchell would also have been involved in the Watergate committee 's milk hearings . He has been charged with having dropped criminal proceedings against milk producers and of bringing a civil antitrust action instead after the industry gave a large contribution to the Nixon Presidential campaign . Yesterday , the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York , Paul J. Curran , called Senator Ervin , committee sources said , to inform him that the trial of the two former Nixon Cabinet officers would open in about three weeks and that it might be prejudiced by televised hearings in which unproved charges against Mr. Mitchell were made . After considering the problem overnight , Senator Ervin decided that the hearings should be postponed and telephoned five of the six other committee members , all of whom agreed . He was unable to reach Senator Edward J. Gurney , Republican of Florida . Mr. Curran reportedly assured Senator Ervin that he would not object to having the hearings rescheduled after a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jury had been sequestered to seal its members off from all relevant information except admissible evidence . Mr. Curran , who was reached by telephone at his home in suburban New York , said today that he would have no comment on the committee 's decision . The question of the potential impact of the hearings on the Mitchell-Stans trial had been raised in the Ervin committee before Mr. Curran 's request . Senator Lowell P. Weicker Jr. , Republican of Connecticut , strongly urged that the hearings be postponed for this reason when the committee met last Wednesday . Over united opposition by its Republican members , the committee voted , 4 to 3 , to hold the additional hearings on the Hughes-Rebozo contribution and the milk industry 's response to Government authority for higher prices . S.E.C. Investigation Mr. Mitchell and Mr. Stans are accused . of trying to obstruct an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission into the activities of Robert L. Vesco , the fugitive financier , in return for a secret $200,000 contribution by Mr. Vesco to the Nixon re-election campaign . The Watergate committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ F. Lenzner , an assistant chief counsel , protested that Senator Ervin had not informed anyone on the staff before he issued the postponement , but Rufus L. Edmiston , deputy chief counsel , reported that Mr. Ervin had called him before reaching the other members of the committee . The Senate is reportedly willing to extend the life of the Ervin committee beyond Feb. 28 , but probably only for a limited purpose . The committee expects to submit an interim report by that deadline but will seek an extension to pursue its litigation of White House records and to draft a final report . Whether the committee would ask for more time in which to hold the hearings postponed today and whether the Senate would grant such a request remained in doubt . The committee had planned to take testimony next week from Mr. Rebozo and a halfdozen other witnesses in an effort to establish whether the $100,000 later given to Mr. Rebozo by a Hughes aide had any connection with Mr. Mitchell 's decision in 1970 to authorize Mr. Hughes to buy the Dunes Hotel in Las Vegas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the purchase would concentrate too much : control of Las Vegas in one , man . Ultimately , Mr. Hughes decided not to buy the property .
