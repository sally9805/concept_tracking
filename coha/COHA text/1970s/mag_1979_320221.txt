Ending an expense account binge <P> When Roy Jenkins was Britain 's Chancellor of the Exchequer a decade ago , he boasted about his record of bringing " public expenditure under very sharp control . " He has been less successful in his tenure as president of the European Commission , a job he has held for the past 2 years . During his stewardship in the European Community 's top administrative post , a recent audit has revealed , many of the E.C . ' s 13 commissioners went on an expense account binge that was anything but controlled . <P> The 50-page audit , which was prepared by the European Court of Auditors and promptly leaked to the West German weekly Stern , disclosed that the commissioners , who administer the E.C. , had run up expenses that cost taxpayers from the nine Common Market nations a total of $1.4 million last year . In addition the commissioners were paid $2.1 million in salaries and allowances . The auditors turned up such items as Jenkins ' $3,842 bill for liquor consumed in his Brussels office , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and West German Commissioner Wilhelm Haferkamp 's $39,976 entertainment claim . When the auditors asked Haferkamp for guest lists of his lavish lunches at such Brussels luxury restaurants as the Ecailler du Palais Royal , he withdrew 23 of the bills , explaining that he could not remember whom he had invited . <P> It was Haferkamp , in fact , whose expense account artistry had provoked the European Parliament into ordering the audit earlier this year . Members of Parliament had been dismayed by reports that he had given a $14,000 cocktail party in Caracas and run up a $2,000 bill for three nights spent in New York City 's Pierre hotel . Last year , he took a woman friend on a trip to Peking as an official interpreter at E.C . expense and over Budget Commissioner Christopher Tugendhat 's objections . Though the woman was multilingual , she happened to speak not a word of Chinese . <P> The commissioners ' favorite means of transport were " air taxis , " or executive jets , costing more than $600,000 last year . Italy 's Lorenzo Natali made so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 104 days of the year in the Italian capital rather than in the commission 's Brussels headquarters . <P> Though the commissioners each receive from $20,000 to $33,000 a year for " representational " entertainment , depending on their individual ranks , in addition to their salaries of $122,000 to $145,000 , they exceeded their allowances by 24% , according to the audit . Stung by the charge , Jenkins issued a denial , arguing that the auditors were wrong in calling the 24% an " overrun . " The total amount spent , $376,000 , he said , was still less than the $381,300 he claimed the European Parliament had allocated for entertainment by the commissioners . But Jenkins promised to publish quickly the commission 's response to the audit as well as " a review of all existing practices and procedures . "
