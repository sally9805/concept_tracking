A dispute over privacy rights <P> Although Coors beer is sold almost exclusively in 14 Western states , it is the nation 's fifth bestselling beer and has become something of a status symbol in the East . Presidents Eisenhower and Ford used to bring cases of Coors back to Washington aboard Air Force jets after transcontinental trips . Actor Paul Newman always drank Coors on movie sets when it was available . <P> But as a huge Coors advertising balloon floated aloft in the company 's home state of Colorado last month , football fans booed in Denver 's Mile High Stadium . Reason : for nearly nine months the Adolph Coors Co. brewery , the world 's largest , has been the target of an unusual strike and boycott that are supported by a formidable , if somewhat incongruous alliance of activists that includes women 's groups , Chicanos , homosexuals and civil libertarians . The issue is not wages but the right of privacy . In fact , the average salary at the company , which has been controlled for three generations by the wealthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $19,500 for a 42-hour week . <P> Coors workers began the strike in April , when the company , which has been a union shop for 42 years , sought to limit seniority rights and diminish the authority of Local 366 of the brewery workers union over its 1,472 members . But the union quickly turned the dispute into an ideological confrontation with Chairman William Coors , 61 , and his brother Joseph , 60 , a well-known backer of the John Birch Society and other right-wing causes . The union 's allies are particularly upset by the firm 's practice of using lie-detector tests to probe into the lives of job applicants , and claim that Coors discriminates against minorities . <P> In a series of affidavits collected by the union , striking employees charged that lie-detector tests used by the company to screen job applicants required them to answer such questions as : What are your sex preferences ? How often do you change your underwear ? Have you ever done anything with your wife that could be considered immoral ? Are you a homosexual ? Are you a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of privacy . Says Union Business Manager David Sickler : " When you get through being grilled on that lie detector , you feel dirty . " <P> Coors executives say they did not know such questions were on the tests , which were prepared by outside polygraph companies and used before 1975 . Since then , they say , Coors has not permitted any questions concerning sex in its polygraph exams . But the union now wants Coors to stop using the tests , which the firm refuses to do . William Coors argues that the tests help reveal " whether the applicant may be hiding some health problem " and ensure that " the applicant does not want the job for some subversive reason such as sabotaging our operation . " There is some basis for the company 's concern : last August a tipster directed police to a pipe bomb at a Coors recycling plant in a Denver suburb .
