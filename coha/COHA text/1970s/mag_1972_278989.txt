It was an ordinary Chicago mailbox , the kind mailmen use for stashing their extra loads while making rounds . But what were those shuffling and humming sounds coming from within ? Curious or startled passers-by probably never found out , but they were made by Mailman John Prine , scrunched up inside the empty box to escape the icy wind , eating his lunch and composing his mournful songs . <P> That was two years ago . Since then , Prine , now 26 , has quit the post office , launched into a career as a songwriter and singer , and emerged from his box , so to speak , as one of the nation 's most striking new folk talents . But he is still singing the blue-collar blues . His leisurely , deceptively genial songs deal with the disillusioned fringe of Middle America , hauntingly evoking the world of fluorescent-lit truck stops , overladen knickknack shelves , gravel-dusty Army posts and lost loves . In a plangent baritone that makes him sound like a young Johnny Cash , he squeezes poetry out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lydia , one of the tracks on Prine 's recent Atlantic LP , Donald is a lonely Army private living in a " warehouse of strangers with 60-watt lights , " and Lydia is a small-eyed fat girl reading True Romance magazines up in her room and feeling " just like Sunday or Saturday afternoon . " When they make love to each other it is " from ten miles away . " In Hello In There , Prine sings of an elderly couple who live together silently in the city . She stares through the back screen door , while he ponders calling up a friend : <P> We worked together at the factory But what could I say when he asks , <P> " What 's new ? " <P> Nothing , what 's with you ? <P> Nothing much to do . <P> Prine 's balladeering also includes social comment , as in Sam Stone , a song about a veteran returning from " the conflict overseas with a Purple Heart and a monkey on his back . " The chorus is a quasi lullaby from a child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's arm where all the money goes . . . " Another song tells of a man killed in a car accident because he had covered his windshield with flag decals : " Your flag decal wo n't get you into heaven anymore/They 're already overcrowded from your dirty little war . " <P> <P> One of Prine 's most yearning songs is Paradise , which is not about heaven but a place named Paradise , Ky . " Until I was 15 I did n't know that the word paradise meant anything other than the town in Kentucky where all my relatives came from , " explains Prine . The relatives migrated to the Chicago area where John was born , raised ( with summers back in Kentucky ) and given a high school education of sorts . " But we never took much to the city , " says Prine , whose twangy accent , parted-in-the-middle haircut and beltless blue jeans mark him as a Chicago hillbilly . After high school there was the post office , the Army , marriage and the post office again . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind until I could compress it all together into one song .
