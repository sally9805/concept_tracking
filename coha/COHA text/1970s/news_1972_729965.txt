txt The Administration unveiled today its ideas concerning a value-added tax to a crosssection of government officials from all over the country and ran into criticism from virtually every point of the political and geographical compass . Administration officials defended the tax  --  while emphasizing that they were not committed to it ? mainly by emphasizing their plans to make sure that it does not hit the poor harder than those with more money , which is a common complaint against the tax . A value-added tax is paid at every step of the manufacturing and distribution process on all products and nearly all services . Elliot L. Richardson , the Secretary of Health , Education and Welfare , said that the Administration 's version of the tax " should eliminate from consideration " the argument that the value-added tax is " regressive " ? that is , a tax that hits the poor harder . The same theme was repeated by President Nixon at a news conference . He said he hoped to find another source of revenue to " replace " the property tax and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposals " under consideration Question 12 , Page 16 . But Mr. Nixon also said that he regarded the value-added tax as a regressive tax and that . " we are not going to replace one regressive tax with another regressive tax . " Accordingly , he said , the Administration was seeking some formula that would " remove " the regressive features of the tax , adding that he did not know " whether such a formula can be found . " This rather cautious view of the prospects for the value-added tax seemed to contrast with Mr. Richardson 's suggestion that the regressive features of the tax could be overcome . Mr. Nixon said that he would not ask for a tax increase this year . He said that even if he submitted new tax legislation this year it would be impossible to get it approved by Congress . The critics of the value-added tax today ranged from a liberal Democratic member of the House Ways and Means Committee , Representative Al Ullman of Oregon , to a conservative Republican Governor , Robert D. Ray of Iowa . Governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local governments to stop using the property tax to support public schools as a condition of receiving Federal aid . He said that this feature " would ' be disastrous for the State of Iowa . " He said that elimination of local taxes on property would leave his state $150-million short of the money it needs to finance education ? even with the new Federal aid added ? ? and would force the state either to add 2 per cent to its sales tax or to double its income tax . Mr. Ullman objected , among other things , to the idea that the value-added tax , which is a type of national sales tax , would be ' ' hidden , " rather than separately stated to the customer as sales taxes generally are . Another member of Congress , L. H. Fountain of North Carolina , a conservative Democrat , complained that no showing had been made that a new Federal tax was needed to help the states finance their schools . He noted that legislation was pending in Congress to turn over the costs of welfare to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the states through what is known as revenue-sharing . At the same time , he said , the birth rate is falling and school enrollments are stabilizing . Therefore , he said , " the first question we must answer is whether or not there is a compelling need " for a new Federal tax . The discussion of the valueadded tax and the property tax took place at a meeting of the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations , an organization made up of 26 representatives of the executive and legislative branches of the Federal and state and local governments , plus several private citizens . The commission has been asked by President Nixon to study a value-added tax and the problem of financing public schools more equitably . The Administrations valueadded tax plan would raise about $12-billion or $13 ? billion . That represents about one-third of local government outlays for operating expenses for public education . About $11-billion is raised now by local property taxes on residential property and $10-billion more by taxes on commercial and industrial property , including farms . Under the tentative plan , loIcal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but states could impose a property tax on nonresidential property . Thus the amount of money to be raised from the value-added tax would be slightly more than the amount lost by termination of local property taxes , if the states in fact imposed new property taxes , cf the present size , on nonresidential property . Today 's discussion of the details of the tentative plan brought out that the Administration was not thinking of refunding all the value-added taxes paid by poor persons , as had previously been indicated . Instead , the refund would be 1 per cent of adjusted gross income up to $12,000 of income , with a minimum of $15 a person . This would fall short of a full refund for some lowincome persons if the tax were set at 21/2 or 3 per cent , the figures under consideration . Above $12,000 of income , the refund would be phased out until , at $18,000 of income , there would be no refund . The phase-out provision would set the refund at $360 ' a person , minus 2 per cent of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
