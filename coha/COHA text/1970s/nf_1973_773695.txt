txt // Some of the entirely different forces that tend to reduce the special Gws during a recession have already been mentioned . If these forces suffice to reduce the gap between the successive special Gws and the successive actual Gs , this will reduce the rate at which the actual Gs decline through time . The actual Gs will cease to decline when the value of the current actual G is no longer below the value of the current special G. , ( bottom of the slump ) . This point should normally be represented in a time chart by a horizontal curve for G , namely the bottom of a U-shaped curve ? this follows from the definition of the bottom of a slump ? with the curve showing the successive values through time of the special Gws intersecting it downwards . The time chart of the special Gw curves will usually continue to fall after the bottom of the slump , until the rise of the G curve , representing actual incomes , begins to reverse the tendencies that had been previously reducing the specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstances that they no longer wished to save as high a fraction of their income as they had been saving before . It has to be admitted , as a theoretical possibility , that it could happen that the temporal chart of the successive special Gws became horizontal at the precise moment when the gap between it and the G curve was reduced to zero and the G curve consequently became horizontal . That would be a highly unlikely coincidence . If it happened , the economy could continue to bump along the bottom indefinitely . One would have fortuitously got an equilibrium analogous to that defined by the equation for normal warranted growth . But , happily , like the latter , it would be an unstable equilibrium . It would also be exposed to the centrifugal forces due to an overall average miscalculation as regards the uncertain future of substantial magnitude . If this erred on the side of pessimism , there would be a renewed bout of progressive recession . We should not have reached the bottom ' after all . This seems to have happened on occasions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it turned out that we had not ! ' If the miscalculation was on the side of optimism , then the scene would be set for progressive revival . It must be repeated that the eventuality of the temporal curve of successive special Gws becoming fiat at the precise // moment when it falls to the level of the G curve ( when that would be horizontal ) would be a highly improbable coincidence , and we do not need to worry much about it . The phenomenon of the business cycle is one aspect of the growth process . There is something rather peculiar about it , and it had been attracting the attention of economists for more than a century before I wrote anything . One would expect deviations from a steady growth rate ; but in the business cycle there does seem to be a cumulative process , continuing by its own momentum , both in the upward and downward phases . In my studies conducted many years ago I was not , as a theoretical economist , much impressed by the various alleged causes of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pigou . Then suddenly I saw light ? it was a very vivid experience occurring on a particular day ( I so well remember that day , even where I was standing at the moment in my rooms in Christ Church ) ? and published my theory in a book entitled The Trade Cycle : an Essay ( 1936 ) . That book was written with great speed , and was simply an attempt to put on paper for economists in the shortest possible compass , my central idea ? the interaction of J. M. Clark 's accelerator with Kahn 's multiplier ' . Keynes to the end refused to be interested in J. M. Clark 's accelerator . The Japanese translation of The Trade Cycle is still selling merrily in Japan . In that book there are to be found many of the ideas that have been developed in my subsequent writings on dynamic economics . But I did not , when writing it , have the advantage of having in my mind my fundamental growth equation , which also came to me in a flash on a particular day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of research and reflection I had evolved my growth equation . Not so . Reflection ' is , I suppose , relevant . In the course of my reflections ' I suddenly saw it in a split second . That was not in my Oxford study , but in John Betjeman 's cot-tage in Berkshire , which he lent me in July 1938 . Among the traditional theories of the business cycle , that of alternating psychological business optimism and pessimism alone , in my judgement , has validity . ( Harvest cycles ? was Jevons right in thinking them moon-induced ? ? play a dimin-ishing part in the business cycles of advanced countries . ) But what causes prevailing phases of optimism and pessimism ? One // may grant that they are infectious . But , if there is no basic cause for either , why does not one man 's optimism cancel the other 's pessimism , leaving no net source of infection ? But , if there is in fact an independent basic cause ( the instability principle ) leading to a cumulative upward or downward process , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it may cause the cumulative upward ( or downward ) movement to be greater than it would otherwise have been . The instability principle ' , although important in relation to the business cycle , is only a small part of the growth theory that I have endeavoured to expound , and , obviously , only a small part of the growth theory that will eventually be set forth as established doctrine in economic textbooks . And it is only a small part of what can be learned from a study of the fundamental growth equation . One final point remains to be made in relation to the instability principle . Neo-classical economists have , if I understand aright , sought to show that , if there is a deviation from equilibrium growth , there must be some price mechanism that restores the equilibrium . This is by analogy with the processes in the field of micro-statics , by which , if there is over-production or under-production of a particular commodity , the consequent fall or rise in its price restores its production to its equilibrium level . In fact the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ micro-statics . The price relied on by some to restore the warranted growth rate is the rate ( constellation of rates ) of interest . It is a fact that the rate of interest tends to rise in booms and to fall in slumps . In a boom ( upward departure from the warranted growth rate ) , either savings will be redundant to what persons and companies feel they want to make , or real capital in hand will be less than producers ( and merchants ) feel that they currently require , or ( more probably ) both . Excess saving will tend to cause savers to offer more capital disposal in the market than usual ; deficient real capital in hand will tend to cause those who use real capital to bid for more capital disposal than usual . A rise in the market rate of interest implies that the excess saving is less than the deficiency of real capital . We are discussing the matter in neo-classical terms . According to Keynesian theory the rise of interest that occurs in a boom is // due to something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raise the rate of the increase of the money supply by as much as the rise in the rate of increase of the put-through of goods in the boom multiplied by the rate of inflation that may be occurring . To return to the classical concept , it is held that the rise in the rate of interest will stimulate the offer of capital disposal and depress the demand for it , thereby bringing the two into equality . But this does not imply that the growth rate returns to its warranted level . On the contrary , it will stay above it . There is no return to the previous equilibrium . Savings will be more than they were before and so will orders for real capital . Thus we have something entirely different from the tendency to return to an equilibrium position as demonstrated in microstatics . At this point a word may be said about the influence of the rate of interest . It appears to me to be very doubtful whether a rise in it has any appreciable tendency to increase the savings of persons or companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an upward departure of actual growth from warranted growth we are dealing with a comparatively short period . Persons have their well thought-out saving plans ? their insurance premiums , etc . They do not modify them every few months in response to interest rate changes . Furthermore , it is by no means certain in what direction the modification would be , if there were one . As is well known , a rise in the rate of interest may cause them to save less than they otherwise would . Their demand for retirement pensions or money to leave to their children may be inelastic . If a person 's income goes up in a boom , he may think that he would like to add k pounds to his retirement pension . The higher the rate of interest the less money this will cost , so that the rise in the rate of interest , if it occurs , causes him to save less than he otherwise would . Companies are on both sides of the market as regards capital disposal . If the boom makes them short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save more ) than they otherwise would . It does not seem likely that many companies would actually reduce dividends during a boom in profit . But , while their own requirements may make them conservative in their distribution , it does not seem likely that a rise in the market rate of interest // would by itself cause them to distribute less than they would otherwise have done . Finally we come to the effect of a high rate of interest on their plans for adding to their real capital . It is to be remembered that for most ( almost all ) firms the capital market is an imperfect one . If the higher interest is associated with increased difficulty of borrowing from normal sources of supply of capital disposal to them , this may indeed limit their plans for real capital formation . Whether or not there is in these conditions an increased difficulty of borrowing from usual sources will depend largely on what the monetary authorities do about the money supply . Discussion of this would take us into Keynesian territory , which is verboten in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the equilibrium of the warranted growth path is not unstable appear to rely on the idea that high interest will cause a change in the mix in which capital and labour are employed in the processes of production ( and distribution ) in favour of the use of labour . This idea is unplausible in the highest degree . It is to be remembered that the rise of interest due to an upward deviation of the actual from the warranted rate of growth is a fairly short-period phenomenon ; when the actual rate returns to the warranted rate , the rate of interest will presumably return to where it was before . In assessing the costs of alternative methods of production , firms often have some standard rate of profit , which includes interest , that they add to the input costs . It is most unlikely that they will modify this standard rate in accordance with short term variations in the market rate of interest . Of course if the market rate of interest rises considerably and stays up for a substantial period , as it has done recently ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mark-up . But even when they do this , it is seldom likely to have any appreciable effect on their decision about which method of production among alternative methods with different capital-labour mixes is the most efficient . Interest is not a sufficiently important element in cost . It is true that there may be very large differences in the labour-capital mix as between small firms and large and as between different countries and different periods of time . These are due to differences of technological availabilities or to market // sizes , and not in most cases to differences in the rate of interest . In the late nineteenth century the U.S.A. developed progressively more capital-intensive methods of production than the U.K. although the rate of interest was consistently higher there than in the U.K. I am confident that the theory that the warranted ' equilibrium growth rate of laissez-faire capitalism , without management or interference , is unstable , stands firm ; and that it is the fundamental explanation of the business cycle . There is the further question of whether laissez-faire capitalism tends to bring the economy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Keynes , with which I agree , that this was not so . The actual facts of experience , showing rather lengthy spells of unemployment , also suggest that this is not so . But , even if it were so , that would not guarantee growth in accordance with potential . Producers will not scrap existing methods of production , in favour of methods yielding greater output per person , if they do not expect the lower price to stimulate demand sufficiently to absorb the extra output . So , even with full employment , the growth potential may not be achieved . 4 Capital Output Ratio The capital-output ratio is an expression increasingly used in economic literature , but not always unambiguously . The provision of a precise definition is not an altogether easy task . One may approach it by first considering the kindred concept of the capital-labour ratio . In this expression labour is taken to cover , not only the wageearning factor , but current inputs into the productive process of all kinds . We may approach this by considering the more general concept of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principal methods for measuring capital intensity , which we may call the Austrian and the Marxist respectively . The two methods should give the same ordering for the degrees of capital intensity , whether in the comparison of various products at a given point of time , of the methods of production of a given commodity at different points of time , or of alternative available methods of producing a given commodity at a given time . By the Austrian method there is no ratio ' . One measures capital intensity by taking the average interval of time between all the various inputs of productive resources and the outputs which they are designed to produce . The greater the time interval , the more capita intensive is the method of production said to be . If fixed capital is used , the inputs required to produce that capital must be included in the calculation of the average time interval ; that indeed is of the essence of this method . The time interval between the application of resources to the production of fixed capital and the eventuation of the product that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the interval between the labour that uses the fixed capital and the output . Thus if the amount of fixed capital used in method A for producing a given object is greater than that in method B , the time interval is likely to be longer . // There is the traditional distinction in political economy between the kind of input that produces one single particular object only and that which yields a flow of objects . Accordingly , to get an accurate assessment of the average time interval in the latter case , it is needful to be able to project correctly for how long the flow of outputs due to a given input will continue to come in . That difficulty arises with other methods of measurement also . Some have objected in principle to the time-interval concept on the ground that it involves an infinite regress . The machinery that extracts coal has had to be produced with steel and that steel had to be produced with the aid of coal , which in its turn required machinery ? or , perhaps , a primitive axe ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This objection is not really valid . The proportion of current output attributable to inputs in the backward stretch of time is smaller the further one goes back . An infinite diminishing series can be summed . It must be admitted , however , that the time-interval concept is not very handy for application . Its value is rather that it provides an intellectual clarification . Interest is the reward for waiting . The longer the average waiting between inputs and the output of a given object , the greater will the interest element be in the value of that object . In what I have called the Marxist approach , we measure capital intensity by a ratio , namely the ratio of embodied labour to living labour . We must , of course , use labour ' in its broadest sense , namely to include inputs of all kinds . Any useful object , which has been rendered into the shape that it now has by previous inputs , embodies ' labour . These objects include not only fixed capital , houses , etc. , but also goods in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until they are finally destroyed by use ' . It has been customary to exclude movable objects that have reached the hands of their final buyers ? household furniture , trousers in the cupboard , etc. ? even although they still have a useful length of life before them . This exclusion may become a little precarious , now that the practice of buying objets d'art , not for their enjoyment , but as a hedge against inflation , has become so widespread . In all cases capital must be given its written-down value during the production process . Thus , if an object has already // done half the useful work that it is expected to do , then it must be reckoned as embodying half the labour that was used to create it . Accordingly this method of measuring capital intensity also requires insight into the future . Doubtless in accountancy practice arbitrary , and , usually , conservative , rates of depreciation are used . But this has no bearing on our present analysis . In order to give a figure for the amount of living ' labour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A year is generally used . Thus the amount of living labour is said to be all the inputs during the course of the year . These include those devoted to creating new capital or replacing worn out capital . As the inputs are of different kinds , their relative values have to be established , in order to get the amount of living input required for a particular product or for the national income . As regards labour embodied before the period under consideration , the various kinds of inputs may have had relative values at the time when they were embodied different from their present ones . Strictly speaking , in assessing the total value of embodied labour , the old inputs should be revalued in accordance with their present values . A formidable task ! Happily in C , to which I shall in due course return , we are concerned only with the increment of embodied labour during the period , so that no problem of revaluation arises . The concept of the total value of the capital in the country , often designated by K , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my fundamental growth theory . But in the work of some writers it occupies a prominent place . It is to be stressed that the capital-labour ratio is a useful weapon for comparing alternative methods of producing a given object , for comparing methods of producing different objects or for comparing the changes through time of methods of producing a given object . It is on the whole an unserviceable tool in relation to national income as a whole , but it can be employed in a very rough sort of way for comparing different countries . A word must be said here about land and mineral deposits . In traditional economics these were kept separate from capital ' , advisedly in my opinion . There was also the classic distinction between the value of land as determined by the natural and indestructible powers of the soil ' and that due to past improveCAPITAL // ments . The distinction is absolutely unmanageable . And that gives a further reason for keeping K right out of the fundamental growth equations . But there is no insuperable difficulty in assessing the amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the current period , as required for the assessment of C. On the other hand , it is proper to include the current contribution of land towards current output among living inputs . This may be paradoxical . But , as already explained , inputs of all kinds in the current periods should be counted as living ' inputs . The different kinds of living input , from unskilled to managerial labour , etc. , have to be valued relatively to each other . The value of the current input that is contributed by rented land may be gauged by the rent . If the land is cultivatorowned , its rentable value may be assessed by analogy . There should be a similar assessment when rents are running below the true economic values owing to long leases . Thus we may define the capital/labour ratio as Value of embodied inputs , written down Value of living inputs ( including use of land ) p.a . We may go over to the capital-output ratio . In the case of the capital-labour ratio we saw that it was needful to establish the relative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and embodied , and in the case of embodied inputs to revalue them if the relative values of these kinds of inputs had changed since they were embodied . With the capital output ratio we come to a fresh set of problems . The numerator and denominator of the capital labour ratio are aggregates of the same kinds of things ? inputs . But the denominator of the capital-output ratio consists of things of an altogether different kind from the inputs , viz. goods and services . We have accordingly to find a common yardstick for measuring the relative values of inputs and outputs . This brings us to the age-old problem of the best measure of value ? a labour measure or a goods measure . The austere school of David Ricardo , and , in our times , Sir Ralph Hawtrey , have desiderated a labour measure . This means that the prices of goods ( and services ) fall in the economy as a whole in precise // proportion to the average increase in the quantity of output per unit of input , i.e. to the average increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rates of rewards to the various kinds of inputs would remain constant through time . We need not dwell on the still more austere desideratum of Professor F. A. von Hayek , that prices should move down in proportion , not to the increase of output per head , but to the increase of total output in a given economy , so that with increasing population the fall of prices would be proportionately greater than it would otherwise have been . This would mean a continuing fall through time of the money rewards to factors of production . On the more moderate Ricardo ? Hawtrey plan , factors with stable money rewards would experience a rising level of real rewards through falling prices . In these days of endemic inflation , we shall feel happy if we can achieve the target of stable prices , viz. a goods measure of value . Money rewards to factors then rise in proportion to the average overall increase of productivity . Let us proceed in terms of a regime of stable prices . It is to be noted that the real value of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the output of goods and services . In a regime of stable prices the money value of rewards rises in this proportion . Profit has not so far been discussed . It presents difficulties . It clearly enters into the value of output . Is there an input corresponding to it ? Profit clearly does not accrue in return for no service . On the other hand it , or at least part of it , is a residue . This makes it difficult to value the service , for which an unknown reward will ultimately be paid , as and when it is rendered . One way of dealing with the matter might be to regard the service for which profit is paid ? dare we call it enterprise ? ? as a living input rendered simultaneously with the accrual of the output . Much depends on the area for which we are seeking to establish the capital-output ratio . We have already seen that the concept of the capital labour ratio is not very helpful , if applied to the economy as a whole , owing to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a whole . But if we are considering a particular firm or industry , which purchases embodied labour from another firm or industry , the value of what is purchased will include profit . Thus some part of CAPITAL OUTPUT RATIO 5 ' all profit will figure in the value of embodied inputs and living inputs of the service for which profit is paid may be reckoned as occurring simultaneously with these purchases . There may be some portion of aggregate profit that can not be handled in this way or sensibly be included in the capital/labour ratio . But all profit goes into the value of output . Let us call this portion residual profit ' . We may define the capital-output ratio as Value of embodied inputs , written down Value of living inputs + residual ' profit ? value of replacements Replacements have to be subtracted in the denominator , since living inputs devoted to them merely serve to keep the value of embodied inputs , written down , intact . They offset the inputs currently being sweated out of embodied inputs through wear and tear and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of current output . The two ratios may be expected to move together , unless residual profit is advancing at a rate different from that of the other terms . It is to be noted that the capital-labour ratio is entirely different from the much used concept of value of capital per head , a hybrid notion . In an economy in which output per head was rising one would expect the capital per head ratio to rise also . Professor Sidney Weintraub , however , has presented a surprising statistical computation that seems to show that in the U.S.A. , a highly capitalised country , capital per head had a downward trend for more than a decade in the thirties and forties . ' This means that technical progress in the U.S.A. in this period must have been highly capital-saving . Since , with progress , the value per unit of embodied inputs rises , inventions would have to be substantially capital-saving merely to prevent the value of capital per head from rising . In fact a reasonable explanation can be given , which is probably correct . It may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital was in this period more rapid than that in the methods of using it or of providing services . This 1 S. Weintraub , Some Aspects of Wage Theory and Policy ( Chilton Co. , 1963 ) p. io6. // would reduce the amount of embodied labour relatively to that of living labour , and , if it reduced it enough , it could reduce the value per head of the working population of all embodied labour despite the continuing rise in value of each unit of embodied labour . Questions of age distribution also come in . Technical progress may be labour-saving , neutral or capital saving . There is a problem about the best definition of netrality . In my Towards a Dynamic Economics ( 1948 ) I supplied one . I defined it as one which does not disturb what I have called in these pages the capital ? labour ratio and leaves the length of the production process unchanged . I wrote ... clearly in a case of this sort there is no question of a correct definition . One 's definition should involve a reasonable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a tool for the kind of approach to the dynamic problem which I am attempting , there is much to be said for my definition both on logical and econometrical grounds . . . A stream of inventions , which are neutral as defined , will , provided that the rate of interest is unchanged , leave the distribution of the total national product as between labour ( in the broadest sense ) and capital unchanged . The prevailing character of inventions through a period in which there is no cumulative change in the rate of interest , can be measured by comparing the growth in the value of capital with the growth of income . This can also be done in each industry separately and in each firm . Then follows a passage about amortisation which is dealt with elsewhere in these pages . I will continue quoting from my earlier work . In his Theory of Wages Mr Hicks supplied a somewhat different definition of a neutral invention ( pp. 121 ? 127 ) . He defined it as one which raises the marginal productivity of labour and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but there are a number of causes which make it unsuitable for my purpose . The special characters of my definition may be brought out by a comparison with his . i . The Hicks definition make the neutrality of an invention depend on various elasticities , namely elasticities of // substitution as between capital and labour in other industries and of the demand for other products using them in various proportions , throughout the whole economy . Thus the neutrality of the invention depends on circumstances quite unrelated to the intrinsic character of the invention itself . My definition determines the matter solely by reference to the invention itself , and is , on this account , a handier tool in a first approach to a great field of study , in which the utmost simplicity is desirable . 2 . Mr Hicks compares his definition with an earlier one given by Professor Pigou.l Pigou 's definition makes neutrality depend on what happens on the assumption that the quantities of capital and labour available to the economy are unaffected by the invention . Professor Pigou proceeds to consider , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the harmony between the interests of labour ' and society as a whole , what will result if the supply of the factors is altered in consequence ; but this analysis is not taken to modify the definition . Mr Hicks seems to leave the question what is to be assumed about the supply of the factors open . But whether he is taken to follow Professor Pigou in assuming absolutely inelastic supply or not , the position is equally unsatisfactory . To assume an absolutely inelastic supply in every case is somewhat unrealistic . To allow , on the other hand , that the actual elasticities of supply , whatever they may be from time to time , must be taken into account in determining whether an invention is neutral or not , again makes the definition of neutrality depend , not on the intrinsic nature of the invention , but on quite outside factors . Furthermore either assumption , and indeed this whole method of approach , is quite appropriate in relation to a once-over invention ( static analysis ) , but not to a stream of successive new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought it is proper to assume determinate supply schedules of the factors and to conceive of marginal productivities as governed by the intersection of supply and demand curves . A once-over invention leads to a once-over change of prices which determines and is determined by a once-over change in the supply of factors in the 1 Economics of Welfare ( 2nd ed. ) pp. 632-8. // ordinary way , the supply schedules being conceived to remain unchanged . When we have to consider a stream of new inventions confronting a growth of capital ( viz. positive saving continuing to accrue ) a different technique is required . We must remember that the equilibrating force may not be , as in the static analysis , a price ( or set of prices ) , but a certain rate of change of price . 3 . In selecting an assumption for the purpose of defining neutrality one has to choose between the assumption of a fixed supply of factors or that of an increasing one . The assumption of a constant supply schedule of the old fashioned kind is inappropriate , since that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no significance in dynamics ; to put it differently , one co-ordinate of the schedule is a price , and not , as is required in dynamics , a rate of change of price . To assume a constant supply of the factors through time is highly unrealistic in relation to any of the economies in which we are interested , and at the same time sets a much more complicated problem for the definition of neutrality . Thus it may be rejected on two excellent grounds . As I have chosen to approach the dynamic problem by asking what rate of increase of capital would be consistent with certain rates of increase in other parts of the system , it has seemed simplest to define a neutral stream of inventions as one which shall require a rate of increase of capital equal to the rate of increase of income engendered by it . If the stream of inventions requires capital to increase at a greater rate , then it is labour-saving or capital-requiring ; and conversely . The rate of interest is assumed to be constant , since that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest . 4 . The neutrality of an invention would be determined on my definition by reference to what happens to the capital coefficient , if the rate of interest is constant . In the language of statics this implies an infinitely elastic supply of capital at the existing rate of interest . My definition does not , of course , assume that the supply is infinitely elastic ; but if it is , then it will be possible to use it to classify all and sundry inventions as they occur . Those who follow Keynes in holding that , // save in conditions of Full Employment , the supply of capital is in fact infinitely elastic at a given rate of interest , should give my definition a particularly good mark for its econometric soundness . 5 . It does not appear possible to say whether Mr Hicks 's definition or mine would put more actual inventions into the labour-saving box . His depends partly on the outside circumstances , mine on the intrinsic character of the invention only . I can not find any consideration making it probable that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope , I may say in digression , already to be giving a dim conception ? and I only conceive dimly myself  --  of the kind of revolution that is required in economics . I want to see those keen tools of thought of Pigou and Hicks , which have been so finely used to perfect static theory , applied to the rough dynamics of Ricardo , changing it indeed out of recognition in the process , as modern marginal analysis has already long since changed the theories of price and cost of Adam Smith and Ricardo . This should involve a considerable re-writing of economics . It must not be taken to be implied that a neutral invention as defined is the most likely kind of invention . Nothing of this sort is presupposed in my definition , or for that matter in the definitions advanced by others . I might be permitted to observe in passing , however , that it is not my impression that in recent years inventions have been predominantly of a character tending to raise the capital coefficient as calculated at and determined by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that inventions have been predominantly laboursaving in the sense defined . With a stationary population , then , and a steady and neutral technological advance , the new capital required would be a constant fraction of income equal to the increase of income ( or output ) in any period , considered as a fraction of total income multiplied by the capital coefficient . The same period must be used in calculating the increase of output and in computing the capita coefficient . If a is the fraction of income required to be saved when population is increasing at a given rate X and technology is stationary and b the fraction of income required to be saved // when population is stationary and technological advance makes possible an increase of output at rate Y , then , when there is both a population increase of X and an increase of output per head of Y , the fraction of income required to be I saved will be a + b + ab . ab is likely to be a very small quantity and may be safely neglected . If the stream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average , this will be conjugated with a lower warranted growth than would obtain if they were neutral . If part of available savings are needed to finance more capitalintensive methods of production , there will not be so much left over to finance sheer expansion as such . May a given warranted growth rate be associated with unemployment , and even with rising unemployment ? It seems so . This question will have to be explored thoroughly , when we examine the interactions , in different circumstances , between the warranted and natural growth rates ( Chapter 7 ) . Of the latter the rate of increase in the population of working age is a leading determinant . The instability principle , as explained in the last chapter , relates only to the interactions between the warranted and actual growth rates . The idea of substantial positive unemployment , in addition to mere frictional unemployment , being present in a condition of equilibrium is , of course , consistent with Keynesian macrostatics . But according to dynamic theory the pool of unemployment is not likely to remain stagnant for long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ departure of the actual from the warranted growth rate . The economy will move towards the ceiling of full employment ; it may not get the whole way there for reasons set out in the last chapter . In many cases ? depending on the relation between the warranted and actual rates ? the condition of full employment , if achieved , may be highly unstable . This is not only required by dynamic theory , but also seems conformable with much experience in capitalist economies . This has nothing whatever to do with wages being inflexible downwards , a doctrine of old-fashioned micro-statics . Keynes was right in holding , in his macro-static theory , that a downward revision of wages would not , to any important degree , tend to reduce unemployment . i // There remains the question of what determines the relative values of the various living inputs . Here traditional microstatics stands in good stead . There are the market-place forces of supply and demand , which , if unimpeded , secure a Pareto optimum . The result of their interplay may be modified by monopolistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree of monopoly is growing or stationary . There is a third force , in my opinion important , namely historic tradition , which may reflect onto the present , caused by events occurring more than a century ago . There have in the long past been established certain rules , by which , if craftsman A was then deemed to deserve a 10 per cent higher wage than craftsman B , that differential has been maintained until the present . When the rate of pay of craftsman A goes up , that of craftsman B goes up in the same ratio , whatever the market forces are , or whatever is the monopolistic power of the unions looking after the craft A type of employee , compared with that of those looking after craft B. To the latter will accrue automatic increases of wages , as related to increases in craft A , whatever the market forces or monopoly positions favouring ( or disfavouring ) workers in craft B. C , relates to the incremental capital output ratio in the equilibrium of warranted growth . It is measured in terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post-mortem revaluations of capital assets . If there have been deviations from the equilibrium of warranted growth during the relevant past , this will affect the value of Cr in the manner described in the last chapter . 5 Interest The classical theory of interest is that it is the price that equates the supply of capital to the demand for it . For greater precision one should substitute for capital ' above the term capital disposal ' , retaining the word capital ' to describe physical objects in which inputs have been embodied with a view to future outputs , as already explained . Some writers have liked to refer also to human capital ' , regarding the work of teachers and trainers as inputs into those taught that will enable them over future time to produce more than they would have been able to do without the education and training in question . We have a regress here too . There is the labour of those who educated the educators , and so on backwards . This is a nice analogy , but of limited serviceableness . It has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limited amounts of capital disposal available should ensure that a proper proportion is devoted to education and technological training . But there is this difference , which makes the idea of interest inapplicable in this field : those responsible for inputs of this kind do not themselves usually receive back the values represented by the higher outputs of those educated . This may also apply in certain categories of physical objects , like public parks , etc . Not all education should be regarded as an input of capital disposal . There are those parts of education that teach the recipients to be better and wiser people , to have greater appreciation of the beauties of nature and of art , and to comport themselves in their social relations in ways conducive to peace and harmony ; here we are drifting away from the realm of economics proper into that of a wider sociology . On the demand side those who enter the market want capital disposal in order to be able to finance the embodiment of living inputs into productive capital , the outputs from which will accrue only at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are // prepared to pay a price for this . There is also a demand for capital disposal for investment in consumer capital . It takes various forms that may be given the generic name of consumer credit ( see also below ) . In this very general discussion of the nature of interest I shall leave aside for the time being the distinctions between the different kinds of borrowing ? shortterm , medium-term , long-term , etc. , and acquiring capital disposal in exchange for equities . Why is the supplier not content to receive his capital disposal back at a later date , being content with no more than a modest service charge for the transaction ? The supplier has a time preference . He is being asked to swap value in hand for value at some future date . He prefers to have value in hand now , and , if asked to sacrifice this in exchange for value in the future , he needs a substantial premium to be induced to do so . Interest is , as already stated , the reward for present abstinence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to be , but are not always , distinguished sharply . One aspect is what Pigou called lack of telescopic faculty ' . Persons often can not envisage the pleasure of having a certain amount of value in hand at some future date as clearly as they envisage the pleasure that they can get for an equal amount of value now . Allied to this is brute appetite . It is a question of the emotions . David Hume said that reason is , and ought to be , the servant of the passions ' . Whether the and ought to be ' is appropriate in this context we shall presently discuss . The other aspect , admirably set forth by Irving Fisher , is the diminishing utility of income . Ifoutput per caput in the economy is growing year by year , then persons , on the overall average , will expect to have higher incomes in future years . Swapping a given amount of value now for an equal amount at future dates is not a good bargain for those who expect to have a higher income at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utility of a pound of income will be lower . An excess of value returned , or returnable , to the supplier of capital disposal over the value that he supplies now is required in order to induce him , if he is rational , to make the swap . That excess is interest ' . Of course , there are some , like almost all university undergraduates , whom no rate of interest of any amount feasible in more or less developed countries could induce to save part of their 6o ECONOMIC DYNAMICS incomes for a future accrual . The average student , apart from the minority that inherit large money , assume that in , say , twenty years after graduation they will be getting a much larger income than they now have ; it would make no sense for them to cut down on their modest student expenditure in order to add something that will come to them in future years . Apart from business cycles of optimism and pessimism , most human beings are fairly optimistic about their own prospects . There is of course the exceptional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students who have confided in me that they would never possibly be able to earn money and would very much dislike doing so , if they could . I should suppose this refined type to be a little less rare in the old world than in America ; but I am not sure about that ? it would be difficult to make a statistical investigation since they are so many more with substantial independent means in the latter country . There are those in the opposite position , to whom the prospect of a decline of income after earning capacity drops becomes significant . These would save something , even if there were no rate of interest on capital disposal . If this class of persons could alone satisfy all demands for capital disposal then there would be no need for a positive rate of interest . But one has to take the pattern of the whole population . If the weight in the population of those who are still able to foresee a growth of income on balance during their remaining years is greater than that of those who foresee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a positive rate of interest for capital suppliers will be required by the diminishing utility of income principle . We must return to the question of consumer credit , now so widely prevalent . It is a question of spreading forward from the present the cost of more or less durable consumer goods that yield enjoyment over a period of time . Many consumers might not be able to afford the whole cost of such goods out of their current income , without digging too deeply into their consumption of perishable goods . It is natural that they should be willing to pay interest for the advantage of not having to pay a down sum for the durable consumer goods . This is independent of whether they expect their incomes to rise , remain stationary or fall during the period in question . Actually , rates of interest in the market for this particular use of capital disposal have often been // exorbitant . This is probably because this market is much less ancient than the markets for the capital disposal required for production and trade . In due course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the influence of competition ; but these things take time . Capital disposal is generated by the savings of persons , companies and governmental agencies . It may also come from depreciation funds not used for replacement , as when some particular line of production is terminated . Aggregate investment in an economy is equal to aggregate saving . Banks , as companies , can contribute to saving by not distributing to their shareholders the whole of their realised profit . But they do not add to aggregate saving by increasing their holdings of securities of various kinds or by their loans to clients . There has sometimes been confused thinking on this point . Banks may encourage investment by becoming more willing to lend to clients , who have been held back from making investments that they had been wanting to make by lack of available finance . It must always be remembered that the capital market is an imperfect one . The central bank normally governs changes towards greater ease or toughness in the willingness of the banks to lend by its own operations , and by the observance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To repeat , the banks do not directly generate additional saving by lending more . Their easier attitude to lending , however , may cause some investments to be made that would not otherwise have taken place . But saving must always be equal to investment . A paradox here . In a steady advance , the increase of total investment , including that financed by bank loans , will proceed concurrently with an equal increase in savings ; there is no problem . But suppose an upward inflection in bank lending . Instanter the extra investment financed by the banks will be fully offset by a depletion of stocks , so that there will be no net extra investment in the economy as a whole ; those newly employed on the extra investment will spend part of their incomes and this will deplete stocks . But in due course steps will be taken to increase the flow of consumer goods , to match , not only the requirements of those at work on the additional investment , but also the requirements of those producing the extra consumer goods . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circle of increased spending proceeds , until the savings of those newly employed , or working longer hours , and indeed the extra savings of their employers also , add up to the value of the extra investment , as encouraged by the banks , plus that of the extra stocks that may be needed in relation to the higher level of consumption . When the banks make money easier , they may not only lend more to clients , but also purchase bills and bonds . Both processes necessarily increase the money supply . Both processes involve a swap of assets between the banks and the non-bank public . The swap raises the ratio of money to non-money assets held by the non-bank public . This brings us straight onto Keynes 's theory of interest , a central feature of his whole system . The increase in the money supply held by the public will normally be greater than they require for circulating goods , given a constant velocity of circulation , while their stock of non-money assets will be reduced below its previous level . They did not ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so to speak , through the action of the banks . The non-bank public will seek to restore the ratio between money and non-monetary assets to , or towards , its old level by bidding for bonds , etc . While some individuals may achieve what they desire , the non-bank public as a whole can not do so , unless or until the banks start moving in the opposite direction and reduce the money supply . The quantity of money in the hands of the public has been increased and that of non-monetary assets has been reduced , and that is that . Meanwhile the attempts by the non-bank public to restore their non-bank assets to the desired level will send up the prices of these assets and thus bring down interest rates . That is the Keynesian theory of what determines the rate of interest . His liquidity preference ' concerns the proportion of their total assets that people want to hold in the form of cash and the proportion that they want to hold in the form of securities of different kinds . The banking system determines the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word want ' in want to hold ' is relative . How strong is their want ' ? They will want to hold more in the form of securities if their interest yield is high and less if their interest yield is low . The market rate of interest moves to the level that makes people want to // hold cash and other assets in proportions equal to those that actually exist . What then is the relation between the classical theory of interest and the Keynesian theory ? At the stage that the theory had reached in Keynes 's Treatise on Money , the relation is really quite simple . Classical theory specifies the determinants of the rate that is consistent with equilibrium , while his own theory specifies the determinants of the actual market rate from time to time . It is needful to recall that in the Treatise saving is not necessarily equal to investment . Keynes was well aware , as he himself stated , of the book-keeping identity of total saving to total investment , as needed , for instance , for national income accounts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his own equilibrium theory , by excluding from what is saved windfall ' profit ; if a company makes a windfall loss ( or subnormal profit ) the shortfall in its saving below what it would otherwise have been is subtracted from total national saving in assessing the amount of what we may call Keynesian saving . If in the economy as a whole there are net windfall profits or windfall losses ( subnormal profits ) , that is a symptom of disequilibrium . I quote Keynes . Following Wicksell , it will be convenient to call the rate of interest which would cause the second term of our second Fundamental Equation viz. Investment minus Saving divided by the output of consumer goods to be zero the natural-rate of interest , and the rate which actually prevails the market-rate of interest . Thus the natural rate of interest is the rate at which saving and the value of investment are exactly balanced , so that the price-level of output as a whole exactly corresponds to the money-rate of the efficiency earnings of the Factors of Production . Every departure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other hand , to set up a disturbance of the price-level by causing the second term of the second Fundamental Equation to depart from zero . ' In the General Theory Keynes departs further from the classical position , and also indulges in some unnecessary tilting at classical economics . This may have done some harm to the Treatise on Money , vol. r , pp. 154-5. // progress of economic theory , which should consist of a system of harmonious concepts . In the Treatise there is only one equilibrium position , namely when investment is equal to saving ( Treatise definition of these concepts ) . In the General Theory Keynes insists that there are many possible positions of equilibrium , with corresponding levels of unemployment . What the actual position of equilibrium at any time is depends on the determinants of aggregate effective demand . But the economy may also be , doubtless usually is , in disequilibrium . The natural ' rate of interest remains that consistent with equilibrium . But since there are as many possible equilibrium positions as there are levels of unemployment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest . He writes : In my Treatise on Money I defined what purported to be a unique rate of interest , which I called the natural rate of interest ? namely , the rate ofinterest which , in the terminology of my Treatise , preserved equality between the rate of saving ( as there defined ) and the rate of investment . I believed this to be a development and clarification of Wicksell 's natural rate of interest ' , which was , according to him , the rate which would preserve the stability of some , not quite clearly specified , price-level . I had , however , overlooked the fact that in any given society there is , on this definition , a different natural rate of interest for each hypothetical level of employment . And , similarly , for every rate of interest there is a level of employment for which that rate is the natural ' rate , in the sense that the system will be in equilibrium with that rate of interest and that level of employment . Thus it was a mistake to speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the above definition would yield a unique value for the rate of interest irrespective of the level of employment . I had not then understood that , in certain conditions , the system could be in equilibrium with less than full employment . I am now no longer of the opinion that the concept of a natural ' rate of interest , which previously seemed to me a most promising idea , has anything very useful or significant to contribute to our analysis . It is merely the rate of interest // which will preserve the status quo ; and , in general , we have no predominant interest in the status quo as such . If there is any such rate of interest , which is unique and significant , it must be the rate which we might term the neutral rate of interest , namely the natural rate in the above sense which is consistent with full employment , given the other parameters of the system . ' Why all this fuss ? And why the wording that tends to pooh-pooh the importance of the neutral ' rate ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propensity to save and the prospective marginal productivity of capital . But these are the determinants of the equilibrium rate of interest in classical economics . The neutral ' rate puts his system within the schema of traditional political economy . He was rather naughty in wanting to seem more of a revolutionary than he really was . In this field his masterly contribution was his analysis of the forces governing the market rate of interest . But his most fundamental contribution in his whole work was his demonstration that there could be equilibrium with substantial unemployment , and that a downward revision of wages would not serve to cure that . Some commentators have suggested that Keynes 's system depends on wages being inflexible downwards , as indeed they usually are in these days . This shows a complete lack of intellectual grasp of his system . His theory of equilibrium with unemployment in no wise depends on wages being inflexible downwards . Why is there a liquidity preference ? Some who have cash in hand may need to use it at dates and in amounts that are not at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they may be caught short by a fall in the value of the securities , i.e. a rise of interest rates , just when they want to use the money . If they are to be persuaded to buy securities , they must be paid some interest as an inducement to incur the risk . So interest has to be paid because there is uncertainty about the future rate of interest . I will quote here from my original book.2 Criticisms have been made of this theory on the ground that it leaves interest suspended , so to speak , in a void , there being interest because there is interest . Professor Robertson 's subtle Footnote // thoughts on economics have for long solaced the hearts of economists , and great weight is due to any criticism he makes . I quote from page 25 of his Essays in Monetary Theory : Thus the rate of interest is what it is because it is expected to become other than it is ; if it is not expected to become other than it is there is nothing left to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which secretes it has been amputated , and yet it still somehow exists ? a grin without a cat ' . Mr Plumptre of Toronto , in an unpublished paper , has aptly compared the position of the lenders of money under this theory with that of an insurance company which charges its clients a premium , the only risk against which it insures them being the risk that its premium will be raised . If we ask what ultimately governs the judgments of wealth owners as to why the rate of interest should be different in the future from what it is today , we are surely led straight back to the fundamental phenomena of productivity and thrift . Or again , Mr Hicks writes : But to say that the rate of interest on perfectly safe securities is determined by nothing else but uncertainty of future interest rates seems to leave interest hanging by its own boot straps ; one feels an obstinate conviction that there must be more in it than that . ' Mr Hicks , however , does not base himself upon productivity and thrift but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into short-dated securities , long-term interest being on this view ultimately governed by short-term interest . These criticisms suggest that the Keynes theory of interest is circular ; there is interest because the rate of interest is expected to change ; in fine , there is interest , because there is expected to be interest . But why is there expected to be interest ? I do not think that this criticism is decisive . Surely there are some phenomena of the mind ? and interest is nothing but a phenomenon of the mind , the resultant of thoughts and opinions , hopes and fears , itself only a promise , finally indeed an act , but one solely originating in the will of the parties , not a physical phenomenon at all ? surely there are mental phenomena to which the dictum may correctly be applied that there is nothing true but thinking makes it so . // And I am inclined to think that this account of interest hanging by its own boot straps is an exaggeration . Consider a security with a certain par value due in twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present value of ? Ioo of such stock would be ? 150 . This is a definite sum of money . But the market does not value the stock at ? 150 , but at some lower figure , say , ? Ioo , to allow for the fact that the holder can not be sure of getting the exact calculated sum , whatever it may be , between ? 15o and Lioo , at a date of his own choosing in the next twenty years . But , it will be objected that if there is no interest , and it is known that there will not in any case be any interest , will he not have a certainty of getting this appropriate sum ? But this assumption is too farreaching . In fairness to Keynes , I do not think we are entitled to assume , in rebutting the theory of liquidity preference , a world in which it was known that there never could be any interest , presumably a world in which there never had been any interest ! And are not the critics going a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the sole and only reason why there ever had been or could be interest ? Or did he not rather merely say that liquidity preference was the sole determinant of the level of the current market rate of interest ? I am not prepared to reject Keynes 's theory , even in the stripped form in which his critics present it , as untenable . It is certainly much more realistic than the other two possible theories that I have touched on . On the other hand I do not think that Keynes compels us to suppose that the market in brooding upon future prices , and on the uncertainties thereof , pays no regard whatever to Professor Robertson 's productivity and thrift ' . In this passage I was much too weak in my defence of Keynes . I may have been ebloui by his pugnacious attitude to the classical doctrine , and have thought that he had departed further than he actually had . In the earlier work the natural ' rate of interest is that which brings saving into equality with investment ; this is classical doctrine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to investment , there are numerous natural rates conjugated with various levels of unemployment and a unique // neutral rate . It is the market rate that is governed by what people think that the future rate of interest will be . If there were not underlying forces of productivity and thrift , the market would doubtless conclude that there would never be any positive rate of interest . I am confident that Keynes would have agreed with this . It is right to add that Keynes held that , in times of deep depression and surplus unused productive capacity , no rate of interest , however low , would serve to bring the economy to full employment . The neutral ' rate evaporated or , rather , assumed a high negative value ; but the actual interest rate can not have a negative value . Money supply policy would have to be supplemented by Public Works ? more broadly , fiscal policy ' ? if full employment were to be secured . Keynes 's system is one of macro-statics . It is time to go over to dynamics . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Cr , and , consequently the warranted growth rate . Its effect on sd is , as has already been explained , uncertain . Do people save more or less when the rate of interest is high ? A high saving ratio is conjugated with a high warranted growth rate . I assume that we are dealing with a moderate range of interest rates , such as prevails in fairly advanced countries , and not with rates of the order of 50 per cent . The effect of the rate on Cr is unequivocal . A low rate will tend to cause more capital intensive methods of production and , pro tanto , will be associated with a lower warranted growth rate . More of the available saving is taken up with financing more capitalistic methods and less accordingly left over for growth as such . While the interest rate is in principle a determinant of Cr , I have always stressed that in my own judgement , as a practical matter , it has a minimal influence on the capital-intensity of methods of production chosen . There are so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sufficient cadres of technologists , engineers , etc . A more capital-intensive method of production may require a larger supporting force of highly qualified people ; or it could , in cases , be the other way round . Very important are the relative prices of the inputs other than capital disposal . We have already seen that it was the high price of human labour relatively to the prices of coal and other materials that caused the great increase // of capital intensity in the U.S.A. in the late nineteenth century , although interest rates were running at a higher level than in the U.K. Thus in practice the effect of the interest rate on saving ? but we are fairly ignorant about what this is ? might have a more significant influence on the warranted growth rate than its effect on the capital intensity of productive methods . The next question that arises is whether we can frame a concept of a warranted rate of interest , to be conjugated with the warranted growth rate . Since the rate of interest is a determinant of sd and Cr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fundamental equation is not logically complete unless something can be said about the level of a normal interest rate appropriate to the warranted growth rate . It is assumed that , when there is an upward or downward departure from the ( unstable ) equilibrium of steady growth , monetary policy will be used to check these movements , establishing a supernormal rate to restrain a boom and a subnormal rate to correct a recession . But what should the rate be when all is in fact going forward steadily ? I have not been able to frame a satisfactory concept . In the long run this may not greatly matter , whether I am right or wrong in holding that the rate of interest does not have an important influence on sd and C , . Opinion in most countries is moving away from the ideal of laissez-faire capitalism , to which the concept of a warranted growth relates . There are two stages in this . It is now almost universally agreed that deliberate monetary policy , and , perhaps , also fiscal policy , should be used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control the business cycle . But opinion is now going further than this . It is coming to be held in wider circles that monetary and fiscal policies should be used to reduce unemployment ( Keynesian macro-statics ) and to ensure growth more nearly in accordance with the potential of the economy ( growth theory ) . It may be too much to hope that the target of securing natural ' growth , as I have defined it , will be achieved in the near future . But there will be attempts in that direction . Then what becomes all important is to determine what rate of interest is conjugated with natural growth ; I call this the optimum rate of interest . Here the going is much easier . I shall discuss it later in this chapter . // An idea that occurred to me in seeking for a concept for warranted interest was that it should be that which would obtain , if the monetary authorities increased the money supply at the same rate as that at which the national income was growing . The amount of money would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of goods and at the same time to increase the pool of liquidity , as required by the precautionary motive . This pool would presumably also grow , in the absence of special reasons to the contrary , at the same rate as national income . It might , of course , grow at a greater rate , if uncertainties were increasing , e.g. because rich people growing richer are more volatile in their incremental expenditures than poor people growing a little less poor . But I am not fully content with this attempt at a definition . It is now needful to make a somewhat lengthy digression . It is with diffidence that I put myself into opposition to a view that has been extremely widely held recently , and also has respectable origins . The view is that , if there is a firm expectation of inflation , this expected increase of prices is reflected in the current rate of interest . Thus , if the interest rate on bonds would have been 3 per cent in the absence of the expectation of inflation , and if it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 per cent p.a. within the relevant time-horizon , the actual rate will stand at 6 per cent p.a . This view was held by the distinguished economist Alfred Marshall and referred to in his evidence on bi-metallism and the rupee , and propounded with his customary vigour by Irving Fisher , whose excellent doctrine about interest and the diminishing utility of income has already been referred to . Recent events have seemed to confirm the theory , with interest rates soaring to levels to find a precedent for which one would have to go back to the Middle Ages , and with inflation rampant . Holders of this view may , or ought to have been , a little disconcerted by the substantial fall of interest rates in most countries in 1970 and early 1971 , when price inflation was on a plateau in some countries and still climbing in others , and the pessimistic view that high price inflation was likely to be endemic was growing stronger . ( This was before the stance taken by the British Chancellor on 19 July 1971 and by the American President on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to combat inflation. ) // Keynes did not accept the view that the prosect of rising prices would raise the market rate of interest . In this I agree with him . The point is that cash and bonds are both denominated in money . The rate of interest on bonds is the cost of going out of bonds into money , or , to put it the other way , it is the premium one receives if one goes out of money into bonds . It is , so to speak , the rate at which money exchanges for bonds . Since neither of these assets contains a hedge against inflation , it is not logical to affirm that the emergence of a sure prospect of inflation can alter the rate at which they exchange with each other . What is not logical can not be accepted into the corpus of economic theory . What the emergence of a sure prospect of inflation can do is to alter the relative valuation of those assets like bonds that have no hedge against and those that do , such as equities and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixties the yield on equities dropped relatively to the yield on bonds both in the U.K. and the U.S.A. ; indeed in both countries the yield on a fair sample of equities for the first time dropped below that on Government bonds . Meanwhile the values of various kinds of durable objets d'art , which also have a hedge against inflation , went soaring . It has been objected that the yield on bonds , as determined by liquidity preference and the quantity of money outside the transactions circuit , may not be high enough to give a margin between their yield and the yield on equities equal to the prospective rate of inflation . The yield on equities can not fall below zero or even to zero . So if one can not get a sufficient spread between the yield on equities and that on bonds by the fall in the yield on equities , that on bonds must rise . It must be noted , however , that , although one may speak of a certain prospect of inflation , there can never be absolute certainty . Let us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inflation , or merely in the expectation about prospective inflation . If this happened , it could cause a downward movement in the capital values of equities . Some investors in any kind of securities may desire to realise in due course ; that is the object of having a capital market . If it so happens that an investor has need to realise at the time of the downward slither , he will make a capital loss . The net yield to him of the equity securities in // question will have been the dividends that he has received minus the capital loss on sale . If the prices of the equities are standing at a high level at the time of purchase , the downward slither may not cause a greater proportionate loss than if they had been standing at a lower level ; but the absolute loss will be greater , and it is the absolute loss that has to be subtracted from the dividends received , to determine the net yield ? presumably negative ? of the equities to the investor . Now the representative investor may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a downward slither . Then one should apply a very small probability fraction in assessing the amount of loss , should a downward slither occur . Of course in principle one would have to calculate for a range of downward slithers of various sizes . It may be argued that there is an equal probability of an unexpected upward slither . But , as is well known in actuarial matters , a 5 per cent chance of a loss of , say , ? Ioo , 000 is not fully offset by a 5 per cent chance of a gain of ! ' Ioo , 000 . Of course bonds may bump up and down for quite different reasons . But , if their yield has been higher , the net loss on the occasion of an equi-proportionate downward bump will be lower . Accordingly I suggest that there is some yield above zero ( price less than infinite ) that enables equities to be a sufficient hedge for expectations of inflation within reasonable limits . It is represented that on occasions of great inflation , like that of the Reichsmark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fantastic heights , like 50 per cent . Argue it as one may , it is futile to try to claim that such rates had nothing to do with inflation . I submit that on occasions of great inflation , the position is somewhat different . People are no longer comparing the merits of cash and bonds . The value of the total cash in the economy plummets ; to all intents and purposes people cease holding cash , except for their barest immediate needs . It ceases to be thought of as one of two kinds of money-denomin-ated assets . I recall long queues of Germans in my bank in Berlin waiting to use their weekly pay to buy some securities , although they fully intended in the next week to sell them in order to do their shopping . My landlady , who had some cash in hand , but wanted to save herself the bother of going round to the bank , while I wanted to shop , offered to buy my paperback // edition of Hobbes 's Leviathan . She was not at all a philosophical lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impounded into the current rate of interest is , in my opinion , unacceptable . But I should like to suggest a compromise position as regards the relation of inflation to the rate of interest . The commonly held view is that it is the certainty , or strongly held belief , that inflation will proceed at a certain rate that is reflected into the interest rate . I suggest , on the contrary , that it is uncertainty about what may happen as regards inflation that can affect the interest rate . If there is certainty or a strong belief that inflation will proceed , there will be persistent bidding for assets with a hedge against inflation and their prices will go up . The prospect of inflation may at a given point of time add to such assets , by stimulating real capital formation . It may also cause fraudulent people to produce a substantial quantity of sham objets d'art . But in relation to the total stock of real capital , its increase will be on the small side . Accordingly the increase of supply of assets containing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fears about inflation , will be rather small ; the elasticity of supply of such assets will be low . Thus , on the occasion of an inflection of the curve of anticipated inflation , supply and demand will be balanced mainly by a rise in the prices of assets or durable objects containing a hedge against inflation . Investors will judge how far they want to go in sacrificing present income , in order to provide themselves with a hedge against inflation . That decision having been taken , they will have a residue to be divided between the two kinds of moneydenominated assets , bonds and cash . The decision about how to divide these assets will be taken on standard Keynesian principles of liquidity preference . The decision having been taken about how much present income to sacrifice , owing to the sure , or almost sure , prospect of a given rate of inflation , the further decision as to how to divide money-denominated assets between bonds and cash will be determined in the following way . There is nothing in the certain prospect of inflation ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ' for the sake of simplicity ? to influence this further division among moneydenominated assets . // But let uncertainty about the future course of inflation increase . This may be a motive for an investor to keep liquid . His liquidity preference ' schedule , i.e. his preference for cash , as against bonds , may rise . On the basis of a prospect of inflation of uncertain amount , he will have decided to sacrifice income by buying securities , real estate , etc. , as a hedge against it . But he may have it in mind that he has not gone far enough in this sacrifice , or , alternatively , that he may have gone needlessly far . When there is substantial uncertainty , he will have it in mind that within six months or a year the inflation prospect may well have deteriorated or improved . So he may decide to keep more liquid , in order , if the new situation suggests it , to be able to go more deeply into low-yielding ( or non-yielding ) assets having a hedge against inflation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ratio of bonds to cash in the whole economy will not be affected by the representative investor 's increased preference for cash , unless the central bank takes special measures to adapt the ratio . Consequently the increased preference for cash will cause the prices of bonds to fall , i.e. will cause the rate of interest to rise . This is in line with Keynes 's liquidity preference ' theory of the market rate of interest , but adds a new dimension to it . It is to be stressed that this view , that uncertainty about the degree of prospective inflation tends to raise the rate of interest , is entirely different from the crude view that a sure , or near sure , prospect of inflation increases the current rate of interest by that amount . In my judgement this crude idea that a sure ( or near sure ) prospect of future inflation is just written into the current rate of interest has done harm . Recently interest rates have been quite abnormally high , and this has probably injured world progress . ( More recently they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) When someone has urged that these high rates should be reduced , the relevant authorities tended to reply that it was impossible for them to bring this about , since the high rates were due to the sure prospect of inflation , and , whatever they did about the money supply , market rates of interest would continue to be high because of expected inflation . This is a fallacy . If the high interest rates are due to increased liquidity preference ( Keynes ) , owing to uncertainties about the future // course of inflation , they can be reduced by the authorities increasing liquidity ( Keynes ) . The level of interest rates is , to some extent , an international phenomenon . In my judgement , the high world level of interest rates that has been prevailing has been due to the increasing shortage of world reserves in ratio to international transactions . This can be remedied only by concerted action to check the downslide of world reserves . But the authorities in each particular country could contribute something by causing its own level of interest rates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this point the national authorities object that they can not cause their own interest rates to edge downwards , because these rates are governed by the prospective rate of inflation in their own countries . The determinants of the rates of domestic inflation will be discussed in the next chapter . It is the plea that nothing can be done to reduce domestic interest rates , because of the rate of inflation proceeding in each country , that has been doing great harm . At this point the digression ends . Finally , it remains to consider the optimal rate of interest , as conjugated with the natural growth rate . We have to return to the central concept of the diminishing marginal utility of a pound , when income is rising . We have seen that there are two elements in the time preference ' , which is the fundamental reason why interest exists at all : lack of telescopic faculty and the diminishing marginal utility of income . The former of these must be left out of account when we are considering an optimum . Here we are concerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economics that its practitioners should analyse how things work out in fact and also assess the extent to which the way they do work out is conducive to the greatest happiness that can be yielded by our economic resources . Traditionally for instance , although not necessarily rightly , monopoly has been deemed to cause a discord between what actually happens and the best that could happen . As judge and mentor , the economist must not assess a unit of happiness accruing in September 1971 as superior to a unit of happiness , of equal degree ? subject to difficulties of measurement ? accruing in September 1972 . It is for him to be aloof and Olympian as between one year and another . Of course he is subject , in his prescriptions , to uncertainty about the degree of // happiness that will be yielded by an event at a time removed from his own . He can know little about the shape of things to come or what will make human beings happy in A.D. 2071 . Nonetheless he should eschew any systematic psychological preference . Uncertainty about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefit by a risk element . But this is different from a systematic time preference , by which individuals attach more importance to a Christmas pudding now than to the same one next year . Of course he must discount future benefits by reference to the decreasing marginal utilities of incomes , when incomes are rising . The fundamental equation for the optimal interest rate is a ? pc ( Gn ( con ) ) ( I ) e a is the optimal rate of interest . pc ( Gn ( con ) ) is the per caput natural ( optimum ) growth rate and e is the elasticity of the marginal diminishing utility of income schedule . pc ( Gn ( con ) ) is in some degree determined by the rate of interest , so that simultaneous equations are involved . It is important to state at once that this rate of interest is taken to be the rate that should be used in the choice between methods of varying degrees of capital intensity for producing a given commodity or service . In the schema of the natural growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saving ratio is the determinand , namely that which is required to implement growth at its natural rate ; this ratio is independent of the propensity of individuals to save and consequently of the rate of interest , except to the extent that capital requirements ( Cr ) are dependent on that rate . What determines the degree of capital intensity in the method of production chosen , among the various methods available , may be called the minimum acceptable rate of return on capital ' . If this were zero , then , in choosing the method of production , we should simply take the one that showed the lowest total value of all kinds of input , other than waiting , as required per unit of output . But if some substantial sum has to be debited on account of inputs of waiting , that may twist the choice away from the more capital intensive methods . // The minimum acceptable rate of return on capital ' in advanced societies appears to be considerably above the market rate of interest on first-class securities . This may be partly on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a security that can be sold , admittedly perhaps at a loss , in a capital market , and another to embody capital disposal in a specific type of plant , which can be redeemed only when that plant sweats out its output over a term of years . There may be other reasons . A firm may be unwilling to have too much of its capital in the hands of bond or share holders . It may also carry this idea into the future , when it may foresee that there will be opportunities for real capital extension more remunerative than any now available ; if it goes up to the desirable limit in depending on outside capital now , it might have the choice in future of either going beyond that limit or of foregoing opportunities for extension that would be more remunerative than any now available . Again firms may be held back from paying projects by the maximum rate at which managerial personnel , well qualified to handle the specific problems , can be built up . If one put pcGn(con) at 5 per cent p.a. and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give a minimum acceptable rate of return on capital of 10 per cent p.a . This is well below the rates commonly prevailing , which may suggest that the methods of production in capitalist societies are usually not capitalintensive enough . I have the impression that the minimum acceptable rate of return under capitalism is somewhat insensitive to moderate changes in the market rate of interest and to all short period changes . Firms have their regular methods of assessing prospective costs , including a standard rate of mark-up for profit . Their cost accountants do not hang over the telephone to get the latest news of interest rate changes ; this is a further reason for holding that these interest rate changes may not have a substantial influence on the method of production chosen under capitalism . Monetary policy , which I believe to be very potent , works in quite a different manner . Easy money causes some firms to go forward with capital projects , the return on which 1 See my reference to the results of two separate econometric investigations by Dr A. P. Barton and Dr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 and 0.53 respectively ( Economic journal , September 1963 , p. 408 ) . // would anyhow have been quite acceptable , but from which they have been held back by lack of available finance . It may well be , however , that the large and rather long lasting increase of interest rates in recent years has caused many firms to raise their standard rates of mark-up , when costing , i.e. their minimum acceptable rate of return on capital ' invested . This would tend to reduce the capital intensity adopted for fresh projects , and also , indeed , for replacements to worn-out capital . I define elasticity ( e ) in the manner of Alfred Marshall rather than by its converse as used by some more recent writers : where u stands for the marginal utility of income , which goes down as income rises . Thus if a I per cent increase of income causes a 2 per cent decline in marginal utility , e is the elasticity of a community utility function . This is a notion somewhat alien to traditional economics . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the theory of international trade . Every individual has his own marginal utility of income function . Assessment of those of the separate citizens would be beyond computation . But there are likely to be significant differences , assessable ( subject to wide margins of error ) , between the utility functions of those in different income brackets . The community utility function would be an average of the functions of each bracket , weighted , not by the total of income in each bracket , but by the number of heads in each bracket . One might introduce a further complication : if the number of heads per income earner were significantly different in the different income brackets , a cross-section analysis would then be desirable . In the old days this would have sounded formidable , but with computer-assisted methods of calculation it should not be so . In former times ? anyhow in the nineteenth // century ? it was the poor who had larger families , but this has been rapidly changing . In big families e is presumably larger than in small ones . The concept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edgeworth , to whom , as inventor of the indifference curve , Pareto expressed indebtedness , was firmly of the belief that , in matters relating to utility , cardinal measurement would always continue to be indispensable . Indeed , he poured scorn on the contrary idea . The historic origin of the felt need for an indifference curve was that the demand curve uses money as a measure of utility , and any measure ' should have a constant quantity of the thing that it measures . But any exchange transaction itself alters the marginal utility of money , so that money does not retain constancy of utility . ( For small transactions , however , the alteration in its utility is negligible . ) But in measuring income , we are not involved in an exchange . Indeed , money can be left out of it . We can measure income in terms of basketsful of commodities , properly weighted . One of the greatest economists of a later generation , Dr Ragnar Frisch , agrees with me that we have to retain cardinal measurement of utility . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them arises because the value of the expression on the righthand side of equation I depends , even if possibly only to a very small degree , on the value of ro. r stands for interest rate . If the number of consumers rises at the same rate as that of producers , then , ceteris faribus , pcGn(con) = Gn(con) . But it may not do so , owing a changing age distribution and a changing participation rate . The relation between the two can be expressed as pcGn(con) = f ( Gn ( con ) ) ( 2 ) If so retains a constant value through time , G(con)n = Gn . But it will not do so , unless technological progress is neutral . So we need an equation to express this : G(con)n = ( ! ; . ( Gn ) ( 3 ) Technological progress has been defined as one that leaves the capital-output ratio ( Cr ) unchanged , at a given rate of interest . But at what rate of interest ? For realism in this analysis 8o ECONOMIC DYNAMICS the rate of interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return on capital ( MARC ) . And so we have Thus we have four equations for four unknowns , namely rQ , pcGn(con) , Gn(con) and Gn . Finally I may add that this somewhat complicated set-up , as required to determine the optimum rate of interest does not strike me as very important , since I do not believe that the rate of interest , anyhow within the limits normally prevailing in advanced societies , has much effect on the capital intensity of the methods of production chosen . Our economies would do well enough on a common sense evaluation of the minimum acceptable rate of return on capital of , say , i o per cent , well below those currently prevailing , based on an estimate of potential growth of 5 per cent ( on the low side ) and an elasticity of the income utility schedule of . 6 Inflation The word inflation ' is used in different senses , which , however , are related to each other . This may be bad for communication and even for thinking . A reader or listener may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one sense when in fact he intends another . Worse , its user himself may not know what he does mean . Time and again , especially recently , when this word has been employed , I have been quite confident that its user could not stand up to an examination on what he thought that he meant by it . The harm may go further still and cause confusion in policy-making itself . It would probably be a good thing if its use was strictly outlawed , if only that were possible . It is a fairly new word . It is not to be found in nineteenthcentury dictionaries , except in the sense of blowing up a balloon . In those days they had to make do with such terms as debasement or depreciation of the currency . The original sense probably combines inseparably the ideas of monetary and fiscal official policies . The government was said to inflate when it spent more than its income and financed its deficit by printing notes , or , in our modern sophisticated world , by borrowing from the central bank , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inflation were the issue of assignats by the French revolutionary government of 1789 and the issue of notes in the American Civil War . At an earlier date ( 1717 ) there was the note issue by the French , under the advice of John Law , to finance various projects . Historically , a country 's currency was supposed to consist of , or to be convertible into , a certain weight of precious metal , and even after the Second World War currencies of countries held by the monetary authorities of other countries were thus convertible ? whether this system has permanently broken down is not yet known ( September 1971 ) . Did the idea of inflation ' entail that the issue of notes , etc. had been carried so far that // convertibility had to be suspended ? I believe so . It was certainly so in the French and American cases cited . This is a matter requiring detailed linguistic research . It was generally recognised that the sudden upsurge of government expenditures in major wars , combined with the technical difficulties in getting parallel tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the word was used both in active and in passive senses . It might be used for the actions of the naughty governments in issuing an excessive quantity of notes , etc. , or for the state of affairs that resulted from that , namely the consequent rise of prices as denominated in the national currency . More recently the word has been applied to milder events . In this connection does it still have the double sense , relating both to what the authorities have done ( active ) and also to what is actually occurring ( passive ) ? It seems that it does not always have this double sense . In the discussion of the relation of the rate of interest to expected inflation in the last chapter , it was used only in the passive sense of rising prices , whatever the cause might be . The word is now often used for any rise of prices whatsoever . Thus it is sometimes said that an inflation of 2 per cent is tolerable ' . After the gold and silver discoveries in the American continent in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although more moderate , phenomenon , occurred owing to gold discoveries in California and Australia in the 184os . Would modern usage affirm that there was inflation ' in those periods ? If so , the word would not have a double ( active and passive ) sense . Governments were not responsible for the discoveries of the precious metals . It would surely not be said that the gold diggers were inflating ' the currencies of the world . There is an analogous contemporary problem . In parts of the 1969 ? 71 period prices in the U.K. and U.S.A. rose at a rate unprecedented in peacetime . But the governments were not printing an abnormal quantity of notes , etc. nor borrowing in abnormal quantities . The price increases were due to the granting of excessive wage increases . Here again the word inflation ' must be taken to be used in a passive sense only . Some might argue that the government had actuated inflation because it had not taken the steps needed to prevent the wage increases . // This is stretching the use of language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could it have done to check the wage increases ? Oh ' , some say , it should have deflated . ' Here we reach the very pitch of mental confusion . One is reminded of Keynes 's duck that dived down to the bottom of the pond and got entangled in the weeds . A large inflation in the passive sense ( increase of prices ) was occurring . Apparently the active counterpart of this phenomenon was that the authorities were not deflating ? whatever that may mean . Presumably it means having tighter money or a larger budget surplus . But would such deflation ' have checked the rampant inflation ? It is by no means certain . What a terminological tangle ! But it is worse than that . It is tangled thinking , leading to tangled policy . Recently people have settled down into thinking that some degree of annual inflation , moderate , it is to be hoped , will continue to be with us as far as the eye can see . This is a rather lamentable defeatism . One might almost regard it as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look , we do not find that inflation was endemic in England . For nearly a century after the Restoration ( 166o ) the general trend of prices was downward , subject to transitory wartime interruptions . In the later part of the eighteenth century there was a moderate upward movement , doubtless connected with wars , but at the time of the outbreak of the war against the French revolution , prices were still not far from the 166o level . Then came the great inflation , including suspension of convertibility . After the war the downward movement , again subject to interruptions , was resumed , and by 185o prices were below the pre-war level . There was a flattening out in the middle of the century , probably due to the Californian and Australian gold discoveries already mentioned , after which a strong downturn was resumed , bringing prices in 1896 way below their 166o level . Then came the South African gold discoveries and in particular the invention of the cyanide process , and also the South African war . These events were accompanied and followed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices were not above the 166o level . Then between the two world wars , there was not complete recovery from the great inflation of the first , but prices were trending downwards.1 Footnote // Why is all to be changed now ? Why do we have to live in a brave new world of continuing inflation ? Some of us have advocated a large immediate rise in the price of gold . Have we thereby joined the ranks of inflationists ? It has been counter-argued that this rise would open up the prospect of successive increases in the price of gold in future and would thereby stimulate its hoarding . I have always stressed that a rise in the price of gold should be accompanied by a firm and authoritative statement , preferably by some international authority , like the International Monetary Fund , that it had no intention of sponsoring further increases in future , but that the rise was designed as a once-over adjustment to the depreciation in the commodity values of paper currencies during and after the Second World War . A trebling of the price of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other commodities . It just is not feasible , and indeed in all the circumstances would not be desirable , to reduce the general level of commodity prices , as expressed , say , in the dollar , to their 1939 level . It is those who argue that a change in the price of gold now implies the need for further successive changes in the future that are the real inflationists . The implication is that the currency prices of goods and services will continue up and up ; consequently , if gold is to retain its normal relation to other goods , its price in terms of currencies would have to be moved up successively . If we could achieve stable prices for the general run of goods and services , then the price of gold could also stay put . It is of course possible that , owing to the limited quantity of mineral deposits and the increasing output of goods and services due to rising world population and productivity , the output of gold would not keep pace with that of other goods . In that case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desirable ? to supplement , and in the end supplant , the use of gold by international paper money , such as the Special Drawing Rights . But it is idle to suppose that these can suddenly be increased in quantity right away by enough for us to be able to dispense with gold as a medium of reserve for international settlement . An increase in the price of gold would provide us with a bridge between now and the time , some decades hence , when we can rely exclusively on international paper money as the sole reserve // for international settlements . This advocacy of an increase in the price of gold is not to be identified with acquiescence in continuing inflation ; the increase would be a retro-active measure . It has been indicated that from 166o the pound sterling preserved its commodity value , subject to ups and downs , until 1913 . Looking further back , we may judge the matter in relation to debasements of the coins of the realm in terms of the precious metals . Our pennies date back at least to King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyhow , used to be , taught . ' Within a century 240 of these came to be called a pound ' . William the Conquerer had a lump of metal in the Tower of London and ordained that the silver penny should be of such a weight that 240 of them weighed the same as his lump of metal ( the tower pound ' , slightly different from a troy pound ) . What a beastly thing it is that some bureaucrats should have wantonly destroyed a national institution dating back , without intermission , for a thousand years or more of our history ! There are not many things in daily use by every man that he can think of as having been handed straight down from William the Conqueror ( or even King Offa ) . Surely daily reminders of history add something to the pleasure of life . When I was at school I was taught that a duodecimal system of numbers would probably , before too long , replace our present decimal system . Two extra numerical signs would be required and one-nought ( to ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage would be that the new i o would be divisible by four , instead of only by two , numbers . However , things have not gone that way . Our 240 pennies to the pound were a mixture of decimal and duodecimal . We might have had a great reform , by which we had 12 ( as we now call it ) pennies , written to pence , to the shilling , which dates back to the sixteenth century , and 10 shillings to the pound , giving us 144 pennies ( but written 1 oo pence ) to the pound . That would indeed have made calculating very much easier . After William the Conqueror there was no debasement at all for about two centuries . By the time of Henry VIII , a culprit , the content of the penny had fallen to about one-half . Not a bad record for some five centuries . Between the recoinage of Queen Footnote // Elizabeth I and 1931 there was only a small fractional debase-ment , partly due to the transition from a silver to a gold standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout our period of civilised history , apart from intervals of serious war . After the wars there was recovery and prices resumed their downward trend . It is only since the Second World War that things have been otherwise . And not only that ; there is the acquiescence in a continuance of inflation into an indefinite future . Have we gone flabby ? Have two serious wars undermined our stamina ? Of course the phenomenon of inflation has not been confined to Britain . Keynes 's principal equation in his Treatise does not represent a macro-static nor a dynamic equilibrium , but it has one cardinal merit . It shows by separate terms the contributions of a cost push and a demand pull to an increase of prices . P is the price level of liquid consumption goods , E th e earnings of the community per unit of time , 0 total output in the same period , I ' the cost of production of new investment , S quantity of saving , as defined in the Treatise manner , already explained , and R the volume of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this set-up , but it need not concern us . The main point is the clear demarcation of the two separate forces bearing on the course of prices . This is lost sight of in the General Theory where wage units ' are taken as the unit of measurement . In this earlier Treatise version of Keynes 's thinking demand pull arises from the inequality of saving , as specially defined , and investment . In the General Theory Keynes repudiated his special definition of saving and argued strongly that it was better in the basic theory not to have any special definition of saving by which it could be unequal to investment . He had become embroiled in controversies with D. H. Robertson and Dr Fritz von Hayek , who each had their different special definitions . Yet there is a felt need for some kind of concept of this sort . Some favour the ex ante concept of Gunnar Myrdal . In the dynamic theory of this volume an analogous distinction is that // between S , actual saving , and Sd , desired saving . This seems preferable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because S and Sd both obtain simultaneously at a given point of time . What has happened in the past may often be irrelevant . In the General Theory demand pull inflation arises from aggregate effective demand in real terms exceeding the supply potential of the economy . That may be a better approach than his earlier one . But in the later volume cost push , as a separate and independent factor operating on prices , which stands out so clearly in the Treatise equation , largely disappears from view . That , in my judgement , has had an unfortunate effect on some subsequent developments of theory , and on policy also . It must not be inferred that Keynes in the Treatise was a keen exponent of the idea of an inflation originating in a wage push . Rather the contrary . The general tenor of his thinking was that inflations usually originate from a demand pull and that increases in E/O are caused by demand pulls . In their scramble for available labour during a demand pull phase , employers would become more permissive in handing out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point is , that even if rises in E/O are caused by demand pull inflation , the effect of such rises is additive . A demand pull may be measured in terms of existing prices , i.e. before the inflation takes effect , as the excess of aggregate demand over the supply potential of the economy . One may express this as a sum of money , say L2 billion , or as a percentage , say 5 per cent . At first this excess may lead to a depletion of stocks ; but in due course these will be reconstituted . Sooner or later , prices on the overall average must rise by 5 per cent , if aggregate demand is to be brought into equality with supply . Consumers will be compelled to revise their plans for purchasing , because they will just not have the money to maintain them when prices have risen . This flattening ( or decline ) of real consumer demand may lead to a downward revision of investment plans . Furthermore , in a boom the rise in demand may be stronger on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pull of prices there , than in the consumer goods sector . A squeeze may cause those ordering investment goods to make their contribution to a reduction of aggregate demand to the level of the supply potential of the economy . // In the foregoing it has been assumed that the prices of consumer goods rise while consumer incomes do not . The consequent squeeze on consumers will contribute to equating aggregate demand to the supply potential of the economy . But , in this environment , consumer incomes will probably rise by more than productivity increases . If they do , the price inflation in the economy will be more than 5 per cent . If employees obtain rises in excess of their increase of productivity , sufficient fully to compensate them for the initial price inflation , prices will in due course rise on the overall average , by I o per cent . The point is that , if , and for as long as , a demand pull obtains , prices have got to rise by more than E/O ( Earnings , but including only normal profit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in pushing up E , demand pull will defeat them . Prices will rise more than E/O by 5 per cent , or whatever the percentage may be ( = excess of real aggregate demand over supply potential ) . Recipients of the excess price increases will save the revenue thus accruing to them . A rise in E/O may occur in the absence of any demand-pull inflation . This was rather grudgingly admitted by Keynes , but he did not appear to regard it as important or likely to occur often . We have had much experience of it in recent years . If such a rise in E/O occurs , this will lead to a rise in prices . We may then get into a phase of what it is convenient to call wageprice spiralling . At the next round of bargains or contracts , employees are likely to demand increases , not only in proportion to their current rise in productivity , if they are so modest , but also with an increment of increase to compensate for the price inflation that has occurred since the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the rise of E/O at the last round , the attempt to compensate for the inflation since the last round will inevitably cause further inflation before the next round ; and so on . And in due course there can be an acceleration . After inflation has been proceeding merrily for a time , the employees may begin to ask for additional increases , not only to cover the inflation that has occurred since the last round , but also to cover further price increases as expected as likely to occur before the next . Producers who fix prices join in this game . On a review of their own prices , they may set them so as to cover probable wage and salary increases that may occur before the next // review . And so , the upward spiralling proceeds . Unless the authorities do something to get to grips with the matter , the spiralling may accelerate . It is sometimes argued that , in the absence of demand pull , producers will be unable to put up prices . This is doubtless true in the case of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competition . But in developed countries the major part of the output of goods and services is not so marketed ; there may be very active competition in many cases , without there being perfect ' competition in the technical sense . The competitor has a double reason for pushing cost increases on into prices . First , he may find , on doing his costing , that , if he does not raise his prices , he will be running at a loss and accordingly will eventually have to pack up . Secondly , he will probably argue that his competitors , being in the same boat , will have to do the same , so that he will not lose out in competition with them . Those generalisations are naturally subject to exceptions in particular cases . It is true that there have from time to time been squeezes on profit during the course of spiralling . The normal cause of such a squeeze , however , is not wage-price spiralling , but demand deflation , a very different matter . Whatever may be happening about wage-price spiralling and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the fraction of their incomes that consumers like to spend and the fraction of the productive resources required for justifiable real capital formation do not add up to one . Failure to understand this simple proposition , which is one of the most fundamental of economic dynamics has been the cause of the ( irrational ) surprise of some when they see strong price inflation accompanied by serious unemployment . It is argued by some that , even if there is no current demand pull , the spiralling must be due to a demand occurring some time back ? two , three , four years ? Why ? It is true that a phase of demand pull may set a process of wage-price spiralling going . This is an important reason for the authorities to be very vigilant about demand pull , and to correct it promptly , as soon as they see symptoms of it . It is one thing to affirm , very reasonably , that a phase of demand pull may be what sets a given wage-price spiralling going . It is quite another thing to affirm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Economic theory gives no justification for such a generalisation . When there is spiralling , one may look around for an earlier year of demand-pull inflation . If one looks far enough , one can usually find one . But in affirming causation , one must watch quantities . It is often said that the recent ( 1971 ) strong wage-price spiralling in the U.S.A. was the effect of demand pull inflation caused by the Vietnam war . It is urged that taxation as required to finance it was not raised soon enough . At an earlier period there was a Korean war , when the demand pull was greater . Defence expenditure was at its peak in 1952 . ( The peak came after the war was over and was due to the alarm caused by it in the U.S.A. , which had let its defence apparatus run right down after the Second World War . ) In 1952 defence expenditure absorbed 13.3 per cent of G.N.P . In 1967 , the peak connected with Vietnam , it absorbed only 9.1 per cent of G.N.P . The Federal deficit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peak ) . In 1967 it was somewhat less at 1.7 per cent . In the four years following Korea consumer prices rose up by only 2.4 per cent . In the three and a half years following Vietnam they rose up by 18.5 per cent . If the recent vast wage price spiralling was due to a moderate , and considerably earlier , demand pull associated with Vietnam , why did none such occur after the larger demand pull of Korea ? The Federal Reserve policy should also be considered . In 1967 the system increased the money supply by 8 per cent after a restrictive year ( 1966 ) in which the increase had been 3.2 per cent only . In early 1968 its policy was strict ; there had been prolonged Congressional delay in passing the surtax , which had been considered a desirable fiscal supplement to monetary restraint . When at length it was passed in mid-1968 , the Federal Reserve , fearing that the surtax , which may by this time have been no longer necessary , would have too restrictive an effect , eased its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over-compensated for the restrictive surtax . It increased the money supply by the annual rate of 11 per cent in the second half of the year ; but in 1968 as a whole the increase was only 6.7 per cent . There may have been particular phases open to criticism . But it can not be argued that there were excesses of INFLATION 9I comparable order of magnitude to the great increases in consumer prices that followed . There was a similar absence of excess in monetary and fiscal policies in the U.K. Indeed , in 1968 the British authorities began building Budget surpluses of huge magnitude , quite without precedent in the U.K. or any other country . The banking policy was quite moderate . And yet the inflation of wages and prices was very great and substantially larger than that in the U.S.A. Why then did these inflations occur ? Events must have causes . In my opinion these causes are not to be found among factors to which the term economic can by usage be applied ? supply and demand pressures , relations of marginal productivity to marginal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be analysed with the aid of concepts belonging to a wider field of sociology . There may occur a greater degree of activism on the part of those asking for more pay . We are going to fight for this ; do not think that you can get away with it by a negative attitude . ' On the side of those who grant increases , there may be more permissiveness . This is balanced by greater activism on their part on the other side of the counter , a shameless putting up of prices , in its turn confronted by greater permissiveness on the part of the final buyers . In the old days there was often sharp and angry protest by the customer , used to paying a certain price for a certain object , if that price was raised . He might withdraw his custom from the shop . Nowadays price increases are accepted as part of the natural order of things without much protest . We know that there is something called " inflation " going on , and we have to accept this sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting more pay themselves . And thus the vicious circle ? vicious spiral ? is completed . Pensioners and others with fixed incomes are the victims and their consequent suffering is often great . They may have to abandon their planned way of life . But still the basic cause eludes us . Why should important sections of the population become more activist in a certain period of history ? I believe the cause to be due to the rising real standard of living . There may be a crucial strand in the upward-sloping shore , where earners are sufficiently raised above subsistence living for their anxieties to drop . State // assistance in its various forms doubtless contributes to relief from anxiety . One is reminded of the greatest sociologist of them all , de Tocqueville . For many years people believed that the French Revolution was the final flare up of the French population , progressively ground down in increasing poverty and misery , until they could bear it no longer . In his L'Ancien Regime de Tocqueville shows that the eighteenth century was for France a period of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But there was a growing concentration of power in the hands of the not very efficient bureaucracy in Paris . Meanwhile the people were becoming more demanding ; their horizons had widened ; they had long since come out of the dark cave of abject poverty . So , not content with the improvements to date , they asked for more ? that the nobility should take their share in the burden of taxation , that the people should be given effective representation in the legislative process . As the child comes to participate more fully in the amenities of the grownups ' , he asks for more ' . Doubtless the demands of the French revolutionaries , at least in the early stages , were more justified and capable of being granted without injury , than the demands of earners for excessive pay increases , which , if not partly balanced by an increase of prices , would before long reduce profit to zero and bring free enterprise economies to an end . The greater recent uppishness ' in the inflationary sphere may be regarded as first cousin to other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the U.S.A. , racial troubles . If it is true that the cause of the acceleration of wage and price increases has sociological roots of the kind described , then it is idle to hope to cure the evil by the traditional remedies of tight money or budget surplus . These are geared to eliminating demand inflation . It is doubtful if they are suitable for correcting such moderate wage-price spiralling as may simply be the aftermath of a demand inflation . This will be further discussed . They are clearly entirely inappropriate for dealing with the much larger and disproportionate wage and price increases of the recent period . But this does not mean that we should passively acquiesce in the great evil . What is needed is a direct confrontation . We are just not going to allow you to destroy so much that is valuable in our society by your excessive activism. ' // The method of direct confrontation is what is known as incomes policy ' , consisting in official interference with the course of wages and prices . The target , unhappily not likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within a year or two , should be an overall average increase of wages not greater than that of productivity , and stable prices . It is still not beyond the bounds of possibility that this could be achieved by voluntary methods , based on an agreement in principle by leading industrialists and trade unionists . Some two months after the victory of the British Labour Party in the General Election of 1964 , Mr George Brown ( now Lord George-Brown ) thought that he had got an effective agreement and was photographed gaily holding up the relevant piece of paper . But in the event it proved not to be effective . If effective voluntary agreement can not be obtained , then methods with legal sanctions must be adopted . The evil is too great to be tolerated . That is surely the opinion of the democracy . It seems that the Conservative Government of Britain ( Mr Barber 's statement on 19 July 1971 ) and the Republican Government of the U.S.A. ( President Nixon 's statement on 15 August 1971 ) are both now committed to an incomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposed to one on doctrinal grounds . Why is something so new now required ? It is not unreasonable to expect , with progress , the need for novelties in economic policy , as in other spheres . The phenomenon of violent upsurges in prices and wages in peace time is new in industrial countries , and a new phenomenon may be expected to need some new method for coping with it . This is further enforced , if it is true that the new phenomenon has sociological causes outside the realm of economics , as we have hitherto understood it . And is direct interference entirely new ? For centuries in England maximum legal wages were fixed by the Justices of the Peace . Doubtless trade union leaders would not at present be disposed to hand the matter over to the J.P.s . So a new authority is required . The text in the foregoing paragraphs has become somewhat hortatory . Is there any reason why economic dynamics should not occasionally , like traditional economics , take on a flavour of political economy ? // The theoretical point is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theory either , that justifies the statement that wage or price inflation or wage-price spiralling must be caused by a simultaneous or preceding demand inflation ( aggregate demand the supply potential of the economy ) . It may be or it may not be . Empirical reasoning suggests that the recent wage and price inflation has not been so caused , because the quantities are wrong . In empirical reasoning one must always have regard to quantities . On 18 July 1969 , I wrote a letter to the Economist newspaper , on the matter of inflation , for which they provided a headline in the words ' Harrod 's dichotomy ' . It has already been explained how overall excess demand almost inevitably causes an increase of prices . There is a gap to be filled . This is quite different from the proposition , widely taken as axiomatic for a good many years now , that rising aggregate demand tends to raise prices . This , in relation to the history of economic thought since Adam Smith , is a comparatively novel doctrine . Traditional economics ( apart from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be called micro-statics . It was accordingly concerned with the determination of the prices of particular goods and services . When we pass over to macroeconomics ( static or dynamic ) we are concerned with the general price level . It is to be stressed that this general price level is determined by the sum of individual prices . One can not have the majority of the latter going up while the former goes down , or conversely . So we must examine the forces that govern the movement of particular prices . If an increase of demand does not tend on the overall average to raise the prices of each particular commodity , it can not tend to raise the general price level . Theory as regards particular prices used to be quite clear and regularly demonstrated on a blackboard to first-year classes in economics . An increase of demand would tend to raise prices in the case of commodities subject to diminishing returns and to reduce prices in the case of those subject to increasing returns . Thus , so far as the general price level is concerned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do or do not outweigh those subject to increasing returns . The // former consist primarily of food and raw materials and of those commodities in the cost of production of which raw materials have a heavy weight . In manufacture , and also in the growingly important sphere of services , increasing returns on the whole prevail . In advanced countries food ( diminishing returns ) consumption grows less than total expenditure ( in real terms ) . Furthermore , the raw material content of final products grows less , because with rising real income people tend towards using more of their incomes on the purchase of highly finished goods , in which the raw material content is lower . Thus in advanced countries one would expect the proportion of income devoted to the increasing returns sector to be higher than that devoted to the diminishing returns sector . Furthermore , there are more apt to be world prices for goods in the diminishing returns sector , than in that of increasing returns , since the former are bought and sold in perfect markets . While there is some tendency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grow , it remains lower than that for food and raw materials . There can not be world competition for the services provided in each separate country , apart from tourism , and these services are tending to be a growing proportion of all goods and services purchased in advanced countries . There is another point . The more subject a given article is to world pricing , the less effect will a given percentage increase in the demand for it in a particular country have on its price in that country . So , in considering the effect of an overall rise of demand in a particular country on the general level of prices in the country , one should give diminishing returns goods a lower weight than that which corresponds to their proportion of real national expenditure in that country . Thus , by traditional economics , one would expect a rise in aggregate demand to cause a fall in the general price level in advanced countries , and conversely . In relation to upward and downward movements in ( real ) aggregate demand , there are two quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are different in kind . This is of the essence of the Harrod dichotomy ' . If the real demand for goods and services is above the supply potential of the economy , there is a gap that has to be filled . If it is not filled by // rising prices , there must inevitably be a depletion of stocks . This depletion can not go on indefinitely , so that , in due course , the gap will have to be filled by price inflation . But if aggregate real demand is below the supply potential of the economy , there is no necessity for prices to fall by enough to fill the gap . It can be filled by a corresponding fall of production and increase of unemployment . We have seen this happen often enough . When aggregate real demand is above the supply potential of the economy , and price-inflation ensues by consequence , monetary and fiscal policies should be addressed to reducing aggregate real demand . There is an alternative here of logical necessity . Either the gap ( aggregate real demand supply potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ framed to reduce aggregate real demand to the supply potential , or it can be eliminated by the relevant amount of price inflation . There is no further alternative . But if aggregate real demand is below the supply potential , reducing aggregate real demand will have no necessary , or even probable , tendency to eliminate , or reduce any price inflation that may have been occurring . When aggregate real demand exceeds the supply potential there is a necessary tendency for prices to rise ( demand pull inflation ) . But when aggregate real demand is below the supply potential , there is no necessary tendency for prices to fall . If a wages pull is proceeding , a price rise may continue unabated . The fundamental difference between the two situations is that in the excess demand situation prices rise inevitably ; the rise can be halted , or reduced , by monetary and fiscal measures that reduce aggregate real demand . But when demand is below the supply potential there is no necessary downward pull on prices ; the gap between potential supply and demand may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasions , by a fall in production and employment . Consequently , in this situation , monetary and fiscal policies may not , and usually do not , have the remedial effect that they have in the converse situation . And they may have a perverse effect . If , on the overall average , the production of goods and services is subject to increasing returns to scale , monetary and fiscal policies designed to reduce demand will raise costs . In this area prices asked depend on costs , so that a reduction of aggregate demand is // likely to compel the suppliers of goods and services to raise prices . Per contra , expansionist monetary and fiscal policies would enable them to reduce prices . A reduction of prices sounds a little unrealistic in relation to recent events , save for exceptional cases like the reduction of air fares . But , if a wage push is proceeding , a rise of demand may make it possible for firms to absorb a greater part of the higher wages by a reduction of unit costs than they otherwise could . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate of price inflation . If , in these circumstances , the authorities use monetary and fiscal policies to curtail aggregate demand , this will have the malign effect of increasing price inflation . It is argued that a reduction of aggregate demand , even when that is below the supply potential of the economy , should reduce price inflation by causing an abatement of the wage push , on the lines of the Phillips curve , for which experience in the U.K. does not in fact provide evidence . Two points must be made . Even if rising unemployment caused an abatement of the rate of wage increases , this might well reduce money costs less than the fall of turnover increased real unit costs . In this case deflation , so called , would have a price-inflationary effect . The second point is that it need not be denied , that , if deflationary monetary and fiscal policies were carried to the point of producing really massive unemployment , like that of 1931 , this might have a damping effect on the request for the granting of higher wages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buckle to , and do his best in such circumstances ; wage claims will be abated . But the creation of such massive unemployment as that required to produce a crisis atmosphere ' should not be regarded as part of the normal machinery of monetary and fiscal policies in the present age . A step forward was taken in the Second World War in relation to the targets of policy ; it was decided that massive unemployment such as that of the thirties should not be allowed to recur , and could be prevented . We do not want to go back on that , nor shall . The upshot is that a new weapon of policy is required , an incomes policy ' . Inflation is an evil . It may be due to aggregate demand being currently in excess of the supply potential of the economy . This possibility was implicitly recognised by writers on the business // cycle from the beginning ; but it was first introduced into the corpus of basic formal economy theory by Keynes . He did not dilate on its consequences for economic policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work in general theory , the world was plagued by a deficiency of aggregate demand and he addressed his constructive proposals mainly to that phase . He did , however , make practical suggestions in relation to excessive demand in the Second World War in his pamphlet on How to pay for the war ' There is no problem here . The remedy is to reduce aggregate demand by monetary and fiscal policies ? reduce the money supply and increase the ratio of taxation to governmental expenditure . If aggregate demand is running below the supply potential , so that there is underemployment of those at work and/or visible unemployment in addition to that due to regular frictional causes , the opposite remedies are appropriate ? increase the money supply and reduce the ratio of taxation to governmental expenditure . This is quite independent of whether inflation is simultaneously proceeding . Unemployment and inflation are both evils ; the former is the greater evil . It entails that persons who want to work can not find jobs , which must be a source of distress to them , and that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services that could add to its happiness . Inflation causes many tiresome inconveniences and also important suffering to those with fixed incomes . A conscientious government could remedy the latter evil by the provision of compensatory allowances for the victims ; but it would do better to stop the inflation . If depressing demand , when it is already below the supply potential , is ruled out , no remedy has been advanced except an incomes policy ' , namely an arrangement by which on the overall average earnings do not go up by more than the overall average increase in productivity , and prices are accordingly held stable . This arrangement might be secured by continuing round-table negotiations . If that , after fair trial , proves impossible , resort must be had to legal enforcement . It is objected that the equitable administration of such a law would need a bureaucracy of substantial size . That would be regrettable . But it is rather a perverse objection in an age when vast bureaucracies are being built up on all sides to achieve much less important objectives . // Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be allowed to go up somewhat more than output per head , in order to secure a more equitable distribution of the national income . It is to be noted that salary earners , including those in upper income brackets , are in the inflation race and sometimes seem to be winning . There is a technical difficulty here . In a regime of stable prices earnings could be allowed to go up over a continuing period only by a small fraction of i per cent p.a. in excess of productivity , if profits were not to be eliminated altogether and the system of private enterprise terminated . To get a precise very small amount of increase of overall average earnings in excess of productivity would be a matter of great statistical and administrative difficulty . There may be errors in getting the overall average increase of earnings exactly equal to that of productivity . But this is a manageable target , and there can be ex post adjustments . It is generally agreed that a redistribution of incomes , if and when required to secure greater equity , should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finally , there is the question of the Harrod dichotomy ' . It has been widely held that measures to increase real aggregate demand will always have a price inflationary effect . According to the dichotomy ' such measures will have a price inflationary effect , only when real aggregate demand is currently running above , or at , or , perhaps one should cautiously add , almost at , the supply potential of the economy . If , on the other hand , it is running below the supply potential , expansionist measures will tend to reduce real costs and thereby raise productivity . Thus the increase of earnings allowable by the productivity criterion will be greater with an expansionist policy than it would otherwise be . Consequently an expansionist policy would ease the headaches of those who have to settle earning rates , whether at voluntary round-tables or in statutory committees . The statements ( already referred to ) of Mr Barber and President Nixon imply that an expansionist policy will help , not hinder , the fight against inflation . I know of no official statements in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are followed up by effective action , they could be a turning point in the history of economic policy .
