txt Life did not have to return to normal for farmer David Lapp , whose silos and fields are just 20 miles from the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant . He did not worry about a possible cutoff of electricity or talk of radiation in the air . He does not even use electricity . Instead , he and his family light their home by kerosene lamps , do their cooking by gas , and their washing by hand . The Lapps are Amish , a fiercely independent conservative Christian people , many of whom live in the rolling farmland of south-central Pennsylvania . While Mr. Lapp says he is as concerned as anyone else about the safety of people in the immediate vicinity of Three Mile Island , the incident merely re-establisheshis firm belief that people should not be dependent on electricity . Mr. Lapp 's neighbor , Luke Martin , is much more outspoken in his views on the nuclear accident . He says it is a reminder to people that " we 're supposed to be stewards of the Earth . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and religious group to which most Amish belong . He also lives simply and frugally but does use electricity . Last year he and his family installed solar collectors for use in heating their home and greenhouse , which sit on 51/2 acres of land . And he wants to install a windmill soon , as Mr. Lapp has done . " All this stuff , " continues Mr. Martin , " is something we 're going to see a lot more of . That nuclear power , if it was n't for the big utility companies , it would n't be there now . " // From page 1 Amish : ' untouched ' Mr. Martin thinks he can recoup his investment in his homemade solar heater in four or five years " at the most : It 's going to be much more economical than electricity or fuel oil . " His solar gear is composed of 70 , 55-gallon water drums to hold heat collected from the sun by glass and plastic panels . Joseph Horning , another local Mennonite. said he was " glad that the electricity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to something like nuclear power to supply electricity , I do not blame them for it . " He , his wife , Mabel , and two young children do use electricity , but since he does not read newspapers and refuses to buy a radio or television , he said he had only heard " just a few words " about Three Mile Island . Mr. Horning and this reporter talked in an aluminum barn that was heated by a homemade coal burner . Isaac Lapp , Mr. Lapp 's son , said he " just did n't give much thought about the nuclear safety problem . " The overwhelming majority of Amish have never turned to the use of electricity , and because of this incident , he thought , they would be more reluctant than ever to do so . " We seem to be getting along pretty well as we are , " the younger Lapp said . " We have a coal-heating stove and a gas range to do cooking . " But he admitted with a smile that he had gone to see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car . The only vehicle his family owns is a horse-drawn bug ' . Unlike his father , Isaac Lapp was concerned about the possibility of radioactive fallout from the disabled nuclear plant . The Lapp family farm lies just outside the 20-mile radius that was monitored for radiation contamination in milk . Gov . Richard Thornburgh said April 3 that small amounts of radiation were found in this vicinity of the plant but did not constitute a health problem .
