George Kennan has always been fascinated by the Soviet Union , which Winston Churchill characterized as " a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma . " A former U.S. Ambassador to Moscow and fellow at Princeton 's Institute for Advanced Study , Kennan , 72 , is now engaged in his most ambitious effort to solve that riddle . With Princeton Colleagues James Billington and Frederick Starr , he has set up the first major center for Russian studies to open in the U.S. in more than a decade . <P> Located in the Smithsonian Institution 's Victorian-Gothic headquarters building and affiliated with the Woodrow Wilson Center for Scholars , the new Kennan Institute will bring experts from round the world to Washington for all-expense-paid weekend seminars , short-term research projects and yearlong fellowships .

It can serve as an anchor in bad times and a channel for improved communications in good times . " <P> Company Money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellowship program , slated to begin this fall . Among the proposals : studies of Soviet society under Stalin , Russian nationalism , Soviet biological research and 19th century Russian ideology . <P> The institute is already sponsoring a full schedule of conferences on Soviet history , politics and culture .

Money was drying up ; resources and facilities were scattered . Many leaders in the field were dead . It was felt that if I did n't do something , nobody else would . " So as not to drain foundation money from existing university centers* for Soviet studies , Kennan approached companies that do business with the Russians , including PepsiCo , Chase Manhattan , Bank of America and General Electric . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also impressed . Says one : " We do not have entirely fond memories of Ambassador Kennan himself the Kremlin declared him persona non grata after he denounced Stalinism in 1953 , but we regard the formation of his institute as a positive development .
