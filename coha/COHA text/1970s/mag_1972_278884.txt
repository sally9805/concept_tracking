The accomplishments of bureaucracy affect individuals in wondrous ways - and nowhere more so than in Japan . Consider the case of Herbert Freidman , an American businessman living in Japan . One day last month , he climbed aboard a plane at Tokyo airport and flew off to Okinawa , dutifully surrendering to a customs agent the alien-registration card he carries . His passport was stamped to show that Freidman was leaving the country . According to procedure , his passport would be stamped again when he returned to Tokyo , and he would be issued a new alien-registration card . <P> The only problem was that during the week that Freidman spent on Okinawa , that island reverted from U.S. occupation to Japanese possession . Thus it was a domestic flight on which he returned to Tokyo . Since he was merely traveling from one Japanese island to another , no customs man would stamp his passport , and since his passport was not marked , no one would issue him a new alien-registration card . <P> Freidman as a result is caught in a bureaucratic mesh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to travel because his passport is not in order . He thought at first of solving the impasse by flying to a nearby country and coming back into Japan officially . But , of course , since there is no record that he is in Japan , there is no way that his passport can be stamped to allow him out .
