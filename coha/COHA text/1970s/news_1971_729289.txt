txt Soecial to Me New York Time , FORVBENNING , Ga. , March 10 ? With a hard , unblinking stare at his subordinate , Capt , 1Ernest L. Medina testified today that he had never given First Lieut .. William L. Caney Jr . orders to kill women and children at Mylai . He quoted Lieutenant Calley as saying : " My God , I can still hear the screaming , " when , two days after the alleged massacre of civilians at the South Vietnamese hamlet , he asked his platoon leaders if any " atrocities " had been committed . This was stricken from the record by the military judge at Lieutenant Calley 's courtmartial on a defense objection that an alleged " confession " extracted in this manner without prior warning was inadmissible . Captain Medina 's testimony today contradicted testimony given-by LieUtenant Calley that he had been carrying out Captain Medina 's orders at Mylai . Captain Medina , who is 34 years old , looked at Lieutenant Calley and said he told his company on the eve of the atContinued tack : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You use common sense . If they have a weapon and they are trying to engage you , then you can shoot back , but you must use common sense . " Under cross-examination this evening by George W. Latimer , defense counsel , Captain Medina admitted trying to cover up the incident . He gave four reasons , saying first that what happened at Mylai was " a disgrace upon the Army uniform I am very proud to wear . " He continued : " No. 2 , I also realized the repercussions it would have against the United States of America . " No. 3 , my family . And No. 4 , lastly , myself , sir . " Lieutenant Calley has been charged with the premeditated murder of at least 102 civilians at Mylai 4 on March 16 , 1968 . His court-martial , which began last November , is nearly over , and the jury of six officers may get the case next week . No date has been set for the court-martial of Captain Medina , who is charged with killing two persons at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsible for the killings allegedly committed by his men . Captain Medina , like Lieutenant Calley , had been charged with the premeditated murder of at least 102 civilians , but the Army today announced that the charge had been moderated . The confrontation between the two officers in the tense and crowded little courtroom had been eagerly awaited . Lieutenant Calley , while asserting that he admired Captain Medina , had depicted the company commander as a man who not only ordered the slaughter of unarmed civilians but had also told his officers to use civilians as human mine detectors , forcing civilians to precede the troops across mine fields . Under cross-examination , Captain Medina admitted telling Lieutenant Calley that he could " utilize prisoners to help lead his unit through the mine field . " ' Innocent Civilians ' But he maintained that at no time had he suggested that " innocent civilians " be killed . On the contrary , he said , he had twice cautioned his platoon leaders during the action to avoid indiscriminate shooting . Captain Medina conceded that he had shot a Vietnamese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rice paddy he thought she was reaching for a weapon . He denied another allegation that he had slain a wounded little boy who came running down the trail . But he said he was so confused he might have ordered the shooting . " There was a small boy that started moving from the edge of the woodline , " he said . " I caught the movement , I turned and started to raise my rifle , I seen that it was a child . I started to put it down . And I either uttered the words : ' Get him , get him ' ; ' stop him , stop him ' or ' do n't shoot ' or ' shoot . ' " He said he was disturbed by these incidents . " When the child was shot , I became very emotional , " he said . " I felt very bad about this and I grabbed the radio and I says : " Make sure you inform all your personnel that they do n't shoot innocent civilians ! : Order Against Shooting His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in answer to a question posed by one of his soldiers at a briefing on the eve of Mylai . The question was : " Do we kill women and children , " Captain Medina said . " My reply to that question was : ' No , you do not kill women and children . You must use common sense . " He said he was asked another question : Should they poison the wells ? " I told them we did not have any poison available , and that this was not the thing to do , " he said . " The thing to do , " he went on , was to seal the well by caving in the sides with explosives . If that did n't work , they should dump banana stalks and other vegetation into the well and choke it , he , said . Captain Medina said he began to worry about civilian casualties soon after the assault on Mylai began . He said he started cautioning Lieutenant Calley even before the helicopter pilots began reporting piles of corpses in a ditch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received an order from the operations officer of Task Force Barker to go back into the hamlet and get an exact count of the civilian dead , he proItested . While arguing with the operations officer , Maj. Gen. Samuel W. Koster , commanding the parent Amerioal Division , had cut in , using the code name Saber Six . General Koster countermanded the order after asking Captain Medina how many civilians had been killed . Captain Medina said he replied " 20 to 28 " where upon General Koster told the operations officer : " That sounds about right Do n't send him back in there . " Captain Medina was appearing as a court witness . His testimony had been requested by a member of the court . He was accompanied by several lawyers beaded by F. Lee Bailey . As he entered the courtroom , Captain Medina exchanged nods with Lieutenant Calley , adding a terse , " Hello , how are you .
