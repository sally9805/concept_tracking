Persistently , almost rhythmically , the prosecutor repeated the question . Soon , everyone in the courtroom , including the pained witness , could anticipate it . For some , the impulse to join in the refrain was difficult to resist . In his deceptively soft Tennessee drawl , Chief Prosecutor James Neal would ask : " Now , you wanted to get the truth out , Mr. Ehrlichman ? " That has been Defendant John Ehrlichman 's claim in the Watergate conspiracy trial . But with searing effect , Neal shredded that defense by repeatedly showing how much Ehrlichman had known about the cover-up and how little he had disclosed to investigators . <P> It had long seemed obvious that it would have been suicidal for such articulate and once influential men as the five defendants to fail to testify in their own defense . Yet Ehrlichman discovered last week , as had the hapless John Mitchell and H.R. Haldeman before him , that exposure to the prosecution 's cross-examination was equally hazardous . Unlike Mitchell , who stubbornly denied his own participation in the coverup , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there ever was such a conspiracy , Ehrlichman 's strategy , in effect , was to contend that he had been " deceived " by former President Nixon into taking part , and had no criminal intent of his own . <P> Ehrlichman survived his ordeal in slightly better shape than had either Mitchell or Haldeman , mainly because he did not try to evade the implications of Nixon 's taped words . He conceded that Nixon had wanted him to prepare a report on Watergate that was " less than the truth , " and had asked him to take on other " improper " tasks . As for tapes that also incriminated Ehrlichman , he had ingenuous explanations . When he said " uh hum " or " yeah , yeah " to Nixon on the tapes , for example , he was " fending " Nixon off about cover-up acts , not expressing agreement . Moreover , he claimed that he had held exonerating conversations with Nixon that were not recorded , such as while they " walked to the barbershop . " <P> Very Painful . Ehrlichman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although Ehrlichman may have elicited some sympathy from the jury earlier in an emotional recitation of his final days in the Nixon Administration . On questioning by his lawyer , William Prates , Ehrlichman recalled being summoned to Camp David on the afternoon of April 29 , 1973 . There , on a cabin porch , Nixon told him he must resign . Ehrlichman said Nixon found this chore " very painful " and even " broke down at one point and cried . " Nixon offered him money for legal fees and " anything else he could do for me . " All Ehrlichman wanted , he testified , was for Nixon some day " to explain to our children " why he had to resign . <P> At that point , the husky Ehrlichman 's voice choked . He began to weep . " Excuse me , " he said , sipping water from a cup . " Would you like a little recess ? " gently asked Federal Judge John J. Sirica . Ehrlichman tried to continue , but Sirica raised both hands to stop him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the judge 's exit until directed by Prates to a side door . Ehrlichman 's wife Jeanne sat stoically in a second-row seat , her eyes not meeting her husband 's . None of their five children were present .
