WHETHER or not American politics makes strange bedfellows , it assuredly is making for active , absent ones in election year 1972 . Last spring , George McGovern was flying over the Eastern seaboard in a private airplane , headed for a primary campaign stop , when a companion recognized another craft off the wing . " George , " he advised , " get to the window . This may be your only chance to see Eleanor the rest of this campaign . " <P> That was only a slight exaggeration . <P> Since January , Eleanor McGovern has covered more ground and logged more flying hours than any other presidential candidate 's wife in memory . Almost as if a white kid glove had been thrown at her feet , Pat Nixon seems to have risen to Eleanor 's challenge . In the 1968 campaign , Pat left her husband 's entourage only once-for a quick ribbon-cutting ceremony in Reno . This year , uncharacteristically stepping out from the President 's shadow , the First Lady undertook the most extended solo campaign trip of her long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states and exposed her to rough weather and even rougher questioning . Never before in the history of U.S. politics have the wives of two presidential candidates squared off so directly . <P> Both of the wives bring to their campaigning a remarkably similar poise and professionalism , to say nothing of chic good looks that are the envy of their contemporaries in the crowds that turn out to greet them ( Pat is 60 , Eleanor 50 ) . They project a warmth that reaches their listeners in a way that their spouses manage only rarely . The rest is a study in contrasting styles . Eleanor , often in pantsuits , looks like the petite , bubbly cheerleader she once was back in high school in Woonsocket , S. Dak . Pat , slim and regally straight-backed , has only once appeared on the hustings in slacks . She seems in photographs to be aloof , brittle , a shade too manicured and coiffed to be quite real or approachable . <P> In fact , as the voters are constantly rediscovering , both appearances are somewhat deceiving . Pat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , brimming with a zest for meeting people . She tackles a crowd of strangers like a bee that has spotted a new clover field . She does not simply shake a hand , she cuddles it in both of hers . She hugs , touches , pats , squeezes . She scoops up small children with easy endearments like " Dolly , " or " Sweetheart . " She almost never makes formal speeches , nor does she directly praise her husband . " I ca n't boast for my family , " she explains . <P> Pat 's long suit is small talk , the simple , spontaneous gesture . On a visit to the Oklahoma State Fair , she took cotton candy , stroked a prize Hereford on the head and rode the merry-go-round , saying , " This is part of the American spirit-you do n't need much to be happy . " Is she happy ? someone dared ask the First Lady . " Yes , I am . I 've got the greatest guy in the world . " Presented with a sunbonnet , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to Washington , ex plaining whimsically : " I think this is the real me . I could really be a pioneer . " In a sense she is , and while sophisticates may dismiss such doings as cornpone , the crowds love it .
