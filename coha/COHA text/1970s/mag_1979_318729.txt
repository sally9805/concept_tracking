In North Carolina : The Strange Case of " Dr. Dunk " <P> If the used-car dealer in Washington , N.C. , had n't got rid of that red and white 1978 Chrysler Newport so fast , it would have been easier for the big-city reporter to unravel the mystery that is still swirling around this little town . Because if the reporter had been able to examine the Chrysler , he might have found tell-tale traces of paint . And according to Gertrude Baker , the paint happened to be there because an outraged neighbor splattered it on the car after Dominique Wilkins , her son by an earlier marriage , decided to enroll in the University of Georgia last spring . <P> Why should anyone be moved to anger by the educational plans of a 19-year-old black kid from a small town on the sandy banks of the Pamlico River ? Because North Carolina is basketball country , that 's why . It is a state where few issues besides tobacco prices and Joe Califano 's antismoking campaign can generate as much passionate controversy as basketball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Washington ( pop . 9,000 ) , young men like Dominique Wilkins tend to be regarded as state monuments . Dominique is 6 ft. 7 in. tall . He can hang in the air like a bat and do things with a basketball that Dr. James Naismith , who invented the game , never contemplated . Like slam it through the basket from all sorts of odd angles , with such style that by the time he was a high school junior , sportswriters were already calling him " Dr. Dunk . " Led by Dominique , the Washington High School Pam Pack won back-to-back state Triple-A league championships and built up a 56-game winning streak , then the longest in the nation . In his senior year , Dominique averaged nearly 30 points and 16 rebounds a game . He was named to Parade ' s high school All-America team . <P> By last spring Dr. Dunk 's achievements had made him one of the most sought-after high school players in the U.S. More than 200 colleges were hoping to snag him . Dozens of coaches or their representatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to watch Dominique do his stuff . Naturally , North Carolina State , a perennial basketball power , was interested . Concedes its athletic director , Willis Casey : " We wanted him in the worst way . " David Thompson , a former N.C. State forward who is now one of the highest paid players in the National Basketball Association , sent Dominique a personal , written-by-hand letter . The school gave him free tickets to its home games . And when that snazzy red and white Chrysler showed up in the driveway outside his mother 's modest apartment in the Runyon Creek public housing project , everyone assumed that it was the clincher in N.C. State 's sign up Dr. Dunk campaign . After all , she was n't working . How could she afford an expensive car like that ? Besides , were n't red and white the Wolfpack colors ?
