MADAME , AN INTIMATE BIOGRAPHY OF HELENA RUBINSTEIN by Patrick O'Higgins. 296 pages . Viking . $7.95 . <P> If no man is a hero to his valet , per-haps no woman can be a heroine to her secretary . That , at least , might be one lesson to be derived from this colorful , bitchy , bizarre biography of the late Helena Rubinstein , written by the rather unctuous Irishman who served as her factotum for nearly 14 years . <P> Born in Cracow , Poland , " Madame " founded her empire in Australia in the early 1900s by successfully marketing a version of her mother 's home-brewed recipe for face cream . When O'Higgins first saw her in 1950-plowing down Madison Avenue , a crocodile bag in one hand and a brown-paper lunch bag in the other-she was the undisputed queen of the beauty industry ; he was travel editor of Fleur Cowles ' peekaboo fashion magazine , Flair . Sometime later , after an introduction by mutual friends , he was invited to become her personal secretary . His salary was modest ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long time he just sat in her office , witnessing conversations and opening and closing doors . But by the time she died in 1965 , at the age of 94 , O'Higgins had become , by his description , almost a foster son . <P> Madame was , of course , a great businesswoman , with an intuitive sense of what products would sell and an eccentric genius for publicity . She ruled her company much the way that Catherine the Great ruled Russia-through nepotism and terror-and openly played one faction of the huge family she kept employed against another . " Go tell my nephew , what's-his-name , that he 's a rotten vice-president , " she once ordered her secretary . " They all want to prove their worth , " she complained to O'Higgins , " but they all want to enjoy their own lives . People . . . people . . . and I 'm alone ! With burdens . .. such burdens !

Still , if Madame was a monster , she could be an endearing one , a cross between Auntie Mame and J.P . Morgan . She was , as O'Higgins points out , both earthy and plain-spoken to friends in high places and low . Her main problem seems to have been in dealing with those close to her , and except on rare , touching occasions , she could or would not allow true emotion to penetrate her granite mask . <P> O'Higgins is a B-grade writer with a weakness for overstretched metaphor : " Her dentures clattered like castanets on crusts of French bread , " for example , or " popping back on her feet like a piece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine ear for dialogue and a relish for tattletales that make Madame entertaining bathtub reading .
