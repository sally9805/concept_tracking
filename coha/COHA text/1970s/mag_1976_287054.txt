What do Truman Capote , Alexander Solzhenitsyn and Barbara Hutton have in common ? Answer : things have been working out fine for them . Sort of . Writer Capote , now finishing his high-society novel Answered Prayers , did n't have a prayer in a Southampton , L.I. , court last week , when he pleaded guilty to a drunken-driving charge . He was fined $165 and ordered to enroll in a state-run driver-rehabilitation program . Nobel Prizewinning Author Solzhenitsyn and Wife Natalya have learned Western ways too fast . She was at the wheel of their van when a Kansas highway patrolman pulled her over for doing 76 in a 55-m.p.h. zone . But no jail awaited Natalya or the startled author of The Gulag Archipelago . Instead , they received a brisk lecture on traffic customs , U.S. style , and a $25 fine . Hit hardest was Woolworth Heiress Barbara Hutton , who was assessed $800 in Mexico last week after she failed for the past two months to pay the wages ( a total of $640 per week ) of the 20 gardeners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she just forgot : she is never there . <P> <P> " To act this way is a refreshing and salutary experience , " says Yves Montand . No wonder . Of late , he has been assassinated in Z , tortured in The Confession and kidnaped and murdered in State of Siege , but in the comedy he is now filming in Italy , Le Grand Esco-griffe ( an exuberant man too clever for his own good ) , Montand is permitted the luxury of survival . " This comedy is sublime , " he says . Ridiculous , too : the hopelessly ill-fated kidnaper-star ends up stuck with the kidnapee . <P> Should she be troubled by a pea under her mattress-like the sensitive maiden in the fairy tale-Princess Anne of England , 25 , will probably have to remove it herself , at least while she resides in the Olympic Village at Bromont , Quebec , 45 miles from Montreal . As one of the 21 members of Britain 's equestrian team , Anne requested that she receive no special treatment , and she is n't getting any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ athletes , including her husband , Captain Mark Phillips , an alternate member of the team ; she stands on line for meals in the cafeteria ; she rides in the bumpy shuttle bus from the village to the stables two miles away . All security is so tight at the Games that Anne 's presence has required no additional measures . Says one equestrian official : " You can hardly breathe for the armed guards . Anne could invite Queen Elizabeth to stay overnight and we would n't have to increase the security . " Like it or not , the princess still gets some uncommon attention . Confesses a village authority : " The first time I saw her having breakfast in the cafeteria , I whirled around so fast I nearly dumped my tray all over the Australians . " <P>
