The big story today in the ongoing controversy over nuclear power is money . Skyrdcketing and perhaps pro  --  hibitive costs may eventually cripple , the attempt to raise the nation 's dependency upon atomic energy . Meanwhile , it is apparent , electric ratepayers and perhaps the Amer  --  ican taxpayer will be called upon to subsidize the coun  --  try 's multibillion-dollar nuclear experiment . This emerging trend , reported with increasing urgency from one end of the country to the other , erupted last month during four days of hearings in the Midvirest . The Federal Energy Administration ( FEA ) has been sponsor  --  ing these hearings around the country under the ? grand title , Project Independence . The idea , dear to ex-President Nixon , is to make the United States self-sufficient in en  --  ergy by 1980 . Although a great many topics were on the agenda for the four-day affair , including the conservation of energy and exploring new or untapped sources of power , it was apparent from the start that nuclear power  --  which now supplies 4 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  vocates hoping to increase this output to 60 per cent or more by the year 2000 ? would dominate the proceedings at Chicago 's Conrad Hilton Hotel . , John C. Sawhill , the FEA chief , made a move to set the course of the meeting in his welcoming address by declaring , " We 're here- today to discuss nuclear energy because of the potential it has to become a major energy source- of the nation . " He ' then went on'to contend that " the weight of the evi  --  dence suggests that nuclear power is among the safest sources of energy we have on hand today . " As expected , any number of anti-nuclear spokesmen , representing con  --  servation , scientific , consumer and environmental groups , were on hand to argue that very point with the likes of Sawhill . But ' the hint of revelatory things to come emerged from Sawhill 's passing reference to the fact that " con  --  struction costs " of atomic power plants " are high , " and that " the nuclear industry needs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been a major problem at new plants . " This set the stage for the dramatic entrance of David Dinsmore Comey , the establishment-bred. environ  --  mental director of the Chicago-based Businessmen for the Public Interest . A persistent , informed critic and a formi  --  dable thorn in the side of the nuclear proponents , the 39 ? year-old Comey took the floor to insist that atomic power plants are highly . inefficient producers of electricity , and that , as a i-esult , they have ' wasted and will continue to waste billions of dollars . No one present was able ef  --  fectively to refute his charges . Comey 's blast was a highly embarrassing , potentially damaging attack upon the nuclear industry , which has been claiming that atomic power is safe , clean , efficient and cheap . Using Atomic Energy Commission studies and figures , he reported that nuclear power plants on the average have been producing electricity at only 54 per cent of their capacity . And the longer they operate , ac  --  cording to AEC figures and to Comey , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of plants seven years old and older is down to 38 per cent . Figures pointing in this direction are not brand new , but , Conley put them to interesting and effective use . Basing his projections on the plants in operation ( but dis- , countmg the older , smaller ones ) , along with those that have been ordered and actively planned , Comey contends that the gap between the maximum capacity to produce and actual output could add $121 billion to the nation 's power bill by 1990 , if the plants generate at 54 per cent of capacity , and more than $198 billion , if they produce at only 38 per cent . Mentioning figures of this magnitude touches another sore point for the nuclear establishment  --  its increasing struggle to obtain enough money to finance the building of new billion-dollar nuclear installations . " The annual requirements for new capital for the entire electric utility industry have recently bounced from $5 billion to roughly $10 billion , " Comey ' said , " and the industry is having grave difficulties raising even these sums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be receptive to cost overruns of the magnitude de  --  scribed above . Since only the U.S. Government is likely to be available for these capital requirements , it may very well be that the names of General Electric , Westing  --  house , Combustion Engineering , Babcock and Wilcox , Consolidated Edison , Consumers Power and others will join Lockheed , Boeing and Grumman on the rolls of corporations bailed out of costly technological misadven  --  tures by the taxpayers . " Prior to Comey 's appearance , members of the nu  --  clear establishment  --  among them Thomas G. Ayers , chairman and president of Commonwealth Edison Co. , , the nation 's largest nuclear utility  --  were announcing all the Project Independence hearings that nuclear plants were both reliable and highly efficient . They have been given to explaining that it takes three to four years to work ' out the kinks in new atomic plants , but contend that after that they operate at 80 per cent of capacity , compared to about 65 per cent for fossil-fueled plants  --  which are much cheaper to build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peak after three or four years , then hammered away with his figures to argue that it 's all downhill from then on . One reason why atomic power plants do n't operate at full capacity is that the authorities believe the likelihood of catastrophic accidents would increase if they did . An  --  other is the fact that nuclear plant 's are subject to break  --  downs and repairs  --  often long and unusually expensive . For example , because of radiation hazards , it took seven months , 700 men and $1 million to repair part of a cool  --  ing pipe at Consolidated Edison 's Indian Point plant on the Hudson River . Comey puts it this way : " Corrosion problems set in , leaking fuel becomes a problem , and system components break down due to fatigue and other wear-related prob  --  lems . An additional hazard is the accumulation of highly radioactive , crud in the Primary , system , which means that any repair work on this system will consume enormous amounts of time and personnel in order to avoid excessive radiation exposure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to participate in the repair of a single plant , and a worker can receive his maximum permissible ex  --  posure after working on the primary system for less than sixty seconds , thus ' burning him out ' for the next three months . " More , as a result of the Project Independence hearings in Chicago , it is apparent not only that construction and operating costs related to nuclear power may reach in  --  surmountable heights for ratepayers and ultimately tax  --  payers to accept but , also , that the issue of nuclear safety and its direct tie-in to atomic plant " reliability  --  and hence efficiency  --  will probably dominate the next round in the steamed-up battle between the pro- and anti-nuclear forces . In the first regard , William R. Gould , chairman of the Atomic Industrial Forum , Inc. , struck a recurring theme at the hearings when he reported that " the most serious problem now facing the nuclear industry .. . is simply the inability of the utility industry to finance the capital Predicting that the industry 's " new money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by 1980 , Gould in  --  sisted that " it is quite clear that prompt and adequate rate relief is the step that would do the most good in the shortest time . " John Quale , president of Wisconsin Electric Power Co. , also referred to the " present financial woes of this capital intensive industry , " and voiced at the Project In  --  dependence hearings another utility plea for " timely rate relief .. . . Customers will have to recognize that the future costs of electric service will be substantially higher . " Wisconsin Electric Power is the leading figure in a joint billion utility venture to build twin 900-megawatt nuclear power reactors , on the shores of Lake Kosh  --  konong , about 30 miles southeast of Madison , the state capital . Wisconsin Power and Light is another utility poking around for more money . The company recently asked the Wisconsin Public Service Commission for a rate hike after obtaining state PSC permission to sell 1.5 million shares of common stock , in part to finance the proposed Lake Koshkonong atomic power plants . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stiff opposition which could have far-reaching national implications . Chicago attorney Myron ( Mike ) Cherry , representing a coalition of grass-roots anti-nuclear forces that has at  --  tracted the support of Friends of the Earth and Ralph Nader 's organization , has pushed the high cost of nuclear power center-stage in his current fight against the Kosh  --  konong plants . " , The average economics of the national nuclear indus  --  try across the nation has been quite poor , " , Cherry con  --  tends . " It costs double what it was supposed to cost . We should make sure the consumers  --  the ratepayers  --  do not pay for it if it turns out to be uneconomical . " The utilities have asked the Wigconsin Public Service Commission for permission to go ahead with their Lake Koshkonong project , The 35-year-old Cherry , who has dominated the current PSC hearings , is trying to persuade the state agency to turn down the application . He has managed to wrestle unprecedented concessions - thus far from the PSC by hammering upon the commission 's , man  --  date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able rates . Cherry argues that " a power plant 's safety is- a function of its reliability , and if a nuclear power plant has an accident . . . that 's a factor in its operating costs , over and above the dangers of radioactivity . " To buttress his point , he cites AEC figures showing that the average operating level of large nuclear plants across the country for the first six months of 1974 was only 52.3 per cent of their total generating capacity . The economic arguments against nuclear fission power advanced by people like Comey and Cherry could be precedent-setting . Heretofore , the courts have held that only the AEC has the right to rule on matters of nuclear safety . Now , by tying the safety issue of nuclear power to its reliability and cost , the decision on whether or not to build individual nuclear power plants may be wrested away from the friendly hands of the AEC and returned to ' the public arena of state and local government pro  --  ceedings . Comey ' , and Cherry have teamed up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the nuclear establishment to improve atomic plant safety . This time , their separate economic attacks may throw the door open to an entirely new aspect , of the nuclear controversy . Comey may have had good reason to feel optimistic when he said , at the Project Independence hearings in Chicago , " Mr. Sawhill 's enthusiasm for nuclear power needs to be reconsidered . " PAUL TAYLOR THE POWER OF A TENACIOUS MAN MARY ELLEN LEARY Berkeley Dr. Paul Schuster Taylor is a phenomenon among acade- , micians . Some think that what makes this University of California economist remarkable is the faith he has sus  --  tained in the small family farm in the irrigated West , despite the national decline of home-centered farming and despite the increasingly corporate pattern that converts , agriculture into industry . 11 They are wrong . The size of a landholding is not the essence of the stubborn crusade Dr. Taylor has been carrying forward . True , he has been talking with singu  --  lar concentration about 160-acre farms in reclamation districts . But what he has really focused upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bureaus that administer the law . For thirty years this modest , . gentle  --  manly scholar has been admonishing the public about a governmental flouting of the law which he considers as ' serious an abuse as Watergate . With the U.S. public alerted these days to the con  --  sequences of governmental distortion of the law for spe  --  cial , private advantage , Dr. Taylor 's alarms over land monopoly are enjoying a more hospitable reception than they used to get . He has been heard and heeded in Con  --  gressional circles in past crises . He has been published in acadeMic journals and cited by the U.S. Supreme Court . But there are signs now that many of the politically alert among the general public have caught his concern for the National Reclamation Act , which was meant to pre  --  vent , or break up , vast corporate landholdings in areas , of the West where government subsidy has made water available . Taylor 's effort to keep alive the early Amer  --  ican reverence for that finite resource , land , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the concern of present-day environmentalists .
