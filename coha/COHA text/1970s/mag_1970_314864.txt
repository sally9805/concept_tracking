BARRING a last-minute hitch , a special train will speed eastward from Bonn one night this week on what could prove to be the most historic journey in postwar German history . The express will halt briefly at the small town of Gerstungen on the border between West and East Germany . There an East German engine and crew will take over to pull the train the remaining 40 miles to the ancient city of Erfurt . The next morning , when West German Chancellor Willy Brandt steps from his sleeping car at the Erfurt station , he will be greeted by Willi Stoph , the Premier of the German Democratic Republic . <P> For the first time since the two rival states were founded in 1949 , the heads of government of the two Germanys will meet face to face . They will talk until evening , probably in the Erfurter Hof , a hotel near the station . <P> Minimum of Pomp . It is unlikely that a single meeting will produce a sensational breakthrough in the tense and frigid relations between the two German states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being held at all . Only last week , the East Germans seemed ready to torpedo the Willy-Willi meeting by insisting on impossible demands , most notably that Brandt travel to East Berlin without setting foot in West Berlin , the city he served as mayor for almost a decade . Refusing to take nein for an answer , Brandt suggested a meeting in any other city . To Bonn 's amazement , the East German regime proposed Erfurt as the site . <P> In addition , the East Germans reversed their earlier demands and agreed to a minimum of pomp . Brandt will not be required to inspect an East German honor guard or to listen to the playing of the two national anthems . Perhaps most important of all , the East Germans accepted Bonn 's proposal for a second summit , to be held after Erfurt somewhere in West Germany . <P> Sudden Switch . The crucial factor in East Germany 's sudden switch was in all likelihood the influence of the Soviets , who are also engaged in negotiations with Bonn . Concerned that a deadlock between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Soviets apparently prevailed upon East German Party Boss Walter Ulbricht to give his go-ahead to the Brandt-Stoph summit . When the meeting was finally scheduled , the Soviet embassy in Bonn issued a terse statement that left no doubt about Moscow 's attitude . Said the Russians : " We welcome it . " <P> The East Germans want West Germany to grant them full diplomatic recognition so that their part of Germany may take its place as a full-fledged sovereign nation in the world community . Brandt is willing to grant de jure recognition to East Germany-but with two important reservations . In accord with his formula of two German " states " within one " nation , " he maintains that the Federal Republic will never regard the German Democratic Republic as a foreign country . He also holds that Germans of both countries will always share a common citizenship . Moreover , before he will consider granting diplomatic recognition to East Germany , Brandt insists that progress be made in normalizing relations between the two states in such areas as travel , communications and cultural contacts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
