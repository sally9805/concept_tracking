 | unpredictable . " Now do n't you be gettin ' your mad up , Frank . I do n't know nothin ' about him . The only thing I can tell ya , he was sharin ' a pad with his cousin . You know , the one that plays piano . " " Okay , Lincoln , " Sullivan said , letting him know everything was all right . " Yeah , I know Zack . Is he still playing at Toxie 's ? " " Uh huh , he 's still playin ' there . " The piano was playing . A candle was stuck in the saucer on top of it and other candles flickered on a few tables along the wall , making faces barely distinguishable in its reddish glow . Toxie , a short , balding black , had let them in through the irongrated door in the basement , which he always kept closed , admitting only people who were in good standing with him .

The customers paid for the booze but he gave them an unwatered honest measurement . And his down-home food was known all over Harlem . A swinging door opened at the end of the hall and a white-shirted waiter came out of the kitchen . He squeezed in between the conversing Sullivan and Toxie , the platter of ham hocks , turnip greens and black-eyed peas smoking deliciously as he passed Pope and went into the candled room . Another waiter , on the other side of what was once the main room of a parlor floor and basement , used a pocket flashlight to make change . In its fringe of light Pope was surprised to see how many people were in the room . All the tables were filled and all the eyes seemed to be staring at him . The candle on the piano did n't cast enough light to read music by , but it did n't matter . Zack could n't read it anyway . He was blind . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played the melody caressingly , repeating a particular chord he liked and never replaying it exactly the same way . The song was somebody else 's , but the music was his and he rearranged it to suit his talents and taste . To some he seemed to be distorting it in the fits of improvisation , but to the purists who knew what jazz was all about , Zack had it all .  | Sullivan stood beside the piano with Pope and watched the blind man 's easy rhythm as he flourished the end of the number . " When are you going to leave this dive , Zack , and give Garner a run for his money ? " " Hey , who 's that ? " He grinned and cocked his head toward the voice . " It 's me , Zack . Frank Sullivan . " " Hey , man , how ya doin ' ? " And the smile broadened . " Long time no hear . " " And what I hear is still good , " Sullivan said . " You 're playing better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's like me and you and maybe some cat sittin ' off in the corner are the only ones that know about it today , man . Maybe I should plug a couple a batteries into the piano and wail a little rhythm and blues . " His hands hit a couple of heavy chords imitating a rock-and-roll beat , and he laughed . " Hey , Zack , I want to introduce you to my partner , Bill Pope . " The blind man hung his right hand above the keys . Pope leaned over and shook it . " Nice meeting you , Zack . And Frank 's right , you do play great . " " They 're still teamin ' you up with a black man , hey , Frank ? " " The Department 's determined to integrate me yet . " Sullivan smiled . " Hey , have n't you heard ? " Zack said . " The black man he do n't want integration . All he want now is the money to buy gas for the Cadillac and he got black power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ player toyed with the melody just loud enough to cover their conversation . " What are you two ballin ' tonight , Frank ? " " No , we 're working , that 's why we 're here . We 're trying to find The Nightman . " Zack made a sour face . " You mean Sportin ' Life . That cat he cut out on me owin ' two months ' rent . I had to go around feelin ' for the furniture to see if he sold it out from under me . " " What 's he doing now ? " Sullivan asked . " He ai n't broke . I hear he doin ' all right . " The plate was tapped on top of the piano . The waiter said , " Request from a customer , Zack . Fly Me to the Moon . ' " He  | laid the accompanying dollar beside the candle . The blind man reached up and folded the bill into his pocket and began to play loudly enough to please the customer but quietly enough that they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' the hustle for Big Alice and a few of her smelly cunt . But he better not get wind of you lookin ' for him or he 's gon na take off , makin ' money or no , ' cause he always said you were always bad news to him . " Zack 's head came up and he smiled . " That is unless he thought he would gain some points . " They had come down Amsterdam Avenue past Lewisohn Stadium and stopped in the shadows of Columbia University 's blocks of sprawling buildings . The coffeeshops , pizza parlors , clothing and book stores were closed , but surrounding streets and buildings were alive with noise and people . Big Alice had used the peephole , recognized them and opened the door . She was a tall , jet-black woman of Jamaican birth and in her forties she was turning to fat , but when business backed up , she still turned the trick . " Now I do n't want no police trouble . I pay my ice the first and the fifteenth , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the curtained front room , " and I 'm all square and I got my paid-up connections , so do n't you two be disruptin ' my business . " Two young whites , looking as though they should have taken the downtown subway home when their classes ended , sat apprehensively on the edge of the sofa . They dropped their eyes , embarrassed under Sullivan 's baleful stare , and both stood up unsurely and started to edge toward the curtained door . " Now where you boys goin ' ? You sit right down , you hear . It wo n't be long . I 'll have a couple a my gals ready for you in just a minute . It 'll be worth your wait , I promise . " Big Alice 's voice stopped them . They looked at her , then at the detectives , then banged into each other in their haste to get to the street . Irritated , she turned back to the detectives , the loose robe bouncing in an overflow of cleavage that gave evidence it was n't for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now see what you do . You see . You scare a couple of live ones away . "  | " You 're better off , Alice . They look like a couple of wild ones , " Frank Sullivan said with a straight face . " You know them college boys fool around a lot and you do n't want your girls takin ' a chance on gettin ' a dose now , do you ? " " Huh , " she snorted , and waved disdainfully at his humor . " That kind of joke do n't cover what they were goin ' to pay . What you two want here anyway ? " " The Nightman , " he said . " We want to talk to him . " Her eyes squinted suspiciously and she started to shake her head in denial . " Oh , he 's clean , " Sullivan said , " as clean as that punk 's ever going to be . And if it makes it any easier for you , we 're not here to bust him . " She stared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know where he about . " They heard footsteps go down the hall and the front door open and close . The curtain that hid the rear bedrooms was pushed back and out came a girl wearing a cheap rayon robe tied tightly about her . She had just run a comb through her dark hair . Her features were plain , her skin more white than brown . She was about seventeen . Her bored eyes were a lot older as she looked over the detectives , apparently thinking they were a couple of new johns . But she became skeptical , then alarmed by their sternness , and mumbled something to Big Alice in Spanish . " You just go back in there and cool off , honey , " Alice answered . " It 's okay . Everything 's all right . This ai n't business for you . " The three of them watched her go languidly back through the curtain . Sullivan looked at Alice . His mood had changed , manifesting itself in a grim scowl . " Now what are we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I told you I want to talk to The Nightman and I do n't want to see you shake your head at me again because I do n't care who you 're paying off . I 'll close you down right now , and you better believe it . " " Take it easy . " She raised her hand in a placating gesture . " Take it easy . I was gon na tell ya . I do n't know where he at this minute . He were here a little while ago but he went back out on the street like he were gon na bring in some trade . But for all the  | business he bring around I like to starve . " She shook her head , annoyed . " You know that boy 's big vice , he think he some kind of a pool champ . He more than likely out tryin ' to take somebody 's drinkin ' money away from them when he supposed to be out hustlin ' up some customers for me and my girls . "  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ramp to the elevated West Side Highway and headed north . It passed the billowing luxury liners , their tonnage berthed with a ponderous dignity , wearing strings of night lights like nouveau riche women wearing garlands of jewels . The car made the quick sudden turns along the cobbled and worn road , passing the tired , once proud heavy old apartment buildings that now pensively share Riverside Drive perches with new high-rise middleincome buildings . On the left , farther uptown in the distance , cars crossed to New Jersey on the George Washington Bridge , flickering commuting fireflies in formation rushing to the wombs of suburban garages . Nick Difalco looked across the darkened river , looked at the Palisades lights and geographically tried to approximate the don 's home along the blackened Jersey cliffs . He had made his call from a public booth as soon as he left Giaccano . " Get me Morello and Parini . Have them meet me in an hour at the Mancian Hotel . " They did n't flinch when he briefed them on what they had to do . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No questions were asked ; they knew better than to pry too deeply . He told them they were both working on bonus money and this helped in covering the open hits . From their disciplined silence  | and eyes , Difalco sensed that they were proud that he had singled out their muscle from the dozens of button men he could have tapped , that he had recognized their grim talents of violence . And they also knew a job as big as this would not go unnoticed in The Family . The highway lamps flashing past threw streaks of pale light inside the car , silhouetting the beefy shoulders and wide neck of Tony Morello , his dark hair glistening behind the wheel . Through the rear-view mirror Difalco caught a reflection of the coarse face of Mario Parini , sitting beside the driver . He was smaller than Morello but had the granite , flat features of a fighter . His swarthy skin , shades darker beneath the hat , and his eyes were lost in the sunken shadows of his face . In a straight rub-out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more experienced soldiers , but he knew these out-in-the-open contracts called for more balls , more brutal ambition than an older man might possess , and he had to be sure of his backups working on such strange turf . So he went with the young and he felt satisfied with his choices . The car plunged down a darkened ramp , emerging into a cobblestoned , shadowy street . They moved slowly now along the wide , mean avenue , emptied of its daylight clamor of trucks and shouts and smells of men . They rolled around a junk cart piled with the price of a bottle and pushed by a derelict . The tugs moored to rat-infested docks seemed to pull at their lines , trying to escape from the rotting wharfs and condemned warehouses . The garage 's red bricks were blackened by years of soot and they almost missed the sign hanging tilted and loose : " LIMOUSINES , 24 HOUR SERVICE . " The wino stumbling past in a nightmare of alcohol stopped , discerning a touch , but as he stood there weaving , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he hesitated and said nothing , for their truculent eyes frightened him . Their sardonic silence broke in impatient raps on the door of the garage and the wino lurched down the desolate street and away from their menacing presence . A burly Negro guard opened the door . Single file , past gleaming Cadillacs sitting incongruously in the low-ceilinged squat  | dusty garage , they followed him to a panel door in the rear . Four flashily dressed blacks standing around a desk turned at their entrance , frowning . Difalco 's dark , vitriolic eyes in the forceful , high-cheekboned face moved them with servile steps back into the corners of the room , away from the desk . " Nick Difalco ! " The bass voice rumbled out of a large , fiftyish , graying Negro . Seated in a high-back leather chair as though on a throne , he dominated the room with all the elegance of a potentate surrounded by his retinue . Pushing back theatrically from behind the large onyx desk , he strode heavily across the rubber-tiled floor . On a knotty-pine wall above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like an ash-black African king . He was a fleshy man in an expensive , well-cut suit , who moved with a surprising agility that belied his bulk . Like a former athlete gone to age and fat . But Difalco knew the surface softness was a sham ; it covered a ruthless drive that had pushed Doc Johnson to the top of the steaming black underworld . In a ghetto that respected few , Doc Johnson was a revered living legend . To many downtrodden Negroes he was truly an American success story , which had started twenty-five years before when he arrived in New York with just the clothes on his back , one jump removed from a Georgia chain gang . But he did n't walk into an arid black belt like so many other new arrivals from Alabama and the Carolinas and Mississippi , hoping for industrial work . He was an industry unto himself . He had a vast talent for turning the quick , dirty buck that led him into cutting dice games , the hustle of numbers , and dope , which was just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . He started cornering a corner , then a block , then a neighborhood , and building a reputation , always knowing what and who was ahead of him . Some said he handled the gun himself when the former black Mafioso front man 's life was blown out of him on a Harlem street . It left a void and he was the logical successor so they nominated him and he filled it , bringing in more money than old man Giaccano thought could ever be squeezed out of uptown . " Nick , how are you ? " he said , with the smile of a thousand amiable darkies flashing across his mouth . Halfway across the room , he extended his hand , but the brown eyes were hostile .  | Difalco ignored the hand ; the taut skeletal face stared as if viewing some foul object . He held this look for a long moment , then brushed past the large man , purposely , filling the room with tension . The silent arrogance excoriated Johnson and his black hoods , who held to the walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's searing contempt . Difalco turned and sat at the edge of the desk and folded his arms across his chest . Johnson had now moved , his assumed smile gone , and Nick Difalco could almost see the anger crawling under the black skin . Doc Johnson knew Difalco 's reputation better than he knew the man , and he was surprised to see him . It was n't their style to send up somebody this soon and certainly not one of the syndicate 's top enforcers  --  not in Harlem on this night when every cop would be out busting his ass to smell out any kind of lead . He had thought old man Giaccano would cool it for a couple of days , waiting to see what floated up to the surface before he 'd ask for an explanation of how the money was lost , along with their two grays and his own blacks . He knew the best approach was a straight story . It was going to be hairy for a while but he could face their immediate anger  --  unless they thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ever so slowly , Johnson forced the bogus smile across his broad black face again . A distasteful putdown was hard to swallow in front of his own . " They did n't waste much time in sending you up here , Nick . " His tone was friendly . Accepting Difalco 's affront seemed to ease the tautness of the room slightly . " What happened tonight , Doc ? " Difalco 's raspy voice came like a controlled bark from the thin mouth that barely moved . Johnson 's hands parted patronizingly in a gesture that seemed to say to his black underlings : This is the way to play it . " That 's what I 'd like to know . Right now you know as much about it as I do . Nothing 's changed since I called the old man , except now we 've got a lot of helpers . The bulls are on the street shaking everybody down for some kind of information . It 's like them and us are all on the same side tonight , " he added with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Difalco snapped , ignoring Johnson 's attempt to mollify him . " Like I told Giaccano , the full weekly take . It was all up there  | and they took every penny , every last goddamn dime , and a few people , too . " He felt conspicuous with Nick 's men standing behind him like white robots . He walked away from the door with shoulderrolling arrogance , past a serving bar , without offering a drink ; that would seem too much like an act of submission . Casually he went around the desk and spread his bulk assuredly in the chair . " You told Giaccano this was a colored hit . How do you know ? " Difalco asked , half sitting , half leaning on the edge of the desk , hanging rapaciously above him . Slowly Johnson pushed back in the chair and hiked his feet , in their sixty-dollar shoes , to the top of the desk . He snorted humorous contempt , his eyes going across the room to his Negro muscle as if Difalco had said something funny . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's right , no big bad Charlie planned this ; this was strictly a black man 's gig . I got that straight from the scene , but did n't need to be told , ' cause no white man outside the organization would know how I operate up here . And even you people downtown do n't know all about the guys and the collectin ' styles I use . No , it could n't be cased by no Charlies , ' cause even if they had the guts to nose around , they would have stood out like a white hooker at a black revival . " " How do you know fuzz did n't engineer this ? " Difalco lashed at him . " They got a book on you that might have interested some ambitious cop . I think you 'd be an easy mark for a greedy man trying for a big score . " " Oh , I 'm ahead of you , " Johnson answered . " Yeah , they 're takers all right , and maybe they could have pulled it off , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way , they were willing to bet their lives against the money , and I ai n't seen a cop willing to go that far yet . And there 's another reason why I threw the idea out . He 'd still have to work up here , holding onto the front and being worried about the guys he was in with and all the while knowin ' how easy it is to get anyone , including a cop , in Harlem . " Johnson shook his head , a derisive grin ticking the corners of his mouth . " No , sir , man , no cop pulled this off . " Difalco sensed a subtle Negro putdown , which was echoed by the sly grin on the face of one of Johnson 's lackeys lounging in  | a leather chair near the desk . He remembered his instructions : " You go up there , Nicky . You make that son-of-a-bitch jig work for you . You let him know we just consider him nothing but hired help who 's responsible for us to lose a big pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your guy who was covering the entrance of the house  --  how come he did n't do something ? " " Because he was in the tally room upstairs , " Johnson answered defensively . " We send a guy up to protect the money when it 's bein ' counted . " Difalco 's grating voice still probed for an opening . " Your guy 's supposed to cover the front door and you tell me you had him up in the room . " His face twisted and he shook his head disdainfully . " I came up here expecting to hear a better story than that . That 's got ta sound like you do n't give a shit or maybe you 're losing your touch . " " Who the hell expected this ! " Johnson shouted , for Difalco was now belittling his abilities to manage the district , and pride would n't let him hold still for this kind of assault . " I been turning the collection over to downtown for ten years and not once " ? his finger moved up in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animosity ? " not once have I been hit . There 's a first time for everything , so you go easy , Nick . I 'm no punk running numbers in the back room of some gin mill . I worked too mother-fuckin ' hard in building Harlem into one of the best money areas the organization has , and it always got an honest count , so nobody tears me down for one losing night  --  you , Giaccano , nobody . " Johnson 's blacks bluffed casualness along the sides of the room and Difalco 's two whites peered inconspicuously from the door . But for all their silent , professional calm , they were rooting spectators intensely watching their rated fighters verbally maneuver , and lead and counter , and they were a little awed by the way Johnson had suddenly turned things around and was taking control . " When he sees you , Nicky , he 'll know I 'm not fuckin ' around . He 'll know I 'm putting him on trial , and if he do n't come through , well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | you still get a contract , Nicky  --  him . " Difalco 's mouth tightened into a chilling semblance of a smile . " Oh , you 're no punk , " he said softly . " That 's why I 'm up here . You 're getting personal service . " The smile jumped off his face . " But when you give me stinkin ' answers like what a good job you 've been doin ' , you 're pilin ' up the past to cover a bad present . Now is what matters , Johnson , not the last ten years . You screwed up , and I want to know what you 're doin ' about tryin ' to remedy it . " His hand swept scornfully toward Doc 's Negro help . " And how about them , or are they just dummies you keep around for laughs to tell you what a big man you are ? " Johnson stared scowlingly at him . He knew Difalco was talking for the Giaccano family and that sobering thought was reason enough to check his temper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet off the desk , his hand went to a humidor and he unwrapped a cigar , using the time to cool himself down . Still , why the hell was Difalco pushing him so hard , as though he was trying to force him into an outburst he would n't be able to back off from ? No , they could have no idea what he was thinking ; it was just a coincidence ... . " Do n't you worry about it , " he said evenly , making a show of lighting the cigar . " I got most of my guys out bird-doggin ' the area . If they 'd come across anything out of the ordinary , I 'd have known about it , and I was just about to send out a couple more just before you gentlemen arrived , " he added mockingly , rolling the cigar along his protruding pink lips . He looked at a burly , well-dressed black who sat in a cushioned chair . " JJ , you take Swinger and you move along Lenox from a Hundred and Tenth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and restaurants and the whorehouses for the action that 's not normal , man . Talk to the bartenders and managers and if anybody asks you why , you tell them Doc 's interested . You 'll get cooperation . " One Negro hood got up slowly , another pushed away from the wall . " And , JJ . " Doc 's voice halted their steps . " You spread the word I 'm laying a thousand out on each head I can chop off . " JJ nodded and was about to leave when Difalco 's strident voice stopped him . " Hey , you , boy . " His caustic tone turned them around , their eyes showing hate for his white-boss arrogance .  | " If you get lucky , " Difalco said , " do n't touch them . You call back here . You understand ? " He turned and looked down at Johnson . " And you can tell the rest of your boys that , too . " Surprise and irritation made Doc stare up at Difalco . " Yeah , you heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is our kill . " " Hey , I do n't need you up here to do my enforcing , " Doc snapped , but the unexpected order had shaded the tone . " If you want to stick around and see how I operate , okay . But I do n't want no white man doing my hatchet jobs , not in this black man 's ghetto . " Nick Difalco slowly shook his head . " Not this trip , pal . This is the corporation 's contract . All we want is your boys to find them . " A scornful smile caught the side of his mouth . " And you do n't even have to get off your black ass to help . " Johnson was out of the chair , snarling above him , his battle for control lost in a burst of temper no longer able to be contained against this ridicule . " Now , goddammit , you just hold a minute , white man . I been sitting here taking your bullshit since you arrived , just out of respect for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't dig it . If Giaccano got a bitch the way I 'm running things up here , let him tell me to my face without sending his guinea muscle to do a contract I 'm well capable of handling . I been given this district to milk long before I heard of Nick Difalco and I do n't need you now to show me how to run the business ? " Difalco smashed his fist down onto the desk , jarring everyone in the room into immobility . " Your business is running our business , " he shouted in a voice that ripped up at Johnson . " You may be somethin ' up here , but below a Hundred and Tenth Street you 're just another fat nigger . " His face constricted , the eyes vanishing behind vitriolic slits . " Giaccano pulled you out of the stink of a back alley and put you up front to represent the Organization ; he calls the shots and if he tells you to shit , you better start squattin ' , fat man . And that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put you in and he can put you out , and you better believe it . Because anybody that loses money is a bad risk and tonight you lost a bundle . " A whispered story told over a drink , or gossip let slip at a  | gathering by some boozed-up Sicilian vicariously enjoying a compatriot 's exploits , words , hearsay , pieces of information that come together and build reputations that are only half believed ? all this might form the background to such a man as Difalco , but now as Doc Johnson stared at him he knew there was nothing false about the man . He was psychotic , the Syndicate prize with a prowess in executions that had earned him frightening respect . But the swarthy hood , for all his reputation , had not frightened Johnson , not even intimidated him . Now , however , Johnson would go no further in fighting for the respect he felt he had long ago earned from the Giaccano family . He worked for them but his relation with the hierarchy was a little different from that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the old don . For he knew they needed a strong buck who could control the turf and move the vices for them in a ghetto that would be too threatening , from its police and its black population , for their white skin to operate out in the open , and he was paid , accordingly , a fraction of the take . It was a true gauge of respect and it had always walled him from the crudities of the Nick Difalcos . But now this breach of the white specialist into the black district to do Johnson 's assassinations had ominous undertones of a beginning of an end . However , he had other plans and he was n't about to demolish them with an insane shooting match with Difalco . Nor would he let the man carry back any more than he already had . He would allow him the story that Johnson backed off , that when the chips are down he 's a yellow nigger and you do n't have to worry about him being out of line anymore . He had n't taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself , you want the contract , take it , you wop bastard , it 's all yours . And he eased back into the chair . " The heist on top of that bad killing you pulled off a couple of months ago . " Difalco ignored Doc 's flag of silent truce and continued to hammer at him . " They 're really startin ' to worry about you . Maybe you 're losin ' your juice , lettin ' things run this loose . " Johnson stuck the cigar back in his broad face , rolling it into the corner of his sullen mouth . " I explained that hit to the old man . It was a must job . Because it was a white cat did n't change a thing ; it had to be done . " " But you ca n't explain this . " Difalco jumped him verbally .  | " One guy in his proper spot could have cut down anyone leavin ' the building . In fact , they would n't even have got up the stairs in the first place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Up there to be taken like some slob . " Doc squinted against the smoke curling up past his eyes . " I 'm not the first guy in the organization that ever lost a take in a stickup . How about that Los Angeles job last winter when almost as much was taken as they got tonight ? " " They were caught and the money returned , " Difalco said quickly , " and it did n't make the papers . And they did n't kill anybody , especially cops , because it was pulled by no hophead shines . " Johnson ignored the derogation as if it had never been said . He released a wafer of smoke from between his heavy lips , his brown eyes watching the cigar cloud rise toward the ceiling and rip apart in an air-conditioner draft . " This was n't pulled by no hophead . " Johnson 's intonation was as soft as the rising smoke . " You got something ? " Difalco forgot the castigations , his tone falling back to a milder rasp of anticipation . " JJ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man ? " Doc 's voice boomed out to the burly Negroes standing at the door . " Did n't I tell you two to go and check along Lenox ? " To the three white men , the tone was anger , a quick-rising , domineering annoyance against the slowness of an underling . But to the two Negroes at the door , his voice and his eyes carried much more . Johnson was telling them he did n't need their asistance , he had control , nothing foolish would happen , and he really was n't taking Difalco 's shit , no matter how it seemed . And like mutes participating in a subtle sign language , JJ and Swinger turned and walked out of the room . " Them boys , they sure slow when you want somethin ' done . I think I 'm gon na make some changes around here , " Johnson said , looking toward the two remaining Negroes , sitting on each side of the room . The telepathic joke , such as pass between blacks when whites are present , was received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , let 's cut out the horseshit , " Nick 's voice cut in sarcastically . " What have you got ? " Johnson looked up quickly into Difalco 's lidded eyes and wondered if he was really that hip . " Just deductions , " he answered  | flatly . " I had good boys up there tonight , some of my best . They were n't letting any amateurs take them , and this bunch ai n't no amateurs . They carried a chopper and took out five guys with one blast . I got a real feelin ' about this ; I think they were playin ' it that way . They did n't want no witnesses . This thing took mother-grabbin ' knowledge of how I operate , and guts . " Nick Difalco , no longer playing a part , was as mesmerized by Doc Johnson 's analysis as were the others in the silent room . " I figure it has to be inside , so I check my group first and they come up clean . Then I start to think about the cats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go through a lot of them because the cat I was lookin ' for would n't be too close to me , but at the same time he had to know the story . You know what I mean ? He needed a lot of things goin ' for him and there 's one guy shapes up as fillin ' that bill . He was one a them that worked in numbers , did some strong-armin ' and once in a while escorted the money on collection day . He did n't work for me long , but he knew the whole setup . About a year ago I lose him . He got messed up for carryin ' a gun ; bein ' an ex-con they had him on a Sullivan rap and he took a one-to-three-year fall . " Doc shrugged his shoulders and his eyes moved toward the others , then went back to Difalco . " Now I could be wrong about this cat ; for all I know he might still be doin ' time . But until I find out otherwise , I got ta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jim Harris , you goin ' to be a rich man . " The laughter was wild , uncontrollable , like that of a gleeful , exuberant child . But in the squalid tenement kitchen it was n't a time or place for laughter . The mirth sounded strange as it echoed off peeling yellow walls and worn oilcloth . It bounced off a stove , which still held food in a pot , and over a sink piled with unwashed dishes and down to the filled paper bag of garbage by the bolted door . The two men at the table stared morosely at him . A yellow shade was drawn over the window and a bottle of booze and an overstuffed bag of money lay open on the table . " Yessir , man , I give you credit . You had this mother figured cold . And you , too , Joey boy , I 'm not forgetting you . " The little man with the scraggly , pencil-thin mustache and dull flat eyes protuberant in his coal-black face jerked his head toward the shot glass he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some slopped to the floor as he downed the drink with one quick movement . His exuberance had not abated since their return to the apartment . Henry Jackson had never possessed more than a couple of hundred at any one time in his life , and now the sight , the touching , the counting of the fortune before him was too rapturous a joy ; if they had let him , no doubt he would have thrown the money over his head to let it rain down upon him while he danced out all the glad dreams of his life . The fact that  | his exultation gained momentum from the belts he took from the bottle seemed to force the two men at the table into deeper shells of silence and his toast to them had brought no response . They had been successful beyond their hopes , but in their victory came no elation , just a cold , frightening memory of their fear . The severity of the crime was still too appallingly vivid to let them unbend . " I was sure enough worried when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , becoming serious and walking toward the table . " And when that gun went off blowin ' out them front windows " ? he stopped and shook his head , letting his eyes roll mournfully ? " I 'll tell ya , man , and I 'll be honest with ya , I came this close " ? his fingers barely parted ? " this motherfuckin ' close to hot-assin ' it out of there . " The two men at the table looked at each other as Jackson leaned over and greedily fingered the money . " But I tell ya , I ai n't worried no more , yeah , no more , " and again the childlike laughter burst from him . The burly man looked up at Jackson . " Henry , I would n't advise any more liquor . " His voice was subdued in its admonishment , but it checked Jackson 's hand as it moved from the money to the bottle . " What 's the matter with you , Jim ? " The humor was now suddenly blown out of Henry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disquiet in the hazel eyes set in Harris 's muscular face . Henry stood staring at him , not understanding the melancholy , then he leaned down and touched his shoulder . " Hey , man , I do n't dig this sadness . You and Joe sit here like a couple of losers . Jimbo , it 's not every day a man makes his fortune ; we got a lot to celebrate about . Come on , it 's past . It 's time to relax and just think about how you do n't ever have to bust your hump again . " They looked at him , each seemingly immersed in his own thoughts . Then Joe Logart broke the silence . " Oh , let him have a blast , there 's no harm now . " Logart 's voice was weary , almost despairing , in ironic contrast to the features in his reddish-black face . The scar on one cheek ended at the lip and twisted the corner of his mouth into a perpetual smirk , as if he were constantly amused by some inner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could all use one , I guess , " he added , and poured out three drinks . And Jim Harris shrugged as if rescinding his caution . Harris rose and stood half a head above Jackson . " It 's too hot for booze , " he said , and walked to an almost dead refrigerator pushed up next to the sink . His hair was cropped close over a cocoa-color broad face and wide nostrils . He was a thick-set man and his T-shirt stuck to his sweating body like another layer of skin . They watched him snap open a can of beer and lift it to his mouth and they watched the muscles of his throat work as he drank . Henry Jackson sat down at the table and lifted his shot glass in another ambiguous gesture that forced Joe Logart to down a drink with him . Somewhere across the court a radio was playing blues and its fading sounds came through the open window , around the pulled-down shade and dimly into the room . The faintly heard lyrics wrapped barriers of detachment about them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought . Only minutes before they had turned their own radio off . They had heard a news broadcast that dispassionately told of their success . There were no leads , everything seemed safe . They had pulled it off , they were home free , and it was time for congratulations . " I was scared up there tonight , man , " Joe Logart said softly . " Like never in my life was I that scared . " Henry Jackson 's hand moved to the remaining drink and pulled it to him and Logart turned and looked at Harris , leaning against the sink . " I never want to be afraid again , man . You know what I mean , Jim ? " " Yeah , I know what you mean . " Harris shook his head , his eyes mirroring the answer . " I 'm  --  I 'm sorry I slowed you down , Jimbo . I kinda went to pieces on ya up there , did n't I ? Thanks for pullin ' me outa it . I ? " " You did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell him he did fine , he wanted to lie to him that they were both great , but they had both been there and that would be ludicrous . " We got what we went after , " he said softly , " and we 're still alive , Joe . We 're here having a drink and talkin ' about it and that 's got to mean something . "  | Sweat rolled down Logart 's face , caught the crevice of his scar and crept over the twisted flesh at the corner of his lip . " I did n't think it was goin ' to be that rough ; I expected it to be tough , but not like it was , not like that . " " Why do n't you forget it , man . " Harris 's tone was pliant with understanding , but he wanted to yell at him to stop the morbid playback . " It 's over and done with ; let it lay , " he heard himself saying . But Joe Logart could n't . It hung graphically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air , bodies strung against the wall and slowly sliding downward , eyes disbelieving , and moans , and the low lamentable cry to Christ . " Everything leading up to it was solid like you could feel and touch it , you know , " Logart whispered . " I musta told myself over a hundred times this was it , we 're goin ' for the big one ; the biggest thing I ever gon na do in my life . But it do n't hit me until I start to climb them stairs and I feel high , like after a long pull on pot when everything starts to be unreal . But only more so , man , oh , more so . Even the shots goin ' off , they sounded like they come from a mile away . And my legs , my legs , Jimbo , they felt like I 'm standin ' on stilts and the floor like startin ' to move . " He stared at Jim Harris , immobile at the sink , listening with his head down . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cried that way , it should 've been quick , no sounds ... no sounds . " His voice trailed off and the tenement kitchen was a stilled chamber of memory that pulled Harris back to the broken men dying at his feet and the choking , sickening smoke twisting up past his face from the gun barrel in a " Hey , hey , come on , you two ! " Henry Jackson 's shiny face creased into a grin . His hand hit the table but he did n't spill the drink ; he had already downed it . " This ai n't the right kind of feelin ' for a party . You got ta shake the blues loose by thinkin ' about all the good action that foldin ' money here is gon na bring . " He turned his head toward Harris . " You , too , man . Come on over and sit down with us and have a drink . " He began to laugh again . " Yeah , baby , it 's no more scratchin ' for a lousy buck from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street on velvet , silk shirts and suits and ? "  | " Get off your cloud , Henry . We ai n't home yet . " Harris 's authoritative growl bit into Jackson , freezing the flat features into irritation . " Hey , baby , you been callin ' the signals from the very beginning , " Jackson protested . " Now that it 's over , man , and we 're winners , how about lettin ' up , huh , and lettin ' us live our lives and start enjoyin ' some of our feelings ? " Harris walked back to the table , his big body filling Jackson 's view . " I 'm still callin ' the shots , Henry , and do n't you forget it . If you think we 're over the hump you better guess again . From here on in we got ta cool any thoughts about swingin ' with the money for a long time , and you just better believe it . " Jackson worked his mouth into a pacifying grin without mirth . " Oh , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure some joy talk gon na make you and Joe feel better . That 's all , just tryin ' to cheer things up . And I 'm goin ' along like you planned , you know , like all the way . " Satisfied , Harris softened his tone and spoke to Logart . " How about you , Joe ? Now that we scored , any doubts in your mind about me callin ' it to the end , or do you want to jump out now ? " Logart returned the questioning stare . " You sold me a wild scheme , " he answered slowly . " I had my doubts from the start , but I bought in because I was movin ' to nowhere and I knew it was the only chance anybody ever goin ' to offer me to get out of the shit . " He nodded toward the money and his hand gently touched one of the stacks of counted bills . " If I died goin ' for this tonight , at least it would have been goin ' down for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , I ai n't about to knock success . You proved your point , man . I stay with the scene right down the line . " " Well , I 'm glad you still feel that way . Yeah , I 'm glad you both feel that way " ? Harris 's eyes stayed with Logart 's , waiting for a reaction ? " because things have changed . I 'm not goin ' to hole up as long as I said . I 'm breakin ' up the rest of the plan . I 'm goin ' to sit on the money for a lot less time than I said . The day after tomorrow , thirty-six hours from now , we take our shares and run . If I thought I could move on them now , I 'd give you both your shares and I 'd cut out . "  | Joe Logart did n't disappoint him . Harris saw the scar along his cheek pulse as he pulled his lips into a twisted , inadvertent smile of suspicion . Logart looked over to Henry Jackson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very beginnin ' , " he said , choosing his words cautiously , " that we got ta stay with the plan . Once we start , you said , we do n't jump around ; no matter what happen we live with the scheme . " Logart came forward , almost leaning on top of the money . " A week was needed to cool down the hunt and you said that would be tight . But there goin ' to be some safety after that to move around and it made good sense and , man , we agreed to sit and sweat it out because it was the backbone of the whole hit . Our safety valve , you called it . " Now he was thoroughly back in the present , his mind attuned to his share of the money in a bag that overflowed voluptuously like a bigtitted woman . " I do n't like changin ' dice in the middle of a hot roll , man . You been right so far ; now you do n't sound so right no more . Like you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listened impassively . He felt Logart had the right to question him . Jackson did n't count . He was on a gravy train . Twenty thousand dollars just for wheeling them away in a hot car . But it was different with Logart . They had been friends for years and he had called him in Detroit and brought him in and hooked him on a proposition that he knew was the longest of shots . And he had laid down strong , inflexible rules and Logart had listened , respecting his toughness and relying on his inside knowledge . Now this sudden change made Logart suspect a cop-out . Maybe he had seen the crack in the hard-guy surface . It was there to be seen . For Jim Harris now doubted that he could have stayed cooped up with so much gold , knowing the final phase of the plan and what was on the street looking for them . He knew now that the temptation to run was too big to have held him still for a week . Yes , Joe Logart had the right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the right words . " I wanted to stay with it , Joe ; I mean I meant to play it like I called it , man . Right down to the final blueprint . And I would have ? " He caught himself and was embarrassed by the thinly disguised apology , embarrassed by their eyes staring silently up  | at him . His voice hardened and his big frame came out of its slouch . " Baby , this mother fucker changed when them two cops came in that hall . I did n't figure the law in on this . It was goin ' to be tough enough just goin ' up against Doc Johnson . He moves real big up here , but he do n't have that many guys . And when he gets a no-show he gon na have to wait to see where the money starts flowin ' because it 's the only thing he can do , man , and a week of hidin ' would of cooled the trail . Cooled it enough where we 'd be able to travel a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window had ceased for Joe Logart and Henry Jackson as they sat intently , watching Harris 's big frame hover above them . " The cops they wo n't sit back like Johnson ; they do n't work that way . They 're gon na keep on comin ' . " All they could hear now was his rigid justifications . " They 'll blanket this whole black area , man . They 'll talk to everybody and they look everywhere . They 'll turn Harlem inside out and they 're never gon na stop . Because they got the troops to keep goin ' at it . And the longer I sit chained up here with all this money , the more chance we 're givin ' them to find me . " Logart dropped his eyes from Harris 's and his fingers began to worry the empty shot glass . " And there are other things now to consider , Joe . Things I put down before but now look kinda strong , like maybe people livin ' in this building start thinking I 'm an oddball cat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showin ' my face . They get curious , start talkin ' ; maybe they even think that now . Course , ever since I rent this place I been tryin ' to duck them . Or maybe what 's worse , some strungout junkie tries to bust in , figurin ' nobody 's home , it 's so quiet , and he got an easy touch . I 'd have to burn him and I do n't want to be sittin ' here with no dead body . " His voice trailed off tonelessly . The pallid light jammed into the ceiling made the three of them appear to be black waxwork figures that through some mechanical miracle were able to perspire , giving their mute , still forms a more lifelike appearance . " He 's right , man . " Henry Jackson shook his head seriously . " Jimbo 's right , " he reiterated in a tone he felt emulated Harris 's quiet authority . " When you waste a couple of fuzz , you got big trouble . They got a tough code . If Big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound all right to me . " He looked over at Logart . " Because , man , if word ever got around he sittin ' up here with this kinda money , he would n't have enough bullets to shoot all the people that would be tryin ' to come in here and take it from him . " Being an optimist , he thought Harris had covered the dangers , but he went along with it because it would put him closer to twenty thousand dollars , five days closer to changing his dreams and avaricious hopes into realities . Logart , his finger tracing a line through some of the spilled liquor , acted as though he had n't heard Jackson at all . He said to Harris , " I guess you know what you 're doin ' , man . It 's just that ? " " If you think I 'm pullin ' somethin ' cute , Joe " ? Harris cut into his halfhearted submission . His voice was detached ; no anger , not even annoyance . Nigger , nigger , he cried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled tighter , I lead you by the hand into a promised land of a hundred thousand dollars , lay it at your goddamn feet , and ? " then stay here with me , " he said softly . " I got room , you can pad right up here . And if you really got your doubts , man , you can sleep right on top of the money . " Joe Logart dropped his eyes from Harris 's blunt stare and slowly , self-consciously , shook his head . " I 'm sorry , Jim , if it sounded like that . Do n't mind me , huh ? I 'm not thinkin ' too clear yet . You know what I mean , man ? It 's just we came so far from what you laid down in the beginning , I just do n't want anything lousin ' up now , that 's all . " " I do n't know what you goin ' on about . " Jackson bounced his hand off the table , letting his true character flow back and almost spilling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we get our cuts , the better . That there money were n't meant to be sittin ' around nohow . It 's meant to spend . That 's right , ai n't it , Jimbo ? Like enjoy , huh , man ? " He raised the shot glass to his lips and downed it . Harris pulled a chair around and sat down at the end of the table between them ; his concern now was Jackson 's eagerness and he tried to modify it , at least subdue it for a time with what he felt to be the truth . " Henry , after you get your cut I ca n't tell you how to spend it . You and Joe well earned your shares ; you  | can do anything you want with them . But I want to warn you , if you 're lookin ' for a long life you 'd better take it slow , nothin ' flashy . " " Now , Jim , " Jackson answered , rolling his protruding eyes in his black , shiny face and playing for laughs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't intend to spend big , baby , because my share is just a little of portion of that there money . Oh , I ai n't complainin ' , you two cats did all the chance-takin ' , especially you , an ' you put it all together and made it work . But I got enough out of it , that satisfyin ' . It 's goin ' to let me treat myself well . Yeah , it sure will ! " and he rolled his eyes again and laughed . His arms spread out as if he held them in a cooling breeze and he grabbed at some of the bills lying on the table and let them fall through his fingers . His likable ease and the communication of his laughter reached toward Logart . " What you gon na do with your money , Henry ? " Logart asked . " You goin ' to get one of them downtown gray bitches and do some swingin ' ? " Jackson lit a cigarette , taking a long , pompous pull as he relished his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceiling and then leaned importantly over the table and looked at Logart . " I 'm goin ' into business . I 'm bustin ' outa this deadbeat , dead-assed town and I 'm goin ' to Chicago and look for a nice bar to buy over on the swingin ' black South Side . " " That 's a fine hip business , Henry . You can always make a good buck on that . There 's always a demand . But what kind of owner you goin ' to be , you goin ' to spring for every fourth round ? " Logart let himself relax still further into Henry Jackson 's easy optimism , for Henry was again bubbling , exuberant , giving himself freely to happy visions . But then Henry looked at Jim Harris and his good cheer faltered . Harris 's solemn gaze directed back at him made the smile stick to his face . He felt as if Harris were pitying him , as if he were staring at some dumb creature caged behind bars in a zoo . Quickly Henry turned around . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sustain the conviviality , " why do n't you come with me , man ? We can go in partners and instead of a gin mill we can maybe buy a fancy cocktail lounge . You  | know , like one of them white cheatin ' joints where they got them low lights that makes all them gray bitches look good , while they foolin ' around with all them married guys . Why , man , a couple o ' sharp cats like us , we 'd do okay in that town . " " No , thanks , Henry , " Logart said softly . " I got plans , too , but in the opposite direction . Like France and Italy and maybe a touch of Spain . My old stompin ' grounds during the service bit . I always wanted to go back someday " ? his hand motioned to the money " but never thought in this kinda style . Henry , my share 's gon na look like three , four times the amount over there . " His eyes gleamed in kinetic remembrances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ base in Bavaria , of the accumulated leave he had used and the three-day passes to Paris and Rome and Barcelona , of the good wine he had drunk and the whores he had jugged , and the sights he had seen . " You got ta see the towns , Henry , they 're old with lots o ' history , with pictures hangin ' on museum walls that are worth a million dollars . And the people , you ask them for directions and they all take their time and tell ya , sometimes even drawin ' you a map . And they all seem young with smiles on their faces , even the old ones . I tell ya , man , it 's all beautiful . " The idea of picking up and putting down in a foreign country seemed too strange an abstraction for Henry Jackson to imagine . He had been born and bred in the black ghettos and felt comfortable only with the familiar . America was his country and he wanted to live and die there and the hell with the foreigners ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put him down as a lame . Fresh blues were audible once again , flowing at them from somewhere . And Harris and Logart went back into their silence . But Jackson had an avuncular feeling for the two younger men and he assumed it was his duty to pull them from their gloom . He looked at Harris . " How about you , Jim , where you goin ' to light to ? " he asked . " You goin ' to go down South to one of them cracker towns and buy one of them big houses on the hill that 's goin ' to look down on all that white trash ? " Harris stared somberly at him for a long moment , then answered slowly . " I just want to get out of Harlem alive , Henry . "  | Jackson raised his hands in mock fear . " Do n't say that , man . " He shook his head sadly . " Now do n't say it , you hear . You are the most frettin'est cat I know . Here you engineered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , and you may not know it , Jimbo , but it 's gon na be talked about for the next twenty years . And you 're frettin ' . " Harris ignored him . He got up and walked to the corner of the room where they had piled the blue police uniforms , and extracted two .38 automatics from the heap . He came back and laid the guns on the table . Then he reached into the pile of money , methodically counting out five hundred dollars twice , and pushed it to them . " Here , it 's off the top . You can call it expense money , I do n't care what , just so long as you use it to set up your transportation and have enough left over to pay any tabs , like hotels , or anybody holding chits on you . No sense in tryin ' to skip out , still owin ' somebody , where they 're goin ' to remember and talk about you . Pay your bills tomorrow so when you get your cuts you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a flat , almost indifferent tone and now centered his gaze on Henry Jackson . " And if you got to take care of somebody with more than just a few dollars , you can always send it through the mail later and like with no return address for a thank you , if you know what I mean . " Leaning over the table , he shoved the hand guns at them . " I want you both to hold on to these awhile . I do n't expect any trouble , but you never can tell , right , Henry ? No chance-takin ' now , baby . " " I do n't need no gun , daddy . " Henry 's voice suddenly took on a strange , inimical growl , his face twisting as his hand disappeared below the table and then quickly flared up . The knife snapped open , the large gleaming blade flashing in his hand in a decisive ugly motion . His lips parted still further into a grotesque grin . His eyes showed the contempt he felt for Harris 's solicitude . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut their goddamn belly out . You hear me , I do n't need no gun to protect myself , Jimbo . " Joe Logart stared across the table in surprise at the abrupt change . But Harris knew what was eating at Henry . He realized he offended him as if the repeated warnings were meant as a  | simple putdown to someone he did n't have confidence in . He picked up the gun and held it in front of Jackson . " You take the piece , baby , " he said consolingly . He did n't want to lose him and looked for words to soothe the ruffled feelings . " I want you both packed for better action than that there sticker can give , Henry . You 're too good a man to go down for the want of a weapon . " With his other hand he gently touched his shoulder . " And besides , man , it 's gon na make me feel a lot better sittin ' up here knowin ' you two are packed for some kind of protection . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , Henry . " Slowly Henry Jackson took the gun . He kept his gaze on Harris for a couple of seconds as if silently apologizing , and then slipped the gun into his waistband . Jim Harris straightened up from the table . There did n't seem to be anything more to add . Logart caught the finality of his movement and stood up , too , stuffing the other gun into his pocket . Henry went for the bottle and poured a drink into the shot glass . Then he stood up and raised the drink . " One for the road , " he said , and his head went back as he downed it . " Henry , if you want you can stay here tonight , " Harris said . " We can keep each other company . I got plenty of room ; you could ? " " Why , man ? " Henry smiled . " Because I had a few lousy drinks ? Hey , you know me better than that , Jimbo . You know I can carry my booze . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's face . " Would you stop worryin ' , man ? I 'm all right . Johnson 's cats do n't know us . You 're the only one that has to hole up and , besides , I got no time to stay with ya . You forgettin ' you changed our timetable . I 'm gon na be busy clearin ' up a few things before I 'm able to move out feelin ' free and I 'm gon na need tonight as well as tomorrow to take care of it . " Harris looked at him for a long moment as if deciding what to do . " Okay , " he said , " but you just make sure you play it cool . " He turned to Logart . " I 'll see you both back here ; make it twelve noon the day after tomorrow . " " You know it , " Logart answered , his eyes wandering to the money lying at the end of the table . " Guard it good , Jimbo . I 'm only going to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , baby , it 's like it 's in a vault . They 'd have to crawl over me to get at it , " Harris said unsmilingly , then he turned , walked to the door and unbolted it . Jackson stopped on his way out and shook hands . " I 'll see ya in a couple of days , and do n't worry about me , man , okay ? You just relax and get some sleep . " And he stepped out into the hall and started down the steps . Harris grabbed Logart 's arm as he passed him . " I do n't want nothin ' kickin ' wrong now , so you keep an eye on him . You know what I mean ? " Logart nodded , then stepped out into the blackness and followed Jackson down the stairs . Jim Harris listened to their receding footsteps , then closed and rebolted the door .  | The cue stick wove above the ivory ball on table one like a magic wand in the hand of the big dusky in the pink shirt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corner pocket , where he intended to drop the sixth consecutive ball in his run . The hand cupped on the green felt and the cue moved liquidly , professionally through the curled fingers . The eyes narrowed below a forehead rippled in concentration . The stick paused in its backstroke , then flicked forward just as the shooter caught sight of them coming through the door . The ball hit with the lazy sound of a missed shot . The player 's small , consumptive-looking opponent , staring down at the table , flashed yellow teeth and suppressed a sarcastic laugh . Pop Gibson , the proprietor of the academy , sat hunched over a glass case by the window reading the morning line of horses and he squinted in the bad light as he followed them back past the second table , where the shark of the house practiced in solitude , unmindful of the three teen-agers stiffening in the high chairs along the wall , silently watching them move back past the darkened third and fourth tables . The two men in a game of straights at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The short man , his expensive silk suit reflecting the green shaded light hanging from the ceiling , leaned across the table professionally . His cue slowly rode back , lining up the shot , then a hand picked up the ball . The shooter whirled  | his mouth , ready to explode words in a rush of anger , but the pockmarked face froze . " Hello , Nightman , " the voice said as he squinted up into the pale-blue eyes of Frank Sullivan . The other player stood trancelike , the cue at his side like a bedraggled soldier , waiting as though the intrusion were a momentary natural stoppage . " Take a walk , " the detective said sharply . But his voice failed to stir the shabbily dressed player across the padded felt table . " Get the hell out of here . " Sullivan 's tone tightened into a physical threat but the immobile face remained impassive . The purple lips parted and started to form sounds , then stopped . Bill Pope walked toward the man , his hand ready to grab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ass in the direction of the door , but the dreamy-looking Negro stopped him when he spoke . " I beat him . " He raised his hand and pointed at The Nightman . " I whipped him clean and he owe me a fin . " The voice seemed to wallow in addiction . Sullivan studied the face , then turned to The Nightman . " Pay him . " They watched as The Nightman pompously laid the cue stick across the table , his hand going in a big movement to his wallet , and he opened it as if it were a Bible , rippling the bills , and pulled out a fiver . His dreamy opponent took it , his expression never changing ; he turned , stuck his cue stick in a rack along the wall , and seemed to shuffle out on a cloud . Frank Sullivan 's lips pressed across his teeth , but he was n't smiling . Instinctively The Nightman turned his head , his body tensing . He felt he was going to be hit . " Are you pushing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barely audible . " Now you know I 'm not messin ' around with the junk no more , man . " The answer came quickly . " You got a tap on the community ; you know I been clean . I 'm an independent now ; I move for myself , and pushin ' the drugs ai n't one of my things . A man can get busted too easy for that . " The blow had n't fallen and The Nightman seemed to find courage . " If that cat 's on it he did n't get no duji from me and you know it , man . Go ahead , search me. "  | The other people in the urine-odored hall stood silently waiting for the hipster to disappear between the tables , to be dropped there by the stocky white detective . Bill Pope scowled at them and they turned slowly , uncomfortably back to their games . The three teen-agers had left already . The Nightman could feel a knot tightening in his stomach , his fingers twitched . He knew Frank Sullivan , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thought to himself as he tried to force a bored expression on his face . " What you guys want ? " He kept the voice respectful and raised it slightly to carry the hall , playing to the small audience up front . Sullivan was aware of the little hustler 's bit of show and purposely held his own voice down . " I 'll give you three guesses what we want . " The detective 's restraint seemed to lend courage to The Nightman and his hand , a diamond glittering on the pinky , flung out in a wave of rejection . " Man , I do n't want one of your guesses . I do n't like playin ' games . If you lookin ' for somebody for the question-and-answer bit , you ai n't gon na find him in me . " Pope took a step to him . " Hey , punk , you watch your mouth or it 'll end up droppin ' blood . " Like his partner , he had not raised his voice . " Okay . " Sullivan nodded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Nightman was looking for a cover against the inquisitive glances coming from the silent players at the front of the room . " I 'll draw you a picture , " the detective said quietly . " We want a lead on who robbed Johnson tonight and with it killed two cops that got in their way . " " Now how the fuck should I know about that ? " The Nightman 's ridicule spilled out in a stream of scorn that he was unable to stop , for the idea that he was even remotely connected with such a big-league hit came at him with surprise . But he desperately wanted to recall the disrespect , to bring it back to a silence or a grunt or a shrug , for he knew he had overplayed his act . Bill Pope 's large , whitish-brown palm rode up from somewhere below the table and caught him along the cheek . It jolted and turned his head , its sound slapping off the walls and bouncing to the front of the hall . The Nightman 's hand went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fright above the wide-bridge nose  | as he looked at the young Negro detective . " What you do that for , man ? " His veneer was gone and his voice was a whisper . " I 'm only asking a legit question . What I say for you to hit me ? " " The next time , joker , I close the hand . " Pope said it as if he wanted to hit him again . The Nightman turned quickly to Sullivan , who stood hefting the ivory cue ball in his hand and staring at him ominously . The pool hall was now theirs . The other players had deserted it ; their sticks lay across empty tables ; the players were already on the street . Pop Gibson 's white-topped Uncle Tom head could be seen through the front window , as the owner stood outside as if trying to catch a nonexistent breeze . The Nightman 's eyes moved to the ball in Frank Sullivan 's hand and his body constricted in sickening anticipation . " You got a lot of mouth lately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , his voice as soft as before . " I do n't know who you got going for you " ? he shook his head sadly ? " but whoever you 're greasing , it wo n't be enough . " " Hey , wait a minute , huh . You 're goin ' too fast . I got a right to know what I bein ' rousted for , man . " His voice squeaked and his hands parted and he blinked up at Sullivan . " I been a good bag for you , but it 's always been private talk , you know what I mean . And now you come in and lay it on me that you want information about cop killers . Hey , you scare me , man , right down to my feet . For all I know you lookin ' for a fall guy to take the rap . Like maybe I do n't got no witnesses to cover my time for a couple of hours and then I 'm dead , huh ? Man , a cat got to fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway , Nightman . " The detective 's voice did n't rise , but the sardonic tone dug deep into the Negro 's fear . " I think it 's about time I stopped using you as a source and closed you out real good . I can run you in any time I want . With your sheet any one of a half dozen charges would do , but if you 're looking for a frame , I 'll give it to you , you son of a bitch . I 'll plant a dope rap on you into a seven-to-ten-year fall and I 'll color it with enough background that 'll ensure you pull the whole stretch . "  | The Nightman had lowered his eyes before Sullivan 's stare , the threats overwhelming him . He tried for coolness and scanned the racked sticks and empty stool-like chairs along the wall , the barren green tables with their score indicators stretched on taut wires above them , and he looked past the detectives to the open door , to the street and escape . He could feel the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armpits down the sides of his body , as memory flooded his mind ... . There had been an outbreak of cabby holdups , a couple of drivers killed , and the papers jumped in with a hard sell . Hopheads , they screamed in three-inch headlines , which brought the inevitable police crackdown . Nothing moved on the streets . The organized pushers went underground to wait out the heat and the addicts started to climb the walls . The Nightman , on the fringe , fighting for a piece of the narcotic action , pushed his meager diluted supply down from the rooftops of tenements to the backs of their halls , then ignorantly out onto the streets , where he would wait under the gray lamps hustling his now overpriced wares to the dark-skinned recipients . The lights flicked on from the battered car that pulled away from the curb and moved through the cold January street and it eased toward The Nightman , a heavy-set middle-aged Negro at the wheel . He ignored it  --  for he was too busy dealing drugs to an addict  --  until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there appeared a white face topped by a snap-brim hat . It was Sullivan 's eyes he remembered most of all . They seemed not to have any pupils , just ovals of cold gray slush that came at him , frightening him by their deadliness , herding him into the back of the car . Three years , he thought , they 're going to take me off the street for three years , while the car drove slowly toward the station house . Three years : that would begin with his booking , his trial , his But the car stopped . Piers loomed in the darkness of the deserted warehouse street . The door opened , the hand of the white devil pulled his collar , dragging the cowering Nightman a decent distance away from the cigarette-lighting Negro at the wheel . " Open your coat , nigger " ? the voice was barely heard through the whipping roar of the wind ? " and get your palms  | against that wall . " A shakedown ; the white bastard is shaking me down . But in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to jail . Sullivan 's hand went through his pockets ; pulling out a wallet , he read the name and his fingers indexed the few hundred stuffed inside it . The other hand had come up with a slim packet of brown paper . He opened it ; his finger touched the powder and he brought it to his lips . His face soured . He let the powder blow away , its whiteness disappearing in a gust of wind . " Nigger , turn around . " Sullivan 's fist smashed into his face , driving him back , and he sagged against the wall . The detective 's right fist drove deep into The Nightman 's stomach . He measured the pain and hit him again , and again , and once more , the other hand keeping him pinned against the wall . Then he watched the sick black face follow the crumbling body to the pavement . His hat rolled into the gutter and he lay at the detective 's feet and Frank Sullivan had to hunch over him so his words would n't be lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm going to give you a break ; I 'm not going to bust ya . But from now on you 're my pigeon . When I want to know something , you tell me . If you do n't , you find out . You hear me , nigger ? " He leaned down closer to his ear , his words chopping rasps of sound . " You hear me ? " The Nightman , his eyes filled with fear , painfully nodded his head . " And I do n't want to see you pushing that goddamn shit no more , you hear me ? " Again the head moved in acknowledgment , the cheek scraping against the cold cement . The detective , satisfied , pulled him roughly to his feet . He weaved and started to go down again , but caught himself . The Negro detective in the car had watched the grotesque charade through the rear-view mirror and now backed up the car to them . Sullivan took the money out of the wallet , grabbed the wind-blown coat and jammed the billfold back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bills through the car window to his partner . " Here , Owen , my contribution toward your retirement . " Sullivan sensed the unasked question . " Do n't worry , Owen , " he said . " I got more than my share tonight ; I got me a talking pigeon that 's going to let me win a few prizes in the foreseeable future .... " The same fists , the same spot . The future was here , thought  | The Nightman as his eyes , lidded and heavy , moved past the closed door of the poolroom toilet and settled on the iron bars covering the back window . " You tryin ' to get me killed , man ? You two come walkin ' in here and start pumpin ' me in front of people . " He shook his head and looked directly at Sullivan at last . " You want word should get around I 'm whorin ' for the law , man ? If that gets around you would n't have to frame me , I 'm out of business like maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woulda met you on the q.t. like in the past , you know what I mean ? " " You lyin ' bastard , " Sullivan said , still hefting the cue ball in his hand . " If you had any idea what I wanted and had time to think about it , I would n't have found you for a month . " " Well , could you blame me ? A little man like me should get off the street when the big boys start to play and this is the biggest I ever heard of . I hear they got almost half a million and left more bodies around than a battlefield . " His dignity seemed restored by what he felt was inside knowledge , and he picked up the cue stick and thoughtfully began to chalk it . " I also hear Doc 's got his boys out in force ; they lookin ' all over Harlem . He 's actin ' like he knows something your boys do n't ; like it 's a local deal . " " Hey , punk , tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut through The Nightman 's thin display of self-assurance . He looked past the detectives to make sure they were alone . He could see the owner 's grizzled head through the front windows , see him stop a couple of players about to come in , motion toward what was taking place ; the players took a furtive glance then quickly walked on . " Well , maybe what I got ai n't new , " The Nightman said quietly . " Like it did n't happen tonight and it could be just  --  what ya call it ? ? yeah , just a coincidence , but if it 's true it sure could be worth a lot of blackmail loot to somebody who wanted to push it . But it 's not my stick ' cause a man could become dead out of it . Like I say , maybe it ai n't worth nothin ' but you 're welcome to it . " He looked at Frank Sullivan . " About two , two and a half weeks ago , I 'm comin ' out of the Calypso @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jim Harris comin ' my way . I say Hi , Jim , ' but , man , this cat looks the other way  | and just passes by like I 'm a total stranger . I never real friendly with him , but it still figure kinda flaky , you know what I mean . Like we know each other enough to say hello . I know he was busted and did a little time recently so I figure he be happy to say hello to me . " " Maybe he 's seen some of your hags . " Pope 's face remained impassive , but the caustic humor could be seen in his eyes . An indignant look spread across The Nightman 's thin face . " I 'm just a little guy tryin ' to make his bread and I do n't like handlin ' any bad-lookin ' bitches either , man , but sometimes they 're the best bangs of all .... " " What 's the Harris history ? " Sullivan 's tone snapped The Nightman back from his digression . " Oh , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that 's why you do n't know about him . He was workin ' for Doc around the same time I was . You know the way Johnson uses his guys , a little strong-armin ' or collectin ' , or even usin ' them to protect the transfer , and in that way he can always use a guy anywhere he wants him . But this Harris he do n't work for him too long before he get busted on some kind of charge . " The detective felt his interest quicken but he sounded matterof-fact as he asked , " What makes you so sure this Harris could be one of the guys in on this hit ? " " Hey , I 'm not sure of nothin ' . I just thought it funny the way he act that time I meet him and then I forgot about it until tonight . " The knowing wisp of a Harlem hip smile touched the corners of his mouth . " Yeah , tonight with all the talk and excitement and everybody wishing they were in on it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good that job was . When I heard about it , I 'm thinkin ' it took Superman to walk in and kill all them guys , includin ' them downtown grays , and take all that money , and then top it off by killin ' some cops . " He shook his head in respect and awe . " Yeah , a great big coal-black Superman . And then it starts to fall in place , real slow at first , like ones and twos , ' cause to make somethin ' like this go was knowin ' Doc 's setup . And this Harris he got ta know it . And then , man , you got ta have the desire and be plenty sharp . You need all that plus bein ' a no-carin ' mother fucker , and this cat 's got the rep of a tiger . "  | The Nightman 's Harlem knowledge had the sound of truth . It was a lead that had to be followed . " Okay , so where do we find this Jim Harris ? " Sullivan kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . " The Nightman shrugged phlegmatically , but he was n't fooled . He knew Sullivan was more than interested . Score one for me , he thought . " Do n't even know if it was him , " he continued lazily , " but if I was you two I 'd sure enough look for him . " " You 're a big help , " Sullivan snarled , trying to mask his appreciation of what The Nightman had already given them . " Oh , I may be yet , " The Nightman answered a little too quickly . " He used to be kinda sweet on a B girl over at the 7 ? 11 Club . Her name is Ivy something or other , I forget now . " He shifted his eyes to the table and gently rolled a ball toward a corner pocket . " The reason I know about this chick is I tried to get her for my stable . She kind of a fine-lookin ' bitch and she would 've fit in real good . One night he told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if you know what I mean ? " He looked up . " Hey , you two act like I 'm puttin ' you on . " An impatient car horn sounded through the open door and echoed back across the empty felt tables . A couple of flies had found the light above the table and buzzed in and out of its brightness . The Nightman 's face was polished in sweat , the perspiration under his arms began to darken his light suit . He tried to read the faces of the two detectives , but their expressions told him nothing . There was a gnawing doubt that maybe he had lost Sullivan , that he had told him too much and should have left some gaps in the story to make it more believable . He held up his right hand , his left holding the cue stick , in what he hoped was a reassuring gesture that would soften the detective 's disbelief . " Man , what I tell ya is the gospel , nothin ' held back . " Sullivan had used The Nightman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come in threes , he thought , incongruously associating it with the Holy Trinity . Sullivan 's lips barely moved . " Nightman , you never had an honest day in your life . " His tone epitomized that of the professional cop . " I 'm levelin ' , man . Why you wan na fight the truth ? " The Nightman 's voice was a pitch too high .  | The detective turned to his partner . " You think he 's telling the truth , Bill ? " Pope caught the inflected mockery . The few months that he had worked with Sullivan had taught him how to judge the moments for subtle play . " Well , we 're sure going to find out if he is . " " Yeah , we are that , " Sullivan answered , his face still sustaining the impression of dissatisfaction , " and if this punk is giving us the wrong lead , he better start running right now . "  | Up past the pyramiding bottles in the center of the circular bar through a haze of smoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stools , their gleaming heads moving with the tempo , and men in tropical suits , standing beside them , reaching for laughs with movements of exaggerated humor . Quick bartenders and hustling waiters , diluted booze and crowded tables . Over it all rotating disks slowly splashed prismatic blues and reds and yellows across black faces . The drummer rolled a crescendo of introduction , forcing heads to turn up to the small stage above the bar . The piano player leaned into the mike . " And now , ladies and gentlemen , the Club 7 ? 11 proudly presents Miss Bobbi Watkins . " The room went dark , then a bright spot flared through the smoke , and lights came up from beneath the plexiglass stage , and she came on . The long white gown , cut low at the breasts , clung and pulled across the full body as she mounted the steps to the throbbing , driving beat of " Night Train . " Her magnetic sway pulled the dusky room to mesmerized silence as her arms lifted seductively from her body . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curved over the breast down the salaciously rolling stomach , moved across the round , supple hips and somehow opened the clip that released the shimmering  | gown down her body in tantalizing , erotic waves . Male faces hung transfixed above their drinks , each isolated in a common thought , as their eyes roamed greedily down the voluptuous body to the gown at her feet . She worked her bunned hair loose and it fell down her back . The full , pointed breasts , their nipples covered by the stickers the law demanded , bounced to the rhythmic drive of the hips . Her head went back , mouth parting to show white teeth , white as snow against the brush of a wet pink tongue that caressed her lips . The musicians played on obliviously ; the drummer bending over his drums belted the mounting beat into a sexual frenzy that drove the chocolate-skinned body sensually higher . And no one moved . Waiters hung back against the walls , bartenders did n't serve and the women in the room were as motionless and quiet as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tightened again , her belly rising and falling and quickening still further . The spotlight gave way to the rotating disks , but this time the spinning gels revolved to the pulsing tempo of her movements . And her body was sheeted in a kaleidoscope of blues and reds and yellows . Beads of sweat popped out across her body , gathered between her heavy breasts , rolled down across the belly catching the navel , then down once again and into the moist G-string between her legs . She ground to a scorch of climax , stopped suddenly , her arms and legs tautening in a culminating stretch of imagined copulation , and she held the G-string in her hand . The lights switched off , cutting the room to blackness . There was a moment of silence , then through the darkness the spontaneous applause reached stimulatingly for her . The lights flashed on again ; she was gone . She had disappeared into the stifling cubicle of a dressing room beneath the bar . The talk and laughter picked up as before and a couple got up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now floated between tables , pushing the watered-down and overpriced drinks . " Hey , Frank , how ya doin ' , man ? " said the mustached manager , standing just inside the glass doors . Here comes trouble , he thought , forcing a smile across his dark face as he watched Frank Sullivan push into the club . " Long time no see , "  | he added , and hoped the smile looked convincing . Bill Pope came up beside his partner and they both squinted in the haze , letting their eyes become accustomed to the dimness and smoke . " How 's it going , Eddie ? " Sullivan asked , not looking at the tuxedo-draped manager , for he was too busy , out of pure habit , trying to make out the faces along the bar and tables . " What you boys checkin ' on , business or pleasure ? " " What do you think ? " Sullivan said tonelessly , and added to the discomfort behind Eddie Whitfield 's smile . A few heads had turned from their drinks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . " Well , I think I 'm going to have an empty place if you two keep standing here counting the house . " The manager slapped him a little too affably on the back . " Come on , let me buy you two a drink . " " This is a business call , Eddie . " There was a noticeable hesitation , the smile disappeared , and the manager 's eyes went to Pope and back to Sullivan . The reflected light over the entrance glared much brighter in Eddie 's mind , spotlighting him and the law for all to see . " So my business is pleasure . Come on , I 'll have one with you , " and he started toward the tables . " You got a girl name of Ivy working in here ? " Sullivan 's question turned Eddie around , his eyes showing concern . " Maybe , " he said guardedly . " Why , what 'd she do ? " " You can relax , Eddie , this is no collar . We just want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the manager 's face . " Just talk , you understand , " Sullivan said , trying to reassure him that there would be no arrest scene , no duplication of the violence he had once visited upon one of Eddie 's felonious patrons who would n't come quietly : Sullivan had promptly put bullets into the man 's leg and hip . " Yeah , yeah , I understand , Frank , " Eddie said slowly , " but she ai n't here . She works here , all right , and her last name is Roberts , but she 's not here yet . She 's due in a little while , so why do n't you two take that drink . When she comes in I send her over , okay ? "  | They nodded agreement but Eddie Whitfield did n't move . " Frank , you do me a favor , okay ? Talk to her like quietly . I got a good house goin ' tonight and if you start flashin ' your badge ... You too , huh ? " He took a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem like such a direct plea to the white detective . " A gun would scare the hell outa half o ' the crowd and I would n't see them around for a while . You know what I mean , man ? You know the trade I get . " Sullivan looked at him and smiled . " Sure , Eddie , nice and quiet . " The manager turned and was leading them past the bar to one of the rear tables in the darkest corner of the club . " This is good , Eddie , " Sullivan said , stopping at the bar . " I do n't want to take your four-dollar cover charge away from a table , and besides , we can see your customers better from here . " Space opened to them as patrons pushed subtly against each other like people in church pews making room for latecomers . But it was not the attitude of share a space , for some knew who he was and the rest could smell cop . They shied away from the white odor of force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the circular bar , Bill Pope did n't count , maybe because he was a black man and did n't have the look of law . Tall , studious , dressed in conservative clothes , he might have been a social worker or maybe a reporter covering the ghetto scene for one of the white papers . But the bartender remembered Sullivan only too well , and without asking what they wanted went for the uncut stuff and set a fresh bottle of J &B; before them . A heavy-set man in a sharkskin suit , laughing loudly as he admired the crossed legs of a tawny bar girl , looked up and the laughter caught and died in his throat as he recognized the white detective staring at him . He finished his drink and quietly walked away from the bar . More heads turned toward the detectives and their space at the bar expanded ; they were fast becoming isolated . " You know , Frank " ? there was a waggish grin on Pope 's face ? " if we were really conscientious cops we 'd bust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was based in reality , for though the 7 ? 11 Club was  | overpriced enough to appeal to some of the newly arrived Negro middle class , its patrons were mainly a crowd of well-heeled dope dealers and numbers men , bookies and guys who 'd broken through and had some illicit bag going for themselves , as well as the would-bes and hangers-on who still hoped to make it illegitimately . " If we did , " Sullivan answered , " we 'd be leaving Eddie here all by himself . " " Hey . " Eddie smiled , not too assuredly . " You cats pull something like that and them white boys who put up the money and own me and this club would have a new front goin ' for them tomorrow . And besides , you would n't do it . They 're holding my mother for collateral . You close me and she never gon na get free from cleanin ' their houses . " The three of them laughed , but Pope felt self-conscious . His easy response to such jokes seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy slowly awakening to find he lived in a white world ... Bill Pope , nurtured by Northern apartheid and bias , and driven by anger and the hardships his family endured to ensure that the first male in their family tree was able to jump down clutching a college diploma . Now he sipped his drink , half listening to Sullivan and Eddie Whitfield talk , half hearing the music and laughter in the background and remembering that it was before the cause and black militants and civil rights marchers , before the sit-ins and riots and death in the streets . When he lived in a far younger world , where they had gathered surreptitiously in threes and fours away from their white so-called fellow students . He could still see one particular black , standing like a bantam rooster , his hand strangling a beer can , as he held forth as their leader in his highpitched vitriolic voice . " I 'll tell you , Billy , I 'll tell you . The ones I respect are the Northern crackers that ca n't stand our black asses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gon na tell you why . Because there 's at least no bullshit in how they feel . They 've drawn the line and try their best we do n't cross it . Oh , yeah , I can live with that because I do n't have to see them every day to know the score , because I know they 're always tryin ' to pitch shutouts . " He remembered the way his friend used to rise up on his toes ,  | his brown eyes glowing in righteous indignation . " Now I 'm gon na tell ya who bugs me more than the crackers . And , man , once you get to know them , baby , you really know them . You know they 're on the other side of a two-headed coin . It 's them so-called liberal bastards that I ca n't stomach . They pick up our slang and act like white niggers . It 's a kick for them , man , when they can say to their white middle-class elders , hoping for shock , Why , some of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come on and tell ya about their history in this country and how tough it was for their ancestors to make it . Or the Italian about his grandfather with the pick and shovel . And the bagel babies always comin ' around hung up on guilt and cock and the only good thing about them , they like to fuck . But , Billy , they all turn , because when they start to climb that white-world ladder and move to the suburbs , their liberalism turns off like the hose on their front lawns . And who have we got left , huh ? Well , I 'll tell ya : it 's the kooks , the wild-eyed whites , schizos and paranoiacs , the sickies lookin ' for a cause , any cause . Now it 's liberalism and we 're their cause , baby . In the thirties and forties , they were the Marxists talkin ' about spreading Mother Russia 's legs around the world ; now it 's sing along with the black man . Who needs them , man , and who needs the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Negro needs is some sleek black cat who could organize like a Walter Reuther or a George Meany and put us more than twenty million people together into a massive economic and political voting bloc . Then , baby , oh , then you would see things change . " Well , the black power advocates who had come along just as his school buddy , Bobby Davis , had hoped knocked the majority of white liberals right out of the civil rights movement . And Bill Pope wondered if that was real wise . So far Davis himself , the man who was going to lead them out of the black wilderness , had failed them . He had taken a federal job for security and got strung out on his own guilt , living in neither a black nor a white world but on a precipice of gray that borrowed from both . And Billy Pope had copped out , too . His ambitions and drives were too strong for him to end up walking a beat as a civil servant . He had majored in humanities and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncertain future . In a wildly changing world he knew he was n't going to move mountains , for he had no fanatic 's drum beating inside him . But he felt he could contribute by working in a black environment among his own people , who needed their own to surmount its walls of ignorance and poverty , to fight for better education and housing and jobs , to put its men back as the heads of families and to pull its women out of whitey 's dirty kitchens . But somehow Billy had lost his way and had found himself sitting with five hundred other men taking the police examination . For kicks , he told himself ; I 'm curious how I will make out , but he had studied the manual diligently before taking the test and had scored well . And had then looked for a rationalization . A man can maybe do more for his own being a ? Who am I bullshitting ? Full salary in three years , time and a half for overtime , use the education to advance and out in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say ? ? cradle to grave . But , baby , a voice would echo out of his past , there 's no real security for a black man because you ca n't lose the color of your skin . Then equality , goddammit , that 's what I 'm looking for , my own personal equality , the same kind of security the white man seeks in civil service . I just want what 's due me , that 's all . But he had not found it . In its place he had discovered something in the job , something he had not realized had existed in him until his promotion from uniform to plainclothes six months before for a good arrest , for chasing and disarming a holdup man on a crowded street in Bedford-Stuyvesant , and his subsequent assignment to Harlem . He found an expanding ego ; now he walked among his own but with a heady authority , feeling the gun on his hip and the badge of entrance in his pocket , and experiencing the ambivalent respect and fear this black community had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paradoxically transformed itself into the guise of superiority . He was sickeningly aware of this self-importance , having seen and hated it in other Negro cops . He wanted to excoriate it , to find where it began and burn it out , this malignant tumor of arrogance .... The trio was taking a break and in the room conversation  | levels dropped without music to compete against . The manager of the 7 ? 11 Club tilted the bottle of Scotch for a second time , filling the shot glass above the false white circle . He leaned toward Sullivan and started a bawdy joke , openly playing for a laugh to soothe the silence of this unpredictable white man . Pope listened to the joke , trying to gauge the reaction on Sullivan 's face to see how far his partner had come back from his personal loss . Sullivan 's eyes in the flickering light were patches of faded blue in an overcast , melancholy sky . Only his mouth reacted , twisting in a brief smile , not in response to the dirty punch-line but to let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not come very far from his sorrow , and he wondered if it was possible ever to recover completely from such a tragedy , such deep remorse . But he knew his partner had control now ; at least the wild sickness of his grief had been dissipated . Bill Pope was pleased about that . A few months ago he would n't have cared if Frank Sullivan lived or died . At that time Pope had cataloged him in his mental file under " racist , " just as he separated and docketed blacks according to his own categories . He knew the fallacy of such an index , that there was more to people than surface judgments could yield , but he also knew that external images and performances reflected basic truths . Yet this elusive white man , by some action , a casual remark or a psychological slip , would break out of the tidy stereotype , would have to be tested against truth , to be placed somewhere else in the Negro detective 's vault of people . At times he was sure he had closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classic cop too quick with his hands , always ready to beat the black man for information ? Then there was the arrogance of the man , cutting a wide swath of reputation through Harlem that would have done justice to a Southern deputy patrolling the black shanties of a cracker town . Now I got you , Sullivan , you fucking fascist , you Northern honkie cracker .... But Pope 's indictments would be jarred at the sight of a tough black youth sticking his hand out , shaking Frank Sullivan 's hand , telling the white detective that the job he had set up for him was working out fine , just fine . Pope would case the kid 's smile for a put-on and would find only warmth , for the chance he 'd been given when he had no more hope .  | Sullivan had known how Pope felt about him and he purposely kept the barrier up , sustaining it with a deliberate aloofness that strained their relationship to just barely above a working association . And Pope waited for the precinct commander to tell him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a beat in the black section of Brooklyn . He knew the standard words that were going to be used against him : " surly , " " uncooperative , " " psychological block . " But the ax never fell . Only the gulf between them was widened still further by the Negro cops in the precinct , bad-mouthing among themselves about their fellow white cops unnecessarily throwing their authority around and singling out Sullivan as a prime example . " You watch yourself , " he was told by a young Negro detective who had been assigned to the precinct shortly before he was . " That man you 're teamed with , he looks for trouble like he do n't care . He steps on a lot of toes and I hear he 's been bounced out of this precinct once already . So you watch yourself with him , you hear ? " But what had finally brought their sour partnership to an ugly head was Sullivan 's seeking out a particular pusher , a two-time loser who bragged around that he would n't be busted a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The two detectives were on a side street just off Lenox Avenue when Sullivan spotted him dealing his bags defiantly out in the open . The pusher ran into a tenement when he saw them and was almost out a rear door when Sullivan cornered him . The frightened Negro 's hand went to his pocket and the detective hit him before the gun could be pulled . He fell back against the door and Sullivan 's hands tightened around his neck in blind , uncontrollable fury . " He 's out , he 's out ! What 's the matter with you ? " Pope cried . " Let him fall ! " He had to pry the fingers away from the unconscious man 's throat . Then Sullivan looked for the gun that would rationalize the rage , but he found none . The pusher had only been going for a cover of money , to try a payoff in his panic . They had finished their tour together in silence . As they came down the precinct steps Sullivan watched his Negro partner walk abruptly , disgustedly away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " how about a drink ? " Incredulously Pope turned and stared . " I want to talk , " the white man added , his face offering an open  | token of friendship that made Bill Pope curious . Their drink turned into a five-hour marathon of talk and whiskey , in the beginning mostly Sullivan 's , as if his dammed-up emotions were suddenly released in a flood of words . Pope could never again file this man away under " racist , " " prejudice , " " hate . " He told him , as best he could , of the angers that consumed him and drove him to flare out , at times blindly , against the excesses that were an affront to his basically puritanical nature , of impulsive acts that he recalled later in shame , then tried unsuccessfully to bury . Of his stevedore father who drank and the discontent and gloom of his mother , which helped put her in an early grave . A high school diploma and military service at eighteen and an anonymous civilian at twenty . Jobs for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and finally it all seemed to smooth out . He had a happy marriage and a family to look forward to , though it took three miscarriages and eight years before their first was born . It was too hard a pregnancy . The doctor told him there should be no more or she might die . It had been an extraordinary monologue , this self-revelation in the booth of a Spanish Harlem bar , Sullivan exposing his trepidations and small victories and the uncertainties that were common to all men . Above all there was the pride , the uncontrollable consuming pride , which he used , at times brutally , to prove he was a man trying his best . It had gained him recognition ? first grade detective . But he knew he would go no higher . Though still in his thirties , he was an anachronism ; the department of the future would shy away from men like him because he barely accepted the changes that had already begun . He talked of throwing in the retirement papers when he did the twenty and getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondered if this violent man could ever retire . He realized Sullivan was an unconscious seeker of trouble and excitement , and would be out of step in a world of middle-class calm . He was a boat rocker , born a hundred years too late , a marshal in a frontier town who should have been locking up drunken cowboys or shooting red men instead of punching contemporary black ones . The ideological chasm rooted in the color of their skin and their backgrounds dictated their approach to life and the job . But the honesty that  | barriers , and Pope 's partnership with Frank Sullivan took on new dimensions thereafter . Their tours in the seamy jungle of whores and pimps , pushers and wasted junkies , petty assaults and hysterical murders passed quickly and soldified them into a team . Slowly Bill Pope began to see the job through his partner 's eyes as somewhat of a dedication . He would n't tell anyone that for fear of their laughing in his face , but he was taught more about police work in that brief span of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taught him . And then Sullivan 's tragedy . Pope went to Queens , to Schaeffer 's Funeral Parlor . He said a prayer over the two caskets lying pathetically side by side . Frank stood lost in the corner of the crowd of mourners , unable to talk or even look up , just barely erect when the priest came in to chant the rosary for the deceased . He took just enough time off to bury his dead , and came quickly back to work , hoping to dull the cutting edge of his grief by routine , to still the accusing voice that tore at him inside . But his anguish and guilt were too consuming and fought for release . Exploding in a rash of violence , he checked off what he felt were the bad niggers and went after them , a self-styled avenger who ran roughshod over everyone . Complaints came across the captain 's desk and the gun started to come out with a frequency that alarmed Pope for his own safety and Frank 's . The climax erupted in the ugly needless shooting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have dumped the average cop into a suspension , or maybe out of a job . But Captain Paul Matthews understood and shielded him , quashing the grumbles with the higher-ups and easing him into a protective thirty-day sick leave . " Lose it in a bottle , take a walk in the woods , or hit your head against a wall , but do n't come back with it , Frank . I wo n't be able to save you again .... " As Eddie the manager talked , Frank 's affable nods and conversation lacked that terrifying tension . Yes , he had control now , Pope thought . His partner was all right , he was going to make it back from his sorrow . The manager , too , realized it was a different Sullivan who had last visited his place , and he dropped the guarded small talk . " This wantin ' to talk to one o ' my girls , it have anything to do  | with what happened earlier tonight ? You know , about the killin 's and Doc Johnson gettin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then at him . He knew he had said the wrong thing . His hands went out in physical apology . " Hey , man , I 'm not pryin ' , it 's just that it 's on everybody 's lips about some cat scorin ' big against Papa Bear . " The buzz of conversation around the bar and tables , punctuated by laughter , blended with the rhythm and blues flowing from the multicolored jukebox , which covered the entertainment break . The manager 's eyes circled around the room , then rested on the full shot glass before him . He lowered his voice . " Some o ' Doc 's men were in to check the house ; they gave it a pretty good lookover . They said Doc 's layin ' out money for information , he 's tryin ' to buy some leads . " He felt uncomfortable under their silent stares and decided it was wise to drop the subject . He lifted his glass . " Well , anyway , here 's luck to ya . " " What else do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Negro 's hand halfway to his mouth . " Not a thing , " he said , and shook his head . " But I wouldn't 've laid big odds nobody coulda ran up a score like that . " The glass continued upward and he drank . " I guess that was why it worked , " Pope said , taking Eddie off the hook . " They did n't think anyone would ever try . " " Man . " The manager looked at Pope . He felt he could express himself better to a fellow black . " The guys that pulled it have to have balls made of cast iron . You know what I mean . Like that money had to be covered like Fort Knox . You got to give them credit . " For a moment his admiration made him forget who he was talking to . " Well , yeah , you know it 's too bad them cats cut down the cops . If they coulda made it without hurtin ' anybody ... like who were they takin ' the money from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They were both staring at him coldly and he vainly tried to dig himself out of the hole . " The guys upstairs , they shouldn't 've been killed , either . It 's only money and no life 's worth that , right ? " Eddie stumbled , trying to smooth it over . His head twisted to the door . " Hey , fresh money . " His tone brightened as he motioned toward the entrance at a party of four just coming in.  | The two men at the door , draped in up-to-the-moment fashion , looked like shiny copper pennies . Sullivan recognized them as numbers runners putting on a front . Their bewigged sleek women were duplicates of the other girls in the room . " You 're goin ' to have to excuse me , boys ; business is exceptionally good tonight . " He did n't bother to finish his drink . " When that gal comes in I 'll send her over . " He turned , happy to leave . " Remind me , Bill , will you ? " Sullivan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Next time I 'm drunk take me in here because I 'd like to shoot this place up just for pleasure and I 'd start off by puttin ' a bullet up our friend Eddie 's ass . " Pope 's mouth curled into a grin and he shook his head slowly . " The hell I will . The next time you go drinking and want some action you 're going to do the scene yourself , because my old , gray-haired Southern mother told me to stay away from drinking white men with guns . " Sullivan snorted an easy laugh . " Well , then , at least help me drink some of Eddie 's private stock . " He tilted the bottle of J &B; and filled their shot glasses . Above them the musicians came back on the bandstand , the slowly turning colored disks reflecting off the dark glasses . The piano player hunched across the keys , leaned into the mike and purred Ellington 's " Sophisticated Lady " with a pleasant huskiness . Sullivan looked at his watch , then glanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show in another fifteen minutes , I think we 're going out to look for her . " " You think The Nightman was putting us straight , or just making up a convenient story ? " Pope asked . " I do n't know . " Frank shrugged . " But it 's the only story we got so far , so we might as well stay with it . " Pope 's fingers worked a cigarette loose from the pack he had thrown on the bar . " Well , one thing : we 're a damn sight better off sitting here drinking free booze than running around pulling in punks and going through the question bit with them back at the station house . " " That 's for sure , " Sullivan said . " The atmosphere 's a lot better here than back in that squad room . " His head motioned to the music . " But I wish that drummer would play a touch softer . "  | The match illuminated Pope 's high-cheekboned face . He exhaled and the smoke rolled up through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we should be thankful for knowing blacks pulled this off . " The music blared over Pope 's voice , making Sullivan incline his head toward him . " If whites ever made the hit , the department could have ended with an unsolvable on their hands . " " What makes you think it still could n't end up that way ? " " No . " Pope shook his head . " Black men with the kind of money they 're holding eventually have to stand out like sore thumbs . Oh , they can be swallowed up for a while ; any good-size city like Washington or Philadelphia or even Newark with their big Negro populations can help lose them just by sheer numbers . But they ca n't stay submerged too long . " Sullivan thought Pope 's judgment was sound , for in most instances blacks would n't have the patience to sit back for any great length of time , and would tend to spend the money a lot more quickly than whites but he felt his partner might be underestimating the perpetrators . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughtfully , " but give the devil his due . I think they 're too sharp to blow this in an insane getaway against a thirteen-state alarm . Even a short run to Newark or Jersey City does n't figure , because what you said about losing themselves in a crowded ghetto is the key and Harlem is made to order for them . Half a million people crowded into six square miles  --  this has to be their best bet , at least for a while . " He wanted to add , So go ahead and find them , but it would have been a lame joke on him as well as Pope and every man on the job . Instead he continued to dissect his young partner 's theories . " And about them bringing suspicion to themselves with a quick itch to spend , I think we can forget it because I agree with Matthews : they did n't plan on killing any cops and that has to make them a lot more cautious in how they behave from here on in . " The fact of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of like lost in an anonymity of blackness , " he said , then thought of the analogy , Like niggers in a coal pile , but he did n't say it . " Maybe this thing will start to crack from within , " Pope added . " They took a lot of money ; what was the rough estimation ,  | four hundred thousand ? How long do you think they can hold that kind of fortune without something giving ? " " I think that 's hoping for a lot , " Sullivan replied . " They 're not about to fight among themselves . The way they went after the money indicates they were willing to sacrifice themselves for it . And we 've got to presume these hard-nosed bastards did n't stop thinking now that they 've succeeded , and each day they hole up makes the odds a little bit better for them . " He seemed to sigh . " So we better enjoy Whitfield 's liquor while we can , because unfortunately I think this is going to take a lot of leg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " That kind of talk makes The Nightman 's story hold up . It sounds like you bought it . " Sullivan shrugged . They became silent , watching the bartender refill their glasses . Under the noise and music , a short , thick-set muscular man had shuffled up and now stood almost on top of them . He pushed his hand into Sullivan 's back . " Hey , man , " he said in a grating voice . The small eyes scowled out from under scarred , fissured brows with the dullness of two unpolished stones . " Hello , Clubby , " Sullivan said amicably . " Where have you been keeping yourself ? " " Who dis guy ? " the squat man asked belligerently , his finger pointing suspiciously at Bill Pope . " This is my new partner , " the detective answered soberly . " Say , I have n't seen you around in months , Clubby . How 've you been doing ? " The man pushed his face in close ; the chipped teeth in front were turning bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this new partner of yours ? Can we talk in front o ' him ? " " Sure , sure we can . " Sullivan glanced at Pope but there was no wink ; his face stayed serious . " You can say anything you want . " The broken face relaxed . " You wan na paper , Frank ? " He whipped out a night edition of the Daily News from the bulky bundle he carried under his arm . " No , thanks , Clubby . " " Yeah . " He spread his legs and shifted his hip into the papers .  | " Yeah , they do n't spend no mother-fuckin ' money on wages down there , baby . I dropped a few of their lousy dishes and dat swank hotel he do n't fire me because he remembers who I was , but I end up polishin ' all them goddamn sheeny shoes . I shine every fuckin ' shoe in that goddamn hotel for one lousy year , man , until I say , No more , no more . Go home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He paused , tongue running over his lumpy lips . " You sure you don ' wan na paper ? " and he pushed one at him . " Here , here , man . I give you a freebie . " " No , Clubby , I do n't ? " " When you goin ' ta lock my manager up , huh ? Last time I see you you say you 're goin ' downtown and lock him up . " " He has n't handled you for a long time . " " I know , man , I know . " His free hand moved a couple of times in front of his face . The eyes rolled back in his head as if he was trying to clear his thoughts . " That white rapin ' bastard . I told ya ? did n't I tell ya ? ? about how he done give me plenty wrong counts when that long green was rollin ' in . He still got my money . He get rich on my dough . You the law , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of days off next week . You want me to lock him up next week , Clubby ? " " Yeah , next week , man . " His head bounced affirmatively . " You know where he hang out , man . Downtown . West Fortyninth Street , with the rest of the fight crowd . " Then he stopped , his eyes blinking in the cavernous sockets made hollow by builtup scar tissue . " But maybe he ai n't around there no more . They say there ai n't no more real fighters , no more action . You know they tear Stillman 's Gym down and there 's no more Garden down there . No more Stillman 's ; like everything 's dead , you know what I mean , man ? " He stood there broodingly for a couple of long seconds , his eyes going to the floor . Then his head popped up . " But he have a business , yeah , somewhere down there , I think , he have a business . Well , it do n't matter , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goin ' ta get that money that 's due me . " He pressed his head in close . " You sure you do n't want a paper ? " Sullivan 's eyes went to the money on the bar and he remembered he was drinking for nothing . His hand dipped into his  | pocket and came up with a couple of singles ; he stuffed them into the ex-fighter 's sweat-stained shirt pocket . " Hey , man , I make out okay . I do n't need no handout . " " Who said you did ? It 's just a loan . " " Well , okay then , okay . Just a loan . " He seemed about to say something more , but he lowered his head , turned and started to shuffle away . Then he stopped and looked back . " You get me in the mornin ' , you hear ? We 'll go downtown together and grab ? " Someone called for a paper . The detectives watched him move down the length of the bar , instinctively slouching foward in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and patted his back as he passed and the smattering of applause for the trio suddenly became explosive greetings from tiered thousands . A match flaring in the shadows of the tables was the hundreds of continually lighting cigarettes fireflying a darkened stadium . He stood down at the other end of the room , a subdued light above his head making him barely visible through the crowd , and the light seemed to intensify into many lights that beat down on his jet sleekness while his manager and seconds hovered about him and people screamed his name . And he stood down at the other end of the bar selling his eight-cent paper for ten cents . " Ten years ago , " Frank Sullivan said reflectively , " he was beautiful . " It was the tight green dress that Bill Pope saw first . She was on the thin side , but the flashy dress swelled and curved in the proper places . She had turned her head , listening intently to Eddie , then , following his quck motion , picked Sullivan out through the dim lights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncertainly for a moment . " We do n't have to wait any longer , " said Pope . " Here she comes now , Frank . " Sullivan turned and watched her approach . There was an outward appearance of calm , but as she came closer he could see concern in the brown eyes . Her nose was maybe a little too wide for the slender face , but her jawline had a delicate firmness that accentuated the full , almost sensuous lips . The straightened hair was n't too long and was pulled back from her face . In the shifting lights of the room , with her sleek hair and her tawny complexion , she looked Oriental .  | " I hear you boys want to talk to me , " she said to Sullivan . Her voice was unruffled . " If your name is Ivy Roberts , " Frank said quietly , " we want to talk to you . " A forced smile touched her lips . " That 's what they call me . " A few people had turned from their conversations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them . Sullivan reached out and pulled an empty stool between Pope and himself and motioned for the girl to sit down . She seemed thankful for the partial obscurity , which made her feel less conspicuous . The detectives watched her open her bag and dig down for cigarettes . Neither man offered her a light ; they watched her fumble for matches and light up . She looked at them , all traces of a smile gone . " You 'll have to excuse me ; it is n't every night I jeopardize my job by talkin ' to cops . I think I 'm goin ' to have to do a lot of explainin ' to Eddie when you boys leave . He do n't like the help being questioned , especially in front of the customers . Bad for business , you know . " She tried to break the constricting mood by an effort at levity . " He thinks he 's running the Copacabana . " It did n't work . They stayed coolly expressionless and she looked at the white detective . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the club and put a couple of bullets into a man and pegged shots about the room , but she knew all about him . Rumors floated about that the shooting was tied to some kind of payoff , and he had coldly tried to kill the man before he could talk and expose him . " If you 're clean , baby , in whatever he 's gon na question you about , " Eddie had said to her , " you get that bastard out o ' here fast ; I do n't want him around here . But if he 's got you for somethin ' , you go quiet , and do n't try askin ' for no help from somebody at this bar . You understand what I 'm sayin ? " She studied the inflexible face ; his guarded eyes offered no key to his feelings . Dropping her gaze , she took a long drag on the cigarette . " Okay , what can I do for you , mister ? " " We want to talk to you about your boyfriend , Jim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her brow furrowed into a question and she looked up . " My boyfriend ? Mister , you got the wrong girl . "  | " I 'll ask you again , only this time we want a straight answer . " Sullivan did n't raise his voice . " Now wait a minute , fellas , please . " Her hands inched above the bar , palms held out loosely in a stop signal . " Let 's slow it down , huh ? You 're goin ' a little too fast for me because , if I remember correctly , that boy is doin ' time and if he broke out of jail he sure enough did n't come running to little of Ivy to hide him , I can guarantee you that . " Sullivan and Pope looked at each other . " How do you know he was serving time ? " Bill Pope said it as if it were a casual question , but it came at Ivy like a loaded hose . She looked at him really for the first time and was surprised to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't work in a place like this without knowin ' what 's goin ' on . Every racket man , big and small , makes the scene here one time or another and they talk shop . Like who 's strung out and which is the latest cat to be busted . You know , things like that . And that 's how I hear about Jim Harris . " From their inquisitive stares she knew they were far from satisfied with her answer . She would have liked to leave it like that , for it touched a period in her life she felt was no one 's business but her own , but they were The Men , and she knew she had better answer their questioning silence . She took another long drag on the cigarette as though gathering her thoughts . The exhaled smoke rose slowly above her head . " Look , I wo n't deny Jim Harris took me out a few times . Any one of the girls around here will tell you that . But that was about a year and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was no fight or anything like that ; he just stopped comin ' around the club and that was the end of it . Just passin ' time ; a few laughs , you know , nothin ' serious . It was a little while after that I hear he got messed up with the law and got sent away . " She tilted her head toward Pope and shrugged . " And that was the end of Jimmy Harris as far as my life was concerned , until you two mentioned his name now . It was like a long time ago . " " We hear he 's back on the street and was seen about a month ago , and this was told to us by the same person who said you were his girl . " Pope spoke slowly , watching her eyes for a response ,  | but there was only a firmness that helped attest to her denial . " Well , I ca n't help what you hear , but if somebody says they seen him with me in the last month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they 're puttin ' you on . Why they mention my name with his now I sure enough do n't know . But it 's playin ' a lousy trick on me , I can tell you that . " Pope looked at Sullivan . Pope felt she was telling the truth but he avoided saying anything , lest he might have misread something in her words or mannerisms that Frank 's greater experience could detect and now would use against her . Ivy Roberts became awkwardly aware of the white detective 's steady gaze . She wanted to turn to him , stare him down , shout her fear and embarrassment and frustration out for everyone to hear : You got nothin ' on me , cop ; leave me alone , just leave me be ! But she could combat it only by riveting her gaze on the trio softly carrying the beat of the music through the room . " You 're sticking with that story , honey ? " Sullivan 's flat voice forced her to turn around . " If you take me in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can only repeat to you what I already told you : he was just a guy I dated a few times and then it was over . And I have nothin ' to add to it because what I said is the truth and I think you two know it . " The music and talk and sound of laughter ceased , shut out of her mind by Sullivan 's intense skepticism . " Are you goin ' to take me in ? " she asked in a voice that might have been a child 's . He shook his head . " No , no , I 'm not , " he said , and turned and motioned to the bartender with his thumb and forefinger , indicating that a shot glass be put in front of the girl . She did n't show the relief she felt . She had never been locked up before but she knew girls who had been and the booking , fingerprinting and legal arraignment seemed a humiliating and revolting thing to go through . She waited until the bartender moved away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence . " What 's Harris done ? " she asked , and caught the look that passed between the detectives . " Hey , if I 'm out of bounds just forget I asked . It 's just that I got to be curious , seein ' that  | I 'm bein ' questioned about him . And besides , I just do n't feel like makin ' up no story for Eddie , ' cause I 'm gon na get that question myself after you guys leave and I 'm goin ' to have to give him some kind of a straight answer . " " Maybe nothing , " Pope said , " or maybe he was in on a robbery tonight that involved a lot of money and a number of people being killed . This guy Harris could be clean , but until we find out , he 's a suspect . " Her hand picked up the drink . Some of it spilled over the top and ran down her fingers . " There , you see . " Her lips went into a quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook me up . Well , I sure earned this . " She nodded and drank it down . " What kind of guy is this Harris ? " Sullivan asked casually as he poured out another drink for her . " Oh , the usual type that comes in here . Flashy dresser , swinger with more loot than the average uptown cat . " She paused , her head imperceptibly going to the crowd of welldressed blacks spaced around the bar . A couple of stools away , a diamond pinky ring caught the spray of changing light , gleaming while it rode up with the other fingers wrapped around a tall glass of gin and tonic . " But I wan na tell you , " she said coldly , " they buy you a drink and even though they know you 're shillin ' for the house they think they own you . After a couple o ' drinks they 're grabbin ' your thigh and tellin ' ya what great big successful men they are . And the ones that ai n't sure they goin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head by the end of the week , they start talkin ' about the day they goin ' ta break through and they 're gon na remember me when they get on top . " She snorted , a jaded sarcastic laugh . Sullivan contemplated his drink to cover the surprise of her unexpected frankness . It was a putdown he rarely heard , as if she forgot for the moment they were the law and that she spoke in front of a white man . But he was cognizant of her anger and embarrassment and the degradation of being questioned , of what she felt to be an indictment of the hustle she worked , and she seemed to be reaching for a public assertion of self-respect that under normal conditions she would have kept to herself . " What about Harris ? " Bill Pope asked . " Was he like that , too ,  | a would-be big man who thought he knew all the answers ? " " No , " she said softly , her fingers making abstract designs in the spilled liquor . " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was one of the reasons I went out with him . Oh , he talked about doin ' big-time things , you know , like everybody else . But it was kind of a cool approach , like he really was goin ' to make it , maybe in the straight world . " She looked at Pope and shrugged . " Oh , I knew he was somewhere in the rackets . It seems like half the guys uptown got something illegal goin ' for themselves , and I guess if they did n't they would n't eat . You accept it . It 's a way of life . I guess you know what I mean . " The changing light coming off the bandstand caught her eyes , reflecting her somber tone . " Yeah , maybe that 's the real reason I dated him ; maybe I believed he could do what he said and I could ride out with him into a world he talked about . But nothin 's lastin ' with me . When we stopped datin ' it was him that ended it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , so the hell with him . " Frank Sullivan listened quietly . Given the nature of his calling , people generally went to the other extreme . But now he felt that he had caught her in one of the rare moments of self-revelation that people permit themselves . Like a stranger sitting beside you on a bus , unexpectedly telling you intimate details of his life and his problems , talking to you as if you were a cherished old friend , then , a few stops farther along , getting off and disappearing into a crowd , never to be seen again . In this loquacious mood she warranted one more question . " Do you think this Harris is smart enough to plan a big robbery and have the guts to pull it off ? " he asked . She turned to him . " Oh , he 's sharp enough to do a lot of things , but if you 're askin ' if he 's capable of killin ' somebody to get what he wanted " ? she stopped as though running the question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I really do n't know . That 's a kind of loaded question I just ai n't able to answer . I 'm not runnin ' away from an answer , mister ; it 's just that I was n't around him that much to make a guess on somethin ' as deep as that . " The drummer rolled a sudden beat of attention , the rotating gels gave way to a white spot coming out of a darkened corner ,  | and the piano player leaned into the mike . " Ladies and gentlemen , the Club 7-11 proudly presents , direct from her successful Baltimore engagement ... " Ivy 's voice could barely be heard above the amplified introduction and the detectives bent their heads down to her . " Maybe I can help you boys out , " she said . " He has a sister who plays piano for the church of Preacher Gregory . It 's the Tabernacle of Moses over on Lenox . " She stopped , her soft brown eyes apologetic . " I know it ai n't much , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot glass from the bar , dipping it toward them in a brief toast ? " I wish you boys rich " ? then continued it on up to her lips .  | " Rufus , " the high-pitched voice yelled , the squat body leaning over the bar . " Hey , you , Rufus . Goddammit , man , hear me . " Sweat rolled down the black face . " What 's that mother , he deef or somethin ' ? " he asked the four people crowded around him . He called again , and this time his voice carried and caught the bartender 's attention . " Hey , man , come on . " His hand waved above the empty glasses . " Hit us again , will ya ? " Henry Jackson turned back to his party . His protruding eyes were glazed by liquor , while his head moved to the recorded beat of the jukebox as it banged out along the length of the whiskey-smelling room . Here the men pressed against the bar shunned Edwardian jackets and Italian silks in favor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women , some standing , some sitting on the worn wooden stools , wore the bargain-basement specials of Madame K 's on the Square ; their hair was unstraightened , not because of a defiant pride in their Afro heritage , but mainly because of the scarcity of money . The music bounced off a wall that needed a paint job , off the back of the bar , vibrating and weaving between the rows of glasses and the bottled lineup of Schenley and Carstairs and Dixie Belle gin . The voice on the record was singing an up tune ; it was their song and they knew it . The night was trying to forget the long hard day . Here there was no need to force the laughter ; it came easy and natural and the talk was  | honest . In this bar they were among their own . " You sure a goer tonight , Henry , " the big-busted brown girl said . She sat on a bar stool , her legs crossed , the miniskirt showing generous thighs . " Where you get all this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a derisive grin and she glanced at the other girl sitting on a stool beside her and at the two men standing with Henry , letting them all enjoy her open tease . " You hit a number today , baby , or you jump some rich of gray or somethin ' ? " " Maybe he usin ' bad dice in a good crap game , " the tall , dark girl on the other stool said , and they all smiled . Henry had his back to the bar and was enjoying the jesting attention . He bent forward , his hands grabbing the waist of the abundant brown girl who led the ribbing . " Laurelene , honey " ? he pushed his face close to hers ? " you better be nice to me , because Henry 's through bein ' a pauper . From now on things are goin ' to be silk an ' satin , baby , you hear ? From now on all you people " his head went in the direction of the two men ? " are goin ' to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fresh round of drinks , reached for the money one of the other men had laid on the bar . Henry spun around . " Hey , Rufus , do n't you touch George 's money ; it 's no good here . This here is my round . " His arms swept out importantly , pushing a couple of bills from his own change before him on the bar , and he capped his generosity by adding a tip . " Keep the change , man . " Rufus the bartender took the money and stood there smiling . He seemed about to say something , then shook his head amusedly and walked away to ring it up in the register . " If this is the new man you gon na be , Henry , " Laurelene said , her eyes wide with exaggerated awe , " you sure gon na find a lotta new friends quick . You 're gon na end up the black pied piper of Harlem and all them drinkin ' people are gon na point you out and say , There he go , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scoff with a smile and reached out to snuggle around Jackson 's neck , while the others laughed . Henry had laid himself open to their ridicule . They had been drinking together for the last hour . As one quick drink led to another , Jackson 's restrained jubilation in his new-found wealth had slowly seeped  | out in boastfulness about a happy future , guarded at first , then expanding in defense against Laurelene 's good-natured needling . The tall , yellow-skinned man standing next to her smiled . He had been masking his annoyance at Jackson 's expansiveness ; since he was drinking on him he would let the phony mouthings pass . But as the rounds continued to flow , Henry started to grab for the big-titted girl and it churned the man 's irritations still more . Now he decided to puncture Jackson 's bullshit balloon , cut him down to size . " Now , Laurie , baby , you go easy on Henry , " he said , the smile never leaving his face . " His old woman she gon na be hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she finds out he 's throwin ' more money across the bar than he more than likely gave her in the last month . So I think we better let him finish his drink and go on home , ' cause I do n't wan na be no part of breakin ' up no marriage . " Jackson looked up at him , his eyes narrowing in anger . He did n't mind Laurelene 's ribbing ; in fact he found the backhanded attention she gave him flattering . But he had just enough drink in him to resent the man 's chafing sarcasm . He rode up on his toes to gain some height . " Well , I 'll tell you , man , I do n't have to push no goddamn clothes rack through that downtown Jew garment district for my bread like some cats I know . And I ai n't boot-lickin ' some white man for shit money either . I make mine by usin ' my brains . " The other man in their party shook his head and gently touched Jackson 's back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go and get mad for , Henry . Cass do n't mean nothin ' , he just havin ' some fun . We all just havin ' some fun and nothin ' serious meant . We 're all friends here just tryin ' to enjoy ourselves . " Henry held his belligerent stance , his boozy eyes glaring at Cass . " Well , I do n't like bein ' made no fool of , man . Them days is gone , too , along with a lotta other shit in my life , ' cause I do n't have to take it no more . " He turned and looked disdainfully at the four of them bunched in tight around him . " And I do n't give no good goddamn , you believe me or not , because action speaks  | louder than words . You 'll see . You all see soon enough what I 'm talkin ' about . " He reached out against their silence for his glass and gulped it with righteous indignation . The song on the jukebox ended . Talk and light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four people crowded around Henry were momentarily silenced by his words , their thoughts so similar that they might have been reading one another 's minds . They all knew Henry to be a quick squanderer of paychecks from a long list of menial jobs that he now scornfully denounced . They had heard his empty optimistic talk of a fanciful dream world of plenty many times before , but never before had it had quite such boisterous conviction . It was against the familiar tedium of his tall tales that they had aligned their whimsical putdown , but this time , unlike most kidding , it drew no line in its roughness and slopped over the boundaries of mockery into raw meanness . Laurelene 's eyes fell on the remnants of Henry 's twenty lying on the bar . She was having too good a time to let go this easily and she moved to keep the party going . " Hey , Henry . " The skirt slid further up the brown legs , holding for a long second at her crotch , then slowly she got off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some songs and add some life to this dead-ass party ? " She laughed and her arms went around his neck . Jackson had been pacified by what he considered their respectful silence . He smiled back at her , then scooped some change off the bar and stuffed it into her hands . " Yeah , baby , you load that money-grabbin ' music box while I become the middleman with the men 's room in the back . " " Now , Henry " ? her face became serious ? " do n't you go and fall in because I ca n't save ya , I do n't know how to swim . " Jackson swept his arms about the girl and they bent to fresh laughter . Then he eased out of the tight circle . " Hey , if you get that lazy-movin ' Rufus ' eye , order another round and I 'll be right back . And if I 'm not , then you know I blew my bladder on the way . " Joe Logart also stepped away from the bar . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nursing a drink in apprehensive silence as he listened to Jackson 's building braggadocio.  | It was empty in the darkened rear , by the toilets , and he waited in a booth . As Henry strutted past him Logart grabbed his arm and stood up , blocking the narrow passageway . " Henry ' let 's get the hell out of here , huh , it 's too ? " Jackson pulled his arm away with a quick flash of anger . Joe Logart might have been a stranger . " Hey , man , do n't you touch me . I do n't like bein ' pushed , you hear ? " The sudden bluster stunned Logart . He stared at Jackson , studying the protruding drink-blurred eyes . He was n't surprised that Henry had momentarily forgotten about him , for after he had been introduced at the bar he drifted to the fringe of the party , staying just close enough to hear the talk , mindful of the unpredictable personality of the drinking Jackson . " I 'm not pushing you , Henry , " Logart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of here . You know what I mean , man , like we should n't be here this long . Come on , let 's go . If you wan na drink more , I 'll buy a bottle and we 'll drink up in my hotel room , okay ? " Jackson , mollified , shook his head sadly at what he felt was unnecessary concern . " What you frettin ' about , Joe ? Everybody know me here . I 'm among friends . The trouble with you is you do n't know how to relax . Come on , man , join the party and let 's have some laughs . " He leaned closer and lowered his voice , as if to impart a secret . " Look , Joe , we could push them two cats out . I know them two guys and they 're nothin ' . It 'll be easy to grab their cunt for ourselves . That Laurelene chick , man , she 'll blow your mind . But you got to join the fun and spend a few bucks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then we 'll have these bitches made real quick . " " I 'll have my laughs , man , but not here . " Edginess crept into Logart 's tone . " No , you finish your drink , Henry , kiss these people off and let 's get movin ' . " Jackson could sense the anger behind Logart 's surface calm . In the short time they had been thrown together he had taken a strong liking to this quiet man . Even though they would be parting after taking their shares , in all probability never to see each other again , he did n't want to end their friendship on a sour note over something he considered merely foolish overcautiousness.  | His hand went up to Logart 's shoulder . " Joey , you the biggest worrier I ever did see . We all got away nice and easy and that got ta be the toughest part of the whole bit . You listen to me now when I tell you you got ta stop seein ' the gloomy side . Jim Harris , maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a record . But we , we should be celebratin ' . " He closed his eyes for a moment , his head swaying as if to some rhythm only he could hear . " Man , man , " he drawled with a grin of delight , his thoughts vicariously reliving the earlier excitement , " we showed them all tonight . Did n't we , Joey ? You and me and Jimbo . " The smile widened and he could barely control the laughter . " And , Joey , you know what the best thing is , the best thing of all : The cops ai n't goin ' to tie me into it . They do n't have a sheet on me , man . I never been locked up in my life so I do n't even have to worry about the fuzz . I wo n't even be pulled in for questionin ' . " His laughter bubbled up and he began to rock gently to its gratifying pleasure . Logart wanted to shake him , to rattle the crazy optimism from his liquor-addled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fog that seemed to be carrying him further out of reach . Disgust smeared across Logart 's scarred face , his mouth twisted ironically . " Henry , I 'm from outa town and I 'm clean with the law , too . But I 'm still worried about them . " The heavy beat of recorded music began to pulse up from near the entrance to the bar . " But I 'm not half as afraid of them as I am about Doc Johnson if half the stories I heard about him are true . And knowin ' all the cats he got workin ' for him up there , he got to be a bigger danger to us than the law . So why buck the odds , man ? In a couple o ' days we 'll be outa here , so let 's lay low like Jimbo says . " Henry Jackson straightened up to his full height , his eyes fixed on Logart , the laughter replaced by quicksilver anger . " They can come lookin ' for me , every last goddamn one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patting the gun stuck into his waistband beneath the jacket . " I 'm packin ' this here piece and if any of them boys of Johnson 's comes a-callin ' , I 'll shoot their mother-fuckin ' eyes out . You hear me , man ? None of them bastards scare me . None of them . "  | Then they both were quiet , watching a burly man in work clothes squeeze past them to the gray door that hid the privy from the patrons . Insistent beats and talk and laughter filled the gin mill with a gaiety that was jarring to Joe Logart 's mounting nervousness . Drink had transformed the docile Jackson into a schizo ready to fight the whole damn world . " Henry , you got ta listen to me , and listen to me good . Do you wan na jeopardize everythin ' we knocked our brains out for ? " Logart appealed to him in a firm , even tone . " It 's not only yourself to think about , it 's me and Jimbo and all the sweat and strain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we crossed the finish line big winners , the race still ai n't over with , ' cause there 's too many guys that want to put a claim against us and they still got the power to make us losers , Henry . " He softened his voice . " All them good things we talk about , man , they all up front waitin ' to be enjoyed . Good days ahead with enough money to buy all the women and laughs you want . You know what I mean , man ? But tonight ai n't one of them . So do n't you blow this thing , baby , not now . " Jackson listened and he remembered Logart 's eyes having almost the same look when they gazed hauntingly above the money in Jim Harris 's apartment an hour or two before . " I do n't agree with your thinkin ' , Joe , " he answered slowly , " but like you say , I got ta consider you and Jim . If for no other reason , man , than that big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Okay . " He nodded in agreement . " Okay , you can relax , man . I 'll have that final drink with my friends and I 'll go with ya . " He buttoned the top of the jacket , then brushed his hand back over his hair . " Besides , I got too many things to straighten out than to be wastin ' my time around this here dump . But you do me one favor right now , okay ? You stop your worryin ' . Everything 's all right , Joe , you know . And that 's the way it 's goin ' to stay . " They left the toilet and went out , to be met by Laurelene , who had hipped her way from the crowd up front . " Hi , honey , " she said , sliding in between them , her arms going about Henry , her wide mouth parting in a smile . " I was beginnin ' to think maybe you really drowned . We got a drink waitin ' for you . What 's takin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to  | Logart ; from their silence she sensed an argument . " What 's the matter with your friend here , Henry ? He antisocial or somethin ' , or maybe he afraid of women ? " " No , baby . " Jackson winked at Logart . " He not afraid of women , he just a worrier . " She tilted her head , her round face exaggerating the question . " He a what ? " " A worrier . You know , like the atom bomb that ai n't ever goin ' to drop . " Her eyes narrowed suspiciously as she looked for the joke . She glanced quietly at the unsmiling Logart and then at Jackson , and grew annoyed because she could n't see the humor . " Now do n't you try and get deep and mysterious with me , Henry . That ai n't your style . If your friend is a drag , let him stay by himself , but you got a drink on the bar that 's paid for and that music fillin ' this here joint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up front and enjoy it . " She took him by the hand . " Come on now , no more serious talk . That the surest way to break up a good time . " Jackson , delighted by her exaggerated attentiveness , winked again at Logart as his hand slipped around her waist and nestled up under her tit . Near the jukebox a couple had picked up the infectious sounds and begun an improvised dance . A few people turned from their drinks and grinningly encouraged them . " I can do better than that black bitch , " Laurelene said back at the bar , prodded by the liquor . " You sure can , baby , " Jackson answered absently , still caught up in what Logart had told him . He laid his finished drink on the bar with finality , straightened up and looked toward Logart to let him know they were leaving . " Well , then , let 's both show them , eh , Henry ? Let 's show them what we both can do . " She grabbed his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ danced . " No , baby , I got ta cut out , I got things ? " " Come on now , Henry . I need a partner . " " Here . " He motioned to the man beside him . " Here 's Cass ; he dance with you . " " I do n't wan na dance with Cass , I wan na dance with you , " and she dragged playfully at him .  | " Hey , you , mama ! " Her voice threw its husky sarcastic challenge over to the other girl and twisted heads along the length of the crowded bar . " You move your black hide out of the way because I 'm goin ' to show you how it 's really done . " She turned to Jackson . " You ready , honey ? " A silly , uncomfortable grin went across his heavy lips . " Well , baby , I . . . " The whole place seemed to be staring at him in anticipation . " Are you gon na dance with me , Henry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' to turn queer or somethin ' ? " A few people started to laugh . " Okay , Laurie , " Henry said , accepting the dare . " If you wan na dance , I 'm with you . " She stepped into the thumping music , her hips snaking into erotic rhythms that brought hot smiles to the line of watchers . Liquor had stripped her inhibitions , letting impulse drive her body to the sensual solo of a wailing trumpet . Henry 's ponderous dancing , as he tried to follow her , brought sweat out on his brow and it rolled down his face . The flashing neon in the window of the bar vibrated from the cadence of clapping hands as the aroused audience goaded them on . She moved in a small circle , perspiration running down each side of her body from the sweating patches of hair beneath her uplifted arms . Grinding lustfully , she thrust her body at Henry , pressing almost against but never touching him , and throbbed the closing beats in a climactic ending , and they fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applause . " Come on , baby , give us a second helpin ' o ' that . " " Sock it to us , baby . " " Yeah , an encore , mama , give us some more ! " Laurelene , her dress hugging her sweating body and her bosom heaving , raised her hand for silence . " Boys , if I give you two treatments o ' that , you stalkers would n't let me outa here alive . " The bar roared with laughter and Henry Jackson felt inches taller as he swaggered back with her arm in arm to their own waiting party . " Hey , Rufus , " Jackson called impatiently , " set up a round of drinks here . "  | " Take it easy dancin ' , man , " Cass said , ridicule in his voice , for he was still smoldering from their earlier exchange . " What the big rush for , boy ? We still got some . " He raised his almost filled glass . Henry did a slow theatrical turn and stared pompously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't ask you to buy , did I ? And when I do that 'll be the day . " He cocked his head toward the bartender , who stood , arms folded , amusement on his face , enjoying Henry 's stagy manner . " Rufus , you back up a round for them because this is my last one ; I 'm cuttin ' out . " " Hey , where you goin ' , honey ? " Laurelene protested . " It 's plenty early yet , the night 's too young to end it now . " " I got some important things to do , baby . I got a lotta things to square away . " Rufus had n't responded . He held an old tab of Jackson 's that he had written off to experience and now he did n't feel like starting a repeat performance . Congeniality disappeared from his face as his eyes dropped down to Jackson 's money on the bar . There was only change left . " What you tryin ' to tell me , man ? " Henry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deadbeat . It was degrading , especially in front of Laurelene . " You sayin ' like I ca n't cover it , is that what you tryin ' to tell these people ? " He dug into his pockets and came up with a roll of bills flashing in his hand . He peeled off three twenties and threw them angrily on the bar . " And when you finish gettin ' our drinks you just keep on servin ' , bartender , ' cause I 'm goin ' to do somethin ' you never do in this dump . I 'm buyin ' the house a drink . And if any of these people jump from beer to the hard stuff , you still serve them , " Jackson added nastily , going for the overkill with a flourish . " ' Cause most of these people that keep you in business are my friends . And friendship is somethin ' you know nothin ' about . " He slowly creased the money in his hand , studiedly , conspicuously placing it back in his pocket . " Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I 'm hurryin ' , Henry . " Rufus gave a grin to the others as he turned to fill the orders . " I 'm hurryin ' . " Laurelene raised her brow exaggeratedly at the girl beside her  | and motioned admiringly at Henry . " There 's nothin ' tight about him ; when he got it , he swing . " She looked around her . " There 's no tomorrow with Henry , that 's what I always say about him . He goes for the moment . He know how to live , ' cause he know how to spend . And that 's a real indication what a man is , is what he do with money . " The conviction in her voice dug deeper into Cass 's irritation . Jackson lit a cigarette and blew the smoke importantly toward the ceiling , awash in the enjoyment of what he felt was a big-time display of style . " This is just openers , Laurie , " Henry said , catching a corner of his own reflection distorted in the mirror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw and stopped a second to admire it . " Yeah , honey , this is just the beginnin ' . But I 'm goin ' to be concernin ' myself about the tomorrows comin ' up because I 'm going to be operatin ' my own business pretty soon . " Cass did n't like Henry with money , particularly when he had none himself . The ten that he had put on the bar when they came in was safely folded away back in his pocket , keeping company with a lonely single . He was losing out , and he wanted to salvage his prestige along with the bed he was hoping to share with Laurelene . " What kind of business you think you goin ' into , Henry ? " he said , baiting the trap with a smile . " A business like this , " Jackson answered , his hand going in a grand sweep about him , " only a bigger and nicer place than this that 's kinda well-established with a good spendin ' crowd of steadies . You know , somethin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Rufus happily hustled the drinks along the span of the bar , motioning to Henry as the benefactor of it all . A few drinkers , after they received his gift round , raised their glasses in his direction . Henry acknowledged them like a bored philanthropist . He picked up his own drink , tilted back his head , glassy eyes rolling to the gray tin ceiling , and swallowed his whiskey neat . He laid the shot glass down with a finality that seemed to signify an exit . " That 's nice , " Cass said , " because it take a smart man to own a gin mill like that . But you ai n't it , because a business like that gon na cost more than you ever gon na see in your whole life . " He  | shook his head sadly . " I sure like to know what you 're smokin ' there , Henry , that can fill your mouth with so much bullshit . " The ridicule jabbed into Jackson 's alcohol-swollen ego and he glared furiously at Cass . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hung there , exposing a mouthful of bad teeth . But , somehow , he checked the rush of anger , the corner of his mouth twisted up , and he closed one eye in a drunken blink that he thought conveyed his mysterious , important message . " Man , I got it , " he snarled . " I got all the money I need right now to buy anything I want and that includes buyin ' and sellin ' the likes of you . " Joe Logart had moved up from his half-concealed place at the bar when he had seen Jackson finish his drink . He stood now just behind a lean dark girl and her boyfriend and flinched at Henry 's boast . He signaled with his head to the door but Jackson was too preoccupied with his punctured dignity to see the motion . " Now , Cass , you stop ridin ' Henry , " Laurelene said . She did n't believe him either , but she had jumped to Jackson 's side and was trying to ingratiate herself , eager for some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry 's pocket . " Honey , when you get this place you talkin about " ? she smiled " you gon na let us drink for nothin ' ? " " Yeah , baby , I 'll let you drink all you want and wo n't charge you a dime , but you 're goin ' to need carfare to travel for it . I 'm buying that bar in Chicago . " Logart took a conspicuous step back , his anxious gaze seeking Jackson 's . They caught and Joe 's raised hand beckoned to the street , but Henry , drunkenly determined to leave big , pulled his eyes away and reached for a fresh drink that somebody had sent to him in reciprocation . " Now wait a minute , baby , " Cass said to Laurelene , the booze starting to slur his words . " I 'm not ridin ' him . " A caustic smirk crossed his face . " Maybe of Henry here did catch ahold a somethin ' big . Maybe one of them rich relatives of his drop dead down in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ golden plow and he gon na exchange it for a big fortune . " The other couple laughed and even Laurelene smiled , as Jackson swallowed the drink in fuming silence .  | " Henry . " Joe Logart 's imperative voice turned the four of them around and they stared in surprise at the strained , intent face . They had forgotten about him . " You comin ' with me , man ? " His tone was almost a plea . " Let 's go , huh ? You have your drink , let 's get out of here . " " Man , you stop buggin ' me , " Jackson snapped , his temper now blinding him to the undercurrent in Logart 's words . " I 'm goin ' when I feel like goin ' and that ai n't now . If you wan na leave , go ahead , go ahead . You do n't need me to protect ya . " Cass could see he had him at last and he began to turn the stiletto of his mockery deep into Henry 's exposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girls , for his flashing the roll of bills and buying the house . And for that last eleven dollars in his own pocket . " All I 'm sayin ' , Laurie , is who 's this boy tryin ' to put on ? " He spoke to the girl but kept his scowling gaze on Jackson . " Because we all know this tomcat 's nothin ' but a gang of shit . If his old lady did n't get the welfare checks the first and fifteenth of every month they 'd all be sleepin ' in the street . " Jackson 's temples throbbed , his eyes narrowed against the smoke rising from the cigarette hanging in the corner of his mouth , as he thrust his face up to Cass . " I 'm going to tell you somethin ' , boy , and I do n't give a good goddamn if you believe me or not . " The intensity in his voice made some people turn and stare at him . " You could n't count how much money I got comin ' to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more sudden gold than you ever gon na see in your stinkin ' life . So big , I wo n't ever have to bother with a boot-lickin ' nigger like you no more . " Joe Logart turned , trying to get away from the high-pitched drawling voice , but it pursued him along the bar , came over the heads of the people , followed him through the door and chased him down the street .  | " The man is sapped with the booze , like his brains are comin ' out of his mouth . I tried to talk to him , honest to God , man , I tried to tell him . But he just do n't wan na listen . He too wrapped up in actin ' big man and tryin ' to make some funky bitch of a whore . " Logart stood in the middle of the rotting oilcloth floor , his words tumbling out under the jaundiced light twisted into the kitchen ceiling . The tattered shade was still pulled down , dishes cluttered the sink as before , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money was now piled back into the duffel bag . " Jimbo , you should 've seen him getting drunker by the minute , struttin ' and dancin ' and big-mouthin ' it , and I could n't believe it when he brought out the whole roll of money you gave him and bought the bar a round of drinks , then standin ' there acceptin ' the thank yous . " Jim Harris 's body felt unhinged . The fingers of his hands started to twitch . He stuffed them into his pockets so they would n't be noticed , and lowered his eyes so Logart would n't see what was taking place inside him . " About the job . " His voice was hoarse , almost indistinct . " Did he say anything about the job ? " " He 's drunk , but not that drunk , " Logart answered quickly . " But if he gon na stay there , I would n't bet against it . He liable to say anything that come into his head . " Harris eased his breath out and put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head and closed his eyes and wished he could close off the sound of Joe Logarth 's fright just as easily . It was all falling apart about him : the cops , the unexpected cops appearing out of nowhere in the hall , who had made him throw away a timetable of escape that had taken months of thoughtful planning , that was supposed to leave a route open that he could travel . And now a drunken Henry Jackson , who had stayed so beautifully sober up to then and who was so essential to the scheme , was forcing him to make another unanticipated change . It was too soon , too soon . Doubt gnawed away in the back of his mind , devouring his confidence , leaving anxiety and anger . " I 'm sorry , Jim , I just could n't help it , " Logart said regretfully . " He got away from me , I could n't get him back . It 's not that I did n't try . I did every " Harris whirled around in a rage . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? " The cords of his neck bunched and throbbed . " I ask you to watch him , to make sure he do n't give us any kind of unnecessary trouble , and you come runnin ' back here to me like some kid cryin ' he was too much to keep an eye on . " He turned back to the table , grabbed the duffel bag of money , and held it up in front of Logart 's face . " This is my whole life , my whole future , and it 's yours , too . I planned this mother fucker for over a year , I put it together like a clock that ai n't goin ' to ring any alarms without me knowin ' about it , and the whole fuckin ' thing worked , you hear , it worked . And now you tell me that lousy lush is blowin ' it on me . " He turned and flung the canvas bag back toward the table ; it hit the wall and fell to the floor , scattering some bills . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lousy thirty-six hours more , another day and a half , that 's all I need . And now I got a new worry that 's bigger than the cops and Johnson put together . " A shock of sickness cut across Logart 's stomach . " Take it easy , will ya , Jimbo ? I 'll tell ya what happened and then you tell me if I did wrong , okay ? " Logart 's words tumbled out in a rush of justification . " It was one of them happenin 's that just built outa nothin ' . We were walkin ' over to his pad , and we get to his neighborhood , and as we pass this bar a cab pulls up and two guys get out with a couple o ' chicks . One of the bitches gives him  | a big hello and asks how come they have n't seen him around lately . Well , he starts to strut  --  you know how he is , man , like the way he was actin ' up here before  --  and then he tells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Harris grimaced . " The way you look is just the way I felt , Jimbo , ' cause I 'm standin ' there not knowin ' what to do . Then they invite him in for a drink and he shakes them off but they start kiddin ' around with him , you know , like they 're goin ' ta carry him into the place no matter what . That 's when I stepped time I 'm talkin ' he 's eyein ' up this big , fine-lookin ' bitch . He musta had just enough juice sloshin ' inside him that he could n't resist their invite . He turns to me and says , Let 's have one drink , ' but he was n't askin ' , ' cause in he goes without waitin ' for an answer , leavin ' me standin ' in the street . " " You shouldn't 've let him go in there . You shoulda laid the little bastard out and thrown him in a cab and carried him back up here . " " How the hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a sigh and his hands went out for understanding . " I do n't know this cat that long for me to know how he was goin ' ta act inside , and besides , it woulda looked crazy if I did , with the street so crowded , people hangin ' around outside . I did n't want a big commotion goin ' on . When he walked in there I think he have one , maybe two drinks and we 'd be on our way , nice and quiet like . So do n't blame me for losin ' him ; I do n't deserve it ' cause I never seen that cat drunk before . I did n't know how he gon na behave . If I had any idea how he was goin ' to act , he wouldn't 've got mixed up with no people in any bar . " Joe Logart 's face was a combination of resentment and concern . There was nothing he could add and now he stared unblinkingly back at Harris . Between the walls loose plaster fell , nudged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laugh sounded across the courtyard and Harris 's face , rigid in accusation a moment before , softened in thought . Harris sighed . " Yeah , you 're so right , Joe , you ai n't to blame . It 's my fault , not yours . I should n't of gave him money . But I could n't very well give money to you without givin ' some to him  | because he woulda got suspicious . I  --  I thought it would be safe , it would look natural and be a good cover . The trouble is I figured him too fine ; he 's comin ' on too soon . " " What you mean ? " Logart asked , perplexed , watching Harris bend down to the overturned bag and pick up the scattered money . He put it absently back into the duffel bag , and replaced it on the table . Then he slumped tiredly into a chair . " He 's our patsy , Joe , " he said softly . " Huh ? Patsy ? What the hell you talkin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " How long do you think it 's goin ' to take Doc Johnson to put this thing together and figure out it was me that engineered this hit tonight ? " Logart was confused by Harris 's apparent lack of concern as he asked the frightening , foolish question . " Well , I 'll tell ya , " he groped , " I 'll tell ya how long  --  like maybe never . And if he do put a fix on you , it 'll still be enough time for us to be long gone from here that it do n't really matter . " " Maybe , " Harris said , then shook his head , " but I do n't think so . Doc Johnson 's a sharp man . He might even have me pegged right now . " It was said too casually ; it was like a throwaway surely not to be taken seriously , and Logart searched for a sign of humor on the somber face . But all he could see was distress . Fresh beads of sweat ran down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the weeks of work that lay behind the money in its bloated bag on the table before them . The time it took to case the transfers , acquire the uniforms and the guns , and all the talk and planning that meant a perfect job . But most of all the fight all that time to control the nerve that gave him the impetus to push up the stairs , and permitted him to go through with something so big that the very thought of it had kept him awake with visions of failure . And now this cold bastard of a man was telling him their accomplishment was to be short-lived , clearly knowing that to be caught would mean finish in its truest sense . After the hard reality of the drunken Henry Jackson , the strange detached unconcern of Jim Harris was more than he could take . Joe Logart 's tongue darted across his dry lips a couple of times before he was able to speak .  | " If you knew all this from the very beginnin ' and you still went through with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance to run , that 's got ta make you the lowest crawlin ' bastard that ever lived . " His pointing finger punctuated the awful bitterness . " Because you conned me , man , you conned me , and Henry , too , into somethin ' that was too fuckin ' big for me and him to get hooked up in . From the very beginnin ' it was way over our heads . Why you done it I do n't know . The only thing that 's clear to me now is you dealt me a mother-fuckin ' bad hand . " " No , I did n't , Joe , " said Harris . " This was all figured in , man , everything was real thought out , even right down to this here conversation . " His face was expressionless , but his voice was understanding . " I did n't leave you out on no tree to be shot down by Doc Johnson . I give you the same kind of consideration I give myself and I ai n't about to commit suicide . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now and it seemed to check Logart 's fluster . " Joe , did you ever wonder why I picked a cat like Henry for somethin ' this big ? " " Yeah , yeah , maybe a little , but I was wrapped up enough just to think about if we could pull it off and what was goin ' to happen after . He did n't have very much to do , all he had to do was drive that car , so I did n't think too much about him . " " Well , I did . For a straight twenty thousand I coulda picked a hundred different guys to wheel for us , and they woulda been fallin ' over each other for the chance . But I had to know my man real good . How he gon na behave , because I needed a drunk with a braggin ' mouth , but a special kind of boozer , one that could stay off the juice for weeks . Then when he goes off the wagon he falls so loud everybody 's goin ' to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure got one , " Joe Logart said . " Your fears cloggin ' your ears , Joe . You still ai n't hearin ' me . Do n't you see what I set up , do n't you see , man ? He 's this lamb we 're goin ' to leave sittin ' for Johnson to slaughter . " " Lamb for slaughter , " Logart repeated to himself , " lamb for ? " Then the full meaning of what he was being told suddenly hit him with an excitement that sent him pacing around the room . Not taking his eyes off Harris , he walked to the table and sat down opposite him . He wanted it confirmed , he wanted to  | yell , " Tell me , tell me it all , let me hear it ! " but instead he held onto a facsimile of cool and tried to provoke Harris into an explanation by shaking his self-assurance . " You 're forgettin ' one important thing , Jimbo : to set up Henry , he 's got to stick around Harlem and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him tonight , man , he 's headin ' for Chicago . He all wrapped up in buyin ' him a bar . " Harris laughed scornfully . " I know that clown , known him for fifteen years , and I can tell ya exactly what he 's goin ' to do and one of the things ai n't gettin ' outa town . He knows nothin ' but Harlem and at his age he 's not about to change . I 'll tell ya what 's goin ' to happen to him , Joe . Once he gets his cut , he 's goin ' to go crazy , he 's goin ' to throw money around like it 's goin ' outa style and people are goin ' to start to wonder about him . Then they 're goin ' to talk , because Henry Jackson never had more than two nickels to rub together in his life and all of a sudden he 's actin ' like a rich man and when he drinkin ' he got a mouth on him , man , which you found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cats he 's hangin ' out with are gon na put it together and it 's all just a matter of time till Johnson grabs him . " " Till Johnson grabs him , " Logart repeated aloud . No longer able to look directly at Harris , he lowered his head , dismissing any remaining doubt he had about Harris ' coldly brutal abilities . He screwed him , oh , man , did he screw him , he thought , and again he smelled the sickening gunpowder , saw the bodies spinning and smashing against the windows , thrashing on the floor , again heard their cries and Harris hunched above the butchery , his face , when he turned to him , like nothing he had ever seen before . A fresh rush of suspicion swamped Logart . Watch out , watch out , he cautioned himself . " What 's the matter , Joe ? " Harris asked softly . " You worried about him ? " He knew by the silence he had jolted Logart , but he did n't realize how much he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he saw the apprehension in the trouble-scarred face . " How come you did n't tell me none of this until now ? " he asked accusingly . " For the best of reasons , man . " Harris ignored the insinuation.  | " ' Cause I needed a guy that was n't known around Harlem . It was like a lifetime ago when we did the army bit together but I remembered a lot of things about ya . I remembered what you was made of . How you 'd gamble on something big like this and that you 'd hang tough against real bad odds . " " You 're right about one thing , " Logart said sadly . " It was sure a lifetime ago , ' cause the guy you remembered is as scared as hell right now . " " If you were n't , Joe , I 'd sure be worried about your sanity . Only some kind of a fool would sit here and not be scared . I did n't want no local brave boy , and most of all some cat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else up here and I did n't need no friends workin ' for me . " Harris 's hand went around the cap of the whiskey bottle and absently began to turn it , " You see , I trust you , man , but you got a fault I had to watch out for . You too quick in givin ' a guy a break . For the last few weeks you and Henry been thrown together pretty close and I did n't know how friendly you would get with him and all I needed was for you to hint what I had set up and give that drunk a chance to get away . Yeah , I 'm usin ' him , man . I 'm goin ' to waste him to give us an edge  --  if I ca n't leave some kind of a barrier behind us I do n't think I would never got into this thing . " He leaned forward , his large hands extending and spreading , almost touching Logart . " Now you see , Joe , it was n't us goin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right along we grab them by surprise we can do it . The key to this thing was pushing that lush into the spot I got marked out for him so it give us a good runnin ' start . " Logart looked at the bag of money , and he reached out and touched it , fondling it as a man would stroke a woman . He peered at Harris . " Jimbo , you coulda been relaxin ' all this time , because when you called me in Detroit and told me what you were puttin ' together and asked if I wanted in , you were givin ' me my only chance that I 'd rise above the shit , and now there 's a hundred grand o ' my money here and for that kinda scratch I would n't tell Jesus Christ they was goin ' to crucify him . " He shook his head as though he had begun to appreciate fully what Harris had done , but he could n't shake away the doubt in his  | eyes . " Now I see the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ya even more . From the start , right down to Henry you put it together , like nothin ' I ever see or hear about before . But I think you 're forgettin ' one thing . If they grab him like you say , he goin ' ta tell him who we are sure as we 're sittin ' here talkin ' . " " So what ? " Harris snapped . " We wo n't be around . Look , man , they 're goin ' to bust their hump tryin ' to find us , they 're gon na be lookin ' all over , and when they come across Henry he 's goin ' to be a real find ' cause he 's goin ' to end up a bigger man dead than he ever were alive . Johnson 's got ta waste him big . 01 ' Doc , he gon na get the only thing he 'll be able to make a show of . " " Because they grab Henry , that 's goin ' ta stop them ? " Logart asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't no local black operation . Them dagos are everywhere . They 're still goin ' to come on after us . " " Sure , sure they will , but not half as fuckin ' hard , " Harris said , raising his voice against Logart 's carping anxieties . Then he choked back his irritation . " Man , you 're askin ' for guarantees . Well , I ca n't give ' em to ya , never could . Because you do n't go up against these people and grab their money without trouble . But we gave them a local problem and that 's what they got to think about . It 's here right in Harlem that they got ta look good , and that means Johnson 's got ta look good , because he 's their representative , and believe me , after he gets ahold of Henry and saves some face for his white bosses , it 's just got to cool them off enough to where they 're gon na sit back a little and wait . Johnson 's their man . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' cause it only natural they 're goin ' to think the money 's still in Harlem . And , baby , that 's the edge I 'm lookin ' for , ' cause they got to be like most whites , they 're gon na sell us short as dumb niggers . Time , man ; that drunk he buys us time . " The tone and knowledge of Jim Harris 's logic should have been comforting to Logart , but he was still worried beyond the sacrifice of Henry , the retribution from Doc Johnson and Italian mobsters . It tore Harris 's blueprint , months of planning did n't mean much now , for unexpectedly it had all changed and he had to say it . He took a deep breath . " Now I know the whole thing it makes good sense , Jimbo . Honest to God , man , I do n't think  | many guys coulda thought it out this way . It took a rare cat to do it and in its own way it 's kind of a beautiful thing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " just that it 's a shame it had to kick bad at almost the last second , ' cause things would be a lot easier now if the law did n't have got in our way goin ' down them stairs . " He could as easily have said " got in your way , " but he was glad it came out as it did . The chair creaked under Jim Harris 's weight , and his face reflected some of Logart 's stress . " Yeah , yeah , I know , " he said , his voice a mumble , as he tried to keep his own gnawing worry from engulfing him . " I did n't want that , Joe , I sure never meant them to be in on this . If it 'd worked the way it was meant to they would n't hardly have taken no notice . I mean my play shoulda been only against Johnson and the Syndicate and they was goin ' to be rough enough to lose without the law houndin ' after our asses . But you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goin ' to tell us how and when we spend it because they goin ' to have this case still open , hangin ' over our heads for the rest of our lives . " His voice grew grave and bitter . " And it do n't matter where you light to ' cause you ai n't goin ' to buy anything big with cash without that white man noddin ' and smilin ' and figurin ' out the bill , without thinkin ' where this black man got his money , while somebody is in the back maybe callin ' the fuzz . You goin ' to have to bury it , man , use only just enough to live , but bury the rest until what we pulled off is just some kind of a faded memory . And all that time you got ta be thinkin ' about the day you dig it up , that there be no more workin ' for short money , no more bullshit hearing somebody tellin ' you to get at the end of some goddamn gray line , no more nothin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you drink one to yourself and you think of me because we done something that you just got to feel proud about . You and me we beat the system , man , but until that day we got ta cool it behind a workin ' , square front . It 's like we both got to have patience and play it real smart and we got this thing made . " Joe Logart , as he listened , watched the sweat trickle down Harris 's almost flat nose . He watched the hand rub the sweat off and drag across the wide-boned face . He could smell the stink  | of garbage , paper-bagged , at the door and the silence of tenement , sullenly holding back its constant minute noises as if it were monitoring this hard moment of angry confidence that came at him across the table like a bracing wind . Logart knew everything would be all right . It was all going to work . " I guess I 'm too keyed up , Jimbo . I " ? the corners of his mouth pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes get like this when things get too tight . Like I said before , man , this was too big for me . I tried to kid myself , but now I know . I was afraid you might notice and get some other cat in my place . " His shoulders moved apologetically . " I guess I 'm still sort of up tight ; guess that 's why I kinda got flaked out listenin ' to Henry . Most likely ai n't nobody goin ' to pay that loudmouth no heed . They 're just gon na go on thinkin ' he 's just so much drunken bullshit and that 'll be that . I would n't be surprised tomorrow mornin ' he knockin ' on my door apologizin ' and tellin ' me to keep quiet to you about his drinkin ' . " He waited for an answer , a confirmation , but Harris kept a brooding silence , as if there was no more to say . Joe Logart wanted to linger , to talk , to dig more of this selfassurance , but now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll head me over to the hotel ; I sure as hell can use some sleep . It 's been some day . Way I feel , I think I 'm goin ' to sleep right through tomorrow . " He stood awkwardly at the table waiting for Jim Harris to rise , to slide the bolt from the barred door and let him out into the darkened hall . " Jackson has fucked us into the ground , Joe , " said Harris softly . " He 's cut down our runnin ' time to where you ai n't gon na do any sleepin ' tomorrow . " Logart squinted questioningly as though he had not caught the full meaning of the words . " Yeah , he sure pushed up our timetable , " Harris went on . " I did n't think he 'd jump the gun on me , not on a lousy few hundred . But I shoulda known , man ; I had his track record ; I shoulda known that . " The restrained almost indifference in Harris confused Logart completely . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious , they 're like laughin ' at him . You know , it 's like I told ya , maybe I blowed  | it outa proportion , like I saw things that ai n't happenin ' , you know what I mean ? " " I 'm not about to rely on a drunken Henry Jackson to keep his braggin ' mouth shut , " Harris answered in the same dry , toneless voice . " Oh , you could be right , man , but I ai n't waitin ' around too long to see if you 're wrong . " Logart 's mouth opened like a fish , but Harris signaled him to listen . " I know Doc Johnson . Money 's everything to him and he knows what it can buy . It 's only natural he goin ' to put a price on our heads and with that old mother fucker Henry runnin ' off at the mouth ai n't anyone not our enemy . Johnson would lay a good price on any cat that could rat out the kinds of information that 's goin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . " Logart 's face twisted . " Then what the hell are we waitin ' for , huh ? " he cried . " What 're we here sittin ' talkin ' all this shit for when all this shit is goin ' on in your mind ? For Christ 's sake let 's get outa here . Let 's get the fuck on the road , man , and put some distance ? " " Huh , man , where you goin ' to run to right now , tonight ? " Harris asked evenly as he stood up . " The police , they just got to have every exit out of Manhattan covered ; you could n't buy a subway ride now without a cop lookin ' ya over , wantin ' to know who you are . And all the time we were carryin ' a big bag of money . " He turned away from Logart and took a couple of steps and stood facing the door for a moment before he spoke . " Joe , I want to get out , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tonight . " He turned back to him slowly . " But when you move you going to need you a crowd to get lost in and that means tomorrow mornin ' when the streets is busy with people headin ' for work . It 'll be a lot easier to lose yourself durin ' the rush hour , man . No cop 's apt to be noticin ' a workin ' black man in no crowded train . The odds is still with us , baby , and we just got to gamble a little bit more . I doubt they could of marked him this quick . There 's a hundred Henrys drinkin ' in dozens of bars up here every night . " He raised his arm and seemed to block out the rest of the room as he pointed toward the entrance . " But if they did , man , ai n't nobody gon na come through that door alive . " There was no braggadocio in his voice . Joe Logart knew he  | meant just what he said . This impoverished flat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sordid ghetto , was guarded by a man willing to die for the bag of bulging money lying on the table before him . " What I 'm tellin ' you is what I 'm goin ' to do . But you can take your share right now , " Harris said , " or you can stay here till mornin ' , take it then and cut out when I do . Do n't matter to me ; any way you want to do it is okay with me now , man . " Logart shook his head . " We both need some sleep , Jimbo . If I stay here I 'm goin ' to talk your head off and in the mornin ' I ai n't likely to be concerned about payin ' no hotel bill . No , I 'm goin ' over to the hotel and try to get me a couple of hours sleep and check out nice and proper . No sense in raisin ' anybody 's interest in me by jumpin ' the tab . You said that , remember ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Man , you must want me to be robbed by some no-good-doin ' cats up here , because I 'd be a walkin ' target with money bulgin ' outa my pockets . " The strained smile disappeared . " No , I got ta get me my clothes and an old valise layin ' in back of the closet and pack my share in . " " Okay , Jae , " Harris said . His hand came up and touched Logart 's arm . " I 'll see you back here in the mornin ' , but you make it no later than eight o'clock , you hear ? " The large hand tightened , turning and moving Logart in step with him to the door . Harris was physically spent and wanted him to leave , he had no more strength to give to this docile man groping for assurance against the army of his fears . And he wondered where the courage he had remembered so vividly as a part of Joe Logart had gone . " Just a few more hours " ? he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomorrow , " and he slid back the bolts , one above , one below the knob . Logart stood behind him watching the muscles contract against the T-shirt covering his broad back . They bunched and rippled at the neck as Harris inched the door open and peered out . For an instant there were bodies again twisting and spinning , disbelief freezing the faces in terror , and then slamming against windows and wall . Jim Harris turned and looked at him . " You okay ? " Logart nodded . " Yeah , I 'm okay . "  | " Now do n't you forget , Joe , " Harris whispered , " that 's eight o'clock , man . Anything later and I ai n't goin ' to be here . " He sensed a question and forestalled it . " No more talk , I ca n't take no more of your talk , " he said , and opened the door wide enough for Logart . The light from the kitchen illuminated the darkened hall . " Do n't worry , Jimbo , I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Logart whispered as he passed Harris . Behind him he could hear the bolts click like muffled .22s and the lock tumble . I got a question , Jimbo . He could feel his mind formulating it . Tonight , up in that room , when you had those guys covered , I thought that white man had the gun , he had control of the gun , Jim , and he was n't about to turn it on us . He was lettin ' us take the money and , man , man , all of a sudden they were dead . Were they meant to die , Jimbo , was that in your plan , too ? Were they meant to be dead ? Harris could hear the footsteps recede on the other side of the door . He closed his eyes , leaned back against it for a moment and took a deep breath , filling his lungs with the stench of desolation . He opened his mouth as if to scream , then closed it very slowly , and the silence and loneliness moved down upon him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was bunched over the belt . The cigarette smoldered between his fingers as he worked his thick pink tongue across his lips , picking up a loose piece of tobacco and spitting it free . He staggered , reached out and grabbed the bar for support , then dug his hand clumsily into his pocket and pulled out some money . Extracting a crumpled twenty , he threw it on the bar . The crowd had thinned out by now , and back near the booths where he was standing there was room around him and the girl . The jukebox was still playing and people laughed , but Henry Jackson was too drunk to know their laughter was forced and the talk strained . He had not seen the car stop outside , nor the three white men come in and talk to the colored stranger who had been sitting near the door nursing a drink . He had not seen the Negro nod subtly in his direction and then step out to the street , to say something to another equally well-dressed black . Then the two of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customers thought that the whites were The Men , that it was some kind of stakeout and they were going to collar somebody in the place . They had that kind of fatalistic cop calm about them and maybe a pusher was being busted . Then , as the patrons sneaked further glances and sized them up , they sensed that this was n't the law , they were just grays , and probably the  | Negro they had talked to was setting up an evening of pleasure . Black women or pot or  --  it did n't matter what ; most of the people lined along the bar had to face Mr. Charlie during the working day and they did n't want to look at no goddamn white face at night , not on their home ground , not in a gin mill on a side street in Harlem . Times had changed . What were they ? Stupid ? Do n't they read the papers ? No grays allowed . Finish your drink , whiteys , and get out . We in no mood to hear your liberal slop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know you not wanted . But as the customers took a further scowling look their contempt dissolved and they became thoughtfully quiet , staring down uneasily at their drinks as they grew aware of the morbid attraction Henry Jackson had for the newcomers . The whites stood near the entrance holding glasses that they did n't bother to drink from . Laurelene 's loud laugh faded boozily as she turned toward the door , sensing the chill at the other end of the room . One by one the people fell silent . Even Henry , in his drunken haze , could feel the atmosphere change and he bobbed his head fuzzily , seeking the cause through the smoke and flashing neon light . The song ended and the jukebox colors dimmed , making the silence complete . A room that had been gay minutes before was now deadly still and the patrons waited . They were n't sure what they were waiting for but they all sensed that the lethal answer lay with the three swarthy white men near the door . " Hey , nigger . " The flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the narrow room but it seemed to be calling them all as well , for heads twisted and turned toward Difalco , the eyes suddenly blazing a silent answer of hate . Henry Jackson 's bulbous eyes peered at them and tried to keep them in focus . As he squinted along the bar he made out the sallow faces beneath the hats . The cops . He muttered , half to himself , " Yeah , yeah , they 're The Men . The fuckin ' fuzz . I 'm clean , nobody seen me . They do n't have nothin ' on me . I do n't have no record and who the hell do they think they callin ' nigger . ... If you talkin ' to me , " he snarled at them , " the name 's Mr. Jackson . " " Yeah , shine , we 're talkin ' to you . "  | The barkeep Rufus moved to the club he kept among the rags beneath the bar ; his hand went around the handle , and he sucked in his breath and waited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nigger . " Difalco 's voice cut into everyone along the bar . " I hear you been buyin ' everybody else a drink . And then I want to hear you talk again about all the sudden money you made in a big score tonight . Is that right , nigger , is that what you been sayin ' ? " Jackson 's fogged , sodden mind wobbled . If they goin ' to take me in for questionin ' ? the thought formed slowly , they should n't treat me like this . Like a man I gon na be treated . They got to give me respect . A confused Laurelene swayed on the wooden stool to get a better look at this white man who had turned a barroom of partying blacks into a funereal stillness . She shivered as his gaze swept across her . " If you think you got something on me , man , you go ahead and pull me in . " Jackson raised his hands in mockery . " Come on , cop , come on . Put the cuffs on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk . I do n't take that , you hear me ? " " Oh , I 'm goin ' to do better than pull you in , shine , " Difalco said solemnly . " I 'm going to lay you out in a pine box . " And he stepped away from where he was standing and walked slowly toward Jackson , followed by the two hulking whites . As they moved past the sullen customers , now hunched silently over their drinks , a few lifted their heads , letting their puzzled eyes , some seething , others awed , follow them , knowing not only that Henry Jackson was being humiliated unmercifully , but that all were being abrasively put down . But nobody moved . This kind of attention meant something far more ominous than white men taunting a Negro . That was n't done up here . Not in Harlem . But every last one of them heeded the credo of the street . Whatever it is do n't get involved ; let it be . Laurelene had not taken her eyes off Difalco and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edged back toward the empty booths . Then suddenly her hands went to her face and she screamed a warning . " They not the police , Henry ! They not the law ! " Her shrill cry reminded him that Jim Harris had given him  | a gun . " If they catch up to ya , use the gun . " People pushed away from him and Henry Jackson stood alone , filled with the blind false courage of drink . He lurched , almost staggered away from the bar and took up their challenge . His hand groped inside his waistband , reaching for the gun . But it was too late . Difalco 's fist caught him across the side of his face , slamming him back against the bar , and the gun fell to the floor . He stood braced against the counter , his mouth agape , the eyes clouded in a whiskey stupor . Frantically he looked down for his weapon , but it was too far away ; he could never reach it . Then , suddenly , Henry realized the hopelessness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But another punch snapped his head back across the bar and Difalco stepped away to give his two button men room to work . One hit him , then the other . Jackson went down sprawling on his face . They pulled him up . His lips were cut and blood ran from his nose . His eyes were turned up and he moaned as the bull-necked torpedo held him propped against the bar while his partner pumped his right hand into Henry 's stomach , doubling him into a dry retch . He was struck again , and then again . The sickening silence of the room was broken only by the thud of the blows and the grunts of an unconscious man . Some of the customers had started to edge for the door when Jackson pulled the gun , but one of the outside Negroes watching the street had come back in and he held them inside the entrance by his appearance alone , because somebody had recognized him and whispered he worked for Doc Johnson . The word spread like a combustible fire . They all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Only Laurelene , pressed up against a booth in the rear of the bar , could not take it and she vented her horror at the sight . " You lousy white mother flickers ! " she screamed , but still nobody moved to help him . As the echo of her shrill voice died against the silence of the room , Difalco snarled , " Okay , that 's enough , " and they stopped their hatchet job , letting the bloodsmeared Jackson slump to the floor like a crushed balloon . A large man in a maroon sports shirt stood not quite lost in the tight-lipped crowd , for he was half a head taller than the others . His eyes had smoldered in rage as he watched the white  | professionals work over the drunk . He was going to let it pass , let them walk out , because it was obviously meant only as a brutal lesson . A man can recover from a beating . But when they lifted Jackson , lugging and pulling him like a slab of gored meat , and followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throbbing pulse of anger . He stepped out in front of them , his fists clenched like blocks of black stone , and his face showed the loathing that Laurelene had cried out to the muzzled room moments before . The unconscious Jackson was eased to the floor and the hoods moved up behind Difalco . But a gun was already in his hand . He raised it slowly , pressed it almost between the eyes of the Negro and cocked the trigger . " If you want your black head blown off , shine , you just make a move to stop us . " The muscles in the Negro 's arms twitched and he stood for what seemed an eternity facing the ugly barrel in the terrible hush of the room . Then he gave way ; he stepped back slowly and Difalco 's gun followed him , pushing him up against the wall . One of the hoods grabbed Jackson 's collar , and dragged him face down to the door , where the other picked up his feet and they carried him out . The breathing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lowered the gun from the terrified black man , turned and walked from the bar .  | " I wan na walk up . I wan na walk up . Oh , Jesus , Jesus , hear my plea . I wan na walk up them salvation stairs . " The black cloth rolled to the movements of the shuffling body and the inky face was thrown back toward the paint-chipped ceiling . " Jesus , Jesus . " His voice strained in its reach , the sweat rolling down his face , catching on his jowls , then dropping to the floor of the shabby stage . He finished the solo against a continual clapping rhythm produced by robed sisters . A girl , a virginal white cassock covering her skinny frame , stepped forth and belted into the sublime reaches of the spiritual . She bent and rose and threw her arms above her head , and her fervor moved the sparse , ragged congregation , sitting in rows of straight-backed chairs in front of her , into bellows of redemption . The singers behind her caught the spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other , they merged into cries of rejoicing that lifted them above the poverty and strife , the dole and depression , to an elation that they were sure brought them to the very threshold of Christ . On and up and still higher they moved and the badly tuned piano banged along in accompaniment .  | The clerical smile was frozen beneath the flaring nostrils and the mustache as he came at them like a practicing undertaker . His hands were clasped and he wore the traditional black smock of pious dignity . " Good evenin ' , gentlemen . My name is Curtis ; I 'm the church deacon . Can I help you , please ? " Bill Pope 's hand went into his pocket and he flashed the badge strictly for formality , for he knew the deacon had him and his white partner made as The Men . " You got a Miss Harris here ? " Pope asked , while Frank Sullivan looked at Deacon Curtis and thought he had seen him before . It must have been in some old ID file , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He smiled to himself . The cleric 's eyes widened theatrically and he looked astonished . " You mean Miss Lucy Harris , who play piano for our tabernacle choir ? " Neither man answered him . " That 's a good-doin ' woman . She never get in no trouble . " They remained silent . " You 'll find her a very religious person . " They stared at him . " I 'll go get her . " The storefront church was on Lenox Avenue , four floors of sordid walkups above it . Its window , flaked with grime , bore a crude painting of Christ lofting an avenging sword while at his feet lay a severed serpent 's head . Over the entrance hung a sign : " GOD LOVES YOU . HE WHO ENTERS WILL BE CLEANSED . " The detectives stood just inside the door . The main hall , running to the back yard , was partitioned off from the entrance by blinds that masked the sight , but not the sounds , of redemption . To their right was a white-walled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of chairs and a settee . The deacon led her formally by the arm . She was a stout woman in a white robe and her eyes were enlarged by the lenses of her glasses . Fortyish and prim , and her round face was indignant . " This way , gentlemen , if you please , " the deacon whispered . " I think y'all be more comfortable in our sitting room " ? he took  | a look back toward the singing congregation ? " and more private . People sometimes get nosy about these things , you know . " The detectives followed them into the room . The deacon , still guiding the woman , led her to a chair , then walked back and shut the parlor door . It filtered out most of the sound . " That choir , when they catch the true spirit like they got tonight , they kinda move our membership to enthusiastic response , " he said , and came back to the center of the room . His lips smiled down benevolently at Lucy Harris . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our semimonthly special nighttime service . It is quite popular with our congregation . Why , we have people who moved out of the community to Brooklyn and the Bronx who still come for this upliftin ' service . " " Are you the preacher ? " Sullivan asked tonelessly . " Oh , my , no , no . " His eyes rolled in denial , as if embarrassed by the thought . " No , I 'm jest his assistant . The pastor , Gregory , he gon na speak after the singin ' . " His hands were clasped together , lost in the folds of his robe , and he leaned forward earnestly , as though imparting a great truth . " I only hope you gentlemen got the time and will stay and hear him . He truly one of the most elegant speakers you could ever want to hear . Tonight he goin ' to be specially good ' cause he goin ' to speak on God , You and the Devil . ' " Both detectives stood looking at him , Sullivan not sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having heard this kind of talk before , turned to the woman . " Miss Harris , " he said , and the deacon turned his head as though not to miss a word and gazed serenely at the detective , waiting for him to continue . Frank Sullivan pointed his thumb toward the door . " Okay , assistant , if we need you we 'll call you . " The deacon stared into the suddenly congealing blue eyes and the ecumenical look drained from his face . " Of course , " he mumbled , " of course , " and walked out of the room . A flick of humor flashed in Bill Pope 's eyes as he glanced at Sullivan . " Miss Harris , my name is Pope . This is Detective Sullivan . " He motioned toward Frank , who had moved away from the questioning and now leaned against the edge of the desk , lighting a cigarette . " I 'm sorry we have to intrude on you this  | way , " he said courteously , " but it 's necessary that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James Harris . " She tilted up her fleshy face , her eyes glaring through the glasses , hard and ungiving and coldly assessing his authority . " Never " ? she shook her head ? " no , I never goin ' to live this down . What the congregation goin ' to think when Deacon Curtis tell them their music player bein ' questioned by the law like some common thief ? Can you answer me that ? Can you tell me what I 'm goin ' to say to all them hard-workin ' decent-livin ' people inside ? " And she sat there with all the moral strength of a crusading evangelist directed against this onslaught of the heathens . The detectives knew about the Lucy Harrises ; Sullivan from observant distance , and his Negro partner from up close . Every family seemed to have its religious enthusiast who would venerate the virtues of a lean , white , dead-bodied Christ while he or she moved through the live swamp of stink in a black ghetto . Most of them were strangely anesthetized to the roar of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and withered arms , the hooker working her trade in the back of a hall , and the drunks they had to pick their way through on Sunday mornings , still lying in the vomit of Saturday nights . To hell with the sinners , they seemed to cry from their high protective walls of self-righteousness that isolated them from the grinding impoverishment . They were blind to it all and without compassion , for they lived only for the serenity of that beautifully nebulous day when they would rise gloriously from it to meet their maker . Bill Pope tried again . " If this was a normal police situation , Miss Harris , where we had the time to speak to you at your home , we would have done so . We do n't like to embarrass you like this , but it 's very important that we locate your brother , so if you will answer a few questions I will try and make this as quick and painless as possible . " " Why ? " she snapped . " What you want to speak to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at last there was an opening and even though she led the way he was glad to follow momentarily . " Well , it 's quite possible he committed a very serious crime . "  | " What you mean when you say serious ? " " Seven men were killed tonight during a robbery . Your brother is suspected of being one of the men who pulled it off . " She sat in her sulking silence , the enlarged eyes behind the glasses unblinking , the black face unmoved by the terrible accusation . Pope could almost feel a barrier slam down between them but he continued . " And he 's going to stay suspected until someone can check on his whereabouts earlier this evening . That 's what we 're attempting to do right now . And the quickest way to do that is to speak to him . So if you can tell us where he 's staying at the present we could ? " " I do n't know where he livin ' . " Pope , exasperated , half expected Frank Sullivan 's voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew why Frank was holding back his aggressiveness but wondered how long he could keep it up . " It 's not necessary that you know his address , " Pope said , adding more authority to his tone , " if you know where he might hang out or the names of some of his friends . What I 'm asking for is simply some information that could lead us to your brother . " Beads of sweat were on her forehead but the crumpled handkerchief in her hand stayed on her lap and her face did not change . The choir and the shouts of religious frenzy coming through the walls were muffled and melancholy . Pope 's initial look at her had convinced him that the woman was incapable of duplicity , that she was too deeply religious to cover for her brother once she heard the charge . Now he wondered whether he had taken too much for granted and was treating her too gently , whether behind her piety was evasiveness . " If your brother is our man and you 're holding back information , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other people 's lives in jeopardy , because I do n't think any of the men involved in this would hesitate to kill again to avoid being captured . And I do n't think you 're the type of person who would want that on your conscience , relative or not . " He waited for an answer but she gave no acknowledgment she had heard him . " Bill , " Sullivan called , and Pope held back a second before he  | turned , not sure of what kind of look he would receive . But there was not a trace of criticism in his partner 's eyes . The ruddy face was subdued . " I 'd better get with a phone , " Sullivan said easily . " I 'll let the precinct know what we have so far and see what 's up . He turned from Pope and opened the door and a heavy bass voice inundated the parlor with syrupy words of thanks to the singers for their wonderful hymn to Jesus . The door closed but the voice was not to be denied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lean frame and lit a cigarette , letting the irritation subside as he pulled slowly on the butt before he spoke . " I can understand how you must feel about the police , under the circumstances of being questioned right here in the church , and to be questioned about someone close to you in connection with such a bad crime . I know it can be a very tryin ' experience , but you got ta understand , Miss Harris , I 'm just one o ' the hired help tryin ' to do a difficult job in the best way I know how . All I 'm doin ' here is checkin ' out leads . Your brother happens to be one of them . He just a suspect and not a strong one at that . So if you can see your way in helpin ' us to eliminate him off our list it would be well appreciated . " Pope watched the emotionless face for a reaction . But it did not change . He might have been some despised door-to-door white peddler trying to collect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the preacher could now be heard bellowing a parable to the assemblage behind the thin walls . Bill Pope decided he was wasting his time with Miss Lucy Harris . Frustrated , he turned toward the door to seek out Sullivan and the street . " Mr. Detective , " she said roughly ; he turned around to her . " You do n't know how I feel about nothin ' . You do n't even know me but I 'm gon na tell ya somethin ' before you leave . " Her voice was touched by a bitter honesty that held him riveted . " I 'm a religious person who give my time free to the church because I believe we all bein ' judged every day of our lives , how we behave , by a Super Bein ' that 's above us all . And sometime people say , Because you devout and all the time runnin ' to church and prayin ' , you stupid . ' " She pushed her heavy body forward in the chair . " But if you think I 'm goin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man done walked out of the room , you the one that 's stupid " ? she snorted her contempt ? " ' cause you can save that all us colored folk ' routine for where it might do more good . You do n't need to use that darky stuff with me because I got news for you , baby : if I knew James ' whereabouts I would n't need no promptin ' , I 'd tell ya . " The crumpled handkerchief she had worried with her fingers at last rose and dabbed at the dark , intense face . Surprised by the sudden burst of denunciation , especially of her brother , the detective kept silent and watched her eyes . " I stopped talkin ' to James a long time ago , even before he done went out and spread his wings on big-shot ideas . I wash my hands of him . I 'm the oldest in my family and when my mother die I help bring up my brothers and sisters . And I do all right ' cause they all turn out good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " All except that James . Even then , even when that boy were a child , he always gettin ' messed up in all kinds o ' trouble . I told him he goin ' to end up bad . He gon na end up a bum . I told him , and you know how I knew ? " Her tone moved higher , the evangelist showing more clearly in her eyes . " . ' Cause as a little boy he never opened his heart to God , he have no room for religious understandin ' . He was always runnin ' around the streets with a lotta other little bums and stealin ' just about everything he can get his hands on . How could he grow up right leadin ' that kind of life ? A person that denies his soul to God is goin ' to end up in hell and that sure enough where my brother James Harris is goin ' to go . " . . and now Deacon Brown will move out amongst you good , God-fearin ' people and anything you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sullivan came in . The muffled oratory of a moment before now boomed through the parlor as Preacher Gregory moved among his congregation to get the collection . Frank Sullivan received Pope 's negative glance . He looked down at the woman , whose body was perched forward , her fingers kneading the wet crumpled handkerchief . A lousy waste of time , the black bitch , he said to himself , and looked up at his Negro partner . " If you 're finished with Miss Harris , Bill , " he said affably , " there 's something I want to see over on Park Avenue . "  | He turned and started toward the door , while Pope held still , looking at the woman , who had stiffened into a statue in the presence of the white man . " If you do hear from him , Miss Harris , " he said , " you can contact us at the local precinct . " She answered him with a cold silence that turned him toward the waiting Sullivan . " Mr. Detective . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and looked back at her . " If you come across my brother James will you do something for me ? " " Sure , " Pope answered her . " You tell him for me , Satan damn it , God save it . ' " Fire and brimstone leaped past them through the open door as the voice of the preacher came at them in imploring cries of " Repent , repent , " and sorrow rose from the pews in answer : " Amen , amen . " And the fat lady , her black face shining with sweat , stared with the eyes of a true believer .  | The siren was nudged on Lenox Avenue . It goaded an opening in the traffic and they turned left past Mount Morris Park with its sparse trees , their twisted branches reaching out as if trying to flee the frightening nightmare behind the rusted fence . They rolled past Madison Avenue , down a garbage-littered side street , past rows of dismal brownstones and tenements . The tunnel began in the midtown labyrinth of Grand Central Terminal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles north the tracks came out at the other end of Park Avenue . Out of the pit the commuter trains climbed the track over the iron and concrete girders , and the passengers , absorbed in their evening papers , or their drinks in the club cars , did not bother to look out the windows . What was there to see but the same ugly buildings with their grime-pitted windows pressed in along the tracks , the garbage , long overdue for pickup , piled overflowingly along the curbs , the abandoned cars and back yards and lots filled with debris . Then the trains started their long screech for the local 125th Street stop , showering sparks down on the closed secondhand stores and open bars beneath the elevated tracks . Pope maneuvered the car around an iron girder and under the el . The light from the overhead street lamps that ran parallel to the tracks was lost in the grayness under the viaduct . A red-andamber  | light revolved in the distance . The radio car , its doors open , stood empty , facing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pope eased to a stop behind it and doused the headlights . The whirling splashes of light atop the patrol car picked up two uniformed cops , whose cigarettes were hastily dropped and stomped out . Both men stiffened as Sullivan walked out of the slush of shadow past the patrol car . " Oh , it 's you , Frank . " The larger one relaxed and his voice seemed sorry he had dropped his smoke . " You got a DOA here ? " Sullivan asked leaving out the salutations , his eyes going to the ground in front of the patrol car , searching the shadows for the inevitable blanket-covered body . " Take it easy , Frank , " the other cop greeted the detective . " This jig ai n't going anyplace . " Bill Pope had emerged slowly , from the other side of the car . The cop had uttered the flippancy without remembering that the white detective was teamed with a black . He realized he had spoken too quickly as Sullivan 's eyes moved past him to Bill Pope coming around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and looked into Pope 's stare . In the silence the patrolman 's embarrassment turned into defensive anger . Fuck him , one could almost hear him think . His sallow face tightened as if daring Pope to do something about it . Pope accepted the challenge and took a step forward . " What have you got , Molloy ? " Frank said to the other white cop , his voice a quick pitch of warning to Pope to forget it . " We got a lulu , Frank . " Molloy had picked up Sullivan 's cue and moved between his uniformed partner and Pope . " It 's really wild . " He turned to his partner . " Show him , Pete . " For a moment the young white cop held his ground , then slowly , unwillingly he took his angry eyes off the Negro detective . But Bill Pope did n't move and the cop had to walk around him , making sure he did n't brush against Pope on his way to the driver 's side of the patrol car . Then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was crucified , pressed against the wall . The head was pulled back , held in position by a rope looped tightly around the throat , then tied to one of the numerous spikes that protruded  | from the wall . It looked as if the body had been garroted , then strung up , but the grotesqueness did not stop there . It was suspended three feet from the ground and supported by a filesharpened steel spike that ran through the back of the body , sticking out gruesomely above the stomach . Murmurs rose around them and Sullivan turned quickly away as the headlights clarified the grisly form before them . He squinted out from under the el . He had not noticed the onlookers before . They had been standing in silence along both curbs of the street . Now , under the impact of the macabre sight , a ripple of noise grew stronger . " Turn it off , " Sullivan said sharply . The patrol-car lights went off but the flurry of voices could still be heard along the curb . " They 're not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Molloy said . " It 's kinda weird . They stand there like they want to see , but they do n't come under the tracks . Oh , a few kids came running over , but most of the older people stand around like they were at a funeral . I ca n't figure it . " " Gim me your flashlight , Jack , " Sullivan said , and took it out of the cop 's hand . He did n't switch it on . His eyes were becoming accustomed to the darkness and the flashes of light rotating atop the patrol car outlined the brutalized form . He turned over an empty garbage can , pulled it next to the body and climbed on top . " Check his pants ; I 'll get the coat , " he said to Pope , who had moved up alongside . When he turned the flashlight on he saw a horror movie in closeup . The arms were spread in unnatural slackness from the sides of the body and supported by some of the spikes that ran , like many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sullivan pushed the flashlight in close , but kept the beam away from the bulging , unbelieving eyes . The lips were parted across the gaping mouth in a terrifying silent screech and adhesive strips still clung to the frayed mustache where they had been applied to muffle the screams . Blood from the cuts on face and scalp had started to cake in brown streaks across the ink-black face . " Hey , you ca n't touch the body , " the voice of the younger cop barked nastily behind them . " What are you two brains tryin ' to  | pull ? We 're not lettin ' nobody touch him until ? " " Shut your mouth , " Sullivan snarled as his hand went inside the dead man 's jacket and pulled out a wallet . He was about to jump down , then twisted back to the body . He held the flashlight straight down . In the dim light his hand moved to the crushed face and his fingers closed the eyes . Sullivan held the flashlight while Pope went through the wallet , flipping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the light . " Here it is , Frank , " he said . " Henry Lamont Jackson , 561 West 146th Street . " He looked up . " That 's over past Amsterdam Avenue . " Sullivan waited for him to jot down the name and address , then switched off the light . Their faces were blurred in the murky grayness that filtered in under the el . The two uniformed cops stood watching curiously but they could n't see the excitement beneath Bill Pope 's apparent calm . The uniformed cop could have no idea that Henry Lamont Jackson in death had given a clue so solid Pope felt he could stand on it . Nor could the two cops peering at them see the respect he felt for Sullivan 's gutter perceptions during a telephone conversation while Pope struggled in the storefront church against the blank black wall of a woman 's hate and fanaticism . " What 's happening , Connolly ? " Sullivan had asked the desk sergeant when he phoned the precinct , and was filled in on the normal routine of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a ludicrous legal understatement until a medical examiner stamped it violent . A liquor store broken into on Saint Nicholas Avenue . A knifing outside the Convent of the Sacred Heart ; the sisters called , alerted by the screams . And in their prayers they would remember the scream and pray for the dead as well as the living . A husband-and-wife scuffle in the Green Towers Apartments , that high-rise middle-income development with a facade of snobbery in the turbulent surrounding sea of want . Yeah , she used a broken bottle and slashed up his face . And Connolly had droned on in a bored monotone reciting his tally sheet of violence . " You think there 's a connection ? " Pope queried , acting out a charade in front of the inquisitive patrolmen . It was obvious that  | they would check out the address , but it was Frank 's play , his intuition . Pope fed him the line , knowing what the answer would be before he even spoke , letting his senior partner dictate the move that had already begun , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be subordinate to the hard white man 's first grade status and five years in the ghetto ; letting him lead the chase . " I do n't know , it could be . " Sullivan shrugged , also underplaying , conscious of their audience . " What do you say we check it out for the hell of it , anyway ? " He looked back to the harpooned remains stuck brutally against the wall . A memory gnawing in the back of his mind suddenly crystallized and now he knew what it had reminded him of  --  an army checkpoint long ago on a rural road in an almost forgotten country . The bamboo house behind the guard point , where friends and relations had gathered  --  cheerful slanted eyes , white lace shirts and frilly dresses and no shoes . It was some kind of holiday , or maybe it was a wedding ; he was n't sure . But he remembered the men tying a pig to a tree and taking festive swigs from a bottle while they waited for the hog to calm itself . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had failed to knock the animal out . The front legs went out from under it , the head split open , the blood running down the pink skin and over the beady terrified eyes , and Sullivan had turned away , revolted . He waited for the second blow , hearing the piercing squeals of pain , then the hammer fell again , bringing a sickening , almost human screech . And they had to strike a third time . Finally silence , and despite himself he looked . A pole , sharpened at one end , was held at the backside of the hog and then driven into its rear , suddenly reviving the animal into terrible shrillings of agony , and then it seemed to die again . Each sledgehammer blow riding the spit further into its innards would bring it to agonizing life , to scream again , and he had had enough , enough . The .45 came out of his holster , he slammed the slug into the chamber and walked into the middle of their holiday , stunning them into silence . They backed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The gun went to the head of the pig and they all began to speak excitedly . " No , Joe , no . " He looked up  | into the face of an old man , the yellow skin so tight it looked as if it were ready to tear open . " No good , Joe . " The old man shook his head frantically . " No good , no good . " The gasp at his feet brought his eyes back down . What life remained expired in a terminal snort , the head flickering in a final quiver . Blood ran down its flesh , across the eyes , down the sides of the snout into the petrified open mouth . Patrolman Molloy 's voice brought him back to the present . " What 's the big deal , Sully ? Hey , Sully , " Molloy said , his broad red face pushing in close . Frank Sullivan turned away from the outlined body . " Were you two the first on the scene ? " he asked . " Yeah . A guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wildeyed when he tells us there 's somebody strung up under the tracks . We think right away we got a nice quiet suicide , maybe with a little more imagination than the average leaper . There 's not many that take the out in the street . That takes a little showmanship . But after we see the body " ? his head motioned to the wall ? " I was n't about to pull him off the hook . We got to wait around for the medical examiner . I 'll let him take it down . " Molloy paused and winked at Sullivan . " You know , he might have to make a report that the deceased did n't put himself up on that wall . " Sullivan ignored Molloy 's sardonic gibe , but he knew what he meant : he did n't want to get caught in a coroner 's inquiry , court appearances and all the legal red tape a murder like this could entail . " Any of the brass been here ? " Sullivan asked casually , trying to hide his interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring out the gold badges . " Far off a dim rumble was heard . " You know what we get up here , Frank , better than I do . Maybe five or six stiffs a week are part of the job . " Molloy smiled . " It takes a big deal to pull them gold badges off their asses . They do n't come to Siberia for something like this . " The din in the distance grew louder . " In fact , I 'm even surprised to see you two here . " Molloy , hands on his hips , now had to raise his voice to be heard against the swelling crash of sound . " It takes something big for them to  | make an appearance like " ? his eyes narrowed shrewdly in the wide florid face ? " like " ? and he had to shout the words to be heard above the thunderous roar ? " like that shooting earlier tonight . " Above their heads bedlam , then the screech of iron wheels locking against the rails and sliding like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window reflected off the vibrating third-floor windows of the tenements . The New Haven train made its 125th Street stop . Frank Sullivan had no more questions to ask . He turned and walked past the patrol car to their own unmarked sedan . But Pope stood and looked at the young cop Molloy had called Pete . " Here , " Pope said , holding the wallet out to him , " put it back . " The cop glared at him , as if debating whether to take it , then hesitatingly his hand came up . " He wont hurt you . " Pope 's tone was sheeted in sarcasm . " He 's just a dead black man , " and he slapped the wallet into Pete 's hand . Frank was already behind the wheel and waited for his partner to get in before he turned the motor on . Molloy had followed him . He bent his broad frame and looked into the car as though he wanted to pursue the idea sparked in him by the detectives ' brisk search of the body and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I helped scrape a lot of stiffs off the sidewalks up here , " Molloy said , looking at both of them but talking to Sullivan . " I did the death watch on some real weirdos , a couple maybe even crazier than this . " His brow wrinkled in speculation and he shrugged . " I do n't know , like there 's something awful offbeat here . You know what I mean ? " The veteran cop caught Sullivan 's interest . His hand moved away from the ignition . " Was there anybody acting suspiciously around the body when you pulled in , Jack ? " " No , not suspicious . " He shook his head . " But that 's it . That 's the trouble , Sully . It 's the way the crowd was actin ' when we came in under the tracks . Somebody had a flashlight on the stiff and maybe there 's fifty , sixty guys all talkin ' real low to each other . Generally , when something like this happens , it 's tough moving the crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch the whole procedure . But they all went back nice and easy without any coaxing . " He jerked his head toward the cluster of  | watchers huddled along the curbs , now in subdued conversation . " It 's like word is being passed around not to get too nosy . The crowd 's gotten a little bigger but nobody 's getting curious enough to come across the street . It 's like something 's telling them to stay away from this . " The detectives sat and watched Molloy 's broad freckled face struggle to articulate what had started out to be routine . His was purely an objective view , that of a cop assigned to stand the death watch over another violent dispatch in Harlem . Just another one of the more than two hundred and fifty murders recorded in the uptown police ledger each year , murders that rarely made a line in the New York papers . Frank Sullivan was becoming impatient to leave , for he felt Molloy had no more to tell him . Then the cop said something that made him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . " The guy who flagged us down said the call came to a nearby gin mill . " He pointed to a bar located at the corner . " The caller told them to take a look at what was under the tracks . I never heard of anybody wanting a body found before , did you ? " Bill Pope caught his partner 's look , a signal exchanged . Then Sullivan turned the key in the ignition and peered up at Molloy . It was likely that much of his excessive interest was an excuse to break up a disagreeable duty . He 'd forget most of this with time . Maybe over a beer he might tell someone else , but thereafter it would fade and be just another memory . The detective made a mental note that when this was over , he and Pope owed the big cop a drink to tell him how sharp his perception had been and what he had contributed . But he played it cool now . " I think you must have seen too many of them movie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run away with you . " Molloy straightened up from the car and gazed down at the detectives . " Yeah , yeah , maybe you 're right , " he said dryly . And the look in his eyes made Frank Sullivan think that Molloy 's story might just make it across the sergeant 's desk at the end of his tour . " Hey , " the driver called out of a car that had pulled up on Bill Pope 's side . The street lamp washed the car in light and the lettering on the door read : " THE DAILY NEWS-NEW YORK 'S  | PICTURE NEWSPAPER . " " What 's with the crowd ? " He leaned out of the window . " You guys got anything we can use ? " Blacks kill blacks , fuck it . Blacks kill cops , sells newspapers , Pope thought . Sullivan deliberately turned on the low beams and backed the sedan slowly from behind the patrol car . In the grizzled darkness the revealing light turreted on top of the police car streaked past the wall . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reporter . He then twisted the small spotlight that was on the side of his car and threw its beam against the wall . It picked up an arm . He worked the handle and the jarring brightness pinned Henry Lamont Jackson in its terrible glare . The whistle came low , like the sound little boys make between their teeth . " Holy Christ , " he said . " Hey , " he yelled to Pope , sliding past , " hey , what 's the bit ? What 's the story on this ? " Bill Pope raised his arm out of the window and pointed to the young white cop he had handed the wallet to . " Why do n't you ask him ? He 's got a lot of mouth . "  | The flashlight beam picked its way across the broken mailboxes . Some of the small doors were jimmied , others were torn away . The name was blurred across the smudged adhesive : 5B ? always the top floor . The vestibule door of the tenement was open and they walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut a slow bounding circle of white up the wooden steps , which creaked beneath their weight . They leaned cautiously into the wall in a slow ascent , neither man trusting the bannister , for more than one cop had taken a vicious header when rotted wood gave way in their hands . The smells of chitterlings and pork and urine filled the hall and the usual cans of garbage on the landings stood in an overflow of chicken bones and roaches . The cry of a baby was heard and the voice of a drunk called a woman a whore and she answered him , " You nigger mother fucker . " Television and radio noises mixed with the sound of running water from a broken flush . Sullivan was familiar with the fetid smells and snarling frustration that filtered dejectedly through the impersonal walls of all the tenements he had walked through in his time , dense , mean , raw . Without hope or a chance for dignity . The crippling , melancholy surroundings made his breath come like a sigh in the darkness , as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his foot stumbled against a garbage  | can . Casually he played the light on it . A rat rose up suddenly , its fat gray body , which had been wallowing in the filth , now tensed and reared back in a squealing snarl . The small , blood-red eyes in the pointed fur face recoiled in the light , the mouth flashed yellowed fangs . Sullivan 's flesh crawled as he steadied for its spring . The rat wheeled and jumped , landing on his leg , clung for a frightening instant , then slipped down and across his shoes . He could hear it scurry along the hall and down the steps . " Frank , here it is . Five B. " Pope 's words came from the other side of the hall . Sullivan eased his breath out slowly and then turned , flashing the full beam on him . Pope was fixed in its round glow like an actor in a theatrical spotlight . There was no answer to his knock . He tried again , this time louder , more demandingly , so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He looked at Frank and was about to rap again when light showed through a crevice at the bottom of the door . Feet shuffled across the floor inside . " Who is it ? " a tired voice asked . " The police , " came the reply . There was a pause . Finally they heard the familiar scrape of a police lock sliding from its notch in the floor . The lock on the door tumbled and the door cracked open . Concerned eyes squinted around its edge in a dark sleep-leadened face . Sullivan lowered the flashlight to the floor . She was silhouetted by the light behind her , hands high , ready to slam the door back into its locks . " Mrs. Jackson ? " Pope asked . She stared at them for long seconds as though she had n't heard him , and he had to ask her again , his tone taking on an official tone . " Are you Mrs. Henry Jackson ? " " Yes , I 'm Mrs. Jackson , " she answered slowly . Pope was about to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We 'd like to speak to you . " " There 's no trouble up here . " Weariness was in the voice , but the dark eyes became circumspect as she peered past Pope at the white detective . " I did n't call no police . " " It 's about your husband , " Pope said . Her hand moved around to the edge of the door and clung  | there for support . In the dim light her eyes seemed to blur as she stared at them , not sure what to say or do . " We 'd like to talk to you inside , " Pope said . Her face hung there for a moment more , then she opened the door , closed it behind them and led them down the short hall of a railroad flat and into the kitchen , the soft slap of her slippers filling the hall . They had no warrant so there could be no search , but Sullivan instinctively looked about for anything abnormal . He flashed the light into the darkened room beyond . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cot ; the other three , their slack bodies beaded in perspiration , slept on a bed pushed against a window , where a fan on the sill flipped the curtains and moved the summer heat around the humid room . A shabby robe hung loosely about Mrs. Jackson 's skinny frame , and her feet shuffled across a piece of torn linoleum as if trying to cover her impoverishment . Paint was peeling from the walls and a frayed cord hung from the chipped globe on the ceiling . But the curtains were clean and the kitchen had the heavy antiseptic smell of too much detergent . She slumped down at the table . The thin somber face looked up at them , searching their silence . Then , as if she found the answer , her wan voice rose out of a pit of premonition . " Something has happened to him , has n't it ? " Bill Pope could answer only by nodding his head . For an instant her body seemed to sag , but her face gave no indication of emotion as she continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is n't he ? " Pope nodded again . " Yes , " he said , and stopped , waiting for an outcry of sorrow . But none came as she lowered her head to the faded tablecloth , on which stood a small vase of artificial flowers . She leaned down against her skinny arms , as if the weight of her thoughts were unendurable . Pope glanced at his partner , but Sullivan was peering stoically down at the bowed head . Encouraged by her restraint , Pope went on . " This is a bad time to ask you questions , but your husband did n't die under natural causes . The circumstances of his death ... " He stopped , disliking  | the sound of his own voice . " I 'm sorry , but it 's necessary we ask a few questions . " No grieving , no sad sobs , just the dreadful silence . And to Pope , the death of Henry Jackson had suddenly become the detestable job of telling a woman she was a widow . " Are you all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no answer and he paused , taking a breath like someone about to plunge into cold water , wishing that it was over and done with . " What we 'd like to know is if your husband had any dealings with a man called James Harris . It is believed that Harris had recently been released from prison and he could have been in contact with your husband . " Slowly she raised her head , the dark face pinched in desolation , and tears ran down her cheeks . " How did he die ? " she asked . The grieving query reverberated off the washed-down walls and echoed corrosively in the poverty-smelling rooms . And the detectives knew they had blindly run into a depth of sorrow from which there was nothing to do but retreat , retreat , retreat . But leave her with a shred of kindness . " He was hit by a car , a hit-and-run , " Frank Sullivan said . Her hand brushed away a tear as she strove for control in front of these strangers . " He were n't living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eyes , embarrassed by what she was about to say . " I have n't seen him in over a month . I do n't know where he was stayin ' . I hear talk he took a furnished room someplace , but I do n't know where . I do n't know . " She shrugged hopelessly and looked up at Sullivan . " But if you find out his address I 'd like to know . I 'd be grateful so I can go over there and get what little belongings he had . " She had gotten to Sullivan long before her words did . Her sorrow had reached gropingly toward him like a supplicating hand . Maybe she had seen commiseration in the blue eyes , maybe to another sufferer he wore his own loss like a black armband of grief . " He were always talkin ' about doin ' things . He wanted to be somebody , " she said quietly . " I guess he felt the children and me held him down . Me , I do n't know . Maybe he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he had too much to drink ,  | tellin ' how he coulda done this and that if he did n't have to care about us . But I loved him and so did the kids . And when he left us this time I know he come back to us like he always do . But I did n't think it would be like this . " A spasm shook her and she sobbed , her mouth tight over her mournful memories . Sullivan 's intuition still told him he was right . He felt they now had the first jagged piece of the sordid puzzle , but without names to follow up and add substance to a hunch , it had no im mediate use . And now it was dying against this blank wall of a widow 's lament . His tongue was dry . He had to lick his lips to speak . " You 'll be able to claim his body at the city morgue , " he said , and watched her lower her eyes , her fingers tracing an aimless design on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely want you to identify him . They 'll get in touch with you . " He knew the words were calloused and cold , but there was nothing else he could think of that could comfort this tragic figure . He had had enough , and turned to the door , away from the heavy smell of cleanser fighting its losing battle against the roaches now beginning to crawl out from under the sink and the stink coming through the open windows from the filth and rubble that rose from the decaying yards . " I  --  I mean we " ? her voice followed down the hall after him , touching him like a cripple 's crutch , making him look back at the weary face straining for words difficult to express ? " we never do get married legal-like ; we always had an understandin ' about that , like it was n't goin ' to make me love him any more than I do . " She halted , struggling with her embarrassment , her dark eyes searching his . " Will there be any fuss when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' to ask for some kind of proof Henry and me were married ? " " No , it 'll be all right , " Frank answered . " They wo n't question you . " " Mama , Mama ! " The cry in the darkened adjoining room came frightened from the edge of a dream . " Mama , you out there ? " A frantic , sleepy voice cried for reassurance . " You go to sleep , Mama 's here . " Soothingly she answered the call for protection . Then her thin arms went about her stomach ,  | trying to hold herself together for a moment longer , and her head lowered to the table . They shut the door gently and stood outside in the darkness hearing the halting cry ; then quietly , as if embarrassed that they were listening , they started down the steps .  | A warring party of young hoods , black dew rags tied about their straightened hair like arrogant shields of self-esteem , walked the hot night looking for sport , but the sentinel 's hand came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They had spotted an enemy . Lowering their heads , they walked past , trying to hold on to their swaggering cool . But it was a sham . They turned thankfully at the corner and disappeared . The laughter and talk of the people sitting on stoops , drinking beer out of cans against the late summer heat , had subdued into a hush of Harlem hip . Two lovers moved apprehensively out of the shadows of a building , the boy looking nervously over his shoulder ; and he banged into a strung-out junkie , almost knocking him against the nondescript sedan with the big antenna . When the junkie looked up , his habit was down on him , and alarm spread across the cocoa-skinned face as he blinked at the men who stared at him through the front window of the car . He stood still , unable to move , his fingers scratching the wide , everitchy nostrils , then he turned awkwardly and stumbled away . The detectives were still wrapped in sullenness , remembering the grieving woman and a lead that had led nowhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the dashboard radio . But they did n't notice it , their ears attuned only to their squeal number ; the rest meant nothing .  | Bill Pope took a long pull on a cigarette and out of the corner of his eye looked at his partner . Sullivan 's reddish face was shadowed by his hat brim , but the street lamp threw enough light into the car to illuminate the irritated tic at the edge of the jawline and the brooding , deep-set eyes . Pope knew why the street gang cooled it when they passed , why the boy with the girl was so concerned and what made the addict get so frightened . Sullivan had the kind of face the Negroes viewed with trepidation . They had seen it before over Southern badges marked " Deputy " or " Sheriff " or " Chief , " or over Northern numbers in silver pinned on blue shirts and coats . Pope flipped the butt into the street , annoyed with himself for letting his thoughts take off in such a flight . This was no up-North Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a few minutes ago touched by kindness . After all , was n't he The Man , too ? Harlem was looking at him as much as they were looking at Sullivan and maybe with more hate . For he stared back at them from a black skin . People passed in singles and couples , their eyes glancing furtively toward the car , sharp to the law sitting ominously quiet on scabrous side streets . " Watch your step , man , watch out . They 're on a stakeout . They 're bustin ' everybody who looks suspicious tonight . Or maybe  --  yeah , yeah , that could be it  --  they just waitin ' for a payoff . You know what I mean , man . Like business as usual . Like they 're bagmen for the precinct . It no matter though ; you still watch out . " Sullivan had watched the lanky youth pressing his body against the girl , moving under the shadow of a stoop in a cadence oblivious to the surroundings . Then the boy , somehow sensing they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the hand away from threatening eyes . Through the windshield , the addict with his gaping mouth and bulging eyes appeared to him like something flushed from beneath the rocks , floundering , death creasing the brown face , then as quickly being washed from view by a wave of panic . The bells of Our Lady of Lourdes , a couple of blocks away , rang through discordant streets , and its dirgelike tolling sounded so strangely similar to the retreat bells of the abbey that the miserable street on which they were parked seemed to disappear .  | Frank Sullivan could visualize the gentle countryside , and a monastery almost isolated from the world .... He had tried to drown the voices with whiskey , but out of the hollows of empty bottles he heard their laughter , their faces vibrant with life , and then the frightened aftermath : a stalled truck , a car skidding and slamming metal into metal , and then deadly silence . The scene would come at him drunk or sober , repeating its dreadful sequence over and over . At last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cloistered . He knelt with other troubled outsiders , hunching forward with clasped hands across wooden pews and praying to a nailed Christ stretched and bleeding above the altar . He listened to the monks talk of afflicted life and the salvaging hereafter . He sought their counsel and submerged himself in meditation , prayer and tranquillity . Then slowly , slowly , the remorse began to drain away , the frequency of seeing their faces , of hearing their voices and tasting the salt of his grief gave way to a melancholy he could endure and the knowledge that a lifetime on his knees could never completely erase the guilt and that time and activity were the best cure of all . But his working world was called Harlem . He had approached his return to active duty with misgivings , his controlled emotions in doubt . It was too easy in this repellent boxed-in ghetto to flail out , to indict others and cover it with neurotic rationalization . Control , control . Play it by ear . Now he could feel the bad taste in his mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whiskey had put there . His mind ran back up the cancerous steps , past the locked door and into the room where the woman sat with bowed head . It all seemed a waste : the retreat , the prayers , the acceptance of his grief . It was as if he had deceived himself with elaborate lies . If a black woman who meant nothing to him was capable of ripping away that easily the careful veneer he had built around himself , he knew it was going to take a long and painful time before he could really come back . He could feel the paradoxical anger as he watched the people passing along the sidewalk , some like primed peacocks but most with the head-down shuffle of struggles long given up . He thought of their exploiters , the dope dealers making addicts ,  | numbers runners and strong-arm guys who worked their bags on human frailty . And Doc Johnson , the biggest black bastard of them all , sitting high on top of the heap of Harlem punks thinking he could n't be reached because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name around in his mind . Johnson . Johns ? His churn of frustration was suddenly arrested by an exciting idea , a haphazard whim . It was balls and crazy and was just the thing that might be expected of him . But under the circumstances , yeah , it could work . He could feel a fever sweep through him as if his body accepted the risk before his mind did . Yeah , just the right amount of pressure properly applied could do it . But it has to be done right now , now , now . He was about to turn to Pope to voice his speculations when cold reason washed over him . Bill Pope might not want to take such a gamble , for to lose could be hazardous to his ambition , maybe even end his career in the Department before it ever really began . He knew his partner liked the plain clothes of a third grade rank and the times were right for the Bill Popes . The Negro with a college education could look past promotion to first grade detective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rarefied air of an inspector 's world . He knew Pope had the brain and ambition that could capitalize on the new interest New York 's liberal politicians had in such men as he . Now more than ever they needed to showcase ebony talent to the city 's million blacks . Sullivan was aware of the talk that was whispered behind his back , of his reputation for seeking out trouble . But he also was known for making the big arrest , the kind that could mean immediate recognition , the kind that made third grade plainclothesmen into first grade detectives overnight . Now he intended to work this on his partner . He was going to use him , he had to , for to go it alone would be to court the danger of political reprisal . What he needed was a strong witness to what he intended to do , and if it turned bad , someone with enough guts to back up his play . A kid not more than seven , wearing torn sneakers and shorts , halted in his mad dash of night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body , he looked into the squad car . He  | stood there , brows knitting , as if debating whether to shoot the bad guys . Then he turned and ran off into a garbage-littered lot near the end of the block . Frank stuck a cigarette in his mouth , his hands going around the match . He took a long drag before he looked at Pope . " Of all the guys in the precinct working on this case , I would say we have the hottest lead so far . But I do n't think we have a chance of catching up to whoever done it . " His voice gave no indication of what he was driving at . He looked away . " Oh , we might see them but I think we 'd have to take a ride down to Bellevue 's morgue to get a real close look . Because if they 're found , they 're strictly going to be DOAs . " Bill Pope sat quietly , weighing Frank 's pessimism . " I do n't know , " he answered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're inclined to believe this Jackson 's part of it . Maybe somebody else in the squad is working from a fresh angle and could be breathing down Harris 's neck right now . That is if it 's him . Look , somebody could get lucky . Maybe it could even be us . Who knows ? " Frank blew out a stream of smoke indifferently . It hung for a moment about their heads , then worked its way out of the car windows . " I think we 're going to have to make our own luck if we want to turn up any action on this . We got to start throwin ' our weight around , and I do n't mean against some punk stoolie . " Pope was bothered . He knew obscurity was not Sullivan 's style and he respected him for it . " If you have something , Frank , let 's hear it . " He stuck a needle in his tone and watched it pull the white face around . " I got a hunch , " Frank said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realize that better than ninety percent of hunches are horseshit , but I know who I can book this one with . How do you feel about playing long shots ? " " You should know me by now , Frank . I do n't go by form . " " You may very well this time , because we 'd be running against an odds-on chasing . Johnson can buy a hundred informers for every one a guy in the squad can scare up . He 's got a working capital that has bought a lot of people , even some we work with . " Sullivan did not sound bitter ; this was stated as fact . But what  | he did n't say was implied : that black responded to black , and in particular that a success symbol as outstanding as Doc Johnson was far more formidable to the people of Harlem than the police , white or black . Pope had been witness to a few of Frank Sullivan 's hunches ' working out in the past . But his gnawing doubt persisted . This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whim . Too many important people in the Department were watching , and Frank had given him no substance ; for they had no actual clues to connect with Doc Johnson . Pope spoke quietly . " Frank , I heard a lot of things about that man and one of them is that he 's no fool . I 've got to presume you know what you 're doing , because if we start to suggest that he committed a retaliatory murder we would n't have a legal leg to stand on if he hollers for a lawyer . " Sullivan ground out the cigarette in the dashboard tray . Pope 's caution bothered him . But he was determined to give it another try , for by now he felt it was too good an idea to let die from cautious talk . " Bill , I 'm going to try something that was never pulled on him before . I guess you could call it reverse extortion ? and maybe I wo n't be able to back up everything I 'm going to tell him . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person he wants to see walk in on him , because he ca n't afford a boatrocker who 's trying to throw him to the sharks . Not tonight he ca n't . I 'm telling you , Bill , the more I think about this the better I smell a deal . And if it works it could be one of the best collars we could ever hope to make . It 's the type of thing that pulls publicity . A bright guy like you , just starting out , he sure could use it as a steppingstone . " Pope had always guarded against revealing any personal goals , for it was too easy for a man to be tagged by his failures ; the precinct and the Department were loaded with those who had . Until now he 'd thought this white man knew nothing of his aspirations . But here was Sullivan openly , bluntly working on his ambitions , digging into what Pope had thought were hopes buried deep in the privacy of his own mind . He had underestimated his partner ; had he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street had become oddly quiet . A few stoops down , the beer drinkers had drifted off to a more congenial atmosphere , away from a couple of intent detectives staring moodily out of a squad car . " Before you say anything , Bill , " Sullivan said , as if measuring the words , " I want you to know I detest the black son of a bitch . But I 'm not using it as an excuse to pay off an old debt . Because there could be a loser 's side to this gamble , far beyond just no deal . I already got some scars from his string pulling , so I 'll be straight with you . If this thing turns bad and if he wants to , he could hurt us . And you , being new , can be hurt a hell of a lot more than me . There are a couple of gold shields down in Centre Street that I think I can hide behind until Johnson stops throwing his political bombs around . But you could end up a casualty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this blunt , single-minded man , over an idea that at very best was a long shot . It sounded as if he was being given a choice , but there was no choice . He resented being forced into an awkward position , with no out , for no matter how he answered there would be a transformation in their relationship . In fact , Sullivan 's impatient probing had already changed it . Pope was silent too long and Sullivan felt let down . He tried to keep the disappointment out of his voice . " It 's too wild . Yeah . " His hand went around the steering wheel as if he was about to start the car . " Yeah , it could be too big a gamble . Like I said , the most sensible thing to do is forget it . " " You 're full of surprises , Frank , " Bill Pope said evenly . " I could sit here and give you a half dozen more reasons why we should n't take Johnson on . But I do n't think you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had you figured out at last , but you keep on slipping out of the mold . I guess I could give myself a couple of easy cliches why you want to buck the odds , but I do n't think they 'd cover you on this . " He paused and seemed to sigh . " Okay , Frank , " he said quietly , " you want it this way , we 'll see Johnson . I 'll back up your play . " If he had known of the hate that simmered in his partner , of the retaliation that Sullivan had been subconsciously preparing for and was still trying to conceal from himself by lying now  | about the merits of longshots and gambling , Bill would have held his silence , would have let him drive off in the opposite direction from Doc Johnson , and would have let this white think whatever thoughts he wanted to about his black partner .  | In the blackness the shrill laughter echoed down and his head twisted frantically in the darkness for an escape . He covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reverberating and tearing at his senses . Suddenly a grisly light materialized out of the darkness . The laughter ceased . He could see a dingy figure stumble toward him from far back . The rough black face , brutal and violent in its drunkenness , lurched to a stop . It was then that he recognized the craggy head . But the eyes were different , strange and sad , as though they did n't belong to this man in a rage , raising his arm in fury . " No , " he whimpered , " no , Pop . It 's me , Jamesy . It 's me , it 's me . " And he reached up , tenderly grasping for the elusive distress in the broken face that at last he understood . But as suddenly as it appeared , the screen darkened and he twisted and turned in the blackness . " Where are you , Pop ? Where are you ? " But all he could hear were the muffled cries of children . Pitiable , tear-stained cries . The sounds were behind him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front row of wooden chairs . They sat mourning the frail body encased in a casket that was no more than a wooden box . A single bouquet of flowers was at its feet and the preacher mumbled the eulogy to a handful of blacks . An older sister held the youngest in her lap and a distressed little boy at the end looked familiar . He walked past them and stared down into the box ,  | down at the cheap dress covering the haggard remains , the face powdered like a clown 's . Compulsively he bent down , his lips seeking the dead . Then a hollow knock and as he looked up he was in a kitchen with children crowded about a table . The knock again and the oldest sister rose nervously , her finger motioning across her mouth for silence and remembered behavior before she would open the door . And the white man with his black leather book walked around the winter-cold rooms taking his inventory , asking his questions and making his check marks . He scowled at the demolished drunk lying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shamefully at the floor while the children she had cautioned peered wide-eyed from the other room . Their shame and impoverishment was being exposed by the man from Welfare . Incensed , he shouted , " Get out . Get out . " And he rushed at the man , but nobody heard him , nobody knew he was there . The crash of laughter returned , tumbling him back into his pit of darkness . But he could still hear knocking , pausing , then coming on again . He opened his eyes , still caught on a periphery of dreams , his body beaded in sweat , his mouth dry . Then he heard it again , this time not so blatant , its restraint sending shivers of apprehension up from his bowels . He rolled silently off the bed , stood in the darkness , the pounding of his heart filling his ears . His hand groped back to the bed and found the gun . His finger flicked off the safety . The click , in his mind far too loud , rebounded off the walls . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen , but the break of worn wood betrayed his movement , freezing him . He held his breath . The gun , clammy and slippery in his hands , rose and pointed at the door ; his finger tightened about the trigger . " Jim , " he heard the imploring voice through the door . " Jim , open up . It 's me , Ivy . " His body went slack and he stood tasting the bile of his fear . Then he took a deep breath and unbolted the door . She held back in the darkened hall as if afraid to step into the room , afraid to confront him . The faint light sneaking in through the window behind him glimmered on the hard , metallic submachine gun in his hand . " Oh , my God , Jim ! " Her voice was a throb that pulled her into  | the room , her arms extending toward him . But he brushed past her , shut and rebolted the door . She stood there , afraid to speak , intently watching him turn on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table , which made his shadow loom against the opposite wall . Pushing the safety back on the gun , he placed it on the table next to the bag of money . She stared for long seconds at the bulky duffel , but for her it did not have the reality of the gun ; the bag was too full , too fat to contain anything of value . And if it were n't for the greenish bills showing through , it could have been a bag of dirty laundry . " The police were over to the club to see me , " she whispered , and saw the muscles tighten through his sweat-stained T-shirt . " It 's okay , honey . It 's all right . Nobody knows I 'm here . They were two plainclothesmen . I do n't know how they connected us , but it did n't seem they had much to go on , and I ? " She stopped , her voice breaking into a sob . She remained silent until she had control of herself . " I 'm sure I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come back to question me , at least not for a while anyway . And then it wo n't matter . " He turned and looked at her impassively . " When the detectives told me what had happened , I wanted to run . I wanted to run up here and prove them wrong because I never thought you 'd go through with it . " She shook her head as though searching for the words that would clarify her disbelief . " I  --  I never knew how serious you really were . I thought all this thinkin ' and plannin ' was just wild talk , somethin ' you would let go after you seen how crazy it all was . I never took it like it was .... " He moved away from her , walked to the window . His hand pulled back the edge of the shade as he leaned against the frame and stared out to the tenements on the next street . " We did n't need it , Jim . We coulda made out okay . " In the humid heat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said you were through with it all , the rackets , the hustle . You told me that , and now this terrible thing . " The cadence of late tenement flowed across to him from the other buildings . " Why , Jim ? Why did you go through with it when you knew it was insane ? " He turned away from the depressing sights and sounds  | and smells . " Insane , " he said , examining the word for honesty . " Yeah , maybe you 're right . Maybe I am a crazy man grabbin ' for somethin ' that would n't cross a normal cat 's mind , somethin ' so far up in the sky that for the last few weeks I could barely sleep or eat for thinkin ' about it . Thinkin ' that I lose my cool , make one little slip , I 'm gon na be a dead man . But I still went for it ' cause I could taste it . I gambled it all  --  you , me , the future  --  on one big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I won , Ivy " ? his hand motioned to the money ? " and so did you , baby . It 's all gon na turn around for us now . You 'll see . Everything 's gon na be fine . " " How good can it be when I see you like you were a few minutes ago , " she said , " standin ' there with that gun in your hand and your insides all flarin ' up and it all showin ' in your face ? You talk about a future , but the cops they seem to think you done it , and the people you took the money off of , they ai n't just goin ' to forget it . Do we build a normal existence on that kinda worry ? You tell me , Jim : how far we goin ' to run on top of dead men ? " " What the hell you want , Ivy ? " he asked embitteredly , his voice rising . " You sound like you want me to give up . Is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I just want you to save yourself , honey . " Her tone grew mollifying . " This thing is  --  it 's too big for me . I do n't know what to think or even say to you . " Her voice trailed off . She averted her eyes and sat down despondently at the table , rummaging through her plastic handbag . He watched her nervous hands struggle to light a cigarette . " Ivy . " She looked up at him . " You sound like ninety-nine percent of all the blacks I ever knew when they come on something big . It 's the same cry : Man , man , I ca n't make it . " His mouth twisted with disgust . " They been niggers so goddamn long they think black . I just did it all , made the kind of grand slam score any thief in the world would be proud of , and you come runnin ' scared in here tellin ' me I do n't have much of a chance to make it all the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I do n't need no sermon on what 'll happen to me if I 'm caught . " Perspiration clung to her upper lip as she took a long  | drag . " I expected more , a lot more than that from you , Ivy . I always think you a step and a half ahead of the pack and now you come on like some black bitch cow , too shocked to dig what 's goin ' on . Well , baby , you knew what I was up to right along . ' Cause I did n't fill you in minute by minute do n't make you clean , so do n't you get holy on me now . " The abrasive sounds of tenement seemed to suspend into unusual quietness as if everything ceased , waiting for her answer to this angry man standing before her . " Yes , " she whispered to him , " yes , I 'm real shocked . " There were tears in her eyes . " Not because you stole , that do n't bother me . I been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only difference between you and them is that you did it big . Maybe I should give you credit the way you went out and took it . But that 's just the thing that scares me . I 'd 've bet my life that the Jim Harris I knew was n't no guy to kill the way I hear you did . I guess I just do n't really know what make you go inside . I thought I did , but now you plain frighten me . The change it 's been too quick and I just do n't understand it . " Her disconsolate indictment of his violence melted his anger . He wanted to go to her , to put his arms tenderly about the slim body so she would n't slip further away from him , to continue to soothe her with lies about how nothing had changed . " I did n't want to hurt no one , Ivy . You got ta believe that . " He had to make her understand , see it through his eyes , feel it as he remembered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could get at them with surprise . Be in and out of there without firin ' a shot . You know what I mean , quick-like , and no cops in it . That the last thing I wanted . Like I told you before , I did n't lose my nerve ? Well , I did . I know that now , yeah , because I should been able to handle it better up there . But that room was too hot . I felt like I was chokin ' . I ... " He seemed to leave her , his eyes moving above her head , seeing it all happen once again . He continued to talk , but so soft that she had to lean toward him . " It was the money , Ivy . It was my pot of gold layin ' out in fives and tens and twenties , all just piled there just waitin ' for me . More than one year plannin ' and the minute I walk in that room sure God I knew it was mine and they have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about this thing so long , figurin ' every angle , everything except what happened . And when it come at me I could n't handle it because I was lookin ' at all that money , only this time it was for real . And then somebody decided to stop me . " His eyes closed against the playback that was so vivid in his mind . He swayed there before her , hearing again the sounds of the dying and seeing again the blurred , startled faces in the blue uniforms just before they fell . " If only I believed you when you told me , " she whispered . " I do n't know how , but I 'd have stopped you from goin ' through with it . I would 've showed you we did n't need a lot of money for us to make a life together . " Her tawny face was sad for the dreams of her tomorrows . " Even if you stayed workin ' for Doc Johnson with the worry of you bein ' picked up by the law and doin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it still would be better than what we got us . " " Ivy , when I got busted and done that year I laid awake nights doin ' a lot of thinkin ' . You know what I mean : like I thought about you and me and where we headin ' ; for the first time in my life I seen myself and it was no good because what I seen was nothin ' but small-time nigger muscle and I knew I would n't be anything more than a scaler when I get out , no matter how I hustled . Doc Johnson could pick my type off of any corner any night . I was holdin ' on to the real low rung of a ladder , and now with a rap against me I was n't even sure of stayin ' there . I was the kind of cat the cops pick up and work over . " His voice was so sharply bitter that it was as if he were cutting himself open for her to see the flaws inside . " When you come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you I was through with it , that there would n't be no more , I meant it , every word . But I was n't quittin ' to be no porter , cleanin ' up after some goddamn white man ; not this boy . " Slowly he took a step toward her . " I hear somebody say once , Anything you ai n't never had you never miss . ' Ivy , that is one damn lie . I wanted a lotta things I never had and I was goin ' for them in one big grab . It was either that or die tryin ' . And I did it , baby , I did it . I made it work . And now I 'm quittin ' , but on my own terms . "  | The sounds of tenement now started to pick at their privacy : the muffled , wanting cry of a baby , and somewhere across the yards canned laughter from a TV set . " Yeah , you 're one smart man , Jim , but I do n't have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few other things . " She shook her head sadly , slowly . " No , you got a lot more to offer than bein ' a porter . If you put your mind to it you could 've done so many things ; you'd 've latched on to the right job . It was all just a matter of time . Sooner or la ? " " Like what , huh ? " His voice was a harsh grating sound that barreled frustratingly up from deep within his chest . " Doin ' what ? Like workin ' in a car wash , or maybe deliverin ' coffee for a downtown restaurant to one of them big office buildings ? " He raised his arms as he took a step further into the light . " Look at me , Ivy . Just look at me . A thirty-four-year-old nigger with no schoolin ' , no trade , and an ex-convict . Who the hell would want me for anythin ' but swingin ' a pick ? Get out of your whitewoman dream world , baby . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never goin ' ta change by me goin ' straight . It would be one shit job after another and you 'd still be workin ' in that club , still bein ' propositioned every night and , baby , when we get up tight with money , and that would be like from the start , I 'm gon na tell you to bed down with some of them cats because I 'm goin ' to have you out whorin ' . " He turned from her and began to pace the shadowed kitchen . " Or maybe I 'd start dealin ' drugs on some street corner . Yeah , it would be either that or me back with a gun lookin ' for a small quick buck ' cause I 'd be tryin ' to hold on to some kinda manhood . " He moved about almost silently in his stocking feet like an irritated caged animal . " And where we goin ' ta live ? Tell me that , huh ? " His hand swept about the room . " In some stinkin ' trap like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' cause I do n't think you ever have . And come winter you goin ' ta be pushin ' rags around the windows and under the door to keep from freezin ' . Yeah , I done a lot o ' thinkin ' when they bust me for that year . I turned it over , tried to see it from your side , rememberin ' all the crap you used to tell me . But no matter how hard I looked , I could n't see us goin ' no higher than the gutter . "  | He moved into the light . " In six months we 'd be at each other 's throats , in a year we 'd be through . And that was just about the last thing I wanted to happen . " His hands reached out tenderly to her face and his fingers moved gently across the slender hollows and down along the delicate firmness of her jaw . The weeks and days and hours of anxious preparation and then the unstrung climactic strike that left him with memories he could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The armor he had encased himself into melted from the heat of tears burning in his eyes . Suddenly all the strain , all the terrible guilt caved him to his knees . " Ivy , Ivy honey , I 'm scared . " He could taste his tears and his hands grasped her waist . She sat there staring down at his head burrowed into her lap , not quite believing the transformation , for there had never been anything in the past to indicate that this tough-minded man would ever expose his frailties or break down . All her thoughts about what had happened and her fear of the immediate dangers that stalked them disappeared . Maternally her arms went about him , pressing him closer to her . At that moment there were no bad dreams ; no sitting alone at the table facing the door with a gun in his lap , his insides jaggedly turning at every sound , his eyes , heavy with fatigue , watching the roaches move across the table as rats scurried in the sink , gnawing at the crusts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head dipping toward sleep and fitful dreams . Tears ran down her face and her arms stayed protectively about him . In the doleful light they clung to each other , She lived in three rooms in a middle-class building just off Riverside Drive . It had a doorman and an air of respectability and it was worth the high rent that she could barely meet each month . She 'd been late that day and she had dressed hurriedly and come straight to the club and her job : flashing her legs at black rubes who would pony up a dollar and a quarter a shot for watered-down whiskey ; tight dresses and suggestive talk ; then fighting off the squares who thought she was available . " The men want to speak to you , baby , " the manager had said . " You got a little evil bag goin ' on the side , honey ? " He smiled , but she could see his annoyance at having the law sitting out  | front . She was sure as she approached , watching the young Negro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was not a premonition or some kind of psychic knowledge . Had n't she heard the story often enough ? All the twisted talk : Jim had picked the two that were going to help him and he was setting up one to take the fall . Jimmy Harris 's Sky Pie Plan . It was just something to build himself up with , and that was all right , because it would pass , because nobody would ... She felt her legs go weak as the white detective turned to look at her . He stared and she felt certain he was in no hurry to go anyplace , but was there just to tell her her Jim was dead . How she made it to the stool she did n't know . Hiding behind the slow act of lighting a cigarette , afraid her fear would show , then elated : " He 's alive , he 's alive , " the words almost bursting out in thankfulness . She had to go to him . Maybe he 's hurt . Maybe he 's ... But not now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bogused a smile , listening to the big dude customer at the bar until her nerve ends were jagged from being chipped away by the movements of the clock . Finally the anxiety was too much and she left , Eddie the manager disgruntled by her sudden sickness . Walking against the traffic , afraid of being followed , she watched the street for the fuzz while her thoughts raced ahead to her Jimbo , knowing her hopes had been kicked in the stomach . Hopes put together from his words through wire mesh in the Rikers Island prison . " No more , baby . From now on things are goin ' to be different . We 're goin ' to make it . You 'll see . " She banked his optimism , putting it toward expectations of a new life , in which their two legitimate salaries would combine to pull them out of the swill and satisfy her passion for respectability , move them into the middle-income life of the newly emerging Negro . But his release had buried her dreams under an avalanche of plot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to awaken to reality , never really believing he would dare go through with it . At the corner she had cased the street , trying to assess the parked cars hugging the curb for the one or two that might be on a stakeout . " Hey , mama , you lookin ' for a good time ? " a big teen-ager had said , laughing , and he gestured with the forefinger  | of his right hand , which brought dirty laughter from other boys standing with him outside a candy store . To Ivy the street was nothing . Radios blared from passing cars , but the music was like a dirge without beat . The people moved lethargically in the summer heat , oblivious and lost in thought . Cautiously she walked a block past the tenement , stopped for another look around , and then came back . As she had climbed upstairs , her tears turned the steps into muddled pools , and she knocked ... . He jerked in her arms and cocked his head warningly toward the door , letting go of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he listened to the sounds of footsteps climbing closer . Then a door closed on the floor below . Commonplace sounds had turned into threats . Sounds he had never even noticed now battered at his nerves , shouting their nonexistent dangers . He was only an arm 's length away , but he appeared distant and distorted . Ivy knew his moment of dependence had passed . He was again the vigilant , frightened man she had seen earlier in the darkened room ready to use the ugly gun . " It 's okay , honey . It 's all right , " she whispered , knowing the reassuring words were falsehoods she did n't believe herself . " I guess maybe I helped shape what happened tonight . With all my real fancy talk about a bright new future , you went out and did somethin ' about it . I guess I was cheerin ' you on all the time , Jimmy , and did n't know it until now . And now that it 's here , " Well , you still hold on to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gently . " I think we goin ' to need some of it , ' cause things have been happenin ' that make some of my figurin ' dead . Logart 's been here and tells me Henry 's hittin ' the sauce . He 's startin ' to shoot his mouth off . " " Ai n't that what you wanted him to do ? " Her brow furrowed . " You said you wanted him to cover you with a lot of drinkin ' and talk . Did n't you tell me that , did n't you ? " " Yeah , I did . But he 's bustin ' up the scheme . I had him thought out right but he 's comin ' on too soon . I ca n't take the chance now of sittin ' it out here like I wanted . That 's why I 'm dividin ' tomorrow . I 'm givin ' Logart his cut in the mornin ' and
