A FAIRY TALE OF NEW YORK <P> by J.P . DONLEAVY <P> 341 pages . Delacorte. $7.95 . <P> From The Ginger Man on , J.P . Donleavy 's novels have been simultaneously cruel , sentimental , repetitive and sporadically funny . Donleavy heroes are ridiculous figures who wallow in self-pity behind their mannered fronts and anesthetize deep personal hurts with sex and alcohol . Like Cornelius Treacle Christian , the errant knight in tweed armor of A Fairy Tale of New York , Donleavy 's people move around a lot- " Moving all the time , " says Christian , " hoping for a master stroke of solace somewhere . " <P> Treacle Christian ( the name alone too obviously signals Donleavy 's intent ) is a penniless , Bronx-born expatriate who returns to New York from Europe where he has been highly schooled and polished . The inadvisability of his return is made quite evident at the beginning when his wife , a delicate hot-house beauty , dies during the ocean crossing . The implication is that rare and fine things do not travel well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is alternately tempting and repulsive , " one monstrous insult to the delicate spirit . " A funeral director gladly offers to forget the bill for burying Christian 's wife if he will come to work as a front man at the mortuary . An industrialist thinks he can use a little class in the jingle department . <P> All these opportunities come to bad ends because Christian 's outrage keeps breaking through his overcourteous exterior . He tells off brand-new widows who complain about their dead husbands ' makeup . He is too quick with his fists , which are surprisingly effective . Yet Donleavy 's New Yorkers are thorough professionals , blunt and disturbingly honest about their own illusions . Unfortunately , Donleavy is rather slippery about his own illusions . The city , he seems to be saying ( especially when he pumps his prose full of Celtic twilight ) , is no place for a wandering Christian . <P> <P> THE TANGO BRIEFING <P> by ADAM HALL <P> 277 pages . Doubleday . $6.95 . <P> With four speedy , intricate spy novels behind him , Adam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the genre . In this latest case , Superagent Quiller applies his spectacular professional skills toward the saving of Britain 's face in the Middle East . The plot is Hall 's most extravagant yet ; Quiller takes on two enemy spy groups , the North African desert and a tactical nuclear device . He inhales nerve gas , makes two parachute jumps , and gets pecked by vultures . <P> Indeed , Hall seems to have forsaken the mysterious side of espionage , at least partly , in favor of technological high jinks . In the course of the novel , the careful reader will learn about the physical properties of telescopic rifles , soaring , nighttime airborne dead reckoning with a computer assist , and highspeed driving . Hall is also expansive on the techniques of clandestine radio communication . <P> Hall 's characters are forgettable , but as a stylist the author seems to be working toward a new kind of thriller rhetoric . His best trick is the no-transition paragraph that picks up not where the action left off but two paragraphs of conventional narration later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the overall effect makes him feel that he is the one out there in the desert with the vultures . <P> <P> SEARCHES &; SEIZURES <P> by STANLEY ELKIN
