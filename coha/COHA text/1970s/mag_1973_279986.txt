Moving nimbly to the aid of motorists , the Government 's Environmental Protection Agency last week published a fuel-economy rundown on every 1973 auto , foreign or domestic , sold in the U.S. The results were painfully predictable : gas mileage drops with every pound of weight and power accessory . Says Eric Stork , Deputy Assistant Administrator for Mobile Source Air Pollution Control : " Far and away the easiest way of reducing fuel consumption is to drive smaller and lighter cars and use less air conditioning . " <P> EPA tested the cars at its laboratory in Ann Arbor , Mich . Autos were placed on a chassis dynamometer ( a device consisting of recording gauges linked to two large cylinders set parallel in a floor ; a car is moved onto the cylinders , and its drive wheels move them during the test ) and theoretically piloted over a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed a computer-prepared strip chart at an average speed of 35 m.p.h . <P> Foreign cars delivered both the best and the worst results , but the range even for U.S. makes was startling . A sampling of the results for cars fairly representative of their types , in descending order of economy : <P> Datsun 1200 ( 71.5-cu. - in. engine , manual transmission ) , 28.7 m.p.g. , the best performance of any auto tested . <P> Volkswagen Sedan ( 96.6-cu. - in. engine , manual transmission ) , 23.6 m.p.g . <P> Chevrolet Vega ( 140-cu. - in. engine , manual transmission ) , 21.5 m.p.g . <P> Ford Pinto ( 98-cu. - in. engine , manual transmission ) , 21.4 m.p.g . <P> Toyota Corolla ( 97-cu. - in. engine , manual transmission ) , 20.8 m.p.g . <P> American Motors Gremlin ( 232-cu. - in. engine , manual transmission ) , 18 m.p.g . <P> Dodge Charger ( 318-cu. - in. engine , automatic transmission ) , 12.2 m.p.g . <P> Chevrolet Impala ( 454-cu. - in. engine , automatic transmission ) , 10.1 m.p.g . <P> Chrysler Imperial ( 440-cu. - in. engine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 440-cu. - in. engine , automatic transmission ) , 8.7 m.p.g . <P> Oldsmobile 98 ( 455-cu. - in. engine , automatic transmission ) , 8.9 m.p.g . <P> Cadillac Eldorado ( 500-cu. - in. engine , automatic transmission ) , 8.1 m.p.g . <P> Ferrari 365 GTB ( 268-cu. - in. engine , manual transmission ) , 6.3 m.p.g. , the worst figure for any car .
