LADIES AT THE ALAMO by PAULZINDEL <P> There are dragon ladies breathing fire on the stage of Broadway 's Martin Beck Theater . Paul Zindel has conceived of a raw , strident all-woman power struggle for control of a regional theater called the " Alamo " in Texas City , Texas . The bitchy confrontations in his play make the feline spats in Clare Boothe Luce 's The Women sound like the popping of ladyfingers . <P> The chief monster woman , Dede Cooper ( Estelle Parsons ) , is a pioneer zealot of regional theater , and she has nursed the Alamo into its present quarters , a huge Gothic pile . Dede can squash mountains as though they were bugs , but she has a doughty foe in a widowed moneybags named Joanne Remington ( Rosemary Murphy ) , who believes that when money talks , Dede should shut up . Joanne 's plan is to install a codirector , Shirley Fuller ( Jan Farrand ) , who will siphon off Dede 's authority . <P> Operation Overkill sets in , but the play is weak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand out . Eileen Heckart is a thorough delight as Dede 's pal Bella Gardner , a swaying lush more avidly at home in bedrooms than boardrooms . In the juiciest part , Estelle Parsons blows through the play like a typhoon . <P> Director Frank Perry commands everyone 's best work . When the evening is over , one longs for the cozy serenity of Lear 's blasted heath .
