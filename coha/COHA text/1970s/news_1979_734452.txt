txt What now about Chappaquiddick ? Is it an issue in the 1980 campaign ? Obviously . But what , precisely , is the issue ? Is the episode only one of many private tragedies that have revealed and shaped the character of Edward Kennedy ? Or is some unfinished public business lurking there , bearing even more directly on his fitness to be President ? There ought to be no hesitation to rake over this puzzling affair . Americans no longer accept any clear distinction between the private and public lives of their leaders . They have debated the religious faith of John Kennedy , the finances of Richard Nixon , the romantic fantasies of Jimmy Carter . Only the sturdiest characters are thought able to deal with the tensions and temptations of the Presidency ; those who seek it invite dissection by the crowd . ? Mr. Kennedy says he became " irrational " at Chappaquiddick , but in response to a shock that no President is likely to encounter . He says he was " irresponsible , " but legally so only by delaying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " unforgivable , " but adds that it profoundly altered his values in ways the voters should now respect . His account of the episode has not changed in ten years : The Senator and five other men gave a party for six younger women who had worked in Robert Kennedy 's Presidential campaign . . . . They drank , but moderately . . . . Around midnight , Mr. Kennedy and one of the women , Mary Jo Kopechne , drove off together headed for separate hotels , took a sharp wrong turn onto a bumpy dirt road and ran off a narrow bridge . . . . The car landed upside down in six or eight feet of pond water . Miss Kopechne died . Mr. Kennedy says he kept diving to find her , then ran back to summon two friends and had them dive too . Promising to inform the police , he says he finally swam off across a 500-foot channel to his hotel on Martha 's Vineyard but reported nothing . He returned to Chappaquiddick the next morning and , after learning that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police . A week later , Mr. Kennedy pleaded guilty to leaving an accident and retold the story on television . The judge who presided over a closed inquest expressed doubt about key elements of the Senator 's sworn testimony ? notably about his destination that night ? and found probable cause for a charge of negligence , possibly criminal . But the Senator was never rigorously cross-examined ; none of several interested prosecutors ever pressed other charges . He received a suspended two-month sentence plus probation and lost his driver 's license for a year . He made an undisclosed financial settlement with Miss Kopechne 's parents . President Carter has implied that the episode shows Mr. Kennedy to be unreliable in crisis . Yet the Senator has faced other crises , including the assassination of two brothers , a difficult marriage , a plane crash , a son 's cancer . In these tests he has also been portrayed as a long-suffering , compassionate human being . It is hard to think of any candidate , or President , whose emotional trials have been so well known . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as decorous as claimed , or where the Senator and his passenger were headed that night . His failure to seek competent help , out of panic or cruel calculation , was much more serious . And the Senator 's success in avoiding tough cross-examination remains , politically , the most serious matter of all . More important now than the loose ends of his unsatisfying accounts are the reasons they were left so loose . If Mr. Kennedy used his enormous influence to protect himself and his career by leading a cover-up of misconduct ? and the known facts lead to that suspicion ? there would hang over him not just a cloud of tragedy but also one of corruption , of the Watergate kind . And as we know from Watergate , there is no graver question for a President than whether he can be trusted to respect the law . All those who had anything to do with the Chappaquiddick affair and its aftermath owe the nation an accounting that in a decade , for some reason , they have never had to give .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
