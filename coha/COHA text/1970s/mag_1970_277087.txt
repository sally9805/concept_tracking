Florida has become a prime example of how Americans love-hate nature . A magnet for new people and industry , the beautiful , booming Sunshine State is also a monument to careless planning . Conservationists have just halted work on a Miami-area jetport that threatened to ruin Everglades National Park . But they are losing to despoiling highways , sprawling developments and coastal landfills that destroy estuaries , the breeding grounds of key marine creatures . The whole state seems to be flirting with ecological disaster . <P> Around Lakeland , phosphate miners are tearing huge holes in the earth that endanger the local water table . At the edge of Big Cypress Swamp , drainage ditches for new housing may interrupt the already imperiled water flow into the Everglades . To the north , Walt Disney Productions is building a City of Tomorrow for 50,000 people that may cut off some of Orlando 's water supply , since the site is atop porous soil that lets rainwater into Florida 's vital aquifer . That underground layer of limestone stores much of the state 's annual 57 inches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let salt water seep in from the sea and contaminate Florida 's lush farm land . <P> For years , towns along Florida 's Gold Coast between Miami and Palm Beach have blithely dumped raw sewage about a mile offshore , assuming that the Gulf Stream would carry it away . Now the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey reports that the cleansing current is farther away than had been thought . As a result , the sewage may actually be trapped right off the hotel-lined beaches . Says Dr. Leonard A. Erdman , president of the Broward County Medical Association : " There is a very real cause to fear the possibility of hepatitis from this situation . " <P> All these problems are currently overshadowed by two pressing issues . One is the Cross-Florida Barge Canal , which is inching across the northern part of the state . Long a dream of the Army Corps of Engineers , the 107-mile waterway will link Jacksonville on the Atlantic with Yankeetown on the Gulf of Mexico . The $177 million project is being heralded by the Army as a major economic asset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In carving out the canal 's first 27 miles , the builders created two dams and a reservoir that have already flooded 13,000 acres of forests in the Oklawaha River basin . Unfortunately , the basin forms a unique " hydric hammock " that abounds with rare alligators , panthers and wild turkeys . The hammock harbors this life because the river bed is periodically exposed to air , thus providing alternating wet and dry seasons that are essential to the survival of the wild , beautiful river-swamp system . With permanent flooding , ecologists warn , the system 's rare creatures will soon vanish . <P> Critics also fear that the canal may pollute groundwater , including the famed Silver Springs , only four miles away from the waterway . Others predict that the Corps of Engineers will eventually try to add other northward canal routes , cutting across the unspoiled Suwannee River .
