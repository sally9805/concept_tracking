If there is a thread that binds the mass of American womanhood into a bloc of seething revolutionaries , it is made of 20-denier nylon-the essence of panty hose . When panty hose appeared in 1965 , they were welcomed as the most important advance in fashion technology since the garter . Lately , the ubiquitous underleggings are drawing the deepening disapprobation of irate wearers . <P> There are problems apanty : bad fit , inscrutable markings and long-distance runs . Of the thousand-odd brands on the market , only a handful are readily recognizable as reliable products of prominent mills . Among the biggest are Burlington , Kayser-Roth and Hanes . The rest , usually identified only by numbers on file with the Federal Trade Commission , are made in both well-known and obscure mills all over the country . Prices range from 59 to $4 , and many women can not see a corresponding difference in quality . Until recently there has been no effort to standardize sizes . Colors are often enigmatically described-as Cafe Brazil , Debonair or Nude-on the outside of hard-to-see-through packages . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrinkle-ankled , Missouri Congresswoman Leonor Sullivan has asked the Federal Trade Commission to investigate the $1.1-billion panty-hose industry . " I got disgusted , " she explained . " Some packages say they fit all , but it 's impossible . You have your tall girls , your short ones . You ca n't have one or even two sizes that fit all . They 're mislabeled . " Mrs. Sullivan has a fast-thickening file of complaining letters from anti-panty women across the country . <P> Senator Philip Hart set his antitrust subcommittee to work on the problem last September . His investigators found that some imports were not designed for American females . Women have complained that Japanese " fit-all " hose may fit all Japanese women , but are as much as three inches short for Americans , and that many German entries are better suited for the often broader-beamed and fatter-calfed belles of Europe than for U.S. women . The committee uncovered guaranteed nonrun hose with hole-spawning flaws and " seconds " passed off as " perfects . " Like Mrs. Sullivan , Hart has asked the FTC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an attempt to get a leg up on its critics , the industry has been trying to straighten out the mesh for some time . The National Association of Hosiery Manufacturers , which represents most big-name mills , took measurements from 10,000 women in order to determine the most common height-weight combinations . The group aims to get the entire industry to use the data as a basis for standardized sizing . Burlington is sponsoring a national advertising campaign to educate women in the proper way to enter ( sitting down ) and maintain ( wash after each wearing ) the company 's products .
