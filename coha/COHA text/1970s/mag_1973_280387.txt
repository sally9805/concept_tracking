" Jazz is a minority music and always will be . It just is not popular music . " With that said , Promoter George Wein went out last week and did his best to prove himself wrong-by putting on the largest jazz festival ever staged anywhere . <P> Manhattan 's Philharmonic Hall was crammed as Pianist Earl ( " Fatha " ) Hines , Singer Mabel Mercer , Saxophonist Gerry Mulligan and other interpreters jazzed the songs of composers like George Gershwin and Cole Porter . Aboard the good ship Kennedy , freed for the day from its normal duties as a Staten Island ferry for a toot up the Hudson River , traditional-jazz buffs pressed shoulder to shoulder to hear Percy Humphrey 's Preservation Hall Band . At the Roseland Ballroom , young and old couples danced into the wee hours as the bands of Duke Ellington , Count Basie and Woody Herman recreated their hits of the 1930s ( Sophisticated Lady , One O'Clock Jump , Woodchopper 's Ball , to name three ) . <P> It was the 20th Newport Jazz Festival , transplanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went on for ten days , with 1,000 middle-of-the-road , derriere-and avant-garde musicians presenting 57 concerts ( many simultaneously ) in 13 locations-from Carnegie Hall to the Apollo Theater in Harlem to Shea Stadium in Flushing . It cost $1,000,000 , drew a total audience of some 120,000 and just broke about even with foundation and industry subsidies . <P> Circus Barker . Wein ( pronounced Ween ) presided over it all with the bold acumen of a Hurok and the bustle manner of a circus barker . At his headquarters on Manhattan 's West Side , he could be found conducting two interviews at once ( one by phone ) and fighting off others ( " I have more important things than seeing the French TV , all right ? " ) . He alternately praised his black wife Joyce ( " After I break a few heads , she puts them together " ) and exploded at her ( " Do n't bother me with things you can take care of ! " ) . Regularly Wein would fly out to mount as many rostrums as he could get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acts in a light but piercing nasal voice : " Ladies and gentlemen , I think you 're going to hear something you 've never heard before . " One thing most of them had never heard before was Wein himself playing a pleasant , Teddy Wilson-like jazz piano , which he did with the Newport Ensemble on the rainy opening day in Central Park . <P> Wein 's lifelong passion for jazz began because of , rather than in spite of , his parents , a Boston plastic surgeon and his wife who collected records by Louis Armstrong , Duke Ellington and other jazz pioneers . When George branched out from his classical piano studies to what he calls " party piano , " his parents encouraged him . At 15 he was playing jazz in clubs like the Tic Toe in Boston and the Blue Moon in Lynn , and his parents were driving him to and from the gigs . After working as a $60-a-week sideman with Clarinetist Pee Wee Russell , Wein opened his own club in Boston 's Copley Square Hotel in 1950 . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it ran successfully for ten years . In 1954 Wein organized the first of 18 annual summer jazz festivals in Newport , R.I.
