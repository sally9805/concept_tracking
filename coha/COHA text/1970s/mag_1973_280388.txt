On narrow creeks and wide rivers , Americans in unprecedented numbers are bobbing about in rubber rafts this summer . Many novices prudently do their paddling on calm waterways . The more daring seek the kind of white-water thrills and risks depicted in the movie Deliverance ( though the protagonists used canoes ) . For these one must go to killers like the Colorado or the New River in West Virginia , which the Indians called the River of Death . Its violent rapids still claim inexperienced challengers almost every year ( 15 drowned in 1971 , three last year ) . A number of guide services have sprung up along the New that provide rafts , equipment and expertise , though paying passengers still take risks and do their own paddling . TIME Correspondent David Wood recently navigated the New on a two-day trip . His report : <P> For $80 you get a yellow life jacket , the use of tents and other gear , and a seat in a 23-ft. raft . You also get a college-age guide who is a white-water veteran . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five rafts are amateurs for the most part . They include a group of young nurses from Michigan , two retired couples , some long-haired young New Yorkers , a plump middle-aged woman from Virginia . All they have in common is a determination to travel the 30 miles between Prince and Fayette Station in the most dangerous possible manner . <P> White-water rapids are rated on a scale of one ( grandmother could survive in her inner tube ) to five ( check your life-insurance policy ) . The New has a number of classic fives disguised by innocuous names : Keeney Brothers , Double Z , Upper Railroad . Only one name hints at reality : Greyhound Bus Stopper . The guide explains what to do before you hit a particular trouble spot : " You have to approach on the left side of the river . Then shoot diagonally across to just behind the big rock and slip past it on the right side . If we do n't paddle hard on the right side , we 'll probably flip over . Got it ? " <P> It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory of the plan vanishes . As the raft speeds toward the tumbling water , you are too busy bracing your feet and straining to hear what the guide is screeching now . Pull right ! Pull right ! Hardhardhard ! There is a temptation to hit the floor , which seems the only safe spot in the swirling madness . But the looming danger-at this moment an " undercut rock " - has its own fascination . Tons of water pour through a narrow funnel , eager to capsize us . Pull left ! Digdigdig ! Ten frantic paddles try to obey , and we pass the rock at a safe four feet . There is time to use the bailing buckets . <P> Around the next bend huge boulders constrict the New 's width from 200 yds. to the size of a suburban driveway . The river accelerates to a frightening pace . The water plunges between razor-sharp rocks , whipped to a froth by backwashes , submerged logs and even a sunken locomotive that derailed into the river years ago . The trick is to veer away from souse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swirl can pull the stern down and pop the bow up , propelling passengers into the drink .
