txt JIMMY CARTER got a lesson in farming Thursday night from America 's foremost cultivator of Democratic votes , as Mayor Daley staged a tumultuous torchlight parade for the presidential candidate from Georgia . A chanting , cheering crowd , composed largely of Daley precinct workers and labor union members , bracketed the route along Michigan Avenue and Ontario Street as Carter 's motorcade made its way from the Hyatt Regency Chicago on East Wacker Drive to Medinah Temple . The crowd , estimated from 60,000 to 300,000 persons , strained for a glimpse of Carter , riding atop an open car and sandwiched between Daley and Sen. Stevenson . A HEAVY PHALANX of police and secret service men made it hard to see , but the familiar toothsome grin of the Democratic candidate was visible in the eerie red cast by thousands of railway flares . Someone joked that Carter 's smile can be seen from the back of his head . Thousands of voices crying in throaty unison " Give us Carter " drowned out the protest of 250 " Right to Life " supporters stationed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abortion . It is unlikely Carter even saw them as he was hustled inside the mosque-like structure for the Democratic State Convention . THE PARADE CONTINUED long after Carter entered the building , playing to empty curbs along Michigan and Ontario . Hundreds of persons sat on roofs of build : ings , clung to billboard supports , and milled in the street outside Medinah as the speeches were piped outside via loudspeaker . Torchlight parades are traditional in Chicago for Democratic presidentipl candidates , but generally are held just before election . Daley broke with the past this year by holding it in September . It gave the mayor 's director of special events , Col. Jack Reilly , a short notice , but the old soldier came through . BY 7 P. M. ALL MANNER of brass bands , old time cars , and floats were lined up along Wacker , ready to step off . Daley 's own 11th ward organization had a firetruck and wranglers on ponies , while Sheriff Richard Elrod rode in an open car with two Playboy bunnies . Each ward organization and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , apparently in a command performance . While the parade moved along fitfully , stopping several times while spectators were cleared from its path , Carter was meeting briefly with Daley in a Hyatt Regency suite . Earlier he had worked a crowd outside the hotel doors . " Yoy ca n't say we do n't have a crowd , " Reilly joked of the frequent interruptions . NO ONE SEEMED to mind in the partisan frivolity of it all . The names of each candidate on the party 's fall ticket got maximum exposure as cars moved by slowly with their names on the sides . One , for Cecil Partee , candidate for attorney general , sported the slogan " For Your Protection , " making Partee sound vaguely like a sanitized drinking glass in a Holiday Inn . At 8:10 a fireworks display tiegon over the river , having the effect not only of alerting the crowd to Carter 's imminent appearance , but sending skyward the fat pigeons which roost in the Michigan ' Avenue underground . It was as if Reilly had released a flight of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view , preceded by two towering trucks crammed with photographed .. THE APPEARANCE ' OF Stevenson with Carter sparked a few questions , as many had expected the ' ex-governor of Georgia to ride with Michael Howlett , the party 's underdog candidate for Illinois governor . ' Howlett was at Medinah Temple and did not participatb in the parade . Few incidents marred the parade . At one point a burly young man seized an elderly man and began wrestling him him to the ground . " He 's got a gun , " he announded , as he tried to rip the old man 's hand from inside a shoulder bag . " No , I aril , " protested the elderly man . The young man forced the man 's hand in the open  --  clutching a black flash attachment of a camera . BUT BY AND LARGE It was . Daley unanimity in its purest form . Even the anti-abortionists had to admit they were upstaged , ' in contrast to their more vocal Carter protests in Scranton and Philadelphia . " There 's no question we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the south suburban " Right to Life . " " They ( police I were walking along In front of us shielding Carter . But we made our point morally anyway . " The abortion foes carried signs reading " In order to be reborn , you have to be born . " One demonstrator stood atop a van in white robes , symbolically washing'his hands . A placard on the van proclaimed Carter " Torlay:s Pontius Pilate . " John , Chicago police department 's chief of patrol , estimated the parade ' crowd . . at 100,000 , while Reilly himself put it at 500,000 . Ald Roman Pucinskl Old put It at a more realistic level , - 100,000 . PUCINSKI EXPLAINED Daley 's strategy of changing the date of the torchlight parade this way : " It impresses the precinct captains that the campaign is on . There are no more ifs , ands , or buts . We 've got 55 more days , What Daley 's doing is triggering off the campaign . ' ; We 've not had At , . Democrat in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants Howlett in as governor . He 's taking no chances . If there 's ore thing that makes Daley great , it 's that he leaves nothing to chance . "
