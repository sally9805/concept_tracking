The Los Angeles Lakers had just won their first National Basketball Association championship , and the proud , patient giant stood sweating in the chaotic locker room-a Gulliver indulging a swarm of Lilliputian newsmen . " For a long time , " he said , " fans of mine had to put up with people saying Wilt could n't win the big ones . Now maybe they 'll have a chance to walk in peace , like I do . " <P> For Wilt Chamberlain , vindication was sweet . The most dominating personality and physical presence in professional basketball for the past 13 years , he had been stamped as one of sport 's alltime great losers . As his detractors took delight in pointing out , in critical play-off games Chamberlain seemed unable to produce the same heroics he performed so matter of factly during the regular season . Although he held numerous individual records and honors , he had helped only one team to a national title ( Philadelphia , in 1967 ) . The Big Dipper , the knockers said , choked in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silent-and for good reason . After leading the Lakers to the best won-lost record ( 69-13 ) in N.B.A. history during the regular season , Chamberlain was nothing short of awesome in the playoffs . In the N.B.A. 's western division title series with Milwaukee , he decisively outplayed basketball 's newest giant superstar , Kareem Abdul-Jabbar , eleven years his junior . Then , after shuffling uncertainly in the first game of the championship series , Wilt recovered spectacularly to lead the Lakers to a 4 games to 1 victory over the New York Knicks . <P> Padded Hands . In the final game against the Knicks Chamberlain 's performance was among the most memorable in play-off history . A doubtful starter because of a wrist fractured in the previous game , he appeared on court wearing football linemen 's pads on both hands . Despite that handicap , Wilt never looked better . With uncanny timing he blocked shots ( ten ) and grabbed rebounds ( 29 ) ; he muscled in to the hoop to sink points ( 24 ) , and his picks and passes set up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Knicks had more than Wilt to put up with . Little Gail Goodrich ( 6 ft. 1 in. ) was a consistently accurate shot and the highest scorer on either team . Jerry West never did shoot with his usual accuracy , but he was the most active playmaker in the series , with 44 assists . Harold ( " Happy " ) Hairston outrebounded everybody but Wilt , and Jim McMillian came through with clutch baskets that devastated the Knicks in the fourth game 's overtime period . <P> The Knicks , for their part , were unable to maintain their accurate shooting ( 55% ) of the first game , and they were severely weakened by the hip injury that hampered their most aggressive player , Dave DeBusschere . But as DeBusschere himself admitted , the Lakers clearly showed that they were the better team , and the Big Dipper was beyond any doubt the best player .
