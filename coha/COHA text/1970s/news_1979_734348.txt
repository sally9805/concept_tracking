txt Both the sponsors and the opponents of legislation to curtail special-interest contributions to Congressional campaigns are looking to a member of the House Democratic leadership as a possible key to whether Congress will act on the issue before the 1980 elections . He is Representative Dan Rostenkowski of Chicago , the chief deputy majority whip , who , breaking with Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr . and the White House , opposed a bill for public financing of House and Senate races in May . The measure was killed in the Administration Committee . Compromise Awaits Action A compromise bill , applying only to House races , awaits action when Congress returns after Labor Day from its August recess . Its authors , Democrats and Republicans , believe the bill offers the last opportunity for the 96th Congress to restrain contributions by corporate , trade and labor groups . Mr. Rostenkowski said in a telephone interview that he had not decided whether to support or oppose the bill but that he had serious reservations about it . Apart from the fate of this bill , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign financing is indicative of some underlying changes in Congress . He is one of the few members left who have strong ties to a local party organization . In his district the Congressman is a ward leader . A member of the House since 1959 , Mr. Rostenkowski 's strength and security in national politics once // rested almost exclusively with the organization of the late Mayor Richard J. Daley . But even in Chicago , Mr. Rostenkowski says , the power of the party is waning . His blue-collar district ? which stretches from the crumbling tenements of the Near North Side to the rows of clean yellow-brick houses on the western border of the city ? has undergone basic changes . His chief support is still in the Polish neighborhoods , but along Cicero Avenue , for example , Puerto Rican and other cultures are clashing with older neighborhood values rooted in Eastern Europe . Working-class urban people who first voted him into Congress have been replaced , Mr. Rostenkowski says , by the rural poor from various regions and nations.Some neighborhood organizations , struggling to make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dependence on National Interests As a result of these changes , Mr. Rostenkowski has become ' more dependent on support from national interests . Although he has never been threatened in an election , and he won by a margin of 85 percent in 1978 , he collected $185,000 in campaign funds that year . Of this , according to the Federal Election Commission , $110,000 came from political action committees that the various interests have set up to bring their influence to bear in Washington . Only seven other House candidates drew more from the committees . Of the committee money , $17,000 was contributed by organized labor , which has long given Mr. Rostenkowski strong support . But $50,000 came from trade associations and $39,000 from corporations , groups that usually have interests divergent from those of labor . The surge of prosperity for Mr. Rostenkowski is not unusual ; the political action committees have spread funds among Democrats , Republicans , veteran members and newcomers . Against this backdrop , the compromise legislation has created a seething controversy even though Congress is in recess . Representative Tom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill , said he had heard that the National Association of Manufacturers had started a national campaign against it in behalf of its members . A spokesman for the association confirmed this , saying that the legislation had stirred deep concern in the business community . The compromise bill , which has now been signed by about 130 House members , would do the following things : cut in half , from $10,000 to $5,000 , the amount political action committees could contribute to a candidate in both the primary and general elections ; put a $50,000 limit on the amount a candidate could receive from the committees , and prohibit the committees , consultants and direct-mail experts from extending more than $1,000 credit to candidates for more than 30 days . Opposition by the manufacturers ant others is based in part on the belief tha the bill would give the advantage to or ganized labor , which would still be free to use its members to campaign for candi dates , and it would be a foot in the door for public financing . The rise of the corn mittees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by groups that had never been active before . Mr. Railsback , a conservative , Davit R. Obey of Wisconsin , the chief Demo cratic sponsor of the bill , and others ck not accept that view . Common Cause , th ( public-affairs lobby , and other organiza tions backing the legislation say that the influence of the committees is changing the character of Congress by makini members more responsive to the specia interests than to their constituents of the national party leadership . Since 1974 , when the election laws wen amended to encourage contributions by committees set up by various interests their numbers have grown to about 2,000 In the 1978 elections , the committees con tributed more than $35 million to Federa candidates , compared with $22.6 millior in 1976 . The largest growth has been ir corporate committees . The legislation now under considera ? tion is the culmination of a five-year ef ? fort to revise the system . In the past , the special interests concentrated on contri ? butions to Presidential candidates , but ir 1976 Presidential elections were placed under public financing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Senate races have failed . Resistance had traditionally come from members from safe districts , South . erners and urban Democrats in the North who felt the availability of public money would encourage strong opposition , and from Republicans who felt it would en ? trench the Democratic hold on the Con. gress . But Speaker O'Neill and a number of others in safe seats changed their minds and got behind public financing . Influence Grows in House Mr. Rostenkowski was one of those who did not . Outside of Chicago and Washington he is not well known , but in the House his influence has grown rather than diminished since the death of Mayor Daley . In addition to the leadership post , to which he was appointed by Mr. O'Neill , he is second in seniority among Democrats in the Ways and Means Committee only to Al Ullman of Oregon , the chairman . Although he is not a member of the Administration Committee , proponents of public financing say his influence was crucial to the 18-to-7 vote against the bill on May 24 . In response to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that public financing of more than 900 Congressional elections would create a new , unmanageable bureaucracy in Washington because of auditing requirements . On the compromise bill , he said one of his reservations was that the political action committees , if restricted further on giving , would find ways to set up subcommittees and continue the same level of contributions .
