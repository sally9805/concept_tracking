What is the basic cause of the environmental crisis ? The population explosion ? Or modern technology ? Most scientists are inclined to attribute ecological problems to a combination of the two . But in his provocative new book , The Closing Circle ( Knopf ; $6.95 ) , Environmental Pioneer Barry Commoner places the blame squarely on technology . <P> Commoner , a biologist at Washington University in St. Louis , bases his thesis on the fact that " most pollution problems made their first appearance , or became very much worse , in the years following World War II . " After 1946 , he notes , the U.S. population rose by 42% , pollution by as much as 2,000% . Thus , he concludes , to advocate birth control as the solution to the U.S. 's environmental problem " is equivalent to attempting to save a leaking ship by lightening the load . One is constrained to ask if there is n't something radically wrong with the ship . " <P> As Commoner sees it , the deterioration of the environment is caused largely by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , synthetic fibers have displaced cotton and wool ; aluminum , plastic and concrete have captured markets once held by lumber and steel ; nitrogen fertilizers have replaced natural manure . <P> The trouble , Commoner says , is that these products also put harsh new stresses on the environment . For one thing , their manufacture demands huge inputs of energy ; the production of that energy causes pollution by itself . For another , when the new materials are discarded , they become litter that nature is unable to decompose . Moreover , many postwar products actually generate more pollution than their predecessors . Detroit 's high-powered cars are far more polluting than prewar models . Even worse , pollutants can be synergistic . " If the levels of sulfur dioxide and a carcinogen cancer producing substance in polluted air are both doubled , " Commoner explains , " the resulting hazard is much more than doubled , because sulfur dioxide inhibits the lung 's self-protective mechanism and makes it more susceptible to the carcinogen . " <P> Dangerous World . What all this proves to Commoner is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with whether their product will work and whether it will sell . The result is a dangerous new world . <P> Commoner does not oppose all technology . Indeed , he recognizes the need to develop nonpolluting systems of land transportation , for example , and ways of returning garbage directly to the soil . But he urges a return wherever possible to products that are kind to the environment , and suggests the use of natural rubber instead of synthetic material , and soap instead of detergents . That approach would mean the closing down of huge industries and would be immensely costly-at least $600 billion in the U.S. alone , Commoner estimates , or more likely $40 billion annually for 25 years .
