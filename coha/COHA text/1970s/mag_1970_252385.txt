Sketches to illustrate news have been part of U.S. journalism at least since the Civil War , when small armies of artists invaded the battlefields on behalf of Frank Leslie 's Illustrated Newspaper and Harper 's Weekly . The development of the camera did not end the practice , one thing , artists still can go some places that photographers cannot-notably , inside most courtrooms . <P> A succession of sensational trials lately has made the work of the cortroom artists more evident than ever . For magazines , newspapers and television , they have limned the likenesses of Jack Ruby , Clay Shaw , Sirhan Sirhan and James Earl Ray . In recent weeks , they have been busy covering the Chicago Seven trial , the Black Panther conspiracy hearing in New York and the Lieut . William Calley hearings in Georgia . <P> Many sketchers are freelance artists who work for between $100 and $500 a day . The pressure is severe , especially when they try to capture fast-moving uproar . Says Leo Hershfield : " I love the work , but if I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ulcer . " <P> Looking Better . Some of the art-istsfrave been around a long time . Hershfield , 66 , covered the Joe McCarthy censure hearings in the mid-1950s . But Andy Austin , a pretty mother who graduated from Vassar in 1957 , got her first news assignment at the Chicago Seven trial . She started out sketching it for herself and landed a job with ABC when another artist left to cover a Mary Jo Kopechne hearing . <P> More than a dozen artists worked on the Chicago trial . " For a noncapital case , " says Howard Brodie , a noted freelancer used by CBS , " it was about as exciting as any trial can be in terms of action , drama and color . " <P> The participants posed some problems . Defendant Abbie Hoffman was particularly difficult to draw because of his changeable facial expressions . Defendant Jerry Rubin complained to Artist-Reporter Franklin McMahon that he was made to look menacing while Assistant Prosecutor Dick Schultz came out " cherubic . " Judge Hoffman had a word with Marcia Danits , an artist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me his wife did n't like me because I did n't draw him pretty enough . I felt sorry for him , so I did one in his chambers , and he came out looking much better . " <P> At least Judge Hoffman allowed the artists to draw in court . At some trials , and in the U.S. Senate gallery , sketchers must keep their pens , pencils or crayons in their pockets and draw later from memory . Brodie once got into trouble with a judge who claimed he was being distracted by the glare of Brodie 's bald head bobbing up and down over his pad . <P> Photography is banned in all federal and most state courts , but as always , the artist has one advantage over the camera : subjectivity . Watching Anthony Accurso do some impressionistic sketches at the Panther hearing in New York , ABC Reporter Greg Jackson became convinced that drawings are more than a substitute for photographers . " Drawings are frequently more effective , " he said . " The artist can leave out irrelevant material-and the essence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
