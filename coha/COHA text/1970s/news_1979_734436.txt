txt Congress now has before it a sweeping proposal for tax reform that would affect every American who purchases goods and services . Rep. Al Ullman ( D ) of Oregon , chairman of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee , wants to shift the overall tax burden in a major way from income to consumption . This he would do by lowering both income and social-security taxes and introducing a 10 percent value-added tax ( VAT ) on most goods and services sold in the United States . Sen. Russell B. Long ( D ) of Louisiana , chairman of the Senate Finance Committee ? a " strong proponent " of VAT , said an aide ? plans to introduce similar legislation in the upper chamber . Besides the advocacy of these two key leaders , growing awareness in Congress that structural reform of the US economy requires greater emphasis on savings , investment , and capital formation enhances VAT 's prospects on Capitol Hill . W. Michael Blumenthal , when Treasury secretary under President Carter , stressed the need for such emphasis and told reporters that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " This seems to be the way most governments tax , " said Mr. Blumenthal . The nine Common Market nations and the Scandinavian countries , among others , employ a value added tax . Often called a national sales tax , VAT is levied on each stage of manufacture . or processing through which goods and services pass , ending up as a " hidden " part of the retail price paid by consumers . // From page 1 VAT : Will it make you more thrifty ? No one expects VAT to pass this year . But the Ullman bill , said a congressional source , reflects the Oregon Democrat 's conviction that " we have gone as far as we can go " in stimulating demand , or consumption , through tax policy . At the very least , the source said , Mr. Ullman wants to " open up the curtain iof discussion on the federal tax system and how it . affects the economy . " Americans , if VAT eventually becomes law , would be taxed more on what they spend and less on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could come out ahead by cutting back on what they buy and saving more of their less heavily taxed income , especially since Mr. Ullman also would defer taxes on savings . This might be called , said one source , " rewarding the prudent and punishing the profligate . " But there are problems with VAT , serious enough to cause one senior Carter administration official to term it a " terrible idea , " at least at this time . By adding a 10 percent tax to the price tag of most goods , the official said , VAT would " throw a major upward kick on inflation , " at a time when prices already are rising at a 13 percent annual rate . Also , the official said , VAT would " reward some sectors of the economy and punish others , for no particular economic reason . " Because basic necessities either would be exempted from VAT or would be taxed at only 5 percent under Mr. Ullman 's plan , the administration official said , " you are left with a very high tax rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause major dislocations , in the official 's view , as consumers adjusted their buying patterns to avoid as much tax as possible . Mr. Ullman concedes that VAT would give a one-time push to inflation . But he contends that the overall benefits of taxing consumption and encouraging savings and investment outweigh this defect . Also , he says , reducing the social-security taxes which employers , like employees , must pay , would lower labor costs and be deflationary . Another problem is fairness , since rich and poor alike would pay the same value added tax on goods and services . Critics label VAT " regressive , " whereas the income tax ? rising as income goes up ? is called " progressive . " There would , in other words , be a shift of the overall tax burden from the upper end of the income scale toward the lower end , which the Ullman bill would try to minimize by exempting basics from the tax . Farm , products , commercial fishing , public education , mass transit , charities , interest charges , and exports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ housing , and medical care would be taxed at 5 percent , half the rate on other goods and services . Because imports would be taxed ? raising their cost to consumers ? and the tax on exports would be rebated , the US trade balance should improve .
