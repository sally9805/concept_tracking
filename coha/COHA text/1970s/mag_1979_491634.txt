T his far west of Boston , in the foothills of the Berkshire Mountains , even amidst the flaming reds , russets , and yellows of early autumn foliage , no true native is ever surprised to look up and discover the high peaks shrouded in sudden snow , ice-laden branches at timber line flashing in the morning sun . Such a moment welcomes this pilgrim to Stockbridge , Massachusetts , come to savor the spirit of Norman Rockwell in the place his canvases have sprung to life from the people and the very place itself . The start is at the South Street bridge over the Housatonic River , just a stream here on the journey south from its source in the Berkshire Hills to its broad mouth at Long Island Sound , sending fresh waters at last into the salty Atlantic . The water is a moving pattern of multicolored leaves . As they pass under the bridge , a brisk flurry of cold air brushes the trees bending on the banks , and a slow kaleidoscope of color zigzags down from the Rockwell home by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inevitability . Time is part of this place . Norman Rockwell 's house once belonged to Aaron Burr . " It was originally located on Main Street . In those days it was quite common to move houses . This is what they call a foursquare house , " Rockwell said of the house that originally had four rooms of equal size on the main floor . " Each of the four rooms downstairs and each of the bedrooms upstairs has a fireplace . " Everyone who comes to Stockbridge for the first time wants to see the Rockwell place . That is not too difficult , although a picket fence and a high hedge of balsam screen the front porch from the road . Tourists being what they are , the Rockwells ( who had no mailbox or other identification on the exterior ) still often suffered strange surprises , such as the admiring fan who climbed through the bedroom window for an autograph . Rumor has it that on the south end of the garden , which for years has been Molly Rockwell 's fragrant and flowering domain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian attacks , with a deep room scooped out of the earth below where the women and children might hide while the men blazed away at the enemy through chinks in the heavy timbers . More modern history makes one equally thoughtful . The Rockwell home , in our terms today , is a small " estate " in a town of surpassing charm . The distinction its famous owner has lent it will far outlive the already forgotten luster of an Aaron Burr : The Rockwell association with the property has already brought up the suggestion that in the proper time it be preserved as a permanent memorial and Mecca open to legions of his admiring pilgrims . In that sense , the place is already priceless . But any contemporary realtor would tell you that if John Doe were the resident instead of a world figure , the place might presently be worth a few hundred thousand dollars and possibly quite a bit more . Weep , friends , weep bitter tears over the fangs and pangs of inflation . The Rock-wells bought the place in 1957 for $20,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stands the lordly Red Lion Inn , built originally in 1773 by the marvelously named Silas Pepoon as a stop for stagecoaches traveling between Albany , Hartford , and Boston . In continuous use since 1800 , it has had five U.S. Presidents as guests and has been hallowed somewhat more resoundingly by the snores of Nathaniel Hawthorne , William Cullen Bryant , and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow . The Red Lion stands on the corner of South ( the Rockwells ' street ) and Main streets , and from there the little town  --  although running both north and south along the through Route 7 for many blocks of stately and charming homes set back far from the highway under stately elms screening gardens and sheltered nooks out back  --  runs little more than a block , and that mostly on the west side for business and shopping purposes . When the Rockwells first moved to Stockbridge from Arlington , Vermont ( " I had painted everyone there about eight times ! " ) the home-and-studio was on this little Main Street block above the grocery store . Even then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but more to the point , the famous man had enlarged his front window and spent hours peering at them moving along Main Street to incorporate , with extra Rockwellian touches , into his beloved Saturday Evening Post paintings . Rockwell once confessed to finding the postmaster of Stockbridge so nobly suggestive in appearance of a President of the United States that the artist  --  his model found  --  for years struggled in his mind for a scene to encompass the individual . Now , the shoe is on the other foot  --  or more figuratively put , the brush is in the other hand  --  as the people of Stockbridge portray the great artist for those who are willing to look quietly and perhaps are lucky enough to extract a reminiscence . A sense of harsh reality must intrude here . First , Stockbridge is a focus , be it Rockwell lovers , antique hunters , foliage gazers on this zingy autumn day , backpackers , parents tooling back and forth from the many schools and colleges in this corner of New England , or just plain tourists  --  there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this tiny area , which on a winter 's morning might be deserted . One searches for " faces " and " types . " Ah ! Here is a craggy-faced oldster , a merry twinkle in his eye , his horny hands curved to the plow he obviously follows on a small farm at the edge of town . " A polite question about Norman Rockwell , sir ? " " Yes ? " Puzzled . " How long did you know Mr. Rockwell , and do you have a special little story or so about the times you have met him ? " The merry twinkle vanishes . " I am a retired investment broker , sir , from Boston . My wife makes me drive up here every year to look at these damn leaves turn . Seen one , you 've seen ' em all . " The Rockwell researcher beats a hasty retreat . That adorable little girl over there  --  the one with the curly red mop of hair , perky nose , and saucy look  --  surely she is the inspiration for one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in reality the stand-in for the lead in Annie ( a road-show version touring the provinces ) and homesick for the roar and the night life of Broadway ? The researcher flinches . But this is the age of investigative reporting . Press on , and , indeed , the rewards lie there for the searching . Anyone who is familiar with New England realizes that residents who moved into town only in 1957 , like the Rockwells , were rated long as " new people , " although it might be grudgingly admitted that they fitted admirably into local customs . The Rock-wells ' visibility and charm truly helped them over this hurdle . For many years , Norman on his black bicycle and Molly on her blue one were the modest and familiar figures doing their daily four and seven-tenths miles to keep trim over their favorite route , known to the energetic and devoted couple as Cardiac Hill . This gives rise to a fascinating discovery . Norman Rockwell  --  gentle , modest , obliging , thoughtful , self-effacing at all times  --  had Continued on page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more times than you can count , and what 's more , did it knowingly and would n't stop even when the authorities got after him . Chief of Police William J. Obanhein , man-and-boy on the Stockbridge force these 28 years , working his way up from a patrolman 's humble rank , says in quiet resignation and amusement : " Norman Rockwell broke the law every time he rode his bike . There 's a Massachusetts regulation that all bicycles should ride on the right side of the road , with traffic . Mr. Rockwell always rode on the left , against traffic . I spoke to him many times about it . He 'd just nod pleasantly , and keep on riding on the left side . That 's the way he wanted to do it , and that 's the way he did it . " A little show of " character " never hurt anyone in New England . The chief and the artist remained great friends through the decades . Mrs. Milly Pierce , custodian of the fascinating treasures of the Stockbridge Historical Society  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the commodious basement of the town library , right on that same little Main Street block  --  also can testify to the Rockwellian streak of willfulness , which you might also call stubbornness . It explains a lot about the perfectionism of his work . Rockwell once traveled across the U.S. to check a piece of equipment visually for one of his paintings . At another time , illustrator Rockwell , about to paint a small bird , journeyed to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington and to Yale University to check out size , shape , and color of the common thrush , who was the uncommon hero of a book written by Molly . So , when he turned up at the Historical Society to check a fact or two , " he knew what he wanted and insisted on getting it , " according to Mrs. Pierce . Down at the Old Corner House , corner Main and Elm ( last house south on Main except for the schoolhouse ) , is a charming eighteenth century home recently converted to a museum for Rockwell paintings and Stockbridge historical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are hard put to handle the hordes of visitors ( estimated at 70,000 yearly ) engulfing the small frame building today , lining up in the gusty outdoors in long , patient queues to await their turn . A friend of Norman Rockwell for many years , the curator reveals another facet of the artist 's character . He was a ferocious opponent at checkers , unrelenting and pitiless . Mr. Cook says , in a voice reflecting untold defeats : " Rockwell was the world 's best checker player . " Another tale they tell around Stockbridge about the artist and his unrelenting insistence on accuracy in detail concerns the one Post cover ( or for that matter any Rockwell painting we have ever seen ) that included a nude . That was the Post cover depicting a rugged fisherman trudging home from the sea , bearing on his back a huge wooden crate through whose slats we see his remarkable catch  --  a mermaid nude to the waist , and below that the appropriate piscine appurtenances of scales and tail . That was one time Rockwell turned to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a New York model , chastely photographed in private for his representation . But the fish he insisted on shopping for himself , finding one of appropriate girth and scaliness . After painting the cover , Rockwell presented the pollack , but not the mermaid , to Malumphy 's Restaurant in Stockbridge , a favorite haunt of his . " They served fish for two days , " was Rockwell 's dry and droll summation . The June 7 , 1955 , cover of the Post is a sentimental triumph . It shows a young couple applying for a marriage license in an antiquated town clerk 's office in Stockbridge . The girl was Miss Joan Lahart of Stockbridge , the young man was from Brooklyn , New York . The two subsequently actually married each other . Rockwell had discovered them when they applied in real life for the license . 81-yearold Jason C. Braman , Stockbridge merchant , posed as the town clerk waiting for them to fill out the license , his inner eye fixed on visions of long-past loves . Another Stockbridge model was Scott Ingram . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the December 29 , 1956 , issue of the Post , which pictured an astonished youngster barely able to comprehend the enormity of his discovery  --  Santa 's costume in Dad 's bureau drawer . A fascinating side " discovery " about this painting may be observed at close range in the Old Corner House Museum where the original painting hangs . The colors are in vivid oils , and it still carries the same inpact : amusingly , when it came to painting the Santa 's beard clutched in the lad 's hand , Rockwell decided to mix real white hairs among his oils in order to accent the third dimensional quality . They are still there today , a highly modern technique in an old-fashioned representational painting . One of Rockwell 's most sentimental covers is that of April 21 , 1954 , showing a steam shovel operator obliged to demolish a children 's baseball diamond , much to the grief and dismay of the youngsters . The shovel operator was based upon a " Mr. Hall " ( actually a Stockbridge taxi driver ) , a character used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a four-year-old from Stockbridge . Rockwell has revealed that this cover was a composite based upon from 75 to 80 photographs , of which 20 were of " Mr. Hall " alone . " I generally use my neighbors because they look like real models and professional models do n't . " Yes , Stockbridge has looked with kindly eyes for many years on Norman Rockwell . They know that he painted every President of the United States since Warren G. Harding and traveled to Europe and Asia to portray the likes of Tito , Nehru , Golda Meir , Moshe Dayan , and Nasser , as well as numerous ordinary people in Russia ( where , incidentally , some of his renderings were looked upon with disfavor by the authorities as not depicting the noble Russ as heroically and handsomely as proper propaganda might wish ) . They have seen the likes of John Wayne and Walter Brennan come striding out of the West to Stockbridge ( Duke wowed ' em ! ) and sit for their portraits ; even the sometimes Continued on page 136 continued from page 93 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awed by the honor of a Rockwell portrait . But when Stockbridge really " took brush in hand " and painted the Norman Rockwell the people loved so well , it was in his eighty-second year , 1976 . On his birthday , February 3 , 1976 , 85 kids from grades one through eight in the Stockbridge Plain School , escorted by their teachers and principal , trooped over to the house on South Street , presented Rockwell with a huge birthday cake , and sang " Happy Birthday " and " For He 's a Jolly Good Fellow . " Norman , always able to get along with kids because he never lost a certain childlike quality , spoke their language as usual in his thanks . Looking at the decorated cake , proudly presented by Marjorie Strider , Brian Wood , and Scott Jenny , he said he was glad that none shared his middle name , which he was pleased to note was missing from the cake . " That 's just as well , because 1 do n't like the name of Percevel , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come . On May 23 , 10,000 spectators and 2,000 participants gathered on Main Street to witness a 90-minute parade in Rockwell 's honor , showing him this time  --  via 100 parading units and 25 floats  --  the Americana he had so many times portrayed for them and the world . The day was officially declared " Norman Rockwell Day " in town , in committee chairman Charles Piggott 's words , " in appreciation of Norman Rockwell 's contribution to the great American heritage . " I doubt if Norman Rockwell , ever received a more moving tribute . Stockbridge is too small to have its own newspaper . Stockbridgers read the Pittsfield ( Massachusetts ) daily Eagle . One might think a small town parade of only parochial note in the city newspaper . By no means . The intrepid researcher , gener. ously admitted to the precious files of the Eagle , catches in its columns and photos the beat and rhythm of that parade , spreading over both countryside and city . What a day to remember ! Among the marchers and watchers are many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Post covers . But perhaps most spectacular of all is the gigantic float reproducing in infinite detail and magnificent style the most famous Rockwell cover of all , The Doctor and the Doll . Here is the cover of the March 9 , 1929 , Post , framed in huge logs with the bark still on them . Here are the fireplace and its crowded mantel as seen in that famous painting . And now here is no less than Dr. Donald R. Campbell of Stockbridge , seated in his rocking chair , practitioner 's bag at his feet , stethoscope around his neck . Standing tearfully before him is the child who has won a million hearts , the little girl personified here by Beth Anne Bone of nearby Interlaken . Beth hopefully holds out her precious little doll for the doctor 's attention as he gravely and sweetly tests the beat of its heart . The scene takes place in front of the mantel , just as in the painting . Both are situated on an honest-to-goodness oval hooked rug , the genuine article , about ten feet in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here come other Rockwell scenes , recaptured on floats : Homecoming , a serviceman 's return ; another medical scene , a little boy in a doctor 's office for a backside injection ( for which another Stockbridge child originally posed ) ; the touching teacher 's birthday party , staged by the Stockbridge Parents-Teachers Association . The Rockwells were ensconced on a flat-bed truck in front of the Red Lion Inn and took in every second of the parade . When it was all over , the 82-year-old hero of the day sighed and said , " I 'm tired but proud . " Stockbridge still talks about what must be Norman Rockwell 's most generous gesture of all time . He submitted himself as a model to an art class of 18 ladies who reached for the stars in attempting to do him justice with their work . Somewhere in Heaven a halo awaits him for the magnanimity of his comments on their efforts . " I wish I could draw as freely as this . " " A skillful piece of fine drawing . " " Ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one in color . " Now that Rockwell has gone , I think , for a while there will probably be a hush over Stockbridge . In his last months , the people who flocked on its sidewalks and into its stores were treated to a delicious sense of presence . Main Street has made one or two concessions to the scene in other self-consciously stylish resorts . As in so many other New England towns , Stockbridge has a little gem of an abandoned railroad station , just across the bridge from the Rockwell house , with a single line of track shining its way across the valley to a fieldstone station with a high and almost gabled roof . You can almost see the jitneys there , waiting to take the arrivals up the hill to the Red Lion . Stockbridge is n't going to let this little landmark get away . There is a tiny activity center starting up there , a couple of shops and the like , and no doubt a mall will materialize there on the bank of the Housatonic , and perhaps a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little dell this side of Arcady . There is also a real arcade off Main where visitors may stroll and catch an informal bite to eat , and while in this pleasant former alley , bask in the many aspects of Rockwellianaprints , reproductions , and sometimes steeply priced photographs of his work in limited editions , the tag going way up there especially when it is a signed copy . ( One such is for sale in Manchester , Vermont  --  just a print , mind you  --  with his original signature attached , for $12,000 . A man I spoke to was seriously considering purchasing IL ) Somehow , it made it just a little more precious to the visitor and would-be purchaser to know that he was just a few steps away in the little white frame house on South , perhaps watching them as they watched him . The interrelationship was just a wisp of fantasy in the air , perhaps : But it was there just the same . Rockwell himself probably never had an inkling that such a thing was happening . He would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verbally , was the Rockwell way . He spoke most eloquently with his brushes . Norman Rockwell always turned away praise for his painting skills with the phrase : " I 'm just an illustrator . " There are even some who hesitate to place him among the greats in pictorial art . But centuries ago there was another man who bore much criticism during his lifetime for his artistic concepts . He too was an " illustrator . " Michelangelo by name , he painted on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel in St. Peter 's Basilica , showing God in the midst of all His creations . So , if we believe that the America of Norman Rockwell is among those creations , we can truly say that there could scarcely be a higher calling than to " illustrate " this land of ours . Like his neighbors in Stockbridge , generations to come will look at the paintings of this man , as we do here and now , and say in gratitude : " If was nobly done . "        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
