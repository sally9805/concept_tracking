txt OFTEN , WHEN the mood comes on , I find myself thinking about the wonders that have ceased . Sometimes , flying in a jet with my coffee in my lap and the landscape lost beneath the clouds , I 'll remember how It was to ride west on the Superehief , dining graciously off white linen , on brook trout perhaps or squab , while outside the New Alexican mesas became purple phantoms in the setting sun . Or , be in one of those sterile theme parks , like Great America , and it will come to me how much 1 miss Riverview , seamy Riverview , Close-up With Jeff Lyon where the people were es fast as the rides , and where Bugs Bunny would have gotten a beer poured down his front . Streetcars . Big night clubs . Belies // He 's fighting for tradition // tessans . Musical comedy . Horses in Lincoln Park . All of these are pieces of magic which are vanishing , or have recently vanished , from our lives . BUT OF ALL the things we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I think . And that is the convertible car . There are only a few left now , those sporty bombs with the tops that come down . It has been two years since Detroit quit making convertibles , and the ' ones which already were on the road are growing old and wheezy , and soon they will die . Shortly the time will come when no one except the very rich , or collectors of classic cars , will own convertibles . Ah , but what cars , There is really very little which can match the exhilaration of driving with the top down . I do n't know why , but it stands for youth , and sex , and freedom , all in the simple act of taking the lid off your car . The best summer of my youth was spent driving around in a convertible , a plum and white Pontiac , and I 'll bet if you look back to your own fondest memories of being young , somewhere a convertible fit in . There is something in the American psyche that needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in white suits is a substitute for driving a convertible , and so are hot tubs . CLEARLY SOMEONE should bring back the real thing . But there are people who merely talk about such deeds . And then there is Michael Fisher . Fisher is 36 years old . He is a La Salle Street attorney and nephew of a former chief ' judge of the circuit court , but his shoulder-length hair and a fondness for buckskin jackets bespeak an other than buttoned-up soul . Ile is , as a matter of fact , a convertible freak . All of his life , Fisher has been in love with cars , but most specifically , convertibles , ever since his first one , a Close-up 1957 Ford retractable hardtop . " There is something extremely romantic about them , " he said . " The convertible is the epitome of America 's romance with the automobile . " Fisher owns a ' 73 Olds convertible . He has a genius for restoring cars , and it 's still a clean machine , but one day soon it will wear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nowhere to go to get a new one . HE SUBSCRIBES to a conspiracy theory as to the death of convertibles . " Detroit said they were going to stop making them because they were losing money . That makes no sense , " he said . " There was a steady market for convertibles . They were almost an inelastic good . Anytime you know ahead of time exactly what the demand for your product is going to be , you do n't lose money . " I think instead Detroit got a lot of pressure from the safety people who said , ' we 'll give you a tradeoff , like another year oft gas mileage or pollution control , if you stop making convertibles . ' I ca n't prove this , but I think there is a government move to take the romance out of automobiles because if you take that element away , it becomes just a piece of transportation . You can then concentrate on things like energy conservation . " FOR TWO ' YEARS now , Fisher has had a dream . He would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Others around the country have satisfied a small part of the market by cutting the tops off Cadillacs-and Mark V Continentals and fitting convertible tops over them . " But they- all sell for $30,000 or $35,000 , " Fisher said . It was his dream to bring the price down to something the average person  --  well , actually the average convertible freak  --  might afford . And so lie and another car-loving friend have formed a company called Palm Beach Convertible Ltd . Together they have sunk about $30,000 into a prototype of a convertible they 'd like to sell . The car is a sleek red 1970 Mustang V-0 . The top has been sawed off . It will be replaced , not with an electric or hydraulic convertible top , such as we are used to , but with a " lift-off " top that will attach to the car by four wing-nuts . " I found over the years that mechanical tops always have something go wrong , " Fisher said . " This will be better because there are no moving parts and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lift it on and off with no trouble . " . THE TOP , which Fisher is seeking to patent , breaks down into two parts for trunkstorage . It is made of tubular steel , and canvas will be stretched over it . " We could have done it in fiberglass , " Fisher said , " but I think people who like convertibles like the canvas look . I think they enjoy the top up as much as down . " For eight weeks Fisher has immersed himself in the project , having his design rendered by welders and body specialists . Much of the work has been in reinforcing the car to compensato for chassis strength lost by cutting off the top . But in a few days Fisher 's Mustang convertible will roll off his own personal line . And then comes the test : What will people pay for it ? " We 're thinking about selling it for $12,500 . We think there are plenty of convertible lovers who are n't rich but can afford a $12,000 car . " IF THE ORDERS start to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least two cars per week . An g if the orders do n't come in ? " Well , " he said happily as he drove away from the Sauk Village garage where his car is being built , " then 1 ' 11 at least have a new convertible to drive . " Greater love bath no man .
