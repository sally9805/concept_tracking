A gloomy stillness enveloped Ford Motor Co. ' s normally bustling assembly plant in Metuchen , NJ . The plant was closed all last week to reduce a mounting backlog of unsold Pintos and Mercury Bobcats , two of the smallest models Ford produces . At the same time , a bulging inventory of Chevrolet 's sub-compact Vegas prompted General Motors Corp . to eliminate a second shift at its huge superautomated plant in Lordstown , Ohio . <P> The cutbacks underscore a paradoxical development in a confusing model year . Sales of the 1976 cars that went on display in September have raced 37% ahead of a year earlier and are building close to a boom . Volume for calendar 1976 could easily hit 10.25 million cars , making it the third biggest year ever , after 1973 ( 11.35 million cars ) and 1972 ( 10.48 million ) . Production is climbing ; this March it reached 2.5 million cars , nearly a million more than in March 1975 . <P> But the sales are not coming where Detroit 's automakers had expected . For all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1973 Middle East oil embargo , the public is now largely spurning the industry 's tiniest models . Instead , motorists are buying larger , somewhat gas-thirstier compacts and intermediates that offer a bit more leg room , somewhat more trunk space and in some cases even a touch of high style . <P> " It 's a mixed-up market , " says American Motors Corp . President William Luneburg , " and anybody who says he fully understands it is crazy . " A vice president of another auto company reports on a meeting with officials of two major ad agencies : " Six months ago , they told us what to do : advertise gas economy , small size ; advertise American , no-nonsense thrift . And who gets the action ? Chrysler Cordoba and Volare-foreign names , foreign actors on the TV screen , ' Corinthian leather , ' the look of ' elegance . ' I asked the admen ' What the hell is this all about ? ' They could not explain it . " <P> Part of the reason for the shift in taste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gas shortages , become inured to pump prices of more than 50 per gal. , and is willing to spend a bit more for a larger car . In any case , the decline of the subcompacts , which usually carry sticker prices of $2,900 to $3,400 , is striking : from 10% of the market just after the embargo to 7.7% now . While inventories of most other cars are sufficient to supply only 60 days of sales , dealers have a 100-day supply of Ford Pintos and even bigger pile-ups of Chevy Vegas . <P> Far Off the Pacer . Chevrolet 's economical Chevette , introduced with great fanfare last October , is expected to fall well below its sales target of 275,000 to 300,000 units this year . Another disappointment : AMC 's Pacer , which took off briskly when introduced a year ago , posted sales of more than 100,000 in the first ten months or so , then abruptly fell out of favor . To get sales moving again AMC is now throwing in free $425 air conditioners with all Pacer purchases . <P> Small imports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are also feeling the chill of buyer indifference . They now account for no more than 14% of U.S. sales v. almost 18% last year . Among foreign makes , Volkswagen , long the leader in import sales to the American market , has fallen to third , behind Toyota and Datsun.
