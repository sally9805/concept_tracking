U.P.I. reaches for a safety net <P> In the summer of 1907 , Edward Wyllis Scripps , the eccentric Ohio newspaper entrepreneur , strung together a ragtag assortment of reporters , telegraph operators and rewrite men to form the United Press . Though the fledgling wire service had just $500 in working capital , Scripps gave it a difficult mission : take on the mighty Associated Press , a cooperative owned by its client newspapers and established more than half a century earlier . By late summer U P. had miraculously captured 369 U.S. papers as clients , and it looked as if Scripps ' folly might soon overtake A.P . as the nation 's premier wire service . <P> That day never came . Though United Press-which merged with the Hearst chain 's International News Service in 1958 to form United Press International-has gained ground on Associated Press over the years , it has always been No. 2 . Even worse , U.P.I. has lost $17 million in the past 18 years , including $2.5 million last year . ( A.P . is a nonprofit cooperative and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , U.P.I. 's possible demise was a popular taproom topic among journalists . <P> Last week U.P.I. President Roderick Beaton announced a plan to put his wire service back in the black by ripping a page from A.P . ' s ticker : turning U.P.I. into a cooperative of sorts . U.P.I. has invited more than 100 of its largest newspaper and broadcasting clients to become limited partners in the wire service . Under the scheme , Scripps and Hearst would retain 10% of the new company and stay on as managing partners . The remaining 90% would be sold in 45 shares , and no single client could own more than 10% of the firm . If successful , the restructuring would provide U.P.I. with as much as $4.5 million in new working capital . " The company must be divided , " says Beaton . " We need a stronger base of ownership and a lot of capital . To broaden the base will guarantee the future . " <P> The present seems dismal enough . Though U.P.I. 's 850 reporters clack out almost 8 million words and figures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ubiquity of A.P. , with 1,401 journalists . As a result , when editors are forced to cut back on their wire budgets , many drop U.P.I. in favor of the more comprehensive coverage provided by A.P . Some 1,365 U.S. newspapers belong to A.P. , while 1,115 subscribe to U.P.I. <P> Many editors feel that whatever U.P.I. lacks in size it makes up for in hustle . " U.P.I. has a well-developed No. 2 feeling , and they often try harder , " says Mort Rosenblum , editor of the Paris-based International Herald Tribune and a former A.P . correspondent . U.P.I. reporters have grown accustomed to being slightly overworked and less well paid than their counterparts at A.P . Remembers Dave Oestreicher , 49 , national editor of the New York Daily News and a 15-year U.P.I. veteran : " The company ran a tightwad operation and was proud of it . " For example , in the 1950s at least one U.P.I. bureau supplied its reporters with three-minute egg timers for longdistance calls . By the time the sand in the tiny hourglass ran out , says Oestreicher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'd hang up . "
