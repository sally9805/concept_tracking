COVER STORY <P> Every major U.S. city has its Santa Monica Boulevard . In Chicago , it is called Wells Street . In Minneapolis , it is Hennepin Avenue . San Francisco has its Broadway , and New York City its Times Square . Santa Monica Boulevard is neither the busiest nor the worst . It is only typical . <P> As it knifes through Los Angeles ' West Hollywood residential district , Santa Monica becomes a garish , grubby , milelong gauntlet of sex-book stalls , theaters and 8-mm. peep shows for voyeurs , and massage parlors and sexual encounter centers for those who want direct action . The Boulevard is a flexible ribbon of smut that expands or contracts according to the apathy or indignation of the surrounding stucco-house neighborhoods . It is , in a way , a bit of the Old West , a semilawless , laissez-faire street of chance , a zone of temptation and humiliation , harshly lit by neon signs that crackle their messages : ADULT , ENTER and OVER 18 . Here only stereotypes live : carnival barkers with army-ant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth who strut , pose and eventually curse their embarrassed admirers ; and bemused , disdainful deputy sheriffs who randomly cruise the area in black-and-white AMC Matadors . <P> The profit motive reigns unchecked along Santa Monica Boulevard . The markup on dildos is 600% , and the nudie magazines that retailers buy at $3 each sell for $6 to $8 . Not everything , however , is what it seems . The Institute of Oral Love mainly dispenses talk , and Wild Mary 's Massage provides local stimulation only if the customer pays extra . On the north side of the street is the " Beefcake Zone " where male hustlers loiter outside the homosexual theaters . The south side belongs to the straights , 70% of whom seem to be Japanese tourists . And from the open doors waft odors of cigarette smoke and Lysol . <P> But porn is scarcely confined to such strips . In Houston , the Bellaire News , which is a combination of a newsstand and a smut shop , is taking applications for the job of topless chauffeur who will whisk tourists in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ porno parlor . Ex-Prostitute Xaviera Hollander has sold 9 million copies of her paperbacks . Some 780 American theaters , including many elegant first-run houses , routinely show X-rated movies 52 weeks a year . <P> Playboy and a corps of far crasser imitators , all publicly exploring once private depths of sex and occasionally coming out with cover shots of women masturbating , are at supermarket chains on the racks and on view for millions of customers of all ages . Mason City , Iowa ( pop . 32,000 ) , has five bars featuring all-nude dancers to titillate customers ( see box page 60 ) . Boston lures the licentious-or the curious-to an anything-goes " combat zone , " and other cities are rushing to find out how to emulate the zone , a device to quarantine the porno plague . <P> America is deep into its Age of Porn . The old narrow Puritanism is passing , and few mourn it . But the feeling of relief is mixed with growing unease and doubt : How will the current avalanche of porn change America ? Many who oppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a symptom of decay , of corrosive boredom , of withdrawal from social concern for obsessive personal pleasures . Even those who argue that it is not harmful to the user , and that people ought to be free to do what
