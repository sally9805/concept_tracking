Our progress in " tinkering with life " April 18 is shocking , terrifying , exciting . It 's like watching a baby take its first steps-but then worrying because the stairs are so near . God give us the wisdom-and the courage-to step carefully and avoid the stairs . <P> Carl E. Fratz Mantua , N.J. <P> <P> Among scientists-to-be , DNA research has given rise to dreams unequaled since we first began to explore space . To propose an outright ban on this research is folly . Regulation seems necessary , if only to placate an aroused public , but the guidelines for DNA recombination should arise from within science and not from Government or other third parties . <P> Michael L. Therrien Baltimore <P> The act of living , as opposed to existing , requires the taking of chances - and perhaps a little faith . The worlds that may be opened by genetic research seem well worth a risk . <P> David Fischer University City , Mo . <P> Once the doors to genetic engineering are thrust wide open it will be pursued to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manipulated and controlled by the few . <P> Chuck Huseman Dallas <P> The whole controversy comes down to one question : Who wants to restrict the progress of brilliant men , working in their own fields without destructive or pecuniary motives ? <P> The answer is simple : the same inferior minds that fought the theory of evolution , freedom of the press , free speech and polio vaccines . <P> Kenneth Rudman Newton , Mass . <P> In view of the fact that our so-called human intelligence has already driven some species to extinction , there is only one commandment for us in nature 's bible : Thou shalt not tamper . <P> Jerry A. Shields Dover , Del . <P> The most dangerous organism of them all : man . <P> Rebecca Novak Columbus <P> Perhaps Noah and his friends on the ark were genetic engineers . <P> L. Brown Barn Bay , N.Z. <P> The public can not be asked to swallow , without questioning , the financing of research that has been called both the hope for mankind and a shortcut to doomsday . <P> Recombination research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to allow the public to peer over its shoulder every step of the way . <P> Eric Dunayer Philadelphia <P> Free Trade , Phooey <P> Free trade be damned April 18 ! The first and only obligation of officials in Washington is to the American people ! The Japanese worker is living off the fat of the American land at the expense of the American citizen . Our economy depends on our own workers in our own companies producing goods for one another and the balance of the citizenry . The Japanese would make us a nation of onlookers , not workers . <P> Leo S. Jacobs Oak Park , Mich . <P> As a former manufacturer in a labor-intensive industry ( knitted gloves ) now virtually defunct here , I point out that the greater " efficiency " of foreign makers consists mainly of much cheaper labor rates-as low as one-fifth of American rates . When only a few small industries were hurt , who cared ? Now that the pinch becomes apparent in the bigger ones , Congress is listening . <P> What 's a " fair share " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vonderahe Gloversville , N. Y.
