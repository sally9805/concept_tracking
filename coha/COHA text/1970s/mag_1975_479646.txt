MARY LEE , an alcoholic mother of five , had not seen her husband for a long while : he got going when the going got tough . She was also very poor . Her welfare check was not enough to provide food , shelter , and clothing for her children . Her world was in collapse , and there was little she could do to cope with it . Eventually , all five of Mary Lee 's children were parceled out to various institutions . Only one lived as much as a year with a foster family between time spent in state training " schools . " In that instance , the state paid the foster family more money to lake care of Mary Lee 's child than it had given Mary Lee herself in welfare payments . Separated from both their mother and each other , and frequently moved about , none of the five had much of a chance . Only two ended moderately well ; the others disappeared into mental hospitals , prisons , and prostitution . Throughout this process , Mary Lee 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like old furniture , from one storage place to another . They had nothing to say about where they went or the care they received . They did what they were told to do . -v-v-plieoEpNiEeVEasR incapable aLbAleW pr cr oe ed ing for their own survival and development , and as dependent upon othIra Glasser is executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union . ers , it usually strips those people of virtually all their rights and endows certain " caretakers " with substantial powers over them . Children are the most obvious example of this phenomenon , although women , mental patients , slaves , and American Indians have , also found themselves in similar positions . Such " caretaker " systems have historically been the product of liberal reforms , and their purpose has been entirely benevolent . Ironically , the benevolence and the reform have often led to incarceration without service , and the well-being of these people has usually suffered in direct proportion to the power granted their " caretakers " by the state . Since the state was supposed to he helping and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed to be protected against the state . But during the 1960s , in practically every federal court in the country , representatives of various groups ( blacks , Indians , women , students , migrant workers , prisoners , homosexuals , mental patients , soldiers , welfare recipients ) began asking federal judges to apply the Bill of Rights to them by limiting the powers of those who managed their lives . The latest of these groups is children . Children are perhaps the most helpless of all such special interests . They are , as one commentator has put it , " assigned by birth certificate to their biological parents , " who are given substantial legal powers over them . In the biological family , children have few legal rights and even those they do have ? the right not to be severely beaten , for example ? are very difficult to enforce . And if the biological family breaks down , the law allows the state to step in , sever the biological relationship ( either permanently or temporarily ) , and assign the child to parental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or institutional care . At this point , the child is at the mercy not of his or her parents , but of the government . When the government intervenes , it acts with the virtually unlimited power of a parent . Should that be allowed ? Will a child 's rights against the state be protected if the government is allowed to have parental powers ? Does the Bill of Rights apply to children once the state intervenes ? If so , how does it apply ? When can the state legitimately intervene to reabout $20,000 a year to maintain one child in a state training school . This pays the salaries of his inadequate attendants , and builds the cells and buildings and walls and fences . And many families , like Mary Lee 's , have more than one child removed to such a school . Thus , in any one year of her five children 's " care , " it was probably costing the taxpayers $100,000 to ensure their future careers as further burdens on the state and society . Think of what that money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? private-school tuitions , special tutors , psychiatric help , everything a family with money could buy . But the state will not spend such a sum on the poor ; it would rather pay other people to lock them up . T WO OTHER IMPORTANT books in this field deserve mention , though they are of less interest to the general reader than Murphy 's work or the material in the HER volume . The first one wins the prize for the most repelling title of the year : Delinquency in a Birth Cohort . Nevertheless , it is probably , as Prof. Norval Morris of the University of Chicago Law School notes in the foreword , a rare turning point in criminological research . It certainly presents the only hard statistics I have seen about what actually happens to children who pass through the juvenile justice system . It is almost unreadable , unless you find ta , bles , charts , and statistics entrancing , but it will reward those who brave its numerical terrors . The research for this study was based on the " cohort " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the ages of ten and eighteen . There were about 10,000 such boys , and they were traced through school records , selective service lists , and police records . ( I wonder how Wolfgang , Figlio , and Sellin obtained such records , which should have been confidential . Do n't children have a right to privacy , even against well-intentioned researchers ? 1 Thirty-five percent of the boys had a police record at some time , and these were divided into groups of single offenders , multiple offenders , chronic offenders , and then again into socioeconomic and racial groups . Among the sadly predictable findings : blacks are treated more harsh120 /y than whites , are more likely to be formally arrested , less likely to have their cases informally settled , and more likely to receive a court penalty such as probation or incarceration . After examining all the variables that might legitimately account for this racial disparity , the authors conclude that the different treatment is based primarily on race , not on other factors such as recidivism or the seriousness of the crime . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time fine , or probation ) a youngster receives , the more likely he is to commit more serious crimes with greater rapidity than those who are less constrained by the judicial and correctional systems . " We must conclude , " say the authors . " that the juvenile justice system , at its best , has no effect on the subsequent behavior of adolescent boys and , at its worst , has a deleterious effect on future behavior . " Thus , not only are the incarcerative institutions a waste of money , but they seem to do little more than create a class of future criminals . A NOTHER BOOK , Beyond the Best Interests of the Child , is an attempt to cut the Gordian knot that has strangled the entire profession of children 's services . Joseph Goldstein , professor of law at Yale : Anna Freud , the famous child psychiatrist : and Albert J. Solnit , Director of Yale 's Child Study Center , explore the basic standard ? the best interests of the child ? that governs the juvenile justice system in America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primary , overriding value on the need of every child for " unbroken continuity of affectionate and stimulating relationships with an adult . " They thus strongly oppose current adoption procedures , which may leave the child-parent relationship uncertain for years ; foster care placements , which are too often temporary and result in repeated shifts of the child from one foster family to another ; and divorce proceedings , in which custody decisions remain subject to court modification and therefore leave uncertain the child 's relationship to a parent . The authors propose that each child placement be final and unconditional and that , pending final placement , a child should not be shifted according to each tentative decision . Thus , if they had their way , adoption would he final the moment a child is actually placed ; custody decrees in divorce cases would be final once made and not subject to modification ; noncustodial parents would have no legally enforceable visitation rights ; and adoptive parents would he subsidized ( as foster parents presently are ) in order to encourage a permanent family for the child . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child with parents who are likely to want him , to keep him permanently , and to become his " real " parents in every sense but that of blood . Avoiding discontinuity of the psychological relationship between the child and some adult is the heart of this book 's approach , These proposals are revolutionary . and will , therefore , be controversial . For one thing , they threaten to weaken the sanctity of the ties between biological parents and their offspring , and to endow the state with much more power to sever those ties irrevocably . Some will argue that such proposals , if transformed into law , will allow the state to kidnap the children of the poor and raise them in " better " homes . But of course that is what the state does now , except that the better homes turn out to be state institutions . EI INALLY , WE COME TO two hooks Ilwhose authors are concerned about what they see as the plight of the average child in the average family They both begin with an unarguable proposition : children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very many limits on the power of adults . Children do not have the right to decide when to go to sleep or when to get a haircut or what clothes to wear or which toys to buy because the law allows parents the power to decide for them . More important , children can not decide for themselves whom they want to live with , or who they want their parents to be . Children like women ? have been infantilized , treated like love-toys , made into objects . It was n't always so ; Philippe Aries 's Centuries of Childhood has demonstrated that the contemporary idea of childhood as a separate species is a relatively recent invention . Both the present books ? Birthrights , by Richard Farson and 1 BOOKS Escape from Childhood , by John Holt ? lean heavily on Aries 's book for their philosophical inspiration , and I would suggest that anyone interested read Aries 's book , now thirteen years old , first . It is the fountainhead of all intelligent thought on this issue . After that , I would recommend bait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to read both , and Holt 's is far better and more sophisticated . Moreover , one senses the presence of real children in bolt 's writing instead of just harsh ideology ; there arc soft edges , not hard lines . Both books , however , share a critical defect in their failure to consider adequately the legal and political consequences of establishing a broad array of legal rights for children against their parents . Children would be liberated , to be sure . But the instrument of their liberation would he the state . The legislature would have to pass laws , regulatory agencies would have to administer them , and the courts would have to decide disputes . The state would have the power to inject itself into families and impose its standards . Does anything in history suggest that we should not fear state action in such situations ? Should n't the sorry record of government intervention in the lives of poor children make us determined to avoid it ? Is it not very likely that the state would turn children 's rights to its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents for the state is as likely an outcome as any other contemplated by Holt and ( ' arson . Since there is no way to establish and enforce legal rights of children against parents except through state intervention , we are forced to ask the tough question , which neither Holt nor ( ' ' arson spends much time on : would a system of government power over children be better than a system of parental power ? That may well he the real choice , and it is one I do not contemplate with much hope for increasing anyone 's freedom . On the other hand , Holt 's book may cause parents to reevaluate their own relationship to their children , and that would be entirely to the good . If you allow it to penetrate behind your own parental defenses , you may even find it exhilarating . And if you 're really a revolutionary , you 'll urge your children to read it as well . Then you 'd better duck .               @ @ @ @ @ @
