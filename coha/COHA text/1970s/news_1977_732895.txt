txt President-Elect Jimmy Carter may have used up his " new program " money in the effort to create 800,000 new jobs over the next two years . Mr. Carter 's $30 billion economic stimulus package will have the effect of sharply increasing this year 's federal budget deficit to record proportions ? probably over $70 billion . Since the program extends over two years ? roughly $15 billion for fiscal 1977 , ending Sept. 30 , and about the same amount in fiscal 1978 ? next year 's budget deficit also will be affected . This implies that welfare reform , creation of a national health insurance plan , and other social programs may have to be postponed until a growing U.S. economy can afford them . Mr. Carter and his aides say that new programs must not interfere with the administration 's goal of balancing the federal budget by fiscal 1981 , just four years down the road . One high Ford administration official says it will be " impossible " , for Mr. Carter to balance the 1981 budget , especially in light of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hits the budget in two ways . Tax revenues will be cut through Mr. Carter 's proposed tax rebate and reduction program and , second , federal spending will be increased on the jobs side . // From page 1 *Jobs plan deficit may delay social reforms The entire stimulus package , Carter aides say , may push the unemployment rate , currently 8.1 percent , down less than 1 percentage point ? a clear illustration of how much it will cost the nation to reduce unemployment substantially . Many details of the $30 billion program remain to be worked out by Mr. Carter and his economic advisers . Its main elements and their effects on the economy and individual Americans are as follows : ? A one-time rebate of 1976 taxes , totaling between $7 billion and $11 billion , would benefit primarily Americans with incomes below $15,000 . These rebates , which might come to $100 to $200 for average families , would be quickly spent or banked , Carter planners suggest , thereby pumping fresh life into the economy . ? Lower-income families also would benefit from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flat standard deduction to $2,400 for single taxpayers and $2,800 for couples . This measure would cost the U.S. treasury an estimated $4 billion yearly . President Ford , by contrast , last week asked Congress to reduce individual income taxes by $10 billion , with Americans between the $10,000 and $30,000 income levels getting the chief benefit . Almost certainly the heavily Democratic Congress will act swiftly on Mr. Carter 's proposals and largely ignore those of Mr. Ford . ? Business taxes also would be cut slightly by Mr. Carter , in the hope that corporate leaders would invest more money in job-creating ' plants and equipment . " Mr. Carter , " said Rep. William S. Moorhead ( D ) of Pennsylvania in an interview , " looks to business as the chief agent in stimulating the economy . " ? On the jobs side , Mr. Carter would funnel more money to state and local governments to increase the number of public service jobs by perhaps 200,000 . He also would earmark an additional $4 billion for public works projects ? new buildings , bridges , roads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this money might not be spent if the economy picks up strongly over the next year . ? Because the whole package will balloon the federal deficit , Mr. Carter has asked Burt Lance , incoming budget director , to prune $2 billion from other government spending programs if possible .
