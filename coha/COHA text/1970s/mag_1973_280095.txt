Ever since its founding in 1852 , Antioch College has been a maverick . It was a pioneer in admitting women and blacks , adopting work-study methods of education and including students on policymaking committees . Now that relative calm has returned to most American schools , Antioch is still out of sync . Its main campus in rural Yellow Springs , Ohio , has been shut down for three weeks , and it is so divided by factional strife that many students and teachers question whether the college can survive . Says one disgruntled faculty member : " In the ' 50s , Antioch was considered one of the leading colleges in the country ; now it is an experiment in anarchy . " <P> Mace . Specifically , Antioch 's experiments in educating the poor have led to serious financial and administrative strains that have aroused student militants . They struck the campus for six weeks last winter in support of cafeteria workers who had been laid off . Last week , scholarship students and their sympathizers picketed to extract a promise from trustees not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines to collect trash . As part of their protest , striking students piled it in front of the administration building . Professors could hold classes only in their own homes because militants refused to let them into college buildings . When one teacher tried to get to his office , he was sprayed with Mace . A fire of " suspicious nature " damaged a dean 's office . <P> The 140-member Yellow Springs faculty is so demoralized , some professors say , that perhaps half would quit if teaching jobs were not so scarce . Among their complaints : the administration has been saving money by replacing full professors who retire with low-paid assistant professors ; it is also considering abandoning the tenure system . Some professors believe the quality of the 2,300 students at the Yellow Springs campus has declined . The college once accepted only one out of four applicants . Now that applications have dropped , in part because of its troubled reputation , Antioch takes three out of four . It badly needs tuition , which provides 85% of its income . Last year it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been unable to hire a dean of the college . Last spring the job was offered to Peter Conn , an associate dean at the University of Pennsylvania . He declined after being held captive in the College Inn for several hours by dissident students who preferred another candidate , Black Marxist Economist Kenneth Mills of Yale . <P> At the center of all this controversy , and , some say , partly the cause of it , is President James P. Dixon ( Antioch , ' 39 ; Harvard Medical School , ' 43 ) , who was serving as Philadelphia 's commissioner of health when named to head his alma mater in 1959 . Usually chomping on a half-smoked cigar that sprinkles ashes down his rumpled blue polo shirt , Dixon talks in convoluted jargon that has earned him the nickname " Dim Jixon . " Students still talk about his speech in 1969 comparing the campus to a well-balanced fishbowl populated with guppies , goldfish and piranhas . " For days , " says one senior , " people tried to figure out what he meant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
