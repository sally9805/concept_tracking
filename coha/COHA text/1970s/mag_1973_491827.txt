In a place called America , so goes a jungle rumor , there are places where an animal may study human beings at his lei  --  sure , without the danger of be  --  ing shot , and get free food in the bargain . It goes without saying that animals are con  --  stantly on the lookout for this op port unity  --  preening their manes and horns , striking noble poses against the setting sun . and otherwise attempting to at  --  tract the attention of scouts from these heavenly com  --  pounds . The name of such a com  --  pound , according to this ru  --  mor , is not Eden , but Zoo . And since I am lucky enough to be the director of one of them , in Detroit , Michigan , I get to com  --  municate with hundreds of the winners in these animal com  --  petitions . And I love it . Who could re  --  sist a job where , after waking in the morning , you can simply walk out into the backyard and feed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or break off branches from a bush and let a 750-pound moose browse out of your hand ? And how often before break  --  fast does someone get to rub a lion 's itchy ear or stroke the back of a purring , full grown menace called a Siberian tiger ? For me this is a daily routine , something I eagerly look forward to each morning when the first rays of sunlight peek through my bedroom windows on the grounds of the Detroit Zoological Park . Fm not Dr. Doolittle , although I do find myself talking to the animals as I make my morning rounds . There are times when they seem to respond and actually recognize me . I am probably the luckiest animal buff in the world . As director , I care for the thousands of animals that populate the 122 acres of our grounds  --  provide for their comfort and , as a veterinarian , assist our medical staff in treating their illnesses and helping when new offspring arrive . Except for their deaths . 1 love every minute of it . There is nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along in my golf cart on the twelve miles of walkwaysshaded by beautiful trees , around the simu  --  lated natural habitats that comprise our open exhibit areas , to check on my tenants . Animals are a lot Iike people when it comes to shaking off a night 's slumber and preparing for another day . Take our prized fourteen-member polar bear colony , for in  --  stance . Shortly after sunrise the females are bouncing around and , on hot summer mornings , already plunging into their pool . But not Lynn , the patriarch of our shaggy white giants . While his mates beg for hand  --  outs , or Lynn just raises his head slowly , blinks his eyes at me , and plops back into deep sleep . Usually it 's halfway through the morning before Lynn gets up and starts moving  --  and then only to cuff one of the females for annoying him by being too ac  --  tive . Our wolverines are typical of some peo  --  ple , too . The feisty little creatures are al  --  ways in character , beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  boon troop is so interesting to watch that 1 am sometimes late finishing my rounds . These ani  --  mals live a life closely approxi  --  mating human existence . They have a leader or president , com  --  mittees to direct the general welfare , baby-sitters , trouble  --  makers , pacifists  --  almost all the types who by their actions resemble folks in our society . The boss of the troop is a particular friend of mine . He loves fruit such as bananas , peaches , plums , and nectarines . His special preferences are plums and peaches . The troop is separated from the public by a thirty-foot moat . " Boss , " however , is as adept at catching my offerings as a Joe DiMaggio or an Al Kaline . He could rank among the best in professional baseball 's outfielders . Even a plum thrown a little out of his reach is snared one-handed , with aplomb . As 1 make my early rounds , the birds are making such a racket it is a wonder that Lynn , our drowsy polar bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the birds are tran  --  sient mallards and Canada geese that move in with our exotic feathered population . Each fall migrant ducks and geese stop off at the zoo on their way south , for a meal and to rest . Things are so good for them here that many decide to stay all winter . As a result , our food bill jumps another $100 a week during winter months . This is what a modern zoo is all about . We like to think it is a sort of paradise . The animals live in their own natural en  --  vironments , so that not only can the pub  --  lic view them , but the place also becomes a refuge where endangered species can be protected and breed successfully . A nine  --  year-old girl provided me with the best definition of a zoo recently after a visit with us . The youngster scribbled this mes  --  sage on a piece of cardboard and mailed it to me : " The zoo is kind of like the world was like when God first made it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It applies to many fine zoos in the SO THE SATU RDAY EVENING POST July ' August ' 73 United States where something of God 's handiwork is kept in mind . 1 hesitate to name specific zoos for fear of bringing down on my head the wrath of many of my colleagues . However , I must mention at least five very wonderful zoos . All of us in the zoo business consider the San Diego Zoo and its Wild Animal Park in the San Pasquale Valley as the epitome of zoos and game parks in the world today . San Diego Zoo Director Dr. Charles Schroeder has spent a lifetime in developing the mar  --  velous facilities . The Milwaukee Zoo is a new and mod  --  ern facility where zoo director George Speidel has incorporated many new ideas in the display of a most complete collec  --  tion . Under the direction of Bill Hoff , the St. Louis Zoo demonstrates modern thinking in the exhibition of many rare and beauti  --  ful species . The Bronx Zoo , with its World of Dark ness and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world and provides endless enjoy  --  ment to its many thousands of patrons . Brookfield Zoo in Chicago , under the leadership of its Director Peter Crowcroft , is doing many new and wonderful things to better exhibit a fine collection . I could go on and on mentioning the hundreds of fine progressive zoos in the United States , but neither time nor space allows this luxury . All these zoos offer a precious natural and educational experi  --  ence for us all , particularly for children . But such a community asset is far from easy to maintain . For example , in these times of high labor , feeding , and animal costs it is extremely costly to operate a zoo . The Detroit Zoological Park budget is fast approaching a $3-million annual cost . Smaller installations are costing $500,000 a year . Obtaining animals for exhibits is expen  --  sive . Most zoos attempt to trade or selltheir surplus stock . Many animals are pur  --  chased from animal dealers . The dealers usually have contacts around the world from whom they can obtain wild-caught animals from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I recently purchased a pair of snow leopards which were wild-caught in Russia . 1 obtained them from a dealer for $10,000 . For government-operated zoos , the " Zoological Societies " or " Friends of the Zoo " are almost heaven-sent . These groups of ? " zoo buffs , " ecology-minded folks , and plain animal lovers contribute liberally of their time and money to im  --  prove their zoos and wild animal parks . Our own Detroit Zoological Society , con  --  sisting of 1,600 members , is a boon to our zoo . Their fund-raising drives and mem  --  bership dues provide many things we can  --  not afford to buy out of our government budget . Feeding my animal population requires a certain resourcefulness and imagina  --  tion  --  not to mention $95,000 a year for food , including special diets . Such improved diets have increased the birthrate at the Detroit Zoo by 50 per  --  cent . Prior to the change in diet , our For  --  mosan deer herd rarely showed an in  --  crease , but in 1972 , twelve babies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fat and sassy . The same holds true in our elk , bi  --  son , and reindeer herds . As a matter of fact , all of our hoofed stock are fed a pel  --  letized food . Very little hay and grain is offered to them . Hay still plays a big part in the feeding of our elephants , however . They eat a bale of hay a day each , plus carrots , lettuce , apples , and bananas . And instead of tossing our lions and ti  --  gers a haunch of horsemeat , we give them a specially prepared diet laced with nutri  --  ents . Apparently it appeals to them , be  --  cause after feeding they busily lick their chops , and all appear sleek and happy . Two herbivores , ever seeking the leaf , assume the stance of the two-legged world . The food is stuffed in sausage casings and looks like bologna . Our anteaters do n't get ants but rather a mixture of ground meat , pabulum and milk , honey , and four-minute boiled eggs . Those hungry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a single sitting if you let them . It would be too expen  --  sive . My tenants get " treats " too , like the avocados that we occasionally provide our performing chimps . But we economize on food costs by purchasing through con  --  tracts negotiated each year , which permits us to escape the wildly fluctuating prices that boggle the housewife . There are occasions when we have to dash out and supplement a diet . Like the time a former mayor banned the use of California grapes as part of a national boy  --  cott . Our fruit bats , which thrive on grapes , suddenly began losing their appe  --  tites and one even died . A keeper decided to experiment . He openly flaunted the mayor 's edict by stopping off at a nearby market and buying the forbidden Califor  --  nia grapes . It worked  --  our fruit bats soon were back to good health . The main thrust of zoo keeping today , aside from these essentials of finance and upkeep , is to attempt to house our ani  --  mals and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their natural state and not " jailed . " Moated and open displays have always been a big feature here at our zoo . The image of the old roadside zoo with its forlorn , mangy bobcat confined to a tiny cage always disturbed me . We were fortunate , back when our zoo was being carved out of a swampland for  --  ty-four years ago , to obtain the advice of Karl Hagenbeck , the great German zoo de  --  veloper and animal dealer extraordinaire who originated the moated exhibit . His concept was so revolutionary that it was patented in Berlin in 1896 . When our park opened in 1928 , it was one of the few tearless zoos in the United States . A crew of German construction specialists was brought here to help blend the animals into a panorama of land  --  scaping innovation with simulated rock-work ; when a visitor walking down a path suddenly looks ahead , it appears as though a Siberian tiger is perched on a small knoll , without a bar or chain fence between him and the viewer . Actually , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the public . The people like it and so do the ani  --  mals . Zoos are not supposed to be peni  --  tentiaries for animals , but reservoirs of na  --  ture . Their purpose is not to imprison , but to protect . The concept of wild creatures being to  --  tally free and in a state of constant ecsta  --  sy is as inaccurate as the image of the zoo animal as a defeated , sullen , miserable en  --  tity . In the more modern zoos , the exhibit animal is offered most of what is good in life and is protected from the potentially lethal elements of his " natural " existence . In general , zoo animals are larger , live longer , and breed better than their breth  --  ren in the wild . Any analysis of the intan  --  gible quality called " happiness " must be subjective . A zoo male zebra , for instance , lazily sunning himself while he contem  --  plates his harem , seems more pleasant than the wild zebra that must be alwaysalert , apprehensive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his enemy between quick sips of water . At the Detroit Zoo we have twenty-two endangered species , comprising eighty-five animals , among them the rare snow leop  --  ards we obtained from Russia . Hopefully some day they will have offspring . This exotic animal is fast disappearing in its na  --  tive habitat in the Himalayan Mountains . So it is imperative for us , along with other zoos , to nurture and find survival homes for them . While the endangered species are our primary concern , sometimes even the more common forms of animal life from the barnyard can be quite an attraction . One of my first stops each morning is to check our farmyard to see if our goats , sheep , and geese have added to the popu  --  lation during the night . Babies arrive all the time and they not only help to popu  --  late our zoo but are also a big hit withyoungsters reared in the city , who never get close to a cow or some other creatures common to rural life . I 'm enamored of kids and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and abetted in this desire by the governing body of the zoo , the Detroit Zoological Park Commis  --  sion . Fostering a youngster 's natural love for animals is so important . The kid who loves animals is a kind child . Such chil  --  dren develop into kind and compassionate adults . Certainly kindness and compassion are virtues very badly needed in this trou  --  bled world today . I 've heard that there 's a certain conflict of philosophy between man and animal : man drinks when he 's not thirsty and makes love in all seasons . Maybe it is a sign of contentment , but our animals breed the year round and it is n't unusual to have flocks of youngsters in the exhibit areas . When new births are imminent , I 'm more nervous than a fledgling father . I 'm up late at night making checks to see if they are comfortable , and my wife Vi thinks I 'm a little wacky when I come home giggling Iike a new father because I could hear the squeals of youngsters in our lion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife and I were making the rounds and saw one of our camels giving birth to a fine baby . The event took place in the Austra  --  lian Plains exhibit , and the kangaroos , wallabies , black swans , and emus were not particularly interested in the process . However , the two double-wattled casso  --  waries were circling the laboring mother camel and showing great interest in the appearing baby . I was worried because the cassowary bird is a pretty tough custom  --  er  --  it could possibly peck out the eyes of the new baby . I vaulted the moat wall  --  in itself a tough job for a portly , **34;3457;TOOLONG horse doctor  --  and kept the cassowaries away by tossing handfuls of sand at them . Well , the baby delivered in great shape . Ma camel got to her feet and chased me out of the exhibit , and then returned to clean up her baby . Vi was in a fit of hysterical laughter when I laboriously clambered back over the wall . The cassowaries went about their business of grazing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But while birth is something wonderful , it is saddening when tragedy strikes . I es  --  pecially remember pretty Wilma , a lioness who once was a pet . We had such a rap  --  port going that I could come up and start chatting to her and she 'd respond like a big house cat . She was so lovely , and I remember welt the night she was giving birth to her first cubs . It was terribly stormy that night and I got soaked dashing between my home on the edge of the zoo and the lion house . Wilma was having troubles and a crew of us worked through the night , but one of the cub 's being born ruptured Wilma 's uterus and she died . I 'd been treating ani  --  mals for thirty-five years and I hope it does n't sound maudlin to say I never felt so bad as I did that night . I cried un  --  ashamedly . But there have been some minor mira  --  cles , too , where man was able to assist an ailing animal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lara , was dying and we could n't turn up anything to help nurse her back to health . She had a bacterial infection and just lay in the corner of her cage in the zoo hospital , motionless , refusing to eat . She had lost 100 pounds and contin  --  ued to lose weight dramatically . We called in consulting veterinarians , but nothing seemed to work  --  Lara showed no will to recover . It disturbed me so much that I could n't sleep at night . One evening , rummaging through the re  --  frigerator , I found a can of salmon . On a hunch I took it along with me to the hos  --  pital and offered Lara a taste . She had been refusing every offer of food , but this time she sniffed it . took a tiny explora  --  tory bite , then gobbled up the rest . For the first time in thirty-one days she ate  --  MY salmon . Next day she lapped down several bowls of liquid and ate some liver . From there on out her recovery was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cats on display . The miracle drugs we gave her undoubtedly controlled her infection , but a little extra care and love gave her the will to live . That was n't the only spectacular hap  --  pening at our zoo . We have four female Asian elephants that used to perform here . Since they are getting a little arthrit  --  ic , I decided to cancel the show rather than ask them to perform their head  --  stands and other tricks when they were really hurting . Like people , these ele  --  phants get grumpy at times . One day Mona and Mary got in a hassle , and before they could be separated Mary had bitten Mona 's trunk severely  --  almost severed it about six inches from the end . Now , a severed trunk is disastrous to an elephant . They eat , drink , and explore with their trunks . If we were going to save Mona , we needed help , so a group of surgeons was called in from the Veterinary College at Michigan State University . Mona was tran  --  quilized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a meal . As with Mona and Wilma , I really get to know some of the animals . A young elk my wife had named Harold would come trotting up to me when I whistled for him while making the evening rounds . Maybe it helped that Vi had made friends by bribing him with a few tasty tidbits when she accompanied me on the rounds . Continued on page 100 tarily , but rather what those animals can do for man in working and per  --  forming with him , which is more important than the cold , hard facts of simply raising cattle for slaughter . Today , youngsters get involved in rodeo competition at a very young age . Little Britches and Miniature rodeo competition feature young  --  sters fourteen years of age and under . The annual Little Britches Championship at Littleton , Colora  --  do , last year drew over 1,000 cow  --  boys and cowgirls of this age . High school rodeo , too , has be  --  come a highly organized event with well over twenty different states coming up with finalist teams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rodeo now ineludes 112 schools that enter teams for intercollegiate competition . Collegiate rodeo is where I really cut my teeth in the sport as a barrel-racing contestant . There is nothing like regularly jockeying a well-tuned barrel horse to keep a girl in shape and to help her remain in close con  --  tact with some of the last of the real individualists in this country , the American cowboys . Cowboys may down a beer or two , but narcotics and hard booze are not on their menu , as rodeoing requires top physical and mental conditions . Well , I 've said my piece . Rodeo is an exciting , humanely run sport . It is part of our heritage and it deserves to be preserved . So long , pardner . Anyway , it proved fortunate the day some cruel pranksters somehow wrapped the string of a balloon on Harold 's magnificent rack . The poor animal was in terror when I just hap  --  pened to come along . The situation might have resulted in Harold pan  --  icking , charging into a fence and kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bly , he came to me and let me un  --  wind the string , ending his ordeal . Perhaps animals have more trust in man than he deserves . They certainly do have their own personalities and  --  like Harold  --  they do n't easily forget . One day a star  --  tled visitor walked up to one of our curators and said , " My , even your animals seem to enjoy themselves , " pointing to a trio of our performing chimps sauntering hand-in-hand down a path , dressed in togs , looking over the sights like any visitor . They had sneaked out an open hatch in their quarters . The curator went to retrieve them , as it was nearly cur  --  tain time for the next show . After a scolding , the trio ambled back on their own , ending an exciting but short-lived adventure . Trimming fingernails on chimps is a comparatively easy job , but believe me , you have never lived until you have tried to trim the hooves of an 1,800-pound giraffe . We trimmed the hooves of our male @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three veterinarians and nine animal keepers . The animal had to be tran  --  quilized and when the drug took ef  --  fect , Leo went down like a ton of bricks , but without any injury to his long neck . As this story was being written , Bibi , our seven-year-old black rhi  --  noceros , was giving birth to a baby . It was a breech presentation but ev  --  erything went along in a normal fash  --  ion , and Bibi delivered a fine seven  --  ty-five-pound male . There are 130 black rhinos in zoos today , but this new baby is only the seventh one born in the zoo world since 1969 . Guess I better pass out cigars . I 'd like to spend more time work  --  ing with the animals but I 'm pressed by administrative duties , especially now that for the first time in our his  --  tory we have had to resort to admis  --  sion fees to keep our park operating in the black . We were one of the last zoos in this country to charge an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rocketed to the moon . Keeping the zoo operation , like the animals , healthy is part of a job of zoo director . A zoo administrator has to wear three hats  --  knowing ani  --  mals , being a good administrator , and having a flair for public rela  --  tions . Being diplomatic is the only way to turn down a request from some  --  one to borrow an elephant for a po  --  litical rally , or to pet a baby lion , or handle a deadly cobra . And diploma  --  cy helps when it comes to bartering or acquiring new animal stock . If I may borrow a phrase from Winston // Churchill , my " finest hour " was when American Airlines flew me to Australia to acquire kangaroos and other animals for our growing Aus  --  tralian Plains exhibit . Until then , few if any kangaroos were being ex  --  ported , and then only in cans as pet food or pelts for clothes and shoes . But I guess Aus  --  tra tha thus youngsters who do n't know what they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these vicious pranks . Zoos are the last havens of wild , endangered , and exotic animals . The sanctuary of well-planned and welloperated zoos must be preserved . An expanding human population is slowly destroying the refuges and feeding grounds of many species of animals . If future generations are to enjoy and study animals and con  --  duct animal research projects for the betterment of society in general , zoos must be maintained and im  --  proved . I 'm glad I can contribute a little bit to people 's enjoyment and educa  --  tion , by operating a good zoo , one that never stops growing . 23 I used to work hard . The 18-hour days .
