IN its first two years , the Nixon Administration often approached the problem of lawlessness in American life with a constabulary zeal that moved many critics to warn that the country faced an era of repression . " I am first and foremost a law-enforcement officer , " said Attorney General John Mitchell in 1969 . " Law-and-order " often did seem to take precedence over social reform . The Administration pushed such police tactics as stop-and-frisk , no-knock and preventive detention , and stressed the need to liberate the nation 's cops from the shackles of liberal Supreme Court decisions that protected the rights of criminal defendants . <P> Now both the emphasis and the rhetoric have changed . The language of legal reform has replaced draconian appeals . " By reforming criminal justice in America , " Mitchell said recently , " and attacking the environmental roots of crime , we may dare to look toward an enlightened day when we will need fewer , rather than more prisons , police stations and even courthouses . " <P> Sweeping a Flood . In an address last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Va. , the President elaborated that theme . In restrained tones , Richard Nixon cast the weight of his office behind the gathering campaign to reform and refurbish a vast judicial system that too often is itself an agent of injustice . It was a curious if temporary blurring of the traditional separation of powers-and a measure of the urgency of the problem-that not only Mitchell but also Chief Justice Warren Burger read the President 's speech in advance and made suggestions . <P> Nixon listed the problems of ramshackle judicial machinery : unconscionable delays in criminal cases , overcrowded prisons , court calendars clogged with trivial cases . " All this , " he said , " sends everyone in the system of justice home at night feeling as if they have been trying to brush back a flood with a broom . " Ultimately , Nixon argued , " the goal of changing the process of justice is not to put more people in jail or merely to provide a faster flow of litigation . It is to resolve conflict speedily , but fairly . " In one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declared : " Justice dictates not only that the innocent man go free but that the guilty be punished for his crimes . " Later Mitchell carried the idea a step further , suggesting that there should be a " predictable time " after which a convicted man 's chances for appeal would be exhausted . <P> Some action is beginning to accompany the words . Prison reform , for example , has replaced police training and armament as the Administration 's top priority . The three-year-old Law Enforcement Assistance Administration , which has a promised authorization of $1.5 billion next year and $1.75 billion for 1973 , expects to dispense roughly one-third of the funds to the states for improving jails and prisons . The Justice Department is starting to develop legislative proposals for a nationwide program to treat drug addicts . Earlier , Mitchell 's men had blandly suggested that drug addiction was no concern of theirs .
