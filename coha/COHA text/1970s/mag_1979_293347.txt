Man of the Year ? <P> To the Editors : <P> The Ayatullah Khomeini , with his campaign of terror and death , may have captured Iran ; however , John Paul II , with his mission of peace and compassion , has captured the world . <P> George S. Wilson <P> Fort Wayne , Ind . <P> For TIME 's Man of the Year , I suggest a dual cover featuring Pope John Paul II and Ayatullah Khomeini . They have dramatically represented the forces for good and evil in the world . <P> Richard Virden <P> Washington , D.C. <P> What will you do ? What will you do ? As things stand now , how can you avoid naming the Ayatullah Khomeini Man of the Year ? <P> Jonathan Greenwald <P> Westport , Conn . <P> You 're not going to like this , but Pol Pot should be Man of the Year . There are many indications that it has been that kind of year . I wo n't itemize ; it would only depress us all . <P> William H. Davis <P> Seattle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Britain 's Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher is my proposal . <P> Ilmar Lill <P> Malmo , Sweden <P> I nominate Jane Fonda for Woman of the Year . Her cinematic tours de force Coming Home and The China Syndrome have firmly established her as America 's premier social critic , political activist and actress . <P> Jon Nagy <P> Eastsound , Wash . <P> For People of the Year , I would like to see nominated the Vietnamese boat people , the untouchables of the South China Sea-ignored by the ships , shoved away by the local authorities , forgotten by the world . <P> Nguyen-Thanh-Phuoc <P> Houston <P> Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker . He took away not only the punch bowl but also the hors d'oeuvres . <P> Jim Sheehan <P> Pierson , Iowa <P> Iran 's Terrorism and Blackmail <P> I have criticized many U.S. policies throughout the world , including Puerto Rico , but I 'm against terrorism . Morally , I 'm backing the U.S. 100% against the terrorist assault on the embassy 's personnel in Iran and the blackmail of the U.S. Nov. 26 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positive way . <P> Jos L. Conception <P> Fajardo , P.R . <P> My sympathy goes to the hostages and to the Iranians who will suffer from prejudice here . But the Iranians I pity the most are the ones who will realize too late that there is nothing they can do to get that tyrant Khomeini out of power . <P> Betina Pavri <P> Rockwood , Pa . <P> This is not like Viet Nam . Just let one American shed one drop of blood and I will be the first one to invade Iran with rifle in hand ! <P> Michael Murphy <P> Stratford , N.J. <P> The political booby prize of 1979 should be shared by President Carter and Secretary Vance for giving a visa to the Shah of Iran , in spite of being warned by both the Iranians and some experts in the State Department that such action would greatly upset the present rulers of Iran . The U.S. can not afford to have a President with such poor judgment . <P> Lars C. Bratt <P> Palo Alto , Calif . <P> Enough already about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in comparison with the barbarisms of Khomeini . <P> Daniel M. Kohler <P> Alexandria , Va .
