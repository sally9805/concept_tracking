General Alexander Haig has paid his dues to the United States . Several times . <P> From West Point to Korea , from the Pentagon to Viet Nam , he answered every call to duty . Then Richard Nixon called him one day when Haig , at the time a four-star general and Army vice chief of staff , was visiting Fort Benning . Haldeman and Ehrlichman , about to be thrown out of the White House , wanted Haig to come take charge of the staff . " I really do n't think I 'm the man , " he said . " You do n't want a military man in that job . " <P> The loyalty ethic is strong with Haig . He went . But not blindly . " You wo n't come out alive , " a friend told him . Haig had been through the Cuban missile crisis , made 13 trips to Viet Nam . " I do n't think professional public servants have the luxury to play it safe in time of national crisis , " he said . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had crafted so carefully for himself . Almost by the hour there were new accusations hurled at him-he had got Nixon his pardon , he had subverted the Ford transition with his secrecy and obsession to protect the Nixon record . He was being blamed for more than he had ever done . But he has never admitted just how much he did do . " I may write it some day when I 'm 60 , " he mused ( he is now 49 ) . He saw the destruction of a President at closer range than anyone else . <P> " Nothing on the battlefield was as tough as this , " Haig said . " Nor did I ever see any more human tragedy . " <P> Never in our history has a White House aide been at the vortex of such pressure , been the man to orchestrate so many traumatic events , been torn by so many personal emotions , doubts , loyalties . How could he have continued to believe in Nixon ? It is no simple matter to arrange your sense of duty when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country and the American people , " is all he will say now . " That 's what it was all about . " He deserves to be listened to . <P> - <P> Was he acting President in those last Nixon months ? " I had to do things I would not have done under ordinary circumstances , " he replied . " You can not avoid responsibility . " Was there ever a time that Nixon was irrational , unable to act ? " If there were , I would n't tell anybody , " he said . <P> When he began his last White House tour of duty , he found almost total paralysis in the wake of the Haldeman-Ehrlichman firing . He got the machinery going again . He found that Nixon had no Watergate counsel . Haig recruited Fred Buzhardt from the Pentagon and urged Nixon to lay out all of the Watergate case . When Nixon made his May 22 statement , Haig thought that was the whole story . How could he have continued to believe as one by one Nixon 's defenses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the part that Haig can not explain away . Maybe it was the fighter in him , responding to his commander no matter what . The transcripts show that he helped Nixon continue his deception . <P> Yet , six months before the end , Haig and Kissinger saw an anguished impeachment trial , bare survival for Nixon . And even that was the thinnest of hunches . Did Haig begin to ease the way for a Nixon resignation then ? Probably .
