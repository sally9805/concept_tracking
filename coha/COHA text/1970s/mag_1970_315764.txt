The Communist attack opened suddenly with a fiery burst of 60-and 81-mm. mortar fire that jolted the residents of Thanh My and two nearby hamlets out of their sleep at 1:30 a.m. one night last week . Many of the shells were white-phosphorous ones that set fire to the flimsy huts . <P> The Communists , apparently a mixed force of North Vietnamese sappers and Viet Cong guerrillas , skillfully pinned down one platoon of U.S. Marines and one of the Popular Forces that were on night ambush duty near by . A Regional Forces platoon was trapped inside its compound near the village 's only military target , a bridge across the Ba Ren River . After pounding the three hamlets with some 200 mortar rounds , enemy troops slipped into Thanh My . By then , many of the residents , trying to escape the mortar explosions , had taken refuge in bunkers . They soon became graves . <P> The Communist troops moved through Thanh My hurling various sorts of explosives-grenades , satchel charges and homemade devices called " Chicom grenades , " which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rocks and nails . Explosives dumped into one large bunker killed 24 persons . " When the V.C. came , they shot every house , " says Hoan Than Tick , 56 , a resident who escaped . " When people ran , they shot them too . Then they threw grenades into the bunkers . " <P> <P> All the hamlets were heavily damaged , and Thanh My was virtually destroyed . At least 114 inhabitants died in the raid in the worst Communist massacre since the deathly days of the 1968 Tet attacks . The survivors wandered dazedly through the smoldering ruins of their homes . One old dwarf carried two severed hands wrapped in paper-all that he could find of his twelve-year-old son , who was in one of the bunkers . Even as the people of Thanh My mourned their dead , the women of a village controlled by the Viet Cong only a few miles away showed up to carry off the 16 Communists killed during the attack . Neither group of mourners disturbed the other . <P> Thanh My , located 18 miles south of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1 Corps ' Quang Nam province . The Communists apparently had no objective in mind other than to break that reputation by killing as many of Thanh My 's men , women and children as they could in one night of terror .
