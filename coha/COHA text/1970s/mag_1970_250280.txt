As the first test of the Nixon Doctrine , Cambodia 's struggle for survival is showing mixed results . The doctrine calls on Asian nations to help themselves - and one another-in stemming aggression . Yet Cambodia 's neighbors , with the exception of South Viet Nam , have so far failed to offer a convincing riposte to a Communist challenge that has been intensifying since Prince Norodom Sihanouk was ousted more than four months ago . Their reluctance was all too clear last week , when Sihanouk 's successor , Premier Lon Nol , paid his first visit to Bangkok as Cambodian head of state . After months of pleading for immediate help from a government that is even more anti-Communist than his own , the best that he could get was a vague promise from Thai Premier Thanom Kittika-chorn that some 3,000 Thai troops would be going to Cambodia " around the end of August .

At Pochentong Airport , five or six planes land each day carrying up to five tons of American materiel . Still the U.S. presence in Cambodia is , for the most part , limited and discreet . " We do n't need another client state , " says one U.S. diplomat in Phnom-Penh . " Whether we can pull this effort off , of course , remains to be seen . But we are light-years away from where we began in Viet Nam . " <P> Combat Help . U.S. support has come chiefly in the form of an $8,900,000 military-aid program . More than half has been spent on ammunition and rifles for Cambodia 's ill-equipped army , which at one point was posting guard teams to stand duty without weapons . U.S. funds have also been used to equip six battalions of Khmer Krom mercenaries ( ethnic Cambodians from Viet Nam ) , provide much-needed radio communications , buy 40 military trucks and trailers , and send about 10,000 Cambodian troops to Thailand and South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Ladd , 49 , a former Green Beret colonel who was called out of retirement to oversee arms aid : " It 's a very modest program , primarily for maintaining a defensive capability . " <P> One element of the program not mentioned in Ladd 's inventory is U.S. combat assistance from the air . American pilots have been observed flying spotter planes over Communist positions and directing Cambodian artillery fire by radio . Plane crews that want to fire at enemy targets themselves must radio their home bases in South Viet Nam or Thailand for permission ; it is regularly given . The pilots are not anxious to talk about their role . Recently a reporter visiting a group of Cambodian officers at their headquarters overheard an American pilot 's radio transmissions and asked to talk to the man . " Tell him I 'm here on military business , " snapped the pilot . " And that I 'm unarmed . And what the hell is he doing down there ? " With that , the conversation ended .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
