txt Behind the daring United States raids on North Vietnam , in the vain attempt to rescue American prisoners of war , is a sorry tale of mistreatment , isolation , and humiliation suffered by those held in Communist camps . It is a story , too , of grinding silence . In all six of the known North Vietnamese prisoner-of-war camps , speaking is forbidden and prisoners are isolated from one another . The only sound , besides the occasional dry Hanoi propaganda broadcasts , is the sound of tapping , a tapping on walls , on doors , on steel bars  --  quiet , gentle tapping best known to prisoners . It is the only real human contact the Americans have with each other . When they do have a rare chance to meet face to face , the exchange is always in a quick , urgent whisper . Each says two things to each other : his own name , and the name of someone else . They put . these names into mental storage in the slim hope that they may be released and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Coining Well before the vain rescue effort , the Monitor began a penetrating look at the entire prisoner-of-war issue . What will happen to these men as the war winds down in the south ? Starting Saturday , Nov. 28 : five articles , on the men , their families , the broad implications . Many prisoners have memorized more than a hundred names . The same exchange takes place in the tapped messages ? the trading of names . So far , some 339 prisoners have been seen alive and in prison in North Vietnam . These names have come from various sources . Most of them have been confirmed by the nine prisoners the Communists have released in the past two years . From them , much of the current information has been learned concerning treatment , numbers , and location of the prisoners . There are about 1,500 Americans currently missing in Southeast Asia . Most are pilots . Prisoners are warned that attempts to communicate with one another would result ' either in deep solitary confinement , or execution . One recently released prisoner told of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bamboo but on his stomach , with his feet in wooden stocks , arms tied behind him in ropes . Except for two brief periods a day , he was kept in that position for 29 days . His weight went from 170 pounds to 115 pounds . In other locations , the prisoners were kept in leg irons , in isolated cells . All were treated as criminals and subjected to cruel propaganda . The Geneva Conventions regarding prisoners of war are totally ignored by Hanoi . All of this places great pressure on the White House to seek every avenue toward the release of the prisoners . State Department officials have been exploring every possibility , including some bizarre , offbeat suggestions , similar to the diplomatic ploy used at the time of the Pueblo release . They are designed to save face . The Pentagon 's deep rescue raid received top priority by the White House . But because of this , it may have lessened chances that the men can be released by creative diplomacy .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
