txt Pantsuits are all the rage here these days . But , it seems , they still have their occasional detractors . One day three trousered women were detained when they arrived at the Moscow computing centre , where they work . Comrade Ivanov , a ministry official , took away their identity cards and sent them home to change their clothes . " This is n't a cafe ' or a theater , " he de- clared " One should come to work properly dressed . That is a ministry order " Surprised that such an order existed , the indignant trio , an engineer , a laboratory assistant , and a technician , took objection . " I myself am the order , " replied the official . " If you do n't change your clothes , I 'll send you off and mark you down for absenteeism . " No one can argue , say the three women in recounting this story in a letter to the trade-union newspaper Trud this week , that one should be modestly and comfortably clad . But , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Official power admitted " In our opinion if a pantsuit is becoming to a woman and is not wild or of too flashy a color , there is no crime in wearing it on the job , " they write , " particularly since it is even more comfortable to work in such clothing . " There 's no disputing the official , they lament , since he has the ministry on his side . Tastes differ , but in any event , " good taste can not be inculcated with an administrative bludgeon . " Let the reader be quickly told that such protests are a rarity in the press . In Moscow , certainly , more and more women are sporting fashionable pantsuits , and from all one can gather , they wear them to work . In publishing the complaint , Trud 's editors themselves seem incredulous . " A Ban on Pants ? " they headline the letter . Further reproduction prohibited without permission .
