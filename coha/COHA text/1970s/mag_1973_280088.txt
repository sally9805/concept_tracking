Going into the N.B.A. finals against the New York Knicks , the Los Angeles Lakers figured that their primary goal was to stop Walt Frazier , who led the Knicks through the first two rounds of the play-offs with a sizzling average of 24 points a game . Stop him they did in the first game , holding Frazier to 12 points as they outlasted the New Yorkers 115-112 . But the Knicks have made a religion out of the old locker-room slogan " There is no I in TEAMWORK . " As Knick Captain Willis Reed pointed out : " Any guy might do it for us-the fifth , sixth , seventh or eighth man . " <P> In the next four games , in fact , the Knicks ' top scorers were Forward Bill Bradley , 26 points ; Center Reed , 22 ; Forward Dave DeBusschere , 33 ; and Guard Earl Monroe , 23 . Together they added up to four straight wins and the second N.B.A. title for the Knicks . <P> Said Reed , who was presented with a Most Valuable Player @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the end it was our poise that held us together . " Poise with a punch . The Knicks ' triumph , in fact , has given the game a renewed emphasis that is echoed in the clarion call of the rabid Knick fans : " Dee-fense ! " A relatively small team , the New Yorkers intimidate not by brute force but with a clawing finesse that presses the limits of the rules . Reed handled Laker Center Wilt Chamberlain , for example , with muscular simplicity : he leaned against the giant like a buttress . The result is not dirty or even roughhouse play but what the players like to call a " physical game " - the practice of deftly throwing your weight around to keep your opponent " honest . " As Laker Coach Bill Sharman summed up the series : " Their defense really stopped our running game cold . "
