NEW YORK 'S long-running finan- cial crisis has become so thoroughly accepted a part of daily life in this city that the local CBS television station has set up a Default Desk , to which the anchorman on the nightly news routinely shifts for the latest developments , just as he does to the sports desk and the weather map . Everybody knows that nothing can be done about the weather or about the New York Rangers , Knicks , Jets , and Giants , whose recent performances have only added to the city 's ominous sense of being a disaster area , and most New Yorkers have had a similar feeling of being helpless spectators as the city approached what has promised to be , at best , a form of federal receivership . One curious consequence of the Ford Administration 's view of the city as an irrelevancy is that the bitter public wrestling between Congress and the White House over whether New York is worth saving has turned the problems of the city into almost as much of a constant on the national news as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a report that , along with civil rights , union lettuce , and the public 's right to know , the New York issue  --  the need to pay attention to the special problems of urban areas , starting with those of the nation 's greatest city might be a plank in the Demo-cratic platform at the Party 's Presidential Convention next year , which will be held , of course , in New York , if by then the city is still in shape to receive visitors . Local prospects improved dramatically after the appearance of polls reporting that sixty-nine per cent of the American people favored loan guarantees for the city and that the same percentage thought a default here would damage the national economy ; this news apparently helped persuade the President that a good-riddance policy toward New York might not be the can't-lose political pitch that he had thought it was as the winner of all those congressional races in Grand Rapids . It may not even be surefire any longer in Grand Rapids , where an editorial in the local Press recently criticized his attacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and added , " At a time when conciliation , understanding , and , above all , cooperation will be absolutely essential in solving urban problems , the White House seems to be declaring war on failing cities and the people who live in them . " Since the Ford change of heart represents one of the swiftest Presidential turnabouts within memory , the White House will undoubtedly insist on a number of rhetorical rationalizations to save Presidential face , and until it is clear that all the haggling and posturing on the New York question is finally closed out in Washington and Albany , the local Default Desk will probably remain prudently open , just in case . THERE will also continue to be brisk discussion here of how much the widespread speculation over the plans of the Vice-President following his disaffiliation with Ford 's 1976 ticket had to do with the President 's amended attitude . Supporters of Ford 's view of this city as a town of crazy wastrels , an alien territory whose prospective financial ruin is of little concern to right-thinking Americans everywhere , should not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government changes that were announced by the President on the first Monday of this month  --  halfway between Halloween and Guy Fawkes Day  --  was , as usual , somewhat out of sync with the reaction of most other parts of the country . The effects of the IVashington reshuffle on dkente and on the political futures of various Cabinet-level power brokers were , of course , of some interest here , but by far the largest share of the city 's attention centered on the news about Nelson Rockefeller , the four-time governor of this state whose campaign for the nation 's highest office New Yorkers  --  sometimes the victims , sometimes the beneficiaries of his maneuvers in pursuit of that ambition have been watching at close quarters for nearly a generation . Had the old campaigner really given up ? Since the President was now free to ally himself more firmly with the conservative element of the Republican Party , for whom the irrelevance of a New York disaster in the national picture is clearly an article of faith , would Rockefeller 's move encourage more moderate Republicans to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city ? And what had moved him to cut loose , anyhow ? The true , certified provenance of any important public event often is not settled upon by expert witnesses until long after the fact  --  frequently just in time for the revisionists to start taking it apart . But no matter what explanation the historians eventually agree upon in this case , or how often Rockefeller himself refers to his overriding interest in ending Party squabbles , there arc many local citizens ( New York solipsists to the end , some might say ) who will not doubt that his withdrawal was largely the result of the untenable position in which he found himself as a proclaimed believer in the critical need for federal aid to help New York survive and , at the same time , a candidate for reappointment to membership in an Administratinn that was bent on reaping what it believed to be large political benefits from arranging the city 's funeral . Rockefeller 's removal of his name from consideration came , they .. point ( Wit , just five days after what will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Ford 's drop-dead-New York speech . The White House is not like1y to discourage the theory that Rockefeller pulled out because he was about to be declared expendable , but New York Senator Jacob Javits , who spoke to Rockefeller the night the Vice-President 's cool , carefully correct statement of withdrawal was made public , insisted that the disagreement over whether or not to help the city had been decisive , and another local source identified as " close to the Rockefeller family " told an Associated Press reporter , " Nelson felt that all the things he helped to build here would be in jeopardy because of Ford 's policy toward New York . You can SI2C the monumental impact of New Yen-lc City 's crisis .. when it impaed Nelson give up something he really wanted . " In any event , if Rockefeller should decide to conduct an all-out campaign as a champion of the city the groundwork has been laid . Inevitably , however , quite a few of his fellow-New Yorkers , who over the years have watched his shifts and **25;5047;TOOLONG turns according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would view such a campaign with deep suspeion. it seems likely , would many of his fellow-politicians , including Gerald Ford , Part of New York City 's problem is that it is regarded as such a weird place that a President widely known as a political sweet-talker , It la , would never dream of insulting , for example , Senator James Allen 's state of Alabama or of standing stli while somebody else laid into his own hotre state . of Michigan , seemed to have not a glimmer of understanding that savage attacks on the home city of lds chosen Vice-President rn:ght cause Rockefeller some distress . Although Ford has never &splayed; much sense of history , he probably knows that through the centuries politicians have renounced the chance of high office ( to the profit of their political rivals ) for reasons of principle , for honor , for country , even for love . But for New York City ? THE President 's indifference to the fate of all New Yorkers  --  as it seemed to he expressed in his National Press Glib speech  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philippic , he entertained at least twelve New Yorkers , not including the Vice-Presi dent , who stopped in during the afternoon before flying to Florida , where he was to preside over a forum on the Administration 's domestic policies . ( Ford 's plan to make the address giving full vent to his views on New York City had just been announced , and it was at this meeting that Rockefeller told him of his plan to withdraw from the 1976 ticket . ) One of the afternoon callers from New York was James L. Buckley , the conservative Republican senator , in whose reelection next year the President has an interest ; an example of Democratic mismanagement in New York that Ford presumably has no objection to is the fact that this state , where four Democrats are registered to every three Republicans , is represented in the Senate by two Republicans . At Buckley 's request , he had been allowed to bring with him eleven officers of the city 's unions . Alleged greediness on the part of city employees ' unions as a general category @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political ) powerful leaders have , of course , been blamed by members of the Ford Administration for many of the city 's financial troubles . On this occasion , however , lavish pension benefits after twenty years and similar advertised municipal crimes went unmentioned , perhaps because most of the visitors were leaders of the police , fire , and transit-police unions , whose endorsement of Buckley and public alliance with the catchy slogan of his supporters ( " Is n't it time we had a Senator ? " ) contributed significantly to his thirty-nine-per-cent plurality in 1970 over two liberal opponents . Buckley had not brought with him John De Lury , the head of the Uniformed Sanitationmen 's Association , who generally supports Democratic candidates , and the President , in his speech the following day , did not specify garbage collection as one of the essential public services that must be maintained ; in fact , he specifically attacked , as an example of outrageous New York prodigality , the salaries and fringe benefits of the sanitationmen . During the White House meeting , the President did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McFeeley , the president of the Patrolmen 's Benevolent Association , although the P.B.A. 's " Fear City " pamphlets passed out last summer to warn tourists not to come to New York except at the peril of their lives are considered locally to have had much the same destructive tone and intent as the President 's speech . One reason Senator Buckley asked for the meeting may have been that he badly needed the political boost of a wellpublicized visit to the White House in the company of New Yorkers important to the city 's survival . A few weeks earlier , he had stunned Republican leaders in the state , who are aware of something that Buckley seemed to have forgotten  --  that forty per cent of the state 's votes come from the five bor oughs by announcing that he was against federal guarantees for New York bonds . " New York City has been lording it over the world for decades , " he said . " It 's a little like when the United States is in trouble  --  the rest of the world titters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city the state 's two Republican senators reacted differently . Senator Davits called it " in grave error , " white Senator Buckley described it as " a proper scenario . " The response of another New York Republican , the Vice-President , at the airport on his way back from Florida , was to follow what had often been his practice , and try to play it both ways . The President , he said , had " done the right thing . " Reminded of Ford 's prediction that bankruptcy would cause New Yorkers only " temporary inconveniences , " he said that lie and the President differed on this point . ( " That 's a comforting thought , " he had remarked a few clays earlier , after a similar prophecy . " And most of the people saying that are people who do n't live there . " ) Be then added thoughtfully , " And it just happens that he is President of the United States and I am Vice-President of the United States . " In other quarters , the responses were less polite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes one wonder whether the impeachment was really such a good idea , " and the Post columnist James Wechsler described Ford . as " Nixon 's ultimate dirty trick on his countrymen . " In New York for a Democratic political forum , WTisconsin Representative Henry Reuss , chairman of the House Committee on Banking , Currency , and Housing , which the next day approved a bill that would provide the city with some federal guarantees , said that the speech represented " sadism " and the desire of the Ford Administration to watch the city " twist slowly , slowly in the wind . " The London Times called the Ford program for the city " monumental folly . " The title of the editorial in the London paper , whose style is , of course , different from that of the News , was " Whom the Gods Wish to Destroy . " THEfederal monitors who , accord- ing to the latest plans , will soon he ' keeping an eye on New York , may discover that cutting off the unwholesome city from the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not the simple matter that the President 's recent message suggested  --  as is indicated by some of the events on the local agenda in the days that followed his National Press Club speech . By the day of Ford 's attack on his favorite enemy , the Egyptian President Anwar al-Sadat ( who two days earlier , also choosing that clubhouse as a forum , had attacked his favorite enemy , Zionism , as a symbol of evil in the Middle East ) had moved on to New York to address the United Nations . He was met at the airport by the United States Ambassador to the United Nations , Daniel Patrick Moynihan , who had denounced as an " obscene act " and a means of " legitimating anti-Semitism " the October 17th resolution of a United Nations committee branding Zionism as a form of racism  --  a resolution that Sadat had actively supported . ( Moynihan had also announced that if the resolution should pass the full Assembly as it did last week the United States would he forced to regard the U.N . as " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Administration , the single point in favor of this attitude , if it should indeed become official policy , is that it would diminish the importance of New York , whose alleged irrelevance is hard to maintain while it is , in a sense , the capital of the world . ) After Sadat 's National Press Club attack on Zionism , Mayor Abraham Beanie had cancelled R meeting at which he was scheduled to present Sadat with the key to the city . The timing of the Mayor 's refusal to greet an official visitor to the United States who had been entertained that week at the White House may have been unfortunate , since it confirmed the out-of-town view that the ways of New Yorkers are hopelessly foreign to those of other Americans , just as the President had implied . However , the formal policy of those local Jewish organizations that had brought out two hundred thousand protesters against the head of the Palestine Liberation Organization , Yasir Arafat , on his visit to the city last year was to ignore Sadat , who had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The only hostile forces to greet the Egyptian President when he arrived at the U.N were not those which resented his attacks on Zionism but those which thought he had n't gone far enough : local allies of the P.L.O. , including members of Brooklyn 's Arab community , waving signs that read ' ' SADAT  --  SOLD our TO ISRAEL . " Confused by the red armbands worn by the P.L.O . demonstrators , an elderly spectator attacked some of diem with his fists , shouting " Commies ! " and " Red traitors ! " and similar terms that are still the style here among those who , like former Defense Secretary James Schlesinger , have n't quite adjusted to dftente . The day 's events had also brought raised voices in New York 's black neighborhoods , where the Muslims are an increasingly powerful force , as they are in many black communities around the country . " HARLEMITES UNANIMOUSLY AGAINST BEAME " was a headline on the front page of Harlem 's ilnisterdam News , which had supported Beanie in the 1973 mayoral election but now took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the paper quoted was the Reverend A. Kendall Smith , founder of the Task Force Against Racism , who warned , " Beame would be wise not to offend any of the darker citizens of New York . Blacks respect citizens of the East , the land of our origin . " Standing across from the U.N . on the day of Sadat 's address was a large delegation of blacks waving signs that bade Sadat welcome from " ALL MUSLIMS IN AMERICA " and " THE NATION OF ISLAM , " and from time to time shouting an invitation to him to come to Harlem , where , they promised , he would receive the key to their part of the city . After Gerald Ford 's speech , City Council President Paul O'Dwyer cornmented that the apparent willingness of other Americans to stand by and watch this city go under grew out of their perception of New York as " a black and Jewish town . " What is not always perceived elsewhere , and would he hard for any prospective fed-era/ overseers to adjust to , is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for more than a third of the city 's population , may take opposite sides on almost any question , and that even when they agree there will he similar conflicts among the city 's large numbers of Puerto Ricans , Italians , Greeks , Dominicans , and Haitians , not to mention American Indians . Sometimes the hostilities will stem from declared loyalties to distant countries among which the federal government is having enough trouble trying to help maintain an uneasy peace without having to fight the same battles in the five boroughs . More often , the bitterness will reflect the rivalry for jobs , housing , and other sources of security about which hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers arc bound to feel a growing desperation in the near future . Any outside mediators who might come here as part of it federal rescue effort would find that every decision concerning the parcelling out of available funds and the priority lists for paying off the city 's debts had volatile ethnic and racial implications . It was 110 surprise to many New Yorkers , during the last week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hand in the city 's financial crisis the more receptive it seemed to become to arrangements that would leave the more perilous political judgments to local and state officials . SOMETIMES it seems that many of the nation 's problems might he solved with less pain to various of its citi7ens if there were no jet airplanes , Ind politicians were therefore forced to sit quietly in one place more of the ? ime instead of being able to career out to the airport on the slightest excuse ( including an invitation to speak on energy conservation ) and fly to one end of the country or the other . Immediately after his National Press Club speech , the President flew off first to Los Angeles and then to San Francisco for political fund-raising affairs , at which Ills attacks on New York were a big hit . ( He did not mention that in both cities the police arc better paid than those in spendthrift New York , of that in San Francisco the sanitation-men also make higher salaries . ) On being asked  --  as Ford got ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to visit New York , Press Secretary Ron Nessen said , " With the first wave of paratroopers . " Meanwhile , on the evening of the National Press Club speech , the Vice-President had flown from Florida to New York and by the next morning was at the family compound at Pocantico Hills , in Westchester County , where Sadat joined him for lunch with Secretary of State Kissinger and Rockefeller 's brother David , chairman of the Chase Manhattan Bank , who has been heavily involved in the struggle to save the cit ) and had asked Gerald Ford early in the fall to take measures to prevent its default . At a dinner the night before at the Waldorf-Astoria , Sadat had urged about a thousand of America 's leading financiers and industrialists to invest in his country , which , he pointed out , " is not bankrupt . " ( The next day , Ford sent to Congress a 4.7-billion-dollar foreign-aid hill that included 3.4 billion for the Middle East . ) After Sadat 's visit , the Vice-President , touching another base , flew to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he accepted an honorary doctorate of humane letters from Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion . The following day , he was photographed giving Sadat a hear hug at the airport in Chicago , of which Mayor Richard J. Daley had just made the Egyptian President an honorary citizen . From there , the two men flew to Houston , where Sadat was made an honorary Texas Ranger . ( The mayor of Houston , whose problems are different from Abe Beanie 's , asked the Egyptian President if Texas could apply for membership in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries . ) The Vice-President then flew back to Pocantico Hills and spent an entire day in that one place . Late the following day  --  this was Sunday , November 2nd  --  he phoned the President in Jacksonville , Florida , to which Ford had flown , on a fifteen-hundred-mile round trip , for lunch and dinner and a swim , so that he and Sadat could discuss whether Egypt should be provided with nuclear capability . ( It was that morning , between 8 and 9 A.M. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the President had called in Secretary of Defense Schlesinger and C.I.A . Director William E. Colby and told them that they were fired . ) Shortly before the call from Rockefeller , there had been a big laugh in the President 's entourage when Jacksonville high-school hand played a medley for the President that included " Give My Regards to Broadway . " Rockefeller and Ford discussed the timing of his withdrawal , and the following morning the Vice-President flew down to Washington and delivered his letter by hand . In contrast to all this high-level tourism , most of the members of the informal New York consortium of bankers , blisincssmen , labor-union leaders , and city and state officials who have been working together for many months to try to keep the city out of the bankruptcy that the President had prescribed for it have been staying pretty much in one place , or , at any rate , in one city , except for occasional trips to Washington to testify on the critical nature of the New York situation . As complex financial schemes that seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rohatyn , the chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation , which the state set up in June to sell bonds for the city , had no apologies , explaining that he was willing to try anything . " If the Sheikh of Kuwait were to walk by the city trailing an aroma of dollars , I would chase after him , " said Rohatyn , who is the grandson of a grand rabbi of Poland . Now that the White House has apparently concluded that the political advantage lies in rescuing New York rather than pushing it under , it seems that the city will not have to look for help from some other nation 's foreign-aid program . The terms Washington imposes will undoubtedly he hard for New Yorkers to live with , but , as Rnhatyn put it to some recalcitrant hical officials , the prospective ordeal will be " like growing old  --  you might not like it , but it 's better than the alternative . " As for the Vice President , it seems likely that , wearing the familiar grin , he will be dodging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President on New York or any other subject . An open break , after all , might require a man of principle to leave the Ford Administration entirely , and thus deprive Rockefeller of any chance of reaching his longtime goal by the most direct route . As he recently said of the Presidency , " I have to say I am closer to it right now than I have ever been . " After the Vice-President 's withdrawal from the 1976 ticket , Senator Buckley 's columnist brother William pointed out that if a New York default should result in anything Like the national catastrophe Rockefeller had warned it might bring , he could emerge as " something of an urban champion , as distinguished from merely a parochial champion elf the interests of New York City and his brother David . " If hard times in other urban areas should now be blamed on the slowness of the White House to act on New York 's problems , the consequence might be similar . The question , of course , is how ? ( ir whether  --  Rockefeller would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If there should be a rising up among liberal Republicans ( " Is n't it time we had a Presidential candidate ? " ) , he can not even count on being the man they would turn to . Just in case , however , five days after his formal withdrawal the New York State Republican county chairmen in effect rescinded their previous endorsement of Gerald Ford for the Presidency and agreed to send a " united and uncommitted " delegation to the 1976 Convention , in Kansas City . All that now seerrs reasonably certain is that New York 's perennial Presidential candidate has n't given up that , as he said last week , " nobody knows what might happen . " He still has some hope that with luck , the changing elf a number of minds , and the availability , one way or another , of quite a hit of money , he has perhaps a chance . Which is about the way things have been with the city .                 @ @ @ @
