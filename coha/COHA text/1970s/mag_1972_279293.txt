Middle America is supposed to love its police ; in Chicago the affair is on the rocks . Determined to persuade the city to put a second man in all patrolling squad cars and to eliminate lie detector tests for recruits , Chicago 's finest started a " job action " ; they festooned almost anything that moved with tickets . Even Mayor Richard Daley was outraged . When Alderman Vito Marzullo discovered a ticket on his Cadillac , he was driven to philosophical speculation : " Are they performing their duties now , or have they neglected their duties in the past ? " <P> Chicagoans wonder if ticket blitzing is the proper role for their men in blue , whatever their grievances . When handed a summons for speeding , though she claims she was doing no more than 10 m.p.h. , a black woman cab driver fumed : " If they 're mad at someone , why do n't they go out and shoot hoodlums ?
