ONE reason that Congressmen may seem lacking in their grasp of the larger affairs of state is that they spend so much of their two-year terms trying to get reelected . It can be a draining , humbling and sometimes compromising rite . The process does , however , keep Congressmen close to the people , and it produces a biennial crop of interesting political personalities . Herewith the pick of the 435 races now being contested : <P> &gt;Massachusetts ' Twelfth Congressional District is a kind of political Wimbledon where the best two out of three sets mean a winner . Roughly one-third of the district-Cape Cod and the Nantucket Sound islands-is Yankee Republican . Another third-the depressed onetime whaling capital of New Bedford-is ethnically Democratic . The South Boston suburbs stretching from Weymouth to Plymouth are fiercely independent ; the candidate who can conquer them while holding his own bloc takes everything . <P> This year two personable contestants face one another in the Twelfth . Democrat Gerry Studds , 35 , is a former prep school teacher and Foreign Service officer who even learned Portuguese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Opponent William Weeks , 46 , is strictly Brahmin : Father Sinclair was Dwight Eisenhower 's Commerce Secretary ; Grandfather John was Coolidge 's Secretary of War . After graduating from Harvard , Weeks himself served for a time as an assistant dean of freshmen at the college . The two are running neck and neck , but McGovern liberalism is hurting Studds . <P> &gt; Boundaries and numbers have changed but to New Yorkers it is still the " Silk Stocking District . " This year 's challenger , Republican Jane Pickens Langley , 56 , one-third of the once renowned singing Pickens Sisters , seems to think that the House seat can be had for a song . It goes , " Jane Pickens Langley is a woman who cares. / Jane Pickens Langely is a woman who dares. / So pick good Pickens . " This singing commercial , taped in German , Italian , Spanish and Yiddish , underpins a breezy , almost folksy campaign against Incumbent Edward I. Koch , 47 , a hard-working Democrat . In his appearances at subway and bus stops , Koch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and emphasizes his recent proposal to admit Soviet Jews and Asian Ugandans to the U.S. without regard to immigration quotas . Given Koch 's popularity in the Silk Stocking District , there seems slight chance that the voters will pick Pickens . <P> &gt; Chicago Mayor Richard Daley is not known for missing political opportunities . Thus when reapportionment became necessary , he neatly obliterated the South Side congressional district of Abner Mikva , 46 , a respected Democratic independent . Forced to run elsewhere , Mikva chose a newly created , relatively conservative district on Chicago 's North Shore . Opposing him is Samuel H. Young , 49 , a suburban attorney and political activist in search of his first public office . Young 's campaign strategy is simple : to hang the McGovern albatross around Mikva 's neck .
