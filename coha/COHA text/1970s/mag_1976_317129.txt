" I 'd have followed him into the jaws of hell-and had a hard time catching up with him , " said an admiring captain . Lieut . General Robert L. Fair is headed for a more prosaic destination , however , and defenders of a tough , nononsense , old-style Army are dismayed . As of next week Fair , 52 , will retire for " personal reasons " - the most important being that he and his commanding officer hated each other 's guts . <P> When Fair became commander of the Army 's 50,000-man V Corps in West Germany last August , it was only a matter of time before he clashed with his boss , General George S. Blanchard , the U.S. Army 's European commander . Both men had won their commissions in the same year-1944-but Blanchard got his from West Point , and Fair was a tough , up-from-the-ranks infantryman who had gone on to officers ' school . <P> Though he was an expert in as sophisticated a field as electronic data processing , Fair preferred being known by nicknames like " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fanatic 's hatred of long hair , badly pressed uniforms and off-center name tags . Fair told the Army paper Stars and Stripes : " You have to reward and punish to get what you want done . " <P> Tough Guy . With some officers , Fair 's approach won plaudits . Novelist Josiah Bunting ( The Lionheads ) , an ex-major himself , praised Fair 's leathery style in a Playboy article last fall , describing the general as " an admirable soldier " who is " always in bristling motion . " But other officers , whose palms sweat when Fair raked them over with abrasive questions , disliked him intensely . To some enlisted men , Fair was a bush-league General Patton . <P> Blanchard fretted that Fair 's tough-guy approach might reverse the gradual improvement of morale from its post-Viet Nam nadir of racial conflict , drug abuse , alcoholism and boredom . A former commander of the 82nd Airborne Division , Blanchard , 55 , is no cream puff either . But by contrast with Fair , he adopted a more relaxed attitude toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , learn German and meet local people . He approached enlisted men as citizens in uniform . <P> Fair was abruptly relieved of his command early this month-though many corps veterans still believe the wrong general was sacked . Initially , Fair was to have retired with a three-star general 's pension-roughly $38,000 including various emoluments . But some Congressmen raised objections , and the Army retired him at his permanent two-star ( major general ) rank instead . That will cost the 32-year veteran as much as $3,000 a year .
