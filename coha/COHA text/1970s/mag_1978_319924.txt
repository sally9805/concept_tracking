E.M . FORSTER : A LIFE by P.N. Furbank Harcourt Brace Jovanovich ; 619 pages ; $19.95 <P> Novelist E.M . Forster 's beginnings did not promise a happy ending . There was , first of all , a hint of early mortality . His father , a feckless architect , died of tuberculosis in 1880 , less than two years after Edward Morgan was born . That left his care entirely to Lily , his formidable mother , and to a zealous battalion of female relatives and friends . They coddled him mercilessly , dressed him like a fop and spoke of him in his presence as " the Important One . " Naturally , the boy grew into a man thoroughly confused about his sex and spectacularly bumbling at practical affairs . He was 30 and the author of three respected novels before he gained a clear idea of how men and women actually perform intercourse . He was uncoordinated , ineffectual and absentminded . " I never saw anybody so incapable , " his mother once said , as if admiring her handiwork . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belief that telephone wires were hollow . <P> As it happened , Forster , the maladroit innocent , survived to age 91 . By and large , he did so happily , as this long , absorbing biography makes clear . Critic P.N. Furbank knew Forster during the author 's latter years and was eventually given access to previously suppressed papers and correspondence . Much of the material concerned Forster 's homosexuality , and his whole story could not have been told without it . He was one of the great English novelists of this century , but the foundations of his art rested on a buried life . <P> Had he been less decorous , tentative and shy , Forster could have admitted his sexual preferences early and slipped into the fashionable demimonde . He had private money and plenty of leisure . His contemporaries at Cambridge and , later , in London 's Bloomsbury circle tolerated and applauded eccentricities . But Forster never wanted notoriety or much attention at all . His retiring manner earned him the nickname " the taupe " ( the mole ) from Lytton Strachey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James , the young author was comically unassuming : " I hear he likes people to be handsome and well dressed , so I shall fail all round . " He even construed his repressions as an example of good manners : " However gross my desires , I find I shall never satisfy them for the fear of annoying others . " <P> Such tensions might have destroyed him . Instead , they lent rare power to his fiction . He learned to see two distinct ways of life . One belonged to the smug , narrow , easily shocked circle populated by his mother and her friends . The other possessed his imagination : total friendship , passionate , uninhibited and free , with a like spirit . Artistically , Forster did not want to choose , to become simply a novelist of manners or a poet of pleasures . The motto of his fourth novel , Howards End ( 1910 ) , captured both the dilemma and the hope : " Only connect . "              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
