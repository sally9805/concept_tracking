" I hate the kind of pest who just drops in ! " No , it would have been much more like his father to have phoned first . Unless something was wrong . Was something wrong ? Someone sick ? Dead ? One of his grandparents ? But a phone call from home would have taken care of that . His mother ? Something insidious and creeping they had held off telling him about , until it was no longer possible to keep it from the only child - of a dying woman ? . . . Cancer ? Lenny turned quickly away from the window . He listened inwardlyto the sound of his father 's voice as it came to him over the phone a little while ago , and he knew that his mother was all right . Whatever it was , it was not that . He had interpreted too many vibrations in his father 's voice not to be able to define limits . He could never be sure exactly what those vibrations meant , but he could be pretty sure what they did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father came soon , they could get away to dinner before Bob came banging in . The combination of David Lang and Bob Rohrmoser made Lenny uneasy . Not that his father was embarrassing out of his age group . On the contrary , he was too good . David Lang gave out with a special obligingness and a special wit in the presence of his son 's friends . There was , however , just one thing wrong with that father-of-the-year act : it was an act . His friends laughed , thought Mr. Lang very amusing , but always there was the slightly sour aftertaste , the lingering sense of phoniness . His father came on strong with his friends , but Lenny knew that that spontaneity was for his sake , for the sake of the son of David Lang , and not for the sake of David Lang 's irrepressibleself . David Lang was not a natural clown or a born character . That was the sad thing . Lenny heard the door signal clatter below . He strode quickly out of the room , took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heavy door with the lace curtain . " Hi . " " Hello , " said his father . " Come on in. "  |p77His  father scraped his shoes on the mat , looking at what Lenny knew he would look at , in the way Lenny had anticipated he would look at it . " So , " said his father , " you had to have your share of hair . " Lenny smiled . He just managed not to put his fingers to his mustache , but he was very conscious of it , silky , new-fledged . He was proud of the character it had taken , a distinctive Stephen Crane drape at the ends . It was ragged without being raunchy . " My room 's up here , " Lenny said . They mounted the steps , Lenny in front , his father behind . Lenny carried with him the image of his father as he had appeared in the doorway , and his sense of the particular increased . David Lang looked very much himself with his customary Harris tweed and his haggard-healthy look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell when and how much trouble might be oppressing his father . Right now , Lenny guessed at trouble of some sort . Not the eyes but the mouth , whose smile had n't quite surfaced to gladness . The door to Lenny 's room stood ajar , and Lenny motioned his father in . This was the first time his father would be seeing the new place . Lenny had lived in the dorm as freshman and sophomore . Now , a junior , he had put in with Bob Rohrmoser in this private house . It was a big , old-fashioned room with a high ceiling , hardwood floor , and a big silver radiator sizzling in one corner . Mrs. Martin , a divorced woman with two grown children living in other cities , managed a scrupulously clean house , four boarders , and a long affair with a member of the German department with no sense of discrepancy . Discreet herself , she asked no less of the college men under her roof . What the boys did was all right with her providing they kept it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's . But the clean chenille covers , the two maple dressers , the two small writing tables , the leather armchair , everything , in short , contributed to an atmosphere of traditional New England propriety . " Very nice , " David said . " Are you comfortable here ? " " Sure . "  | " Do you get along with this Bob Rohrmoser ? " " Oh , sure . He 's okay . You 'll probably meet him . I think you 'll like him . Why do n't you take that armchair , Dad . I 'll hang your coat away . " " And when did you grow that thing ? " his father asked . " Began in September , when I got here , " Lenny replied . " Does it bother you ? " " No , it does n't bother me at all , " David said , with a little smile . " It 's fine . If you like it . Do you ? " " Yes . " " Why ? " Lenny shrugged . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's natural . Hair grows on your face , you let it grow . " " Then why not a beard ? " " Maybe I 'll grow that , too . . . no , I wo n't grow a beard . I do n't know . You sort of experiment with things . " " Masculinity ? " asked David . " Maybe , " said Lenny . " All right , " the father sighed . " It 's good to see you anyway . You 've got exams coming up , have n't you ? " " Yes . " " Prepared ? " " I think so . " David nodded , looking round the room , his gaze coming to rest on the photograph on Lenny 's dresser . Lenny followed his father 's gaze and joined him in looking at the color photograph , the one taken on the front lawn of the house , with his father standinghands in pockets , and his mother reaching out toward a blaze of pink azaleas . " How 's Mom ? " Lenny asked . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't come with you ? " His father turned his eyes back to him . " That 's about the third time you 've asked me that , Lenny , I told you I was seeing someone in Albany . How could she come with me if I did n't know I was coming myself ? "  | " Oh , yes . I forgot . " " Have you been doing much skiing ? " " Just started , really , " Lenny answered . " There has n't been much on the slopes till recently . " " I hope you 're being careful . " " Yes , indeed . . . Who 'd you see in Albany ? " " Someone on the school board , " David answered , looking toward the window . Lenny , sitting on the edge of Bob 's bed , thought he caught in his father 's manner the flat quality that marked certainmoods , moods that had their roots in ground other than the one he seemed to be treading with such patience . " Incidentally , " David went on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Rich "  --  David broke off and grimaced  --  " I do n't know why I keep saying Rich  --  not Rich , actually  --  a fellow by the name of Buchholz  --  Ted Buchholz . " " Selling out ? " Lenny said with surprise , grasping that this was the matter , or part of it . " No kidding ? Why 'd you do that for ? " " Conflict of interest , " his father answered promptly . " Not that Rich and I were n't getting along . He saw an opportunity to convertthe business into something more profitable , and he was quite right . It 's just that it would n't have been right for me . At any rate , I do n't want you worrying . I get a sizable amount of money on the sale , and more to come over the next few years . So all foreseeable needs will be taken care of . " Lenny nodded slowly . " I 'm not worried , " he said , and was n't , not about family funds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Go back to the magazines ? Write another novel ? " You got some other business in mind ? " Lenny asked . His father shook his head , saying , " No , not at this time , " and Lenny knew that selling out was indeed only part of it , because his father had proclaimed more times than he probably remembered that God , before His abdication , had performed one last minor miracle in providing for David Lang . That business , with Rich as partner . A perfect life solution . For reasons too far off for instant recognition , Lenny 's attentiveness sharpened . " Is that why you came up here ? " he asked  | " Is what why I came up here ? " " To tell me that ? " " Not exactly . But it is of family interest , is n't it ? " " Yes , it is , " Lenny said . " Then why 'd you have to see a client in Albany if you 've sold out ? " Lenny watched the faint , prideful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Would he ever get over the amazement that his own flesh and blood had a brain ? Five years ago , he could take his father in chess , but the elder Lang still went on celebrating symptoms of intelligence in his son . And it was n't only the intelligencethat floored his father , but the different kind of intelligence . As though he could n't believe that he had contributed to nature 's variety . " My selling out did n't relieve me of all  --  " began David , stopping at the crash below . " Bob  --  " Lenny said , as thunder rolled up the stairs , and in another second Bob had flung open the door like some goddam character in a biblical play . Job or somebody , all whiskers and doom . " That prick ! That infinite prick of infinite misery ! " " Bob  --  " Lenny said , indicating . Bob looked , and saw , but he was too far gone in his rush for any checks . " Donovan ! " he croaked . " Five fucking essay-type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Explain Skinner 's Behaviorism briefly  --  briefly ! " " This is my father , Bob , " Lenny said . " Pleased to meetcha , " Bob said , shaking hands . " Sorry about the language . We just got butchered in psych . " David nodded , smiled . " I 'm sorry to hear that , " he said . " But I 'm sure you passed . " " Thanks . I hope so . If I do n't get my average up , I 'll be assdeepin the rice paddies of Vietnam . " Bob and his dramatics . Lenny could see that his father had alreadytaken to Bob . Everybody took to Bob . You could n't attributeany of the really depressing aspects of life to such a face.  |p81Round  , a nubby nose , nubby cheeks , and a coppery outcropping of beard that looked ready to give off sparks . " Say , you know , " Bob suddenly burst out , " I read your novel , Mr. Lang . The one about the war . Another Sky , was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean , you know , given the time and the subject and everything . The part that knocked me out was that bit about the Canadian Air Force girl  --  " " Oh , God ! " Lenny murmured. "  --  telling the guy she charged for a shack job . " " Why do n't you sit down ? " Lenny suggested . " Or fall down . Or something . " Bob grinned . He was wearing old-fashioned galoshes , open , and the tops flowered like great black petals . " Do you mind my saying that ? " he asked . " No , I do n't mind , " David said . " I 'm impetuous , " explained Bob . " Ask Lenny . " " Ask me , " Lenny confirmed sorrowfully . " Anyway , it was a good job , that book . " " Thank you , " said David . Bob turned to Lenny . " Hey , how come you did n't tell me your father was coming ? " " This was a surprise visit , " David @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You can stay here , Mr. Lang . I can sack in with somebody else . " " That wo n't be necessary , " David said . " Look , Lenny , why do n't you get some of your friends together , and we 'll all go to dinner . This will be my party . Bob ? You 'll join us , wo n't you ? And anyone else you 'd like to have along . Girls , if they 're available . I would n't in the least mind the company of girls . " " You sure you want to do that ? " Lenny asked , skeptical of the time and the occasion . " Are n't you tired ? " " Not a bit , " his father replied . " Hey , great ! " Bob encouraged . " We can ask Mike . " " Who 's Mike ? " David asked . " Mike Talbot , " Lenny said . " A friend . " " Mike is welcome . "  | " Vera ? " Bob offered again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " David asked Bob . " Sort of . . . How about Kathy ? " Lenny was waiting for it , and there it was , that careful indifference , that pussyfooting , nonprying , mouse-trapping casualness . " Is Kathy your girlfriend ? " his father asked . " No , Kathy is not my girlfriend , " Lenny replied . " She 's just a friend . " " Well , Kathy is welcome , whoever she is . " " That 's five , " said Lenny . " That 's plenty . Dad , are you sure you want to take that many people to dinner ? " " Positive . "  |p83The  car gave another turn to Lenny 's attention . It was parked at the curb in front of the house when he , his father , and Bob came out into the cold , snow-cushioned night . Lenny glanced at it impersonally , not connecting it with his father at all , a nice red foreign job with a powdering of snow on the roof and hood . Desire gave Lenny 's heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wipers swinging , was Vera 's fat old Buick . " How do you like it ? " came unexpectedly from his father . " Like what ? " Lenny asked . " The car , " his father said , pointing . " That ? Is that yours ? " His father said that it was , that it was his not by rental but by purchase , and Lenny felt the same nameless discomfort and guilt that always came over him whenever his father would reach out and cup the back of his neck in his hand , bringing his reluctant head against the fatherly shoulder . As they walked to Vera 's car ( David had warned that they all could n't go in his car , that it was too small , and Lenny had previsioned some skimpy orphan of the rental lots , pale coffee in color , unbeauteous in every detail , not because his father had no taste but because it had always been his father 's attitude to be contemptuous of style in cars ) , Lenny knew that there must be circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despair . That was not David Lang 's car . Not naturally . David Lang was a swinger in principle , but in practice he was as conservativeas a clock . Mike Talbot was already waiting for them in the back seat . The girls had picked him up on the way over . Lenny and Bob got in beside Mike , leaving David to share the front seat with the girls . Introductions were made in the car . The girls said how nice it was of Mr. Lang to invite them to dinner , they did appreciate it , and David Lang allowed that the pleasure was his , and Lenny 's senses puzzled over the mingled perfumes , his father , the visit , the car , heading out to dinner with such unaccountable elements . " Anybody know where we 're going ? " Vera asked as she moved the car away from the curb . " How about the inn ? " suggested Kathy . " Hell , no , " said Bob . " They start zapping you with the Vermont death-ray look at nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Horn ? " Mike suggested . " Is n't that kind of expensive ? " Kathy said . David spoke up : " My son probably kept from you the fact that his father is a very rich man . I 've recently sold my oil holdings , so The Powder Horn does n't frighten me in the least . " The girls laughed . Lenny looked at the back of his father 's head , pleased with the way he 'd handled that . That was good Lang vintage . That 's the way it usually began . The beginnings were always best , because they had the benefit of surprise and David Lang 's curious half-British , half-New York accent . Lenny wondered for the thousandth time where his father had ever picked it up . " Ear ! If you have an ear you do n't have to carry around dialectsthe whole of your life . " Maybe  --  but then you were stuck with whatever you made for yourself , and what his father had made for himself was distinctive all right , and hard to locate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taint of the fake . Like one of those old Shakespearian actors . Voice training . Lenny made a sharp inward turn away from his own critical thoughts , and the instant reaction was a flood of feeling tasting ofp85the ocean bed of his life . He turned away from that too , and listened to Bob 's cantering account of a student committee session with the vice-chancellor in charge of admissions . The vicechancellorhad agreed to the committee 's program for black studentrecruitment , pending , of course , approval of the Board . " Big deal , " Mike remarked , undisguised in his scorn . Lenny hoped that Mike would n't come down too hard on Bob . Mike had no use for the committee , considered it a collection of hand-picked finks . Not that Bob was a fink , but he just did n't see that all the talking had changed nothing and would change nothing . In a way , Bob was like his father : he believed in the mystical value of talk . If you went on talking long enough , you would wake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differences reconciled . Which was strictly bullshit . Real changes made people uncomfortable , and as long as people remained comfortable you could be sure there were no important changes coming about . Brought back to his father , Lenny again experienced that familiartime-brewed taste of his own beginning . He did n't know why , but every time he was drawn back his mind touched in passing that green wool sweater his mother had knit for him when he was five or six . She had knit many sweaters for him , but that 's the one that had trapped in its weave the flavor of the past . And with the sweater would always come the memory of snow and a sled and his father pulling him along over a dazzle of white , the sun a bright somnolence in his eyes . Just that  --  sweater , sled , snow , sun  --  and he was one million golden years into prehistory . He had revealed to no one his earliest memories , not even to Marie , to whom he loved to bring favors of reminiscence because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vagueness nor embarrassmentthat prevented him from sharing these secrets , but a feeling of sacred privacy that exposure would profane . Like the push-pedal fire engine he had wanted so badly and which had appearedone morning in a splash of holy light on the living room floor . Paintings of the Christ child with their radiant centers subsequentlyreminded him of that miraculous morning . And the countless mornings and afternoons riding the car seat beside hisp86mother . The smell of her , the intense smell and feel of her as she had lifted him in and lifted him out , had saddled him into the shopping carts and rode him through the cookie canyons . Was there enough silt in the years ahead to cover that ? The hills of home had bright green and red labels , and the floor of earth was loomed of nylon twist . Whenever he made that brief inward trip ( something in the nature of the journey always assured its brevity ) , he would come away with a consciousness encircled by two equators . His mother and his father . The radiation from each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the other pulsed in irregular flares . He was loved , all right . Memory went back through geological layers of it , and if it went back far enough the two equators merged into one band of brightness . It was when he moved up that the separation occurred . It was when he moved up still further that his love-heated planet cooled and the crust formed and the features showed . It was a teeming world of school and seashore summers and indoor winters and Scrooge and The Nutcracker Suite and Macy 's and Thanksgiving and the amazing city that bedecked itself once a year . They had stored this inventory in order to give him the universe a piece at a time . And they , too , were having it again by having it with him . Of course he had never made that distinction at the time , but later he knew it to be true . It seemed as though it would never end , but it did . Abruptly . Not that there were no more things , but it was no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't want it from them . Suddenly the value of a thing , anything , consisted solely in discoveringit for himself . Or with a friend . In one way or another , each in his own way , they gave him his freedom in a way that was not freedom . They wanted to share his discoveries , his freedom , to talk about the music and the hair and the heroes  --  and it was all so hopeless , because it was only information to them , and for him I .. it was the beginning of history . He had learned how to protect himself from love.  |p87The  Powder Horn was five miles out of town on a snowy road . Vera drove sanely for a change , skidding only once . The rear end of the car slewed around to the right , but Vera drove on withouttouching the brake . No comment . From anyone . The headlightscarved a tunnel of light into the darkness . Snowflakes rushed at the windshield . The wipers brushed them away with metronomic patience . Twenty-five years ago the restaurant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some interior decorator had tracked down in the shops of New York just the right artifacts for a rural restaurant . Early American , every stick . Crossed sabersand rotting flintlocks on the wall . They checked their coats . Lenny noticed his father survey the amplitude of thigh exposed by Kathy and Vera in the miniskirts . A black bow tie found them a table . David Lang asked his young companions what they would like to drink , and Mike was the first to inform him that he would have nothing , thank you , because he had no intention of going through the Vermont nonsense of producing his ID card . " Streng verboten in Vermont , Mr. Lang , under twenty-one . " " Well , in that case I do n't have to have liquor either , " David said . " That 's ridiculous , " Kathy protested . " You had a long drive from New York . I do n't see why you should be deprived . " " And you ? " David asked her . " Are you also below the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Just between us , I 'm trying to keep my status with the younger set . " The rest were under twenty-one . David yielded and ordered a scotch and soda . The others ordered soft drinks , except Mike , who ordered nothing . When the drinks were brought , David lifted his glass and proposed a toast to all their futures . It was n't exactly a silly thing to do , but Lenny felt embarrassed . He glanced at Mike , who was showing his teeth in an amused grin . Mike wore metal-frame eyeglasses and wrested " A 's " in almost all his courses with fang and claw . He went to this " dumb little middle-class seminary " because it was the first one to come throughp88with a full tuition scholarship . Mike not only needed but insisted on every gratuity the world had going . A matter of principle . Mike Talbot was clever and caustic and uncompromising to the point of lunacy , and there were plenty who hated him for it . Bob Rohrmosermade it a masochistic point of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made it an intellectual point of honor to befriend and defend Mike 's abrasiveness . But Mike 's smile had made Lenny apprehensive . The girls kept up the small chatter needful to the occasion . Conversation was naturally limited when a parent was present . So Vera asked Mr. Lang where he had gone to college , and did he find schools very much different these days ? Mr. Lang replied that he really did n't know if colleges were different these days . He assumed they were from what he read , but that visiting schools , for him , was a matter of walking round and round the ivied walls , peering into halls and rooms , but knowing no more about the spirit within than an Australian bushman . A waitress came to take their orders . Then Kathy remarked how envious she was of the Langs , living right in New York . " Not in New York , " David corrected her . " Long Island . " Kathy said that was close enough . She was mad about New York , had an aunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christmas holiday , was looking forward to that . " Do n't you love it , Mr. Lang ? " " I do n't know , " David confessed . " I do and I do n't . Certainly I did love it at one time , but it 's changed so much . I 've tried to accustom myself to the changes , but I do n't think I 've been suc-cessful . " " Do n't you like changes , Mr. Lang ? " Mike Talbot asked . " Yes , I like changes , " David answered pleasantly . " I like changes that bring about an improvement , changes that make things better . " " What 's better ' ? " Mike asked . " Oh , I do n't know . Do n't you think the great majority of people would agree on what 's better ? Clean streets are better than dirty streets , would n't you say ? "  | " Maybe , " Mike said , " as a matter of hygiene . But as a step in the leveling process , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up for a change . " Lenny observed the change of expression on his father 's face as his father became aware of Mike Talbot . David Lang did not like Mike Talbot , as , Lenny now realized , it was inevitable that he should not . For Mike was one of those chrome-plated , surgical personalities that the father of Lenny Lang so despised . There was a covert little flush of satisfaction in this for Lenny , because he had never been a match for his father 's verbal quickness , and Mike was . That was the advantage that had compelled so many silences in Lenny where his father was concerned  --  that quick and easy assembly of words . And even that would n't have bothered Lenny so much if his father had n't used the facility to demonstrate that the old man was n't going to be so easy to put down . A game . Scoring points . And after the points were scored , his father would try to get at what was really on his mind , and that was when Lenny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Coke glass before him , Lenny heard his father say , " I ca n't see that that 's a particularly useful symbol . I 'd much rather have the bad areas improved  --  as I 'm sure the peopleliving in the bad areas would too . " " Well , Mr. Lang , " Mike said , glints of debating fire showing in his white teeth , his glasses , " I 'm not so sure . " Lenny felt a tentative touch on the toe of his shoe . Another . He glanced up . Kathy was looking at him , her wide eyes pantomimingalarm at what looked to be an impending Talbot bombingraid . Lenny dropped his gaze . " Really ? " said his father . " How so ? " Another two taps on Lenny 's shoe , signaling stand-by alert . He was both grateful and annoyed  --  grateful that the rescue operation was on hand if needed , annoyed at Kathy 's continued motheringsince their period in the sack had ended . That was almost six months ago , for Christ sake ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing . " Well , look at it this way , Mr. Lang , " Mike said . " When you'vep90got an infection , you do n't want to keep putting on local dressings forever . You want it out . You want the thing lanced and the pus running . " " Mike , " Kathy put in , " you are the absolute world 's winner when it comes to pleasant table talk . Do you think we could change the subject ? " " Sure , " Mike said cheerfully . " How about homes and gardens ? " Lenny glanced at his father and saw scorings in the pale flesh that neither Mike Talbot nor mere time could have put there . With a shock , Lenny saw the deepness of his father 's nervous exhaustion , and he was confirmed at last in his suspicion of some profound change . He reached out with his mind , but he could n't as yet make out the dimensions of the sudden recess he had discovered in the retaining wall of his life.  |p91They  drove to the ski area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ride , the scenery  --  and his father agreed . This was after breakfast , after his father had driven over from the Clear Acres Motel . Despite Bob Rohrmoser 's repeated offers to " sack in elsewhere , " his father had insisted on returning to his motel after dinner . Lenny was aware how badly his father wanted and needed privacy . Fatigue had eaten into his face like chemicals on film . After that exchange with Mike , his father had kept up conversation with obvious effort , nodding , smiling , putting in a question now and then , but in no way his usual self . This was David Lang in withdrawal , beat . Although he did look somewhat better as they had breakfast in the drugstore , at the counter . His face was shaved , composed , redolent of his customary after-shave lotion , but the eyes were still punishingly marked , and from time to time he would narrow his lids , as if even these anemic fluorescents were inadmissibly bright . " You feeling okay ? " Lenny had asked . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A little tired , perhaps . These last few months have been hectic . But I 'm fine . " Lenny did n't believe he was fine at all . He was convinced now that his father was never further from fine , and that the trouble was located where he first suspected it to be located . The domes/tic scene . Mother and father . The long murmurs behind closed doors . Silences whose bulk and weight he could calculate with the expertness of an old postal clerk . Talk that was set down word by word , like bricks , until the two of them were effectually sealed off from each other . All that hiding and decorum for his sake , of course . Everything was for the best in the best of all possible etceteras . Therefore he never knew what was really bothering them . Sex ? No love ? Boredom ? Lenny mused on these things as he turned his father 's astonishinglyunlikely little foreign job into the road leading to the ski slopes . " How come such an un-Langish job ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keys and said , " You drive . " His father had replied , " Maybe you 're out of touch with what 's Langish these days . " Maybe . Very possible . The truth , the sad truth , was that he was n't very interested . Whose fault ? His ? Theirs ? No one 's , of course . He loved them , all right . They were the single band of brightness and the double equator of his beginning . And they loved him ! But despite the love , he had only to turn his thoughts in their direction to feel his arms pinioned and his lungs taking in the narcotic air of that tranced world where people sat around and talked while Lee Harvey Oswald 's bullet passed right through them and left them still talking about plays and books and art and progress and The New York Times . His mother and father were part of that world , and to understand them he would have to understand that world , and he could n't because he just could n't stay with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love or trouble with sex they might be having , that trouble was somehow rooted in that tranced world . As they passed beneath a rust-colored , jagged cliff of granite , his father said , " Do you like this boy , Mike Talbot ? " " Yes , " Lenny replied , " I like him . He goes too far sometimes , but he 's sharp . " " Yes , he is , " said his father . " Cuttingly . " " He 's not your type , is he ? " Lenny said . " No , " his father admitted . " I 've known such boys at one timep93or another in my life , and I must admit I 've never liked them . We used to play a game called King of the Hill . ' The idea was to push off all corners and hold the top at whatever cost . A hot and pointless game . It seems to me your friend , Mike , plays king of the intellectual ice hill . His game is cold and pointless . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lenny said . " Then why does n't he have that effect on you ? " " Because I do n't think his game is pointless . " " I see . Well , perhaps you 're right . " Lenny was about to say something else , but his father had turned away and was gazing out the car window . They came to that sudden retreat in the hills , and the sun blazed on a meadow of new snow . Lenny glanced and saw his father shade his eyes with his hand . His father had no sunglasses . He was wearing a business suit and his raglan overcoat , and Lenny with his down jacket and ski goggles felt remorse lodge in his throat like a bone . " What 's the matter , Dad ? " he asked . His father turned his head , looking straight ahead , narrowing his eyes . " Things have n't been going well between Mother and me . " A flat truck piled hugely with sawn logs swayed toward them on the narrow road . Lenny jockeyed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He wished this moment of reprieve would last indefinitely . He felt an old familiar guilt and resentment . It was comparable to the feeling he experienced when some teacher announceda surprise quiz . . . . " The material has been covered . " . . . The material , indeed , had been covered . " I know , " he said . " You do ? " " I know there 's no great happiness . " " You 're not the first to tell me that , " his father said . " Apparently there are none so blind . But I am surprised . I did n't think that the absence of great happiness could be taken as the presence of great unhappiness . " " It was n't that , " Lenny said . " What was it , then ? "  |p94Lenny  did n't know what it was . How could you process ten thousand seconds and drop an answer in one ? " I do n't know , Dad . " Out of the corner of his eye , Lenny caught his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sign of the father 's acknowledgment of the son 's latest defection . A voice spoke to Lenny : " Give , give endlessly , but for God 's sake do n't ask for five cents ' worth of recompense , because when you do you 'll be told , I do n't know . ' His stomach tightened . He said , " You lived such separate lives . " " Separate ? " " I mean , you walked around in the same house , you talked , you ate at the same table , but you never seemed to be sharing anything . " Again Lenny spied the nod . " And did we share anything with you ? " his father asked . " Aw , come on , Dad  --  " " No , no wait , " his father interrupted him . " Since you 've brought up this subject of sharing , let 's talk about it . I know how popular it is with your set to think of its parents as having lived in a perpetual night of noncommunication , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , at least as much as children are willing to share with their parents . Let me tell you something  --  " What David Lang wished to tell , Lenny Lang already knew . " Your invisible room . . . " his father said . How he had stored everything away in his invisible room . All the distinctions and judgments and likes and dislikes of his developing life . . . " It was you who walked through the rooms of your house , " his father accused him . " You who opened the refrigerator , watched TV , said good morning and good night , discussed finances , and were terriblyshocked  --  I remember this well  --  you were terribly shocked when President Kennedy was murdered , but of what you were really feeling you said nothing . And there was no lack of interest , Lenny . You were asked . God knows how many times you were asked , but all I or your mother ever got was a shrug , or a mumble , or a sigh of impatience . And you make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home puking sick from that nice suburban boys and girls party . We took a drive the next day , if you remember . . . . " Oh , he did remember ! He remembered that drive very well ! The god-awful make-believe of his father talking to him about sex . It was as if his father had taken him into his bedroom and opened drawers in which were collected old condoms , pro kits , and dirty pictures . It was n't supposed to be that way . It was straight and seriousand  --  God knows !  --  well-intentioned , but that 's the way it came out . Maybe it was because it was too late . Maybe it was because he knew all these things . Maybe it was because his father had come on too strong about being a father and not strong enough about being a man . And so he had sat in the old station wagon on that rainy day listening to his father go on about sex and drugs while the insistent rain was slashed left and right by the insistent wipers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood stream that first time when the car was new and he had been sandwiched between his mother and father as they drove somewhere upstate in autumn to buy bittersweet and preserves and a pumpkin , which of course he had selected . " I remember , " he murmured . " Yes , I 'm sure you do , " said his father . " I do n't know , Lenny . Perhaps you were too young . Perhaps I was saying the wrong things , but I have tried , many times , to have that talk with you . After all , I 'm not my father . I 'm not Grandpa Sam . I 've read widely . I 've even written , as you know . I 've left myself open to ideas . I thought surely we would sit down one day and have that talk , you and I , but it has n't happened . There 's no getting away from the fact that it has n't happened . Never once did you tell me why you made the choices that you did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you hated . Perhaps you told your mother , but not me . " " I could n't , " Lenny said . " Neither you nor Mom . " " And why , may I ask ? Is it that you found us so stupid , so narrow ? " Lenny shook his head . He wished his father would drop thesep96stale hypocrisies . This endless digging for praise and validation . Both of them  --  his mother as well . No , they were n't stupid or narrow , and they knew it . They were clever and sophisticated . And he wished now that he had given sympathy  --  and no more ! Just said how sorry he was and let it go at that . Because he did feel sorry , and sympathetic . There was a great ball of it in him . Then why was he also angry ? Here , for the first time in his life , his father was making a direct plea for his sympathy , his understanding , and he felt angry ! Why ? " Did you ever tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " About your invisible room . About what you loved and hated . You told me things you thought it would be good for me to know . The truth I had to find out for myself . " " What truth ? " " Well , for one thing , the truth of what a lousy marriage you and Mom had . " " And when did you discover that ? " " I do n't know . A long time ago , I guess . Look , Dad , I 'm awfullysorry about what 's happened . Really I am . " " But I 'd like to know when you made that discovery , " his father insisted . " Or if not when , then how . " " I would n't know how to explain it , " Lenny said . " Try . You do quite well on explanations when you put your mind to it . " " That deadness , " Lenny said . " Deadness ? " " I mean that deadness between you and Mom . That 's been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must take your word for that , Lenny . I would n't have thought so . God knows things were n't perfect between us , but I never would have described the situation as dead . . . deadness ! " " Well , okay  --  you 're probably right about that , " Lenny said quickly , thinking he saw a way to extricate himself . " My choice in words is never the best . " It was awful . Everything he said came back to him with a cold ,  |p97uncaring  ring . And he did n't feel that way . He did n't ! He wanted to give his father the truth , because this was one time he felt sure that the truth was exactly what his father craved ; but each time he touched what he thought was the truth it fragmented , fell into pieces . What he should do was shut up . Cut his losses . Right now . But he knew he could n't shut up , and he knew why . His father was asking for a very small payment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You say I never told you what I loved and what I hated . Do you realize that I could n't ? I never learned how to from you  --  or Mom . Things were n't to be loved or hated , that 's the impression I got all my life . You did n't love or hate , you just understood , and that 's bullshit , Dad . The world is full of things to be loved and hated , but I could never find out from you or Mom what those things were . There was always this side and that side to everything . I never really found out what you felt , and so I never could get to know you as people . As parents , yes , but not as people . And that 's why I do n't know how to feel about what you 've told me . I do n't know who to blame and who to feel sorry for . " " Good God , Lenny , I did n't tell you this for the sake of partiality ! I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what hurts me , is that you seem to feel nothing . " " But that 's not so , " Lenny returned . " I feel rotten ! I know that if anything happens  --  a separation , a divorce  --  I know how lonely you 'll both be . Do you think that makes no difference to me ? " And somehow that too was not the right thing to say . Lenny could see from his father 's profile that he still had n't said the right thing . He was indeed sorry , but it was not the intimate family sorrow his father had been looking for . Nor had he explained the other thing well at all . The trouble was that he could n't use the words he would have to use to tell the truth as he saw the truth . Such words would sound stupid and pretentious , and worst of all they 'd be pointlessly hurtful . He could n't use that one encompassingword  --  passion . He could n't say  --  what a hell of a thing it would be for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passion in their lives . Not against injustice , not for a better world , not for each other  --  but only for him  --  only for him !  --  only for him !  |p98The  ski lodge was crowded . Several rows of chairs faced the picturewindow which gave out on the final run where all the slopes converged . Lenny would have liked his father to sit there and see the action , but all the seats were taken . They went to the cafeteriafor coffee , and when they returned to the main room there were a couple of vacant seats . They watched the skiers . " Is it difficult ? " David asked . " Not very , " Lenny replied . " No more difficult than ice skating . Easier , I think . You 'd have no trouble with it . You 've got good reflexes , and you 're in good shape . " " For my age ? " David asked , smiling . " For any age . " " Somehow I do n't think I 'd survive , " David said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Balance , " Lenny informed his father . He went on to explain the skills and joys of skiing . He realized his father had shifted their talk to other grounds because the first had been so full of land mines . Lenny would have liked to retract it all , to wipe out that half-hour from both their minds and give his father what he had come to Vermont to find . Even as he talked about skiing , another part of his mind went over their conversation in the car , testing to see if it was perhaps less fearsomely frank than he thought . It began with Mike . Hep99had said that he did n't find Mike 's game so pointless , whatever that meant , and then his father had told him about things at home , and then came the invisible rooms , and then the love and the hate business , and then the lousy marriage . Eeee ! He had said " lousy marriage " ! To his father ! And deadness ! Dear God , take it away ! Make it not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't be unsaid , and there was n't a dab of balm to be had from the whole raw mess ! So Lenny played on skiing as though it were an opera , he taking all the parts , putting into it lyricism and love . . . . See , Dad , I can share things with you . My invisible room has twenty inches of snow , and this is what I do and how I feel about it . Welcome to it . I have profound respect for you  --  and love  --  and whatever a son is supposed to have  --  I do "  --  and as you get more and more confidence , " Lenny said , " you get to shift your weight from ski to ski , and that 's the whole trick . What 's so nice about it  --  " " Why did n't you bring your equipment ? " his father broke in . " Why should I have ? What would you do , sit here and watch me ski ? " " I would n't mind that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sure you can , but  --  " " Then do . Even if for only an hour . " " No . " " Lenny , do n't be ridiculous . How much does it cost to rent the stuff ? " " I do n't know  --  about six , seven dollars . " " Then do . I 'll pay for it . " " " Dad , I do n't want to . " " Yes , you do , and I want you to . I want to see how well you ski . " They fenced in that silly way for a few more minutes , and the elder Lang finally prevailed . Lenny went to rent the equipment . He put on the boots , then walked outside on the terrace and showed himself to his father on the other side of the window . His father nodded and smiled  |p100Riding  the chair up to the top , Lenny told himself that he could easily have forestalled anything like this from happening had he not worn his down jacket and corduroy pants . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slacks , shirt , tie , etcetera . So there must have been a little ember of unquenched hope smoldering away . Why was it that parents did so much for their kids , always putting themselves second ? Would he be subject to the same unimaginablechange ? It did n't seem possible . Although he 'd heard from others about parents who lived their lives as though having children were of no more consequence than a case of measles  --  a periodof quarantine and then everybody goes his own way . Kathy , for one , who 'd made so complete a break with her parents that it was doubtful she 'd ever go home . At least that 's what she said . She was going to New York , to join Brian Miller , of all the dumb things ! That shit , Brian Miller ! Lenny experienced a twinge of sex revulsion in his thoughts of Kathy . It was really strange how turned off you could get about a girl . Sexually , that is . He liked Kathy . She was honest . But in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for prize money . Once she got going all contact was between the legs . Feeling and fucking were one , and she was always out to establish records . That could be fun for a while , but then something happened . What had happened to him was a sort of cunt hostility . Actually . The whole nerve complex that was his sex response tightened up like a sphincter at the thought of Kathy . It was a good thing she had become interested in Brian when she did . And he in Marie . Lenny 's thoughts switched to Marie as he neared the top . This was the high point of the lift . A skier shot beneath him , plowing deep into powder . Lenny knew the path . There was one bad spot . You had to turn quickly if you did n't want to wrap yourself around a tree . He decided he 'd take that path , even though he was a little afraid of it . Too bad his father could n't see him on the really difficultpart of the run . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decline away from the lift . He inserted his gloved hands through the loopsp101of the poles . . . . And how he wished Marie were here ! Not in Cleveland bridesmaiding some damn cousin 's wedding , but here ! . . . He skated on his skis over the level ground , coming to the first hill , which he took without a turn ; and then the next , steeper hill , on which he had to turn often to avoid moguls ; and then he came to the split in the path , taking the one to the left , the less used one , where the powder was deep , and he picked up speed , riding back on his skis to keep from nosing too deeply into the snow . When speed threatened to overwhelm his control , he turned , slowing , scraping up a flurry . Several times he fell , ass over tip , feeling the always surprising coldness of the snow on his face , down his neck . Then the trickiest part of it was over , and Lenny skied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ease of the naturals who became one swiveled synchronization of skis , knees , hips , and shoulders . He 'd never be champ , but he was good enough to make the wind whistle and to feel his body do its best in balance and reflex , and by all this speed and whip and sweet presence of body to be lifted unreachably above all intimations of decay and death  --  and to come , at the bottom , to a right-angle stop , arching a wave of white before him . He looked toward the lodge and saw his father standing at the window , one arm raised in a salute to his performance . Lenny motioned that he would take another run , and his father nodded assent . He took two more runs in all , then he turned in the equipmentand joined his father in the lodge . The sky had again turned overcast , and it looked like more snow . " I think , " said his father , " that I 'll start for home right now . "  |p102It  was on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any **25;12335;TOOLONG but way back into his cosmic beginning . Lenny felt the kind of shake that topples buildings . He wanted to run , but his hands were gripping the steering wheel of a car . His mother and father ! The solid earth of home and love , school and city , past and present , all points fixed , all points known ! That shakeJI would change the contour of everything , and there would be fissuresten miles deep . He would have to map out a new terrain . And what would they do ? A fierce resentment took hold of him . EI ' What right had they ? After all the years , they surely could live the balance with whatever was bothering them ! No , that was ridiculous . They were n't that old , and if they were unhappy together why then of course they 'd have to split . It happens every day . How many of his friends ' parents were divorced ? His mind played with it reasonably for a full minute , and then he felt another ternblor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and resentment , he spoke : " It would have been different if you and Mom were engaged in something  --  you know , where there would have been a clash of interests or careers- " His father made an explosive little noise which Lenny took for one awful second to be the onset of tears . He had never seenp103his father cry . But his father was n't crying . He was smiling and shaking his head . " You 'd be surprised how engaged I am , " his father said . " Yes ? " Lenny said , intending no irony . " In what ? " " Oh  --  in living . " Lenny tested the remark for facetiousness and found none . He turned his eyes back to the road , touching for the first time the periphery of David Lang 's life  --  not his father 's life , but David Lang 's . It was a new sensation . They were silent for several seconds , then his father said , " You know , Lenny , even if something were to happen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of the world . " " Nothing is the end of the world , " Lenny said . " True , " said his father . " As far as you 're concerned , there 's no distinction to be made between your mother and me . You are cared for . By both . You do know that , do n't you ? " " I know that . " He knew that  --  and that was about the extent of knowledge they 'd given him about their lives . Maybe it had to be that way . Maybe it was best that way . What would he do with all the informationif they started to unload on him now ? . . . Lenny braked the car as they came to a narrow bridge . The stream that ran in the gulley to the right curved and flowed under the bridge . There was snow on the banks , and a short shelf of ice grew from the banks above the flow of the stream . He would live someplace not too far from scenes like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would make it his life 's business to be near something like this . . . . On the other side of the bridge , a dumb collie darted out , stopped , crouched in fear , and Lenny had to swing sharply to the left . His father lurched against him . The contact seemed to jostle their thoughts into alignment . A moment later his father said , " I was surprised to learn that Bob Rohrmoser had read my book . I did n't know you kept a copy with you . " " Why should n't I ? " Lenny said . " There 's no reason you should n't . Of course . Perhaps my sur/prise was due to the fact that I never really knew if you had readit . " " Now why would you think something like that ? " Lenny returned . " Why would n't I have read my own father 's novel ? As a matter of fact , I 've read it several times . I do n't even remember when the first time was , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read it again about five years ago . It meant a little more to me then . Last year  --  no , it was this year , about in March , I read it again . " " Well , I did n't know that , you see , " said his father . " We 've never discussed it . " No , they had n't discussed it , and Lenny 's thoughts suddenly darted as the collie had darted , and stopped , and crouched , wonderingwhich way to go . Here was his opportunity to make up for the " lousy marriage " and the " deadness . " It was a great book , Dad . I mean , you know , not up there with the giants or anything , but a damn fine book ! " It was kind of awkward , " he said . " To discuss it ? " " Well  --  yes . " " Why so ? " " Because you 've never discussed that part of your life with me . What I mean is that  --  I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do you know what I mean ? " Lenny saw his father lower his head and smile . " I know what you mean , " his father said . " I am a little surprised . I would n't have thought that would make a difference . " " It does n't , really . Not to me . But I was n't sure whether it would to you or not . But I can tell you one thing  --  I would n't be passing that book around to my friends if I did n't respect it myself . " " I 'm sure , " said his father . " Does respect ' mean you liked it ? " " Yes , Dad , that 's just what it means , " Lenny said . " I thought it was a very well-written book . I got the feeling it was a very personalbook . " " Is that good or bad ? " " Are n't personal books supposed to be good ? "  | " That depends on whether you like personal books , " his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I like personal books . I would n't say it 's my favorite type of reading . I really do n't consider myself a good judge of fiction anymore . " " Really ? Why not ? You 're an English major , are n't you ? I seem to recall that you were interested in writing yourself at one time . Have you given that up ? " " Oh , God , yes ! " Lenny exclaimed . " I 'm no writer . I found that out quickly enough . I wrote a few short stories in my freshman year . They were awful . And besides , why would anybody want to add to everything that 's been written ! " " I quite agree , " his father murmured . Utterly hopeless ! Why could n't he say the right things ? Why , when he knew so fucking well what his father wanted to hear , could n't he say the right things ? Could it be that he wanted to hurt ? No , he did n't want to hurt . He did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took hold of him that he could n't control . His life , was all ! The life he had to rescue , or for all their intelligence and enlightenment and good will , they would pull him out of his orbit and into the great , selfless , gravitational drag of theirs ! It came to Lenny in a sudden sunburst of understanding : They clung to their lives no less desperately than he clung to his ! That made it fair ! He did n't have to struggle so with his conscience , feel so goddam guilty about the words that came to him naturally and honestly ! It was all fair ! They arrived at the highway , and in turning onto it Lenny gunned the car in tribute to the thing he had discovered . " How do you like the way it handles ? " asked his father . " Beautiful , " he said . " It 's yours , " his father said . " What ! " " Yes . I see now that you need a car here . Of course I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you come home for the holidaysyou can take the car back with you . "  | " Wow ! " Lenny breathed . " Too much ! What are the right words for that ? " " I 'll leave you to struggle with that , " said his father . " How about thanks ? " " That 'll do . " Lenny felt the pull , the great , selfless pull , but he remained steady , thinking : It 's fair , it 's fair , it 's all fair ! Lenny drove his father directly to the motel . He helped him pack his things and then carried the suitcase out and put it in the trunk of the car while his father went to the office to check out . He waited so long for his father that he was on the point of investigating the delay when his father finally came out of the office . Lenny had seated himself in the companion seat . His father got behind the wheel . " I 'll drive you over to your place now , " his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " After a few seconds , he added , " There was a message for me in the office . " " Oh ? " " Yes . It was from Kathy Willens . " " Kathy Willens ! " " Yes . She left a number to call , and I did . She asked if I would give her a lift to New York when I returned . Do you know of any reason why I should n't ? " " Me ? No . Hell , no . I mean , you know , if you 've got the room , and you do n't mind . " " I do n't mind . She asked that I meet her at a gas station just outside the south exit . Do you know where that is ? " " Yes . It 's about a half-mile down the road . I 'll show you . " When they came to the boardinghouse , his father drew up along the curb , letting the motor run . He said , " I ca n't predict what will happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know there 'll be no havoc about it . It 's difficult to know what is the right thing to do . Perhaps I should n't have said anything at all , but sooner or later you would have to know , and it seemed to mep107that this is the best place for you to sort out your feelings . I hope I was right . " " You were right , " Lenny said . " Ski , " his father advised . " Do whatever occupies you most pleasantly , even if you ca n't be completely happy . " Lenny nodded . Then he got out of the car and walked around to his father 's side . He gave his father the directions to get where Kathy Willens would be waiting for him . He put his hand out , and his father took it . His father said : " Whenever you feel like it , for whatever reason , phone me , phone your mother . And if you do talk to Mother , I think it would be foolish to pretend that nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lenny nodded , his gaze fixed on the library across the campus . He thought of Kathy accompanying his father , and a sudden fantasyflowered up in his mind . He killed it . There was a limit to absurdity . " Anyway , I 'll see you in a few weeks , " he said . " Right , " said his father . " Take care "  --  and drove away.  | " Dave ? " " Hello , Stan . " Stan is my brother , five years my junior . I loved him , too , when we were both younger , but I have n't understood him for so many years that my feelings toward him have become very confused . He has , incidentally , a deep , rich voice , bass-baritone , and I 'm sure that this accidental asset has done much to shape his life . This is the first time I 've heard from him since that late afternoon on the lawn . " How are you feeling ? " he asks . " Fine .

" " If you 'd rather not  --  " " I did n't say that . I said that  --  " " Mom is worried , " he says . " I see . " " Dave , I 'm sorry , deeply sorry , but I ca n't say I 'm surprised . " " Oh , really ? Why not ? "  | " Well  --  " His deprecating baritone with a dying fall , which I understandto mean that I should understand what he means , but I do n't . Truly I do n't .

" " You and Dodie , " he says . " You 've never really connected . " " Is that a fact ? How would you know ? " " Look , Dave , " my brother says hastily , placatingly , " the last thing in the world I want is to get into an argument with you . You did connect . All right ? I 'm calling you right now simply to say that I 'm sorry  --  and to ask if I can be of any help . I know how hurt you must be . But you know , Dave , there 's no point in taking it out on Mom . " " We wo n't argue , " I say to him . " Perhaps you know something I should know . Please believe me when I say that I 'm in the dark . How would you know that Dodie and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Tell me that ? No , of course not , Dave . " " Then how do you know ? " " How does one know something like that , " Stan says in that tone which has regrettably set us apart since my discovery of its permanence . It took some years . I was at least thirty before I accepted the reality of my younger brother 's nimbus-shaped election . One must go back to old religious paintings to find the like . That divine assurance . He goes on with his analysis : " You and Dodie operated on different levels , that 's all . " " Me ? " " Both of you . You and Dodie . This is not a moral judgment , Dave . There 's no right or wrong . It 's just a fact . " " And this is something you 've been able to determine in the three or four times we see each other in a year ?

With the exception of a single area , I have n't the faintest idea what their married life is like . I wonder why Stan has ideas about mine . " I do n't need Ilse 's concurrence , " he says . " It happens that she does , but  --  " " Stan , what the hell do you mean by operated on different levels ? ' That does n't mean a goddam thing to me . It 's just gibberish . If I 'm on the first floor and you 're on the second , then I can understand what you mean when you say we operate on different levels . Otherwise it 's just words .

For reasons I could never fathom , he became a junior sales executive in an insurance company on graduating college . In five years , he was top producer , specializing in estate planning . He made over forty thousand in one year . It was no miracle . Or if miracle , it had the right provenance for miracle . He carried the message of insurance like early Christians carried the faith . Clients were drawn into his charismatic field , resolving the mortal conditionwith premiums . They became his personal friends . Then , all of a sudden , he gave up insurance , became an enthusiast in the new wave of movies , took all his money and invested it along with two others in a string of art movie houses . In the suburbs . He 's thriving . I guess you have to admire him . " Look , Dave , " he says , " there 's nothing mysterious about it . You and Dodie are incompatible . Always have been . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Good Lord , man , I do n't know that , " I say . " I did n't know that . How are we incompatible ? " His words come in a mild , measured way . He does n't want to hurt . He 's applying healing truth like a poultice . " You and Dodie ,  |p114as  people , you simply did n't respond to the same things in the same way . Your reactions were always at a different intensity . " " And , " I return , " do you know of any two people in your wide circle of acquaintances who react to everything with identical intensities ? Do you and Ilse , for example ? " " There 's a critical point , " he says . ( Which is true . ) " Did she tell you this ? " I ask . " Who ? " " Dodie . " " Me ? No . " " What do you mean me no ' ?

What good would it do now to bring up the fact that my wife has always disliked my brother 's wife ; always , from their first encounter , Dodie disliked use with the unremitting aversion of one woman whose every sense was offended by the intensities of another . And yet it is just possible that Dodie would have phonedp115Ilse to tell her this very thing . Self-justification knows where it will find the warmest welcome : not where it has reason to hope for the greatest understanding but the greatest forgiveness . " What about Mom ? " I ask . " She says you have n't been in touch with her . " " Not true . I 've been in touch with her . " " You have n't been to the house . " " That 's true . " " Why punish her ? " " Was that her word  --  ' punish ' ? " " Do n't be paranoid , Dave . " " I 'll try not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in touch with Mom . Thanks for calling  --  " " Dave  --  " " Yes ? " " What 's with the hideout ? " he asks . " How long do you intend to stay out of touch ? " " I 'm not out of touch , Stan . Here we are talking , are we not ? Dad has been over to the apartment . I 've talked to Mom on the phone several times . Surely you can tell from talking to me that there 's nothing seriously wrong with me . We 'll get together and talk , as soon as I 'm in the mood . Frankly , Stan , I 'm depending on your understanding and forbearance . Yours particularly . I 'm doing whatever is needful to my days right now , to my condition , and my condition changes from day to day . You and Ilse apparently knew things that I did n't know . You must have been right . Events have proved you right . But , you see , what I 've got to do is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is n't easy . My old ego is a little too battered to handle the situation . Somehow I 've got to work a new one into existence out of the acceptances I can make . Do you see what I mean , Stan ? " " Absolutely , Dave , " Stan says . " Absolutely . " I 'm glad he does , because 1 do n't . I had no idea what I was going to say when I began that terribly sincere speech . I just wanted to terminate this talk without closing off this avenue of communication.  | " All right , then , " I say . " If you need anything  --  " he says . " Thanks , Stan . " " Take it easy . " " You bet . " I could have told him to go to hell , but that is n't the way I speak to my brother . But I do want him off my back at present . That 's why I handed him that bouquet of paper flowers . Ego and acceptances . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He and use . That 's the one thing I know about them , that passionate hobby of " studying " and " understanding " people . Stan does n't allow it to interfere with his sound business sense , nor does Use allow it to disturb the efficient running of her home , but after a day of profit and order they love to relax over cocktails and psychology . They 'll be talking about my surprising access of selfknowledgetonight . They 'll be happy about it . I do n't know why I 'm going on in this way . They 're not nearly as bad as I 'm making out . Five years separate Stan and me , but occasionally when some incident , odor , or pattern of clouds moves me to early tenderness , I am likely to confuse my brother with my son , saying one 's name when I mean the other . I ca n't bring myself to react to Stan purely on the basis of what he has become . I feel like it sometimes , seeing that selfhood , hearing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to allow for a final attitude . It will always be like that , I guess.  |p117I  must visit my parents . To delay any longer will change my mother'ssmoldering sense of exclusion to fright and self-pity , and I do n't think I could deal with that right now . As Stan said , why take it out on her ? I do n't want to take it out on her . Truthfully , I do n't want to take it out on anyone , and I know I must get rid of some of this venom if I am to go on living . I drive into Queens at about six in the evening . The traffic is heavy but not impossible . This is the first time I will be visiting Forest Hills in my new condition , and I realize that the reason I have n't done so before is not so much the ordeal of facing Lily Lang but the fear of establishing a new routine . Regular visits . Once or twice a week for dinner . After all , why not ? Lily is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partisanship ? One hundred per cent ! Which is precisely what I do n't want . Venom is what I must get rid of , and partisanship is the mud puddle into which I must n't sink . Although it was never likely that I would feel at home in the Forest Hills apartment . That apartment marks the postwar life of my parents , and that life no longer included me . Stan , yes , for a few more years , but I had flown the coop . Acts of God and wars are acceptable riders in the everlasting Jewish contract . The Forest Hills apartment is serene and full of the somber glints of polished mahogany . The upholstery bellies in smoothp118permanent pregnancy . There are no rough boys to disturb the medium-priced , Regency order fashioned out of Lily 's dream of style . But there were other rooms . There were rooms in Harlem that I barely remember . We lived in a brownstone near Mount Morris Park . Lower-middle-class class . The city 's ethnic trek was just about to begin . Even then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the marginal line . It 's strange . Despite his perpetual cry  --  " I only have two hands ! "  --  he was always able to meet his wife 's minimum requirements ( which were never at the level of self-denial ) and send two sons to college and maintain a gradual but constantly ascending life-style . He is a master craftsman , and that gets around after years of plying the needle , and there are always men willing to pay fancy prices to smooth out the sags and slants of their bodies . I should n't be surprised if Sam has socked away a nice figure against that dreaded day of retirement . By his own standards , he is a success . I was about seven or eight when we moved away from Harlem . What I took with me was the tower which stands atop a hill in Mount Morris Park . I 'm quite sure I could n't have conceived this notion while we still lived in view of the tower , but the sights , smells , and sounds of genesis were with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mine was the tower . It was later in life that I painted the tower gold . My notion was that if I ever climbed its metal staircase to the top , I would be able to see my future by gazing out on the wide street that debouched on another , nameless park that rolled on to a point in time and space whose juncture took the form of my destiny . And just by turning around in the tower and looking the other way , I could look into the dark mysteryof time before memory , the primal dust of all beginning . The tower  --  and the horrible opened-up man . I had nightmares . I think of them as nightmares , but more likely I could n't sleep , thinking of that cardboard display propped up in the window of a drugstore , the figure of a man opened up in a glossy , multicolored display of veins and arteries , liver and lungs , heart and entrails . All packed like the innards of a chicken that my mother wouldp119scoop out after splitting open one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and green . How could I be contained in  --  or contain  --  crayon colors and mere meat ! I cried and babbled about the man in the drugstore , and often at the dinner table ( I 've been told ) I would stare at the chicken meat or lamb chop , gagging , until I had to be taken away to the bathroom . Spirit and body . Everybody finds his symbols . I had mine . We moved north , scarcely two miles , but to me it was over the Himalayas , to the other side of the world . We moved to anotherapartment on another street , this one even more quiet . On the other side of the street was a cemetery . On the corner of the street was a slate-colored church full of spires and pigeon droppings . I had n't a friend in the world . It took me months to find one , and all through childhood , right into high school , into college , I 've never had much more than one at a time . I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's concern to case a neighborhood for their children 's social life . Survival beat too closely at their backs for such considerations . We lived on that wide , quiet street with the church on the corner , the Hudson River at its foot , and the Indian Museum midway between , until I went to college . I took my younger brother to that museum . We examined kayaks and tepees and breathed in the cloistered air . That was my odor of sanctity . I took my younger brother by the hand and we walked to Broadway for the Sunday paper . I played ball with him on the wide street beside the museum . I did n't think of myself as being lonely ; I thought that all people must make it in solitude until the time they found their ideal companion . That enforced sense of ideality took root early and grew like a tree  --  one solid , sequoia-high tree on an empty plain . OccasionallyI would find in school or on the streets one whom I hoped would be the ideal friend . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that friend to do nothing without me . I have no doubt that it was suffocating to be my friend . I learned in time that others had not cultivated the same sense of ideality that Ip120had . Somewhere in the process of learning this , I turned to books . I was a reader . I had found my vocation , my infinitely docile , infinitely varied friend . What I discovered in books was that my condition was not unique . What I also discovered was that there were injustices in the world . I embraced that discovery like a lover . It was the explanation of my life and its direction . There was injusticein the world ! I did n't want to march with anybody or put out a flag ; I wanted to read more books . In college , I found friends . Others who had a similar view of the world 's injustices . I was made to understand that injustice was not just a reflection of my life 's solitude but gaunt starvation and bloody murder . I joined parties . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world . But if the truth be known  --  and it had better be !  --  the world had merely taken knowable dimensions , and I was still looking for myself , self-revealed , on the other side . " One thing I do n't understand , " says my father . " What 's that ? " I ask . " Sam , " my mother interrupts him , " I thought you were going to bring in the ice cubes . I thought you were going to make David a drink . " " I wish , " my father says , " you would n't try to shut me up . " We are sitting in the living room of the apartment in Forest Hills . Lily is sitting in her armchair . Sam is sitting in his Barcalounger . Just sitting . His wife , my mother , does n't like my father to make full use of the Barcalounger in company . Even partial use . My father had had no passions in his life , but he has had some unshakable convictions . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He is the man for whom advertising claims are written . Another  --  late  --  conviction is in the life-giving propertiesof the Barcalounger . " What do n't you understand ? " I ask my father . " I do n't understand  --  what happened . With you and Duddy . " My mother looks at me darkly , This is as she had anticipated , and she blames me for having encouraged him . Her look tells mep121that this would be the inevitable outcome of allowing Sam Lang to ask questions . " What happened ? " I say . " I told you what happened . " " But I do n't understand , " he insists . My mother half-raises out of her chair . " I 'll get the ice cubes , " she declares . " Sit , " my father says , slapping the arms of the Barcalounger . " I 'll get them . " He gets out of the chair and goes to the kitchen . My mother looks at me and shakes her head . " David , David , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Barcalounger , I realize what a freak that thing is in Lily Lang 's living room . Among the tables and lamps and chairs and bric-a-brac  --  a delicately carved and formalsea  --  my father 's Barcalounger breaks the surface like the hump of a rising hippo . A misplaced monster . It is a tribute to the years that my mother has finally yielded and allows it to wallow there . She believes monarchically in female dominance in the home , but age and death are assaulting ; it is time to make concessions . " Have you heard anything ? " asks my mother . " From Dodie ? No . " She nods , sighs . She has grown old , the indomitable Lily . She has defeated everything but time . Each time I see her of late , I become more aware of this shrinkage , like an apple withering , but after a few minutes in her company my mind supplants the woman before me with another , one caught in ripe perfection  --  Lily at her best . But I suppose that image @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her withering . My father , coming in with a bucket of ice cubes , says , " You want a scotch and soda ? " " You sit down , Pa . I 'll make it . " My father resumes the Barcalounger and begins to tip back . To the degree that my father moves backward in his chair , my mother moves forward in hers . " Are you getting ready to lay there the whole evening ? " she asks.  | " Recline , " my father corrects , from the brochure that accompanied the Barcalounger . " Well , it 's not pleasant to talk to a person who looks like he 's waiting for an operation . " " Mom , stop it , will you ? " I say . " Let him relax . It 's only me in the house . " My father tips back in unexpected victory . " She does n't let you live , " he says . I go to the table containing the bottles and mix a drink for myself . " I do n't understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and looking at my mother . " Perhaps you can tell me . " Lily 's face sags in sourness , but her eyes ignite in cold fire . " You 're finally asking ? " she says . " Yes , I can tell you a few things . " " What can you tell me ? " " I can tell you I 'm not surprised , " my mother says . " You 're not the first not to be surprised , " I say . " Why are n't you surprised ? " " Because if a person has n't got a heart , then you can expect anything . That girl never had a heart ! " That is n't true , of course . Lily is not going to be a reliable witness , but then neither was I. It 's interesting to me , however , in just what way my mother is not going to be reliable . " What do you mean she never had a heart ? " I say . " It seems to me she was always nice to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tips forward a little . " This is not me talking , " he makes clear . " This is your mother talking , not me . " My mother looks at my father , looks at him reclining , all ease , while she sits forward in her chair rubbed raw with family misfortune . Lily has always been a master at creating these quick allegories . But I notice for the first time there 's a routine quality to the scene . A thousand such scenes dwindle recessively in my mind . Something has happened to my parents . It seems to me the hope of changing Sam has gone out of Lily , and the chafe of fearingLily has gone out of Sam . They have changed to accommodatep123each other , not out of human will but like rock and running water . Lily turns back to me . " It 's not a mother 's place to open her mouth , so I kept my mouth shut , " says Lily . " But now I can tell you . This girl never liked your family . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Is that plain enough ? And nasty ! Do you remember when I refurnished about eight years ago , she bought me a present ? A painting ? You remember ? Are you going to tell me that she did n't know I would n't put such a hideous thing on my wall ? That it was n't deliberate ? And the cousins ' club ? How many times I pleaded with that girl , please , Dodie , what would it harm ? No ! Never ! " " I had something to say about that , " I remind my mother . Lily shakes her head . " No , David , if a woman wants to preservefamily , she 'll do it . She had absolutely no feeling for your family ! " " Now listen  --  " says my father . " Yes ? " I say . Sam raises himself upright. "  --  I want you to know one thing , " he says . " I do n't care what anybody says . I like Duddy . I always liked Duddy . Every year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me up at my place of business to wish me a happy birthday . Heh ? You did n't know that ! I 'm telling you now you say she 's got no family feeling . I do n't say what she did was right , but do n't tell me no family feeling . Who else called me up at my place of business to wish me a happy birthday ? Who ? " My mother and I look at Sam Lang , silent in the image of Dodie'ssurprising communion with Sam Lang . Driving back to my apartment , I catch a glimpse of myself and Dodie in the long concealment of our marriage . She never told me about phoning my father on his birthday . That was her own thing . Why did she do it ? What turn of compassion or conscience made her do it ? I see Dodie shaking her head over some of my father'speculiar densities . I did n't think she thought of him much at all ; or if she did , then as an odd , stubborn life form , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him  --  perhaps even found affinities I could never imagine . And that print she bought for my mother eight years ago , was that deliberate or not ? I do n't know . It could very well have been . They did n't love each other , Dodie and Lily . They were women of strong preferences who let their preferences show . But I knew all that . My God , there was so much I knew and did n't know in our marriage ! I told Lily that I had heard nothing from Dodie , and that is true . Dodie is drawing away from me , assuming different proportionsin my mind . I have n't heard her voice since that day almost three weeks ago when I phoned her to say I would n't be coming home , that I had been in touch with Ralph Friedman and that I would be staying at his apartment . I had just returned from Vermont . " What about Lenny ? " she wanted to know . " I told him things were difficult between us , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " she asked . " Holidays . " " What am I supposed to do ? " " I do n't know , Dodie . Whatever you want . " " Can you give me an idea what your plans are ? " she asked . " No , I ca n't , I 'm afraid . I have no plans . " " It 's all up to me , is that it ? " " I would n't say that , " I said . " It 's up to me , too . That 's why I 'm staying away . We were n't getting anywhere . " " David  --  " " Yes ? " " I 'm seeing someone , " she said . " Besides Arthur ? " " A doctor . An analyst . " " Oh ? Why ? " " Why do you think ? " I was silent . She went on : " You know very well what you were doing . I wo n't be driven off the deep end , David . I 'm not the type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " All right , " she said . " I 'll need money . " " You have the passbook , " I told her . " It 's a joint account . Take whatever you need . " " I want you to know . It 's your money . I want your permission . " " Oh , for God 's sake ! You have it . " " Thank you . " " Take care of yourself , Dodie . " She did n't reply to that . I think she was crying . She hung up . Dodie was never much for tears , but just then I think she was crying . And when I questioned her during that ghastly period when we were both stretched on the give-it-a-chance rack . And once before that I clearly remember  --  when we first made love . That rounds it off neatly . No doubt there 've been other times , but these are the occasions which come to mind . I 've thought several times before to talk of our meeting , our courtship , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met ? Is it at all important how a man and woman meet ? We met . The first time at a house party given in honor of a Greek poet who had recently come to this country to do the lecture circuit . My novel had already been accepted for publication ; therefore I was on the fringes of the literary crowd . I was invited . I took the tall , slow-moving girl to be the mistress of the Greek poet . She seemed the one most solicitous of him . Several weeks later , by pure coincidence , I met the tall , slow-moving girl at a wedding in Manhattan  --  she a friend of the bride , I a friend of the groom . I told her what my imagination had made of her and the Greek poet  --  discreetly , of course . She laughed . She told me she worked for a man , Bernard Reinitz , who made his living importing European notables and booking tours for them . Her job was just about everything  --  secretary , hostess , tour director , and amateur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I-was-there survivorsout of a decade of nightmare . Other aspects of the job I learned later . Dodie with her tallness , her languor ( which I thought at the time affected ; it was n't , is n't ) , her interesting green eyes , her thickish nose ( which even then I did n't find unattractive )  --  all of the Dodie I held in my arms as we danced at the wedding of friends ( it was June ) was so devoid of the meaning it would have an hour hence , and for more than twenty years thereafter , thatp127I find in my memory of that distant Dodie the power of myth , which when touched restores to my senses the full flavor of the world and my life at that time . We danced . I held the flat of my hand against her back . She was very pliant , accommodating the movements of her body to the less than instinctive rhythms of my dancing style . She wore a perfumewhich lingers in my memory as fox-fur brown . I remember the imperturbability of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pose . I became curious about the pose , and because I became curiousabout the pose , and because of the long loose lines of her body , and because of the fragrance in my nostrils , my senses gave a turn and I was suddenly and completely open to this girl 's attractions . I accompanied Dodie to where she was then living with her parents on the West Side of Manhattan . I asked if we could see a play , a movie , a concert , whatever she liked . She liked all those things , but she could n't that week . Perhaps next ? Yes , next . And then there were many concerts and plays and movies . All considered , it was a rotten courtship , if joy is any measure . There was no joy . It started with Dodie 's famous confession that she had been in love  --  recently  --  perhaps was still in love , to be honest . Which did n't surprise me . She was twenty-three at the time . Girls of that age who had n't been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the complication was that the man she had been in love with  --  was possibly still in love with  --  was the man she worked for . Ah ! That was not so good . There 's nothing in human experience to indicate that the difficulties of courtship necessarily adumbrate the difficulties of marriage , but there , if I wanted a sign , was one . What was past could easily have been buried , but it was my fate to wrestle each day with a ghost that had had a good night 's rest ; a freshly shaven , vigorous , charming ghost . Bernard Reinitz . A male surely designed for conquest . Custom-cut hair with the right amount of gray in the right places , blue eyes , a virile face , German accent sauteed in British overtones . Herr Reinitz took the heart out of me by being , to top it all off , the genuine article . He spoke four languages . Everything about him gave evi/dente that his rescue of European talent was not just a business but a cause . He went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but demolished any hope of competition . But Bernard was married . He would never , he had made clear , divorce his wife . He was the one to end the affair with Dodie . He was honorable to boot . " Why do you go on working there ? " I had asked Dodie . " Why not ? " she had replied . " I could n't hope to find a more interesting job . Besides , he 's away much of the time . He travels to Europe quite often . I 'm left alone , which I prefer to a place full of people I do n't care for . " I could have quit then  --  perhaps should have . I had been given an early and unmistakable option to do so . And perhaps if I were at that point helplessly in love with Dodie , I might have done so . But I had the idea that it was still in my power to help myself . I lingered . There were the imperturbable jade eyes , the fox-fur brown scent , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold in the tower or cellar of her interior castle . Of course I did n't tell her that . It sounded ridiculous even to me , the fantasy I had woven about her , but in a rational part of my mind I had the feeling that it was true , or at least partially true . What was equally true and ridiculous were all the affinities I was fabricating between myself and the hidden Dodie . The tempo of our going together increased . I had n't begun to work on that second , failed , novel . I had taken a job with a national magazine , and I could afford all those plays and concerts and dinners and my own apartment , to which we went , often , for me to suffer the brutality of limited lovemaking . She would n't , she said , until she was sure . It was June when we met . Months later , on a day when a warm sun cracked the husk of winter in the city , we were together on one of our frequent lunch dates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she needed a new lipstick . We stepped inside , went to the cosmetic counter , where Dodie bought her lipstick . There was a mirror on the counter , one of those ruthless mirrors women can tolerate only when they 're alone and dealing with theirp129face a feature at a time . I observed Dodie staring at her reflection , and I too moved so that I could see her in the mirror , see what she saw , the thick volutes of her nose , the fullness of her mouth , and the eyes which gazed on these imperfections with such inveteratehatred that I felt a rent like the tearing of tissue . Then I found myself through the wall of Dodie 's castle and into the room where she spun not gold but grief . " You 're a handsome woman , " I said to her . " Men are supposed to be handsome , " she said , turning and walking toward the exit . I followed , saying , " Would you rather I had said pretty ? You 're not pretty . Pretty does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're all of a piece . You have your own style , and it 's a very attractive style . " " I wanted to be beautiful , " she said , with ancient antagonism . " I wanted to be a genius , " I said . I had trained myself in hidden affinities , and when they revealed themselves I had the right words . We walked out of the departmentstore and into sunshine that glinted blindingly off windows and metal trim . We had dinner that evening , and then went to my apartment . When I touched her , she began to cry . Whatever I had guessed about her , I had never imagined such a storm of tears . Her body shook , and though I comforted her I was not in turn comforted with the knowledge that tears were to be her signal of surrender . But it no longer mattered . Between the afternoon and the evening of that day , I had fallen in love . She occupied me as completely as a victorious army . I made love to Dodie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the salt of them on my tongue . We too were married in June.  |p130Our  marriage . Almost twenty-three years . What did we do ? I think now that I sold out to Ted Buchholz so that I could be free to ask myself this . I 've applied myself to this question most of the minutesof my freedom , but for some reason my mind has refused to handle it , has skittered here and there , disorganized , among a few hasty recollections , and like a confused dog has flopped flat , muzzle between paws , eyes closed . Do I really not remember ? No , I do remember . With diligence , I can reconstruct everything . We lived in the Chelsea section of the city . Dodie 's father , whose law practice was heavily in real estate , used his influence to find us an apartment when apartments were very scarce . The room I had been living in was very nice for a bachelor , but it was scarcely adequate for a married couple . Dodie continued to work , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naturally  --  but for some medical research bureau . I had quit the magazine to begin work on that second book . We had calculated our resources to give me a year . I wrote in a room with a window which afforded me a view of a comically tiny park surroundedon all sides by a brutal flow of traffic . I began this account with the statement that I was alone for the first time in my life . Well , I was alone then too , but now that I have both rooms in mind  --  this one and that other distant onep131I see the difference even more clearly . Never was Dodie more intensely with me as in those hours I spent alone in our first apartment . It was when we were apart that I most felt the newness and weight of her presence . I loved Dodie . Feared her , too , a little . I feared her past , so dense and unknown to me with a recent lover and old ambitions . But I was confident . I would become well known . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not too impossibly far , was a point where everything would converge . I would work very hard and become the best that I could be . Dodie and I would move out of our separatehistories into the one we would create together . And we would have a fine time in the creating . We had the means and the taste to enjoy this overloaded city . I thought we were lucky . We had honeymooned on Cape Ann because Dodie had been there before and had loved it . We stayed there for a week , grew bored , then drifted over to Cape Cod . I have color transparencies of those few weeks . They 're in the house in which I no longer live . I remember one particularly , a photo of Dodie standing before a fabulous junkyard operated by some bearded character who wore a green visor , dungarees , and who sat in a rocking chair amid his psychedelic rubbish . I remember a flamingo-colored commode , a pastel-blue automobile tire . .. . We lived in the Chelsea apartment for four years . Lenny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Long Island and moved away from the city . What did we do in those four years ? I wrote that first year , did not like what I had written , gave it up and went back to work for the magazine . Was it really as easy as that ? Was there no bitterness , no hurtful sense of loss in giving up an ambition ? I do n't know . At the time , I would have said no . Regret , surely , but not the acid defeat which might have corroded the next twenty years . That second book seemed like such an immense amount of work to say such a small thing . I knew then  --  as I know now  --  that real dedication survives the most meager returns , or no returns at all . But if I did n't have the dedication , I was n't going to pump it into myself . Also , I was a little afraid of the kind ofp132life that committed itself to goals it could n't reach . I think I was afraid of being nailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this in the beginning of that first year . I had worked assuredly on that second book through the molten end of summer , the freshness of fall , the first phlegms of winter . Dodie continued in her job . " Do you mind this ? " I asked . " What ? " " This setup . Your working , my staying at home . " " Not at all . Do n't make it sound as though you 're lazy or unemployed . You are working , you know . " " Yes , I know , but still you do n't have to do it . There 's enough money . You can quit . " " What would I do ? " she asked . " Whatever you wished . You have the city of dreams at your disposal . " " What are you saying , David ? What city of dreams ? Daylight dreams ? Would you want me hanging around while you work ? " " I would n't mind . " " I would , " she said . " And you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We both would have minded . Conscienceprompted those remarks . The man sitting at home , the woman leaving each morning . Some scared little immigrant ethic sat in a corner of my brain and looked at me moodily . But what I did I did because I liked doing it , not because of a bad conscience . Often I phoned Dodie during the day and arranged to take her to lunch . Often I would meet her at a bar near her office , and we would have a cocktail , and then dinner , and then a movie , or a play , or visit friends , or just to walk around a selected corner of the city and accumulate the odd purchases of pleasure that could be had from the sheer surfeit of places and people . We were living the New York life , Dodie and I , and I thought we loved it . I did . I thought Dodie did . I thought Dodie loved what I loved . Now that I 'm reconstructing so well , I remember something else . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before ,  |p133considering  the origin of all these musings . . . . It was winter , near Christmas , as I recall . I guess I must have phoned Dodie and arranged to meet her at the museum  --  the museum  --  the one in my daymare . I set out from the apartment sometime in the late morning . Snowflakes had already begun to fall when I entered the subwayon Twenty-third Street . When I emerged in the Fifties , it was a blizzard . Wind-driven snow whipped at my eyes as I came up the stairs , and I walked the short distance from the subway to the museum bent into the wind , looking up obliquely from time to time to place my progress and avoid crashing into some other blinded pedestrian . Judging myself to be near my destination , I looked up once more and saw Dodie looking at me from behind a plate glass window . It was the museum . She was waiting for me there , behind the window . I smiled , or waved , some sign to mark the comedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a foot away , stood dry , warm , and contemplative . She was that , all right  --  contemplative . She looked straight at me without a glimmer of recognition . We had lived together for half a year , had known each other a year before that , had passed hours and hours in each other 's company . In all that time I had never been able to judge how near or distant she may have been from me at any given moment . I doubt that more than five seconds passed between the meeting of our eyes and her return from whatever peak or plateau her reverie had taken her . But the distance ! That 's what I remember now , the distance . She recognized me at last , her eyes large in the wonderment of finding me all white and intrusive in the middle of her green landscape . Then she smiled and raised her eyebrows and motioned me  --  for God 's sake !  --  to get in out of that polar weather . In the few steps to the museum entrance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , indeed . I do n't recall that I was particularly alarmed by the discovery . I just remarked to myself that this was how far it was possible for Dodie to get from me ; that she was in all likelihood still inhabiting the world she knew before she met me , or perhaps the world she still projected despite me . And I was so respectful of the mind 's privacy that I stamped my shoes ,  |p134sla|p|ped  the snow from my coat , kissed my wife , and let the momentgo by . What did we do ? We went to movies and restaurants and museums and concertsand visited friends . And friends visited us . Dodie prepared fancy dishes  --  French , Italian , Mexican  --  and we drank wine and talked politics and art with our friends . Small groups because we lived in a small apartment . And after our friends were gone , we would open the windows to dispel the smoke . We cleaned the dishes and talked not of politics and art but of the lives of those friends with whom we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree of this or that one 's unhappiness . I do n't know , do other people do other things ? We had survived the war , and we were celebrating that . But Dodie  --  Dodie and me  --  what was our life like ? Our life was exactly as I describe it . We went to movies and plays and concerts and museums . We visited friends and friends visited us . Dodie had her job . I wrote . We made love . We agreed we did n't want a child yet . The next summer we went to Cape Ann again , not because we had enjoyed it on our honeymoon , even in retrospect , but because not to go would have been a negative admission of some sort . We walked on the wharves , looked into the shops where all sorts of overpriced kitsch was sold . Dodie loved to look . I had learned that about her , she loved to look . " Why ? " I asked her . " Do n't you ? " she returned . " A little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words to that effect . I must have pressed the point , because I remember her conveyingto me in one way or another that her fascination lay in the fact that all these things had been made by human hands . Countlessmillions of beautiful things fashioned by human hands . She imagined a single desire passing through generations and expressingitself in hands luckily blessed with the gift of talent . I had known before this that Dodie wished for such hands . But if shep135had had talent it would have shown itself before this , and therefore I let the moment go by . I did n't decide to give up my book so that I could be a partner in Dodie 's longing . I knew before Cape Ann that I was through with the thing I had been working on . My assurance had faltered halfway through the year , and by the time the trees in the tiny park were in dusty leaf I was certain it was n't going to work . But I had n't said anything to Dodie . Who wants to announce the waste of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that year , earned it , but still . . . Another thing : I was afraid of being diminished in Dodie 's eyes . I was afraid that an item in our unwritten marriage contract was the faint luster of my one accomplishment . I thought I would be removing a source of pride or replenishment from Dodie 's life . Toward the end of that vacation in Cape Ann , we sat in a restaurant and looked out over a placid inlet coppered by a lowering sun . " I 'm giving up the book , " I told Dodie . She looked at me doubtfully . " You 're not , " she said . " Yes , I am . It 's not worth going on with . It is n't that I have n't been able to say what I wanted to  --  I have  --  but I see now  --  have seen for weeks  --  that it 's too damn small . " " Wo n't you let me see it first ? " " If you wish , but it wo n't matter . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " What will you do ? " " Take a job . I 'm pretty sure the magazine will take me back . If not that one , then another . " Dodie nodded , looked out the window , brought her green gaze back to me . " I 'm sorry , " she said . She was , but I realized in that moment that she was n't losing anything . She was sorry for me , but my efforts in that year had not replenished her . Lenny was conceived a month later . We wanted it to happen , and it happened . I had no difficulty in finding a job . Without consultingeach other in any deliberate way , we both knew that we hadp136entered a new phase . I thought I sensed in Dodie a willingness to let go the history she had lived before me . The weight of her pregnancyseemed to settle her . The need for the restaurants and plays and museums and friends grew less , and because it did so I was able to judge how much these entertainments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hospital on the East Side . Lenny was born with difficulty . Things did not go well . There was hemorrhaging , and the doctor told me that an operation would be necessary . He was sorry , but there was no choice . All would be well in a matter of weeks , but unfortunately there would be no more children . My wife , he told me , had already given consent . I stayed in the hospital , in the visitors ' room , until a nurse came to tell me that the operation had been performed and that my wife was quite weak but that there was no great danger . She was under sedation . It would be best if I went home and got some sleep myself . So I went back to the apartment and slept for a few hours , waking at daybreak . I was certain that Dodie was dead , and the terror in me blanched the world to a bloodless white . I saw before me years of terrible alternatives , hired nurses , the strong swoop of my mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gathered in a crushing mass of love and regret . Unable to wait until I got to the hospital to learn all this , I phoned and was told that Mrs. Lang was resting comfortably , and yes , I could come anytime I wished . It was May , a morning irrigated in my memory by a city sanitationtruck sending up a spray of water and cigarette butts alongthe curb . The streets were shadow-blue beneath buildings that blocked a sun rising out of the rust and dust of Long Island City . My life had been restored . Color came back to the world . I was again confident  --  confident that it was not my destiny to suffer certain things . Dodie was in her room , and I was allowed to go right in . She was combed and perfumed , worn and awake , and she held out her hand to me . I took it and pressed it and bent to kiss her lips stilltainted with ether . When I moved away , I saw a look of selfhood and distance in her eyes . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let the moment go by.  |p137We  moved away from the city when Dodie , out with Lenny in the baby carriage one morning , saw a rat stroll along a building across the street and duck into a garage repair shop . We were going to move anyway . The city is no place to bring up a child . I know , thousands do , but either they ca n't help themselves , or they are even more obsessive than Dodie and me . We bought the house , performed the usual rites of innocence with agents and banks , moved in , and shortly became involved with the rites of transfer . Was it the ancient Hebrews who took with them into exile a handful of beloved soil ? Dodie and I took more than a handful . We brought the city with us . We brought whole suites from Bloomingdales , armchairs from B. Altman , lamps from Lexington Avenue , odd pieces from the Village . It seems to me now we consumed years getting settled in a house some fifteen miles from our uninhabitable Manhattan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , did we ever find an inexhaustible source of talk ! Tables , chairs , rugs , bookcases , phonographs , curtains , bed covers , paint , prints , floor lamps , table lamps . . . We plotted decoration as conspirators plot revolution . Having missed out on passion thus far in our lives , we found it in purchases . A curvilinear couch ( they were fashionable then ) or a straight one ? Dodie wanted the curvilinear . I did n't . She planned a whole room around a curvilinear couch . " Please , David . "  | " It 's only a fad , Dodie . You 'll get tired of it . " " Everything 's a fad . " " Six hundred bucks , Dodie ! " " Please ! " I wonder now whether I took such a hard line because I had such definite ideas , or because I was enjoying the contest . I do n't wonder , I know . I was enjoying it . I think we both were . We enacted a romance in furniture . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And there was Lenny . We were equally consumed with the one child we would have . I do n't remember exactly when it was , but somewhere between Lenny 's birth and kindergarten I decided that our one-child parenthood was a significant stroke of fate  --  a balancein nature to keep increase limited to existing capacities . Whatever Dodie and I had was not meant to be spread too thin . The house and Lenny . We were occupied . The pattern of our life was set . Visiting grandparents with Lenny . Saturday trips to the city to look at something advertised in the newspaper . The Central Park Zoo . Birthday parties . Christmas . The surprises of an unfolding life . It seemed that David Lang and the nation entered a halcyon time together . Entrenchment guarded by the Eisenhowergrin . Then Rich and I were sent on that cross-country trip gathering material for a major article on the " crisis in education . " Rich was then employed as one of the staff photographers on the magazine . I had worked with him before , knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We worked well together on that trip , and we learned from educators of the need of good educational film . I had some money . So did Rich . We decided to take the risk . But what does all this mean ? What does it explain ? It explains the passage of time . I keep asking myself what happened to time . This is what happened to time . Lenny was born . Dodie and I watched him grow with the usual fascination . Rich and I formed our own business . And somewhere in those years it must have become apparent to Dodie and me that the enchantmentof Lenny had ended and the relentless business of feedingp139his long life had begun . It would go on for years  --  eighteen , nineteen , twenty  --  who knew ? We would be irretrievably middle-aged by the time the incubation period was over . There was nothing to do about that . We both loved Lenny , would sacrifice anything for him , given a crisis . But there was no crisis . We merely lived . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had grown plump , and I saw her entering a phase of matronliness . I do n't remember what was the frequency of our lovemaking , or how satisfying it was . There could n't have been anything radically wrong . If there were , the fact of it would be scored somewhere on that smooth surface of time . Of course the wife of John F. Kennedy had nothing to do with it , but time has a way of conjoining private and public lives when memory starts groping . I never asked , " Does Jacqueline Kennedy have anything to do with this transformation ? "  --  and so I ca n't be absolutely sure . I do know that Dodie was full of admiration , and that the transformation was coincident with the admiration . Dodie at least ten pounds slimmer . Dodie in new hair styles . Dodie in new dresses . Dodie appearing out of a domestic chrysalis , opening wings marked with colors I could n't have imagined , ready to fly . " Why do n't we see people ? " she asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Once a month , if that . " " Then let 's see people . " So we began to see people again . Every Saturday night . We invited people to our house , and we were invited in return . We found a reliable baby-sitter . We went to plays . We went to art exhibits at the Metropolitan , the Modern , the Huntington Hartford , the Guggenheim , not to mention the private galleries as plentiful as candied fruit in the enormous art-cake offered by the city . Desire breeds companions . Women , it seems to me , can do this better than men  --  find friends to meet the needs of their lives . Or is it just me who still clings to some idea of perfection in friendship ? Left to myself , I doubt I could have gathered the circle ofp140people Dodie did . She never hesitated to invite some interesting man , woman , or married couple we might meet for the first time at somebody 's Saturday night party . At times I was annoyed . " But we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What do you mean do n't know them ' ? We talked for hours at the Engles ' . " " I know , but is n't that a sort of secondhand acquaintance ? I mean , how do you know they 'll like us ? " Dodie had  --  has  --  why should I assume she 's changed ?  --  has a way of slowing up in conflict . Her speech begins to drawl . She picks her words more carefully . Even her body slouches more than usual , and sitting ( she was usually sitting when we argued ) she would become annoyingly languid . " I do n't know , " she answered . " But if they 'd rather not know us , they can always say no . " " Yes , I suppose so , but it seems kind of eager to be running after people that way . Why not wait ? Why not have them call you first ? " " Oh , my God , David ! How absurd ! " " Why ? Why is it absurd ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man is absurd . " No doubt she was right . I can see that her way of looking at things was more mature . I guess I could see it even then , but how surprised and secretly angry I was that she did n't guess at a reluctance that had nothing to do with ego , childish or otherwise . Dodie had chosen a direction for our lives , and she had n't consultedme at all about my willingness to go along . It 's true that my interests were more or less in the direction Dodie was going , but there was something in that social-art frenzy that I did n't like  --  a kind of new idolatry ; a special , New York idolatry , where the circle of devotion was so vast and varied that starting points would seem new by the time one completed the round . But if I did n't want that , then what did I want ? I do n't know . I only knew what I did n't want . I did n't want the plays . I began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that I had quit writing myself ? Perhaps , a little , and that little may have deepened and accelerated my reac/tion , but the plays , not my envy , were the wormy apples of discord . How stupid they were ! Oh , not all , I suppose , but certainly enough for the feeling to grow in me that I had signed on for a perpetual tour of lurid exhibitionism , the kind of exhibitionism displayed behind those plate glass-front whorehouses in old Berlinwhere erotic fancies paraded body-warm and dream-costumed . Devoid of meaning . Hysterical rages and perversions dressed up to pass for ideas and emotions . I remember an evening when after one such play we had gone for a drink at some bar  --  another couple , Dodie , me . It was the three of them against me . They had liked the play , defended it . I hated it , execrated it . The other chap  --  his name was Lester , I recall  --  LesterPickering  --  we never saw the Pickerings again after that evening  --  anyway , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the play but that he did n't have to understand the play to enjoy it . I laughed and shook my head sarcastically . I said I did n't believe it . He said it was quite true ; things not understood could be enjoyed . I said it was a pathetic self-deception , the very thing these frauds depended on . What was that , Lester wanted to know  --  what was it these frauds depended on ? I said they depended on the general human knuckleheadedness that equates obscuritywith meaning . Lester tipped his knuckle head , raised his eyebrows . Lester 's wife looked at her watch . Later , in the car , Dodie and I had a fight . I supposed aloud that I should n't have said what I said , but I could n't see why I had to sit still for that kind of idiocy . We were both smoking , I recall . We both flicked our ashes furiously at the ashtray protruding out of the dashboard like a malicious tongue . I remember that particularly , how our arms went out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in a very real sense Lester 's remarks were just as insulting to me . It was insulting to expect me to accept his brainlessness . " I happened to have enjoyed it , too , " Dodie said , slowly , distantly . " Oh , come off it , Dodie , you did not . " Silence.  | " You feel you should have enjoyed it , but do n't fall into the LesterPickering trap of believing you did . " Silence . " If you did enjoy it , then there must have been a reason . You must have understood something I did n't . Would you mind telling me what that was ? " Silence . " Dodie , for Christ sake , do n't sit there pretending that there are some things which are just beyond words , that there are some things which ca n't be explained to hopeless fools like me . I understandwords , Dodie ! I even write them ! And that play was nothing but words ! There was nothing going on beyond my powers of comprehension . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No ! Nothing ! " Silence . " Explain it to me ! " I challenged her . Silence . " Goddamit , Dodie , explain it to me if you 're so fucking hip to the scene . Explain this esoteric shit to me . Do n't let me flounder in ignorance my whole life ! " " David , either you stop shouting at me or stop this car and let me get out . " I wonder why I was so angry . Why so angry ? I think I was so angry because I feared that there was indeed something I did n't understand . Not the plays . The plays were mindless . Or were they ? Was it only to my mind that they seemed mindless ? Is there a way of being that is completely unlike my own ? Is there a world of sensibilityI have n't even approached ? Do things appear to other people in a different light ? Oh , I recognized what was happening , but I assumed it to be the kind of difficulty that naturally comes to people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing up . Dodie and I were growing older . But I still looked for convergence somewhere in time . I mean , how many things can one person be in a lifetime ? How many things can one person do ? When does experiment endp143and being begin ? I had been through a Depression and a war . I had done my share in building a business . I enjoyed good music and good books . I loved my son and my wife . I mean I loved Dodie , despite the difficulty that had crept into our lives . Christ , I do n't know what sex is supposed to be ! What women want it to be ! I hate this D. H. Lawrence crap ! God made men and women as he made them , and I was n't going to be crippledby the cult of male inadequacy . " Is it a matter of time ? " I asked Dodie . " What do you mean ? " " That it 's over too quickly , that 's what I mean . " " Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did I say anything was wrong ? " she asked . " Yes . Not in words . You know very well what I mean . Is it supposed to take hours ? Do you want me to do tricks ? " " David , please , do n't be ridiculous . " " Then what ? " " Nothing . " " Dodie , what is it ? " " It has nothing to do with our bodies , " she said , softly , distantly . I took her words to mean that I was performing well but that sex was n't everything . Indeed not . I knew that . There was conflict . We seemed to want the same things in different ways . A question of degree , no more than that . In time there would be convergence . But it had nothing to do with our bodies . Other needs required adjustment . If there had to be a disarrangement in our lives , this was the one my pride preferred . We had planted a Japanese cherry tree some years after we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the garage drivewayas one faces the house . In ten years it has grown almost as high as the house itself . For a few weeks in spring , it puts forth blossoms so lavishly pink that sometimes I have felt embarrassmentwalking out on bright mornings and seeing that naked sensu/ousness sunning itself on a suburban street . And on springtime nights , when Dodie and I  --  or sometimes Dodie and I and Lenny ( for I seem to connect the fullness of the tree with the fullness of Lenny 's adolescence )  --  would return from a visit , the headlights of the car would flood into the blossoms and expose that palpitantcolor concealed in the darkness . Seeing the Japanese cherry tree during the weeks of its efflorescence clogged my throat with repletion and joy . It was my talisman . It promised me forgiveness and renewal . Sometimes , when I would walk out of the house on my way to the morning train , I would call " Hey ! " to Dodie , and she would join me on the doorstep to look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was three years ago  --  yes , three  --  a bad time  --  everything and everybody had become an occasion for argument  --  that Dodie refused to come to the door one morning when I called her . " The tree , " I said . " Yes , I know , " she said from the house , not advancing . " It 's lovely . " " Do n't you want to look ? " I asked . " I 'll look later , " she said . We had had people over the night before , friends gathered from the professions , business , advertising , art . There was the usual talk of politics and art , and then the small , select exchanges among those who have tested each other in areas of true interests and concerns . The women who wished to talk about their children . The men who wished to talk about new accounts and old grievances . All very familiar , very harmless , and for me , that evening , very deadly . What happened was that it came to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't love these people . But not at all . And I was sure that they did n't love me , because I was usually the odd man out when these little pairings off took place . I guess I never did have the patience , or the sympathy , to make myself a partner in these intimacies . When it happened on that night , I did whatp145I customarily did : made myself useful . I gathered the loaded ashtraysand the empty glasses and carried them to the kitchen . There 's a small radio in the kitchen , and I often turn it on in the morning to hear the latest catastrophes , or , if that is too disheartening , to listen to music . I switched on the radio that evening as I rinsed glasses . A contralto voice throbbed out the last notes of something very beautiful . " Shit ! " I whispered regretfully to myself . " What ? " Dodie had entered the kitchen . " I could have been listening to that , " I said softly , trying to blur my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and took out the coffee percolator , which she began to fill with water . When it was filled , she spoke without looking at me : " Do you know that you are your father all over again ? " " Come off it , " I laughed . " Completely and utterly your father , " she emphasized , " and you do n't begin to have his reasons for being that way . " The next morning she would not come to look at the blossoms  --  or any morning after that.  |p146Kathy  wears her black dancing outfit and improvises to Berlioz ' Symphonie Fantastique . Gray imprints of dust patch her behind and knees . I can see that she is not familiar with the music , and her eyes have the frantic concentration of a little girl trying to keep up in a game which is proving a little too fast and tricky for her . The musical ideas run ahead of her . I feel as though I 'm watching a film in which the sound track is out of timing . Now she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other leg stretched out , head bowed , right hand grasping her right ankle , a pose expressingthe inexpressible  --  a mother 's grief , the sack of cities . But the music has bounded away , and Kathy is on her feet with a jump , a two-footed thump upon the floor . The people below will be up any second crying havoc ! It is muscularly clear to me that Kathy is not ashamed of her body . I hear the voice of some other blackgarmentedfemale saying , " Now the first thing you must learn is not to be ashamed of your body . " Kathy has learned the first thing well . She strains for positions , putting her Maillol-proportioned limbs at the service of some fugitive choreographic idea . Her face is beaded with sweat . Her mouth is open and her nostrils flare as she noisily sucks for air . Occasionally she breaks wind . No matter . She is not ashamed of her body . She is dancing . " Hah-h-h-h ! " she wheezes , lying cruciform on the floor , rib cage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . " Will you make a career of dancing ? " I ask . " No . " " Why not ? " " I 'm not good enough . " " You look good enough . You love it . " " That does n't make me good enough , " she says , getting up from the floor and going to the bathroom to shower . She decides to shampoo while she is up and doing , and after her shampoo she spreads a towel across her shoulders and arrangesher hair over the towel like fibers let to dry in some old handcraft process . Now she sits opposite me in her Empire robe , damp and glistening , eating fried eggs and ham and canned asparagus . She sits with her usual orthopedic perfection . " What are you thinking ? " I ask . She glances at me , shaking her head . " Nothing , " she says . " Kathy . " I can see she is remembering her promise . " What I was thinking ? " she muses . " I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A kid in school . An absolute nut . He could n't sit still a minute . Always had his hand up . He had an opinion on everything  --  buteverything ! Not that he was stupid , he was n't , but one time "  --  Kathy lowers her head and giggles into her hands  --  " I remember one time  --  it was in American Lit  --  we were discussing The Portrait of a Lady  --  by Henry James  --  you know ?  --  and suddenlyChris burst out "  --  and here Kathy 's voice goes surprisingly into a higher register  --  " The trouble with the goddam book is that it is n't only Ralph Touchett who has n't got any goddam balls , nobody in the book 's got any goddam balls ! "  --  and with the last word Kathy lifts her head , holds her hands prayer fashion in front of her , and lets herself go in the pure ringing abandon of one still near enough to childhood to retain the full virulence of laughter . " Did you like this boy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lowers her hands . " Sort of , " she says . " Hep148did n't mean anything to me one way or the other , but I sort of liked him . " " Did you find him attractive ? " " God , no ! He was tall and skinny . He had a face like a hatchet . " " Then you can like boys you do n't find especially attractive ? " She looks at me in a dilation of wonder . " Of course I can ! " sheexclaims . " What do you think I am ? " After a pause , she adds , " Ica n't imagine him in bed , though . He 's a friend of Brian . " " Who 's Brian ? " " Brian 's the boy I told you about . The one who lives in the Village . Brian Miller . I was thinking about how Brian and Chris used to sit around on the floor in Brian 's room and drink beer  --  " " Where ? " " In school . " " Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what ? " " Not you sitting on the floor and drinking beer ? " " Oh , yes . Me too . Sometimes . " " Go on . " " I was unhappy then , " she says. asWhy ? " . " Because I was no more to Brian than Chris was . It seemed to me he would just as soon be with Chris as with me . I always wondered why . I even thought sometimes that they might be making out , but I know there 's nothing faggy about either one of them . It was n't that Brian did n't enjoy it with me . He did . We used to fuck in his room , and it was wonderful . I mean for him too ! I could tell . Chris could never do that for him . Why would he want to be with Chris as much as with me ? That 's why I was thinking about Chris when you asked me  --  and then I thought about that time in the classroom . " " Was there something in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I ask . " Sort of , " she says . " But I do n't think I could explain it . " " Try . " She is silent for several seconds , her bare feet propped on thep149crossbar of the chair , performing a dreamy simulacrum of her three-phase exercise . She says at last , " I do n't know , thinking of Chris waving his arms and stammering , I realized you could n't make up enthusiasm you did n't feel . No matter how much you wanted to . Even if your life depended on it , I guess . Brian and Chris used to sit around and talk books until the words were like taffy in my brain . Did you ever see one of those taffy machines ? You know , one of those "  --  she extends the forefingers of each hand and rotates them round each other in an eccentric motion  --  " bars that turn and turn , pulling the taffy . My father once took us to Atlantic City when he was attending a doctors ' convention . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , " I say . " You were telling me about Brian and Chris . " " So what of it ? " she snaps vexedly . " I mean , you said I should tell you whatever was on my mind . " " That 's true , " I say . " I 'm sorry . Are you thinking of your father in Atlantic City right now ? " She shrugs . " Not really . I thought of him because of the taffy . " " I see , " I say . " Go ahead . " She looks at me sullenly . " Go ahead where ? About Brian and Chris ? The taffy ? My father ? " " Whatever you 're thinking . " " I 'm not thinking anything right now . Frankly , I think this is dumb . " " Then that 's what you 're thinking , " I say . " Why is it dumb ? " " Because the mind does n't stay on one thing , " she answers . " The second you start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " That 's quite true , " I admit . " But one of those thoughts made you angry . Which one ? " " I do n't know . You made me angry , asking all those questions . You know , you 're not a psychoanalyst . . . . All right , I 'm sorry , I promised . What do you want to know now ? " " Nothing except what you 're thinking . Whose image do you have in mind now ? " " Brian 's . " " Do you love him ? "  | " I do n't know . I used to . I used to be terribly in love with him . But he wo n't let himself be loved . " " That 's never stopped anyone from loving , " I say . " How wo n't he let himself be loved ? " " How ? You do n't really expect me to answer that , do you ? He just wo n't , that 's all ! By looking at me , that 's how . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had something tremendous on his mind , and he 'd just love to tell somebody about it  --  but not me ! " " Do you think you 'd understand if he did tell you ? " I ask . " Oh , Christ , yes ! " she cries in exasperation . " I 'd understand . It is n't all that "  --  she compresses her lips , looks for the word , finds it  --  " recondite ! In fact , I always understood what he and Chris were talking about . It 's just that it got so boring ! They 'd go on and on about Fitzgerald and Faulkner and Hemingway and Andersonand Sartre , and I would understand every fucking word , so help me , but it got so unbearably boring ! " " Kathy , for God 's sake , why would you want to stay if you were so bored ? " She shrugs . " Why , Kathy ? " " Why do you think ? " she replies at last . " Because of Brian . " " Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he bores you ? " " He does n't bore me . " " But you just said he does . He and Chris . Talking . " " The talking bores me . Brian does n't . " " That 's a very curious distinction , " I say . " I do n't understand it . It would seem to me that if Brian 's talking bores you , then Brian bores you . " " That 's how much you know . " " Tell me what you know . " " Oh , really , David , please ! Do n't be dense ! What does one thing have to do with the other ? " I look at her , not smiling , not frowning , just waiting . Kathy broods on my density for a time . Then she begins to make the distinction for me : " He has gray hair , " she says . " You know , prematuregray . Not much , just a little . And sort of gray eyes . He cutsp151his hair short . He 's not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful smile I 've ever seen on a man . " She pauses , gazing at the topography of her love . " Perfect teeth . " She plants the heels of her hands on the sides of her chair and rocks back and forth . " Then why are you staying here ? " I ask her . " Brian shacks up with other girls , " she answers promptly , her voice going flat . " I know he does . It does n't mean anything to him , so why should it mean anything to me . There were other boys before Brian , I can assure you . I mean , I know I 'm going to get married someday , and it probably wo n't be to Brian , and in the meantime I 'm physically mature , have been for years . I know , you 're shocked . I 'm sorry , David , but that 's your hangup , not mine . Oh , I do n't go to bed with everybody I happen to like . Do n't get that idea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are  --  well , there 's no reason not to . Besides  --  " " Besides what ? " She tips her head , looks arch . " I was kind of curious about you . " " In Vermont ? " " Before that . " " Before ? " A retrospective smile touches Kathy 's lips . Suddenly I am made to feel the wealth of concealment this talk , or months of talk , will never touch . " Lenny used to be in on those book-yak sessions , " she tells me . " Brian borrowed your book from Lenny . He liked it . Brian did . Maybe I should n't tell you this , but Brian and Lenny had a sort of argument about the book . Lenny  --  " " I 'm familiar with my son 's views , " I say quickly . The smile remains on Kathy 's lips . " Brian would like you to read his novel , " she says . I get up from the table and go into the kitchen for the coffeepot . I pour coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I sit down again . " I 'm flattered , " I say , " but I do n't think I 'd want to pass judgmenton Brian 's novel . "  |p152She  shrugs . " That 's okay with me , " she declares , waving one hand indifferently . " That 's strictly your business . " " Yes , " I say . " Tell me more about your father . " Kathy snaps her head away from the question . " I do n't want to tell you more about my father , if you do n't mind . " " Why not ? " " Because I 'm tired , that 's why , " she replies , her words heavy with hostile energy . " If you want to go on with this sort of thing , you 'll have to put a time limit on it . " " All right , " I say . " That ends the session for today . Shall we say fifteen minutes in the future ? Unless , of course , you feel like going on . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you mind if I put on some music ? " Kathy drinks her coffee . Her hair falls forward . She hooks a moist mass over each ear . " It does n't look to me that you have that much to do , " she says . " I do n't , " I readily agree . " I have literally nothing to do , except think about my life and make love to you . " " I do n't see that it would be such an awful imposition , " she persists . " No imposition at all , if I wanted to . But I do n't . " " Wo n't you even consider it ? " " I do n't know , Kathy , do you think I should consider it ? Do you want me to read it ? " " I think you could at least consider it , " is all I can wring from her . " All right . I 'll consider it . "  |p153That  novel . Mine . About London in wartime . The fact is I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but somewhere in the writing ( which means somewhere in my recollection of that time , because I actually began the novel at the war 's end , in Germany , while awaiting redeployment , and finished it during my first six months of civilian life ) I realized that the true source of feeling was not love and the nightmare of wrecked cities but war and the fantasy of myself walking London streets in daylight or in the blue terror of searchlights . I was in love with London , and when I began to write I transposed that love into a girl by the name of Blanche  --  which , incidentally , was not the name of the Canadian Air Force girl mentioned by Bob Rohrmoser , or the name of the actual girl used in my story . I do n't know why I feel reticent about names and identities at this point in time and distance , but I do . At any rate , the girl , the real girl , the one who became Blanche in the story , lived in a little cellar room off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was not in love with her , but I did take her places  --  movies , restaurants , bars , even concerts . She was a plain girl with fair , frizzy hair , and a childish inability to pronounce her " l 's " : " I 'm code . Please cuddoo me . " She worked as a clerk in one of the ministries . The pay was a joke . The first time she asked me to pay the rent was when she had bought several " frocks " in order top154look nice for the nice occasions when we went to movies or a restaurant . I was glad to pay the rent , because I felt so sorry for her . And I was happy that she was happy about the movies and the restaurants and the nights we spent in her icy room feeding life into the gas ring with shillings . But , as I say , the true love was born of the fantasy of myself walking along the Serpentine , having a pint of ale at Verrey 's , standing on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conquerors had come a thousand years ago . I drew that girl into the love , and I began to re-create it a little later with differentnames for the people and different directions for the love . This is a digression , I know , but it 's a needed digression . And perhaps it is n't a digression at all . At first I did n't know why I thought of war and London and the girl after the telephone call I just received , but perhaps I do now . The war , myself in London , that too was both fantastic and inevitable , given the world of those years . Similarly , I knew that the drift of these days could n't go on indefinitely . I 've been more or less waiting for the hard , eventful bend that would signify a change . And now here it was  --  the telephone call from Arthur Gerson . Even as he identified himself  --  " Hello , David . How are you ? This is Arthur "  --  I felt a strong need to understand certain things about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of the war , my novel , the girl on Baker Street , all the astonishing things that had become part of my history . I do n't know if this has ever happened to you . It has to me , several times in my life . I mean the crisis occasions when the instinctschoose among themselves which shall predominate  --  panic or calm , fear or courage , murk or lucidity . When Arthur announcedhimself to me , I experienced a reaction which hitherto I had thought confined solely to books : " flesh crawled " . . . " hair bristled . " The sensation centered around the nape of my neck . A swarm of dormant nits seemed to have become activated by his voice . " So there you are , " I said.  | " I 'd like to talk to you , David , " he said . " Will you let me talk to you ? " " How did you know where to find me ? " I asked . " Dodie , " he said . " Did she want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this your own idea ? " " I do n't know , " he replied . " Let me think . Does it matter ? Look , David , I 'm not representing Dodie , if that 's what you 're thinking . There 's a lot of nonsense going on , and I do think it 's time we all cut our losses . Could we meet and talk about this ? " " Talk about what ? " " I suppose you know that Lenny is not coming home the first week of Christmas ? " " Is n't he ? No , I did n't know that . How the hell do you know it ? " " Dodie told me . The last time she spoke to Lenny , he told her he would stay in Vermont during the first week of his Christmas holiday . He said  --  " " If you do n't mind , I 'd rather not discuss Lenny with you . Do you mind ? " " All right , " said Arthur . " But would you want to discuss other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " You would want that ? " I asked . " You would want us to get together ? " " I would . I think it 's time we all cut our losses . " " Yes , you said that before . Of course there 've been losses beforenow . Considerable , from my point of view . I wonder why it is that now is the time for all of us to cut our losses ? Has the distribution of losses shifted or something ? " A slight intake of breath at the other end . He said , " I do n't think sarcasm is going to be helpful in this situation . I do n't blame you for being sore , but under the circumstances sarcasm is silly and futile . Frankly , David , I did n't think that cruelty was your bag . " I spaced out the seconds before answering , fighting down what had to be fought down . " When would it be convenient for you ? " 1 asked . " I was going to get in touch with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I agree that it 's time we all cut our losses . Would tomorrow do ? " " Well , I 'm  --  All right , I 'll make the time . " " Where ? " I asked . " Your office ? " He hesitated . " Would n't you rather have lunch somewhere ? " " I 'd just as soon meet at your office , if that 's all right . " " All right . Twelve thirty ? Most of the people here will be out to lunch . " " Fine . Twelve thirty . Your office . " Several days after I had returned from Vermont , I phoned Lenny to tell him that I had taken up temporary quarters away from home . I gave him the address and the telephone number . Since that time , I have n't heard from him , and for the first time in my life , or his , I did not succumb to impulse and phone again . Since he was  --  oh , what ?  --  fourteen ?  --  fifteen ?  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right occasion to see if so many years of investment could produce some return . Naturally , I have no idea how many times Dodie might have phoned Lenny , or he her . Possibly there has been daily communication . Possibly Dodie has been carrying on her own negotiations at a furious rate , and Lenny has been waiting to hear what counterproposals I have to make . These are mere figures of speech , of course . Anyway , these things have been present in my mind for the past few weeks . The fact is I have no counterproposals to make . I would have waited indefinitelyfor Lenny to phone me , but now I must phone him . I did so . He was not in his room . I left a message with Bob Rohrmoserfor Lenny to phone me at whatever hour he returned . Kathy returns to the apartment at about ten thirty in the evening . She says hello , removes her mottled coat , hangs it away , walks directly into the kitchen and pours herself a glass of milk . She saunters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sling armchair . I am sitting on the chrome-and-foam sofa . God knows what she does with her time , although her large face looks ruddy enough . Has she been in touch with her parents ? Her aunt ? Howp157long does she intend to go on this way ? Will she go back to school after the Christmas holidays ? Is she taking drugs ? She looks sullen , unhappy . I know nothing about her . " What 's up , Kathy ? " I ask . She regards me with her large , hazel eyes . The sclerae have a bluish tinge . Perhaps it 's her eye shadow that makes them appearthat way . Health and anomie . Is it a habit of mind which makes me ask continually what is to become of her , what she intendsto do with her life ? " Brian asked if he could meet you sometime , " she says . " Would you want me to meet him ? " I ask . " Why ask me ? " she says , twitching one shoulder violently . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? You would n't be obliging me . " " I thought I would be , " I say . " I told you before , Kathy , that I was n't the least minded to oblige Brian . I do n't know him , and I have a feeling it would be best if we left it that way . " " Then okay , " she says . " Then I guess you better not . " " Then I guess I wo n't . " " What the hell 's turned you off tonight ? " she wants to know , looking at me sourly . I regard Kathy silently , thinking of the inflated verbal currency she uses , they all use : " turned off " . . . " turned on " . . . " thing " . . . " bag . " They have to shop in the same marketplace I do for the multitude of life 's needs , and this vernacular play-money will never cover their expenses . New currency is printed all the time , and those left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've not been " turned off . " I 've been " turned on . " Not in the way she means , however . My nerves are humming . By tomorrow afternoon , I may be a murderer . " I take it you had a fight with Brian , " I say . Kathy sits down on the floor yogi-fashion , looking into the cat'scradleformed by her legs . Her hair falls forward . All this drapery and mysticism . No , I wo n't be a murderer . I 'm not the murdering type . But what shall I do between now and noon tomorrow ? I refuse to spend all those hours devising a gesture . It 's too humiliat/ing . I must depend on some instinctive action when the moment arrives . But I 'm not good at instinctive actions . I 've always covereduncomfortable moments with smiles and patter and a vague general dismissal of the absurdity of crisis . That part of my life is over , however . I 've come to understand that crisis is crisis , necessaryconfrontation , not to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She says , " Do you believe that anybody , a man , can love everybody he comes into contact with , indiscriminately , male or female , everybody ? " " I do n't . Does Brian ? " " You should see her ! " Kathy seethes . " The latest creep they 've got hanging around . She looks like a pigeon with eyeglasses ! I swear ! A dead-white pigeon with big , pink eyeglasses ! Can you picture it ? She 's a poet . She 's had a poem published . In a real magazine . That makes her the most interesting female sincesince  --  JaneAusten ! " " What are you thinking , Kathy ? " I ask . Again she gazes downward , the foliage falling forward . " It 's confused , " she says . " I was thinking that if you read Brian 's book , then  --  " " Yes ? " " I do n't know . . . . I 'd love to see his face when you tell him it stinks . " " Have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Does it stink ? " " I do n't know . Sometimes I think it 's good , sometimes I think it 's awful . " " Depending on how you feel about him ? " " Yes , " she nods , emphatically . " Yes ! I 'm not kidding . When I hate Brian , I hate his stupid book . I think it 's stupid , pretentious , and a bore ! I mean , juvenile ! " " And when you 're loving Brian ? " " Then I love his book . Then I see it as a way of telling the truth . I  --  " The phone rang.  | " That could be Lenny , " I say , going to the phone . But it is n't Lenny . It 's Rich . " Where the hell are you ? " he asks . " Right here , Rich . How are you ? " " There 's mail for you here , " he says . " I keep telling Mary to hold on to it , expecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to discuss with you . I do n't like this disappearing act . I 've had requests from any number of people who want you to do freelanceassignments . Are you interested ? " " No , Rich . Not now . " " Why have you disappeared ? " " I have n't disappeared , as you see , hear . I 'm just doing a little hibernating . How are things going ? How are you getting along with Ted ? " Rich disregards that . He says , " Dave , we 're going to make a lot of money here . You should n't have bugged out , you shmuck . You could have been a rich man . " " It does n't matter , Rich , but from habit I feel jealous . I 'm glad it 's going well . " " Listen , " Rich says , " do you still have little Miss Hot-Box with you ? " " Yes . " " Why do n't you bring her over to the house Saturday night ? We 're having some people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rich  --  " " What ? " " I 'm seeing Arthur Gerson tomorrow . " A few seconds of silent thoughtfulness . My mind does a quick sketch while I 'm waiting : Arthur Gerson 's bare chest with a pipette sticking out of it . Beneath is a large , gem-encrusted goblet receivingthe blood . " Where are you going to see him ? " Rich finally asks . " His office . " " Do n't be an asshole , " Rich warns . " Slug him in his office and you 're cooked . You 'll be giving Dodie all the ammunition . " " No heart 's blood ? " I ask.  | " The time is long past , " he correctly points out . " Dave , be-have . " " You know me , " I say . " What are you seeing him for anyway ? " " He thinks we ought to cut our losses . " " Jesus ! Do you want me to go with you ? If I hit him , it 's simple assault . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know the outcome of this meeting . I think it 's important to my future . " " Okay . How about Saturday ? " I put my hand over the mouthpiece . " Kathy , " I say , " would you care to visit some friends with me on Saturday ? " She shakes her head . " Ca n't . Not Saturday . " I remove my hand . " Mind if I come alone ? " " Of course not . " Lenny 's call came after midnight . I had stretched out on the sofa , a funnel of light from the pole lamp directed on last week 's Sunday supplement , which lay like a large marker between consciousnessand the dream that had been waiting for me on the other side of the page I had been reading . The ring of the telephoneincorporated itself into the dream in a heartbreaking way that I could n't recall . " I have a long-distance call for David Lang . " " This is he , " I say , overwhelmed by a sudden flood of love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself , separated as we all were by petulance and pride . " Hello , " comes Lenny 's voice  --  and everything is re-established , all the secrets of personal history that can not be undone . " Lenny . How are you ? " " Fine . Bob gave me your message  --  " " Yes . I phoned . I understand you 're not coming home for the holidays . " " Who said that ? Just the first week . I have almost three weeks . It 's the first week I wo n't be home . "  | " That 's what I meant , " I say . " Under the circumstances , do n't you think you should come home as soon as you can ? " " If you think so . " " Do n't you ? " " Mother did n't ask me to . " " Did you phone her ? " " She phoned me . " " Have you phoned her since I saw you up there ? " " But , Dad , she 's called me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't call you . Therefore the silence . " Silence . " Lenny  --  " " I was n't sure you wanted me to phone you , " he says . " Oh , come off it ! You 'll have to think of something better than that ! What manner of reasoning would make you come to such a conclusion ? Have I ever not wanted you to phone me in the past ? " " Look , if you 'd rather I came right home  --  " " I want an answer , Lenny . I do n't understand your attitude . All these advanced views you pretend to have , but when you 're faced with a situation calling for a little understanding , a little maturity , you draw into yourself like a sulky animal . " " I did n't want to be a go-between , " he says . " Go-between ! What the hell are you saying ? Were you ever put in such a position before ? " " Christ , yes ! Not directly , but  --  you know you have , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know nothing of the sort , but suddenly I am cold and cautious . Apparently there 's no limit to the things I do n't  --  or did n't  --  know . But I have begun to learn how to hunt in this wilderness . " What did you plan to do that week  --  ski ? " I ask . " Yes , " he says , his voice brightening considerably . " I 'm just about at that point where I can really ski . There 's a guy up here , sort of a semipro , Lars Schreiber , and he 's been giving me some pointers . If I skied steady for that week , I 'd really be over the hump . " " And Mother has no objection to your staying ? "  | " She did n't say anything . " " Then stay . " " I got my marks , " he says . " Two A 's ' and three B 's : " " That 's fine . How will you be coming home ? " " By bus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , phone me beforehand , let me know what time you 'll be arriving . I 'll pick you up at the terminal . " " Okay . " " Take care , " I say . " Right . See you , Dad . " Kathy , whom I thought asleep , is sitting up in bed , enfolding her legs with her arms . It seems to me there was a girl in my dream who had done just that very thing . " I hope , " she says in a drowsy voice , " I just hope that if I ever have kids , I 'll never forget that they have eyes and ears . "  |p163Morning  . Another bright day . I started out much too early , telling Kathy I had business to attend to . She stood at the bathroom door combing her hair straight down on either side of a plumb-line part . I found South Sea island connotations in her hair , her nudity , her facial bone structure . Were I less preoccupied I would have asked her what she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the usual operations of involvement . I could see myself taking Kathy in my arms and making a plea for understanding and forgiveness . I could see us venturing out as lovers , making an odyssey of the city , telling each other the selectedfables of our lives . But I will be forty-eight not too far into the new year . I am capable of only so much self-delusion . I have embarked on a serious project . I left Kathy her weekly twenty and walked out of the apartment . Into a crisp , clear day . It 's only ten o'clock . What shall I do with the hours ? I begin to walk south , toward Columbus Circle , then east along Fifty-ninth Street to Fifth Avenue , then south on Fifth Avenue , where the shops are dressed for Christmas . There was a time when I loved the shops at Christmas . Now I feel nothing . They are not vulgar , as so many claim . I think they are done in good taste , but like almost everything else these days they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hands of fashion , and it strikes me that history will note this as one of the prevailingp164modes when something comes to an end . I do n't know exactly what . Civilization ? Maybe . Not the world . Lenny said that nothingis the end of the world , and he 's quite right . My mood , however , is shot with lurid flashes of finality . The man I was would not have been the one for this coming interview , but the transitionalman I think of myself as being as decreed that this interviewshall take place . Am I kidding myself about the transitional man ? But look at how unlike myself I 've been . Look at all the harsh things I 've done . It was I who left my  --  our  --  house . Look at the way I 've handled my father , my mother , my brother , Kathy , Dodie , even Lenny . . . . I 'm as far as Rockefeller Center in my southbound stroll . I did love this city at one time . I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size and inhuman variety can be the metaphor of human longing while that longing is still young and undefined ; but when one knows what one is , what one can do , then the city no longer substitutes for the dream . The dream is defined , and one can pass through these looming streets and never once look up from that small , personal definition . Twenty-three years ago , almost , Dodie and I stepped through the doors of that department store across the street after I had seen the annihilating look she had given herself in the mirror of the cosmetic counter . The sun was glinting off the metal trim of windows , as it is doing now . . . . The arcade of Rockefeller Centeris jubilant with white , wire-wound figures playing bent fiddles . Beyond is the resplendent Christmas tree whose dimensions would have been the pride of the city , when the city took pride in anything . Inside , the rink and the skaters . I walk inside and look at the skaters . There 's an Oriental gentleman on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can scarcely skate , much less figureskate , but clearly his heart is full of graceful swoops and pirouettes , which he executes with his hands , his hands only , while his awkward skates wobble gracelessly here and there . Two girls on my right squeal their mirth into their covering hands : " Look , look , he 's gerna do it again ! 0 , my God , look at that ! Look at those hands ! I 'm gerna die ! It 's just too much ! . . . " It'sp165now eleven o'clock . The Oriental gentleman at last falls on his prat , his hands still performing sinuous prayers . I leave the arcade and continue my way downtown . At Forty-second Street I turn west and start toward the Seventh Avenue leg of my journey . A crosstown wind blows into my face . Once , on the last day of a dissolving friendship , I sat in that desperatelittle park across the street with my friend and listened to him recite in a monotone a story of such long and bizarre strife that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was talking about were Phil , himself , and Amy , his wife . The nature of that strife stunned me . Nine years and three children too late , she , the wife , hungered for nighttime streets , lean young men , beginnings , Bohemia . But even more stunning was the role I had unknowingly played during all those years . His wife would have been content , my friend informed me , if he were like me . Me ! That is what she had told him , countless times , if he were like me a little , if he had brought into their lives some air of former freedom , wit , imagination  --  who knows ? . . . " Anyway , Dave , that 's the way it 's been . I know it 's not your fault , but I have to be truthfuland tell you that your existence has crapped on my life . It 's an accident . I admit it . Like a couple of cars skidding . But I ca n't be friends with the other driver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dodie , but for Christ sake stay the hell away from me ! Maybe ten years from now , but right now forget it ! " It 's been more than ten years , Phil , but I think you 'd still be interested to learn what has become of wit and imagination . Ten years is too high a price to pay for a little irony , but you might like to tell Amy , if she 's still your wife , that nothing works forever . And I do remember  --  now that every square of paving in the city is determined to contribute its mnemonic bit  --  that Dodie was neither surprised nor depressed at the fate of Phil and Amy . Yes , she could see Amy 's point about Phil . Phil was a bore  --  well , not exactly a bore , but a man who had settled like a house on its foundations , all cracks showing . Of course I could n't see . I was Phil 's friend . I did n't eat and sleep and everything with Phil . All I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clutch of re/membered hikes across the George Washington Bridge , Boy Scout packs on our backs , to build a fire and roast hot dogs somewhere on the Jersey Palisades . .. . It is now eleven thirty . I have been walking very slowly , stoppingat the display windows of Army and Navy stores , beneath the marquees of movie houses where the faces of girls in black panties are blocked out , like secret agents who risk their lives for our security . All that walking and all that thinking , and I am no nearer the word , the gesture . . . all right , then , this is what I will not do : I will not shake hands with him . That civilized I am not . And I will not sit down in the brown leather chair of his . I will just stand and look at him . Not a word . He must utter the first word . . . . Down these steps  --  buy a token . . . . Have you got the first word , Arthur ? . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must get off the next station and phone him . I must tell him not to wait for me . I must tell him that I will not subject myself to the sight of his sickening mug . . . . I will do nothing of the sort . I will stay on this train and do what I must . Chambers Street . I walk the few blocks to the inescapable building  --  and push the elevator button for the twentieth floor  --  ( you see , Arthur , I do remember )  --  and I am almost there  --  and here is the door : " Hillsborn , Gabriel and Gerson "  --  and this is surely the first crisis of my new life . . . . Well , then , what ? What do I truly think , and what do I truly feel ? No more digressions , no more retrospections . Just what do I truly think and feel ? I truly think that I must truly think of what I truly think , or I shall go down to a dreadful defeat . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife , Dodie , did not wish and bring about . I think that in this time of enlightenment and free choice , Gerson owes me nothing but a decent regret for unhappy consequences . I think I can not hate Arthur Gerson for having done what Dodie found most acceptable . I think that now I must enter this place . . . . " That you , David ? Be with you in a moment " . . . and discover that while I must not hate Arthur Gerson for what he has done , I ca n't help hating him for having thought whatp167he thought while he was doing it ! Yes ! I can hate him for that ! Thank God , I can hate him for that ! " Well , David  --  " His hand out . Fair hair . Fair skin . Shell-frame eyeglasses . A little brown mole on his right eyelid , which I had forgotten . There is no consciousnessin raising my arm , but like witnessing my own dream I witnessthe raising of my arm , and see myself swing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my hand on Arthur 's face , and see the shell-frame eyeglasses fly to the wall and fall . A full heart . A full , humiliating slap . As I had intended . As I had from the first intended . And there is Arthur , who has said , " Ooo ! " with his hand to the left side of his face , where I have hurt him frankly and considerablyand intentionally . I feel shriven.  | " Are you satisfied ? " he says . " Somewhat . " " I can crucify you . " " No witnesses . " " I do n't need any . " " Yes , you do . " " Oh , shut up ! I was wearing glasses , you fool ! " " I was aware of that . " He has the glasses now , examines them . They 're not broken . Tactilely it was everything I could have wished for , but to all my other senses it was an insulated experience . The wall from which Arthur 's glasses rebounded is a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree . The office settee on which they fell is another foam job , covered with royal blue fabric . The carpet to which the glasses then fell is a deep pile , sort of a tweed weave . Arthur has a handkerchief to his face . He puts his eyeglasses in his breast pocket , then looks at his handkerchief after dabbing it to the corner of his left eye . No blood . The light in this anteroom is not very good , what with these handsome somber surfaces , but I think I can make out a raw pink blossoming in the pale flesh . " Well , " he says , " are you going to finish the job ? " " I 'm finished , " I say . " Unless you 'd like to continue . " " You know , I am going to press charges against you , " he says ,  |p169his  light eyes unintimidated . His eyes are tawny . So is his hair . I see that he has gone in for the long sideburns . He comes toward me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have never assumedbefore : David Lang , boxer . But Arthur has something else in mind . He stomps past me , rips open the door of the office , charges out . My posture disintegrates . Arthur returns in less than a minute , accompanied by an alarmed-looking gentleman with a friar 's tonsure and a little potbelly . " Mr. James , " Arthur says , " I want you to witness this scene . This man , David Lang , has just now struck me in the face . I was wearing my glasses . Would you please look at my face . Does it appear to you that I 've just been struck ? " " I would say  --  " begins Mr. James , but Arthur quickly takes over again . " Do you admit striking me in the face ? " Arthur asks me . " I admit it , " I say . " Thank you very much , Mr. James , " Arthur says to his neighbor , shaking his hand . Mr. James nods , looks at me , departs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corner of his left eye . SuddenlyI feel the need of legal advice . " Can I go to jail for that ? " I ask . " You 're damn right you can ! And I 'll see to it that you do ! " What I have in mind is to go at him with both fists , thinking of sheeps and lambs ; but though I detest him no less now than I did before ( more , in fact , principally for his not having lost his selfpossession ) , I find that I have lost all desire to hit him . I wanted to satisfy myself , not destroy him , and I 've done that . I 'm quite satisfied with what I 've done , but I do n't want to go to jail for it , or even be sued and have this particular period of my life taken up with a lot of legal nonsense . I know lawyers . And accountants . And insurance men . Not only will I be asked how much all of this is worth to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to figure it out . I do n't want to spend my time in that way . " You had your goddam nerve , asking me up here , " I say . " What do you think I 'm made of ? "  | " I do n't know what you 're made of , and I do n't give a damn , " Arthur replies . " You can get the hell out of here now . " " You wanted to talk to me , " I remind him . " Are you out of your mind ! You come up here and hit me in the face , and then you carry on as though nothing has happened . " He regards me with genuine curiosity . He says , " I did n't know whether to believe some of the things Dodie told me about you , but I see now that she knew what she was talking about . " His mention of Dodie 's name sends a needful rush of chemistrythrough my veins . Adrenaline . Lye . Nitroglycerin . All passages are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in six directions . I choose what looks like a promising one . " Does Rita know about you and Dodie ? " I ask . Arthur finally puts away his blasted handkerchief and takes his glasses from his breast pocket . He puts them on and points to them . " Am I safe in doing this ? " he asks . " Or do you think you might have another Neanderthal fit ? " " You can drop that shit , " I tell him . " I asked you a question . You do n't even have to answer it . Rita does n't know , does she ? That 's one of the losses we 're supposed to cut . Shall we sit down ? " " Let 's go in my office , " Arthur says . We do . I 've been in his office before , so I know where to look for the items I 'm now free to despise with all my heart . Being an activist , Arthur keeps himself surrounded with active art and memorabilia . Goya and Daimler prints , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in labor , civil rights , etc . Damn him , anyway ! He makes me distrust my own inclinations . Off to one side , Arthur has the usual leather-bound volumes on1 the law , but more prominently displayed are the many shelves of protest literature . Commercial books in their dust jackets . So what 's wrong with that ? Nothing 's wrong with that . Bravo ! Exceptthat I do n't like people who wear their slogans too obviously . Keep Christ in Christmas . As if anyone keeps anyone from keeping his personal Christ in Christmas . And who 's preventing Arthurfrom being engaged with his engagements ? My prize emeticp171is that collage  --  the first thing you see on entering  --  the one made of newspaper clippings and a meshed set of gears in the center . I know I 'm describing this in the most invidious way possible , and that 's deliberate enough , but even without my special effects I believe this office carries its own distinctive cachet of offensiveness . Dodie ! This ! Arthur sits down at his desk . The lighting is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the pink-and-white schematic of my hand on Arthur 's face . " Are you going to remain standing ? " he asks . " Sit down . No , Rita does n't know . If you 're planning to say anything to her , I wish you 'd let me know . " " Why the hell should I ? Did you give me any advance notice of your plans ? " " Do n't be ridiculous . I did n't have any plans . " " Like hell you did n't . " He looks at me quizzically . Clearly Arthur has been told something . I remember the dream of that afternoon in late October . What astonishes me is not the prophetic power of the dream but the miraculous chain of events that followed . The dream , after all , told me nothing about that . The dream itself was rejected by my terrified soul as an evil visitation , not to be accepted even in the helplessness of my dream , and by now it has become a little pocket of the past , warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since then has danced with fantasy . " Look , " Arthur says , " I do n't know what Dodie has told you  --  " " That 's rough , " I say . " But it does make things a little more even . " " I 'm going to be absolutely truthful , David . " " You 'd better be , since I happen to know the truth . " Arthur shakes his head . He swivels his chair around , looking out the window to his right . Eyeglass , eye mole , my hand upon his face . Several times he has twitched his cheek . I hit him hard . The sensation of it lies curled in the palm of my hand like a bristly little animal . He 's angry now . It would n't do to push Arthur too far . He 's neither a coward nor a fool.  | " We 've known each other for over three years , " he says . " Dodieand I were attracted to each other almost immediately , but we did nothing about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that visiting back and forth , if you recall . " " I recall . " " This despite the fact that you and Dodie had n't had a decent relationship in over ten years . " " Who says ? " He removes his gaze from the window and turns it to me . " Did you ? " " I 'm asking the questions ! " " Who do you think says ? " he replies . " Dodie . " " What did she say ? " " Do n't be ridiculous . You do n't really expect me to tell you , do you ? " " I do ! " " And if I wo n't ? " " I 'll be on a phone talking to Rita within five minutes . " Arthur swivels to the front of the desk . He slaps his hands down on the desk . " You can do as you goddam please ! " he says , lookingme straight in the eye . " I 've had it with you . " He points . " There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get up . I begin to get up , too . Maybe he 's not entirelywrong in his interpretation of my movement . He seizes a triangular brass ruler on his desk . " You come near me , you sonofabitch , and I 'll split your skull ! " he says , and I think means . " Sit down , " I say . " Get out ! " he yells . I sit down . " Arthur , sit down , " I say , my voice quiet , controlled . " Why should n't you want to tell me ? " " Because it 's none of your business , " he says , sitting down and chucking the ruler on the desk . " Whose business is it but mine ? " " Do n't pretend that you do n't know , " he says . " People generallyknow that much about their lives . "  | " I do n't know , " I insist . " It 's not true that we did n't have a decentrelationship . I do n't think it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must know her reasons for saying it . " " Why do n't you ask her ? " " We 're not in touch , as you very well know . Besides , I do n't think she 'd tell me . " " Well , that would be her prerogative , " Arthur says , sensing the shift in power . " Whatever she said , " I ask , " did you believe it ? Really ? " " Of course . " " Then tell me . " " Why should I ? " " Because I loved Dodie very much , and when I found out about you and her I suffered the very old death of having rocks piled on me until I was crushed . You say that people know that much about their lives , whether they had a decent relationship or not  --  and maybe you 're right  --  but the fact is that I thought Dodie and I did . If we did not , did not to the extent that all this would seem to indicate , did not for as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't , then I must be told the truth . " " Why did you hit me ? " Arthur asks . " Because of the things you thought when you were making love to my wife , " I tell him promptly . " How would you know what I thought ? " " Because I 'm human . " " I did n't think of you at all . " " If you did n't know me , I 'd believe that , " I say . " But you did know me , and you thought of me , and you pitied me , and you rationalized me , and you derived an added spice because of all of it , and I would ask you as one who has been hurt considerably more than you to please drop this now and tell me what Dodie told you about our relationship . " Oh , he is going to tell me the truth now ! The decks of his realisticconscience have been cleared , and he is going to let me have it broadside ! " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dodie told me thatp174you deliberately and systematically undermined her individuality , her quality as a woman , a human being . You were n't crude or obvious , but over the years you took away everything that gave her pleasure . By a long , subtle system of disparagement , you destroyed everything she wanted or enjoyed . " " Why are you telling me this , you lying bastard ! " I shout , utterlyastonished . " Because you asked . " " I thought you would tell me the truth ! " " I am telling you the truth . " " No , you 're not ! You 're making this up ! Dodie could n't have told you any such thing ! There is n't a word of truth in any of it . " " Oh , is there not ? Naturally , you would think it 's a lie . I did n't imagine it was possible , but I guess you have n't the slightest conceptionwhat you were doing all those years . " " Is this Dodie 's way of getting back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Arthur asks , watching me closely . " Never mind . Tell me  --  what long , subtle system of disparagement ? Was she by any chance explicit ? " " The art lessons , " he says . " What about them ? " " You made her give them up . " " Then it 's simply a matter of lies , " I sigh . " Ordinary , gardenvarietylies . " " Are you denying that you said to her that the world is full of mediocrities ? " " Did I say that ? Yes , I said that . After she herself admitted that  --  she said that she realized  --  the context in which  --  " " And the courses at N.Y.U. ? " " She was bored ! Did she not tell you , as she told me on countlessoccasions , that she was bored ? " " You mocked her friends . " " What friends ? Her friends were my friends . You , for dirty , treacherous example ! " " Books , " he says . " Books ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading detective stories . " " Snide comments ! I simply said  --  when she asked  --  " " And you refused to share her enthusiasms . That kind of childishperversity . Just because she would like a thing , you would n't . " " Oh , you could n't have made this up ! " " And you were selfish . " " Selfish ? How ? " " I can better tell you where . " " Where ? " " In bed . " I am on my feet , and Arthur is on his feet , and he has the brass ruler in his hand again , but I have no intention of attacking him . This interview is over . " Put your mind at ease , " I say to him . " You 've cut your losses . " I walk out  --  out  --  and go down twenty floors  --  and walk out  --  out into the bright day.  |p176This  city ! It 's unbelievable ! Savages ! Cannibals ! The first two telephonebooths had " Out of Service " labels pasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone hanging at the end of the cord like a lynched rat . The next one had the coin box gutted and the dial mechanism twisted off . I could go to my old office , Rich 's new enterprise , which is n't far , but I 'd rather not . I do n't want to talk to anyone but the one I want to talk to . There . There 's another booth . Five will get you ten  --  ten ?  --  a hundred !  --  a thousand !  --  sure enough !  --  look at that !  --  mouthpiece gone , earpiece gone ! I tell you , I was in London during the war , the world was coming to an end in thunder and flame  --  Armageddon !  --  and the phone booths in the streets were in working order . I tell you , I do n't remember a single one marked with the lyrics of a sex maniac 's lullaby , much less this naked evidence of mechanical rape . This , mind you , in a city at war , blacked out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far from here . Sid Simon , my tennis partner , the odd extra , the figure who figured least to figure . I 'm sure by this time that Sid Simon has learned or guessed at fishy doings at 2045 Garfield Terrace . " Been away on a trip , Lang ? " " Yes , indeed , a bad one , as they say . " . . . C No more booths ? Where , then ? I must make a telephone call . I 'm only two blocks away from my old building . Dare I risk ? There are phone booths in the lobby . And it 's lunchtime now  --  executive lunchtime  --  chances are Rich and Ted Buchholz are out to lunch.  |p177It  's very likely , however , that I 'd bump into someone . Abe Brenner , for sure , living his death in a busy marble tomb . . . " I could better tell you where ! " . . . That is a lie , Dodie ! How dared you discuss such things with him ! You have put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did I ever do to make you hate me so ? I did nothing  --  nothing ! Books ? Dear God , books ! What unmitigated crap ! As if I ever gave a good goddam if you read Agatha Christie or whomever you liked ! Once you asked me , and I said that detective stories did n't interest me . That 's all ! Can you deny that ? . . . There 's another booth . . . . And the art business ! And the school business ! I had no intention of speaking to you , Dodie , but now I must . Either you have gone insane over a long , subtle period of time , or I have . . . . My God , will you look at that ! The whole front torn off ! . . . Is Genghis Khan occupying this city ? Why this savagery ? Why this insane anger ? Any moment I expect a horde to come round the corner , torches guttering . . . . Speaking of anger , who just hit whom in the face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are n't there other reasons ? Yes , yes , no doubt , but if you do n't mind I have neither the time nor the inclinationfor large social questions right now ! Abe Brenner is missing . In his place is a stolid , shapeless woman wearing the same buff-colored jacket over a heavy knit sweater . So the time has come , has it ? Coins . I need a dime . I do n't have a dime . . . . " May I have a pack of Marlboros ? " " The soft or the hard ? " " The what ?  --  oh , the box , please  --  thank you . Are you Mrs. Brenner ? " " Yes ? " " And Abe ? " " You know Abe ? " " Yes , I worked here  --  " " Abe is laying already . " " Oh  --  I 'm sorry . " " In the hospital , " she says . " The doctors want to torture himp178a little more . He 's finished , but the doctors want to torture him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When you see him will you give him the regards of David Lang ? " " Thanks . I heard your name . Abe says you 're a nice man . I 'll give him your regards . " " Please do . I 'll hope for the best . " " The best is the end . " " Ah , well . . . Goodbye , Mrs. Brenner . " She nods . Abe Brenner says I 'm a nice man . In crossing the lobby to the phone booths , it occurs to me that never once in all the years that I traded with the now finished Abe Brenner did I ever give a thought to what he thought of me . Here and there , lying in odd corners of the city , like scraps of torn newspaper carrying out-ofdatehistory , there must be fragments of opinion on David Lang . Someday , when I have the time , it would be interesting . . . These old-fashioned booths in building lobbies are safe from vandals . My heart is jumping again . Why do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead . What will I say ? I 'll think of it when I have to . How strange ! I have n't dialed the old number in so many weeks . I tell you  --  it 's almost  --  I 'm so flooded with past telephone calls arranging this restaurant and that movie , this appointment and that cancellation , this avoidance and that obligation  --  I tell you that this finger poised over that circle points to me at the bottom of a roiling river where I am bumped , scraped , flopped , and raked over the rocks of years . . . . Never mind ! Dial ! I dial . One  --  two  --  three . . . the telephone company advises at least five rings . . . four  --  five  --  and one for good measure . Not at home . Well , why should she be ? Why , after all , should she be at home ?  |p181She  heard the phone in the house as she crossed the lawn on her way to the front door . She would never reach it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a drunken key while the house-gagged telephone implored again and again . . . four . . . five . . . and stopped just as she managed to get the key inserted . Once she had tried to convince Lenny ( whom she suspected at the time of being in love ) that those determined to reach you would eventually reach you , but she was no more persuaded by that kind of logic than he was . The unreachable phone call is the message one has waited for all one 's life . Dodie Lang could no longer imagine the contents of such a message . Who could say what to her that would make the difference ? There were those she wished to hear from , but they were the ones she could be sure would call again . The dream of the fabulous legacy did n't end with the end of possibility but with the end of desire . She did n't think of sudden fortunes , because sudden fortuneswere not what she wanted most . She did n't think of a single , special voice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magic could make everything else disappear . Still , she was annoyed . Uncaughtcalls made her even more jumpy than she was . There were many possibilities out there , and every one of them fraught with difficulties . Dodie pulled off her gloves , set her bag on the dining roomp182table , removed her coat , and then went into the kitchen , where she prepared a cup of coffee . She glanced at the kitchen clock . It was almost three thirty . She was tired and irritable . At this hour anybodymight have called . Lenny . Arthur . Jean . Even use , with whom she had made an astonishing entente . Even David , from whom she had heard nothing  --  day after day after day . It was n't that she wanted to hear from him particularly but that it was so mysteriouslyand aggravatingly unlike him to have withdrawn so completely . It nagged at her with the persistence of a mouse 's scratch or a faucet 's drip , his silence . It spoke to her of a resourcefulness she had n't suspected . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and still frightened her , and had no right to appear in her life after almost twenty-three years of marriage . She poured boiling water into the cup containing the coffee powder , stirred , sipped . . . . And Dr. Nathanson ( from whom she had just come ) had done nothing to dispel the mysteries and uncertainties . He smiled  --  no , he did n't smile  --  she had thought it was a smile , but time proved it to be simply the way his face arranged itself  --  he looked at her and nodded and waited for her explanation . . . . " Is telepathy , mind reading , something of that sort possible , Dr. Nathanson ? " " It all depends on what you mean . " " I do n't mean a thing other than what I said . I mean that phenomenonpeople call mental telepathy or mind reading . " " Have you had such an experience ? " " Yes  --  no  --  my husband has . So it seems . Dr. Nathanson , why ca n't you answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I ca n't answer you simply , Mrs. Lang , because there is no simpleanswer . I ca n't say with absolute certainty that it does n't exist . Some people claim that it does . " Ilse and Stan had recommended Dr. Nathanson . A personal friend . " He 's such a warm human being . " Stan had discovered him some years ago when he was making the switch from insurance to the movie business . A period of near-paralyzing anxiety . Whichp183was an astonishing bit of news to Dodie . She could n't have imaginedthis frailty in her brother-in-law , and it was probably this more than anything else that had established the late-found friendlinessbetween herself and that branch of the Lang family . They were friendly , use and Stan . And understanding . And very helpful . It was they who had made the contact for her . If only Dr. Nathanson 's face were not so Jewish ! Those thick lips . That nose ! It was a pudding of a face , a nice , kindly pudding of a face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to another human being because of his face , but what could she do ? You could n't will those things . If faces were a big thing with her , then they were , and she was sure that Dr. Nathanson would be the first to encourage her to admit it . After all , her own face . . . But about the mind-reading bit , he could n't say . The best she could get out of him was that between people who know each other well it was always possible to have identical memories stimulated simultaneously . " Could I have talked in my sleep ? " " Has anybody ever told you that you talked in your sleep ? " " No , but is n't it possible ? " " Yes , it 's possible . " " Dr. Nathanson , is it possible that in the ordinary course of conversationyou could say something and not know you had said it ? That is , mention the name of a person , a place , because that was what you had in mind , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did speak it aloud , unconsciously , not hearing the words yourself ? " " Is that what bothers you most , this possibility ? " " It bothers me , most or not . " " Why do n't you tell me something about yourself , Mrs. Lang ? " Dully , she began to tell Dr. Nathanson about herself . Everythingwas ridiculously as it was supposed to be . She had read enough , heard enough , to know that she would get no direct answers to her questions , that there were no answers to her questions , yet she had plunged ahead and asked them , and Dr. Nathansonwith pudding proficiency had handled them in the way shep184could have predicted they would be handled were it anyone else in the world but herself in the nervous seat . How strange that after all the years of mental grooming for emotional surrender , she should find she had no talent for the game . She doubted very much that she would go on with Dr. Nathanson . Perhaps she was n't ready . Perhaps she never would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her what to do . She could not afford the time , money , or attrition Dr. Nathanson would exactto arrive at an answer , if he ever did . She had to know what to do with the house . She must discuss the house with David . Someonemust tell her what to do with her days . Getting a job would appear to be the obvious answer , but every time she thought of setting about to do this relatively simple thing  --  clothes , employmentagencies , interviews  --  something happened which she had never even remotely experienced before . The normal center of gravity shifted in some unpredictable way , and there was set up in her mind , her stomach , everywhere , a wild gyration which threatened to shake her to pieces . Going to a department store to buy an appropriate outfit for job hunting became an eccentric wheel which picked up speed with each turn of thought  --  which store ? what outfit ? what length skirt ? a dress ? separates ? younger ? older ? which store ? what length ? how old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheels , turning on questions of advertisements , agencies , interviews , skills , jobs , and there were times she had crossed her arms and pressed into her midriff to keep the chaos contained . It was temporary . She knew that . It would pass . She had had shocks , dislocations , and as a result she was unable at this moment in her life to go out and get a job . Not to be wondered at . If a friend had come to her with Dodie Lang 's story and had ended by saying that organizing for a job was beyond her , she would have said , " Well , it 's not to be wondered at . You 're in no condition to go out and look for a job now . " Which left her in the house . There was no place else to be . Peoplewere busy . People had jobs . People had families . Dodie was alone in the house . On the day David had phoned her to announcep185that he was n't coming home , the prospect of solitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , she felt , quite prepared to deal with the vacuum problems of solitude , but that was not the nature of the thing . What she had n't counted on was the volume of silence . Each room became an enormous conch , and if in fatigue or forgetfulness she allowed herself to listen too long , her head would be filled with an oceanic roar . Which was also temporary . It was all temporary . Something would happen , as it must , and her days would be given direction . Jean Ferguson phoned . " Did you try to get in touch with me before ? " Dodie asked . " Uh-uh . Not today . " " Oh . " " Why ? " " Nothing , " Dodie said , her voice going flat . " I got in about three thirty . The phone was ringing , but I could n't get to it in time . I thought it might have been you . " " No , Dodie , this is the first time I 've called today . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jean asked . " All right , I guess . " " Did you see what's-his-name today ? " " I did . " " And ? " " Oh  --  nothing . More talk . " " Heard from David ? " " No . " " Arthur ? " " Not today . " " Feeling low ? " " I guess . " The conversation was coming to its usual halt for want of impetus . Dodie wondered why Jean did n't take the hint and quit calling . What an idiotic mistake to have made a confidante of Jean . Why ? Simply because she was there , a convenient alibi ? No ,  |p186that  was n't it . It was because Jean 's style had matched the color of her own excitement at the time . " Dodie , " said Jean , " I 'd like to ask you something ? " " Yes ? " " Just what is happening ? Ever since the business with David , you 've been acting like someone under a spell . Why do n't you get in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Or is it me ? Have you got something against me ? " Dodie hesitated , decided to have it out once and for all . " Jean , " she asked , " did you say anything to David ? I do n't mean deliberately , but , you know , inadvertently  --  " " You know , I could have sworn that was it ! " Jean exclaimed . " In fact , I was going to bring it up if you had n't . No , I have n't said anything to David , inadvertently or otherwise . And I do n't know how you could think such a thing ! " " But how could he have found out ? " Dodie asked wearily . " You were the only one to know . " " The only one ? How do you know that ? How do you know who might have seen you ? And as far as knowing , there 's one person you 're leaving out . " " Who is that ? " " Arthur . " " Oh , Jean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say anything to David ? " " Why on earth would I want to do a thing like that ? What reason ? " " Who knows ? . . . No , I 'm sorry , Jean . Of course you would have no reason , and of course you did n't . It 's just that this thing has been haunting me . Please do n't be angry with me , dear . I 'm not myself . I know you 're trying to help me , to distract me , but I guess I 've got to do this in my own way , be by myself more . Sometimes just an ordinary conversation is beyond me . You do understand , do n't you ? Let me phone you when I want to talk . Please ? " " Anything you say , Dodie . " " You wo n't be mad , Jean ? You do understand ? " " Sure , sure . "  | " All right , then . " " ' Bye , Dodie . " " I 'll be in touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surface of consciousness as soon as Dodie hung up the phone , and Dodie hoped she would go on sinking until she was well out of sight . But that was not to be . Jean floated visibly , half-submerged , like a drowned woman whose water-logged body would neither stay at the bottom nor make it to the top . It was terribly unfair . It was n't Jean 's fault . Dodie did believenow ( as she had always believed in that part of her where real possibilities were shaped ) that Jean was innocent . But this belief affected nothing . Jean had begun her drift into the deep watersof oblivion on that fateful Sunday in October when David had appeared from around the house with that green basket depended from one finger and that fateful knowledge fully ripened in his heart . If she ever got that far with Dr. Nathanson  --  or someone else  --  she would bring up the matter of Jean Ferguson . Not that Jean would escape the aggravating process which turned all questions back to their source : " Why do YOU @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time ? " . . . She thought she had made such a special friend of Jean at the time because Jean had had affairs and every visiting team likes to bring its own rooting section . But why had she needed it ? She was not a schoolgirl . She had never been a sharer . No , what she had needed , and got , from Jean was the mild , necessary opiate of Jean 's stylish ignorance . Jean with her half-digested Reichian theories . Jean with her half-crazy notionabout the world being a network of male and female terminals and that men and women had a sacred duty to seek out their sexualcounterparts . Jean believed that . Devoutly . Some day she would leave her husband and become a sexual pilgrim in that belief . And Dodie had no doubt that she would , because for all her Charles of the Ritz tastes Jean had the makings of a true cultist . And Dodie Lang had made a friend and confidante of this casual acquaintance because she had needed that particular unreality asp188the reality of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could scarcely endure Jean 's company , or even telephone conversations , because Jean was the unreality that mocked all the real fear and uncertainty Dodie had lived with since October . At four o'clock Arthur phoned . " I had a visit from your husbandtoday , " he announced . Dodie 's heart gave a painful , terrified wrench . " David ? " she said . " None other . He hit me . " " David ! " " Yes , " Arthur said . " Does that surprise you ? " " Yes ! Very much ! I do n't think David has hit anybody in his whole life . Did he hurt you ? " " Damn right he did ! If I did n't feel so sorry for the bastard , I 'd teach him a lesson . I 'd make him pay through the nose . " " What was the purpose of his visit ? " Dodie asked . " Well , it was my doing , really . I asked him to come see me . " A chill starting at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to her fingertips . " Why did you do that ? " " Partly  --  principally , I should say  --  because of you . " " Me ? " " Yes  --  look , Dodie , what are you doing right now ? " " Nothing . " " How about meeting me for a cocktail ? I ca n't have dinner with you . Rita is coming into the city . But we can be together until about seven . You could get in within an hour , could n't you ? " " Arthur , " Dodie said , " what is it that you want to say to me ? Tell me now , and then I 'll come downtown . I dislike very much these fake maneuvers . You know that . " " Oh , knock it off , Dodie . First of all , I wanted to talk to David because of all the things you 've been telling me . You do n't see yourself . You 're positively spooked by this thing , whatever it is , David 's espionage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by the way . That 's what I want to talk to you about now . But if you'dp189rather not come into the city now , then do n't . I thought you might enjoy it . You have complained about the dreariness of your days , you know . " " All right , " Dodie said . " I 'll meet you at five . " " The hotel ? " Arthur said . " You 're not  --  ? " " No , no , no , no  --  just for a drink . " " All right . "  |p190Dodie  took the Long Island Expressway to the Midtown Tunnel . The city wavered before her , a vast , turreted pleasure ship afloat in its blue haze . She would come out at the other end of the tunnel and embark somewhere in the Thirties , zigzag west to the Fifties , drive to that side-street garage she had come to know so well , and then walk to the hotel . She thought of the many trips she had made in the last year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the late premonitions  --  gatheredtogether in one undifferentiated day . Because it was over . She knew that . Arthur wanted it to be over . She wanted it to be over . But even though she had been spared the real malady of love , her bones felt waxen with weariness . Perhaps it was not the end of Arthur but the end of David that made her feel this way . Perhaps it was feeling itself , the massive dose of it , after so long a period of none . Maneuvering on the jerky , conveyor-belt misery of Third Avenue , Dodie switched on the heater . When the envelopment of hot air made her clammy and nauseous , she switched it off . She turned on the radio , but even at low volume the music only added to the general clamor of traffic . How she hated the city when it was like this  --  or rather when she was like this  --  caught in the fierce indifferentwash of it , a stranger to its preoccupation . She had known from the beginning that part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the city . Not that she had been tied to the house in Long Island . She had had the freedomof the city for years  --  actually since Lenny started high school  --  but merely going into the city had proved to be a frustratingthing . She was not part of it . She , whose earliest memories were of the city , whose growth was in the city , was no longer part of it . Most of the people she had known had moved away . Those that still remained were busy during the day . There was a limit to shopping . After so many visits , her nerves began to reject the museums  --  orperhaps it was the museums , like the rest of the city , that rejected her with the cold eye professionalism has for the dilettante . And she simply could n't go to the movies during the day . Coming out , she always felt like one of the city 's tramps who had been ordered to move on . Arthur was a reason and a difference and a tremendous excitement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore a tremendous excitement . She had been bored sexually for years . Perhaps that could n't be helped . So many women complained of it . But why ? Why should an intelligent , virile man ( and David was both ) , why should such a man about whom you have cared , cared greatly , begin to bore you sexually ? Because he was your husband ? Becausehe was your daily and nightly companion ? She had not inventedthe situation . The evidence was all around . She was not by nature promiscuous . Rummaging in the dark corners of her mind , she had never spied the rat 's tail of evil . There had been no perverse pleasure in betraying David . There had been only her own pleasure . But why with Arthur and not with David ? And why so tremendously with Arthur at first , and then less and less ? Did nature mean for everyone to mate with as many different partners as possible before decrepitude ended everything ? No , that could n't be it . She had never felt the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The TV repair man . In over two decades of marriage , there had been the dependable quota of men at house parties , in shops , restaurants . PTA meetings , anywhereand everywhere , men who had signaled with varying degreesof deliberation their sexual interest . And there had been onp192her own part varying degrees of interest and amusement but never any intention . Not until Arthur . By the time the Gersons came along , the intention existed . Arthur would have been an interestingman under any circumstances . Three years ago , she knew he could be her lover . Two years later , he was . That was not bitchiness , to have waited two years after meetingthe man , feeling more and more drawn to him , planning the act somany times before committing herself to it . She had put David onprobation . That was an awful thing to have done , even in her ownmind . She had never clearly defined to herself what it was thatDavid must do , or not do , to satisfy the terms of that probation , but she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared . But what a deceiving thing to do ! If she had meant to give David a chance , she should have spelled out the particulars of the chance . But of course she could n't do that . To spell out the particularsof the chance would be to destroy the chance . Like all those stupid books on sex and marriage . Clinical approaches to paradise . It was no more possible for her to have told David what to do than for David to have guessed . She had been silently demandingthat David remake their lives . She had wanted David not to be David . Why ? Because David had become , fully and finally , the man he was meant to be . He would not go to plays , because he did n't like plays . Movies were better . He preferred religious music  --  masses and cantatas  --  to anything else . He read novels , books on history , religious philosophy . He kept going back to the same books , openingthem at random and reading . He played outdoor tennis when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He hated museums . He no longer cared to go into the city . He would do anything for Lenny . Sundays burned like tall pale candles . Evenings at ten thirty , David would shower , and then he would watch the news on TV , and then he would read in bed for half an hour before going to sleep . There were two ways in which he made love , he deciding according to the irregular pattern of his desire which it would be . Sexual consideration having replaced the Torah , he had trained himself to hold off his climaxes in/definitely . He would touch her in the same places , make the same noises of pleasure , and when he was finished he would sometimes say , " Darling , that was so good ! " or , at other times , " Do you think Lenny 's been laid yet ? " The years narrowed in concentric circles to the smallest shutter opening , as though death when it came would be a solar burst . But death would not be a solar burst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shutter . And that 's what had happened ; she had begun to see death . David lived contentedly on each day 's platform as it moved through time . If he regretted , longed for , the past , he gave no sign of it . If he had hopes for , feared , the future , he gave no sign of it . She tunneled back to her past to find in it a future she need n't fear . It could n't be lost ! There were to have been such wonderful things in her life . She was to have traveled , and she never did . She was to have had three children , and her insides were removed with Lenny . She was to have fallen deeply in love , and she did , with Bernard , who would not leave his wife . She was to have marriedthe man with whom she was deeply in love , and she married David , who was intelligent and generous and considerate and good-looking but with whom she was not deeply in love . She had never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her life . Perhaps regret would have been inevitable under any circumstances . She had been given to see in a ten-minute , heartbreaking vignette the regret she had been spared . This about eight years ago , when her parents were still living on the West Side , and she had gone to visit her mother during the day , taking her to lunch , as she usually did . The neighborhood was thick with the fumes that were killing it , as though beneath the surface of the streets a monstrous refuse heap of rags and bones and anger had been ignited . They went to a restaurant on Seventy-second Street , and while they were having their lunch she saw someone that memory denied and the possibilities of horror acknowledged . Bernard Reinitz . It was he . He sat at a wall seat across the room talking to a companion who sat opposite him . Even in the awfulnessof her seeing , she thought of what she had been spared . Shep194also thought that death , picking like a scavenger among the last morsels of life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bernard was still Bernard , though death had gnawed him hollow . He was dying . From across the room , she could see that . He bent to his plate in the strengthless way of a dying man . He chewed his food in the slow , blank way of the dying . His hair had turned completelywhite , his cheeks were sunk , and his eyes ( those blue , living eyes ! the seal and sweetness of his manhood ! ) moved dyingly among the faces in the restaurant , coming to rest at last on hers and lingering for a moment in hopeless recognition before turning away . Were it left to her , that occasion would have passed without a word being spoken between herself and her dying onetime lover . She could n't have brought herself either to disguise or reveal her pity properly . Always , since her marriage to David , she had hoped to meet Bernard , not thinking to resume what had once been , but perhaps to meet from time to time in some West Side coffee shop , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restored to her through such meetings the rich anticipation that was once in the sooty air of day and in the eager air of evening  --  anticipation stirred by New York splendors and Berlin accents and an affair that imbued every street corner with the throbbing immateriality of her enchantment . But it was not left to her . She saw Bernard and his companion pay their checks . She tried not to look but saw anyway poor Bernard fumble away from the table . She nodded at whatever her mother was saying , listened to her own heart 's funereal drumbeat , and hoped that when she looked up Bernard would be gone . " How nice to see you , Dodie . " The voice was scaled of all living tissue  --  a thin , exposed wire of sound . It was in his throat ! She said this to herself while her eyes made a thousand-mile trip to his dying face . " Hello , Bernard , " she said . " You remember my mother , do n't you ? " " Of course . How are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reinitz , " said her mother , unable to conceal her shock.  | " Yes , " he said , as though a question had been asked . Then to her : " How have you been , Dodie ? " " Fine . " " Do you have children ? " " A son . " Bernard nodded , his ruined face showing neither pleasure nor regret but the merest notation of one whose growing distance from life allowed for some impersonal remnants of curiosity . " As you see , " he said in that frail , unfleshed voice , which was still miraculously able to evoke a ghost of its former charm , " I 'm not in the best of health . " " I 'm so sorry , " she murmured . " Yes  --  well  --  it was nice to see you again . " He bowed to her , to her mother , not offering his hand , perhaps because the touch of his hand would have been too awful a memento for a former lover to take away . Her deathwatch in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Less than two months : Hans Bernard Reinitz , belovedhusband of Anna . . . She had n't mentioned to David her meeting with Bernard in the restaurant , but she did point out the death notice in the newspaper . David had looked at her , nodding compassionately , giving husbandly approval to her right to grieve . How strange , the distinctions David made ! Bernard was all right because Bernard had taken her to bed before the advent of David Lang . David had even intimated that he knew how much Bernard lived in her mind , and this too was all right as long as it remained a sexless , womanly nostalgia . While she  --  she had been jealous of that girl in David 's novel  --  no , not the girl in the novel , but the actualone with whom David had lived in London , the one who could n't pronounce her " l 's . " She had not been jealous of her becauseDavid had made love to her but because he remembered her with so much tenderness . The Bernard episode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one that separated time into the great bulk that had been lived on the often-troubled but reasonably sure side of hope , and the other , shadowed , side of the recent years . The bad years . Notp196immediately or uniformly bad , but slowly , steadily , and accumulativelybad . The onset of repetition as reality . The rumors of a different world she did n't know and could never discover . David 's willingness to accept this halt and downward tilt , a little ruefully perhaps , but really with more amusement than dismay , as if after all the years he had let himself be caught in one of the silliest of practical jokes  --  graying hair , digestive troubles , the narrowing of interests , the realization that the look of his life was the shape of finality . Worst of all , for her , was his gentle but insistent shutting of the family door against any sudden gusts of change . It did n't happenovernight . There were summers on the Cape , and friends , and a trip to the West Coast , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each summer , or trip , or evening with friends , David would return to his books and his music and his weekend tennis with a soul-sigh of contentment , certain that in a world of inexorableshrinkage and death , this was not so bad . He began shutting the door with the proclamation of his new policy of acceding only to the dictates of his own taste . He would no longer seek to discover virtues where they did n't exist for him . He would not go to plays that neither he nor anyone else could fathom . He would not stand before a single dot of color , or a blizzardof dots , trying to mesmerize himself into the belief that something in him was moved by the sight . And once , after they had made love , after their separate trips to the bathroom , after long minutes of silence , David had said , " For Christ sake , Dodie , what do you expect ? Be reasonable . There are deficiencies in life , and it is n't always the other person who has to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shape of her finality ! The dots and blizzards of color might mean no more to her than they did to him , but they did speak to her of the lost street corners of her life . The meaninglessplays were perhaps meaningless , but she could feel that they groped toward meaning , and that groping brought her back to the sooty air of day and the eager air of evening . She could not lose these things ! She would suffocate breathing David 's air of finalities and certitudes . So she took art lessons , but she had no gift for it . And she tookp197courses at N.Y.U. , but she discovered that learning without the hope of utilization was as lifeless as that shriveled mummy she had once seen in a museum , the one that had been buried with the clay pots and provisions she would need on her trip through eternity . That desiccation was eternity ! When they met the Gersons , she knew that Arthur would be her lover . Arthur had not closed his doors . Arthur was connected to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't love her , she knew that , but he wanted her . She did n't want to betray David , but she wanted Arthur . She had to slip through David 's all-but-closed door and be with Arthur for a time , even though Arthur did n't love her , even though she suspected a cruelty in Arthur 's freedom and an affectation in his style . How could she have known that David had watched , or spied , or guessed ? How could she have guessed that the room on which David was closing his door had its own private plans and interests ?  | " Just swung at me , " Arthur said . " Without a word . I have the feelinghe did n't know he was going to do it until he did it . " They were sitting in the leather and wood dimness of the hotel cocktail lounge . They had met in the lobby , and there Dodie saw the discolored welt bracketing Arthur 's eye . It amazed her , seeing David 's violence on Arthur , as though David had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'm sorry , " she said . " Not your fault , " Arthur said , shrugging . " What surprises me is that he would wait so long to do that sort of thing . Why not right away ? A month ago ? " Arthur shook his head and smiled . " It botheredhim that I got in touch with him . The procedure bothered him . I think he had some idea of protocol in the matter . I should have waited until he got in touch with me . " " What will you tell Rita ? " Dodie asked . " About what ? " " That eye . " " Oh , I do n't know . An accident . Ran into something . Somethingran into me . Has David ever been violent with you ? " " Never . Not the slightest hint of it . How did he look ? " " David ? Pretty much the same . I would guess he 's lost some weight . He did n't look wild-eyed or anything . I should n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good . He seems to have lost that satisfied air . "  | " What did you talk about ? " Arthur considered his drink for several seconds . " You , " he replied . " Yes ? " " Well , " said Arthur , shifting a little , looking off into another corner of the cocktail lounge , " after damn near blinding me , the conversation was n't exactly friendly . I tried to convey to him that it was n't just a matter of hopping into bed . I said there must have been some pretty bad deterioration before I ever came into the picture . " " Did he agree to that ? " " No . He did n't think so . You know David . Naturally he got literary . Rocks piled on him . The ancient death of having rocks piled on him . When he found out about us . Therefore I must tell him all . A moral duty . You know , in spite of his having hit me , in spite of everything , I have a weak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been like , living with him , but for an outsider he has his crazy charm . Sometimes I think he thinks of himself in the third person . " " That 's very interesting , " Dodie said drily . " What did he mean by having rocks piled on him ' ? " " Now do n't you get sore , " Arthur said . " I saw Dr. Nathanson today , " Dodie said . " That man is supposedto be helping me . I know he 's doing what anybody else would do , but I get the feeling that the experiences of his life must leave him completely unprepared for what I have to tell him . " " Then you ought to get another man . " " I think I will . I 'm sure Dr. Nathanson is perfectly competent , but I just have this feeling of talking across oceans . " " Feeling is exactly what you 're dealing with , " Arthur pointed out . " You 've got to get yourself another man . " " What did David @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dodie , I do n't know . Rhetoric . An ancient form of execution . They used to pile rocks on convicted people until they were crushed . He said that when he found out about us , that 's the way he felt . Because he did n't think the relationship was that bad , ap/parently . He did n't think there was a reason for what happened . So I told him there was . " " Oh ? What did you tell him ? " " I told him  --  now , look , I do n't remember my exact words  --  I told him he 'd been stiffing you for years . I told him about the art school , the courses you took , your friends , your tastes . I told him he chose to be very obtuse about these things . " Dodie took a trembling sip from her glass and grimaced . " I do n't know what they made this thing with , " she said . " It tastes like something the dentist puts in your tooth before he fills it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Of course . What ? " " Manhattan . A dry Manhattan . " Arthur turned to catch the waiter 's attention . Dodie wondered if he had rented a room in the hotel . She would have to say no if he had . She simply could n't . Dr. Nathanson . David hitting Arthur . Arthur 's account of his meeting with David . This whole day . The thought of sex left her feeling ill . Something about Arthur contributed to that feeling . The way he was telling her all of this . . . " Would you please take this away and bring us a dry Manhattan , " Arthur said to the waiter. .. . as if everything had taken a ludicrous turn . This talking about her life with David  --  relationships  --  it all had the sound of courtroom testimony  --  or what she imagined courtroom testimony to be : the carefully supervised process of making a half-truth whole . What she had told Arthur about David was never meant to be testimony . She did n't appreciate Arthur 's making testimony out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with David anyway ? " she asked . " I told you . " " Tell me again . " " Your state of mind . You were brooding constantly about what David might say to Lenny . You were worried about David 's withdrawal , his silence . I thought it was stupid to go on that way when a telephone call would shed some light . " " Were you worried about yourself too , a little ? "  |p201Arthur  sighed . He looked away again , nodded . " Yes , " he said , " I was worried about myself a little too . I did n't like David 's silence and withdrawal either . If he was planning to do something , I wanted to know what it was . " " Like telling Rita , do you mean ? " " I mean that  --  yes . " " You would n't like that , would you ? " " No , I would n't . Would you ? " " Why should she be spared ? " " Why should she be involved ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's happened has happened , " Arthur said . " I do n't see the point in spreading unhappiness . " " What about my unhappiness ? " " What do you think I should do about that ? " " Nothing , " Dodie said stonily , thinking of her resolution , her heart 's avowal , that if anything should happen she would immediatelyremove herself and the consequences from Arthur 's life . Immediately ! She said , " Would you believe it , I never thought of myself as a natural victim . I never saw myself on the pathetic end of things . " Without the least premonition that it would happen , she was crying . A reservoir of brine filled and spilled over . She searched for a handkerchief in her bag . " Dodie , " said Arthur . She could n't answer . She turned her face away when the waiter came with the cocktail . " Dodie , " Arthur said again , this time with more appeal than sympathy . The tone stopped Dodie 's tears . She blew her nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struck a match and held it to her cigarette . " Would you really want Rita involved ? " he asked . " No . " " Seriously ? " " Seriously , no. "  | " I do n't see the sense in it , " Arthur said . " I do n't see what would be accomplished . " " No sense at all , " Dodie agreed . " Stop parroting , Dodie , " Arthur said , annoyed . " You know very well what I 'm talking about . Would you want me to divorce Rita and marry you ? " " How do you think David found out ? " Dodie asked . " I do n't know , " Arthur replied . " Do n't slough me off that way . " " Then do n't ask questions like that , " Dodie returned . " Do n't ask questions with built-in answers . No , I would n't want you to do a thing . Let 's not waste words over it . " " I do n't think the words are wasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Dodie insisted , " they are just wasted words . I know exactly what the words are . To do anything about it would be to make more mess to accommodate the mess that 's already been made . Is that approximately right ? " " Yes . " " Then let 's not talk about it . Oh , I 'm bitter , all right , but it 's not you I 'm bitter against . Or if I am , right now , it will pass . It 's not your fault . I did n't intend for David to find out . Had he not found out , it would have gone on a little longer and would have ended on its own . There 's some justice in the way things have worked out . Tell me , does n't Rita ask about me  --  about me and David  --  why we have n't been in touch ? " " What 's to ask ? She knew the friendship was thin to begin with . David and I had very little in common . I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , your husband . He does n't think so , but he is . And you and Rita have n't much in common either . " " I 'd just as soon we did n't have a thorough analysis of everybody , " Dodie said . " You 're right , though . It was thin to begin with . " " Not us , " Arthur said , understanding her . " Yes , us . " " No , " Arthur denied . " You know it is n't true . Your sex life was lousy . You said so . As for me  --  you were a whole new thing , and that 's always exciting . I knew what you were after when we beganp203toying with ideas about us . I 'm not talking about sex , although there was that too . I hope for your sake , Dodie , you 'll go on being after those things . Unlike David , you want into this world . " Dodie closed off against Arthur 's way of putting it , because his way of putting it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came when someone handed her complimentary tickets to a play or movie . " You saw David today , " she said , breaking into Arthur 's goodbyes  --  forthat 's what all of this was , an extended farewell . They would n't be seeing each other again . That 's what Arthur was saying . " Did he say anything about how he found out ? " " No . " " Did you ask him ? " " No . . . Dodie , do you want my honest opinion ? " " By all means . " " He did n't find out anything . He guessed . " " Why did he guess you ? " " Because the direction of your unhappiness led to me . That he happened to be right was an accident . " " Yes , " said Dodie . " You 're probably right . "  |p204She  came out on Fifth Avenue , coasted with the southbound trafficfor a few blocks , then turned east . It was night . The home-going crush was over . Vaguely Dodie was making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her thoughts unfixed , her reflexes and the car 's mechanism forming a separate intelligence . She was as far as Third Avenue before she became aware of her resistance against the movement that was taking her home . She did n't want to go to that house whose empty chambers roared their silence at her . She was afraid of the house . She imagined a criminal underground that had passed along the word of her solitudeand helplessness . A dark menace closed round her in a ripeningplan of rape , robbery , and murder . At night , she left lights burning in every strategic corner of the house . She had telephoned her mother several times since David had left , but each time she had come to the point of informing her of recent events a tremendous lethargy settled down on her , like tons of weightless eiderdown , keeping her confined to the usual vaporous exchange . Had her mother known , she would have demandedthat she come to Miami  --  this instant ! The next plane ! But the image of herself made mindless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created for Dodie a terror greater than the terrors surrounding her empty house . To surrender to the constantly weeping child within her would be surep205destruction . Her only salvation was to suffer the things she must suffer . Only in that way would she merit whatever betterment lay on the other side of this time . Despite her own wisdom and determination , however , she stigmatized her mother with the sin of not being nearer the scene of her daughter 's trouble . Thoughts of her aloneness and her mother and her parting from Arthur and David 's persistent silence filled Dodie with such aching pity for the weeping child that scarcely before she realized she was doing so she had reversed her course , turned west , and was proceedingtoward that part of the city where some gift of recompense could be found . She passed through the insidious park and came out on Central Park West , feeling nerve endings of memory tingle but knowing from experience that these streets could be no more than a shoddy imitation of the sanctuary in her mind . Still she drove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old apartment house that gave her no salutation from its brick-sealed senescence . She wound through streets , fearful of stopping , fearfulof going home , fearful of shuttling back and forth , a lost thread on the loom of her past . Arthur had said , " Goodbye is nonsense . There 's no reason why you and I should lose each other . I wanted to help you , but I see I ca n't do that now . I only aggravate you . You 're in a bind , and you have no patience with anything that is n't a definite answer . Okay . I can understand that . That 's why I say it would be best if we did n't see each other for a time . But for Christ sake , Dodie , do n't let yourself be talked back into the cocoon ! You 're too vital . You belong in the world . " All this on the sidewalk in front of the garage , Arthur a little impatient , because they had talked and talked and now it was late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was supposed to meet her , and Dodie for the first time felt hatred because for all the truth of what he was saying Arthur was going off to his life with only a bruised eye , no complications , and just a reasonable amount of regret , while she had n't even glimpsed the beginnings of her own future . Besides which , Arthur was beingp206surprisingly stupid if he thought that any amount of intelligence could absorb these poisons and remain unsickened by them . Dodie had to press hard on the brake as a car suddenly bolted out from the curb and raced for the corner , tires squealing hot derision . She saw a head appear out the right window , and then a face looked back . A grin . The head ducked back into the car . One arm came out , raised upward , the middle finger signaling obscenity . Fearful they might wait for her at the corner , Dodie pulled up a car 's length , then backed into the empty space . When the traffic light changed , the car at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the ignition , the lights , locked the doors , and got out of the car . She walked to Broadway  --  and then to the restaurant where she had once seen a dying Bernard . She was put in a corner opposite an elderly man who looked up from his newspaper with an expression of fastidious annoyance , which he promptly corrected by inclining his head in a formal way . His manner plainly indicated that he thought these intrusions barbarous , but please to keep to your side of the table and I will keep to mine . It 's the best we can do . Above all  --  silence ! She was hungry , but she did n't want the complications of a meal , so she ordered a sandwich . Later , she would have a piece of their delicious , fattening pastry . There was a party of four at the next table , two men and two women . Bernard 's generation . They spoke in German . One of the men , the one sitting diagonally opposite her , slouched in his chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiar look of enervation on his face . His lips were pursed . He was listening to the woman next to him talk . She talked animatedly , twiddling her hands , the fingers of which flashed green , diamond , and gold . The woman 's high voice , the man 's look of ancient boredom , the special accent pouring pauselessly from the woman 's lips , all of it mixed in Dodie 's mind to create a stir of familiarity . Then the man who listened with pursed lips turned his head slowly and gazed at Dodie with a directness and appeal that seemed to draw on years of the most profoundly realized intimacy . He smiled a shadow of a smile in acknowledgment of their secret.  |p207Dodie  felt a sea swell of time lift her powerfully and settle her once again . The man did n't know her at all . He had been listening to what his wife , or ex-wife , or friend , or lover had been saying . At last he closed his eyes , gave a half-roll to his head , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to voice soft objections to the woman 's monologue . Dodie sat at the edge of revelation , waiting for it to come , as she had waited at other times for persons and places to order themselves with a last click of adjustment into the perfect re-creation of some former time . It came at last , out of her easily summoned past  --  the musicians and artists and writers who had arrived from the charred corners of Europe ; people who pursed their lips , nodded their heads , said , " Mmyah-h  --  " and looked at one another with the same bestowals and withdrawals of an intimacy that had never existed . She recalled Bernard in a gray suit holding the hand of an old woman in both of his , murmuring German consolations . Who was that woman ? Oh , yes ! The mother of the pianist whose own hands had miraculously recovered their suppleness after the frostbites of three concentration camps . She recalled the massive woman with the pretty face who sang lieder and whose passion was to gather enough money to open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one-legged artist who had offered to do her portrait " for all the kindnesses " and who had flung a charcoal across the room because her face was too " plastic , " too " American ! " He was n't a very good artist , poor man . In the early days of her affair with Arthur , she had told him about all the broken and unbroken people she had come to know , but she had n't told him about the artist who had attempted her portrait , and for some reason this seemed an important omission , so Dodie turned inwardly toward Arthur and experienced for the first time the loss of Arthur in the perspective of time . He was part of her past , too , and this knowledgemade her turn to David , to whom she had told everything at one time or another . But David , she discovered , was neither past nor present . He was suspended in time , mysterious , faceless , havingremoved himself in a totally unpredictable way.  |p208The  waiter came with her sandwich . The bread was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back on the plate the half she was holding . The elderly man peeped over his paper , solemn and knowing . He said , " This is one place I can tell you , my dear lady , never to order a sandwich . Something hot , yes . Pastry , yes . But never a sandwich . It is not a specialite "  --  giving the last word the French pronunciation . Then he returned to his paper , not the least bit interested in pursuing the matter . Dodie said , " Thank you , " not knowing what else to say , remaining suspended for several seconds between amusement and annoyance , deciding at last that she was more amused than annoyed . She picked up the sandwich and ate it , and it was n't bad , only one of the slices was stale . She glanced over at the foursome . The lady who had twiddled her fingers was still doing so , and the gentleman who had listened to it all for a thousand years was still listening . Amusement grew in Dodie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setting that was the absolute allegory of her life , although she could n't have said how . No , though her life depended on it she could n't have analyzed it , but she sat in a radiance of assent , confirmed at last in her response to those plays that could never be explained . Someday she must , divorced or still married , tell David of this incident . She must explain to him that the wrongness was to reason with those plays . Rather one must let the patterns of the play fall on the nerves , scene by scene , as this scene had fallen on her nerves , bringing recognition of that unreasonable brilliance of insight which always occurs when one is alone . Of course she would never be able to tell this to David , or to anyone else , because it was a revelation she could contain for only a few moments , and it was already passingout of her grasp . She ordered pastry and coffee . The pastry was delicious . " You were right , " she said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . She tipped , paid , left the restaurant . She walked back in the green , red , and diamond night to where she had parked the car . When she reached the corner of the street ,  |p209two  boys ran out of the darkness of West End Avenue into the streetlight of the corner , passing a basketball between them . " Hey , lady , catch ! " cried one , making as if to shoot the ball at her . Dodie flinched and raised one arm . The smaller of the boys laughed . She was not frightened , only angered . She walked on , looking her futile rebuke at the boy . He was about twelve or thirteen , curlyheaded , wearing a zipper jacket . He grinned at her . " Whatsa matter , lady , you do n't like to play ? " he asked insolently , then repeated his quick shooting movement . Again Dodie flinched and became aware that the older boy was walking beside her . " You got something for me ? " he asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Hey , lady  --  " the little one called . " You got something for me ? " the older boy repeated . " How about a dollar ? You got a dollar , lady ? " Dodie 's heart was pounding . She seriously considered calling for help , but in that moment she thought of Lenny , and she felt she owed it to Lenny , for what reason she could n't have said , not to be panicked . " Oh , go away ! " she said . The older boy , who walked on her left and a half-pace behind , the distance of nightmare , said , " How about a fuck , lady ? I got a big cock . " Dodie increased her pace toward the car , remembering that it was locked , and that she fumbled endlessly with keys when she was upset , and that she would be helpless prey for a ghastly length of time before she would be safe in the car , so she said , " Will you leave me alone if I give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sure , lady , " and Dodie realized that if she removed the strap of her pocketbook from the crook of her arm , that boy would grab it and run , and while she did n't care about the bag or the money , the car keys were in the bag , so she cried out in a shaking voice , " You 'd better leave me alone right now ! " " Ah , do n't cry , lady , " said the little one , still grinning and coming closer . And there was no one on the street ! Not a soul ! Furiously , Dodie whirled on the older one . " You move away from me ! " she shouted . " Right now ! "  |p210He  did . Quickly Dodie opened her pocketbook and took out her wallet . She did n't care if they grabbed the wallet . The keys were still in the pocketbook . But they just looked at her  --  curious , expectant . Dodie took a bill from her wallet , she did n't look , she did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As it fluttered to the sidewalk , a wild , gleeful thing fluttered into her coat , against her groin , down , forcing the fabric of her dress between her thighs . Then the curlyheaded devil danced away , victorious . " I touched the pussy ! " he yelled , and ran toward the other , who had the bill , and they were both running toward Broadway . Dodie put her wallet back into her pocketbook and walked to the car . She got in , started the motor , maneuvered out , and drove to the corner , waiting for whatever reaction would come . She had been frightened while it was happening , and now it was over and she was no longer frightened . She had been able to think . She had not panicked . This was what was happening in the city , and she had experienced that too . She drove crosstown again , through the park , in the red , green , and diamond night , feeling a tranquil defiance . She had depended too much on other people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she arrived home . The wroughtiron lamp above the front door was burning , as was the dining room light , and the bedroom light upstairs . Illuminated prayers against harm . The front end of the car dipped in the declivity of the garage ramp , and the headlights splayed against the house . Dodie thought of the Hunsingers across the street and the Feinstocks who occupied the adjacent house . They were the people with whom the Langs had established a neighborly nonfriendship . Drinks once or twice a year at each other 's homes , mutual concern in obvious matters ( births , deaths , fires , crabgrass , marriages ) , but real mutuality had been trimmed over the years as neatly as their lawns . It was the Langs who had imposed the limitation . It was the Langs who felt that such friendships would complete the suburbanization of their lives . The true friends and interests of the Langs must remain in the city ; or if not in the city , then at least not in the community . Dodie 's isolation was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car in , then closed the door from the garage side . She entered the house through the garage , passing from the utility room into the kitchen . She stood there for a moment listening for any dreaded sounds . None . She passed through the lighted dining room into the living room . After the relief of silence , she felt the usual assault of silence . She thought of David , wondered once more what source of bitterness or pridep212supported his isolation . Feeling herself sliding into the sinister speculations of the past weeks , she quickly cut them off . Arthur was been going on for a year ; that the first intimations were in Cape Cod  --  " a gray Cape Cod light "  --  no , that could n't be explained . Yes , it could . He did n't know then , had only perceived the possibility . Then why had n't he said something ? Done something ? Because he did n't believe it would happen ? Because he did n't care ? He did care . That much was certain . Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to write another novel , wanted to observe his wife in this involvement , use it as material ? Impossible ! But why impossible ? Just consider his behavior since he had left the house . Was n't that even more unbelievable ? Did she know him at all ? Dodie sat on the sofa smoking a cigarette . The battering of her thoughts made her seek protection . She cast about in her mind for distractions . What came to her was the sensation of that satanic little hand insinuating itself between her thighs . She had n't panicked . She had behaved well . She had thought of Lenny and that had given her support . She thought of Lenny now  --  and her confidenceturned to fear . What had David told Lenny ? What did he plan to tell him ? She had counseled herself time after time that it could n't possibly matter , that Lenny was a man , an intelligent , mature man , and yet there hovered in her mind the image that would be created in her son 's mind should he learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that every child successfully obliterates knowledge of his parents ' sex life . But adultery  --  her adultery  --  would end that immunity . She would be left naked in Lenny 's mind . He would n't respect her , love her . . . . The suddenness of the phone startled her . She stared at it as if it had slapped her . Then she picked it up . " Hello . " " Hello , Dodie . " Dodie removed the phone from her ear and held it about a foot away , trying to decide whether it would be safe to risk contact with that voice again . She returned the phone to her ear.  | " Yes , " she said . " I 've tried to reach you several times today , " David said . " I 've been in and out . " " How are you ? " " All right . " " Are you managing ? " " Quite well , thank you . " " It was about one thirty the first time I phoned , " David said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at three . . . . Dodie , have you been thinking about our situation ? " " Yes . " Surprisingly , she was in fine control of her voice . She had imaginedthis telephone call many times in the past few weeks , but it had always been a dumb-show performance , her mind carrying the conversation in the form of two puppets semaphoring information . She had never listened to her own voice in these exchanges . That determining quality had been missing , as had David 's . Just two disembodied emotions playing a charade . Now they were both present , and Dodie found that she was able to adjust her voice to all that had been , to all that was , even to the curlyheaded little monster who had flown off the battlements of her terrors to wriggle his hand between her middle-aged thighs . " What are you thinking , then ? " David asked . " Divorce ? " " Is that what you want to talk about ? " she asked . " I 'd like to know what I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . " You saw Arthur this afternoon , " she said . " How did you know ? " " He phoned me . He told me that you had struck him . " " Not nearly as hard or as often as I should have . " " Since when do you go in for violence ? " " Since I have sufficient reason . Could n't you have had your affair without all the usual nastiness ? Did you have to jump all over me in order to jump into bed with Arthur ? " " I will not talk to you if you go on in this way , " she said calmly.  | " I 'll hang up . I 'm sorry if what Arthur told you hurt you . But did you think we were mutes ? We talked . " " I did n't think I had so many shortcomings , " David said . " I 'm sorry Arthur phoned you , " she said . " That was a stupid thing to do . But it was n't my fault . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would have told him not to do it . " " Do n't you see him ? " " David , what did you want to talk about ? " " Us . I want to see you . " Again Dodie held the phone away from her . She did n't know what to say . Some inner gauge seemed to have been broken , and she was without the means of measuring her need or her safety . She did n't want to see David . Not now . Not because she was afraid but because there was a fallowness in her that must n't be disturbed . " I ca n't see you now , David , " she said . " You know that I 'm seeing a doctor . Naturally I 've been talking to him , asking his advice . His advice is that I should n't try to come to any decisions at this time . " " Yes , I 'm sure , " said David . " That 's all very well for him  --  and for you  --  but you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see you and talk things over . " " Why all of a sudden ? " she asked . " You disappear for weeksmonths  --  andsuddenly you 're back full of emergency . What 's happened ? " " Nothing has happened , " David answered . " This is the time it took , that 's all . Everything considered , I should be the one to judge . Dodie , I 'm not going to try to persuade you to do anything you have n't a mind to do . I just want to know in which direction to start moving . " " When would you want to see me ? " " Whenever it would be convenient . " " Well , Lenny will be home in a couple of weeks , " she began , then changed her tack : " What did you say to him when you were up there that made him decide to stay in school an extra week ? "  | " I 've already told you , Dodie . Just generalities . That you and I were n't getting along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " About what ? " " About me . " " That you were having an affair with Arthur , is that what you mean ? " " Yes . " " No , I did n't tell him that . " Dodie felt a catch of gratitude in her throat . A few listless tears rolled down and around the curve of her nostrils . She did n't know why she must hold this foolish mask before her , but she must . At least for the present . She would tell Lenny herself at the right time , but she must choose the right time . Right now she had n't the resources for that crisis . " Do you know that Lenny has a mustache ? " David suddenly said to her . " What ? No , I did n't know that . He did n't tell me . Since when ? A mustache ! You mean  --  a big one ? " " Quite a size . " " But why on earth would he want to do a thing like that ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does it look on him ? " " Not bad , " David said . " A little ragged and overgrown , but notbad . . . Will you see me , Dodie ? " " David , wo n't you wait a little ? " " What 's a little ? " " Three months . " " No , Dodie  --  no . I know it would be nice to take a year or so to examine your feelings , but that ca n't be my schedule . Surely you can understand that . " " Yes , " she said . " I can understand that . Will you wait until after Lenny goes back to school ? After the holidays ? " " All right . Suppose I meet you  --  just a minute , I have a calendar here  --  suppose I meet you the first Wednesday of the new year . Would that be all right ? " " Where ? " she asked  |p216He  hesitated , then said : " How about the museum ? " She recoiled from the phone . All her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No reason . It 's just the first place that came to mind . Would you rather not ? " " I do n't mind , " she answered quickly , impulsively . " All right , then , " David said . " It 's understood that we 'll meet on Wednesday  --  that will be January the third  --  say at  --  eleven forty-five  --  just inside the museum  --  near the art book store ? " " All right . " " Goodbye , then . " " Goodbye . " Dodie replaced the phone on its cradle . She continued sitting on the sofa thinking of Lenny with a mustache . As in a game of blindman 's buff , she kept trying to pin it on his lip , but the mock mustache wandered off to one side and Lenny 's face remained blessedly bare . Dodie gathered her coat and bag and walked to the stairs . The voice that had arranged for a meeting at the museum and had told her about Lenny was still with her in its insistence that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she mounted the steps to the bedroom that these past weeks of David 's absence had put a new , unknown beachhead on the familiar continent of their years.  |p219I  remember drives such as the one I 'm taking now . Drives with Dodie . Not in this leather-smelling little car . Not with this music , which I have put on to oblige Kathy , who sits beside me . Dodie and I listened to WQXR , and on one such trip to the Riches ' , I brought to Dodie 's attention the coincidence of Offenbach . " Are you sure ? " she had asked . " Positive , " I had said . " Practically every time we 've gone there . And not only Offenbach , but specifically La Belle Helene . Music to see the Riches by . " " Do you like it ? " " It 's appropriate somehow . Gay , bouncy , overtury . Right for the Riches . " Kathy , who changed her mind at the last minute , says , " Is this going to be a middle-aged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I going to be the only single there ? " " You 'll be with me . " " I know  --  but  --  you know  --  " Her voice is a monotone of irritation . I smell a developing crisis in her life . Brian Miller . The boy with the prematurely gray hair and the preternaturally beautiful smile . It is n't that I do n't care . I do . I 'm concerned about Kathy , but I simply have n't got the emotionalroom for her just now . She knows this and resents it . I resenther resentment . A few days ago she was certain she couldn'tp220come to the Riches ' , had other plans , but late this afternoon she changed her mind , asked if she could come . Yes , indeed , come along . But do n't expect me to pay for whatever double cross dumped those other plans . I 'm free , too , Kathy . That 's the conditionof freedom  --  that cold draft coming through a door you ca n't shut . " What 's that ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do n't you see it ? " " That 's fog , Kathy . We 're in a slight valley on this road . At night , in fall and winter , fog develops . " " Do you remember the night we drove to The Powder Horn ? " she asks . " In Vermont ? Indeed I do . " " Hey , how about Lenny ? " " What about Lenny ? " " Is n't he coming home at all ? " " Yes , he 's coming home at all , as you very well know . You were there the night I spoke to him . " " Thought you might have heard from him again . " " And you ? " I ask her . " What are your Christmas plans ? " " I do n't know , " she replies , gazing out the window . " I 'll probablyspend Christmas Eve with my aunt . Probably the next few days too . " " Your mythical aunt . " " I know you think she does n't exist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your fun . However , I 've had lunch with her four times since I 've been in the city . Her name is Elizabeth Cooper , and she lives on Fifty-third Street . " " And your parents ? " Silence . We plunge into fog . Odd sensation . I expected the fog to act like a mass of cotton covering the mouth of the car radio . It surprises me when the music continues sharp and undiminished . Giant gray amoebae swim through the headlights . Undersea travel . I slow to a crawl.  | " My mother may come to New York , " Kathy says  --  and I realize that there has indeed been correspondence . Really I wish Kathy well . I hope I have done her no harm . I wonder why I can say to myself that this sexual living arrangement we have worked out is meaningless , an interlude with no residue . I guess I can say it because it 's true . I feel sure that nothing will remain with me after Kathy passes out of my life . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God knows ! Will she somedaytell Lenny ? Very likely , if they ever see each other again . I have n't tried to be a model to Lenny , but I have tried to convey a general sense of decency and limits . Is it for my vagueness and inconsistencythat things have become so tentative between my son and me ? Does he pity me ? Dislike me ? Please do n't dislike me , Lenny . That would be such a fearful defeat . Insupportable . Were it not for Dodie 's defection , I would have gone on constructing bombproof fool shelters against the possibility of anybody really disliking me , betraying me , much less my wife and son . But I do n't believe that Lenny dislikes me . After all , why should he ? " What 's your wife like ? " Kathy asks . " Like ' ? What do you mean like ' ? " " I mean what 's she like ? Surely you understand what 's meant by the word like . ' " " Surely I do n't . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've tried to answer questions like that in the past . Do you mean what does she look like ? " " That , " says Kathy , " but generally , I mean , what was she like  --  the whole recondite quality of her personality ? " " I do n't know , " I answer . " The recent history of my life could be taken as evidence that I had no idea what she was like . " " What did you think she was like ? " " What did I think ? Well , you must let me think about what I thought . I think I thought my wife was a very fine cook  --  " " Marvey , " Kathy says , leaning her head against the backrest and turning to gaze out the window . Obviously she thinks I 'm going to be clever about it , and she is not interested in that line . But it is true that I have always found it nearly impossible to talkp222about what people were " like . " However , I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how eager . She does n't know about my telephone conversation with Dodie on the day of my visit to Arthur . She does n't know of my arrangement to see Dodie after New Year 's  --  at the famous museum . " You think it 's not important , " I say to Kathy , " but you 're mistaken . Much of married life is spent preparing and eating meals . It 's very important . It happens that Dodie  --  have I mentioned to you that my wife 's name is Dodie ?  --  from Dorothy  --  Dodie was  --  is  --  an excellent cook . Her specialties were French and Mexican dishes . How it worked , you see , was that she would try a new dish on me , and if I approved she would then try it on company . As I recall , once it became a company dish it never went back to being a family dish . No , that 's not quite true . Once in a while , it did . . . . You 're right , Kathy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward to company for gourmet reasons . . . " We enter another patch of fog , this one much thicker . I slow up as the headlights are swaddled in a gray density . The music cuts through clear and tumultuous . That telephone call left me with a new perspective of loss . I realized I was losing Dodie more through my removal from her than her removal from me . While I had stayed in the house and agonized , I was still negotiating with the evil that had befallen my life , but when I had moved out I had rejected the evil . The time movement had begun , slowly and hugely , as an ocean liner moves away from its berth , packed with an awesome cargo of lives and days and nights and books and music and frustration and fear and love. " . . . but I realize , " I continue to Kathy , " that what you are looking for is an essential quality in a few words . Well , I 'm afraid there is no such thing . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is there ? Then what 's mine ? " " Chameleon . " " What ? " " Yes , " she says . " There are two kinds of people  --  those who arep223themselves all the time , and those who are always changing to blend in with the surroundings . " " By God , I believe you 're right ! " I say . " All right , then , my wife was the first kind , the nonchameleon . She did n't change . She was herself at all times . For instance , she smokes  --  not tremendously  --  not as much as I do when I 'm on a cigarette binge  --  but consistently and without fuss . Smoking is an enjoyment to her , not a compulsion . She does it and thinks nothing of it . I , on the other hand , will stop for weeks at a time , and then go back to two packs a day . Another thing , whenever my wife would settle down for an evening , at a restaurant or a friend 's house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold lighter that I gave her on our fifth anniversary . She would put the lighter on the pack of cigarettes , to have them both handy . I do n't know why this bothered me so much , but it did . " " How was she in bed ? " Kathy asks . " Mind your own business . " " Oh , I see , " she says , returning to the window . " I have to tell you everything , but you 're not obliged to tell me anything . " " That 's the way the arrangement works  --  but she was good in bed . " " Does she wear nice clothes ? " " It was my impression she did . I believe the description would be called tailored . ' " " How long did you say you were married ? " " This June would make it twenty-three years . " " God ! What did you do in all those years ? " There 's terror in that question  --  for me , surely  --  possibly for Kathy . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two decades shrunk to a day . I can remember in excruciating detailthe minutiae of rooms and days , but I can find nowhere in my heart or head a sensation large enough to match the aggregate of those rooms and days . " I do n't think life is cumulative , " I say to Kathy . " In our house , in our bedroom , there 's a vanity table , and my wife would sit at that vanity table every night and apply creams and tissues to herp224face . Every night . But all those nights of creams and tissues have not created one supreme cream-and-tissue night that will serve as the sum of that experience . Just a succession of cream-and-tissue nights that consumed so many hours of her life and mine . I 'm not saying this as well as I 'd like to , but it 's the best I can do . And the hours that she would spend at that vanity table applying makeup when we were going out for an evening , or were expecting company . Kathy , we did most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places , and PTA meetings , and we voted and we paid taxes and we talked about our son , and we grew azaleas around the house . " I slow up as I approach the Connecticut toll booth . I glance at Kathy as we pass beneath a highway lamp , catching a glint of light as it slides across her cheek and silvery eye . " Does any of this give you an idea what my wife was like ? " I ask . Kathy waits several seconds , then says , " No . " I drop coins in the receptacle and receive the green eye . I race into second gear , third  --  fast  --  pursued by the indefinable ghosts of my past.  |p225Rich  lives in a house of his own designing . The northern wing of the house is a cellar-to-roof studio . " The little wop builds his dream house , " Rich explained to me and Dodie when we visited a plot of ground marked with a promissory bulldozer and Rich magicked a house into being with words and airy gestures . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If Rich 's wife , Vanessa , contributed anything substantial to this , I would n't know what it is . Dodie never liked Rich . She did n't reject him completely , but she could never fully accept him . She felt threatened by him . She never said why , but I suspect she felt that Rich , for all his artistry and artfulness , had a Mediterranean attitude toward women . She once said that Rich could have been important if he wished . I knew what she meant , but I thought then , and still think , that she was wrong . She meant that Rich chose not to infuse his considerabletalent with the seriousness that would have made him important . I think she was wrong about the choice part of it . Perhaps it 's because he lacks the ultimate gift that he decorates his life so cleverly . The carved antique mantle flanked by two small ship 's figureheads . The lamps made of rice paper . Weavings you would expect on the walls cover the floors . Animal hides you would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sculpture are marked by the artist : Riccio.  |p226Vanessa  admits Kathy and me , with a kiss for me and a wizard 's smile for Kathy . Women have a born genius for the man-woman thing , always managing to find the right expression . Even Dodie . Vanessa 's smile was quick , warm , tentative , and welcoming . A mother-courtesan with an eye for situations . " David , I 'm so glad to see you , " she says in her not-so-English accent . " And  --  " " This is Kathy Willens , " I say . " Kathy , " says Vanessa . " I 'm so glad you could come . " She takes our coats . We mount the stairs to the level above where I hear the voices . Vanessa has grown plump . She is blond . She has wistful blue eyes , a humorous mouth , a turned-up nose . I know this does n't sound particularly well matched or English , but it does go together very well . Rich and Vanessa have two children  --  aboy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mark is the boy . Laura is the girl  --  and her beauty has always struck me as a cooperative act of will : Rich 's dark fertility and Vanessa 's blond obligingness resolved into honey-colored perfection . I have known Laura ever since she was a baby . She gave me wet kisses . Only recently , in the past year , have I drawn back from her with the uneasiness that such overnight ripening can make an old , friendly , father figure feel . How many years separate Laura and Kathy ? Six ? A world of difference in the life of a woman , no doubt , but I am not as quick and instinctive as Vanessa . I have no handy attitude to pull out of my inventory of situations . I wish to God I had n't come with Kathy . I fervently wish that Laura is n't at home . I would n't want her to see the look that would come to my face . " How are the kids ? " I ask Vanessa as we ascend . " Mark ? Laura ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mark is somewhere below with friends . Laura has a date . " Thank God ! Nevertheless , why did I come ? Why did I bring Kathy ? I have n't got that kind of cool . Perhaps I 'm a changing man , but I will never have that kind of cool . My sense of exposure approaches nakedness as we reach the top of the stairs and I see Rich and his guests . There 's only one person I recognize besidesp227Rich . Ted Buchholz . Rich 's new partner . That accidental bidder at my postexplosion fire sale . I glance at Kathy , who has assumed a look I have seen before , a look of millennial removal her generationhas established against mine  --  masklike face , drapery hair , eyes fastened on infinity . Rich hurries over , glasses flashing . " They tell me the fog 's pretty thick on the highway , " he says to me . " Did you have any trouble ? " " No , " I say . " This is Kathy Willens . Kathy , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kathy , " Rich says . " Come on in . Let me introduce you . Let me get you a drink . What do you drink ? " Rich has the good sense to introduce Kathy and me to the others as though we were two people who just happened to arrive at the same time . There are guests off in various corners of the very large , very highceilingedroom , and introductions are abandoned with the understanding that everybody will get to know everybody in the course of the evening . Since I have known Rich and Vanessa for so long , and since , with the exception of Ted Buchholz , none of these people are familiar to me , I assume that for all the length and depth of our friendship there has been the wish and the time on the part of Rich and Vanessa to cultivate this whole other group of friends . Childishly , I feel a pang of disloyalty . Rich takes Kathy and me to the table of giant liquor bottles . Rich buys only the largest size going . At another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lord of casks , vats , great tuns of fermentation . He mixes the drinks we ask for . Kathy , after all , is female , and she ca n't maintain her distance in the midst of all this groovy stylishness . " What a fantastic place ! " she says . " Beautiful ! " Kathy 's " beautiful , " I have learned , is not my " beautiful . " Her " beautiful " may or may not be an esthetic judgment . A satellite TV picture of a Japanese student riot the other evening was " beautiful . " So was a newspaper account of a man in Ireland who had won a burial endurance contest . So is Rich 's house . " Beautiful " is anything that courage , madness , or singularity has made manifest in the world.  | " David has seen it lots of times , " Rich says to Kathy , " so why do n't I give you the quick , two-dollar tour ? " " Great , " says Kathy . Rich takes Kathy away . Giuseppe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as Rich once explained to me , " Riccio " did not mean " rich . " It meant " curly . " I also remember him saying to me at one time that a couple of hundred years ago he probably would have been a stone mason , would have carved cornices on churches , gargoyles , cherubs with little button putzes . " Up to a point , " he once said to me , " everything is an accident . Then one morning you wake up knowing who you are . I 'm an artist , and I 'm a clown too . And I need money . " I do n't know  --  maybe Dodie was right about Rich . Ted Buchholz comes over to me . He says hello , asks how I 'm doing . I tell him I 'm doing fine . And how is he doing ? Are things shaping up ? " Ca va , " he says , smiling into his glass . Then he looks up at me . He is a big man . Stout . He has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ears and curves opulently to the back of his head . Everything about Ted 's face is large and shapely  --  mouth , eyes , ears , nose . His words are cheeses  --  mild ones  --  Swiss and Edam and Gouda . His eyes are unnerving , the way they look at me so steadily . He says , " I was glad when Rich told me you were coming tonight . It gives me an opportunity to tell you how much I admire some of the material I came across in the office . " " Oh ? " " Yes . I hope you do n't mind my having read some of those scripts for the educational film . Particularly the ones on music and ancient culture . Very fine . " " Thank you . " " Are you doing anything along those lines now ? " " No . " " Rich also told me that you had a novel published . " " Long ago . " " Still  --  think you might go back to writing ? "  | " Difficult to say . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know what 's importantthese days . " Ted smiles , nods . His eyes have n't left mine for an instant . I wonder why he does that . Is it supposed to betoken a form of def-erence ?  --  sincerity ? " I 've always wanted to write , " he says . " Have you ? " " Yes . Plays . When I was a younger man , I was a great admirer of O'Neill . And Odets . Do you remember Odets ? Awake and Sing . Awake and sing all ye that dwell in the dust . ' And Waiting for Lefty . Still great plays in my opinion . Arthur Miller , of course . The trouble I found with the play form was that you really had to be an actor to be a playwright . That 's why so many playwrights were part-time actors . Shakespeare did , you know . Act . To write a play , you really have to act each part . " " Oh ? " " Yes . The Elizabethans were the last to successfully combine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfaction , I should think . " ( Watching him , listening to him , I have the feeling that my senses are being anesthetized at an infinitesimally slow rate . ) " You know , " he goes on , " when I was a kid , we lived in Williamsburg . I had a paper route . I 've often thought of writing a novel about those days . I know you will say  --  " I will say nothing . I let him do all the saying , which he does , without haste , without hesitation . His words peel off like slices of pale cheese . He tells me about the old men who befriended him and the ladies who tried to seduce him . I 'm amazed at the versatilityof my fellow mortals . I 'm amazed at this large , sleek , pulpy , tropical plant of a man . I 'm also amazed at Rich , who could have been my partner for so many years and then have taken up with Ted Buchholz without suffering some sort of emotional bends from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am emotionally unequipped for the normal range of human difference . I have created and have lived within my own atmosphere , filtering out the truth of other people . But I am by no means filtering out Ted Buchholz . His eyes follow minep230with lunatic insistence . Of this I 'm certain : no life is so free of dissimulationthat it can bear to look into another 's without occasionallyaverting in honest shame . Therefore Ted Buchholz is not honest . He is a liar  --  not just in these harmless enough fabrications  --  but in the private echo chambers of his soul . Fortunately , Rich returns with Kathy . My eyes gladly pull away from Ted 's and seek Rich 's . " How do you like the house ? " I ask Kathy , enormously relieved to be free of the mild cheeses and shameless eyes . " Beautiful ! " says Kathy . " Refill ? " Rich asks , pointing to my glass . " All right . " " Kathy ? " " Okay . " Ted Buchholz excuses himself and departs . Goodbye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I find myself allergic to your kind of dishonesty . Not dishonesty in general , just your kind . Rich , Kathy , and I advance on the liquor . There 's a young man at the table whose vague smile particularizes as it comes to rest on Kathy . When I say young , I mean he is somewhere between Kathy 's generation and mine . He wears a double-breasted blue blazer and a white turtleneck something . He is tall , fair , blue-eyed , and brutally handsome . He possesses his handsomeness the way some American millionaires possess their fortunes , not wishing it to stand in the way of democratic contact but emanating the ambienceof immense purchasing power nonetheless . For reasons too vague to define , I am suddenly apprehensive . I wonder where Dodie is this evening . I wonder what she is doing . " I do n't believe you 've met yet , " says Rich . " Bud , I 'd like you to meet Kathy Willens . And David Lang , my lifetime partner , in or out of business . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his real name . A beautiful Russian name , which I 'm sorry to say I 've forgotten , Bud . What was it ? " " Bodane . " " Bodane ! Bodane Gregory ! And Demery is n't Demery either . It 's reduced from something a Russian mile long . . . . Kathy , dop231you think you could stand talking to this man for a few minutes ? I want to show Dave something . " Rich takes my arm and leads me away . " I do n't want to show you anything , " he says as we walk . " I want to talk to you . Bud , by the way , is one third of an agency we 're trying to crack . Let 's go to the studio . As a matter of fact , I am working on a new piece . I 'd like you to see it . He is n't smart , that Demery , but he is n't dumb either . Actually , he ca n't do a thing himself , but he has an uncanny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As Rich talks , we proceed along a hallway , through a door , and down a staircase into the cellar-to-roof studio where the north wall is constructed entirely of glass . It 's chilly down here , and the chill reminds me of other visits ; reminds me particularly of that visit Dodie and I made when the studio was at last completed . I had bought a bottle of champagne , and the four of us  --  Rich , Vanessa , Dodie , and I  --  toasted Rich 's vaulted dream in Veuve Cliquot . There are two levels here . Rich does his painting on a platform above , and his sculpture here below . " There are people like that , " Rich says . " People like what ? " " Like Bud . Like Ted , for that matter . They have a speck of talent you could cover with a dime , but in this world of a million freaked-out specialties it 's worth a fortune . . . . This is the piece . " An elongated figure . In stone . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't care . I did it and then realized it looked like someone else 's stuff . As far as I 'm concerned , it 's mine . Original . Do you like it ? " " Yes , " I say . " Very much . " Rich laughs and gives my arm a deprecating shake . He 's right . I do n't know whether I like it or not . But then I never know whether I like a painting , a piece of sculpture , or anything in the plastic arts the first time I look at it . Or the second time either . " Dodie would have liked that , " I feel it safe to say . " It 's possible , " Rich says , glancing at me . " Arthur Gerson and I had our interview , " I tell him . " I figured if it was anything more than words , I would havep232heard about it , " Rich says . " But I should have called . I 'm sorry . " " No reason why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was more than words , however . " " Oh ? " " I hit him . " Rich rears back a little , his smile like the surprise beneath a magician 's handkerchief . " Come on ! " " I did . I 'm sorry I did , but I did . " " Is he going to make a federal case of it ? " " I do n't think so . " " Well , then , what the hell are you sorry about ? " " There was no emotional percentage in it for me . It was around noon that I saw him . Later in the day , the scene kept going over in my mind . It made me feel ridiculous . Such a puny re-action . " " What 'd he say ? " " Oh  --  this and that  --  about me , about him , about Dodie . It 's not important . Mostly lies and nonsense . Have you by any chance heard from her ? " " From Dodie ? No . Why would I have heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either . She would have told me . " " Of course , " I say . " No , it 's not very likely she would have gotten in touch with you . Although you ca n't tell . Explosions make strange bedfellows . She 's been steadily in touch with my brother and his wife , for instance . You could n't begin to appreciate how strange that is . Everything is strange , I 'm changing , Rich . My past is moving away from me . Each day I find myself in new territory . Somehow I manage to live in that new territory ; therefore I must be changing . Or maybe I 'm still in a state of shock , I do n't know . Tell me , Rich , what do you make of Dodie ? " " Now ? " " Not now . I mean what did you ever make of Dodie ? I know you had no reason to devote much time thinking about her  --  why should you ?  --  still there must have been a time when you had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , head cocked . " You want it straight ? " he asks . " Like medicine . " Rich turns away and walks toward the glass wall on the other side of the studio . " Listen , " he says , his back to me , " if you want to know what I really think , I think that you and Dodie will eventuallyget together again  --  and frankly I do n't think that would be such a bad idea . What the hell  --  " " Rich , " I interrupt , " one problem at a time . Let me worry about my life the day after tomorrow . Just give me what I need at ten o'clock tonight . " He reaches the other side , turns around , starts walking back to me but makes a detour . I wish to God he would stand in one place and talk . All this maneuvering about . What can he possibly hit me with ? Does he imagine that I 've got some unbombed area left ? He walks to another wall of the studio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago , " he says , " we were all out there . On the patio . I was grilling hamburgers and franks . We had other people over , too . I forget who . You know , it 's a funny thing , but there have been damned few times when your wife and I ever found ourselves together . Alone . There may have been an inclinationon both our parts to have it that way . I do n't suppose it 's news to you that Dodie did n't think I was the greatest thing since crushed ice . Anyway , we were out there , Dodie and me . Just the two of us . She was sitting in a wicker chair , when out of the blue she asks me what you do all day . You , boychick , not me . She asked , What does David do with the eight hours he spends in the office ? ' Now I know when a woman is making conversation and when she 's asking questions . Dodie was asking . So I asked her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you did a lot of things . I told her you answered correspondence , went over the films we were working on , saw people , salesmen , etcetera , and that you closed the door of your office for hours at a time and wrote scripts . I told her you had a full day , if that 's what she was worried about . Well , she just sat there , the way she sits , one leg over the other , swinging , looking at me , and then she said , I wonder if you or Davidp234know what it means to have a full day every day of the week . ' Something like that . That was all . And that 's when I thought to myself that my friend , David Lang , was in trouble . " " Why in trouble , Rich ? " " Because of the way she said it , " he replies . " Like water on the holding side of a dam . Quiet as a lake , but one thousand pounds of human pressure per square inch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I ask . " No , David . No . " I nod . " Let 's go upstairs , " I say.  |p235Returning  to the party , I count the number of people , including Kathy and myself . At least twenty . Perhaps more in bathrooms and other places . Evidently Kathy and Bud Demery have consultedon their mutualities , have located Rich 's audio system , and are now facing each other in the kind of dance that is done these days . Bud , of course , does it well . Kathy , needless to say . Ted Buchholz has fixed another guest with his glittering eye . The couple who was introduced to me as Jan and Bill Anderson have drawn around themselves a circle of listeners . Bill is a rangy , attractive , sleepy-eyed man who has seated himself on the floor , his back propped against a sofa . Jan , his wife , sits on the sofa , along with two others . She is a very lovely girl . They are both deeply tanned . I learn that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a very small island , not accessible to the tourist trade . There is something in Bill 's bland , drawling voice that informs my jumpy heart of familiar nightmares . " We did n't notice it at first , " he is saying , " but then the girl got up , and then the guy got up , and neither one of them had on a stitch . They walked into the water that way . Nobody seemed to be paying any attention . There were n't that many people around , maybe ten in all . So Jan took off her stuff and I took off mine and we went in . Later we found out that that 's the way it was on that island . Everybody . Like we 'd been looking for it , or it us. "  | " Just nudity ? " someone asked . " Everybody does their thing , whatever it is , " Bill says . " The men bring these gorgeous wardrobes , " Jan added , " and they fashion in the evening . I 've never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ male or female . Just fabrics and colors and styles . " " Transvestites ? " a woman wants to know . Bill shrugs . He is contemptuous of names . But Demery and Kathy have stopped dancing . They , too , are listening . " Where is this place ? " Bud asks . Bill smiles a slow , regretful smile . " Not allowed to say , " he says . " Sworn to secrecy . " " Did you join in the fun ? " Bud asks . " Yes , we joined in the fun , " Bill replies , looking up at Bud , still smiling . " What was the fun ? " another man asks . " Just taking off and putting on clothes ? " Bill answers that the fun was doing whatever you were moved to do . He looks around at the guests with a drowsy challenge , as if asking would they dare do the same , right here , right now . I look at his wife , the lovely Jan , and she too is smiling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have heard birds listen to the messages of their bird life , betraying nothing of their understandingto foreign eyes . I do n't understand Bill and Jan . I do n't know how much of what they are saying is true . I see by the look of patient amusement on Rich 's face that this is not the first time that these young and handsome people have chewed their lotus leaves in public . Perhaps it is their function at parties to suggest the intoxicationof a new freedom  --  of which no one avails himself . Or perhaps others do . I do n't know . Who am I not to believe in the fantasies of others ? I move closer to Kathy . " Is this a recondite party ? " I ask . " Is he for real ? " she says , indicating Bill . " Ca n't be sure , " I say . " Is Bud Demery a good dancer ? " " He swings , " she says , indifferently . " Is that another drink ? " " Another ? It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Talking to Rich . Are you used to drinking ? " " Are you worried about me ? " " No , not worried . I would n't like for you to get drunk , though . " " I never get drunk , " she says . " I get sick first . I get nauseous , throw up , and then I go to sleep . " Music starts up again , and Bud Demery , who had disappeared from Kathy 's side , appears again . He glances over at me with a smiling by-your-leave , and then his head and shoulders begin their invitation to Kathy in miniature rhythm . Kathy sets down her glass and moves off with Bud . I look around for Vanessa . She 's not in this room , so I walk down to the floor below and find her where I expect to find her , in the kitchen . She is arranging platters of food . She smiles at me . " Would you believe that Bill Anderson is a hard-working , dedicatedman ? " she asks . " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " He is , " Vanessa asserts . " He runs some sort of human relationsclinic . Is n't that odd ? He and Jan have no children . I 've never been able to find out whether it 's a matter of choice or biology . I do n't understand this other thing . " " You mean the magic island ? " " Yes . I suspect things have n't been going well for them in bed for years . They 're always trying to promote some sort of communalorgy . Bill is , really . Women have less patience with that sort of thing . Who is that girl , David ? " " Kathy ? " " YeS . " " I do n't know who that girl is , Vanessa , except that she 's sharing my apartment . I visited Lenny at school early last month , and Kathy came back to New York with me . Asked for a lift , and when we got to New York she stayed with me . " " Oh , David ! " " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motives for that imbecility . I was scared , alone , vengeful , and more than a little out of my mind . " " She 's so young . "  | " I know . You and I grew up at a time when such disparities were important . They do n't seem to be now , Vanessa . I am assured endlessly that they are not . I do n't understand Lenny 's generation . I doubt I ever will . But I 'm beginning to see that there is a difference . I refused to believe that for a long time , but I was wrong . I guess when you reject something very deeply , you must do something about it . " " Oh , yes ! " Vanessa palpably agrees . I examine her face for a few seconds . " What is it that you reject ? " I ask her . She motions with her head . Upstairs . " That , " she says . " The people ? " " Everything . I love Rich . God knows there 's nothing wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonsense up there . I 'm sick of it , but I think Rich is addicted , and that scares me . They make me feel that the world is coming to an end , and I do n't want to feel that way . I 've got such lovely kids . I think I would like to go back to England and live in the country for a while . I do n't want fashion and cleverness anymore . I 'm not that way . It 's awful . I do love Rich , he 's so full of life , but I 'm afraid I do n't want what he wants . " " And I thought that at least you  --  you and Rich  --  " " Yes , I know . So did I. For a long time . " " How bad is it ? " I ask . " Bad enough for me to know that it ca n't go on indefinitely , " Vanessa says . " I do n't know what will happen eventually . Please do n't say anything to Rich about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think it would upset him terribly if he thought I was talking to others about it . I tell it to you because you 're such an old friend . He 'll probably tell you himself one day . " " Probably . Vanessa  --  " " Yes ? " " About Dodie . Have you spoken to her ? " " Once . Several weeks ago . After I learned of your breakup . I do n't think she really wanted to talk to me . " " Quite possible . I 'm trying to find out something about **28;12362;TOOLONG in another . Not easy to do . She wears high sharp heels . A certain heft in her legs . Thick lipped and throaty of voice . And quite determined of spirit . Capable of manhandlingher companions . Who appear most mild of gentlemen .

Stepping over Elmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case followed by Erconwald carrying a french horn . The rear taken up by the lantern carrying associates the last of whom , Franz , stops to scratch at the stone work with his thumbnail . Turns to see me watching from below , nods his head , smiles briefly and continues upward . A peat fire glowing in the library . The dust settled and the volume of ancient air scented with a smell of the sea . Percival , beads of sweat on his brow came jangling his keys carrying his cellar book . I closed a large ledger found in a bottom drawer . With its lists of servants . Four stonemasons . Sixteen gardeners . Three boatmen . Yacht captain , eight deck hands three engineers . And on one ancient page two dungeon keepers . Nicely settled in they are sir . Facing the bay . Madam preferred being a bit off on her own . Did n't she pick the northeast turret . You 'd think she was ready for war . Skipped right out on the battlement in her bare feet . ' Percival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all about . ' It 's the ship moored down in the boat house sir . ' Ship .

Locked up it 's been these years . Now I do n't like to comment sir . But the lady and gentlemen . Now as I say I do n't like to commentas it 's not my place . But the one of them with the bushy hair . And the musical case I was carrying in particular . Now as I say I do n't like to comment .

' ' Christ almighty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want now to be out leaping a dance of death over the ramparts with them things after you . ' Percival leading the way through the disguised door in the library panelling . At the end of a narrow hall to go descending a circling stone stairway , Percival holding aloft a gilt candelabrum . Which could fetch a price . One will estimate later . If I get a private moment to peruse the hallmark and contour . The weight too . Five candles flickering in the damp chill air . Under arched stone ceilings . Past a doorway heaped with ashes . Another stacked with trunks . Rooms of lead lined sinks . And coming to a crossroads . Of tunnels . From one hear washing gurgling waters and the sound of the sea . Straight on , over the stone slabs . From which a cold rises . Right through the billiard slipper and a pair of sheep socks I bought said to be waterproof and homemade straight off hedgerow briars . Percival stopping . Set in the wall a tombstonechiselled with skull and crossbones beneath a coat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stag and lion rampant . ' The tide 's out sir . There be times now when the pressurerushing this way could break an ear drum . Now youp34would n't know this was a door would you . It 's the entrance to the wine cellars . In former times the catacombs . You 'd not get through this in a hurry . Nine inches thick of local granite . But like rocking a baby we move it back and forth and now just push right here . The large slab rolling away revealing an oak door . I hold the cellar book and candelabrum . The weight of the latter delights . Percival opening up with three keys . Inside bins stacked upon bins . The air musty and stilled . An oasis of dark purplish glass neatly nestling in straw . Yard after yard . Tier upon tier of clarets , champagne , burgundy , among the magnums , jeroboams , rehoboams and methuselahs . And further on ports , brandies , rum , not to mention madeira and the light green glass of moselle . It goes there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no wine harm . I do n't meself know a great deal beyond the pouring and keeping but I know your belly would n't ever be screaming with the thirst that your throat was cut . Now sir so long as we 're down here in the privacy I 'd mention that this Mister Erconwald took me aside and let me on to the fact that the lot of them are vegetarians except the woman and strict adherents to the metric system again excepting the woman . And sir did n't he then lift from his pocket an onion the size of a turnip and take out of it a bite big as your fist and chew as if it were the sweetest apple God ever grew . ' The jereboam of champagne Percival hefted from the catacombs was put standing with the gilt serving bowls and sauce boats on the massive mahogany sideboard of the dining room . Which without warning collapses . The champagne cork bursting from its wire cap . To draw my attention to the fine quality of the chandelier into which it shot dislodging a crystal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and smoking jacket lapels . Rosep35seated not far away on my right managed to quell a satanic grin flickering on her face . Ah sir that reminds me I forgot to mention you do n't want to step over them chalk lines I 've got marked on the floor in various places as you 'd go down through faster than the fastest elevator invented . ' ' Thank you . Is the wine ruined . ' Not a bit of it sir , frothing it is with life . ' ' I do apologise to you all . ' ' All good person there is no need . ' Sitting here assembled in much silence . Through the soup course of cabbage leaves and potatoes . A tureen of which was carried by Oscar and ladled out by Percival . Rose making considerable noise shovelling it between her lips . Having declared frequently on the long way to dine . ' I ca n't wait to get a bite to eat . ' NV hen Percival announced dinner he withdrew . Leaving me leading folks from the library in and out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Which I found finally by following Elmer . Whose big black nose fastened to some dog delighting aroma . During the search Erconwald remarked upon the pointed trifoliated arches . Derivative he said of the Khufu pyramid . The influence of which could be seen again in the pointed segmental arch over the mullioned bay windows of the dining room . A stuffed enormous python hanging extended from a minstrels ' gallery , open mouthed down into the room . Made Filler growl . And raised a subject which had me swallowingamounts of saliva and beeping out farts uncontrollably . Muted by a conveniently located rent in the upholstery into which they sneaked . Conversation not improving with the appearance of fish . Large and reptilian buried beneath a white sauce . Coiled on a platter I detect as Meissen . How does one raise thep36question . What the hell are you doing bringing a bunch of god damn poisonous snakes into my house . The guests draining their glasses . As quickly as they were refilled by Oscar .

She displays an unusual and remarkable neoarciform from the waist as it sweeps out to encompass the hip . The upper thighs are smooth , the appearance of hair beginning four inches above the knee and increasing in presence towards the ankles . The feet normal in every other way have webbing between the toes . And you good person , perhaps you would tell us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have my measurements handy . But I hail from Chicago . ' ' Ah , the Indian name . Means wild onion . A city built on a shallow alluvial basin . Important in trade and industry . But do continue . ' There 's not much else to say . ' Percival taking away the remains of the fish . Which one keeps tasting again and again in the mouth . I called for port . Heaps of it . A jeroboam . As just down the table my eyes lit upon a woven silver gilt dessert basket . Full of potatoes . Sprouting pale green tubers sticking out from ww r i nkled skins . And through one of which the mouth cal Franz presently makes its biting way . Deep into the raw . One is I think quite rightly scared . Be glad to get through dessert and onto the cigars and aged potables . And fathom . before it is too late . The insides of the cello case . ' Are any of you interested in zoology . ' ' If I may speak Mr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of us have taken an interest in the field . ' ' O. ' No true reptile or animal of a poisonous nature existsp38here . This has made the natives spiritually overconfident . The resulting blind faith has produced on the roads a phenomena of unlit vehicles colliding in the night . Restorationof the country 's caution would be interesting . And could be brought about by exposing the population to a lurking but constant threat of danger both fatal and unfamiliar . Electricity is already treated with carefree disregard . To our attention have come several cases of electricians licking live wires in the same manner as the farmer spits on his palms prior to taking up his shovel . In one case a coaxial cable introduced into an orifice , do forgive me Rose , carried current much in excess of a lethal amount . The subject professed obtaining a frisson from the procedure . Which we did not dispute or discourage . Is that correct Franz ? ' ' That is correct . Optimum thrill was achieved at thirty seven point nine joules . Over twice the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same method . ' Erconwald 's chin raised as he listens . A blond stubble sprouting on his cheeks . He pushes gently at the base of his wine glass . Upon a finger of his right hand an emerald sits the size of a brazil nut set in celtic silver entwinings . He stares at Rose . Who wolfed down three helpings of the haunted fish . And asked Franz to pass the gilt dessert basket . She took a potato , blew the dust from it and plunged in her teeth . She gasped . Spat out the spud . And swept it from the table top . Reaching for the finger bowl she drained it in a gulp . Franz remained quietly chewing his raw root and sipping Cointreau . Fetched up so fast by Percival that uncharitably I thought a supply must be secretly near at hand . The evening lingers . Blackness and raindrops on the windows . Imelda crouched half the evening in the shadowsp39by the fireplace pumping with a bellows . Raising a flame finally which attracts colder winds seeping into the dining room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As a pipe goes passing between these three . Upon which they suck two handed with a rather noisome frowning intensity . Always seems to be going out . They relight again . Rose smokes a cigar and between puffs lifts up her lip where she pokes a toothpick , blowing the unearthed particles to her right with a left hand cupped over her mouth . Morsels popped between floor boards will fall down into dungeons . Where the scurryings I 've heard make me certain a vast rodent population swarms . The creak of a chair . Franz rising . Bowing to me and the others at the table . Asking if I would mind his taking away a plateful of food . And all now trooped through the four tattered antique filled state rooms leading to the great hall . Take my leave with Elmer . Hear the voice of Erconwald , George and Rose echoing away in the direction of their chambers . I pass a window of the corridor to the octagonal room . See a lantern light moving towards the front gate . Stopping by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And the shadow of another figure inside the car . Making a total of two out there . Churn my feet back and forth down between these sheets . And under Elmer curled asleep . Undressed one had to dress again to get into this bed . Nearly wore the billiard slippers as well . So cold it helps calm my mind . As one 's soul hovers above dungeons full of snakes and rats gnawing at electric cables extending from folk 's rears . Nice to see them smile as a joule or two goes charging up . The boom of the sea . Lie and listen . High tide . Candle flickering will soon go out . No mention from the visitors about departing . May be gone before dawn . Rose flashed her eyes at me , licked her lips and went round the hallp40flaring out her skirt as she perused paintings and armour . I saw her lift up and peek under a steel codpiece . As Erconwald stood continually bowing . Heaping upon me good wishes for the night . Deep sleep , muscles replenished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to see you again full of joy upon your rising . Impossible to fit in a word about the god damn snakes . As he slowly backed away . Withdrawingas he put it from your good presence . Faint strains now . Of music . Between the explosions of sea water . An organ . Seems to come from that small window giving on the courtyard . Good God . That was a scream . Of unbelievable octave . Elmer . Wake up . Murder . Somewhere . Clementine 's shuffling billiard slippers descending steps past the coffin room into the main corridor . Screams coming from that way . Just take this spear off the wall . If it is a spear . Ca n't see a thing . What if they 're loose . The snakes . Get back to my room . And close down the iron shutter over the door . What an unspeakable but life saving thing to do . If the god damn snakes are having a field day . Or night . Clementine , spear first , passing on the balcony over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victim . A light and sound of feet behind and ahead . What 's this coming . Thundering down the hall . A knee high breeze with an unearthly squeal . And grunt . And has . 0 my goodness . Hit Percival . Somewhere low . It sounds like . It is . Fred The Pig . LikeThe natives Cruising unlit In theNightp41Oscar woke me in the morning putting a steaming pail of water into the jug on my washstand . Left eye glued shut , the right opening on a sunny day showing a world . Out there of rocks bulging from a meadow sloping upwards into a purple sharp pointed mountain . And north a ragged edge of earth beyond a blue black sea . Little white caps here and there . Poor Percival last night was poleaxed . Rose came hurtling out of the shadows . After Fred . In a tight silk kimono . Her bosoms heaving up and down . Uttering language likely to lead to a breach of the peace . Already badly broken . After a night of such terror hope rises wearily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Percival . Lugged him into the nearest room . Of some splendour with white embellished ceilings . Tapestries and carved four poster bed . A large dressing table with pots and jars , silver hand mirrors and tortoise combs . As I felt his heavy but steady pulse Percival gasped that it was her ladyship 's room in which he might breathe his last . But just as I dry a globule of moisture from an ear lobe this apt morning , Percival comes in . With a tray aloft bearing a great brown pot , a plate covered with rashers , three fried eggs , tomato and stack of brown toast . A jar of marmalade and white bowl of golden butter.  |p42Good  morning sir . ' Percival are you all right . ' Fit as a cello . Did n't the pig last night knock the knee back into permanent place . ' ' I 'm delighted to hear that . ' Grand as it ever was . ' ' I hope our guests have n't departed . I 'd like to say goodbye . ' ' I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched them a moment ago carrying in a stream of stuff that would sink a ship . And this morning there are five of them where I would swear there were only four last night . Now how 's this little spot for you here by the gun turret . Give you a view of the sea on this fine morning . ' What 's that . ' ' What sir . ' ' Grazing there , just by the wall . ' ' Ah that 's Toro . ' ' Good Lord . Whose is he . ' ' Yours sir by the lack of claimants but I would n't ever be nearer him than I 'd be to a thick wall you could get over in a hurry . ' ' Is he vicious . ' ' Ah if he has a few old cows around he 's harmless enough . I thought I 'd mention sir I took the liberty of opening up an account beyond there at the shop . ' ' That 's awfully kind Percival but as I 've told you I ca n't really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bills or the like . Sure when you 're ready is time enough . And if you 're not ready it 's not time enough . ' ' Percival you seem to have confidence in the future . ' ' Ah now without the present you would n't have ap43future . And sure the present is busy making the past while the future is waiting . And there 's no harm keeping the future waiting while it 's not here yet . And when you get there what is it but you 're in the present all over again . Will you have milk first or last in the tea . ' ' I think last , please . ' ' Now I 've got Tim giving a hand with the garden . Just beyond the wall there . We 'll be having a spud or two before long . With the old gun I 'll blast a few of them hares off the heather for dinner tonight . How are you with the rod sir . ' ' I beg your pardon . ' ' For the fishing . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pity now . There 's plenty to be had from the deep out there . And now sir I must be gone about my chores . ' Staring out the tiny window of the turret , Clementine biting into the red rashers . Laid gently upon a toasted buttery bread of wheat seed . Crushed sweetly between the back molars . Things not so bad . When you think . There 's no harm keeping the future waiting . Meanwhile fish , shoot and look at Toro . And if one is not mistaken this is the basket weave of Sheraton I sit on . Just like the chair in great aunt 's room . Where I sat . As Percival snored unconscious . And Rose gave me glances . Felt like a guest in my own house when she invited me to go with her down into the kitchen to make cocoa . But the eyes . Of her . Made one cautious and swiftly drowsy . I hesitated . And dead centre of that pause she said you wo n't mind if I go myself and have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great hall . A shaft of mid morning sunlight glinting on the display of shields on the north wall . Under which stands Franz Picklep44adjusting a surveyor 's tripod . As Erconwald enters the front door carrying a small statue and an apparatus . ' Ah good person , let me welcome you on this fine day and say good morning . How are you . ' ' Fine thanks . ' ' We are I think now sufficiently unloaded . It would not do for unauthorised persons to handle our equipage and we are storing it in a safe place . ' ' I see . ' ' Ah good person I perceive some flummoxity upon your countenance . It is we have certain sample minerals , udometers , hydrometers , recent and fossil brachiopoda . Microscope . Geiger counter . Volt meter . Plant specimens . And here I carry Brahma , the Omnipresent One . And this is an oriental water pipe . Ah but why trouble you with such trivial paraphernalia this morning . I entrust you have breakfasted well . ' ' Yes thank you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are glad to be rid . Should you have difficulty in your personal cycle , we have a most effective remedy . A herbal infusion in which there is a colloidal suspension of selected finely ground sea weeds . Two spoonfuls of the well shaken mixture will blast waste from the bowel with the splendour of the trumpet blown unrestrained . In fact we suggest this musical accompaniment . But I keep you . Pray let me not do that . With the sun shining . ' ' Perhaps you could tell me what your associate Mr Pickle is doing . ' ' Ah , but of course . It is unforgivable of us not to have asked your permission but you have been so kind we did not wish to trouble you further . Franz is most excited . But does not want to hop skip nor jump to conclusions . And therefore I would ask your good person ifp45I might withhold for a short time the nature of our enquiry . ' ' For how long . ' ' Ah . Franz . How long is needed for your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do not have to drill . ' ' Ah good person I see that latter word uttered by Franz has wrought again upon your countenance some further flummoxity . Please be reassured . It is core drilling to which he refers . The core withdrawn being easily replaced , although we may have to retain certain portions . May I enquire . You are single . ' ' I have three . ' ' Ah that is forward looking . And where do you keep your spouses . ' ' 0 wives . No I 'm single . ' ' Ah . As am I. And George . But Franz has seven daughters . Although we have made numerous arrangementsGeorge has not yet had the good fortune to cohabit with the female homosapien . My own occasions of doing so are infrequent . I am uncircumcised . My log book records , I have it here , ah yes . Of human sexual unions . Thirteen . " Twelve with harlots . Of bestial cohabitations there have been five . I fail to have erection with women to whom I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have inhaled the donkey distillate prescribed by Franz when engorgement took place immediately thereafter . Although I had parental consent , the subject was under the statutory legal age for carnal knowledge . And it is with regret that a law case ensued . The three of us possess quite normal penises . Mine being the largest both flaccid and in erection . Ten point seven centimetres and seventeen point four respectively . Ah but I must not delay you . ' ' You 're staying to lunch . ' ' Ah that would be most cordial kind sir . '  |p46And  dinner . ' ' We are indeed most grateful . ' Erconwald reaching the ends of his sentences gives a little inclination of the head . He and George appear cleaner than Franz . Although the latter is kept busy brewingup the horny distillate . Been offered the laxative but not the aphrodisiac . Take with me outside the discomfortingvision of the bunch of them , snakes entwined around ankles taking craps while they tickle the ceilings with their tools in extensum . Thereupon gouging in the soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ massively silhouetted against the sky . Smoke pouring from four chimney pots . Two great black birds throb wings up into the blue from a battlement , turn , wheel and dive with gleaming wings and zoom up again in the mild air . Bleat of sheep . Call of a lamb . From which Percival if he 's a good shot may get a chop . Or a trout may flip out for the breakfast table from a stream flowing by the castle wall . The legs want to churn and run , the arms to flail up hills . The voice to shout . To this gang who have invaded . When the hell are you leaving . Taking with you your ghosts , snakes , tripods and reek of onions . High on the northeastern battlement . In a bright red dress . Rose standing waving down . Look behind me . No one . Wave back . How do you do . Did you get a bite to eat recently . Wow did you hear that . Rose kidding around skipping over a stack of octaves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sandy beach and boat house . Where sits the yacht . For which I now have a crew to put aboard . Erconwald as captain . Donkey distillate in the engine to make it go . Clementine followed by Elmer passing his guest 's lengthy motor parked outside the castle wall . Packing twop47spare wheels on the running boards . Upon one of which my big woof woof pees . Inside a gentleman to whom one has not yet been introduced sitting next to the driver 's seat . Staring blankly ahead . Does not even seem to see me . I 'll put him down in the engine room . Of the yacht . Where his stoicism can play an important part amid the turbines . Which from what I remember of my naval career are very noisy . A narrow path descending through a wood of beech , pine and sycamore . Sound of lapping water . In the shadows a great slate roof of a large stone building jutting from the steep hillside out into the bay . A set of steps to a door under eaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ push . Good Lord . It 's got a funnel . Two lifeboats . Be my first command . After all my years of naval training . To the rear march . Step over the bulkhead . Toss your oars . This is your captain speaking , give way together belay abaft and keep your luff . You swabies . Clementine standing in the semidarkness . Saluting and smiling in the wheelhouse . Putting his fists tight around the helm . Could head this thing out through those doors . Smash slicing through the mountainous swells , sea spray on the face . Castle cannon blasting once more . Setting a route for the unknown . Brave mariner with a few selected female deck hands navigating a calm but titillating course while sunning on the uncluttered foredeck out there . And in here a leather cushioned chair for the captain to relax while one is underway . With some rather risque marine sauciness . With lighted matches , Clementine explored the ship . Ninety eight feet overall . Twenty one of your feet across time beam . Giant diesel in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tool table with wrenches , vise and drill . Elevator an upright coffin with a mirror to combp48hair . Could fit two deeply in love . Salt stained portholes of the main saloon . Flowered sofas and stacks of yellow covered geographical magazines . A crapper here and a crapper there . In which Elmer samples the rusty water , and rushes up and down the gangway . Chewing on the carpet , peeing on a stair . Take Rose off the parapet , down a dram of donkey distillate , turn this vessel into a ship of shame . Clementine tapping a barometer on the mahogany panelling of a large stateroom amidships . A double bed covered with a tattered canvas sail . A cough just to my rear . Making only a small area of hair stand up on the back of my head . As one gets used to the random terrors . And Erconwald . Slowly bowing and taking off a white yachting cap . ' Ah good person forgive me . I did see you disappear in this direction . And I came aboard but to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have already taken generouslyof your hospitality and a further imposition is unthinkable but pray , some friends have arrived , both of them people who will please you . And here . Humbly I offer , with the compliments of Franz , myself and George , a vial of the donkey distillate . When Franz has completed his precipitation of essences from reproduction fluids of the mamba , we shall of course , upon its meeting with satisfaction in our tests , put it at your immediate disposal . ' Thank you . Your friends are they just passing through . ' ' Ah . Passing through . Ah . Perhaps that might be answered by a brief description . He is Lead Kindly Light . His wife is a woman of cultivation . They have long involved themselves with kindnesses to those imprisoned . And they are accompanied by three exprisoners . Some women of course prefer to cohabit with the stored up passions of men incarcerated for many years . '  |p49There  are five of them . ' Ah yes to be sure . But I see dear good person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pray say the word and we shall depart . But may I say first that Rose wishes for me to send you her compliments . She discerns good person , as certainly do I , your nobility and your abundant humanity . Of which we , your most humble servants , gratefullypartake . I withdraw to await your word . ' Clementine stumbling through the companionway and up out of the damp mustiness . To climb the steps again of the boathouse . Go out the door into the sunshine and rush back up the hill . In the library , thumbing through the dictionary to the letter m . And listed below mama 's boy and above mambo , the word mamba . Any of several tropical venomous snakes attaining a length of twelve feet and dreaded because of its lightning quickness and fearless readiness to inflict its fatal bite . Clementine leaning heavily upon the edge of the desk . Inlaid diamonds of ivory surrounding a green leather top . Sneak back into the world by the skin of my foreskin , get somewhere to live and one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fangs . Which strike even if you did n't do a god damn thing to it . Like step on its head . Which you ca n't do because of its lightning speed . And twelve feet of writhing deadliness waiting to inject into one 's tegument . Voices in the great hall . Where Clementine tiptoes . Franz 's tripod erected in a different corner . Leaving in the one he has left four tiles removed and a pile of dug up clay . Percival standing amid a collection of luggage . A man of delicate stature and open necked shirt scratching his privates with one hand and holding a shepherd 's staff in the other . Next to him a tall , blonde broad shouldered woman , with a large head and bosoms giving the aspect ofp50cemented masonry . To which one might take a heavy hammer and chisel . And not get anywhere . After a long sweaty battering . Quietly behind them three gentlemen with colourful ties and more of the blue pin striped suits . Faces peacefully composed , each with hands folded , looking up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person . These are my friends . Permit me . Mrs Lead Kindly Light and her husband . ' How do you do . ' How do you do . You will forgive my husband and I as you can see we are covered with spatterings from the roads . And we have been appallingly misdirected by the natives . We do appreciate your having us like this . My husband picked up Erconwald 's morse late last night and we motored directly here . It is quaint . Do n't you think so dear . I do like the curve of the staircase . It 's quite clearly a later addition . ' Good person their three friends would prefer not to be introduced . And I took the liberty of suggesting to them that they be guided by your faithful Percival to chambers . I did not wish to disturb your scholarship in which you were engaged when I peeked upon you in the library . ' Nine people to lunch . Franz showing up late due he said to changing a bit in his drill . Rose changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs Lead Kindly Light kept art books open at their places . The exprisoners inquired politely if I required anything from their end of the table . I asked for the salt . Which was passed . During the three course luncheon of tomato soup , fried bacon and egg and steam pudding , Percival poured away four magnums of claret down the eager throats . I asked after Putlog . Ah , he is , if you listen carefully playing the organ . He does so much want to create for you any pleasure andp51thought music throughout luncheon would meet with your approval . ' ' Well thank you . ' Dinner brought the appearance of the apparition in the car . Who sat at the opposite end of the table , said nothing and stared at his plate . Candles were fuming from the walls . Percival nudged me in the ribs in the wine cellar . ' Ah God sir these are like the good old days . ' I struck from the cellar book six magnums of claret to be had with two hares and a sheep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hillside that it was a pity not to put her cooked on the table . Guests swept the mutton down leg by leg with a gurgling of claret . Erconwald and Franz partook of their own onions and watercress from the stream . And the exprisoners between helpings heaped small courtesies and flatterings upon Rose . Till Mrs L K L said you do enjoy your food my dear , it 's nice to hear hungry jaws at work . One felt that Rose would get up and put her large hands tightly around the sinewy neck which rooted deeply down into Mrs L K L 's bosoms now upright like heaving gun emplacements ready to send out busty salvos . I had the most painful erection under the table . Having merely put the tip of my tongue into the donkey distillate . And I watched as Rose got up , went around the table and put her hands constricting around Mrs L K L 's neck . Percival was serving seconds of the hare . Oscar pausing in the dining room doorway with the remains of the mutton floating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the platter tilted . Erconwald 's mouth open . To now receive a quartered onion . Ena pouring wine . Which she was doing down the shoulder of the silent mystery man at the end of the table . Who sat rigidly contemplatingan empty area just beyond his plate . It hasp52always embarrassed me to stand up in front of people with a bulge in one 's trousers . About to plan as I was someaj lighthearted repartee . To quell the presently brewing social holocaust . And maybe thereby get round to the price of butter , four pounds of which disappeared at lunch . Mrs L K L gasped and brought her hands up to grab Rose 's wrists . A large purplish vein swelling out on her neck . That , by God , could be the jugular . By which so many of us want to get others . Now a vessel protrudes on her temple . Even in this light she is beginning to turn blue . As her husband turns a page of his book . And the exprisoners rise . A swarthy one to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headlock and getting promptly butted in the face . The remaining exprisoner is feeling her behind . For hidden strengths . Christ what a crew . All turning as the remaining mound of mutton slips from Oscar 's tray . The poor kid 's face torn with alarm . Erased suddenly by a victory roar from Rose . Certainly not of Tralee . ' I ' 11 strangle you you fucking bitch . ' Erconwald did not include among his many descriptions of self and associates that they were to a man adherents of the doctrine that it is desirable and possible to settle acrimoniousmiff and bitter huff by peaceful means . And they moved not a muscle . As Rose contorts in the rather overfamiliargrasp of the exprisoners . And giggling now pressing away hands from under her armpits . Music in the distance increased in tempo and crescendo . Only need a stage and box office . One or two ancestors there on the wall might by the rate of their eyeball movement even pay admission . Percival with a new nimbleness since his midnight collisionwith Fred the pig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L raising a small pearl handled pistol taken from a mesh evening purse . Bang bang bang . Lead sprinklingp53the walls . Sending moths out of the tapestry . Bang bang , two bullets pinging upon an armorial knick knack . Exprisonerspainfully levering off Rose 's fingers sunk into the neck of Mrs L K L whose mouth 's open and tongue out , gasping . One arm outstretched , hand clinging to the gun , her robust sinewy qualities no match for Rose . Who is better at strangling than singing . Lead Kindly Light the husband perused his book throughout , taking from a side dish thin cross sections of onions upon which he squeezes a liquid from a plastic replica of a lemon . With a delicate flourish of the wrist he puts them in his mouth . And now I see he wears sandals over white socks just visible through the other crouched figures under the table . Must call for port to be followed by cheese and cantos . With demi tasse and desperation in the chapel . Where there is an altar to permit premeditated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the organ music as well . With my secluded feelings spirited away within me I bid the guests goodnight . Mrs L K L was led sobbing from the dining room escorted by the three prisoners . When Percival appeared with port I instructed it be placed by my bedside . The mystery man came up to me and with the saddest face I have ever seen , put out his hand to shake mine . Two enormous scars went down both cheeks under t he eyes . And one sensed he was trying to smile . Erconwald kept bowing low as he backed away , feeling with one hand to his rear and I confess I was waiting for him to step backwards over one of those lines drawn by Percival . Which sent the victim downwards . " Abjectly good person I tender my apologies . No balm bath the calm that I do wish I might anoint you with . ' ' I certainly do n't want to get bitten by one of your god damn snakes . '  |p54'Ah  . You have spoken . ' ' You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm saddened to note that you do so with alarm . ' ' You bet you do , those things are dangerous just bringing them into someone 's house like that . And then digging up the floor . What kind of behaviour is that . ' ' I am deeply wounded . ' ' With your friends carrying guns . Attacking each other . Turning the castle into a circus , I 'm really mad , no kidding . ' ' Good person my utmost assurance . I understand your concern . But most of the mambas have had their fangs removed . ' ' You 've got real live poisonous snakes . ' ' Most noble person , there is no need for qualm , only three of the fourteen can inflict a fatal bite . Franz is in complete control , so swift of hand he can grasp a mamba in the act of striking . I had much hoped had not the dinner ended with an unfortunate misunderstanding that Franz assisted by Rose would demonstrate his dominance over one of the most deadly of reptiles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ah please , unburden yourself of misgiving . Quick as the mamba is to anger Franz often inspires moments of tranquillityand upon occasion even strokes the serpent under the chin . Enclosed in their container they are perfectly harmless . Fear not good person . ' ' Fear . That 's all I 've known the last two days . ' ' I am grieved . Truly I want for an untroubled stillness to cushion your spirit , where no ravage ruin or thuggism may hatch out chafe or gall upon you . Good person , please . Peace . Perhaps you are not a pagan , as am I. ' ' I believe in God . ' ' Then you are with peace . '  |p55'I  'm scared shitless . ' ' Have you tried our laxative . ' ' Not on your nelly . ' Erconwald bows . Comes slowly erect . Tears in his eyes . Which avert downwards to my right . His hands hang lonely , a faint green gleam from his emerald caught in the candle light . The rumpled fabric of his tweed coat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his shirt . Forlorn and godless . He stands in this testicle chilling chamber . The great door bolted and pinioned shut . With levers , bars and chains . Locking us all in . With no way out . Unless you want to sail down a dungeon tunnel skidding on a sea of rodents . ' I 'm sorry Erconwald I did not mean to upset your feelings . ' ' My hope was good person to add pleasure to your life by our presence . ' ' With dangerous reptiles , exprisoners and one of your associates digging up the front hall over there . What kind of pleasure is that . ' ' Your thrust sir , pierces deep . I undertake to disturb and trouble you no further . Your humble and most obedient servant withdraws . ' ' Hey now wait a minute . ' ' Sir . ' ' I do n't want to make anybody cry . ' ' I merely weep .

' I ask but to be given the opportunity to prove that our present labours will bear fruit . Already one feels an expectancy . ' He stands with a patience monumental . His calm voice echoing and reasonable face gently saddened . Every few moments he shivers . I feel an icy cold pressing my feet . Tell the bunch of them to go and they could start jeering . Or digging into the foundations . Even now they may be sifting through the silver plate and planning to throw me out . Can I sleep on it . ' But most certainly good person . ' Good night . ' Sleep pleased , good person . ' Thank you . ' A chunk of red cheese , decanter of port and a stack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Things look warm but feel cold in the firelight . The stone hot water bottles make damp patches on top of the bed . Only that the chapel is over in their wing I would stop in to pray . Erconwald said Putlog had tuned the organ and cleaned the rat nests from the pipes . He would give a recital anytime I liked . Come to this barren waste and over night it 's one cavorting albeit cultured holiday camp . Winds whining and the sea pounding out there . One might sleepwalk . Off battlements into deeps . Percival said there was a black ice cold bottomless lake just up the mountain side . Full of strange thin fish , some so sharp they could swim through a stone . But at the end of the sea tunnel opening out from the cliffs and down six fathoms was the great conger . Lurking in a cave . Percival said ah now sir I did n't want to worry you with an old eel . But forp57many years they were dropping off terrible things out the end of the tunnel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Clementine of The Three Glands was shoving off there his discarded females in one screaming piece . Tim now throws off the odd dead sheep if Miss Ovary is n't in need of one for dinner . That thing down there devours bowels and entrails by the wheel barrow . And I 'm telling you now it 's thought that that 's the way old Clarence 's mother and father went as well as Paddy the butcher who wandered off the cliff drunk and none has ever been seen since except that in the bright sunshine pelvic girdles are obvious on the sand below . Rumour has it that the great conger remained mild enough feeding on the odd lad stumbling off the edge and that it never added to the huge creature 's viciousness till a protestant rose growing land owner was ate by the conger while trying to fish for him out of a little dingy and was dragged to his doom . The conger has been mean vicious and evil to a degree ever since , demonstratingquite clearly a catholic is sweet to the taste just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . During the fracas downstairs he lay quietly by the fireside . And polished off the mutton before Oscar tugging at one end could get it out of his great grey jaws . Which means he wo n't need a nightcap of my billiard slippers washed down by few pairs of socks . He contentedly looks up at me propped shivering in bed . No floor board to squeak in this room . Anyone could tiptoe in a good quality pair of sneakers and get me round the neck . And unless they were mutton Elmer might not mind . That 's a knock . On my door . Come in . ' ' I do n't want to disturb you . But could I borrow a toothbrush . I was wandering around this morning and saw your collection . '  |p58'Of  course . But all of them are used .

I 'm not a lady but that one is one of them cultured rich ones with her little puppet husband on a string . ' ' I quite understand . ' ' Well I did n't want to appear as if I was unladylike . ' ' No I can quite see that . ' ' How do you come to be living in this castle all to yourself , servants waiting on you hand and foot with not a bother in the world . If you do n't mind my asking a personalquestion . ' ' My great grand aunt gave it to me . ' ' You 're not codding me . Gave it to you . ' ' And Elmer there as well . ' ' Wish I had an aunt like that . Could give me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Flooded it is too . Did n't the three of them come in over a weekend and that Franz start digging in the corner saying that according to his map evidence there was a mineral deposit . There was a spring . That 's what there was . Gushing right up into me face . Leaving me living in a foot of water and terrified the landlordwould see it . ' ' I 'm sorry to hear that . ' ' In my boots day and night . ' ' That 's awful . '  |p59'He  put stones for me to leap from one to the other . The only good thing about them was he tried it himself and fell flat on his face . Would you ever let me have a glass of that wine there and a bit of the cheese . ' By all means help yourself . ' What a life with wine and cheese by the bedside reading a book . Grrrrrrrr . Grrrrr . It makes me growl . ' Here take this knife . ' ' I like to bite out chunks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eegits for a bit . They almost killed me coming cross country . Took out my tonsils . Operating in the back of the car with that maniac Franz driving . Could n't eat a thing for three days . With them killing chickens and cows around every bend in the road . And one old gentleman they took his cart donkey and hay rick right from underneathhim and the poor old man had ten years put onto his life as he came through the sun roof of the car onto my lap making a mess in his trousers . And that Franz beating on the poor creature with a riding crop for being in his way . And like they do to everybody they hand out that donkey distillate . We got the old man back to his cottage . Seventy four he was and chased his eighty four year old wife all over the place with Erconwald trying to train a film camera on them . Sure the distillate 's a fake , the old man was just knocked out of his senses . ' Why do you stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city limits I 'm on combat remuneration so to speak . With the car stinking of onions and their instruments sticking in my backside . They take my rectal temperature every morning . That 's an extra pound a week I get for that lark . With them carrying on all the time about precision . ' What about your singing . ' That . Sure the opera they put on was the greatest fiascop60in the history of performing arts . Franz back stage was putting out a smoke to make a low fog for an ostrich to walk through with its head sticking out the top of it . He said the authenticity of such a scene would be unforgettable . Well I can tell you this bird nearly eight feet high and three hundred weight gave authenticity aplenty when the thing got off the stage and ran amok in the audience . The three of them have been sued ever since for two broken legs and concussions too numerous to mention with the theatre left like a battlefield . That was the end of me own operatic career . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to me they are very inconsiderate . ' Inconsiderate , do n't make me laugh . They are dan-gerous . ' ' O God .

' But I 'll tell you one thing . They are the only three honest people I have ever met in this country . Not once was I ever diddled out of a penny . And they keep their word to the letter . Sure at Christmas time they distribute dozens of ducks to the poor and educate little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They refuse no one a kindness . I 've seen Erconwald with me own eyes walk along the Green with a bunch of little scallywags beggingp61pennies and he 'd empty his pockets to them . Old women dying up there behind the brewery have them to thank for peaceful last moments on this earth . With their own familiestrying to cuff them into their graves , you would see Erconwald , Putlog and Franz putting balm on the poor creature 's forehead and giving her jelly beans and cream lemon delights to eat . While the savages were drinking outside the door merrymaking in a hurry to get the poor old thing under the sods . Would you mind if I sat down . ' ' No please do . ' ' You could start a good little business in this place . ' Rose renewing her glass of port .

After winning the contest the three of them in white coats subjected me to a rude intimate examination with stethoscopesand blood pressure contraptions . Said my breath was n't what it should be , caused by the inner contamination . Sure I listened to them , I had to , strapped stark naked as I was on my back to an operating table under a big sky light with the clouds going over above right in the best part of town .

The rusty springs of the lumpy mattressp65squealing . She 's trying to open my pyjamas which are on backwards . But through the arse of which I forged a hole for peeing . By constantly making this mistake each time I had to take a midnight leak on my storm tossed trip across the seas . To reach this land . After a eleven and a half days of nautical horror . Witnessed in silence . At the long end of a nervous decline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding myself back . Not wanting to go just yet . But inchingthere all the same . Waking each day at dawn . The light cold with death . My great aunt sitting through afternoons clown below in her gabled house on a shady street . Where I watched the milkman , mailman and garbage collector come and go . And like Erconwald does with Rose I took my rectal temperature . Measuring the slow combustion of the fatal disease . Taking me around the throat and arse . Parts it seemed to fancy . As my aunt 's servants went out my bedroom door shaking their heads . With the trays of untouched food . Seven ounces less I weighed each day . Looking at my white tongue in the mirror . New pains behind eyeballs . Doom fuming up from the outstretchedsupplicant palms of my hands . Had I known Franz , Erconwald and Putlog then they could have squirted a tonic vapour down my throat and an aeriform serum up my arse . To meet in the belly for a gaseous eruption and blow both hips out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am under Rose 's two massive swingingbreasts and cascading hair . Growling and biting . What a change from crawling down the last mile . Auntie rolling in my bedroom door in her wheel chair , telling me I was just like my father . He was big and strong . Buried my mother and three more after her . Screwed to death . It was rumoured by doctors who diagnosed an agitation caused by his testicular trinity . An uncontrollable temper kept him in excellent condition . Leaping as he did out at trafficp66lights to drag some poor unfortunate from another car who had the folly to sneer at him at a previous traffic light . I sat in the front seat . A little boy with curls and enormous sad eyes . Standing up to see as my father used his usual right hook to lay a chap backwards over the engine hood . Climbing to the rear seat to peek out and see the victim cross eagled unconscious . Goodness Rose you are strong . Got me by the wrists . Winds raging outside . Last candle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back in . As you wait and never see it . Till a time comes . Just like this . The Charnel Castle cure . New vigorous lethal terrors drive out the stale mouldering ones under which one was smothering . Still begging for mummy . To come back . She left on a sunny day . In an ambulance from the side of a house . Carried out on a stretcher and loaded in the shade of the old coach porch . Pressed my nose to the copper screen . My father said mummy wanted peace and quiet . He would take me to see her soon . We went on a rainy day . Down town . It had snowed in the morning and now the streets were grey with slush . Pipes tingling and throbbingin the hospital . We went up three floors in an elevator and down a long corridor . A little boy pushed by sobbing on a trolley . His own mummy holding his clothes in her arms . We came to a door and I felt chilled . As I stood , my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . See your mother . There she is . Go over to her . A silhouette as she lay on the bed , her long delicate nose , eyes closed and her wavy brown hair spread on the pillow . Out the window the roof of another building covered with pipes and roofed with little grey pebbly stones . The sky darkened , rain falling straight and hard . Old snow tucked in the corners of roof tops . My father standing at the door . My mother 's hand was pale . Her nails white at the finger tips . I reached over and touched her . I did n't know whatp67dead was . Until the tears started to come out of my eyes . And when I turned around my father was gone . I looked clown the hall and saw him talking with a doctor . A nurse passed me to go into the room . I stood at the door and watched her pull a white cover over my mother 's face .

And after all these obtuse thursday goings on , would that I sleep . Buried under Rose 's snores . Clementine rolling his head back and forth under Rose 's hair . Till a great moist nose peeked through followed by the tongue and paws of Elmer . Who wanted to join the fun . Pushing his monstrous head between the two of us . Just as one is tasting the tip top joys again way up inside Rose . As she sleeps and now wakes roaring . And growling just like Elmer . ' Ah God it 's the dog on us . Is he vicious . Get him away from me altogether . ' ' Out Elmer . Naughty dog . He 's only playing . ' ' He took a nip out of me . ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lonely . ' ' Woof woof .

' ' While he takes it into his head to make a horse dover of one of me appendages . ' Rose is somewhat savoury under the oxsters . Inciting Elmer who according to a mouldering dog reference book in the library can distinguish more smells than you could shake a mamba at . He only wants to know what sniffs . Between the strong muscles in Rose 's thighs . Which grip me with pincers of knob ended knees . What on earth am I going to do with one unearthly wind ready to break . Right from the bowels of my conscience . So awkward after one remonstrates over incivility to a canine . To then unleash a stench closeted with layers of dank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emblazoned motheaten counterpane . Under which the two of us are unavoidably heavily breathing . Do please , everybody , get ready . As I ease it out . With no tune . Don masks . Sneak gas attack . Blame it on Elmer . I know for a fact he 's laid one or two . Fuming up pungent . Merrily riding down here . In the compartmentof the train . ' What 's that for the sacrifice of saints . ' ' What . ' ' Is there a dead rat . ' ' I beg your pardon . ' ' It 's in the bed it is . ' ' Where . ' ' Gassing me . ' ' It 's Elmer . ' ' Get him away the dirty thing . ' ' Elmer . Out . Down . Naughty . ' ' " That dog has n't a trace of a bit of manners on him .

And further fermented by old cheese and ancient port . The three master minds when they get a moment free from making their snake pit in my house could concoct a pill to purify blasts . That freshly out of the pink expand . And turn a faceless blue in their beauty . The very latest . Just pop it down the throat . For your fragrances . Of fern , lilac or heather . Matched pills for perfume . For evening wear . At one of their operas . Whole audience could come primed with lily of the valley . Making the authenticity of such a smell unforgettable . Rising triumphantly in crescendo from the best bottoms . A unified blast as the curtain comes down . And the clapping hands fan it up to the rafters . One curtain call after another . Could be taken by Rose . Who is growling again . Gyrating and plungingdown on me . Way up her as I am . Between the curious intermissions we 've been having . Like at the saturday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week with the hero 's head on the railway track . And I rushed back with my nickels to see if he would get squashed . As did the noses my father punched . Long after he married a wife who kept coming out of their bedroom wrapped in her kimono telling me to get back down stairs . My father so frequent in rage . Saw him sock a man up against a big grain silo and then put his hand around his throat until the man 's face turned blue just like Mrs L K L. Once a month at least he blew up charging through the house breaking everything in sight . Hissing and steaming . Then banging his fist which went through whatever it landed on . I began to like it better than the movies . Watching through some discreet aperture . Dust rising from chairs . Windows shattering . Lamp shades crushed . That latter was my favourite . And if he could find me I was always good for absorbing a few punches . Sending me aloft across thep71room . Screaming child murder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cellar stairs and squeeze out a window which was too small for him to fit through . And once when he stood in the basement glaring I emptied a pail of water all over him . Into which I had peed before . The chase went up and down cherry trees , over garage roofs and in and out of his three cars . Till he cornered me in a bathroom in the house . And just as he was breaking down the door , the police came charging in . He knew them by name , 11al , Bob , Dick and gave them beer in the kitchen until they could n't stand up . All telling me one by one to behave myself and obey my father . Whose next wife thank God liked me and baked apple pies whenever I wanted them . Which was every day . With a bottle of cream . Followed by spoonfuls of cod liver oil . My palate enjoyed variation . I was a thin but healthy little devil . This new mother was nice . And I was hoping my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been frightened away came back to work for us . To get a stifled laugh one sunday dinner when my father 's rage weakened chair collapsed beneath him and he got showered with a bowl of boiled potatoes . Which Rose might have preferred to the long gone to seed spud she snapped at in her eager hunger . Needed to feed her frenzied energy she uses to grind it right off me . Hold her steady by the great white rear globes . Smooth as mushrooms . Heaving with the remarkable neoarciform described by Erconwald . On her webbed feet she cruised right in to borrow a toiletry . Now she 's calling me Joseph . Might be walking in her sleep . Teeth in my neck . Sinking in . One has that terrible feeling there are eyes in the ceiling . Clarence peeking between the stone vaulting . And yesterdayone moment as I turned to go back in a hallway which headed far beyond my curiosity , I thought I saw someone skip into a room . Any door you might open now could be ap72snakepit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arthritic in the legs . When I graduated from high school she was the only one who came . And when I stood under banners on the gymnasium steps with the wind blowing through my hair , great aunt clapped for me long after everyone else stopped . Till a man said shush and she took her parasol and clonked him one . On childhood sundays she took me in her big car , telling Peter the chauffeur through a microphone which way to turn . To reach my mother 's tomb round a lot of curving cemetery roads . Under a great stone canopy she stood . As a big white piece of chiselled marble in long flowing robes . My aunt said my mother was the most beautiful woman in the midwest . That fine fine profile . And you my boy are going to make something of yourself . Take no nonsense from inferiors and less from superiors and count on being surrounded by crass stupidity for most of your life . And I knew she wanted to add , instead of beating the shit out of innocent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groans . Long and nearly agonized . Flapping around like a fish . On the end of this pole . ' Ah Joseph , Joseph what is it you 've got up in me . ' Do I speak . When I 'm not Joseph . Best to wait for recognition . And meanwhile plan tomorrow 's events . Lick the place into shape . Before some more of it falls on me . Rose digging in her fingernails . She 'll be drawing blood . A little pain drives out the doom . Which after high school , college expulsion , naval training and sales careers , finally closed in on me . My slow suitable decline sent me on a stretcher from auntie 's gabled house in the shady street . And for the first time I saw her quiver . Just as the moon faced grandfatherclock clanged three over her white head . And I passed by supine attempting the merest contorted grin . I was all she had left . And she was all I had . In the formp73of a very small weekly allowance . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tightwad as she was she kept me in a ward . In a wing the other side of the grey pebbled roof top where my mother died . Windows looked out over a canal . Two a.m. was the greatest stillness . When we all lay wondered who was next to go . Wheeled out under a sheet . Before dawn came and gave us another day . Stare up now at the ceiling beaded with moisture . This castle like a vine entwining . Rose is off me and taking a rest . I 'm in an awful state of worry . What if she 's afflicted with something not nice and catching . Which could send me down again only weeks after I 've got up . Elmer asleep . Big shadowy head curled around on his paws . New fiercer winds are lashing cannon ball raindrops . Rose on her back , hands behind her head and elbows stickingin the air , whistling . Elmer wakes , his ears cocking in all directions .

Hardly ever speaks but is a maniac for music . He came down my basement one night when I was rehearsing an aria and stood there at the wall beating his head on it , tears and then blood streaming down his face . Poor man was banished by his family in one of them foreign countries . They send him money once a month to stay away . When it arrives does n't he have a horse cab call and creep out to it in his pyjamas to be taken to the pawn where he redeems his wardrobe , with the likes of a morning suit , silk shirts and whatever else grand continentalgentlemen put on their backs .

Sure I met him in the hall trembling and tearful , a sure sign he could n't be happier . Erconwald says he is an overflowing spring of compassion .

With the three of them sitting there in a row on a bench one hand pulling away possessed and in the other holding stop watches . Did n't they have an innocent little girl out of a convent as an assistant measuring the amount that jumped out into test tubes . The three disgusting pagans . I 'm off for to get the eggs and bacon . Will you have a fried tomato as well . ' Yes please . ' Right you are . ' Four weeks ago tomorrow I stepped off the boat . Rode a train up along a strange bereft shore . Click clacking by estuaries , stopping in small towns . Finally to chug along a flat deserted cold grey coast . Past ruined roofless houses and wintry marshlands . Arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pillars , a dance hall across the street . Rented a room from a big kindly woman . In which I quietly and politely froze . Sitting by the wall at breakfast shivering under her heavy breathing ministrations . I was a stranger stared at wherever I went . Wanderingthe grey wet streets . Looking into a future . Dimmed by the months of dying . Watching from my pillow a youngp77man in the centre aisle of the ward with his precise methodicalways as he declined . Visited every day by a mother who fussed and kissed him and wore big fur collars on her coat . The day before he was rolled away under a sheet lie smiled and played with a jig saw puzzle . That evening I lay still with my eyes closed . Heard choirs singing . Boys in white cassocks trudging over snows with great flaming candles . Their voices rising up in the blue cold skies strewn with colder stars . Watch them . They walk on the endless white . Mountains in the distance . Follow them . Run light footed into wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gently my eyes . And whispers wake with words . Lie safely wound in my arms in peace . All I am is your soul . To gather you . Now . And I knew I was going . Hearingvoices . Nearby my bed . Yes we 're finding it difficult to diagnose , refuses all food , possibly an hysterical condition , lie 's unconscious now , may go into coma . We do n't think he 'll last through tonight . I opened up a lid a crack . Could see three white coated figures and a nurse standing a little away from the foot of my bed . They are talking about me . And it 's touching and comforting that they are . A little group concerned while I live my final moments . I go and they stay . In this great maw of a hospital . Ward of death where the bodies are wheeled in and out . And sometimes screams echoing down the corridors . Sirens of ambulances and police cars in the night . Next to me a man swathed in bandages , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who goes by my bed . Stops and looks at me . Try bravely to smile . She smiles . How are we feeling today . I shake my head . And she would say have you ate anything and I would shake it no again . She said that 's not good . You 've got to eat . Else you wo n't be here anymore . I had then the strength only to raise and lower my hands on the sheet . She would pass on shaking her head . And then twentyp78minutes after midnight which I always knew because a whistle blew on a gasworks across the river canal , the black nurse came , stood over my bed , and looked at me . She said yes that 's what they say , you 're not going to live one more day . That 's not good . That 's bad . So I am going to cure you . Rose coming through the shadows holding a tray of plates and tea pot . A candle making big dark holes out of her eyes . The thump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out this feast in front of us . Packed back in the bed . Grease cooled white on the bacon . Steam rising from the cups of tea . Rose with a slice of bread spread with a slab of butter . Takes up an egg of which there are three on her plate and lays it over the fork and shovels it into her mouth . Followed by the bread and mouthfuls of tea . You know this is grand . Like a hotel . I was in one once . As the guest of the Baron . It had a bathroom not twenty feet away down the hall . I took seven baths . One after the other . Went out of there so clean the skin was nearly off me . The Baron never took a liberty with me . Perfect gentleman he is . For the matter of that I do n't think the Baron has ever taken a liberty with any woman . If he 's got his music he has n't a care in the world . Are n't you going to eat that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough hand it right over here . ' Rose wiped plates and saucers with a piece of bread soaking up tomato seeds , congealed fat and bacon specks . Laughing and growling after the final mouthfuls . A lively strain of organ music in the lulls of the wind . No dull moment in this place . Not even at dawn . Pigs , snakes , barons , scientists and high heeled pieces of arse come floatingdown the halls . Someone may even show up called Boris . Who can play parts not yet cast . And star as a rectum.  |p79In  the final production . And I could end up footing the bill for this original opera . ' I like a snack of an evening . Give us a flash of it . That thing down there . Ca n't I see it showing signs of raising the bed covers off us . ' ' That 's my knee . ' ' You do n't say . ' ' Yes I do . ' ' Well give us a look at your knee then .

What 's wrong with you you wo n't let me see it . Sure the scientists testing the distillate prance around their laboratoryall day with them sticking out . The whole of the population passing down in the street not a stone 's throw away . You 'd wonder if they ever tell their sins to God . Such whoppers that the almighty would be sent mental . Has n't Franz said to me there 's no supreme being . Would you believe that . ' ' Yes . ' ' By God the bunch of them have been right enough about a few things , it makes you think . Do you think there 's a god . ' ' Yes . ' ' Ah thank God of that . I 'm glad to hear it . That Franz would tell you the sky was green and that you could eat it on tuesdays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Curves upwards at you like a banana . Yours seems straight enough . There 's a man in town , now the quietest most elegant well spoken gentleman you could meet , came courtingme . Did n't I think I was right once and for all . The good looks of him would make you faint . Does n't he acceptp80an invitation to come for a little dinner I 'm giving him down in the flooded flat . Embarrassed as I am to meet him at the door with a pair of me brother 's boots to wear . He was lovely . Sits down without a murmur of discontent his feet bunched up in the boots , the water splashing around us . I had the couch propped up on paving stones . Ready for any delight he cared to bestow . A dozen eggs and a pound of rashers we had between us . Like yourself he was shy . I could n't let him turn off the electric as it would throw you dead into the water with a blaze of current . He kept saying could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old stale loaf of bread at the bulb and put us into darkness . I was on the couch . I could hear him wading towards me through the water . And did n't the headlights of a car go by on the street . Well I had a fit when I saw it . He had a thing on him like the prow of a ship . Appropriate at the time . But I said for the love of God you 're not going to put the likes of that into me , I 'd be kilt . Had n't the words got out of my mouth before I could stop myself . The poor gentleman was mortified . God he was handsome . Must have happened to him many times before . That he had to get at you in the dark before you could object . Have n't I often wondered had he got at me with it first would I have known . I do n't mind them thick or on the long side but when they 're the like of that as would plough you in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can tell you when I came with the news to the three of them were n't they into white coats in a flash , ripping instruments out of the drawers and racing out the laboratory door like they were going to a fire . In no time they had your man housed in the best hotel , giving him the treat of his life while they were at him with the stop watches , weighing and measuring and pouring distillate and copious beers down your man 's throat . You would n't know but that thep81bunch of them were turning into homosexuals . You 'd hear nothing else out of them but the specifications and performanceof your man 's tool . All in a special book with a blue ribbon . How long it took to get up , come off , go down , get up again in the various temperatures , times of day and phases of the moon . Till your man broke down in tears and wept , a nervous residue . Now that 's a handy size I do n't mind saying . Built for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sure as I 'm feeling it what harm is it to see it . ' All right . ' ' It must be studded with jewels . Grrrrrr . Ah fondly seen by moonlight . Grrrrrr . You have a beautiful prick . Make a grand dessert . ' Rose is at me . Finishing off her supper with a nibble . And now a mouthful . Of the end of my pole . Take it as a radish , take it as a leek . But by God do n't gobble it off altogether and make me a freak . Plough acres around Charnel Castle to keep you fed . Grow a few tons of onions too . For the others . The land raging forth with cabbages and spuds would bring in some revenue . Might make ends meet . Just as easily die here as in the hospital . Fading away in the night when nurse said I am going to cure you . The shadows rearing as she pushed the green screens up around my bed , pulled back the covers and put her hand gently tickling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad way but we 're going to cure you starting right now tonight before you do any more of this dying . Do you hear . You come back now walking on that road . You can do it . Her whispers reaching quietly into my ears . From this dark slender girl . A little silver watch on her wrist she watched when she held mine . I felt all those first days she might not like me . Till she said you 're a model patient not a request or a complaint . I gave her all my tropical fruit . Just to leave with someone something . If only spatp82out seeds . Little pips . In memory . I had no visitors but one old school friend who thought I had got strange . And after a few sour fading smiles he walked away with my temperaturechart caught on his coat . Which clattered to the floor at the swing door of the ward . And then she came . On duty every night at seven . Her uniform sparkling white . Her big long lashed eyes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my penis . More lightly and lovely than light or love . Till just after half past twelve my pecker came up . A slow fire from a tiny spark kissed into me . She was called April and wore glasses when she read my thermometer . My heart was thumping . Her lips soft wind blowing . A tune played with music tip toeing up my spine . Carrying little tinkling silver chains . Winding them round in bundles . Attached up to a ship . A naval vessel I once saw ready for launching . The great wooden supports knocked away . Taking the thighs off my hips and banging them on my ears I come awake . Bottle of champagne crashing against the bow . People running scattering through the brain . The ship moves . Slowly . Faster now . Rose please . Not so hard . April blew like a mystery . Never solved in the shadows she sweetly beat into billowing flames . The drag chains on the ship swept away in great clouds of rusty dust . Bells pounding . Sirens blaring . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water . And I was floating too . April 's hand over my mouth as I groaned out with life from all the beds of dying . Where she left me . So tenderly that night . A kiss on my cheek and warm honeyed milk licked from her fingers . Dripping down my throat . Healing . Brought to me by her long slender brown hands . She had a husband . Who had gone off to die . Somewhere along the miles of dirty pavementsunder the elevated train . She met him every afternoon . Where he sat on a bench waiting . She came withp83milk , chicken pie , cole slaw and ham . His favourite foods . His face lighting up with a smile and they went to a little park to sit by a tree , throwing crumbs to squirrels and she 'd tuck his napkin in and try to bring him back to life . Each time she left him saying goodbye at the bus stop , tears in both their eyes because she knew one time she would come and there 'd be no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five hours she waited and waited . Till it was dark and she was late for duty . That day the next day and next . Sitting the hot afternoon pestered by drunks , a hoarding of a vacant lot behind her , a big hand holding up an enormous glass of beer . She gave the food away to men just able to lift up their heads and say thank you . Each midnight the screens up around the bed she blew me . Fed me more warm milk and honey soaked pieces of bread . Within a week I had the strength to grab but not hold her and she laughed and said this is treatment and you must n't touch . I wrote out in big letters on a piece of paper . Thank youFor eating me The wayYou doShe folded the tidings up and put it in a little pocket over her breast and shook her finger at me . She said you 're going to talk again too but comments like that are taboo . I could peel an orange now and chew an apple . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my hand flat on the earth . Watch flowers grow up between my fingers . The doctors came with raised eyebrows . Shaking their heads up and down . Wondering why I was n't out there a turning left off the hall and down a long ramp where they put the chilled banked up bodies . Rose I 'm coming . Should I callp84you Josephine . Instead of the April I remember night and day . With her trim legs and the agony simmering in me when I saw her put hand to another forehead or read another chart or smile at another face . I swore on a clean sheet of paper to her that I would go into a further decline . Unless she took less time visiting the other beds and stayed with me . Rose . I 'm coming . In April . When she blew me at midnight and again at dawn . I was eating steak then . She took a piece of paper and wrote in letters I thought far bigger than were necessary . You Are CuredI wrote back . Like hell I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are . I left just before Christmas . She tied the knot of my tie and fixed a hanky in my pocket upon which she wiped a tear . It was a morning . She was off duty in a light grey suit , and light blue sweater . I would start dying again just to touch her breasts . Said she stopped in to see me go . To make sure I did n't give her another wrestling match that night . And I went . Out the long dismal green corridor of haunting chemical smells . And hugged her goodbye as I got into a taxi . And now I come . In her memory . Wherever she is . Waiting by the big glass of beer . Near the train which thunders by . A brown girl who gave a kiss of white life to me . Coaxed up seed to sow . Some gone now gruntingly swallowed . By Rose . Strength seeping out of my legs . Her hand feeling in among my balls . During inquisition , please take it easy . Spheroids of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between forefinger and thumb . Or one held while the other two are squeezed for authenticity . April specially took out her glasses when perusing that part of my case history . Evenp85though I was dying I smiled . As Rose comes up for air . Big buxom thing from under the covers on her hands and knees . Smacking her lips . Swinging those breasts . Could smother you . Quite pleasantly . As I get reported to the scientists . For having three . Estimated by Rose . Be invited to an hotel . Disrobe please . We have with us our adding machine . Just like the guy who came navigating his stupendous prow into port over the cellar waters . She is amazed . How many balls do you have . I 'm going out of my mind down there counting .

The sea 's blue slow thundering swells creep in . And rise up on the cliffs and spread a ribbon of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grazing the other side of the fence and gave me a red baleful eye . And shook a ring in his nose . Watched him chew and then bow his head down to a patch of clover again . Elmer went up to sniff . To leap back from a swift hook of Toro 's horn . Sunny and breezy out this morning . Nearly as if last night was not yet until tomorrow . Clementine strolling along the headland . On a narrow path worn by the edge of the steep cliff . Grey rocks jutting out over the heaving water far below . Look back southeast , the castle turrets loom stacked up against the distant clouds . Percival said would he run up the standard now that I was in residence . I thought what the hell why not . And it flutters red green brown and gold . The upheld crimson hand looking particularly well against the sky . Take a little leap I think in the air . Clang my heels together chirpish and chipper . Climbing up the stony hillside to the haunted black lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's got tired crouching and is now standing up sticking out over that rock as barefaced as he was born if that 's how he got here . This new day starts up the spirit 's engines again.  |p87Wave  at Clarence . He does nothing . But stare . Send by semaphore the word ahoy . He turns and gallops away . As I dip my hand in this water and find it impenetrably black and deathly cold . Clementine wandering through what Percival said was the lady 's garden . A sun dial sticking up out of a thicket of nettles and briar . Through a cloistered passage and beyond an iron gate an orchard , thronged by grey thistle stalks and lichen covered branches wildly sticking in the sky . A great domed glass house out from the castle wall . Inside the shadows of tropical trees , palms and ferns . All locked in combat for space and life . And above , more castle battlements , tiny window slits behind which anything could be happening . When I crossed the landing over the great hall this morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coat with a stethoscope hanging round his neck . Giving me shudders . And passing out the courtyard door l saw Tim with bulging bags from a laden cart slung over each shoulder heading for the kitchen entrance . I put my hands over my eyes . To cover up the sight of the expense . Suppose they only want to see me have plenty of everything . Then Percival peeking in at breakfast time asked if all was to my satisfaction . It took a moment to answer . As I could still feel the feel of Rose 's big pillowy body . And the reddened bruised grip of her teeth on my one eyed snake . She departed late dawn in a fit of coughing . Breasts shaking and nipples bouncing all over her chest . Great rumbles down in the lungs and one of her fits made me back away and trip over my pail of slop water promptly drenching my stockinged feet . While Elmer encouraged by the chaos chewed into the mattress and dug a hole with a pair of churning huge paws distributing clumps of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make it look lived in . By a dog.  |p88Moist  breeze watering my eyes . Press a hand on the ground . Grass and tiny white sheltering little flowers . A bug goes by . Asked Percival this morning what on earth does one do with all these rooms . He said put them out of your mind , sir . Time enough to think of them if you need one . But watch where I 've marked the lines . Tim and I were n't we looking for the pig who 'd do grand for tomorrow 's table and did n't we think we had him cornered when we find the shape of him gone downwards through the timbers just up the two doors from her ladyship 's room . Ah sir we investigated below and had n't he gone as well clean through the old flower room by the conservatory , helping himself no doubt to the baby rats there , they be a great delicacy for pigs . And Ena now will sew back them stuffings into your bed and you wo n't miss a wink of sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Percival . And speak of him and here he comes running . ' Ah sir I 've been looking everywhere for you . There 's a gentleman and his wife calling . They are from over there beyond . Neighbours as you might say . I said you were out for a stroll . ' I went back with Percival to the great hall . Where the two folks stood . A chunky , blood red haired man slapping a riding crop against his britches . And a tall willowy girl with long brown tresses , a hunting hat in hand knocking it against the side of her black gleaming boot . ' I say I 'm sorry old chap to barge in like this but my wife and I were passing , could n't help but see your flag flying . ' ' O. ' ' Jolly good . The old place has got some life again . See you 've got your man hard at work there . That 's the way to shore up those old foundations . Dig down deep . Put it back in shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p89How  do you do .

Your ancestors and my ancestors used to shove spears up each other 's arses . We were always out trying to cut the gems off a Clementine , what about that . ' I know little about the family history . As a matter of fact I 've just moved in . ' Well by God we 'll knock glasses together and have some sport . Gail and I just cantered over the hill .

' ' My grand aunt . ' ' 0 I 'm most awfully sorry . You know how people are . By God they 'd claim the honour of an uncle being booted up the hole by an earl . I do n't mean to belittle your aunt old boy . I say there Gail , look , that 's great uncle Bubbly , the whole ruddy hunt . Must be fifty years ago . I say you do n't mind my asking a personal question but where do you get all your staff . By God they leap out at you from everywhere . Some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settling in .

Too many letting the standards fall down around their soiled ruddy ankles . Had an accident old boy . ' Yes . ' Want to watch these old drapes . When I was engaged to Gail here and getting on the good side of the family to get my hands on some of their ruddy millions . ' Really Jeffrey . ' It 's the truth my dear girl . I did n't have a pot to piss in . And I was at the end of a long reception line , bloody family going through their stuffy formalities . I thought I 'd sit down on a chair behind me , roped off it was , well I put aside the rope and sat down , damn chair went to dust beneath me old boy , and I made a grab for a tapestry just behind to save myself from a broken arse .

A gold pin and pearl in the silk white scarf at her throat and a sparkle in her light blue eyes . She lifts her chin and displays a delicate adam 's apple as Nails pulls down a book . ' Many 's the time as a little chap I went searching in these damn tomes looking for smut . Got my nose into those geographical magazines , the tits on those blacks standing around their camp fires in flagrant ruddy nudity . Could n't wait to get out of sight of my nannie to have a good beat off . ' Please Jeffrey . ' Old Clementine here 's a man of the world . Is n't that right . ' Well I think so .

Even Gail there got a little saucy , pranged her on the way home in the carriage over the back seat . ' Jeffrey .

Standing beside her father , a big red nosed old bastard . I knew he was rotten with it , knew the drink would knock him off , and the whole fortune held in trust for Gail would tumble into my yawning coffers . Never missed the opportunity to nudge the old boy 's elbow to help along when he was knocking back a whiskey . All a man needs is a mare to plug and a few grazing beasts and spuds . This is excellent port . You must come and see us . Do n't stand on ceremony . In fact why not tonight . Bring your better half with you . ' I have n't got one . ' What , no mare .

Through which the exprisoners were passing carrying a large potted tropical palm . Lady Macfugger raising one eyebrow which lowers as Elmer shoves his big black nose deep between the cheeks of her arse , giving her person a push forwards . Stop it Jeffrey . ' Was n't me sweetie .

The Macfuggers mounting two monstrous gleaming black hunters . A rifle and shot gun strapped to Nails Macfugger 's saddle . And with hooves clattering and slipping on the stone cobbles , they smile , wave , and thunder off galloping down the roadway . Percival laid out my clothes , a rather outsize dinner suit belonging to my father , a crumpled silk shirt , evening shoes and a pair of dark green socks . As the Macfuggers left I saw Rose out of the corner of my eye on the great hall landing . She stood glaring her upraised fists clenched . Returning to the castle I heard distant doors slamming . The three exprisoners , the Baron and Mr and Mrs L K L in the library . All bent over tomes . I went searching for some privacy . Found a likely vaulted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passage .

Indeed I hope you will not think it ill of me to make immediately a temporary amend . ' Erconwald standing his hands folded in front of him . Tears in his eyes . Ledgers open on a great oak table . Walls covered with axes , coils of fire hose and pram like vehicles supporting red water tanks . Erconwald reaching into hisp97trouser pocket . Taking forth a wad of white bank notes . Peeling them off and holding them forth . ' What 's this . ' ' For the unforgivable inconvenience we have caused you . Pray take it . It is offered merely as the merest of compensations . From the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not refuse this pathetic token . ' Clementine taking the money . Erconwald bowing . The afternoon light fading across the high barred windows smothered in cobwebs . And hanging from the far wall are shackles and chains . An open cupboard with black jackets and leather gaiters . ' I am pleased kind person . It has been unfortunate for me that I have been many times disappointed . In both science and love . One of my very earliest attempts at romance was unhappy . I pursued for three months a young lady whose figure I thought to be quite robust . My desire for her was extremely feverish . And one evening while attaching a flower to her bosom , in my nervousness I pushed the pin deeply into her breast . She did not complain , indeed she smiled , and my most earnest hopes were dashed . Upon , if I may say , the level surface of her chest . And kind sir it does not escape me that Rose looks upon you with favour . I would only humbly ask that if your intentions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And I speak no further . Please . Come here . To this door . With your indulgent permission which we hope to seek , we have made a peep hole . See . There they are . ' ' Holy heifer . ' ' The one in your palm tree you will see extends its body out more than half its length . Note the exquisite stillness it possesses . Yet in an instant that delicate small green head can bring death . The specimen lying coiled on the right isp98an older specimen . Unfortunately agitated at the moment and one can not enter . ' Erconwald 's impenetrable courtesy . From a little pocket casket he offers me a cheroot . His white long delicate fingers closed over the dark fibres . His emerald glowing mamba green . He waits ready to administer a kindness wherever the opening yawns . Might be found at any street corner shepherding old ladies in an ever constant stream across the roadway . Good person might my associates and I be permitted to examine your testicles . ' Wait a minute . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minute . ' ' Ah I do understand your quite natural hesitation to grant scrutiny of your gonads . But I assure you it will be entirely painless and conducted with every dignity that such an exploration might require . ' Who told you about my testicles . ' ' Ah , it is good person , a rumour we have heard . We merely want to measure and weigh , and should it be necessary , to tabulate as well . ' I 've not even found my feet in this place and you guys are trying to count my balls . ' Permit me kind sir . ' Erconwald putting aside his sweet scented cheroot and undoing his trousers . Frowning as a button pops off and rolls in a circle on the stone floor to disappear down a drain hole . What are you doing . ' Good person I am displaying to you my own organs of regeneration so that you should not think me unmindful of another 's trepidation in doing so . ' ' Please stop . '  |p99'Would  it not help for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' ' No . ' ' I am distressed that I have failed to reassure you . ' Clementine backing towards the door . Erconwald 's fly wide open . Might have an apparatus quite out of the ordinary . Coils up and strikes like one of his snakes . Seems like years ago I sat alone cold and damp in the library thumbing through the ledgers . Pages of inventories flashingby , the Porcelain Room , Pump Room , South Cloisters , Verandah and by the look of this one I 'm trying to get out of , it must be a combination guard room and fire department . Adjoining what is now the snake pit . ' Please Erconwald do n't get upset . I just ca n't see that anything can be gained by your showing me your privates . I 've always been unreasonably shy about exhibiting my own . I think a little girl playmate may have laughed at them once , something like that . But good lord if you feel t hat way about it , show me . ' ' Thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his trousers and lifting up shirt tails to uncover a large and somewhatengorged copulatory machine and pair of balls . I I is privates with an athletic quality about them absent from the delicate rest of his person . How long is one required to look . Ca n't see this gives me the nerve to flash mine . Clementine turning as the door behind squeaks open . A head peering in . Of a strange female face . A lady of riper years in a thick white wool sweater over a flowered skirt of a dress . Her smooth skin and wet lips . A smile breaking on her face as she looks from Erconwald 's privates to the raised eyebrows of Clementine . ' Ooo . I 'm awfully sorry . Do carry on . Sorry , I mean top100say I was just looking for someone . Who might help me . As I am completely stranded about two miles from here without petrol . But I beg your pardon . Clearly I 'm intruding .

Most embarrassing to witness during this stranger 's conversation Erconwald 's private protuberancehorizontally stiffening out and jumping up and down between his stripey green , blue and white shirt tails . ' Well , wo n't you say something someone . I know this is cruelly embarrassing but good lord I do n't know my way out . Please help me . A gallon of petrol would get me to the next town . I 'm on my way to visit friends . Please believe me I had no intention of barging in this way . Into what is clearly a very private moment .

I know I seem to be persisting here at the door but quite honestly I 'm covered in mud and have been scratched with briars in my struggle to get in here at all . I 'm really feeling quite wretched .

' ' Simply awful to gatecrash like this but honestly I am at my wits ' end . I tried one door and fell down steps . I heard water below . It quite has frightened me. '  |p101Erconwald  attempting to get his penis back into his grey flannel trousers tugging them up and turning away from the visitor . Buttoning above and below the projecting waving organ while stepping backwards and stumbling into a fire apparatus . The lady visitor pushing back on her forehead a wave of greyed blonde hair which keeps falling . I 'm going to make a run for it . Taste blood on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' I 'll be back .

' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a total stranger intruding as well as I believe , trespassing . ' ' Well folks , please , I 'll just run off now . And be back shortly . ' Clementine heading south along the passage . Towards darkness and a door at the end . Opening out into the great hall . Saw a dangling rope of a clapper to a fire bell one could have pulled . Announcing to the castle a viewing of an erection . Ring in series of two and continuep102until assistance arrives . Whole mob could have descended . Upon Erconwald 's prick upended . The recent elevation measured by Franz . To fire salvos at a growling Rose dancing in strangling poses among the mambas . As the rest of the household assembles and sambas . And all maybe later to scrimmage awhile . ForThe circus ContinuesMore crazy than cruelOne of us nowWill spin like a topOn the end Of his toolp103Clementine hastily through the door under the grand staircase . Could get lost going down these steps . The air colder . Which way . To the kitchens . Of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this white door . Explore while one is on the way . Give Erconwald ample time to get it back into his trousers . And out of the sight d that woman who has a rather musical laughter . Which might keep Erconwald 's pecker up till the cows come home . Or he gets blown . A room the walls lined with cupboards from floor to ceiling . Barred windows peeking out on the courtyard . Shelves with earthenware pots . Cloves , cinnamon , bay leaves . A spice room . The scientists could add seasoning to the distillate . Of which Erconwald must slam back a dram for breakfast . Get it to pop up and poke the stranded lady right on the red bump on her nose . Between pretty blue eyes . Which will sparkle throughout the eight or nine years of good screwing she must have left . Tonight my first social engagement . And I 'm searching for petrol . To motor a matron out of this menagerie . Clementine pushing through another door . A large candle lit room , round stone pillars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , chains and skewers . Along a wall a vast black cast iron stove . Batteriesp104of pans hanging on racks . A girl catching her breath . As she turns suddenly with a dripping ladle in her hand . ' Lord save us . ' ' I 'm sorry to barge in . I 'm looking for Percival . ' ' Sir I do be thinking he is down the tunnel doing a bit of fishing , sir . ' ' I do n't believe I know who you are . ' ' I 'm from beyond sir , a friend of Imelda . She asked me to give her a hand and I 'm after stirring up the soup for tonight 's dinner . A gentleman was down before with the onions to put in the cauldron . We have this hour before been trying to prise the pig loose from the darknesses beyond in the tunnels and into the pot , Imelda and Mary are after him this minute . ' ' Fine . ' ' Is there anything now I can do for you sir . ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clementine stopping in the spice room . One comes away from that confrontation trembling in every limb . A girl of flowing dark hair . Slender white arms from the blue rolled up sleeves of her sweater . Go back and ask her name . One more mortal on the staff . An incredible beauty found down in the cellars . Move her higher up in the castle to stardom . ' I 'm sorry to trouble you again . ' ' Ah it 's no trouble . ' ' But I do n't know your name . ' ' Charlene . ' ' Ah . That 's a nice name . ' ' It is after me grandmother 's . She worked here in the castle her whole life , died out beyond there in the laundry room by the stables where she lived her last fifteen years , never did she stir out of it till they took her in her coffin , she was fond of the warmth from the few heated pipes . Shep105loved folding the linens and stacking them in the airing cupboards that you would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Are you permanently here . ' ' I would n't know sir . I would be thinking that you would be the one to say sir . ' ' I hope you 've heard that I may not be able to get around to steady wages but I think I can manage to reimburse you now and again . Would this be enough for the moment . ' Clementine pulling the wad from Erconwald out of his pocket . Charlene wiping her hand on a thick grey skirt and taking the large white bill . Holding it out pinched by her hand , a little dirt under her worn fingernails . ' Sir there 's no need to give me this . What use have I for it with pucks to eat and a place to sleep . ' ' You 're staying in the castle . ' ' I am sir . I have my own room above . ' ' Ah . ' ' It suits me fine . I am crowded with me family with seven little brothers and sisters . We only have the one room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times to get a night 's sleep with the scratchings and kickings . ' Boots and thick brown stockings on Charlene 's legs . She smiles when she talks with white teeth which look like her own . A little mole next to her nose . Castle full of surprises . jammed with arrivals . Those summoned by morse code and others crawling through briars . Wake up out of haunted death throes on one side of the ocean and gallivant with big bosomed ravenous dolls on the other . Charlene 's are from the bulges in her sweater of refined proportions . ' The soup smells good . ' ' It 's only a few old ingredients put boiling in a pot , same u we do at home . I 'll be bringing you some fish tomorrow  |p106when  my father comes in with the boat . Do you like fish sir . ' ' Yes . ' ' Would you like it fried . ' ' That would be nice .

' ' Do n't you find it gloomy down here in the dark . ' ' Not at all . Sure I 've never been fond of the outdoors lashed by the wind and the rain . With the stove going it 's nice enough here . ' Clementine taking one last sip of this delicate creature . A tiny figure under the massive stone ceilings . Alone down in these damp endless cellars . Got to save her from that kind of life . And fix up some light duties nearer my apartments . ' I wonder Charlene if you could direct me to the tunnel where Percival is fishing . ' ' Surely sir , it 'll just require a candle or two . Now if you come this way . Past the spice room and the downstairs pantry . ' Charlene opening a thick oak door into a room . More shackles on the walls . Under an archway and down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A stone alcove with two iron gratings in the floor . ' Down there sir are the dungeons . They be an awful dangerous place . They put them poor creatures down into them on a ladder and you could n't get out with a lifetime of trying . The sea waters get into the lower ones , full of dead bones . They would shovel the food down to them through the bars there . With them fighting over it among themselves and the rats . '  |p107The  tunnel slanting downwards . Wet stones slippery under foot . The walls glistening with beads of moisture . The sound of waters and low whine of the wind . The candles wavering , Charlene 's hand up sheltering the flame . Poor Erconwald only wanted to inspect my balls and ends up with his own apparatus on display . ' Now sir , hold tight along here to the rail . There 's more steps . There now you can see the bit of daylight ahead . ' A blue expanse of sea . Headlands and coast rising to the north . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut from rock , moorings twisted and rusting . No sign of Percival . ' I would n't want sir to be causing needless worry but it 's a long fall to the sea and it would n't be the first time a soul had been dragged into the deep by the monster that lurks down there in the water . ' The wind blowing Charlene 's wavy tresses back from her soft white skinned face . A pair of eyes bright blue . She bites lips red and moist . Her hands and wrists pink with chill . She stands on a step gripping an old twisted railing in the rock and leans out to look down . ' There 's not a sign of him , you could n't be at the bottom there in the thrashing of them waves and ever get back up here alive . God forbid that he went into that deep to be torn to pieces by the conger . ' ' He could have fallen . ' ' Yanked would be the case . ' ' We 'd better go for help . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir , all he needs now is a bit of blessing as you would give to any soul of the faithful departed . He was a holy terror in his early days with the ladies but these last few days he 's made amends enough . Often I 've seen him on the bicycle helter nkelter to do his spiritual duty . As the years edge themp108closer to the hammer and tongs of God they soon enough get down on their knees and make friends with the on high , offering him cigarettes , mea culpas , hiccups , coughs and greasy pennies . ' ' I see . ' Sure if he was injured we 'd see him impaled below . And if he 's been made a meal of by the conger you can forget attending to the remains . ' Charlene leads Clementine back in the tunnel . Past the dungeons , up the spiral stairs , through the pantry and kitchens and by a back passage and servants ' hallway to a narrow door opening into the antechamber of the Octagonal Room . Put hands up over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Percival . Dead out there on the water . Charlene said she would search through the castle . With Miss Ovary and Oscar and Imelda . One waits . Momentarily out of the castle traffic . And where is Elmer . Someone pounding on the door . Come in . ' Excuse me sir but so far there is n't a sign of Percival . But we 've come upon goings on that would make the devil himself blush with shame . Sure God there is the old fire department in flames you might say with impurity . A gentleman in no fit state to be seen . Inviting us in he did . The manners on him would make you think he was asking us to a ball . Miss Ovary has run out sir beyond screaming she 'd have nothing to do with the likes of the goings on . Said she did that snakes had landed upon us . I 'd say she suffered hallucinations brought on by your man not taking a proper attention to his dress . Can I get you anything now . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I say something . ' Please do . ' Well if Miss Ovary does not come back as she was say/ing , is it in order if I take over in the kitchens . She 'll have nothing to do with men and we are besieged down there by gentlemen jumping out at us from behind the pillars and waiting in the scullery . Would it be proper for me to tell them to hop it . ' ' Yes of course . ' ' Now sir I believe in speaking me mind . The bunch here are eating you out of house and home and not one of them lifting a finger to so much as pour their own tea . Sure one of them a beast of a woman was down there in the kitchen the middle of the night frying up rashers and eggs enough for an army , ordering me out of the way when I was trying to get the morning fires going . Are you all right sir . Is your head bothering you . ' ' Just a little pain behind my eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , let me put this wet cloth to you . ' Charlene putting a compress on Clementine 's forehead . Smell the moist thick wool of her skirt . Hear a clatter of wheels out over the countryside . One lies still with the lids down to receive this tender attention . Far off tomorrows . Please come . Without servants drowning . Our guests whipping out their tools . Have n't the fortitude to go back down there and tell this lady there 's no sign of Percival never mind petrol . One 's head about to explode . Must stop myself sliding into decline . Already stretched out on a bed . Always a bad moment . When the first compressesget put to the brow . Just what I did in auntie 's house , the pale light out those three windows overlooking the street . The squeal of the post box on the telephone hole at night when someone mailed a letter . Sending hello through midnight hands , stamped and sealed , tucked incubby holes , sliding down chutes , speeding over land . Please do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Percival have next of kin . ' ' Not a soul sir as far as I know is belonging to him . ' ' If we find his body there will have to be a funeral . ' ' No problem . Sean the blacksmith in the town will knock up a box . Sure you have your own cemetery out there read for him . Wash him down with a few bottles of whiskey . There 's an awful chill here now . I 'll light up these few pieces of turf and put some warmth into things . Sir , it 's the bell in the courtyard someone must be at the front door , shall I see to it . ' ' Please . ' To stare up at the ceiling where a black beetle crawls . Could feel Charlene 's breath on my face , sweet and warm . Read in an etiquette book that cohabitation with servants breeds insolence leading to the eating of the master 's smoked salmon and the liberal downing of his potables . And even to shot gun blasts . Dare the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Wanted to reach up and drag Charlene down . I am enamoured of your eyes . Globes of one sort leading to globes of another . Arse white as the cheeks of her face . Like two lamps lit outside auntie 's house . The bugs bombarded all night . When terror went crouching through the streets . Citizens shot dead on lawns for wallets . And when I could walk fast after I was cured I packed the gladstone bags . Booked on a steamship line and took the train to the coast . Nearly ran on the thick echoing boards down the pier shed . Auntie for six months of every year for five years lived on a ship . Said she liked the routine . Man in a little green kiosk stamped my passport . Seagulls wheeling and screeching overhead . Sailors lifting hawsers off capstans . Ship gave a whistle blast . Auntie said it 's the kind of world which will suit you over there . Give you something to fight for . Keep up your standards . They were serving tea in the garden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An ancient ship with narrow bows . I sat alone at a table . Saw a girl with blond curly hair and powdery blue eyes who smiled . I thought my God this is going to be swell . And never saw her again . She lay deathly sea sick down in the bowels of the ship the whole voyage . Three hours out we were hit by a hurricane . The seas rose up black watery mountainsin the darkness . The stern where I clutched looking out through the lashing spray went up and down like an elevator . Giant propellers rising from the water , shaking and trembling the vessel . I stood bundled in my racoon skin coat . Death finished stalking me on land . Now dancing with it up and down the ocean waves . Two potted palms stood either side of the restaurant entrance . A sandy haired gentleman sat across from me at my table , seating fourteen . Passengers one by one making runs for the nearest bucket . One little boy heaving right out on the table . Twelve bewildered ashen green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had an appetite . Polished off twelve plates of smoked salmon . Giving me a shy smile and bow of the head as he swept another helping on his plate . I wrote him a short note explaining that I had temporarily lost my voice . He again nodded and smiled . Asked if I played chess . He was an impetuous player , overflowing with confidence . Slowly with a positioning of knights and bishops I annihilated him . Prior to some final moments in these blood baths he would leap to his feet and pace the decks outside to revive his strategy with fresh sea air . Iu s aggressiveness in early moves always decided me to not let him win . The few passengers who could still walk on the tilting ship crowded round . Amateur chess masters gave him advice from an elbow . Still the slaughter continued . Still he rose and raced to the fresh air outside , slapping his cheeks and shaking his head . To return andp112with grimaces preceded by indulgent smiles he 'd move his queen into the attack . Caboom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal interior of his bishop . And his fists would clench and whiten . At one moment I thought he was going to reach across and take my silent neck into his hands and prevent me from ever taking up residencein auntie 's castle . Instead he leaped to his feet and gavotted in silent hysterics across the room . Later in the second class lounge up by the ship 's smokestacks he became a sympathetic companion happily quaffing pints of bitter beer . He said he had tried his luck in the new world and been bested . Wore his shoes out looking for work . Stuffed newspapers to stop the soles of his feet from burning on the hot pavements . He said everyone aboard the ship had been bested by the new world . And were now being thrown deathly ill to the decks vomiting . Half the crew were out of action . And the captain put into port . While we waited below a town once levelled by an explosion . A fort up on a hill overlooking the harbour . I went ashore with this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services . He borrowed a coin from me to put in the passing collectiontray . Some strange sadness took me and I felt tears running down my face . World so lonely . Voices in song . Raised in thanksgiving . Off key I croaked out a note or two . In transit between lands . Tiptoeing between the gouging , testicle kicking greed . Had I but just a house and lawn . Sit in during the snowy winters . Lie out in a hammock by summers . But when I came out of the navy the dirty bastards said they had an opening in the stock exchange . Running messages . And something in my father came out in me . I stood up from my seat at the interview and said come on you god damn pen pusher put up your dukes . Mr Clementine he said , are you out of your senses . He wore glasses , his hair cut short and sticking up all overp113his head . He was no shoulders and all hips . I felt sure violence would upset him . He said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unsuitable for the position . That summer I spent at the beach . Sifting the sand through my toes . Clocking in at an hotel along the shore . To drink tinkling glasses amid dreams of how the world should always be . Told in words brave . Agreed with nods solemn . And fairness for patrons of this bar above all . Not a bad guy here . The piano player is really president of a big corporation . What can you do but just play along . With the graft . Down down the steps to the lonely boarding house room . But hope to die first at a cotillion in the last second of a treasured moment caught at the end of an elegant woman 's voice , is n't he , that man , the masterful one , is n't he the cat 's whiskers . Madam not only that but I have three balls to chime . Should you like . To hear bells . Or just feel . Balls . ' Sir it 's a four in hand to take you to Mr and Lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' The lady out of petrol standing in the great hall at the edge of Franz 's excavation in the corner . Turns with a girlish twirl at the sound of my footsteps . Charlene kept her eyes averted and retreated to the antechamber as I dressed . Pumped galloping flames into the fire with a long handled bellows . Steamed my socks with the heat . Cooled again when put over my ice cold feet . A little elegance upon the person buoys the spirit . Needed to face the lady out of petrol . Last confronted across the pale pole of Erconwald . ' I 'm awfully sorry but my man Percival is missing . We fear the worst . ' ' O that 's quite all right . As a matter of fact it is rather a strange coincidence . I understand you are on your wayp114to the Macfuggers . Actually it 's precisely where I was going . And if you would n't mind , perhaps I could come along and pick my car up later . My name 's Veronica as a matter of fact . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coats . Gleaming windows of the carriage . Clementine climbing aboard after this woman who had a rather musky smell . The darkening day and Rose standing glaring from a parapet . Poor Elmer downcast as I closed the door against his big black nose . Pall of doom . Percival gone . ' As a matter of fact I 'm an old friend of the Macfuggers . But apropos of nothing at all do you mind if I ask , who are you . ' ' Me red skin . ' ' What . ' ' Me from tribe . ' ' I do n't think I follow you . ' ' Me brave . ' ' Are you having me on . Good lord this contraption is rather uncomfortable . Driver , you out there , do please be more careful . ' ' Yes madam . ' ' They are the limit you know , these natives . Impossible to impart manners to . Several louts standing about in a village refused to push my car to get it started . Of course I do enjoy it when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pubs . At least they keep each other down . Sexually of course they are extremely interesting . I quite like the ring of sun around farm labourers ' necks . It does more for me than I can say . But you appear to be inclined towards having your little games with male companions . As a matter of fact our brief encounter today is the very type of thing I most fancy , I hope I do n't embarrass you , but that 's an awfully cute penis on your friend . I wanted to photographp115it for my album . He was so pleased . Said he has a laboratoryback in town with details concerning a gentleman 's organ quite outsize . One always hears of these men but never meets them . Why do n't they come knocking on my door . I 'm divorced from my first husband . He was in the Colonial Service . We often went on elephants up into the hills . What whoppers they 've got . But they 're a far more comfortable journey than this . ' Mountains rising up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sea . Horses ' hooves clattering on the stony rutted road . Brown bog lands . Heather and gorse . Tiny spots of yellow flowers . Spring lies somewhere . Hiding butterflies who will skip over the countryside . Rain streaks the carriage glass . Breezes blow up through the floor . My chess playing friend aboard the ship had a gallon of wine in his cabin . He often asked who I was . Said he suspected me of being a deposed monarch and that I would not speak again until I got back on my throne . I grew to like him and chalked in his name as victor of the ping pong competition . He won by default as no one could stand up to play . Tug boats guided us through the channel when we set sail out of the port to ride the great swells of the sea . Still lashed by the tail of the hurricane . And down went the passengers into their bunks again .

I think my body might amaze you . Sorry if I 'm being tactless . I 'm simply mad about pricks . You rich young men are all alike . I hope you 're not sitting there being smug . While I just go on talking . You 've hardly said a word . I think you 're awfully pretentious . Me red skin , me from tribe , me brave . How dare you . I 'm not attacking you.  |p116But  I suppose you spend your time with all those lovely young innocent things who 've never had a cock in their mouths in their lives . Precious little buttercups shepherded by their mothers . How dare you own that marvellous castle . How dare you . ' Madam I 've just got out of hospital . My great aunt gave me the castle to recuperate in . I 'm trying to make a new life for myself . ' I 'm sorry , I had no idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' I love cats you know . I detest your dog . That great ugly monster . ' I do n't mind what you say about me but please do n't insult my dog . ' The very wrong people are getting the upper hand these days .

Do you know that my ancestors have been officers in the Colonial Service for more than three generations . ' I 'm sorry I did n't know . ' It 's not that I need it known , I 'll have you know . ' Rocking swaying and bouncing , horses churning hooves as the carriage mounts these hills . Galloping around turns , crashing over ruts . By barren bog lands . Sheep running from the path of the rumbling vehicle . Veronica with her legs crossed . A strong pair of hands folded in her lap . A sweet perfume she wears . Offers me the rug to put over my knees . Gold embroidered coat of arms , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself in . The cold grippingtight around one 's bones . Past a broken roofless stone ruin of a cottage . Mounds marking old boundaries on hillsides . Bracken withered . I went to the library and studied books about this land . Flora fauna and climate . The grass full of frogs . Holds the world 's record for loneliness andp117rainfall . Out there the spirit would dissolve on the wind swept granite . Streams cutting down the hillsides spilling brown water . Fading light .

Macfugger golfing down the sweetmeats and macaroons , Lady Macfugger the winner at billiards , performed on the harpsicord . She said I had a marvellously straight nose in profile . And I went reeling off following Bonaparte to my room on an undertow of apricot brandy.  |p129Mine  was a lacy four poster bed . Whiskey and mineral water on the bedside table .

Lying in soggy heathers blasting at pheasant . Nails standing with his binocs briefing me as to strategic positions to be manned in case of attack from the army of insurrection . The sun shone this noon with a blue sky rising from the west . Lady Macfugger retiring mid morning with a demitasse and long cheroot which she smoked in the porcelain room .

Her chin high she spoke with a fluttering of eye lids . Picking up her pearls when asking a question and dropping them back and forth on her chest listening to an answer .

With each hit reining up his horse forelegs churning in the sky as he laughed and shook his rifle over his head . The soft moist breezes blowing . Down through wizened oak forests stretching along a valley . Visions of Veronica . Standing muscles rippling across her slim waisted belly . Hands on her hips . Loose hair streaked grey over her shoulders.  |p131Long  muscles on her thighs . My dear boy she said I am impoverished . You 've got that commodious castle .

Riding a massive grey hunter up a stony trail to the top of a steep hill . Following Macfugger 's big black arsed stallion as he outlined his campaign . Surveying the sprawling house and demesne from a high outcropping with the ever ready binocs round his neck , two automatics bulging under a riding coat . With a map in his lap , pointing with his riding whip . ' Now Clementine defensive positions can be established tight along here behind this ridge of granite .

Who took wild swipes at the chickens scattering between the confused legs of his platoon . Halt . For God 's sake halt . Wipe that grin off your face Kelly . Now listen to me .

Pounding in tight sweaty leggings.  |p137Staring  at the back of the neck ahead . Wondering when the Christ this mad drudgery would ever end . I was best as an overall strategist . The bold winning stroke delivered without warning with overwhelming superiority . Making an enemy run for his life . Clutching his backside . But they forced me to train to one day be an admiral chained to charts down in the bowels of a ship , sipping and chewing freshly made coffee and biscuits . Macfugger dismissing his troops . Striding with shoulders back across the courtyard . Stopping and confronting a rooster fluttering its wings and taking little threatening leaps at him in the air . A black boot swiftly coming upwards into the white fluffed feathers of its breast . The bird arcing up into the air landing ten yards away where it lays gasping through its open beak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damn bird attackingme . Damn nuisance when things do n't know who 's boss . Well I 'm getting that lot into shape . Drill some soldiering into them yet . Produce a battle classic of the few against the many . They need a little gung ho . Their strongest feature as troops is of course , their natural greed for destruction . Especially polished antiques . My ruddy arm 's broken holding this sten gun . Puts the fear of God into them . When I gave them a demonstration . Six bottles blasted out of the sky with my forty fives , three shots each from the left and right hand , they stood around thunderstruckfor ten minutes . Think it 's time now for tea . ' Veronica arriving on the arm of Bonaparte . Carried as she was to safety that first evening by wheelchair pushed by Macfugger . Who upon confronting our two piled up prostrate contorted bodies doubled into paroxysms of laughter and promptly fell sideways against the bedside table knocking whiskey and mineral water upon us . Later , recounting the story to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the telling by crippling slaps on the back , loudly saying by God there was your opportunity with the female form sublime . Seated to China tea and watercress sandwiches . Silver bowls of bon bons . Veronica festooned in chiffon scarves throwing back her head and sniffing in the air . Trying to shake something out of her mind . Macfugger smiling into his cup . One wants to streak away over the rocky mountain road towards home . Before it is reduced to ashes or turned into a mine or oil well . With mambas entwining loose about the drilling rig . ' By God a house full of cripples . Like my grandfather in his wheelchair . Never put foot outside Macfugger House during the last twenty five years of his life . Except once when there was a fire in a chimney . Even then he refused to budge off the front porch . Only exercise he got was picking his false teeth out of the soup each day . Always took a spoonful that was too hot and spit the whole thing out teeth and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Late grey afternoon I took my leave from the pillared front and granite steps of Macfugger House . Her ladyship and Nails waving from the doorway . The four in hand rumbling up the drive , turning left , through a village of pub and shop . Past a blacksmith shoeing a horse 's hoof over his thick leather apron in the doorway . Up a winding gorse lined road and across the lonely windswept hills . In my hand a letter slipped me by a maid . Opening it as the sprawling fields and parklands of Macfugger House lay distantly behind . Dear Mr Clementine , Although I hope we can still be friends in the future this is just to say that your callous indifference  |p139has  left me feeling quite ill . I hope you do n't think it was intentional to enter a gentleman 's bedchambers . I had an irresistible schoolgirl urge to try the skates . I used to ice skate in my youth on the canals of Holland . However it is irrelevant to the purpose of this letter which is to ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be picking up my car in two days . VeronicaThe dark grey tall walls of Charnel Castle . First evening star above a black cloud moving in from the sea . Soft salty wind . Waves splash up on the steep coastal cliffs and spread out on the sandy beach of the bay . Strange terrors out there bobbing on the waters . Goodbye to the Macfugger grooms . Hello to the Charnel dwellers . Clementine crossing the tiles of the great hall . Through the stray boulders surrounding a large pile of rubble . A yellow lamp glow illuminating where a bent head examinesa hole perforating a stone arch . Franz . Kneeling and picking away rocks and soil , poking his finger through the I i the circle of blackness as he suddenly looks up . ' I have unfortunately miscalculated . The excavation should have started perhaps another two yards to the east . There will not be much difficulty beginning a new digging . ' ' You 're breaking into the cellars . ' ' It was a mistake . But all my important discoveries have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bunch of you out of here and the holes filled in and the tiles replaced . ' Franz slowly shrugging his shoulders . Holds the pick handle aside and dislodges clay from the rusty cutting edges . Looking back up and scratching his head.  |p140Mr  Clementine you do try my patience . It will be most difficult to reach conclusions on our explorations here if you take that attitude . ' I do n't want your conclusions . And where are those mambas . ' ' My colleague Erconwald was of the opinion that they should be released in the surrounding countryside . ' Clementine swiftly ascending the great staircase . Along the corridors . Up past the coffin chamber to the lofty fortified confines of the octagonal room . Change out of Nails Macfugger 's borrowed rather loose fitting shooting garments . Nice bone buttons on the flies . A letter on my bedside table . All in the chamber neat and tidy . No Elmer to greet me . Check under the bed for snakes . Open this letter . Addressed to owner or occupier .

With a short resume of casual internal impediments.  |p141Sean  Macdurex Officer CommandingGHQThe CrossroadsDear Sir , This castle is already chock full of inhabitants , not to mention poisonous reptiles . Some of these inmates have been violent and others teeter on the verge and therefore I can not vouch for the safety of your troops . Interior excavations are also being conducted making it dangerous to wander inside here . I note that you do not mention any decorations awarded .

Ah am I disturbing you my dear Clementine . I have just come to say how glad I am to see you . To welcome you back . To indeed say all I can in humble greeting . It was with great excitement this morning that I witnessed ranunculous peeking with its yellow dewy flower just above the blades of graminea to afford itself the rays of a friendly sun . May I inquire had you a pleasant stay with your friends . I trust you slept well with no ill images troubling you . And that the gods of pleasant inconsequentialsmade your eyelids quiver with all that is joyful in slumber . May nymphs diaphanously clothed anoint you.  |p142And  might I trouble you to ask for a further moment of your time . ' ' It 's you . ' ' Ah . To be sure . Yes , it is I. I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now that the eta meson when discovered will reveal three new particles called pions . As we speak , low dark clouds tumble upon us from the sea . As we breathe new winds are born . ' ' Erconwald would you mind just cutting out the shit . ' ' Ah good person perchance you are aggrieved . ' ' Yes I am . ' ' But may I then kind sir hope that from a panorama of absurdities I might seek from you one harmless indul-gence . ' ' What . ' ' Merely to request your gracious presence to dine tonight with me . And be forgiven that I must for this purpose avail myself of the appurtenances of your household . In this connection perhaps you might tell me of the whereabouts of the wine cellar . ' I took a solitary walk in the rear cloister darknesses of the Charnel . Where a growling Toro suddenly thundered past the other side of a wall in the bramble undergrowth . Seagulls sliding up and down purple hillsides of sky . One so quickly gets hungry alone and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the night . Collect up little outposts of hope . High in towers instead of low down in dungeons . Where I showed Erconwald in the doorway of the wine cellar . And stretched out on a bed of straw laid across a shelf of champagne bottles , the prostrate bodies of Percival and Miss Ovary side by side , garments disarrayed indelicately . Elmer on the floor licking up a puddle of port and thumping his tail as he nuzzles his big black guilty drunken nose at my shoe.  |p143The  dining room lit with candles . A bleary eyed Percival bowing each time dropping his monocle and slightly lurchingbeside the door . Guests standing at their places . Two new ones . A sallow fat sweaty faced man whose name was whispered Bligh . And is it . Yes . My goodness , the sandy haired smoked salmon eating gentleman off the ship . All clapping as I entered . Followed by Percival to the head of the table where he seated me . My throat swallowing . Hold back the tears . What a terribly kind thing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servants and wine . A fire throwing a gigantic turf glow into the room . Erconwald mid way down the table between the largest of the exprisoners and the Baron . Rose to my right . Mrs L K L at the opposite end flanked by newcomers . Franz on my left nods his head . And gives me a little shy smile . Erconwald standing . Ladies and gentlemen I propose and I am sure you will second a toast to our most noble host . ' Charlene peeking from the serving door . A worried look across her face . As one stared down into the iced bowl of large and most perfect grains of beluga gutted from some sturgeon royal and far away . Sip this champagne bubbling palest gold . A tang of grape across the tongue . Rose smiling a big mouthful of teeth and growls as she packs the caviar on her shovel of toast and throws it back into the maw . My sandy haired friend nods and grins rejoicing in the unteetotal happiness . A triumphant procession . Of Fred the pig . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decorated with holly leaves and berries . His poor trotter sticking up in the air from a platter lugged by Ena and Imelda . Trays of steamingpheasant and wild rice . Percival pouring magnums of champagne . Auntie see me now . The toast of this group.  |p144No  one ever singled me out for a little flattery before . It 's nice . Clementine excusing himself from table . Standing in the adjoining state room near a large doll 's house in the darkness . Tears tumble . Good to cry . All pours out . Trickles from the floods of terror . A signal switches the track when you head out to die . Slowly roll there . On the heavy hopelesswheels . Till a kiss tugs you back to the teeming rails of life . A sound behind me . A figure . The lumpy shadow of Percival . Ah God sir , it 's a grand evening . I 've never come across the likes of such as that Mr Erconwald . A more kindly gentleman never trod earth . It was a surprise for you sir we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there below looking for the grandest of the vintages . Trying me best to tell the great from the grand and the grand from the great .

If it was n't for Elmer we 'd been kilt by the rats . ' Turf smoke gently lowering from the ceiling . Clementinereturning to table as the Baron raises his glass . His monocle flashing in the candle light . He smiles the saddest smile to me and bows his head . Must start some conversation . Just to slow the jaws grinding up the food and knives sawing on the plates . Commandeer Mrs L K L 's pistol for defence against the insurgents .

Occasioned first in the capital city during childhood upon our both swimming summers in the canal . Later we launched him upon his singing career . Many months spent abroad perfectinghis yodelling made him impatient with his slow recognition upon his return . The blaze of maximum publicitywe attempted to achieve by his riding our ostrich down the street failed upon the bird 's unrehearsed entry through the plate glass of a display window full ofp150undraped plastic mannequins . The mayhem therein permanentlygrieved us all . His wife is a woman of wealth and culture . Her photograph has been in news periodicals .

And inside , scattered turf embers smouldering over the room . Lead Kindly Light his grass skirt up around his throat prostrate on the table , both knees twitching . Blood pouring out the nose of one of the exprisoners . Rose and Mrs L K L flat on their backs , faces covered in plaster specks , still engripped in each other 's hair .

Ah God sir this is out of joint again . It 'll take a worse blast than that one now to put it back right again .

As Elmer now with his huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Percival sweeping up the smoking embers of turf . A donkey honks out across the fields . A sweet moist air of night breezing through broken windows .

Spun in the dark to make a waving sea of white . Charlene and Percival lugging me to bed . Mildly concussed I dreamt I dwelt in an igloo . Lots of folk kept arriving across the tundra . An enormous craps game developed on the packed snow over the north pole . I lost my shirt and woke up sweating . To see Elmer playfully on the floor eating the last of my precious money from Erconwald . Who lastly whispered as I was led away . Good person although the optical refinements of the dining hall are quite good the moment is now opportune to remove the more sombre expressions and over lavish use of the baroque . ' Lead Kindly Light of the backside contorted was last seen , a suit of armour over his grass skirt , making headway on hands and knees across the great hall and up on the mound of rubble where he attempted to stand and shakep153a mailed fist before falling backwards into the excavation .

I have been outwitted by the whole human race . I hitch hiked when I got off the boat . My luggage was lost or stolen or sent somewhere without me . I ended up with bowler hat faded light blue and a warped cane . Wet and frozen I started to walk and met a little group on the road .

One regrets not ever having let him win at chess . He asks for my bacon rinds . Laid out on a long piece of toasted soda bread . He sits chewing with seafaring blue eyes . A naval man just like myself . Percival arriving . To take orders for the day . Ca n't think of a thing except to have meals in future served right here behind my iron door . Mount Oscar to stand guard . On a spot where he wo n't plummet through the floor . And search all visitors for combustibles . Sorry sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were engaged . ' Bloodmourn standing .

Percival picking up a remnant of a bank note . Looks at Elmer peering up out of his dark eyes . Shakes his finger . Elmer burying his head under his paws and claws . Ah that was a night last night , was n't it sir . Now mind you if most of the blast had n't gone up the chimney we 'd have been kilt dead . Are you enjoying your breakfast of them tomatoes . ' Yes .

Going round he was making a holy commotion in armour boastingof his sexual knowledge after calling us fornicators .

Bloodmourn with me on a tour of castle grounds . Down moist mouldy tunnels of rhododendrons . Along overgrown paths of boxwoodhedges . Traces of springtime . Primroses peeking yellow from sheltery hedgerows . Bracken and heathers faintly growing green . Peering down the sheer cliff sides to the grey boulders and thrashing sea below . Warm sun , air salty and fresh . Walking along a narrow path over a bramble choked road . Leading back from the meadows to a tall brown entrance . Clementine smashing briars down with a walking stick . Bloodmourn helping to shift the rusted levers and push open the heavy oak gates into the castle courtyard .

' Clementine jumping , both hands caught on a roof gutter , feet dangling over the ground . Toro blazing forwardblindly under the sweater . And sailing through a closed stable door with a splintering and shattering of wood . Bloodmourn practising a cape movement in the hiatus . Slowly a state coach emerging driven forward byp157Toro no longer with the sweater over his eyes . With a neat hook of the head half the spokes of a rear wheel ripped out . Bloodmourn grabbing Toro by the tail as he reduces the coach to matchwood for ladies matches . This splendid vehicle demolished before I even knew I owned it . Everyone stay where you are . I 'm closing the gates . I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tearing round the confines . Removingtwo gutter pipes one after the other with a nuzzle of the horn .

Bloodmourn please , do n't . ' You must show them you 're not afraid . This roaring and pawing is mostly bluff . Get me an umbrella . ' A familiar voice from a rampart . Macfugger his dark red hair combed back , smilingly waving his cap down into the arena . ' I say there Clementine , just popped in . See you 've got a spot of bother . ' More faces at the turrets . Heads jutting over the ramparts . Some chewing on sandwiches . High up a hawk quivering . A tightly rolled umbrella landing . Bloodmourn side stepping in a crouch to pick it up . Legs astride unfurlingthe black folds , he presses the gleaming silk canopy open . Stamping a left foot he advances . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Toro backingup . His big ivory hooves splayed open over the stones . Bloodmourn 's coat suspended from the end of the umbrella as he advances .

Strode up to me as I stood in a draughty shed . She said , I think we have something to talk about . At an inn in a brightly coloured suit she ordered lunch . Of asparagus , lobster , salad , hock , raspberries and cream .

We are aware of course that there are certain mitigationsin the matter of damages and that you have provided food and lodging to our client and her husband .

Recently the goings on were much more than just filthy habits of idolators giving way to base motives of which the authorities ( and medical officer of the County Council ) would like to be informed .

Sure you get one ankle high that would make him run for his life . And he 's an awful man for the women .

A yellow sweater and grey jacket under his open coat , a tie just peeking from a rumpled white collar . Are we alone , Mr Clementine . ' Yes . The Baron is my aide de camp . ' ' I understand . I am commandant Macdurex of the fourth tank division Western Army . I am here in furtheranceof my orders issued by the supreme command of which you were notified in my letter . I am also in receipt of your letter in reply to mine . This is an institution of some sort . ' Wo n't you sit down . ' I will thank you . ' Can I offer you something to drink . ' I would thank you but I 'm on official business . ' Would you mind if I had a drink . ' Lower away . Quite a place you 've got here . ' Yes it is . ' Must take a lot of looking after . ' Yes it does . ' Now I am bound to inform you that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligence report which has come to hand is not conclusive . I would appreciate your help . Are you a doctor . ' ' No . ' I take it there is a residential staff to look after the patients . ' No . ' Adjusting his monocle , the Baron looking up from his chess game . The bell of the courtyard clock gonging outp180eight o'clock . The commandant looking at his watch and taking a last puff from his stump of cigarette . ' Is there not some risk seeing as you 've had a blast here already . ' There are three scientists but not medically qualified . The occupants are guests . ' Voluntarily committed are they . ' ' I would n't quite put it that way but certainly none of them have shown any signs of voluntarily leaving . ' Is that so . Most of your asylums , around this neck of the woods anyway , have a devil of a time to keep the inmates in . But if as you say they are content here , that 's all that matters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could lend a hand . ' Commandant , I should be quite pleased if your troops drove the whole bunch of them right out . ' The monocle dropping from the Baron 's eye . Scars down his cheeks in the light . Courtyard clock now gonging three . Commandant Macdurex again regarding his wrist watch . Percival said that when he had the clock fixed it would be grand to have a time of day ready at your finger tips . Mr Clementine I 'm sure your patience must be tried now and again but I could not take the responsibility of putting violent lunatics loose on the roads . Keeping them subdued inside the premises is one thing but chasing them every which way out over the countryside is another . One was seen running loose from here a while back hurdling stone walls chased by another going through the walls . Now that kind of antic would occupy a platoon of troops . But I am quite prepared to station men to quell uprising and the like . ' I would like that Commandant . How long will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes to rout out a foreigner over the hills there . A ferocious piece of work he is too . For security reasons I ca n't discuss it at the moment . But I 'll have a drink now official business is done . ' The Baron pouring glass fulls from a decanter of malt . The wheaty aroma cutting through the damp smells . The commandant sitting back in his chair looking up at the high windows , across the book cases and panelled walls . ' I 'd say this would be an old place . ' Yes . ' And cold in the winter . ' And in the springtime too . ' Well a sup of this keeps down the chill . Nice to have books around . In my spare time I am a bit of a poet . ' Ah . ' Make an odd verse out of my everyday experience as you might say . ' ' I 'd like to read one and I 'm sure the Baron would too . ' Well while I 'm stationed in this area and going into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here on this little bit of envelope came to mind . It is called closing time . ' The commandant handing over an envelope . On one side an address , Colonel Sean Macdurex , GHQ , The Bivouac , The Crossroads and on the other a poem scrawled in a small tight hand . The streetWas emptyThe street was sadAnd then by GodThe pubs shutAnd the street was madp182That 's very nice . ' It was instant inspiration . I was changing pubs at the time . After the unholy upheaval out on the road with fists and boots flying I went into the hotel to get a little bit of peace among some decent law abiding foreign visitors having a game of bridge . I was n't a minute there before this ignorant lout with a pair of ears on him big enough he could flap and fly comes in . He charges straight across the lounge . Picks up the bridge table and slams it upside down on the floor just as your woman is bidding two no trumps . I thought to myself what kind of tales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to their homelands . It was three good blows on the back of his spine with a piano stool before he was subdued . Meanwhilehe 'd pulled every picture down off the wall , put out every window with his fist and flung these respectable people 's drinks in their faces . Padrick he was called . Never a word did he say . This verse here was appropriately composedupon that occasion . ' When insultIs not addedTo injuryWhile the night 's not sane By God thenExpect from your manMore maimCommandant Macdurex downed two large whiskies and suddenly stood up , clicking rubber heels with a thud and smartly saluting . The Baron jumping from his chair to attention and bowing . In the middle of this military departuremy hand slipping where I was leaning on the desk . The commandant spinning round swiftly reaching inp183under his coat . Towards a bulge . As I straightened up again a smile came over his lips and he gave a little nod of the head . ' Mr Clementine we will be keeping in touch . ' The Baron in cut away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opening the library door . The commandantfalling into step as they clicked across the great hall . The Baron on his return said the commandant had challenged him to a game of chess . Three days of sun in a row I spent bird watching from my turret . Thrilled by nature on the wing . While Bloodmourncould be heard passing along corridors with a crutch thumping on the floor . Rumours reaching one of body contact between himself and Rose . Percival said the exprisoners were standing guard outside Mrs L K L 's door , bringing in her food and bearing out her wastes . Bligh had locally collected children together and was teaching them folk songs gathered around a fire on the beach at night where they sang . He said he wanted to rehearse them to give a rendering in the chapel . Charlene each morning stayed chatting longer and longer when she brought breakfast . Blue eyes smiling . Relating the castle backbiting , food thefts , slander and lies of the night before . Sleeves rolled back . Muscles flexing on her narrow white arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she sat on the bed , her back towards me as she spoke over her shoulder . I reached out and her face flushed as I touched the little hard nobs up and down her spine . Next morning she came to sit again . And I put my hand up under her sweater and passed over each little vertebrae humping under the smooth soft skin . ' I like you doing that . It sends shivers and tingles all over me . ' ' I 'm glad . '  |p184So  am I and you know what I heard . Imelda the other day . She was bent up double in the old kitchen against the pig curing trough and I thought she would fall in dying laughing . Took me the time it would take to cook an ox to get the story out of her . Seems as she was larking about with two boys beyond telling them of a wondrous trick that a certain Padrick did do with his tool . And they said they could do the trick as well . With their own tool they said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ah so , it 's no trick you 've been doing with that thing you have on you for every man in the parish is able to do the same trick as yourself . And Padrick says is n't the trick easy enough to learn after someone sees you doing it and was n't the whole countryside watching the day he did it . It was n't till I told Imelda what it was Padrick showed her that she knew and she 's still down there in the kitchen not able to stop laughing . Dropped a whole pot of potatoes peeled for tonight . Said everytime she thinks of it she 's convulsed . That big blabber mouth 's chased me home over the fields many a time . ' Did he ever catch you . ' Not on your life I 'm as fast as a deer . That is not to say that I have n't had my experiences . Which maybe I 'll tell you sometime . I really look forward to our chats like this in the morning . It 's over stepping my place . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' I 'm not complaining . I wo n't mention names but I can tell you that a lot goes on here that would make the devil himself green with envy . ' Hold Charlene 's ribs from the side pinched between my hand . Her tongue out licking over her lips . Doing a wondrous trick with my own tool . Pushing up the tray . Topple the teacup . She sits arms forward , reddened handsp185stilled in her lap which take up buckets of water , wash over floors , make my bed , tug the entrails from chickens . Unlucky enough to go clucking in this castle . Where one did once streaking out of the pantry passage , flying across the library and scratching up along the shelves of books . Chased by Elmer 's clacking great grey hungering jaws . Charlene caught it . And said if you kill it I 'll cook it . And I stood out in the yard clutching the feathery thing to my chest near the rain water barrel turning my head away as I plunged it in . Tough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squawking blue murder . Out came a laughingCharlene catching up the dripping cornered bird by the legs , plopping its head on a block and with one swipe of her cleaver taking off its head . The bird 's neck spurting blood as it flapped around the cobbles . Had to keep myself from putting hands up to cover my eyes . Next morning at breakfast Charlene was brisk and busy . Till I said I was no chicken killer . And a soft grin grew across her face , lashes of her eyes flickered and I wanted to touch the blue vein on her neck . She sits there now , eyes cast down , my hand moving up under her sweater . Under there these smooth white things with hardened little tips under the matted wool . ' Mr Clementine . I want to ask you a question . ' Yes . ' ' Do you fancy me . ' ' Yes . ' ' You wo n't mind if I ask you something else personal . ' ' No . ' ' Do you fancy Lady Macfugger . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I guess she 's very grand and rich . And can have anything she wants . And you 've heard stories about me , have n't you . ' ' I had a letter . '  |p186'It  was about me , was n't it . The dirty filthy pigs . What did it say . ' Just a general letter about the historic nature of the surroundings . It did mention though that livestock morals were loose in the district and the department of agriculture were investigating . ' Before you hear any more lies I 'll tell you the truth . While I was just an impressionable little lass I 'd rise to the bait of any little flattery flung me way . A business man in the town had a car and gave me rides . Before I knew what was happening I 'd given myself to him . To tell you the truth I was just like Imelda . Only that lecherous old bastard told me he was putting in his thermometer to get my temperature . He owned the chemist 's shop and I believed him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as God ever made anyone . Had a little book . He 'd say you 've been a very good girl today your temperature was ninety eight point seven degrees . He had a pair of brown shoes with the leather soles so thin he had only to step out of his car and they were worn out . I 'd hide at the end of the town in behind a wall . He 'd pick me up and we 'd drive with me crouching down in the back till we got here to the castle , rumoured as it was to be filled with ghosts and terrors where no one would venture . Which I suppose is true enough . My grandmother had stories aplenty to tell . We came to a bedroom just above off the great hall . After a few occasions of taking my temperature he then one eveningleft me . After he 'd asked me to do something to him that five minutes later he said was unnatural . Stood shaking his finger at me in a bit of moonlight shining into the great hall . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own way back alone to town in the dark . 0 God I 'll never forget it . I wet myself with fright . I got lost . Listening to the rats I just must have finally fainted and they found me para/lysed and my hair turning white the next afternoon . Then the dirty bastard wanted me to marry him . When I would n't he spread stories . That I was here in the castle giving out to a queue of farmers ' sons and itinerants . The man spread filth and evil about me everywhere . And later when I was going with a nice young boy he poisoned him against me . Maybe it was as well for me the young lad died . Pneumonia suddenly came on him and he was destroyed . One evening he was passing down the road with a load of turf kneeling up in a cart and the next he was up on his next of kin 's shoulders in his coffin . Not a thing left but a few ould stones on top of where he lies . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure enough been plenty of hell . They preach to you that God is good and generous . I think he must be a scoundrel . If he accepts worship from the diseased hypocrites of that town . Not a soul here you can trust . From the moment they lay eyes on you their little brains are scheming how to get the better of you . A back turned is a back stabbed . Do you think I 'm out of my mind . ' ' No . ' ' I do . You 've got such beautiful teeth . I 've lost two behind here . Not one in your head is missing . Open . God that 's pure radiant gold in the middle of your back molars . You 've got a mouth like a tabernacle . You 'd be at risk asleep with it open . Some of them would have that precious metal out of your head and into the pawn . I do n't know but that it would n't be a relief to be ugly and know that the world will never like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at my hands . I 've got the fingernails bit down to me elbows . I 'd better be on my way about me chores or I 'll get fired . ' ' Do n't go . ' ' Your man Percival will be arriving any moment . He 's  |p188a  one full of his authority . Thinks he has forty parlour maids and a dozen cooks when the few of us are standing down there in front of him in the kitchen of a morning . Telling us the boss wants this done the boss wants that . It 's Mrs L K L who never lets up . Yanking on the servants ' bell . You can hear the wires twinging in the walls . Propped up on the pillows as if she owned the place . She says in that high toned way of hers , I say you 're late with my tea . Then she wants me to stay and pour it out for her in the cup . I said you 're no cripple . She said how dare you . I hope you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interloper , I would n't know what that was but it sounded good . Some of the people you have staying here would bleed you white . I guess I better keep my place and keep my trap shut . I just do n't think it 's right that a kind and generous person like yourself should be put upon . ' Percival rapping with his door key . Charlene leaping up off the bed . Quickly pulling down her sweater which I slowly pulled up . She sails a cloth back and forth across the marble wash stand . And clanks a shovel full of light brown turf ash in a bucket . She backs away as Percival enters . Three ledgers stacked in the crook of his arm . ' Good morning your worship . I trust you slept well . ' ' Yes thank you Percival . ' ' There have been I am sorry to report sir , shocking depredations in the wine cellars . A person or persons unknown have entered without authority and removed quantities of spirits . I have my suspicions who it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elmer has downed two chickens . He was with me out in the yard looking mild as you please when four of them struts by . I turn my back to answer a call of nature and two are left . It would be as well if we put them wild ones remaining in a coop.  |p189'But  good news too sir . Tim is turning a few sods up there in the old kitchen garden sowing spuds and cabbages . He 's come across the old rhubarb beds , gooseberry and raspberry bushes . In no time crops will be pouring out into the markets . ' Percival I do n't think I can hold out that long . ' Sir are n't you sitting on a mountain of priceless personalchattels , sure in the new world over there they go wild over the genuine worm holes .

It 's like lifeand breath to them to roar and ravage over the countryside ,  |p190anything  to get their hands on a sapling and tear it roots and all from the earth . Now to commissary matters . I thought with the bread we 'd be all right keeping on with the fourteen loaves a day . Only five pounds of butter went yesterday . But it 's the bacon and eggs . Eighty two of your good sized hen 's eggs in the twenty four hours with nearly ten pounds of bacon . Your man above in the shop is lunatic trying to keep up the supply . ' ' 0 God .

There 's money in them . And a beast or two out there on the grass would not hurt you either . ' How much land have we Percival . ' Well now that might be a little difficult to figure straight off . With an exact figure that is . But you 'd have a fair bit now on that mountain . I 'd not be far amiss to say there 'd be seven hundred acres . The demesne would have another nearly three hundred . There 'd be fifty or sixty more down to the beach . And out that way on the headlandyou could reckon a hundred and seventy . ' ' If we tried farming . ' By God then you 'd be right . Sure we 've got Toro out there who 'd have any heifer you 'd bring near him in calf in no time . Sheep would be your man for the mountain . In springtime we 'd have the lambs leaping and kicking across the meadows . ' All right Percival , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm glad you said that . ' Days floating by while Bloodmourn played the Baron in chess . And I waited to play the winner . Paging throughp191great leather tomes , standing by the table throughout the afternoons . The Baron shaking his cuffs down before he delicately lifted and placed a piece . Bloodmourn first leaningover the board then straightening and rising in his seat . Pouncing when he could capture . Rapidly sweeping up the Baron 's bishop or knight . To get from the Baron three rare slowly made words . Ah is dat so . ' Putlog and Erconwald arriving in the library to frown , murmur and shake their heads . Bloodmourn and the Baron fighting bitterly to three consecutive draws . Franz entering , a miner 's lamp attached to his head , greasy clay sods from his boots wiped on the rug recently made presentable by Charlene . Smoke rising from cigars and cigarettes . The fourth match brooding on through the night . Percival opening the shutters next morning as the two seated figures still sat heads in hands . Mrs L @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three prisoners and Lead Kindly Light in a sedan chair unearthed from somewhere . The group approaching one down the hall with slow measured steps . I nipped smartly into the nearest room . Ear held to the door till it went by . One of her solicitor 's recent letters had a change of tone . Suggesting that perhaps a solution could be reached should a meeting be convened at the site of the various ugsorne complaints . And one casually calm night Bligh came up the stony little pathway from the beach leading his chorus of voices each carrying a candle . Making a glittering winding snake slowly crawling across the hillside in the dark . High on the ramparts , castle inmates waiting . A soft still evening of sparkling stars . Through the gates , front door and across the great hall they came . Up the grand staircase and along the corridor to the chapel . Percival nudging my elbow.  |p192Sir  the Charnel has never seen the likes of this before I can tell you . ' I sat left of the aisle . Erconwald and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baron sitting together . Taking time out from the library where they sat locked in their sixteenth game . After fifteen draws . The Macfuggerscame . Nails bright eyed at the sight of three young blue eyed big bosomed singing sisters . Chaperoned by a big bosomed blue eyed mother . A cheerful gathering meek and mild . Rose heard above the choruses roaring her head off . Percival with four of the staff kneeling at the rail in the loft where Putlog sweats over the keys and foot pedals of the organ . Tim keeping candles lit . Mrs L K L blocking the aisle with exprisoners and sedan chair behind which stood Lead Kindly Light in full armour . And the little voices raised in song . Down in the valleyUp in the skyOur voices singingThe armies marching byAt this verse Clementine turning to look behind . Might be the signal for the insurgents .

And Charlene by the stone font at the chapel doorway , a black lace mantle on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through teeth missing here and there . Eyes wide and roving . Staring at the strange shrouded figure in the sedan chair . That little boy 's folded hands trembling . All their faces scrubbed red cheeked and clean . My brown skinned nurse April whop193said you are cured . See her face smiling up against the altar there . Death could come now . In the middle of this recital . Unnoticed . Take me to lay under sods beyond the granite walls . Out on the headlands . Waves white along the coast . The wild loneliness . And a moist wind wetting the soul . After the singing the gladdened assemblage descending to the first state room off the great hall set for tea . Cakes and sandwiches spread on a table . Honeycombs and damson jam . Bloodmourn and the Baron rubbing their eyes . Whiskey poured . Bligh smiling to his congratulations . Tightly entwining his hands and nodding his head . ' It was very impressive . ' Thank you Mr Clementine , I had a lot of work to do on them . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Now I wonder is there a little favour I could ask of you .

If it 's seaworthy most certainly . ' Thanks a lot . I 'm a brewer by trade . I 'm sorry now I have n't had much time to talk to you . You feel kind of awkward in a stranger 's house .

' Hair ashimmer she leans against the wall sweet of breath . Lanterns go shadowy up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Could touch it with my hand . Touch it . Along the jaw line . It bends up under her ear .

I do believe that genitalia were on display . ' In all their GloryAs wellAs a tricky PairIn all their **26;12420;TOOLONG as carefully shaped . With a little imagination a man could tell himself that the Divine Sculptor had taken pains with it . With his whip Ewing indicated it . " Titty Butte , " he said . " What ! " " Buttes , we call ' em . Not hills , Prof. " He broke the little silence by adding , " You can see the resemblance . " " And you call it that ? " " Did . But times are changin ' . Nowadays , for the good of society and the pertection of pups , there 's a move on to call it Breast Butte @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . It 's mostly women  --  them as have ' em  --  do n't like ' em called Titty . But some of us ai n't likely to change . " Ewing fell silent , musing , Collingsworth supposed , on thei ways of propriety . After a moment he went on . " What 's wrong with a right name , Prof ? Titty , boobie , breast  --  what 's the difference ? Never could get it through my head . Always , seems like , people got to think up parlor words for words that mean the same . Me , I stick with old and simple . What 's that the poet said about a rose ? " " ' A rose by any other name  --  ' " " Would smell as sweet or stink as bad . " Ewing touched up the horses . " Get in the collar , you pelters . " They were going down a slope now , and around and in advanceof them the sights were changing . Some gaunt , horned cows grazed here and there . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not far from a band of sheep and the canvas-covered wagon that must house him . He raised a lonely hand and let it fall . A bird , a lark perhaps  --  bird thou never wert  --  sprinkleda song in the dry grass . No fences yet , though . Not a fence or a building . Ahead and down , a mile or more away , a snarled ribbon of green wound . There , Collingsworth imagined , would be the Breast River . To ask about it would be to change the subject.  | " Yep , " Ewing answered . " There 's the Titty . In flood now . " " In flood ? How so ? " " Snow in the mountains , more'n ever I saw . Then come a sudden warm streak and rains high up , one day on top of another . Snow melt and rain . That 's the how-so of it . " " Dangerous crossing ? " " Never lost a passenger yet , Prof. Got bowled over just once and wished I could swim , but all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aboard . " Ewing smiled , his eyes on that other time . " I lost the year 's load of Monkey ' Ward catalogues , though . Bad for business and worse for us . " He paused , perhaps waiting for a cue . Collingsworth said , " Oh ? " " Our secret readin ' suffered , and that 's not the all of it . Head and hind end , what 's a privy without a catalogue in it ? " Not much of a joke , a chestnut in western dress  --  no , in Ewing 's dress  --  but Collingsworth smiled . They began creaking down a bald hill , and the river came into sight and , this side of it , a rattletrap barn and a corral and a hitching post and an outhouse standing naked and desolate upstream from them . An old man doddered out from the barn . Ewing drew up beside it . " Gon na change ? " the old man asked . Before he answered , Ewing faced Collingsworth . " Privy up yonder , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stage door , hoping Mary Jess would n't say peepee again . It would be revealingenough , God knew , for his females to go traipsing up t o the outhouse . I le got them out and spoke shortly , not wanting to risk an announcement of need . " Up there , " he said with a jerk of his head . May had the satchel and the baby and , followed by Mary Jess , set off as serenely as a blackberry picker.  |p14Ewing  went into the barn , no doubt to relieve himself , and came out and said to the old man , " I do n't guess I 'll change , then . This team ai n't fagged by a long shot , and it 'll be steadierabout crossin ' over . " Not until then did Collingsworth really look at the river . It was n't in flood as he knew floods . It had none of the slow , foul , upward creep of the White or the Wabash . Muddy rather than foul , it was a torrent . Even at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for creepers , not for waters with far destinations . But waters with far destinations had little time for depth , either . The Breast , boiling over boulders , sweeping unbroken when it could , did not look deep . It did n't need to look deep to look dangerous . Collingsworth made for the barn , seeing in passing that feed bags had been put on the team . When he came out , May and the children were waiting . Now he could say , " How goes it , Maysie ? Feel up to the rest of the trip ? " " How much longer , Father ? " Mary Jess asked . The question was not a complaint . The child never complained , even now when so tired she appeared almost feverish . " Here , " Collingsworth said , " let me take Tommie . " May turned the baby over to him and answered Mary Jess . " We 'll be there before you know it , sweetheart . You 're going to take a nice nap . Then it wo n't be so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile . Thank the Lord , he 'd quit crying . Collingsworth kissed him . " We got along just fine , " May said , " and we are up to the rest . Tommie slept most of the way . I fixed the curtains so Mary Jess and I could see out . " " Great , is n't it ? " Collingsworth asked , putting a confidence into his voice that would be closer to truth once they were over the river . " I did n't know my eyes could see so far . "  |p15Mary  Jess put in , " Did you see the king of the bunny rabbits ? That 's what Mamma said he was . The king . " " And so he is , and I saw him . Now , Maysie , do n't be afraid when we ford the river . And do n't you , Mary Jess . We 'll be across in no time and hi-ho on our way . " Ewing came scuffing toward the stage , absently kicking from his path bits of harness and orphaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the old man had allowed to accumulate . Anticipating him , Collingsworth put his family inside and mounted to his seat . Wordless now , Ewing drove the horses to the edge of the river and checked to let them drink , his eyes studying the restlesswater . After the first long draft the horses raised their heads and appeared to study it , too , before drinking more . " All right , " Ewing said , his voice harsh . " Get up now ! " He spanked the team with the reins . Both horses hesitated , then plunged ahead . The stage creaked and lurched and ground through the shore gravel and lurched harder in the boulders of the stream bed . Collingsworthfound himself holding on and looked quickly back , right and left . No one thrown out yet , thank heavens  --  but he should be inside with his family . The horses snorted and felt for footing and stumbled on , the muscles writhing in their haunches ; and the water churned and rose hub deep and deeper . May would be trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ewing said , " ' Bout there . " It was then that the off horse fell . It struggled up and fell again and , rising a second time , stood off-balance and unmoving . Nor would the lash of the whip get it going . Ewing said , " Christ sake ! " He swiveled around and yelled back to shore , " Have to double-team ! Quick ! " The old man shuffled toward the barn.  | " Leg , " Ewing said . " Good crucified Jesus ! You hold the team . " But Collingsworth was already busy with his shoes . " You ca n't swim . " He felt the coach inching sidewise . " I 'm the skinner . " " Skin then ! " He had his shoes off . Next came his coat . Holding on to the coach , he let himself into the water . His toes cramped and curled at its touch . Now , hanging on , he saw May , her face as anxious as at the illness and death of their firstborn . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Help 's coming . Do n't worry . " As he cast off from the coach , her words reached him like an echo . " Benton ! Oh , Benton ! " lie flattened and stroked , fighting the current . By the Lord , water would never defeat him . The old man was waiting to help him ashore . He did n't need any help , much less the little help the old man could give . He had n't lost more than thirty yards to the push of the water . " I got the team harnessed and outside , " the old man said as Collingsworth lifted himself and came , dripping , to dry land . " What 's left to do is just latch on to the doubletree . " " Come on ! " Collingsworth hurried him to the horses that stood harnessed and tied to the rack . The old man dragged up a doubletree and started attaching to it the tugs that led from one horse . Collingsworth stepped in to hook up the other . Too late the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't seen the kick coming . It caught him in the thigh and knocked him down , and for a bare instant he lay there , thinking his leg might be broken . Something pushed into him from underneath , and he struggled to his hands and knees and saw it was the piece of corral pole . He seized it and rose and limped to the head of the horse that hadp17kicked him and swung it . The pole broke between the horse 's ears . The horse sagged in its harness , and its eyes glazed , but it did n't go down . Collingsworth crippled back and finished attachingthe traces . Here was one horse that would n't kick for a while . He felt the old man 's eyes on him . " Short chain , " the old man said , lifting the hooked end of it from the doubletree . He might have been writing a telegram . " Hook to the tongue loop . Pull enough . " Collingsworth took the chain , tucked the end once around his belt and anchored it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " God Almighty and Davy Jones . " " Team has to pull me there . Any better ideas ? " For an answer the old man trudged around and untied the horses . Collingsworth gathered up the reins . He let the horses draw the doubletree to the water , the big chain that bound him to them hanging loose and heavy from his belt . His leg was going to be all right . To pull alongside the stage and its team , he had to approach from upstream , calculating distance and drift with a nicety he doubted he had . The reins were the thing , the reins to keep the horses on course . He clasped them tight and shouted , " Get up ! " It seemed long before the team lunged , before the chain snapped taut and yanked him along with his belt cinched on his spine . He ran to the chain 's pull , ran until he fell down and got up and fell and got up and could n't run anymore . He could only lurch and go flat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new boulders waited unseen to trip him up , to bruise or break foot and knee . He jerked one rein hard . It dodged crazily into his head that he was like a boy again , running so fast downhill that he could n't hold up or keep up and so sprawled . The force of gravity , and gravity was the chain that pulled him sprawling.  |p18Now  he could find no foothold at all , and the tide washed him , strangling , out of line with the horses . It swung him around on his anchor chain almost against the side of the horse that had kicked him . He grabbed for a harness hold and caught a breath and reined the team dead upstream . Back in line , he could climb to his feet , long enough to set the horses on course again . He had some of the hang of it now . Resist the chain . Slant backward , feet feeling in front . Snug reins for balance . Drive chariot ! He forced the team alongside the stage team and drove just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the stage would just stand ? He said , " Easy , boy , " almost into its ear . He crooked an arm around the neck yoke to steady himself . He went to work on the chain . An infernal impediment , the reins and the short reach of that one arm . When at last he was free , he rammed the hook into the iron loop on the tongue . He yanked his arm from the yoke then and caught the balled point of the hames with one hand . The reins , held in the other , looked even enough . He glanced back , blinking water , and saw only Ewing , bent forward for a signal . Collingsworthbobbed his head . Above the voice of the water he heard the command of the whip . They were moving . He could tell by the strain on his arm and the heave of the horse the current forced him against . They were moving , and now he could wade easily enough , and the crunch of iron tires on gravel came to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they needed . Looking back , he saw May 's face at the side of the coach like a picture held out . The picture was smiling . Ewing called , " Whoa , now . " He climbed down and came forward and took the reins from Collingsworth 's hands , reservinghis words if he had any.  |p19Collingsworth  hurried back . " May , you all right ? Children all right ? " " A little wet . I am at least . Oh , Benton , you 're a mess . " What she meant was , he knew , thank God , he was safe . " Great introduction to the wild and woolly , " he answered . By George , it had been . " Want to get out ? " " Maybe we 'll just stay here if it wo n't be too long . Would you believe it , the baby 's asleep ? " He nodded and went to join Ewing , who was busy with horses and harness . " I 'll hook up the fresh team , " Ewing said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old Shorty  --  " He made a little gesture that Collingsworth followed . Old Shorty stood with one leg lifted and useless . It was bent like an elbow between knee and pastern . Slowly for a man who had seemed decisive , Ewing began stripping the gear from the cripple . " Got lodged between boulders , I reckon , " he said in a flat voice . " Must have . " He carried the harness to the rear of the stage and came back with a halter that he fitted on Shorty . Not until he had the thing buckled did he say , " You did what I could n't ' ve , Prof. " It was his thanks , Collingsworth guessed . Whatever it was , it was hard to acknowledge . He shrugged . " Only did what I could . " When Ewing had substituted the fresh team and tied the extra horse to the tail of the stage , he came around and brought down the rifle . The injured horse stood on its three legs , its head down . Ewing went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closer . " Truest horse a man ever had , " Ewing said . He might have been writing an epitaph in the air . He stroked the horse 's neck . " Shorty . Old Shorty . " With a show of decision , of acceptance , he turned to Collingsworthto say , " I 'll coax him downriver a piece so 's he wo n't foul the ford . Do n't matter too much , long as coyotesp20and wolves got empty guts . " Collingsworth nodded . " And , Prof , will you drive the stage on a ways ? It ai n't a good sight for women and children . " Collingsworth answered , " No , Mort . You take the stage . I 'll take Shorty . " Ewing did n't answer immediately . His gaze crossed the river and focused , Collingsworth realized of a sudden , on the spot where he had clubbed the horse that had kicked him . So Ewing had seen . Collingsworth had a short answer . " It wo n't be a pleasure . " Silently , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As Collingsworth started to lead away , the horse hobbling behind him , Mary Jess called from the stage . " Father ! Please do n't make the poor horsey walk . It hurts him . " He dropped the rope and went over to her and extended his hand and laid it on her head . Her braided hair , tied with two little bows , was lighter and finer than the finest cornsilk . " Do n't you worry , honey . " How should he say it ? " It 's just a little way to the finest pasture the horsey ever saw . " He took the rope and moved off , hearing behind him the beginning grind of wheels . Not until he had topped and descendeda low knoll , going easy because of the horse , did he come to a halt . The stage was out of sight . The horse looked at him . An old , slobbery horse with a nogoodleg and the mist of pain in its eyes . Pain and perhaps hope underneath , for man was God and could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bones , save souls . God will take care of me . Yes . Of course . But God wished he had a blindfoldfor those praying eyes . The rifle was slow in getting itself cocked and coming up . Its sights wavered away from the point of kill . When finally it fired , it shook every distance . Shorty collapsed to the shot , not thrashing once . Only the hide moved , the whole hide , riffling small as water to thep21touch of a pebble . It was as if each hair had its own death to die . When they had all died , Collingsworth levered out the spent cartridge , put the rifle on half cock and removed the halter . Wolf bait was left . Just as good , better , than food for the worms . The stage could n't be far away . It was n't . Ewing had pulled up when out of sight . Collingsworthtossed the halter in the back of the stage and went around to mount . No sounds came from inside . Collingsworthclimbed to his seat and put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's eyes , he only nodded . Ewing clucked to the horses . For miles they rode without speaking , rode silent and westwardinto the sun . It was , Collingsworth could fancy , as if the shot had shot down all words . He had none to ask about the little earth rats or ground squirrels that he saw . Finally , as the sun touched the mountains , Ewing said , " I declare . I forgot . " " About what ? " " Grub  --  and your missus and little one . I reckon they 're hungry enough to eat the heel of a boot . " " We 'll manage . " " Seldom I have ladies or children aboard , or take so long gettin ' home . Men , they make out . But Soo Son will be open , or I 'll tail him up . " " Something very simple will do . " " You got that at the house the school board rented , pendin ' your pleasure . " " What ? " " Oh , fresh milk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ butter and the like of that . " " That 's enough , but who in the world  --  ? " " People . " Ewing could smile now , and , smiling , say withoutovertones , " It ai n't every day brains comes to our camp . " " And they do n't even know me. "  |p22The  sun sank , leaving a high fire over the mountains , leaving a glory ; and below them spread a green valley with the softened shapes of settlement in it . The air was so quiet one could think it was walled against wind . What was it and who wrote it ? A beauteous evening , calm and free . Dark had fallen when they pulled up to the drugstore and post office where Ewing got out to drop the mail sack , explainingthat that service came first and then he 'd take them on home . Lamps glowed here and there , not bright enough to reveal very much . A few men met the stage , out of habit or curiosity about the new prof , whom they 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all of them , until Ewing returned . Then one of them stepped forward with him and offered his hand . " I 'm Jay Ross , " he said , " and you 're the professor . " The man was heavy rather than fat . He had a broad face and an open , exploring gaze . In his free hand he held a fat cigar . " Yes , " Collingsworth answered . " But principal , not professor . I 've looked forward to meeting you . " " You and Ewing get along all right ? " " Just fine . " " Figured you would . " He waved his cigar in Ewing 's direction . " We all do on the school board . " He chuckled , as if at an absurdity . " So far . " " School board ! " " Why , sure . Did n't old Post Mortem tell you ? " So now it was plain . Now he knew why he had been invited to share the driver 's seat . A soundingout , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Had he passed ?  |p23AFTER  DELIVERING the Collingsworths and helping Collingsworthinside with their belongings , Ewing took his outfit to McCabe 's livery stable . Because old Rank was out and probablydrunk again , he had to see to the horses himself . Such was the life of a skinner , he thought while he stood outside and shaped a cigarette he really did n't want . He rolled a pebble under the sole of his boot . Once , maybe , before the ice age that books speculated about , it had been a proud thrust of rock . Then the glaciers had taken it and through the years trundled it , and here it was now , big and proud as a pea . He shrugged against the feeling inside him . It was the loss of old Shorty that lowered his spirits . It was the absence of grub . Down the street the oil lamps of the saloons announced business as usual . The boys at the Arfive House would be waiting for a report , one more positive than he was ready to snake . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things , Mrs. Collingsworth had asked him to stay and take supper with them ! Dishes enough in one bag , she had said . Camp dishes they had taken to use on the train . And the bacon and fresh bread and good eggs that unknown friends had provided ! Please stay . Jesus Christ , a worn-out woman in a strange house with two babies and the duffel notp24yet put away . Some women were like that , but , like potatoes , they were damn few to the hill . After he had refused , clumsily he knew , Prof had said to the little girl , " Mary Jess , you have n't forgotten your manners ? " Mary Jess stepped to him , with a confidence unexpected , and held out her hand . " Thank you very much for a nice ride . " Her eyes , meeting his , were wide and quiet and grave , too grave somehow for a little girl . " Father said your horsey was on good pasture now . " " Well  --  " He had to swallow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sure he is . Richest graze ever . " How old was the girl ? Four or six ? Make it as old as hope and smile at yourself . He tossed away the unlighted cigarette and walked to the light that told him Soo Son was still open . The place was empty of customers , he thought as he entered . Then he heard voices and a low laugh from beyond the black curtain that closed off the rear . There , in booths reached by a side door , Eva Fox and her girls could eat . Would n't do to feed them in public . He reckoned the place was still open on account of their presence . Soo Son waddled up along the counter , smiling . He was a happy Chinaman  --  maybe . " Stage pletty late , " he said . Ewing nodded . " Some trouble . Not much . Roast beef and potatoes if you got ' em , Soo Son . " Still smiling , Soo Son turned toward the kitchen . A happy Chinaman , huh ? Picker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now restaurant owner . No more'n couple or so years ago , he had imported a Chinese bride , completewith Oriental duds and once-bound , baby-size feet . The feet made her totter . Then one day , before Ewing had the contract , she had tottered to the stage and taken off , never to show up again . Not at the time or later did Soo Son ever talk about her . Maybe he was pleased she had gone.  |p25One  thing about food put in front of a hungry man  --  it haltered his thought . Grub came first , meat and potatoes and gravy and bread pudding with raisins in it like good-byes from rabbits . Over coffee , then , the mind could worm around some more . Collingsworth ought to be here . He should see how proper the place was . In bigger towns a street would divide the saved from the lost , the sinners from the nonsinners , if any . Lacking the size for such separation , Arfive  --  hurrah  --  had its curtain . Propriety plus . Used to be , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the afternoon , tempting the appetities , drummingup business for themselves and , one move farther on , for the pulpit-pounders , who rejoiced at remorse . It must be discouragingthat not enough were remorseful . But Arfive had removed temptation , or anyhow screened it . The pure people could eat without contamination . If any were weak enough to want to listen , all they would hear were soft murmurs or stifled laughs , for the whores had been warned to be quiet . Yup , a great thing , that curtain . Without it some good citizen , seeing , might lose his virtue or catch a dose at long distance . Ewing paid Soo Son and went out . The men at the Arfive house would be getting impatient . The other members of the school board were there when he entered , even old white-whiskered Sterling McLaine who , if he drank at all , drank at home . Jay Ross looked around as the door swung to , and Merc Marsh lifted a hand . They were n't alone . Fatty Adlam , the barkeep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's mind that to them the bar was as central as a corral to a corral-balky horse . The place had the smell , not of hay and horse manure , but of spilled booze and baths not taken . And here , moving up as Ewing started toward Ross , was Sarge Kraker , the fool deputy sheriff , with the gun proud on hisp26hip that his position made seemly . He had , Ewing recognized , quite a load on . " Well , old Post Mortem , " he asked , " how 'd you make out with the sister ? " Ewing looked him over . Without a position , without a sixshooter , he would come down to size  --  a tolerated no-good who attracted a fringe of ragtags because he was brash . More than his badge , the revolver set him up in a land where commonmen did n't wear arms anymore , unless against wolves and coyotes and rattlesnakes . " He did n't break any laws , " Ewing replied . Then , answeringto the little beat in him , he added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ass . Not yet . " He pushed on by . The other members followed him to a felt-covered table in the rear where men played poker or solo . It was unoccupied now . Though not private , it was separated from the bar by a narrow archway . They sat down , not speaking . Their eyes asked enough , more than he wanted to answer . Ross chomped the end off a cigar . Old Mr. McLaine rested his arms on the table . Except that he was n't , Mere Marsh might have been thinking of businessat the Arfive Mercantile Store . Fatty Adlam came to the table , carrying his great belly lightly , as if , like a balloon , it had nothing in it but air . Ewing ordered a beer and set about rolling a cigarette . Finally a word came out from alongside Ross 's cigar . " Well ? " " You seen him . " " Just a peek . " Ross waved his smoke . " And the others did n't . " It was easiest , if least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He 's square-faced , medium tall and , I would say , built for action . Not puny by a hell of a sight . " Marsh asked , " What do you mean action ' ? "  | " That 's what we were scared of , was n't it  --  gettin ' a feller who 'd take low and go down ? " They nodded , their minds probably back on the nights they had spent wondering what kind of a man would teach school . " Nevertheless , " old Mr. 1'IcLaine said , " looks do n't prove anything . " So they did n't . What was wanted was an untroubled judgment , clear as word from on high , exact as Mere Marsh 's ledgers . All right . He was exaggerating . They only wanted assurance . That came first . But beyond it and in him was a kind of unease , a feeling , somehow , of shift all around . He said , " If ever I saw one , he 's a champeen swimmer . " Ross asked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , Ross had the face of a frog , the broad jaw , the wide mouth and eyes that demanded an answer . He told them then about the accident and about Collingsworth'shelp . He told them in full , almost . Why tattletale the abuse of a horse ? " Good . Fine , " Marsh said when the story was finished . In agreement the other two went down and up with their heads . " You have told us something . " Old Mr. McLaine stroked his paper-white beard . " Time will tell . But his real qualifications , Mr. Ewing ? Did you perhaps catch a glimmer ? " " How in hell would I catch it ? Of all of us you 're the only one educated . " Mr. McLaine pulled some more at his beard . A fine , old gentleman , retired from the New York bar and come west to be with his kinsfolk , a sometime helper with deeds and contractsand legal advice , but first of all a reader with a library from which Ewing had borrowed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I know the range of your interests . " " All I can say is I found him right interesting . My hunch says amen.  | " And still , Mr. Ewing , you seem not quite comfortable . " " It 's not about qualifications . " " What , then ? " " Nothing . Anyhow , I got a lesson in manners . " Ross 's boring eyes were sly . " From his missus ? " " Uh-huh . And from another lady , maybe four years old , maybe six . " They did n't ask him the how of it , perhaps thinking he was just joshing  --  which was n't the whole truth . " I do n't reckon he 's one of us or ever will be , " he said , moving a hand to take in the saloon . " Not like in here . And he kind of kicked over the traces when I named Eva Fox . " Ross asked , " So you think that 's against him ? Like we 'd asked him to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him for class . " Ross had two daughters , one ready for high school , one just about . Ewing smiled a small smile . A big one would n't be right . " I know , Jay . " His voice trailed off to itself . " Manners . Change . " " Sure , that 's progress . But one man cuts such a swathe ? " " Not one man , " Mr. McLaine put in , " not one man alone , but time and men and growing up or merely growing older . We have law and order here of sorts , a wide-open law and order which countenances drunkenness and gambling and fistfightsand brothels . And despair and tragedy , sometimes , sometimes too often . " The old man shook his head . " I have seen its coming , long before now . The winds are blowing . " " To where ? " Ross asked . " I want a clean town , much as anyone else . But do n't tell me the winds blow to an end of saloons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His bold eyes were incredulous . " Not the end of a friendly game now and then . " " No , " Mr. McLaine answered . " Not that but a curb . A division , even an antagonism , between mannerly people andp29those not so mannerly . It is in the nature of things as camps grow older . First , lawlessness , then loose law and order , then churches and schools and social sanctions and , finally , a town , not a camp . The preacher and the schoolmaster are harbingers , and homesteaders will hasten the change . " Ross said , " Christ Jesus , they 'll die away , those homesteaders ! But all the same we can do with some manners . " Old Mr. McLaine had said it , had cut out and branded it , if not altogether . It seemed all a matter of manners . How you dressed . Where you went . Whether you partook . Whether you paid for a hump or got it for nothing and legal . Matter of manners . Matter of attitudes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ma'am , and how are the children and I 'll see you in church . Good-bye to the old free and easy . Just as well , maybe better  --  but it was his age that could say so . Ross asked him , pushing back his chair , " Goin ' out to the ranch ? " " No . It 'll keep . Got to see if my stage driver 's come sober . " At the ranch he could have finished the book about a boat , Beagle , written by a man name of Darwin . Before they could rise , Kraker interrupted . He came up with the swagger of a man who alone carried a gun . From behind him his heelers were watching . His voice was over hearty . " Court about to adjourn ? " For a moment they were silent , wondering like himself , Ewing knew , how to answer a jackass . It was Mr. McLaine who did . " I was not aware , " he said , speaking clipped like a lawyer , " that you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a free American testify ? " " Only if he qualifies as a witness . " " Oh , I qualify , " Kraker said , and grinned back at his retinue . " And here 's my testimony . A man schoolteacher ! Well , piss against the wind ! "  |p30The  mannerly son of a bitch ! Ewing kicked himself back and got up , shoving against Kraker for room . His voice came out low . " You leave him alone ! " Now he had it . He had his report . " He 's a man ! "  | " GOOD MORNIN ' , missus . " Mr. Ewing stood at the door . His smile was small and tentative , as if apology for his intrusion shaped and shortened it . " Good morning , " May Collingsworth answered . She put a hand to her hair , knowing it must be a sight . " Please come in . He hesitated . " Awful early to be callin ' . Is Professor around ? " " He ought to be here any time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He stepped back , saying , " Well , now , " but entered as she swung the door wider . She took him into the little parlor and motioned him to a scat . The house was n't bad , she thought , but not fit for companyyet , not in their first morning in it . It was furnished after a fashion and would look still better when their own belongingsarrived . " Little skimpy , " Benton had said last night , his good heartiness in contrast to his words . She wished Mr. Ewing had given her time to sort and put away the things they had brought . " Everything all right ? " His hat swung between thumb and finger . " We 're so pleased with the house . "  | " Where 's the little lady ? " " Mary Jess ? Oh , in back . She 's learning to jump rope . And Tommie 's taking his morning nap . " " Good , " he said , as if that were the only word he could find . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No driving stage today ? " " My regular driver come out of a sick spell . " It was in some exaggeration of ladyship , she supposed , that he did n't mention the man had been drunk , as Benton had told her . " I 'm headed for the ranch , " he went on , " but thought I 'd drop by here first . Anything wantin ' , missus ? " She shook her head . " People have been so good . " He gave a flip to his hat , dismissing generosity . " I reckon other folks will be comin ' by . Ca n't wait to see you all . " " We want to get acquainted  --  and soon . " " Yes , ma'am . Now any time I can help  --  " " I know . We can count on you . " " Sure ' nough . " A man old but not old . Forty or thereabouts . Weatherwornwas better . Weatherworn and , for no good reason , uncomfortable . Benton had called him surprising . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of himself unrevealed  --  that part that was his alone . But , then , who did n't except man and wife ? He rose from the chair . " Be sure to tell Prof I come by . " Be sure to tell him , as if not telling him would sully honor , or might . It was to laugh , as Benton sometimes said . She saw him to the door and watched him stride down the front path and swing on a saddle horse . He lifted a hand in good-bye . She stood a minute after closing the door , telling herself again that the place was all right , if untidy . It was frame , with curlicues festooned along the top of the front porch . It had a yard and picket fence and an old barn in back . Hop vinesp33shielded the walkway to the privy . There was a thing the unmetfriends had forgotten  --  bed vessels . One could fancy , smiling , that they thought higher education erased the lower needs . She hoped Benton had unbent enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bedrooms and kitchen , where dirty clothes waited , where water was heating that she 'd drawn from the pump just outside and poured into a tub on top of the wood-and-coal range . Fuel , the friends had n't forgotten . She was putting things to soak when Benton called from the front door . " Hi-ho , Maysie . " For an instant she thought he was alone . " Visitors . " She dried her hands on her apron and left the apron on . It at least was fresher than the dress underneath . With Benton was a man  --  was n't he the one named Ross ?  --  and a woman in a flowered hat who wore gloves . Benton had his arms full of parcels . " I was lucky enough to encounter them just outside , " he said . " You 've seen Mr. Ross , Maysie , and here 's Mrs. Ross with him . Excuse me while I take these things to the kitchen . " He hitched his burdens , and it was then that a sack fell and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the bare floor . He looked at May , stricken , while the blood climbed in his face . May laughed and picked the dreadful thing up . Benton marched past her , leaving it dangling from her hand . To his back Ross said , " What 's wrong , Prof ? Never seen a thundermugin your life ? " Ross  --  she must remember to call him Mr. Ross  --  was in a black business suit and carried a derby hat . " Please come in , " she said . When she had them seated was time enough to put down the bed vessel . Mrs. Ross had hardly smiled . Neither did she show embarrassment . She had , May thought , the air of a woman who hadp34changed and washed many a diaper . Wind and sun or something had etched little wrinkles on her face , sad-looking wrinklesfrom which she gazed with sad-looking eyes . But her back was straight and her expression not fearful , and she wore her smart and no doubt expensive linen dress in quiet style . Altogether , she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught sight of the vessel that now sat on the floor like proof of disaster . And all of a sudden he laughed his good laugh . It sometimes happened that way after little misadventures had vexed him . " Fierce , huh ? " he asked . " Fierce , " meaning comical or outlandish , was one of his words . " We do hope you 'll be comfortable , " Mrs. Ross said . " Oh , we are . We will be . Everyone 's so friendly . Why would n't we be ? " " Yes . I suppose . " " Sure , you ca n't help but be . " Mr. Ross apparently felt his wife 's words needed enforcement . As if somewhat impatient , he wiped a skull on which , May remarked again , not much hair grew . " A man could look a long time and not even tie this place . " " Men do like it , " Mrs. Ross added . May asked , " But not women ? " " You may find it lonely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Loneliness and the wind . " " Aw , stop that stuff , Frances , " Mr. Ross said . Loneliness and the wind , and a woman ranch-fettered , work-marked , weather-branded . The years receding like distance . Hope of joys forever elusive . Loneliness and the wind in a smart linen dress . And no love . That had to be it . No binding love . Mr. Ross bit the end from a cigar , put the end in his pocket and lighted up . When May returned with a saucer to be usedp35as an ashtray , he was saying , " Now , Prof , you got two young ones . " " Mary Jess and Tommie . " " So what do you need ? What first ? " " We have what we need , within limits . " " No , sir , you do n't . " Mr. Ross blew out a thoughtful plume of smoke , then asked , " You savvy how to juice a cow ? " " If I know  --  " " Pail one , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milking . May thought she detected a flicker of distaste on Mrs. Ross 's face . " How to milk ? Any Hoosier does . " " All right . What you goin ' to milk unless she 's a cow ? " That 's first . " " In time , I suppose . I thought we could buy milk . " " Not easy . Not likely . Now and then , maybe . Not regular . " He puffed again . " The barn you got here is good enough . " " But pasture . " Mr. Ross quit smoking for a minute and laughed a wheezing laugh . " Pasture ? Good Lord , Prof , there 's pasture all around . Just turn the cow loose . She 'll find grass . And once she knows there 's bran waiting for her , why , come milking time , she 'll likely mosey on home . " He studied the band on his cigar as if to find the right words there . " Generally , that is . But once a month or so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You know how cows are . Most all creation , far as that goes . Again Mrs. Ross might have shown the shadow of aversion . " I am not in position to buy one . " Benton was shying away . " Not yet . " " Who mentioned buying ? I got an extra at the ranch , halfp36Jersey . Hard enough to get the men to milk one cow , let alone two . You can borrow her . If you like her , keep her . " Not until Mary Jess entered did May know she 'd left the back yard . She asked of everybody , " Are we going to have a cow ? " May said , " Mary Jess , you have n't met Mr. and Mrs. Ross . " Before the child could say as much as hello , Mr. Ross boomed , " You bet you are . A nice cow . Come over here , littlesister . I been hearing about you . " Mary Jess walked right to him . He lifted her to his knee . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Mr. Ross held his cigar away after she had knuckled her nose . " Well , now , I have girls , two of them , but bigger than you . They named her Dearie . " Mary Jess clasped her hands . The title to the cow might have been in them . Benton put in , " But see here , Mr. Ross  --  " " Jay 's the name . " It was n't that Benton did n't want or need the cow . It was the thought of involvement , of lessening the freedom which he called being his own man . A gift , she knew , seemed to him like losing a part of possession . " Well , Jay , then  --  it is generous of you but not necessary . I 'll buy the cow . " And what with ? " Let 's let time tell , huh ? " She had made up her mind about Mr. Ross , calling him a boor and what not , and yet he had understood and said the right thing . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's fresh enough . " " Do you mean she 's new ? " Mary Jess asked . " No . No . Not that . " Once more the wheezing , the really whistling , laugh sounded . " Fresh means she 's had a baby . "  | " Oh . " Her sober eyes studied the case . " Fresh like Mamma ? " May 's head bent of itself . Into the silence came Benton 's raw voice . " That 's enough of questions . " From under her upper lids May could see that the child 's eyes still asked for an answer . Mr. Ross puffed deep on his cigar and blew rings of smok : : and stuck the cigar in the center of one . Mary Jess was n't diverted . " I should have said it 's a calf . " There might have been a glint in the glance Mr. Ross shied at her . " This one , why , he cats grass . " He deposited Mary Jess , got up and put on his derby . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door . " I want to take you to the ranch as soon as you 're settled , " she said to May . Her voice seemed to carry the lonely murmur of wind . " And , if it 's all right , I 'll come to see you when I 'm in town ? " " Of course . Please do . Any time . " A small smile contracted the wrinkles . Then Mrs. Ross started to turn , thought better of it and bent to say into Mary Joss 's ear , " Your mother is beautiful . " They were hardly out of hearing before Mary Jess said , " Father , she told me Mamma was beautiful . " " Of course she is . Did n't you know that ? " Mary Jess retreated a step and pressed the back of her head into May 's apron . The act seemed almost defensive and somehow altogether pitiful . " She 's Mamma . " Well , it was done , or some part of it . The washing . The hanging on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of lamp chimneys . The filling of lamps . The care and nursing of Tommie , who looked frail and slept maybe too much . The sweeping and dusting . The visit , made hasty , ofp38the next-door neighbor , who spoke friendliness in wretched English and asked if Mary Jess could n't come play with her girl . The firing and shaking down of the range . The cleaning up of it . The making of a sketchy meal in between times . The disposition of Benton 's purchases , including those evil necessities , bed vessels . Benton , for what he called homecoming , had splurged on a round steak , which she 'd have to beat tender with the edge of a plate , having no hammer . And he 'd bought potatoes , a small one of which she had used to stopper the stopperless kerosene can , and canned tomatoes and dried peaches and dried apples and dried apricots and dried limas and Sundaybreakfastsalt mackerel and dill pickles , a nickel 's worth . Other things , too , all expensive , such as canned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did Arfive never savor a muskmelon ? When Benton tried to help around the house  --  which was n't often and should n't be  --  he was funny . He could n't even fry an egg right or a strip of bacon , always using too much heat and ending up with " Confound it ! " But he was good about dumping the slops and bringing in coal and wood , though he sometimes forgot . There was still supper to get , an ample one , for Benton ate well , and a myriad of things to do , now and later , if she set herself to them ; but first she would freshen up  --  that word again , now to be smiled at  --  and change her housedress . Benton had gone to see a man he called Mr. McLaine . She felt draggy but would not complain . It was better for everybody if she wore a bright face . And she would be sprightliersoon . It was the first few weeks , held secret for some reason , maybe uncertainty , maybe first and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all the things done that time and strength would allow , there would be bed , and there would be Benton.  |p39All  right . Right , no more and no less . Right , and often expected , and right . In her head , as many a time before , ran the words : Doubt truth to be a liar ; But never doubt I love . That much she remembered from Hamlet . That much was cherishedand true . She was about to put on her dress when she heard Benton come in . She hoped he had borrowed a book . He was lost without something to read . But his footfalls led to the kitchen and then out the rear door , and she knew he 'd rememberedabout slops and fuel . Ile had these chores done when she came out of the bedroom with a smile she had put on for him . He looked her over and said , " Well ! " and smiled , too ; and a knock came at the front door . He added , " Oh , no . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just outside . In a big voice the man sang out , " Brother Collingsworth , welcome ! I am your pastor , John Wesley Harrison , and here is my wife . " Benton shook hands , nodding . " Please come in . " " And here 's your better half . " Though May had n't offered her hand , he extended his . His grip seemed to want to seal a compact in righteousness . In soft tones Mrs. Harrison said , " We 're so happy you 've come to Arfive . " She was , May thought with a touch of guilt , a preacher 's wife all right  --  small , somewhat dumpy , faintspokenbecause it was her man , not herself , who had heard the call and uttered the Word . " A great boon to us , your coming , " Mr. Harrison said in that big voice , a voice that seemed bigger because it mismatchedhis size . She thrust from her head the memory of a little man who had been one of Indiana 's champion hog callers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Come in and be seated . " But it was a little time before she could get them to enterp40the parlor , for Mr. Harrison had put his arm across Benton 's shoulders and was saying , " It 's no accident that you are a Methodist . It 's an answer to prayer . " He patted Benton 's back . Inside his clothes , May knew , Benton was flinching . He disliked effusiveness and hated familiarity . When they were seated , Mr. Harrison went on in his pulpit tones , " We are a little church , naturally . " His gesture was n't quite deprecatory . " A little church , but we have put our hand to the plow . " He had an earnest face , she decided , earnest and innocent and artlessly lined , as if all the furies had left him in untoucheddedication . " Not so small , " Mrs. Harrison dared interject . " Ten families , at least . " " And more to be saved . Brother Collingsworth , have you noticed the names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few . " " Well , I can tell you . They 're solid American names . Hardly a Roman in the lot . And not a black man in a hundred miles . " He paused as if to let the information sink in . " Nevertheless , we are a wicked town . Saloons and  --  other places . So many souls to be rescued ! " " And bodies , too , I presume . " Benton 's inflection was as dry as his words . On Mr. Harrison 's face showed a brief astonishment . Already , May suspected , they were on the border of disagreement . Ahead of hell's-fire evangelism and its questionableyield of straggling and individual souls brought to Jesus , Benton put an earthly and virtuous society . " Yes . Of course . " Apparently Mr. Harrison had resolved his bewilderment . " One and the same in a way , since the body is the temple of the soul . Brother Collingsworth , " he proceeded , that point having been settled , " you have no idea how refreshing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often , it seems to me , our institutions of learning foster doubt if not downright unbelief . I pray for them . " Benton answered , " Heaven help them ! " " Right , and God bless you . Heaven help them . I say to the educated doubters , Read the Bible . It has the answers . ' " She watched Benton and kept silent . Mr. Harrison got to his feet . Mrs. Harrison came up as if pulled by a string . Her voice seemed like the demure anticipation of his . " We really must be going . " May asked  --  Tommie was crying  --  " So soon ? " Again Mr. Harrison put his hand on Benton 's shoulder . " You will be a tower in the church , Brother Collingsworth . " Benton neither shook nor nodded his head . He just drew away from the patting hand . " A tower . And of course we will see you at services Sunday . " " ... for Sunday is the fit completion of an ill-spent week , and not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What did you say ? " " I did n't . Thoreau did . " " Thoreau ? I do n't believe I know him . " " He died in 1862 . " " Oh , a writer , I suppose . Frankly , between the Bible and religious periodicals I find little time for reading . " Benton almost smiled . " He was a lover of nature . " " Good . Fine . " Mr. Harrison spoke with the assurance of regained footing . " But it 's hardly the same as loving our Lord , is it ? " They left then , after polite good-byes , and Benton closed the door and turned . His face wore a look she knew from before . " Encore , " he said through a tight mouth . " Jesus rides again on an ass 's back . "  |p42THE  ROYAL COACHMAN , Collingsworth decided , worked best , at least for this time and this water , though the half dozenother flies he had tried lured trout almost as well . Not trout but Trouts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for calling fly-casting dibbling or for classifying lures under such names as gnats and cow dungs . A fish struck at his fluttering Coachman , and he snapped back too soon and felt in his fist the message of failure . He cast again . Sometime , somewhere , someone , some poet , had given later and lovely names to the temptations offered to Trouts . The t Royal Coachman , the Ginger Quill , the King and the Queen of Waters , the Parmachene Belle and the Grizzly King . A littlething called the Professor caught fish , too , but its name lacked enchantment . It belonged in the company of gnats . Now he had a fish , firmly hooked , and he brought it to shore and got it in hand and put his rod aside and felt for his pocketknife . He slipped the small blade through the trout 's gills and , pressing up , cut its backbone . Stopped suffering . Stopped drowning in air . He had caught enough , a nice mess , a dozen , not big but beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gunny sack he used for a creel . They slithered lubricouslyp43against one another and found resting places in the grass and looked at him from their pupiled sides . Silver and soft rust and pupils  --  their great gift before the last gift to frying pan , platter and appetite . He gutted them carefully . Once he had them back in the bag , he washed and dried his knife and hands and sat back . It was the shank of the afternoon , the feeding time , and other fish were dimpling the water , which here was quiet , backed up by a beaver dam . A fish hog probably could land a hundred or more . Milk and honey , he thought , and Moses dead too soon for enjoyment . In less than a half mile , whipping , until just now , only the holes , the bright , blue holes of the Breast , he 'd caught supper . The Breast was better than Walton 's Dove  --  but try , if you could , to convince the compleat angler of that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the beginning of school , he had learned a good deal about fishing for trout . And how much better it was than flinging out set lines or stringing trot lines or , for that matter , still fishing with a prayerful eye on the bobber ! And how much cleaner ! No messing with worms or minnows or craw tails . Just the aseptic , artificial fly . Here , while admiring the language , he inclined to leave Mr. Walton : " But if you be nice to foul your fingers , which good anglers seldom are ... " A V 'd riffle troubled the water , its dark point moving with purpose ; and now he could see the legs working and the flat tail idle in tow . A beaver , his first one , unmistakable . He breathed softly , not moving until the pistol spank of the tail startled him . Left to see was only a wash in the pond , a riffled memory of what might have been . The trout started rising again , and the out-of-sight fledgling magpies that had been trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another time , looking for beaver sign and setting his traps and in his hunt giving names to strangep44streams and finding passes that later generations would travel . But for beaver he might not be here himself . He saluted the dying riffle , glad that one of his creditors lived . If that former time was good , this time was good enough , this time and this place . That poor , often-right , sometimeseloquentNew Englander , Thoreau , whose aim was a life with wide margins and whose feet , left to themselves , always pointed him west but did n't carry him far . Here were his margins . Here was his west . Collingsworth twisted his head around and gazed beyond the open bank that he sat on , not to make sure but to see again . There was the purple wall of the Rockies , spired in the yonder of yonders , distant but as close as one 's yearnings . And there , hard against vicissitudes , stood Elephant Ear Butte like proof of forever . To the east , beyond the grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Beyond the mere saying , a man could fall in love with a country . He almost had it . It was there almost for the reaching  --  no , for absorption  --  the ultimate why of the world , the answer , the revelation . Wait . And wait uplifted , this close to knowing . Wait and look on valley and pond and peak and feel the touch of the sun . In other years and other places farther from disclosure he had sat with Charlie , neither of them speaking , and felt the breath of intimation while his bobber rode the water . Charlie 's slow words were n't said to break the spell . " Nice , huh , Bent ? Nice . " " Nice . " Charlie , older brother , Big Bear to everyone , first in fun and first in fights and fierce in name of family . Charlie , the immortal , who had gone to fight the Spanish and been shot down by syphilis and never took to sea . " Nice , huh , Bent ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his parents had seemed to think . Just do n't talk about it and do n't speak of Charlie 's illness to outsiders even if they ask about it . Just say he 's gettingwell . But even now his mind could see the evil chancre Charlie showed him when no others were about . And he could see the later rash and Charlie 's eyes sunk deep , and he could hear the voice , once bold and cheerful , saying : " Take a lesson from me , Bent . See how I 'm paying for my fun . Bent , little brother , keep your tallywhacker in your pants . " Every day the village doctor came , an old befuddled man who mostly shook his head and lacked faith in his own prescriptions . It was n't syphilis that killed Charlie , though : chronic malariawon the race  --  which may have made his passing more respectable . Still , reason might argue that the wages of sin should be levied by a related collector . Why , Collingsworth wondered now , should his mind have swung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing up he had dwelt enough on chancres and rashes and shameful disease . He had been terrified by the thought of them but , do n't forget , disciplined , too . Weigh fear against discipline and count discipline a net gain . Charlie , made whole , sat with him on the bank again under the soft , close Indiana sky . God was good , and this time was nice ; and from the rear came a voice . " What you doing , Prof ? Just chewing your cud ? " Jay Ross sat a saddle horse , a fly rod in one hand . He wore a stained , open vest . Fishhooks without feathers stuck from the band of his battered hat . " Hello , Jay . Guess so . Chewing so hard I did n't even hear you ride up . " " How they biting ? " " I never saw the like . "  | " Good . You 're afoot , of course . " " What else ? And why not ? It 's hardly more than a stroll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , and for an instant was silent , his mind on some matter . " Being so close to my ranch house , you could have dropped in . " " Sorry , Jay . I cut in south of your house , not wanting to bother you . " " ' S ' all right . But I got hired hands to do the work . " Ross thrust a thumb and finger in his vest pocket andbrought out a piece of bait and hooked it in place . Collingsworth asked , " What are you using ? " " Grasshopper heads . They 're hunky-dory . " " Why just the heads ? " Now a smile split Ross 's squat face . " You , an educated man , asking me that , Prof ! What does a grasshopper do ? He hops , do n't he ? Gets out of your pocket and away from your fingers often as not . Ever see a head hop ? " Still smiling , Ross kicked his horse into the water . When it was knee deep he started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slap of line , and almost at once a fish took it . He brought it in and up and disengaged it and dropped it in a sack looped over the saddle horn , where it flapped as a killed trout did not . Collingsworth picked up his catch . " Good luck , jay . High time I was starting for home . " " So long , " Ross answered while he hooked on a fresh grasshopperhead . " Remember to drop by whenever you can , you and the family . Oh , hell , I forgot . Just tell me when , and I 'll drive a rig in . Any time . " He added as if here were a thing beyond comprehension , " The wife , she gets lonesome . " Walking away , Collingsworth thought he knew why . Ross spent too much time in town , often at cards , it was said . For company Mrs. Ross had the two daughters , who would be inp47and out , here and gone and self-concerned in the manner of youth . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she had told May . But there was something pathetic about Ross , about this assured , bold-eyed man who seemed not to understand . Call him a vulgarian , if you wished , but an honest vulgarian unconsciousof his insensitivity . In his repeated invitations to drop by the house , to come out for dinner , there could be a sort of appeal . There could be a wish for undefined help . Whatever he was , number him as a friend . And be glad . He pushed through a thicket and saw the town lying mellowin the long light of late afternoon , and it occurred to him that , without his willing so , his spirit had lifted again . Ross was wrong : heads hopped . Gone were Charlie and his illness and the old fears he 'd lived with . At his side was a pretty catch , and the sun warmed his back , and the deep sky was glory . A man could fall in love with a country . One had . He was amused to find himself singing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Yip  --  i  --  dee , Yip  --  i  --  da , As through an Alpine village passed , Yip  --  i  --  dee  --  i  --  da  --  To the valley about him , to the mountains behind , to the sky above , he yelled , " Excelsior . " He strode through the thigh-high redtop in the bottom , through the thigh-high timothy growing wild and quickened his pace toward home . May would be there.  |p48IT  WAS a good day , not hot , not cold , just comfortable , Mort Ewing reflected as he climbed into his buckboard and sat down and idled a minute . The country could stand a rain  --  hell , Montana always could  --  but there was moisture enough for the time , barring a dry wind from the southwest . Though the ridges had turned summer tan , the mown fields had greened up . The two hands he 'd kept on after haying was over sat in the sun on a bench outside the bunkhouse , digesting the noon meal and smoking away the few minutes of leisure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of all creatures he knew , it was only a fool chicken that sang of a drop . Before he clucked to the team , he spoke again to Dune McDonald . " Positive you jotted down everything ? " McDonald grinned and took his hand from a corral pole to reach for his sack of tobacco . " Positive , boss . You sure you got the list ? " Ewing felt in his vest pocket . " Right there . " " Do n't forget the thread for the missus . Last time she blamed me . " " If that 's all you ever get blamed for  --  "  |p49Turning  , McDonald said , " Ought to get the last of the stacks fenced today . " A good foreman , a good man with a good wife who knew how to fix grub . Lucky to have them . Lucky to own a betterthan-fairranch , two solid houses , one occupied by McDonald , and a bunkhouse and whatever was necessary , all kept up and tidy . Ewing spoke to the horses . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked when he filed on the home place . " You 're sure hell for rocks , " they had said when he added to it . They had n't imagined , perhaps because of the cost , that the Titty could or would be drawn on to water it ; and they had n't known and he could n't be sure that gravel bar plus irrigation added up to wild hay . Everybody knew now . The horses trotted along , used to the road through the one or two trips to town every week . Off to the sides cows turned their slow looks on him , and spring calves suckled or followed suit , the R5 prints of the branding iron still showing bold on their young hides . An old codger with plenty of money , he thought ; and he would stock up at Mere Marsh 's store and have a drink or two and maybe play poker at the Arfive House and maybe  --  just maybe  --  naw , not Eva Fox . A man 's mind ought to grow old along with his body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought not to embarrass the school or the Collingsworths , though he guessed Eva could keep up with Prof in talk about books . She had taught in a couple of camps to the south of here until the good people had found she had too hot a crotch for the classroom . So she 'd gone to paid whoring , likely without shame or apology , and in time set up a house in Arfive , where the need was great in spite of some willow-smoked squaws . So what of it ? It was to be expected . It was inevitable , the more so in a place where the tally of men against women ran maybe two top50one . You might say it was necessary . It was better than the rape of your fillies , good people , better even than the rape of an Indian girl that the law did n't torment or hang you for , Indians being Indians . There came to mind a time long ago when he had been riding with some young , randy harum-scarums who knew the customs ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and all but him had charged after her , the followersshouting to the lead rider . Their old , their young cries sounded again . " Catch her ! Catch her , Jake , before she sands ! " Watching , he saw the girl run , saw her , before Jake ran her down , snatch up a handful of soil , hoist her skirt and jam the dirt into herself . Dismounted , Jake slapped the girl to the ground and got back on his horse , but before they rode on he asked as if nobody in his senses could answer , " What do they want to do that for ? Goddam ! " They went away grumbling but agreed on one point : as a book might put it , sex and sand were not compatible . Better , he reflected now , to have Eva Fox and her house  --  which was a long way from claiming that everything at Arfive was jim-dandy or ever would be , new high school or not or whatever . According to possibilities a man could stand up for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hitch rack at the side of the Arfive Mercantile , tied the team and went in . The place was a clutter of canned goods and dry goods and work clothes and pitchforks and assorted containers , and it smelled , not unpleasantly , of coal oil and cured fish and candy and leather and of a wheel of cheese freshly cut into . Mere Marsh came up and gave him the time of day . He was a small man , and prudent , who wore black sleeve protectors at work and an eyeshade with a band that hugged an alwaysp51sharp pencil . He had n't really wanted to be on the school board , maybe fearing that matters might come up detrimental to business . " Here 's a list of things , " Ewing said . " The rig 's out at the side . Reckon one of your boys will load up the plunder ? " " Of course . Of course , Mort . " Marsh took the list and stood fiddling with it as if he had more than the order in mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mere ? " " Nothing important . " Marsh gave one little shake of his head . " Brother Collingsworth seems to be making out . " " Brother Collingsworth ? " " That 's what the preacher calls him . Seems he 's going to teach the Bible class and sing in the choir . According to the reverend , I mean . " " So ? I did n't look for him to sing Sweet Adeline ' at the Family Liquor Store . " " No . Sure not . But what old Mr. McLaine said in the first place kind of bothers me . You know , about change and the town choosing up sides . " " Shoulder your blunderbuss , Merc ! Tomorrow comes gunplay . " Ewing paused . " Hell ! " Marsh said , " All the same , I do n't like change . " " It comes slow , like gray hair and rheumatics and the coolin ' off of your breeches . " Marsh was n't amused . " I just hope our Prof is n't too for-ward . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No plus or minus , eh , Merc ? Just a plain cipher. " " just a good teacher . " " He 'll be that , I bet , and maybe more . Anyhow , I got to foot it . Do n't forget the order . " As Ewing started away , Marsh 's voice halted him . " Nicolas 13rudd 's in town . "  | " Up goes the price of whiskey , by glass or by jug . Is that it ? " Marsh shook his head . " Just renewing acquaintance with customers and also asking around , wanting to get up a game . " Ewing walked away , saying over his shoulder , " Pretty rich for a piker . " It was , too , he thought as he made for the Arfive House . Nicolas Brudd , bigwig from Great Falls , wholesaler with almost a corner on what whiskey came to Arfive , sharp poker player whose constant and fifth ace was his bankroll . In nolimitand even table-stakes games his big bets stayed not-so-fat players . All in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bar , talking to Fatty Adlam , when Ewing entered . Once inside , Ewing paused . " Come in , " Adlam said . " I might start a saloon . " " Waitin ' on my eyes , you keep it so dark . " Waiting , he put Brudd together  --  chicken-hawk nose over gray line of mustache , head bald as a china knob under that hat , indoor and grubworm complexion , sagged shoulders , rich belly , rich watch chain , rich boots . It slid through his mind , not for the first time , that here was something unpleasant to think of the touch of , like that of an oyster against the bare skin . " Buy you a drink , " Brudd announced . He held out his hand as Ewing approached . They shook . " Thanks . Just a beer , Fatty . " " I been telling Adlam a little about how to run a saloon , " Brudd said . His tone and manner seemed only part joshing . Adlam drew a beer . " Place suits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camp . " Adlam had time to say , " Thanks , Mort . " " None so good it ca n't be better . " Brudd kept his voice on the edge of agreeable . " Look here , " he went on . " I 'll tell you.  |p53A  good saloon man , he promotes business . Let a slow crowd come in , and he sets out a round on the house . Same thing if later the party seems likely to tail off . He lets the roof leak again . " " What difference to you , Brudd ? " Ewing asked . " Here 's how . " He lifted his beer . " You sell to all three saloons . You got the whole town sewed up . " Brudd replied , " How , " and drank . Adlam put his hands on the bar . They were small , neat hands , like the starved tips of his heavy forearms . " I do not choose to run my business your way , " he said to Brudd . " I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Drunks are bad medicine regardless of money . " " Christ help the kindhearted . " " But seeing it 's you two , " Adlam continued , " have a drink on the house . " He served them and stood silent . He must be too fat for comfort , Ewing reflected , yet he moved with light ease , and his hands had light grace . And what was strange to such poundage was dignity . " Do business your way then , Fatty . " Under the chickenhawknose a smile spread the thin line of mustache . " I was just trying to help . " Brudd straightened and faced the door . " Any live ones around ? " " Jay Ross was in earlier . Said sometime today he 'd hook up with Judge Secrest . " " You for a quiet game , Ewing ? " Ewing shook his head . " Thanks . " Brudd walked toward the door . " I 'll see what I can round up . After he had gone , Adlam asked , " How would you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might-and-main dangerous . Likes money , no matter how got . "  | " Likes it enough , was it there , to tank up the town , mammasand babies included . " " Why , sure . " Adlam sighed , leaving himself looking shrunken by more than the breath . " It makes a man wonder  --  a man in my spot . " " It makes a man wonder . " After another sigh Adlam asked , " Crib ? " and at Ewing 's nod reached to the back bar for the cards and the cribbage board . They played half a dozen games , chicken-feed games , and then Ewing called quits . He had time for an afternoon bite at Soo Son 's before dusting off to the ranch . ' Walking to the restaurant , he guessed he should have called on the Collingsworths . Now the hour was too late , and , besides , he did n't reckon Brother Collingsworth would appreciatehim showing up with beer on his breath . There were just two other customers at the Chink 's , drummersby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned Soo Son 's smile . " Pie and coffee , " he said . " Apple ? " " No question , Soo Son . That 's all you got . " " Not light , " Soo Son answered , and reached to the board behind him . He held out an envelope and with the other hand gestured toward the curtain hung between light and darkness . " To you , soon you come , she say . " " Pie and coffee , Soo Son . " On the envelope , written in a sure hand , appeared : Mr. Morton Ewing Kindness of Soo SonInside were just a line and the name he knew would be there . Please , Mort , see me . Evap55IF A MAN wanted to talk to Eva Fox privately , he went up the side steps and knocked at an unlighted door . Beyond the door was a small sitting room into which Eva retreated to rest or to read or to enter in her journals the number of tricks turned by the girls or to talk business unconnected with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfied that the darkness pretty well hid him . Not so long ago , he thought , he would n't have cared . He did n't give too much of a damn now , just enough of a damn not to want to walk open . Mark it down funny . Ile knocked twice without answer and then tried the knob . ' I ' lie door swung to his push . The lighted room was just as remembered . There were a desk and a chair and an easy chair and a sofa and a bookcase c ranumd full . A couple of pictures decorated the walls . She had always been a great one for drawings of castles . It was a f oolishment to imagine she dreamed herself into one of them , palace mistress of a bevy of whores . The floor had a carpet on It and a bearskin with raised head and glass eyes and ivory teeth opened wide for a bite , the gift maybe of some former aclinircr , himself maybe gone , along with hide , eyes and teeth . Eva must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table sat a bottle of whiskey , two glasses and a pitcher of water . On it ,  |p56too  , rested a small , engraved cowbell which , he knew from before , came from France . He poured a drink and sat down . It was early yet , too early for much in the way of high jinks . The voices and laughter that sounded from beyond an interiordoor were subdued , and the piano was silent . He guessed there were a couple of young fellows in there , feeling their oats but shy about sowing them . A few drinks , and they 'd be loud and lusty . Trust the girls to oblige with the booze . The old saying was that a man had it made if he treated the nice girls like whores and the whores like nice girls . Like other wisdom , it was n't so wise . Like honor thy father and mother , no matter how mean . He picked up the bell . It rang to his one shake , rang not loud but pure and reaching and fetchful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before it quit singing , Eva came in . " It 's good of you to call , Mort , " she said , offering her hand . " Sit down . Sit down . Of all the men in Arfive you 're the only one who uncovers and gets up when a lady approaches . " " Not quite , " he said , and settled back in his chair . " The new schoolteacher would . " For a second the words seemed to stop her , seemed to put in her eyes more than the mere comment called for , but all she said was , " Oh . " She rounded the desk and took her businesswoman'schair and looked at him . Both time and her trade had been kind to her . Always a sizable woman , she weighed only a pound or three more than he first remembered , and her face was still cleanly defined and had none of the puffiness that so often seemed to afflict the profession . Even in repose it was lively , and her brown eyes , even level-aimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She wore a black outfit high in the collar and relieved it with just one white breastpin . No necklace , nop57bracelets , no rings . A man never close to her might have thought her unwomanish . She said , " Sweeten your drink , Mort , and pour me one , please . " " Two fingers and two fingers of water . " " Good memory . " After he had fixed the drinks and sat down , she said , " You 've come a long way in life , Mort . " As if to prick him , she added , " Even the town 's named after your brand . " " Aw , stop it . You know the town was named before ever I bought that old brand . But did you call me here just to puff me up ? No . " She put her elbows on the desk and rested her chin in her hands , taking time for her answer . " Did I ever ask you a favor , Mort ? " " I 'm obliged to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It is n't . " Again she appeared to hunt words . " What good is your money to you ? " " To spend . To be comfortable on . To see to my old age and bury me proper . Now what in hell 's the idea ? " " You never married and so gave a poor girl a home . " He had to smile . To irritate her , he asked , " You want to get married ? " " Jesus Christ , no ! " If she got worked up enough , her languagewould jump clean over the fence . " Then who 's the lucky lady ? " " You never got on a ripsnorting spree and threw your money around . " " Not lately . Should I ? " " And never sat in a game that lost you even your saddle . " he rose to pour two more drinks , knowing Eva would n't come to her point until she got good and ready . No good to prompt her . No good to push . Be patient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He skirted around the ivory teeth of thep58bear and the glaring glass eyes , saying , " That 's an ugly bitch of a thing . " Eva might not have heard him . She just nodded in thanks as he set her glass down . He moved back to his chair . " Next chapter . " There was a little silence . " Mort , how long have you lived in this country ? " It was an idle question , and he answered her idly . " All my life . Born in Kentucky , baptized in Oklahoma , consecrated in Texas , sanctified in Montana . What else ? " " You got here early , " she said , as if she had not heard him . " You were smarter than most men and still are . Better educated , though you stick to your old cowpuncher lingo . And more industrious than most . You arrived at the right time , and you saw farther and did more . " " That 's handsome , Eva . Dock off a few words and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward . " And you hogged the water ! " " Hogged nothing ! There 's a law that reads first in time first in right . " " And you had the first and biggest of the big ditches , and you hogged the water . " " Do I have to explain what you already know ? I took what I needed , sure , and maybe a little to boot . But the court 's acted . The river 's adjudicated . My rights to my water stood and stand up . " He paused , wondering at the drift of all she had said . " What 's the idea , Eva ? You tell me I never got married , never got stumble drunk , never pissed off my roll at a card table . Guilty on all counts , your honor . That adds up to a water hog , does it ? What I did was build up my own place . My men are well paid , my word is good , and no one can say that ever I crooked him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the law . "  |p59Her  voice was softer than her leveled gaze . " There 's a law against fraud , I believe . " " Why , sure thing . " The fingers of one hand played on her desk , going one two three four five , one two three four five . " That 's how you got most of your land , by fraud . No-good cowpunchers filed for you in their names , ranch hands , drunks , even businessmen , people who had n't the get-up or means or desire for homesteadsand ranches and were glad to transfer their titles to you in return for the dollar an acre you paid them . " It had been hard to hold in and allow her to finish . When she had , he said , " Good God Almighty , woman , that was the way of it everywhere . That 's the way of it still , what with the free range going or gone . How else put together a ranch ? My titles are good . Fraud , my ass ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might tend to your whorehouse ? " Of a sudden she laughed . Hers was a big woman 's laugh , a sort of timed chuckle like the sound of a flushed prairie chicken . He felt the fizz leaving him , but before it was gone he said , " That loop you 're swinging wo n't fetch many favors . " She answered , " I hope so , " and counted her fingers some more . " Mort , you 're a good man . I guess you 're the best man I ever met . But when have you looked at yourself ? " " This morning , shaving . Ca n't say I fell in love . " " You did n't see a lucky man and a shrewd one , with land in his name and beef on the hoof and money enough ? You did n't see any self-satisfaction ? " " Just the same old map . " She put her hands together and looked at them and sighed and said , " Maybe I 've gone about this all wrong . Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to see yourself . I wanted you to feel thankful  --  and guilty to boot . "  | " Thankful to who ? " Her hands came apart in an open gesture . " How do I know ? To this country , to good breaks , to your pa and ma having a lay and accidentally teaming up on a mind that you did n't build . Someone deserves something because you got so much . " " Good Christ , " he answered , partly faking outrage , " you talk like a Socialist . I 'd have you remember , ma'am , I 'm straight Republican . " " Straight Ewing . " " Or you talk like something out of a book . One of Bret Harte 's fool stories , maybe . The big-hearted outcast . Eva , the role does n't suit you . " " Do n't you think it might , for once ? " A shadow fell on her face . " Do n't you think it might , for once , for both of us ? " " Eva , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls has a bad dose  --  " She waved that talk aside . " I may be hard up but I take care of my girls . " " All right . What is it ? " " I know you 're an honest and just man , Mort , but how long has it been since you went out of your way to do a kind and generous thing ? " " The Good Samaritan do n't tally his charities . " " There are reasons I ca n't do it myself  --  money , reputation , influence . " " Remember to prod me when you get to your point . " He came to his feet and mixed drinks for them both . Back in his chair he said , " Lot of dusty words on the trail to the rail-head . " " It 's a girl , " she announced then . " One of yours ? " " No , but she 's in the house . "  | " Well , tits on a snake . " " Uh-huh . True all the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lining her thoughts out , point , swing and drag . While he waited for her to go on , he tolled and lighted a cigarette . " She 's all alone , Mort , with never a soul on her side unless you count me . A stranded , lost orphan of fifteen or sixteen . A kid without kin . Goddam , but it makes me mad . " She was so sore put that he had to leave off his fluff talk . " Go ahead , Eva . I 'm riding along . " " Her father was one of those itinerant editors , the kind with a shirttail of type and a headful of classical references  --  just enough stuff to put out a newspaper in camp after camp . Alwaysit was go bust and go on . " " To puff up a new Eden until he ran out of apples . Sure . I3ooze hounds , mostly . " Her head nodded agreement . " He died of the snakes fourmonths ago . That was at Single Tree up close to the border . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ petered out , the camp'son its last legs . I s'pose the girl had a mother ? " " She does n't remember her . I imagine the mother flew the coop once she was rid of her egg . " " So the girl 's here ? " Eva took a deep breath and then , as if one were n't enough , took another . " Whatever her old man was or did , he taught her to read . He gave her a real liking for learning and books . Mort , she 's smart . She 's read everything I have in the house . Maybe it was n't smart for her to come here , but she had a icason . " Which was ? " " Not yet . Not the why of it yet . " " All right . " " So the old man died , and there she was with maybe twop62bits to her name , a frazzle of clothes , one pair of beat-up shoes and a couple of hairpins . That was her inventory , or just about . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work as a hired girl . " He said , " Sensible . " " You think so , do you ? " The blood was rising in her face . " Her boss was some goddam widower with a ranch a day 's ride from nowhere . That son of a bitch raped her , and she just a young girl and unknowing . He raped her not once but again and again . " " Seems like she could have run away . " " She did . He caught her . Why are men such bastards , Mort ? Such dirty bastards ? " It dodged in his head that , but for men , she would n't be a prosperous madam , but he thought of the Indian girl and the sand and said , " Peckers . " " A young hired hand found her crying and guessed at the reason and sneaked her back to Single Tree , riding double on his horse . " " He was n't such a bastard . Must have cost him his job . " She waved the interruption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rides when she could and walked when she could n't and so showed up here . " " What for  --  to ask a dumb question ? " " Up at Single Tree she had heard of my house . " Eva 's mouth came down at one corner . From the side of it she said , " Her drunken newspaper daddy was against sin . " After a pause she added , " But that 's what she came here for , in a way . " Ewing got up and stretched and walked around the bearskinrug , wishing he could hush Eva and get back to the ranch . After he had reseated himself , just tentatively , he said , " Sin 's what she 'll get then . Case dismissed . " She clapped the desk with the palm of her hand andp63brought her head toward him like a bird dog on a point . " No . No . She does n't belong here . " " Plenty of jobs for hired girls . " " For her ! Again ! Good God , Mort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fixed notion about hired-girl jobs from that nightmare position she had . She 'd rather whore , if she could , than be raped . Then she 'd have some say in the matter . " " But she ca n't ? " Eva sighed , and it was as if some of the strength left her . " I could stand another drink . " After he had served them she went on , not looking at him but at the top of the desk where words and the records of deeds might have been . " I let her try twice , Mort , and both times she came crying later to me , and the customers complainedand demanded other girls free . She could n't cut the mustard , that 's all . " " Not one swath , huh ? " " I guess not . Anyhow , who wants a scared and weepy lay ? " " Except the gentleman rancher out of Single Tree . " Her face tightened and came up to meet his as if he might be the gentleman himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He gave her a fix against the most natural thing in the world , a forever fix . " Her eyes fell to the desk again , and she went on as if talking to herself . " The poor thing will never be any good , Mort , not just no good for a house but no good for cute man , no good for womanhood . It happens often , oftener than you 'll ever know . Frigidity , I mean . Why I do n't know , except in hex case I do . It 's sad . " Here she was , he could almost think , the enemy of wives and sweethearts , operator of a house of ill fame , pussy peddler , corrupter of men , and here she was bleeding for all the cold , somehow-castrated women who hated her because she suppliedwhat they would n't or could n't and anyhow did n't  --  the most natural thing in the world . Go a step farther , and ap64man might understand her interest in the girl , who had nothing to offer a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guilt through possession , maybe . Pity through guilt . A sort of Socialism except the property could n't be divided . What he said was , " But her coming here ? That does n't fig-ure . " " Oh , yes . She told herself she could do it . She vowed she would . She swore she must . " " The trail 's petered out . Why ? " Eva cleared her throat harshly , as if to allow no dispute of what was to follow . " For an education . " Any man would have to laugh , no matter Eva 's glare . " I be good goddammed , " he said , " if she did n't come to the right place ! " " Morton Ewing , " she answered  --  and her tone now might have meant pity for ignorance  --  " I 've told you her background . She was going to save every penny . " Before he could answer , she stood up and announced , " It 's time you met her . " For the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the noise sounding through from the parlor had increased . Someone was playing a rinky-dink tune on the piano , and deep and shrill voices rose in words and laughter , and over all came a rowdy bass that he recognized . " No fools , no fun , folks . Here 's to stud duty . " He turned to Eva , who stood at the side door . " Him ? " She nodded . " Sarge Kraker . Compliments of the house . " " Cheating jackass . " She said , " The law , " as if the two words were explanation enough , and before closing the door after herself added , " I have never let her appear in the parlor . " A quick one would n't hurt him , he reckoned , but it would n't do him any particular good . The hell with it . And the hell with Sheriff Harry Howie , that weak-gutted Republican whop65had named Kraker his deputy . Matter of simple appreciation , boys . Matter of recognition . Thanks for votes , of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world always had toadies , always had half-fearful , follow-theleaderbums whose votes were as good as any , if you please , fellow Americans . So compliments of the house . Free booze and bed with your badge . One of these days Sheriff Howie could expect another talking to . A quick one would n't hurt after all , being as he was about to be introduced to what was a virgin by rights . Here 's how , being as Eva would suck him into some deal if he did n't blow back . A damsel in distress , huh ? A candidate , maybe , for the pages of Sir Walter Scott ? More likely , almost surely , a draggle-tailed , bleating ewe lamb from the hospital band . Why wait , having heard enough ? Why wait when he ought to be on the way to the ranch ? He was standing by the table when Eva herded the ewe Iamb in . The lamb wore a simple blouse and skirt . When she turned to Eva , as if for direction or assurance , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together in back and tied with a ribbon . Leave it to Eva to outfit her for a part . Regardless , she was a small girl with the fresh , the pitiful curves of first womanhood ; and she looked at him out of wide , blue , fearful eyes set wide beneath a height of brow . In the silence that Eva let go on while he sized the girl up , he marked 1 be short upper lip , the rather wide mouth , the cheeks planing clown clean to the smooth round of chin . But the face did n't smile . It seemed beyond smiling . It flicked across his mind how they catalogued Thoroughbred foals in Kentucky : by sire , out of dam , by dam 's sire . She was by Illusion , out of Spring Day , by  --  by Disenchantment . Eva said , " Juliet , I want you to meet Mr. Mort Ewing . Mort , this is Juliet Justice . "  |p66He  answered , " Howdy , miss , " thinking that only a down-atheelseditor with Shakespeare and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The girl made the beginning of a curtsy . " How do you do , NIr . Ewing ? " She spoke in the lingering tones of childhood . " Mr. Ewing is one of our foremost citizens , " Eva told the girl . If there was a touch of mockery in the words , there was none in voice or manner . " He used to visit us rather often . Now it 's a special occasion . " She paused . " Julie , I 'm afraid you have n't met many good men . Mr. Ewing is a gentleman . " The girl 's face changed . There came on it the look of haunt and yet of submission . Her young voice got out , " If you want , Miss Eva  --  " Then , unaccountably , the blue eyes brightened . It took Ewing an instant to see it was tears that gave them a shine . It took him another to catch on . His voice came back to him loud . " Good Lord , child , no ! Eva , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Eva spoke softly . " Not again ever . I just wanted you to meet a friend you can count on . " A slick surround , Ewing thought , one he should have resented . Some kind of commitment , some sort of obligation he signed by silence while he looked at the girl . Damn Eva 's heart ! Eva went on , " You may go back to your room now . Side stairs and back . " " I know , " the girl said , and turned to Ewing . " Good night , Mr. Ewing . " Unexpectedly she offered her hand . It was a small , firm hand , and for a second it fitted in his with a seemingtrust that made him feel untrustworthy . Call it the devil 's tickle that he would play for even one flash with the thought of erasing that abused innocence . After the girl had gone , Eva said , " Well ? " " Well yourself . " " Sit down . Do n't you like her ? "  | " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my word . " She had put herself back in her chair , and now she put both elbows on the desk and rested her chin in her two fists . That position meant business . " You do n't know it yet , Mort , but you 're going to let her have a try at school . You 're going to put up the money . " " So now I know , " he said , and had to laugh . " Eva , you 're back to yourself . Except in books , it did n't go with the breed , that wholehearted act . But big-hearted at my expense ? Yep . " " You can afford it . " " If I want to . Do n't know as I do . By God , Eva , you salted the mine , putting her up in pigtails and little-girl gear . " The girl 's face showed behind the words , the girl 's justbloomedand violated body . There was her bloodline , not by Disenchantment but by Violation . " I dressed her right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not tight-ass , it do n't matter what you 've said . You know so . But crucified Jesus ! " She had begun by roasting him , thinking that way to make sure he was tender . She had basted him with some compliments , too . Then she 'd gentled the girl into the kettle . Some mulligan ! She asked , " You doubt my judgment ? " " Sure . Go to school ? Go to school where ? Could n't be here . " " Has to be , " she answered through a mouth tightened by the fists on her chin . " Where else is a friend ? " " She stays at a whorehouse and goes to high school ! Eva , you 're loco . " So she was . Loco and , to boot , out of character . By rights she was a hard-headed woman with an eye for a dollar . Let a girl cheat on her , and out she went . Let one get too old and too worn or too bottle-fed , and she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just a little something by way of good-bye . Let a seller , any kind , hike up his prices , and he sure God learned better . A keen businesswoman , that 's what she was . " Not that loco , " she said , and let the rest wait . A good businesswoman somehow gone soft , no matter if she did want him to put up the money . The ruler of the roost pulled from her perch , pulled by a sorry-faced child who had been forced to yield what the house sold . Right there might be an answer  --  the child . Supposing in Eva was an old wish for motherhood , say now for someone to mother . A mule , alwaysbarren by some act of God , always was trying to take charge of a colt . And a hot crotch cooling off with the years maybe could nurse regrets at the lack of results . Now her hands came from her chin . They were small hands , not overused , expressive as the wave of a wing . " Will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I been doing ? Crying an auction ? " " No one knows Julie , no one to speak of . " He had to put in , " Except you and me and your girls and the two sports she could n't sport with . " " Will you hush ? My girls never blab . They would n't want to and would n't dare to . The two sports were strangers , greenhornsbound over to Oregon . Here , come and gone . " One hand made its one wave . " Once she 's out of the house , I wo n't know Julie , not to anyone 's knowledge . " He could n't quite believe what he said , but some doubtmade him say it . " You just plain want to get rid of her . " " Have it your own goddam way ! Sure . She 's no use to me . " " Cool off , Eva . " She leaned back and folded her hands on the desk , and her face went from angry to grave . " Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being I 'm who I am . But about Julie , no one will know . " " It 's a cinch to get out . "  | " The two men are gone . The girls wo n't tell , and I wo n't tell , and you wo n't tell . She wo n't even know you 're paying the freight . " " Who will , to her thinking ? " " Fatty Adlam . I 've talked to Bertha . " " Bertha ? " " Mrs. Adlam . In secret . By night . In public we 're stran-gers . " He said , " I 'm a son of a bitch . " " Make it double if you ever tell . Not here , but once I knew her as one of the girls . There 's a fine woman , Mort , with a reliable husband and a nice child . Get that fool look off your face ! Cross off the good wives who used to be whores and cross off the good get that they got , and in the west @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know it damn well . " Part of it was true , but only a part . In her count Eva scanted the fillies who 'd come west to take jobs teaching school and wound up as wives . She scanted the remembered sweethearts that men had sent for or returned east to get once they had stake enough . In the silence between them the noise in the parlor beat at the door  --  the shrieks , the whoops , the pound of piano . " That free-pasture jackass brays loudest , " he said . Eva did n't answer . She might still be thinking about oncewhorewives and their proper manners and prime pups and the hauls between stage stops . He said for lack of something better , " I thought it was whiskey settled the west . " " Will you please swallow your head ? Fatty and Bertha will take Julie in . She 'll help around the house . Not enough , though , with school and her studies . The price is twenty dollars a month , out of which the Adlams , who can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will get bed , board , books and duds . There you are , Mort Ewing . "  | " There I 'm not . There 's school and how she gets in . You think Prof will take into high school someone never finished the grades ? You think he wo n't have to poke in her past ? " " That 's where you come in . You recommend her , telling the teacher about her life with her pa but docking off rape and the rest . You can fill in with some story about the time since he died . Long as you back her , the teacher wo n't poke . " " And she 'll come out at the head of her class , huh ? " " She 's smart . She 'll pass examinations , if any . Have your professor test her and see . After all , you 're on the school board . " " Not to sneak a poor whore into high school . And I was n't elected to fuddle the teacher . " " He does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It will come out . " He got up and poured her a drink and said , " Take this and come to your senses . " Look , Eva , " he went on as he sat down again . " Total it up . We do n't know that the girl has learning enough to enter high school . All right . All right . Maybe she has . I bid a pass there . Second , her past will catch up with her , sure as scours follow spring grass . Next , Collingsworth is not a man to play foxy with . " " I never knew you to be afraid of a man . " " Aw , bullshit . I respect him . I 'm leaning to like him , him and his family . " " It could n't be the money you 're thinking of ? " He had to grin . " Fair is fair . I fed you a cactus , and you feed me one back . Only yours has n't got any stickers on it . No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be damned if I take it on me to risk the new school and schoolmaster . They would both be deader than General Custer 's command if the girl was found out . " " You 're concerned just with yourself . " " Wrong . Happens I am thinking bigger than me . Col/lingsworth would have to be told . I do n't have to guess at his answer . " Both her hands waved out now , indicating , maybe , defeat . " I should have known . In some ways you 're such a moral bas-tard . " " Jesus do n't think so . " " All right , Mort . " The words came out on a sigh . " Will you talk to the professor then , plain as you care to ? Damn it , will you try ? " " Nope , " he said , and got up . " Nope . Thanks for the drinks . " She came from behind the desk and stood close to him , though not as if hoping to soften him by the offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trick would n't work , not now , not here , not even with the help of come-on perfume . Close as she was , somehow he did n't feel close to her but at a far remove from the flesh he had known . It was almost as if he never had bedded her and stood cut off from what he had done . Between them only the knowledge remained , and what the hell did it come to ? Old days , old ways ; and a man almost could smile at the eagerness of men and women , some women , to get their mucous membranes together . As he took a step around toward the door , she put a hand on his vest . " Please , Mort . " Then , " Socialist , it 's what you owe . " " Owe , hell ! " he said , and took hold of the door knob . ' Keep up the good work , Eva . " He clattered down the stairs , not caring whether the noise could be heard above the noises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his team . The horses had been too long without water . Mere Marsh ought to have a goddam water trough next to the hitch rail . As it was , he 'd have to angle off a couple of hundred yards to the goddam creek . Not until he was lined out on the road home did he takep72note of the moon riding quarter high in the eastern sky . Oncehe had thought of the moon as being wild and free and hopefulas a full pocket of gold . Once . Out of illusion . He hoped Marsh had remembered to include the thread in his order.  |p73AFTER  THE SERVICES Collingsworth took 1hand , shook hands with the preacher and st ing an unwelcome dissatisfaction with fur trine  --  which was all one could expect fn Harrison and the Methodist Episcopal Chr knew , closer to Unitarianism than any othe there he had reservations . The idea , refusing evil that flourished or lurked all about ! Cal of good ! Mary Jess , skipping along at his side , school we sang Jesus Loves Me . ' " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How many times had he been through it i houses in Indiana , in open-air and tent revi times had he listened to preachers who used of trade the fear of punishment and the None ever spoke of goodness for goodness ' prayers had he heard , uttered in the close e many hymns ? How many responsive readi readings the Reverend Mr. Harrison had go to the first chapter of John . The words sou : head , rolled out by the minister , murmuredp74In the beginning was the Word , and the Word was with God , and the Word was God . The same was in the beginning with God . All things were made by him ; and without him was not any thing made that hath been made . A wind from the southwest had sprung up , a dry wind that carried grit with it , and twigs and weeds gone to seed . Mary Jess turned away from it and walked backward and asked , " ' Will Mr. Ross be waiting for us , Father ? " " I think so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to church with us . " " She will when Tommie gets older . " So she would , but she had n't missed inspiration today . Mr. Harrison believed in the Bible . He believed its every word . It would have stunned him , no doubt , to learn that the King James Version was hardly contemporaneous with Jesus . He believed in a burning hell and a beatific heaven . He had fear of God 's wrath and faith in God 's mercy . He cried out for sinners , praying they would repent , not so much for the improvementof earth as the assurance of eventual bliss . And , Collingsworth suspected , he counted on God to fill his mouth when he took the pulpit without preparation . Well , at least God had filled it with evangelical resonance . As he turned the corner just west of the church , he saw the Ross buggy and team tied up at his side fence , the tails of the horses waved by the wind . " Mr. Ross does n't go to church ever , does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind was worrying her braids . She knuckled an eye that some speck had blown into . " I imagine , sometimes . Remember that he lives out in the country . " The reply seemed to satisfy her . He knew , though , that Jay never did . Oh , maybe for funerals and an occasional wedding.  |p75Probably  , in Memphis , Missouri , he had grown up as untrainedas a bramble . It was Jay 's loss , Collingsworth reflected . Preachers might be stupid , doctrine myopic and Methodist hymns flushed with militancy , but one reared in primitive ritual found in it something not only familiar but dear . Take " There Is Power in the Blood , " which the choir had rehearsed at Mr. Harrison'ssuggestion and sung today , aided , or rather , disconcerted , by a few uncertain voices in the congregation . The words and music stayed with him , stayed in the idle and echoing part of the brain so often dissociated from thought . " There is pow'r "  --  and then , with the high note held , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And , farther along , " In the blood "  --  and again the affirmation , " In the blood . " " The wind holds my breath , Father . " " Put your hand to your face , Mary Jess . It 's not far now . " The church house itself was n't bad , rustic in appearance , mostly shingled on the outside , but not bad . The inside was ample , for the perhaps fifteen to twenty adults and their broods who seemed to constitute the usual congregation . The dais provided room for the pulpit , an eight-member choir  --  though only four singers so far had volunteered  --  and a pump organ which Miss Eleanor Nagle , wispy as she was , played with great enthusiasm when the time was four-four. 13ack of the pews were two Sunday-school rooms which a rollingdoor closed off when need be . The choir was less than good , he thought as he turned his face from the wind . Worse than that : fierce . Old Mrs. Weaver , if ever she could sing , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Merc Marsh , liked to show off his wail of a tenor , which was often off key . It was good , then , to think of Miss Margaret Carson , whose voice was true and , in view of her size , surprisingly strong . He had been lucky to get , out ofp76Ohio , an assistant schoolteacher like her , lucky to find a religiousand seemingly resolute girl who could sing but , more than that , knew her language and history . At the preacher 's request he had stood again but reluctantly at the door to meet the worshipers as they came in . Already he had some acquaintance with nearly all of them . Yet nothingwould do but that Mr. Harrison introduce him as if he were some prize exhibit , by miracle just come to Arfive . " God bless you , sister . Bless you , brother , " he kept saying . " Have you met Brother Collingsworth ? Yes . Yes . All of us are , indeed , glad to meet him . " It had butted into his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the choir , that churchgoers too often reflected failure outside of the faith . It was as if God would make up for their shortcomings on earth once they passed into the Kingdom of Heaven . Here were old Mr. White , who did nothing , and his wife , who washed clothes and in repose shook a little as if her hands still labored the board . Here were Wilbur Webster , sometime bookkeeper , and Albert Garner , who could affix a notary 's seal . The hefty man was Gene Trescott , handyman . He appeared  --  that lurking and idle part of the brain always kept coming up with the inappropriate  --  uncomfortably flatulent . By contrast , almost sole contrast , there was old Mr. McLaine , who sat thoughtful , apparently reconciled to himself , his beard like a bit of summer cloud . That evidence to the contrary , successes had no need of salvation . But they did . If not of salvation then of grace . Fundamentalistor not , this church , this one church in town , was an influencefor good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selves but in the capability of the human being to reject evil and embrace good and create the society that Jesus spoke for . Whether they came to that faith through dogma or thought mattered little . How many had ever suffered through an over/exposure to doctrine ? Doctrine , though later to be examined , still gave right directions . Mary Jess stopped and lifted her face . One eye was crying from the speck the wind had blown in . He got out his handkerchief and pulled down her lower lid , found the speck and dipped it away . The hair under his hand , the whole shape of the skull , testified to things beyond knowledge , beyond feeling and thanks . After she had thanked him , she asked , " Will it blow all the way to Mr. Ross 's house ? " The sun focused on him from its mirror of sky , but gray wind clouds hung behind and over the Rockies , and a veil of mist was sweeping the face of Elephant Ear Butte . " I 'm afraid so , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " In time , dear . In time . " " I mean now . He could , could n't he , Father ? " " Oh , pshaw . You can stand a little wind . Let 's not ask tiny favors from God . " But there you had it , he thought . There was the contrast between fact and faith in a personal god . There was the chasm between broad belief and narrow , between the embrace of the universe and the catch-hold of  --  all right  --  superstition . And there , his hearers taken into account , was the reason the Bible class had been indifferent to the words spoken today . The members wanted the clean choice of bliss or brimstone . Answers they wanted , absolute answers to the unanswerable , for God was close and jealous , the god of Mr. Harrison : He had chosen Philippians for today 's lesson , not because the book was short or altogether because he had n't had time to organize a course , but because there were lines in it that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had to steady his voice.  |p78Finally  , brethren , whatsoever things are true , whatsoever things are honest , whatsoever things are just , whatsoever things are pure , whatsoever things are lovely , whatsoever things are of good report ; if there be any virtue , and if there be any praise , think on these things . The Lord knew he had thought on these things , had thought on them and lodged them in him , mind and heart ; and in the preparation of his lesson it had seemed to him not inappropriate , though not biblical , to quote enforcements recentby comparison . After reciting the passage from Scripture and commenting on it , he feared feebly now , he had said to the class , " Both inside and outside the Bible , unto even our own day , we find declarations in parallel to what you 've just heard . Mr. Emersonsaid  --  " The reference left everyone blank except for Mr. McLaine , who nodded his head and stroked his cloud of a beard . " Mr. Ralph Waldo Emerson , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us not much more than half a century ago , saying : " ' As when the summer comes from the south , the snowbanksmelt and the face of the earth becomes green before it , so shall the advancing spirit create its ornaments along its path , and carry with it the beauty it visits and the song which enchants it ; it shall draw beautiful faces , warm hearts , wise discourse , and heroic acts , around its way , until evil is no more seen . ' " At the path 's turning Mary Jess slipped her hand from his and ran for the front door , calling back , " Hurry up , Father . Get out of the wind . " Jay Ross drove a spirited buggy team of matched bays , which kept fighting the snug hold he kept on them . The per/haps not oversnug hold , May Collingsworth thought as surrey and team spanked through the town , drawing glances from here and there of what might be admiration or envy . Seated in back , with Mary Jess on one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other , she clasped both the rim of the basket and Mary Jess 's hand . It did not add to her ease when Jay turned his head around and , smiling while he held to his hat , said over Benton 's shoulder , " How 's your copperosity suggastuatin ' ? " He was always putting that question to Mary Jess . May said , " Sweetheart , do n't look at me . You know what Mr. Ross means . How are you ? " " Just fine , Mr. Ross , but I wish the wind would quit blowing . , Jay glanced ahead and turned back . " Lots of ways to look at it , Mary Jess . Do n't see any mosquitoes around , or horseflies , do you ? " " The wind blew them away ? " The words themselves , spoken in a child 's frail voice , might have been blown away , might now be whispers echoed afar . " Sure thing . " Mr. Ross  --  Jay , he wanted to be called  --  had heard after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover , one or the other . " " I wish I was a fly then . " Jay laughed his hoarse , wheezing laugh . Looking at his squat , bib mouthed face , May thought his would be the prize voice in a pond . But the notion , if not quite uncalled for , still was unfair , and she put it out of her mind . Benton tugged his hat snug and let his hand fall and , too late , grabbed for the brim again . The hat had sprung from his head and was flying off to the side . With an effort Jay pulled the team to a stop . He was grinning . Benton said , " Confoundit ! " As if haste were unfitting , he stepped to the ground.  |p80He  was , May knew , vexed with himself  --  which meant he was vexed with everything and everybody . The hat had lodged against a bush , invitingly . He marched to it , as if it were the offender , but , just as he thrust his hand out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And on . There was nothing else for it then . Benton ran . When he returned , breathless , he had the hat jammed so far down on his head it would be a wonder if it ever fit properlyagain . A new hat , too . Five dollars . He got back in his seat without speaking . " I 've lost mine a hundred times , I bet , " Jay said in easing tones . It was n't the first time he had surprised her . He put the horses to a trot . Benton answered , " So , " not as a question . " Just one of the little prices we pay , Prof. " " So ? " " Was n't for the wind , what would livestock do ? Go hungry , maybe starve , or have to be kept close and fed all the time . " Jay was speaking to all of them now . " Come winter , the wind clears most of the snow from the ranges . Lets stock get to the grass . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge seemed off his irritation . " That 's why this eastern slope is so good , because it 's windy . It 's a chinook blowing now , warm from down the mountains . Later on you 'll welcome it . " The ill wind that blew somebody good . But not now . Not her . Even hatpins , a veil and , last of all , a tied-over scarf were hardly enough a secure her own hat . The wind dusted her white gloves , which were a sight already . It parched and wrinkledthe skin , which she could feel drawing tight . It whipped grit in the mouth and grit in the eyes and kept flapping back the blanket meant to cover Tommie . Even the horses , manesp81and tails whipping like tattered pennants , stepped along with beads aslant . Indiana winds mostly murmured . They breathed mostly soft , through remembered oak and maple and sycamore and the great tulip tree that flowered in the back yard . They idled along , playful with leaf and with blade . So might this wind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it looked for . This country was too big for the heart , too vast ' ) contain , too wild for love , too empty for home . Where was the end of it ? What was the end ? The nausea she had thought over with made her swallow . Tommie began to fret . He was a little thing and frail for his age , little and frail for time and place , too ; but in a God forsakenland what did God care ? Feeling disloyal , she pushed back her depression . Here was Benton , and Benton rejoiced in his love for the country , forgiving  --  little thoughts helped  --  the snatch of his hat . If Montana suited him , so would it her . What he loved she would learn to love , too . Where he was , there she would be . World everlasting . Jay pulled up in front of his house and cramped a wheel for their exit . From somewhere a dog came barking a welcome , its tail wagging , its hair patterned like blown grass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had dismounted . He drove toward the barn . Mrs. Ross came to the door and , having opened it , shrank back . " Quick ! " she said . " Such weather ! " Once the weather was closed out , she welcomed them . " I can put Tommie down anywhere , " Benton said . He was carrying the baby , basket and all . Tommie had quit crying . It was as if all he had wanted was haven . Mrs. Ross extended her hands for the basket . " Please , " shep82said with what seemed more than manners in attitude and tone . " Let me put him down . " As she returned from the bedroom , Jay ushered in Mr. McLaineand Miss Carson . They had traveled together , it becameevident , in Mr. McLaine 's buggy . Both looked blown , even Miss Carson , whom one would almost have thought inviolable . The Ross girls , Jane and Beth , came downstairs then in a flutter of Sunday dress and greeted the company nicely . With Mary Jess on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasantries were exchanged in the parlor . Mr. McLaine she knew for a gentle and educated man , the only man in town with intellectual kinship to Benton . The Ross girls , both pretty , were to young to assess except to note that Jane was reserved and Beth bouncy . Miss Carson , unruffled and starched , might be superior to the world 's foibles . Loud though he was , or perhaps because he was , Jay seemed misplaced in this , his own home . It was as if , by talk and gesture , he would make room for himself in a circle he knew closed to him . Or that he defied the strange boundaries . He was a lusty heathen who had blundered into a meeting of the Ladies ' Industrial and sought to make the best of the circumstances . May thought him a little pathetic . She must remember to describe her impressions to Benton . But it was Mrs. Ross who drew first attention  --  the sad but eloquent eyes , the appearance of beleaguered gentility , the suggestion of fret almost despaired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrinkles . It occurred to May that each harsh breath of air might have left its little etching on her skin . To her , she supposed , Mrs. Ross always would be the woman of the wind . Mrs. Ross excused herself and went through the dining room to the kitchen , presently to come back and announce , " Dinner is ready . " She looked a little flushed from her chores in the kitchen , though , as May knew , she had a hired girl to help her , no doubt a raw one.  |p83The  table was set right . Against the fresh linen gleamed silverwareproperly placed . For a centerpiece someone had picked wildflowers  --  goldenrod and daisies and unknown fall blooms . At the head of the table were roast chicken and dressingand side dishes , each with its fresh-polished serving utensil . When they were seated , Jay said , " Well , folks  --  " but halted at his wife 's frown . " Oh , sure . What I mean is , will you please ask the blessing , Prof ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God bless the food to their use and them to His service . Mr. McLaine and Miss Carson echoed amen . Before starting serving , Jay unfolded his napkin and industriouslypolished his silverware , this time not catching Mrs. Ross 's expression . It was habit , May knew . She saw him in untidy restaurants and beside the greasy cook wagons she 'd heard of . Were bread on the table instead of hot rolls , he 'd probably butter a whole slice at one time . With the plates served and the side dishes passing , Jay asked , " What 's a feed minus the oysters ? Ham without eggs . " " I told you none were available . " There was a touch perhaps of asperity in Mrs. Ross 's reply . " It 's September , " Jay said . " R in it . " It was Mr. McLaine who broke whatever tension there was . " Interesting thing . In Montana and , I suppose , in neighboring interior states people crave seafood . We may find sometime that it provides an element @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surely no one can complain at this fare . " No one could . May had cut up the portion of chicken for Mary Jess and served her small helpings from the bowls that were passed . Now , as they ate and paused to make conversation , the spoken words drifted around her , hardly heard . She ought to pay more attention , ought to participate . But let the menp84talk . Benton and Mr. McLaine were playing around with the question of whether things not sensed in fact existed . To both of them the idea seemed interesting but empty . Did a mountaincome into existence only when seen ? Aw ! Jay had no time for such speculation , counting it a crazy waste . He said , " Tell me the soil and the climate , and I can say grass ' with my eyes closed , my nose plugged and me in a barrel . " Across the years she heard the repeated advice of old ProfessorElrod of Earlham College . " Never think small ! " He was a slight , gray man with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though Quakers did n't go for evangelism . " Do n't think small ! " She had been guilty , or almost , in her unspoken pickingat Jay . So what if he polished his silverware and called a feast a feed and would have buttered a whole slice of bread ? Did those things count in the last summing up ? He knew not what he did . Not that she herself would diminish or forsake the amenities . On going out , she would wear dress gloves always and , heaven knew , a hat , and not just for church . She would lay the table as it should be laid , even for the family alone . It would be nice , for company , to have sterling instead of commonplate . For Benton 's and the children 's sakes as well as her own , she would watch her grammar , which needed small watching , and forego slang if only because it smacked of vulgarity . But the proprieties could be carried to the point of absurdity . For instance , this matter of engraved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ departing ladies left on little silver trays provided for them . The practice suggested that the lady of the house had no memory for names but surely could read and recall . It made insistence on some other conventions seem a bit silly  --  to one who had no engraved cards . Jay asked , " Now just what are you grinning about , Mrs. Collingsworth ? "  | " Oh , oh , nothing , " she said . He kept his bold eyes on her . " Excuse me . For a minute I was far away . " Feeling somewhat mischievous , she added , " A thought was calling on me . " " Hmm . Nice visit , seems like . " Jay dismissed the subject with that . When all had eaten to surfeit , Jay pushed his chair back . " I guess the ladies will excuse us , " he said . In the parlor Collingsworth took the cigar that Jay offered , thinking something could be said for a luxury he could n't afford . Mr. McLaine took one , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hearing the comforting sounds that women made in tidying up after a meal . A back door opened and closed , probably after someone on the way to the privy . Despite all niceties the natural functions had a way of announcing themselves . It must have been embarrassing , for women especially , on the Oregon Trail without even an outhousein hundreds of miles . As if just to make conversation Jay said from the comfort of his leather-lined chair , " ' Bout time for school , Prof. " " Tuesday morning . There 'll be a class of eighteen or so , maybe half from the country . " Mr. McLaine tipped a little ash from his cigar . " You have had time to form some perhaps lasting impressions , about Montana , I mean ? " " It is hardly what I expected . " Jay asked , " No ? " " It is better than that . Written accounts had led me to believemen in town would be wearing guns , whereas they 're not . There are Indians , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sorry lot , " Jay put in . " But from what I 've seen I 'd say the magazines and newspapersback east were wrong  --  anyhow exaggerated  --  in other directions . "  | " What ? " " For instance , about the copper wars . About William A. Clark and Marcus Daly and Heinze and all the rest . AboutI vote buying and bribery and general moral delinquency . " " Aw , that 's Butte 's business and Helena 's . Hardly touched us . Never has . " Mr. McLaine leaned forward and gestured mildly with his cigar . " Not all the truth , jay . Editors and newspapers were bought this side of the mountains , not to mention our honorablelawmakers . And it nauseates me to think how the copper trust brought the state to its knees , forcing the governor to call a special session of the legislature and the session to enact the special legislation the trust demanded . What a disgrace ! " " I 'm not about to puke , " Jay answered . " Sure , to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hungry men back on the payroll , we gave the trust what it wanted . But what went beforethe trust , before Daly and Heinze and Clark sold out , why , that was just one big poker game . Bet , call and bluff . The best bluffer won , or the high hand . " " Or the most money . The most money generally wins , I Jay . " To Collingsworth Mr. McLaine 's measured words seemed to have a hidden significance . " The big bankroll has a way of adding to itself . " " Losers weepers , " Jay answered . Whatever point Mr. McLainehad tried to make had failed of its purpose . Softly he added , " Winners keepers . " It could have been by common consent that they changed the subject . After a while , after the cigars had been smoked down to stubs , the women came in with Mary Jess tagging along ; and presently Collingsworth suggested it was time to start home . " I have to milk that good cow , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " May came immediately to her feet and , after good-byes andp87thanks , Jay rolled them toward town . The wind had blown itself out , had hurried on from nowhere to nowhere . The leaves on the clumps of willows they passed were as still as paintings , and a lone cottonwood stood as if it had never known fury . Here , now , as happened so often when the sun notched itself in the mountains , was the hour of no wind . Some words of Saint John , written far back in his memory , came to mind . " The wind bloweth where it listeth , and thou licarest the sound thereof , but canst not tell whence it cometli , and whither it goeth . . . " Had John never known the quiet time , when earth and air were at peace , and the creatures thereof ? After a long silence Jay said , " That looks like Mort Ewing 's saddle horse in front of your place . Yep . There 's Ewing himself on the yon side . "  |p88COLLINGSWORTH  HAD LISTENED @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had known for some time what the answer must be . It was difficult , however , to pay whole attention to a matter already settled ; and , as Ewing tried to tie up whatever loose ends he 'd left , he kept finding a part of his own mind wandering off . He had to call this his office , this mere corner of Woodmen'sHall closed off from the rest by movable screens . Unseenbeyond it were ranged student desks , which for Saturdaynightdances would be moved to the sides to provide room for cavorters and seats for occasional sitters , wallflowers and drunks . But now , on this last day before school , the hall was empty and met well enough Ewing 's insistence on privacy . Ewing , he reflected as Ewing 's useless words continued and stopped and continued against his own silence , must have regardedthis arranged interview as an occasion , one so special as to call for a complete suit and tie , though his cowpuncher boots were out of keeping . Even his talk was dressed up , free of range-country habit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had started his story on the flat , as if to lay the whole case bare and leave it to cold judgment , his voice as he proceeded had gained warmth and strength . Itp89was the conviction , Collingsworth thought , of a man who had convinced himself , not by the facts but by his own recital . " That 's the whole of it , and that 's the truth of it . I am willingto swear by that , " Ewing said . His eyes were questioning . " On what authority ? " " My own eyes and ears . " " And you can swear that you saw and heard all of it ? " Ewing shifted in his chair and brought a hand out , one fingerpointing for emphasis . " Prof , you can have your own ideas of Eva Fox , and I wo n't argue too much . But whateverEva is , she 's not a liar . And remember , I saw the girl . " " She now stays at the home of a saloonkeeper . " " She is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where she helps with the housework , for pay enough to see her through school . " " Mort , there 's just one answer . You surely realized it before you began . " " I know your answer now . I knew it before , if I read your face right . " " You read it right . " Ewing sighed and sank back . " Not that I want to , but what would you think of taking the case before the whole board ? " " No ! Confound it , no ! This is an administrative matter , not one of policy . If the board voted unanimously to let the girl in , I 'd say no if it cost me my job . " Ewing said , " Good man , " and no more . " If I admitted this , this girl  --  what 's her name , Juliet Justice ?  --  and her past became common knowledge , the school would be dead . " " Ilurt , maybe . But it is n't the school that 's the first thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give you credit , it is n't your future here . "  | " What is it , then ? " " It 's your feeling for what 's proper . It 's your sense of mo-Tality . " " Tell rue , what 's wrong with that ? " " No use my saying , but it can eat a man up . " Out of respect for Ewing , Collingsworth considered the words , though in application to him they seemed idle . Simple decency did n't eat any man up : it kept him whole . By being whole , by acting whole , he helped repair his community . He set standards . Still ? For an unwelcome instant , for no relevantreason , there came to his mind 's eye one John ' Wesley Harrison , a whole man and a fool . He said , " Has it occurred to you , Mort , that the girl might revert to her old ways ? " The words were no sooner out than he wished he could swallow them . Ewing shuddered his chair back and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place in his suit , too big for the shoulders , too untamed for a tie , too natural a man for a townsman 's disguise . He said , " Good crucified Jesus ! " and stood there towering . For the first time it occurred to Collingsworth , without fazing him , that Ewing could be dangerous . He had never feared any man . But from Ewing came a special and inner force that battered him , as some of his statements had batteredhim earlier . It was the emanation of a man who was a man , whole or not , and it was unwelcome . Ewing was going on . " Old ways , for God sake ! Have n't you listened ? To your notion have I been lying ? Whoring is n't her old way . Not new either . What she 's trying to do is get back to herself . " Collingsworth held up his hand , but Ewing ignored it . " You think you 're going to have a bunch of goddam , simonpurevirgins in your school ? You going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , them that ai n't heard it already ? Crucified Jesus ! " Collingsworth stood up . " I 've heard enough . What seems right to me , that will I do . " " All right . Then will you see the girl ? Will you test her for what she 's learnt ? " " No . " Ewing swung about and pushed a screen aside , pausing just long enough to fling out , " A religion that do n't have room for redemption or some such is a closed-in shit house . " Of a sudden , hearing his boots march him down the hall toward the entryway , Collingsworth found the answer . He had been a fool not to see it before . He hurried past the opened screen and called , " Mort , " and saw Ewing turn at the door . " On second thought I 'll see the girl . I 'll test her for en-trance . " Ewing gave an abrupt nod and disappeared . One Juliet Justice would be given her test all right , all right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bentonwould tell of his troubles . It was often if not always this way , the physical urgency in him demanding discharge before he could be the kind and thoughtful and confiding partner that was the true man . She disliked to think of the days ahead when , for the sake of her unborn , she would have to refuse him . He had come home straight-mouthed and short-spoken this Afternoon and at supper had distressed Mary Jess by saying iu his hard voice , " Ca n't you watch what you 're doing ! " when she had spilled her milk . It was a time , then , for silence . No use to ask him what was the matter . It had to lie in him like indigestion.  |p92Now  , with the act of love done , he would talk . But sometimes it seemed not so much the act of love as a fierce drive for relief that allowed no time for approaches , for the preliminaries she would have welcomed . No matter . He was Benton and , the deed done , the need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand up and soothed his brow and said , " Benton . " He told her then , gently , about Mort Ewing and his plea for a girl who had been abused and later retreated , or sought to retreat , to a fancy house with the aim of making money for school  --  all this , mind you , according to Mort , who might not know the full facts himself . No doubt he did n't . It exceededthe imagination to believe that here was the whole and true story . Prostitution for education indeed ! " But , Maysie , " he went on , " even supposing there 's nothinghidden from Mort and nothing from me by Mort , what then ? Let the report be true , let the girl be all she 's made out to be , I ca n't gamble the good name of the school . Under the best of circumstances she 's got to be a casualty . " " The poor thing , " May said . " I can sympathize . I can un-derstand . " He chuckled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , huh ? Not much , I 'll warrant . How can you understand , you , the innocent ? " " No woman is innocent , Benton . Women are born not innocent , most of them anyway . We know but keep still . " She could almost hear him fumbling the words in his mind and had to smile to herself . " You tend to think , Benton , that we have no understanding beyond our experience . No imagination , no sympathy outside personal occurrences . " " I did n't say that , sweetheart . " " But it 's true . Limitations do n't ensure innocence in women , you innocent yourself . " She gave him a small nudge . " Men just like to think they do . " Here was an interestingp93line of thought , not altogether new but never before expressed , but it was off the subject , and she decided not to pursueit save for a conclusion she thought afterward was rather smug . " So men make the rules harsh : women make them tolerable . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was amused . " Is class dis-missed ? " " Except that I sympathize with that girl . I understand . " " Forget it , Maysie . I have n't told you , but there 's a sure way out " " Yes ? " " I 'm going to see the girl . I 'm going to give her a test , you bet , a test that even a college graduate would fail . Then , phhft ! " The words brought her up in bed . " Benton Collingsworth , cut 'll do no such thing ! You must n't . You ca n't . I refuse to believe it 's in you to do so . You 'd be false to her and false to Mort and false to yourself . " She added as an incidental , " I just hope you and Mort can patch things up . " All he answered was , " I 'll see . " First day of school over , students gone home or wherever . The opening had gone well enough , Collingsworth thought . Young people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anarchy . Not that some of the ranch boys , several of whom were domiciled in town with family friends , had n't worked , during calving and lambing and hayingand such , but even they stood in need of severity if they were to learn . He had given an object lesson to all by ejecting one unruly lout pending the time he could mind his mannners . Respect for authority came first , then , it was to be hoped , admiration . Thank the Lord , that small Miss Carsoncommanded attention . A well-known and frequent fault ofp94women teachers was that they could n't enforce discipline . Miss Carson was a notable exception . He was beginning to think of her as a little Napoleon . He sat waiting . One of the screens of his office was halffoldedto allow entrance . He snapped his pocket watch open . It was time , or almost , she arrived . Best not have it appear , though , that she alone kept him after hours . He shuffled the students ' personal-history cards on his desk and gave them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounded on the screen 's upright . He looked up and asked , " Yes ? " The girl seemed to shrink from his gaze . " I  --  I am Juliet Justice . " " Come in and be seated . " He had thought not to get up but did so . Habit , he told himself . " I was informed you would be coming . " However misguided in other directions , Mort Ewing was right in his surface impressions . The girl was dressed properly in a blue blouse and pleated skirt , obviously freshly ironed . She wore no rouge , though he had wondered if she might not . Her hair was parted in the middle and drawn back severely , by braids , he supposed . He could n't see from in front . For an instant , after she had seated herself with what a man would have to call prim grace , he continued to appraise her . Her forehead was high . It held room for brains . He wondered if she had a back to her skull . Phrenology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the intellectualcapacities of people whose heads in the rear were flat with the spine . Surprisingly , her face with its blue eyes and lean planes was delicate . It would have softened the judgment of many a man . " You want to go to school ? " he said to the waiting eyes . She answered , " I 'm going to , somewhere . " It was a declaration , a statement of purpose , a vow muted but taken.  | " That 's to be seen , " he said . " There has to be preparation for high school . " She did n't reply . She just sat , her young face waiting . It was , he saw now , the face of fear , the pleading and piteous face of a fear perhaps stamped there , as Ewing had said , by the outrages of men . Men were damned brutes , or could be . Even now another man might be thinking of the budded breasts , of the sleek treasure of thighs , of the young mouth crying while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ell , if it burned anywhere , had special fires waiting. 1 le said , " How old are you ? " " Sixteen next month . " " And where have you gone to school , to grade school , that is ? " " IIere and there , sir , and never for very long . My daddy was my real teacher . " She paused and added with a gravity that outlawed ridicule if not doubt , " Please , sir , he was a learned man . " " Yes , of course . " At this point it was all right to sound dry . Before he found more words , the girl said , " The bottle got him . I tried my best , sir , but booze killed my daddy . It was a bad thing . " " It always is , " he answered , feeling weakened by her candor , by her young fellowship in the recognition of evil . He would have to admit her , for a trial anyhow . That decision had been forced on him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's . May seldom disagreed with him but had an annoyinghabit of being right when she did . Infernally right . Still  --  - confound it !  --  a weak sympathy was a poor assessor of merit , else idiots would inhabit the classroom . More than t ! gat , this girl must not think that a pretty face and a fearful mien alone got her in . " All right , " he said . " Nothing so far necessarily rules you oil ! . Now , then , you have permanent quarters ? "  | " Yes , sir . With Mr. and Mrs. Adlam . I help Mrs. Adlam , and I like it there . " " Whereas , if I understand rightly , you did n't like it before ? " Even as he spoke , he knew the inquiry , though more or less veiled , had the whiff of prurience in it . But the question was asked and had to lie there . The girl 's eyes looked naked into his , and a mist came over them , and a spasm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that hers might be the face of Mary Jess later if the fates had their frolic with her ; and lines of remembered verse posted themselves in his head , lines about another prostitute , dead : Take her up tenderly , Lift her with care ; Fashioned so slenderly , Young , and so fair ! " Forget it ! " his voice came to his ears in a bark . " Forget it ! " The mist had grown into unheeded tears . The broken mouth said , " Daddy said , no matter what  --  " " I know . An education . Now I said forget it . " She took a handkerchief from her sleeve and wiped her face , and he waited for her composure , wanting crazily to reach over and take her hand . She rose and took a step away , her expression too tight and too old for her years . " All right , sir . Good-bye . " " Wait ! I did n't mean that . You are admitted . " The words had come out in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ? Oh , am I ? " If Mr. John Wesley Harrison thought the saved sinner wore the look of seen splendor , he should see this girl . " Report in the morning . "  |p97She  moved one pace toward him , as if to shake his hand , then turned and made off , her head lifted to unveiled Olympus . So much for that . So much , now , for that . He should have posed a few simple questions , at least , to test her knowledge of grammar , arithmetic , history , as he had planned . Instead , he had let the flush of unworthiness dictate his decision . It was n't the Lord who worked in mysterious ways : it was the dcvil . Still , it occurred to him as he got up to leave , he felt strangely good.  |p98SATURDAYS  WERE good days , and today would have been a good day in any case . Mid-September had been squally , and betweenwind squalls six inches of wet snow had fallen , leading a man to wonder why the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should bring unsettled weather . Then , like an apology for breach of truce , had come the chinook , warm as a sighing breath , and water had run in the paths that did for sidewalks and over the planks at the intersections ; and who , wanting to hurrah , cared much about mud ? Housewives . One indulgent housewife smiling while she plied broom or mop . Now , in early October , the paths were dry , the sky smiling , and Collingsworth , walking to the drugstore and post office , went along slowly . Why rush when the air was tonic and fallen leaves whispered under his feet ? There was green in the cottonwoods yet , along with new-come gold , and now and then , at no urging of breeze , a leaf fluttered down , somehow both melancholy and gay in its good-bye to season . The high lifts of the mountains to westward wore a mantle of snow above the stone blue of their bases . On the slopes of the benches to eastward grass had cured on the stem . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen at Mere Marsh 's store.  |p99More  than anything else , though , it was the size of this world , the generosity of it , that won a man over , that made him want no other . Depth of sky , reach of miles , elbow room for mind and muscle . Here was a country to live in . All right . Be sensuous : it was a land a man wanted to wake up with . Wanting that much , he wanted to know more about it . What was loved had its warm antecedents , warmer here , if imperfectly sensed because history whispered to ears that were open . It spoke in a couple of arrowheads he had found while out hunting . It murmured in the just-dead brain of an empty buffalo skull he had kicked up in a wallow used not so long ago . Only two lifetimes took a man back to Lewis and Clark , who had looked on this land and , despite all , had found it teeming and fair . Almost just yesterday the fur huntershad roamed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white man before them had set theirs . Then had come the buffalo hunters and wolfers , some of whom still lived , and t lien in due course the cowpunchers whose hi-yis , even now , were joining the reverberations of history . He was n't sure how much this train of thought had been directed by the sight of old Charlie Blackman , who was shuffling around in front of his shack . The shack was part tin and part scrap wood , and around it were angled or strewn other pieces of board and other rustings of tin that might come in handy someday , together with used remnants of leather and rope , a sagging grindstone and beaver and muskrattraps partly repaired , for when Charlie was not making do by swamping saloons he earned a few nickels by trapping . tit . Louis , he had said , was still the best market for furs . Collingsworth called out , " How are you , Charlie ? " Charlie came forward . He was whiskered and dirty . His gums worked on a chew Despitep100his age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure purpose , Collingsworth had observed . For the most part , however , he shuffled . Indifferent to the man , indifferent to the past of which they were beneficiaries , alive only to his age and outworn occupation , people were inclined to smile when his name was mentioned . " Har you ? " the old man said . " Dogged if you do n't always sing out hello . " " Fine . " Collingsworth gestured toward the traps . " Going out for beaver . " " Or muskrat or mink . Whatever fur comes to the bait . Wo n't be much . Not anymore . " " Not like old times , I suppose . " Charlie spit and looked into distance , and the shimmer of remembrance shown in his eyes . " I can call to mind , " he said , and let his subject trail off . " Yes ? " " Course , I was n't around when doin 's was real high , not for beaver . But buffalo , man alive , and wolfin ' along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where we 're standin ' and wolves taggin ' the cripples . Man alive . " Charlie dug his chew out with a forefinger , studied it and , apparently deciding it was dead as old times , dropped it at his feet . " In them days , " he went on , " the Injuns was smart , the women leastwise . Ai n't anything like it used to be . " " I suppose not , but cheer up , Charlie . This is still a young land . " Charlie 's remembering eyes came to focus in what might have been pity . " Young ? To you , I 'm thinkin ' . Whatever is old to the young ? Tell me that . Nothin ' , that 's what , except old men like yours truly . " A young country grown old through aging vision , Collingsworthreflected as he walked on . The eye of the beholder . But not entirely . Things had changed since Charlie 's youthp101and would change still more , not the mountains , not the sky , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeking homesites . The straggling forerunners , indeed , were already coming , bringing plows and grains and garden stuff and hope and the seed of their loins . When there were enough of them , what would be left ? What of the old times of uncluttered acres , of hope that no homesteader could hope for , of blithe and unstudied assurance ? Would the likes of Jay Ross and Mort Ewing disappear , their deeds unknown , their voices unheard , their philosophies outgrown and uncomprehendedby a new manner of men ? What of the free-andeasyattitudes for which , for all their flagrancies , something could be said ? Here , as schoolteacher and even as churchman , he felt a touch of discomfort , for he was part as well as agent of change . To his inner ear came the words of old Mr. McLaine , said after dinner one night  --  words emptied of pomposityby reason of person and content . " Change is the order of nature , " he had said . His beard swung to the shake of his head . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . What comes comes , to our dismayor delight or more likely both , and both diminished . " So be it . Change . Push , man . Sing hello and sigh goodbye . As he approached the Adlams ' white frame house , he caught a glimpse of Juliet Justice in the back yard . She was raking leaves . There was grace about her , a fluid economy of movement that would have caught any eye . Far more important , there was discipline . Here was a task to do , there in school a lesson to be learned , and there the tease of an idea to which she rose  --  well , like a trout to a skittering fly . Best student of all , he was about to admit . She wore a red scarf and did n't look up from her raking . It would be ques-I minable for him to call out a greeting.  |p102But  there was one change to rejoice in . Whatever his doubts had been , however insufficient and tainted his test of her , she was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serene had to wait further assay . Sauntering on through the rustling leaves , he wished all the students were as eager , as perceptive , as Juliet . Only three , maybe four , were close , including , thank heavens , Jay Ross 's girl Jane . Still , he had no complaint . By George , the school was doing well . For the most part these cow-country boys and girls were receptive . By cuffing one , he had cowed the three young ruffians who had thought to play hob with system . He would cuff the others if need be . He had order in his school , and respect for authority and even a liking of regimen and perhaps even a distant liking of him . The students might like Miss Carson as much or more . Certainly those youngsters who wanted to learn must . One thing for sure , they all respected her . Once he turned to the boardwalk of the main street , Collingsworthquickened his pace . Always he felt not timid but ill at ease , like a man in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boozy inquiry of the Family Liquor Store and the Arfive saloon . A piece of foolishness , of course . A dodge away from conviction and manhood . He slowed back to his saunter . The mail might not even have arrived yet . The stage was uncertainsince Mort Ewing had disposed of his contract . Ewing did n't call around at the house anymore . At the last school-board meeting he had been pleasant enough but aloof . It was as if their one quarrel had put a lasting distance between them . Yet Juliet was in school , was n't she ? She was recognized as a superior student . Here together were concessionand apology , if unspoken , and neither nor both dented Mort Ewing 's shell . Yet he must have known of the high reportsthe girl won . He would have heard of them from the Adlams , who surely knew . Or from the girl herself . Twice ,  |p103with  his own eyes , he had seen the two together in outside conversation . Twice . All right , he supposed . All right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! It was when he was almost in front of the Arfive saloon that a man with a star on his chest swung out the door . Krakcr . That was his name . Kraker , deputy sheriff . After him came two others , by appearances sometime cowpunchers , gone-to-seed rowdies . Kraker said , " Afternoon , Professor . " " Good afternoon . " Kraker slanted over and blocked the way while the two men looked on . His mouth smiled , and his breath stank of drink . With what might have been mocking assurance , he moved his arms to akimbo , one hand close to the revolver he sported. " flow you findin ' things here ? " " First rate . " " Guessed you would . " The man 's left hand came out open as if in acknowledgment of things men held in common . " Who would n't , with all them cuties ? " " What are you saying ? " " Oh , nothin ' , Professor . But it sure is nice to have a filly that needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and swung . Kraker went clown . He lifted himself with an elbow . At his hip a hand fumbled . Collingsworth kicked it away . With it went the revolver . It skated off the boardwalk . Kraker was licking the blood from his mouth . Collingsworth went on . There was the mail to get.  |p104MORT  EWING WAS coming from the barn when Fatty Adlam drove up . Damn shame , he was thinking , to have a good saddlehorse foundered and ruined forever , all because someone had neglected to close the door to the feed shed . The dog by his side wagged cheerful agreement , then ran out to bark . The sight of Adlam in a buggy , holding in either hand the reins to a livery-barn team , submerged his annoyance . A chicken , dusting in a patch of sand and sun , cackled out of his way . " Ca n't be . Not you , Fatty , " he said . " Special occasion ? " Adlam drew a breath into his big belly . " Special but bad . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleaned up on Kraker . " " And you call that bad ? " " The worthless son of a bitch . Kraker , I mean . " Ewing rested one arm on the rump of the nigh horse . " I vote aye . " " Mort , there 's one thing I guess you have guessed  --  which is that I know . But nobody ever heard it from me . " The fat face above Ewing wore the look of distress . The mouth was as apologetic as a bullet hole . " My hunch . Little Julie . "  |p105Ewing  said a slow , " So , " for no yet defined reason feeling Ilse blood rise . " Spill it all . " " It happened in front of my place , but it 's hearsay I go by . Kraker , tailed by a couple of no-goods , slaunched out and ( braced the professor . He said a word or two , and then he was on his ass . The professor booted his six-gun away . " " Any mention of the girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kraker was hinting around at all , and I guess especially one , of the schoolgirls . Made out the professorto be a lucky stud . " " Then somebody in the know told him . " " Sure . But who I 'm thinking about is the professor . " " What ! Oh , I see . He ought to be decorated . " " Yes , but the way it is , Mort  --  and that 's why I came  --  lie 's apt to wind up in court . " " For what ? " " Assault . Resisting the law . ' Whatever . It all could come out . " " Hank Howie , that pus-gut of a sheriff ! " Ewing removed his arm from the horse and stepped back . His dog brushed against him and licked at his hand . A couple of chickens I railed by , cheered by the prospect of feed time and roost . Out of sight a hired hand was pounding , putting in shape a piece of equipment for now or next season . " Anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not as if to defend Howie . " Then , under the law , right or wrong , the sheriff has to act . " " Thanks , " Ewing answered , and smacked the dog away . " Since when does a ruckus go on to court ? " " But it was the law he whopped . " " Yeah . Bad as pissin ' on Old Glory . " Ewing motioned toward the kitchen door . " Light , Fatty , and tie up . Then go insideand rest yourself . There 's a drink or so in the cupboard . "  | " What do you figure to do ? " " Stop it . Stop it before it goes any farther . " " You can , if anybody . " Adlam sighed , then took a quick breath . " But see here , Mort . " " What ? " " There 's a story I heard about you . You in action . " " That was away back . " To dismiss Adlam 's worry , Ewing smiled . " What I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if his weight were more float than burden , Adlam got down from the buggy and tied the team to the fence . For an instant Ewing watched him on his voyage to the kitchen door , then strode to the corral and saddled the one horse insideit . He put the horse to a steady lope , counting hill and gully as measures of progress . He could stop the sheriff if he got there in time , but damn Howie , damn Kraker , and damn the good people if ever they heard . It was dusk when he pulled up at the sheriff 's office . It was a stone building and served as jail , too , and had bars across the windows in back . He swung off the horse , threw the reins over the hitching post and went in . Howie 's eyes rose from his desk . Under his hand was some kind of paper . He had the look on his face of what passed for thought . " Have a chair , " he said . " Glad to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to light a lamp . In its yellow glow his eyes might have been oiled . He hitched in his chair and pulled at the belt that was always working down the slope of his belly . It struck Ewing that there were two kinds of fat , one unclean . " Little action in town today , " Howie said . " So I 've heard . " " I 've been debating , Mort . It 's a problem I got , but only one answer to it . " The face asked for sympathy . " I guess you know that damn teacher of yours hung a haymaker on Kraker.  |p107Disarmed  him to boot . What maybe you do n't know is that Kraker 's faunchin ' to swear to a charge . " " Why not let him faunch ? " " Because he 's got cause . Assault and battery on an officer of the law . Mort , how you going to abide that ? Where 's your respect if you do ? A sheriff 's got his duties , you know . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Use it , and you wo n't cite Collingsworth . " A shadow , maybe of irritation , crossed Howie 's face and left it bland . He picked up a gnawed piece of cigar and lit it by means of the lamp . " Sure , you got the school to considerand all , but I got the law and respect for it and a man hot to use it like it was intended . " He looked to Ewing for an answer and , getting none , went on . " I have n't seen you and Collingsworth hobnobbin ' much lately . " " Makes no difference . " " No ? Then what 's eatin ' you , Mort ? " Ewing waved the question away , but it had been a good one . School was eating on him , and Collingsworth , the proper bastard , and , damn it , the girl . Three times he had talked to her , three times since school started , and each time , like the old fool that he was , he had thought of young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the edge of his desk and spit out a shred of tobacco that clung to his lip . " You being a good Republican , you got to remember that Kraker swings quite a few votes . " He spread his arms out like some hill preacher bringing in the sheaves . Then one hand went to his chest , and a finger touched the star there . " Was n't for him , I might not be wearing this . It was that close . " " Pass that for now . Just tell me what made Collingsworth mad ? What did Kraker say ? " Howie 's eyes slid away . " Aw , nothin ' as I know of , Mort . Just some little josh of a thing . "  |p108Maybe  . Probably not . But Kraker could have lied in reporting to Howie . Time would tell . Ewing leaned forward and pointed a finger . " Now about Kraker swinging votes . " " He did ! " " Uh-huh , but are n't you forgetting something ? " Howie 's gaze asked what . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote of the county convention . " It took Howie an instant or two to understand . Then he said with a throw of his open hand , " Mort , you would n't ! " " The next convention might . It might figure it could put on the ballot a stronger candidate for the office . How many votes could Kraker turn for you then ? " As if that one little outburst was all a good politician could allow himself , Howie shook his head in unbelief . " By God , Ewing , I thought you were my friend . You mean , come conventiontime , you 'd fight my renomination ? " " It 's a little something to think about , but we have n't come to that point . " As he finished speaking , the knob turned , the door opened , and Kraker came in . He wore a patch over the side of his mouth . Ewing pointed to a chair . " Sit down , Kraker . " Taking his time , Kraker slouched over and sat . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its jut of a chin were sullen . About him was not so much an air of defeat as defiance . Ewing guessed that at least some of his scrubby followers had deserted his line and made bold to rag him , Fallen , the mighty always were sore . Here was no Sheriff Howie , to be reminded of the facts of political life . Here was a sulky four-flusher , a man to be buffaloed as he liked to buffalo others . It would be easy enough , too easy for a man 's taste . Ewing said , " You been shooting off your face and so got it closed for you . "  | " Be smart-ass . I do n't have to answer to you . " " I 'm thinking you do or you will . " Ewing kept his voice down . " Keepin ' quiet wo n't set well . " Kraker 's eyes went to Howie . " You goin ' to let him bullyragme ? " Howie answered mildly , " Best speak up , Sarge . " " Boss 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without them he would have kept still . " What the hell you want to know , Ewing ? " " What you said to Collingsworth . " " Nothin ' to speak of . It was horseplay is all . " " Do n't bullshit me ! " " Ask anybody . " Howie broke in . " Answer up , Sarge . " " Boss 's orders again . You want the truth , that 's what you 'll get . " " Get to Collingsworth . " " What I did was I just kind of shied a word at him about a girl , a girl I know about , one of Eva Fox 's once . And by God if she ai n't in school now ! " " Where 'd you hear so much ? " " Eva Fox , she fired Adelaide and  --  " " Eva did ? " " She did , and damn if that was n't dirty after Adelaide workin ' her ass there for two-three years . " " Skip your opinion . Go on . " " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few drinks , and she spilled it . You doubt me , I can name you this chippie . She 's  --  " " No goddam names ! " Howie interrupted . " All right . All right . We hear you , Mort . " " So who all have you blabbed to ? " Ewing said . " I ai n't . That 's who. "  | " How come that ? " " A smart man keeps his powder dry . " Ewing turned . " You believe him , Howie ? " " Sarge do n't lie to me . " The question would have to rest there , Ewing decided . There was a chance , fat or slim , that the thought of riper occasions  --  say campaign time  --  had kept Kraker mum , some or mostly . But something did n't jibe . " What about court , then ? Likely it all would come out . " Howie cut in with , " No court . No charge . Hear that , Sarge ? " " I figured so , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be , Ewing thought , that he had figured out for himself that running to court would only cost him more rank . " That 's sensible , " Howie said . " But damn him , I 'll get even ! " It was hurt speaking . It was the blister , the fester , of comedown . " No , Sarge . Easy , now , " Howie replied as if understanding the blister . " Tell you what . Tell your friends it ai n't the function of law to bruise up the voters . Tell ' em that 's orders from me  --  and what could and what can you do long as you 're deputy ? " Kraker thought about it . " One thing more , " Ewing said . " That 's to shut up . No leaks anywhere . Not even a whisper . Not from us . Not about Collingsworth or the girl or whatever . " Kraker had spirit enough to ask , " Orders ? " " Call it advice . Not everybody knows it , but it could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you been sponging pussy and booze off Eva Fox . Lots of voters do n't like spongers . Hardly anybody . So , was I you , I 'd keep my trap shut . "  | " He will , " Howie was quick to promise . " Strikes me we got a full understanding . Here 's the deal  --  no charge against the professor , like I already told you , and no loose lip from Kraker or me . Not a word . " His eyes raised in a question . " And none from you . Right ? " " Seems likely . " " That 's the deal , then , " Howie went on . " And I 'll tell Eva Fox she do n't necessarily have to let Sarge make free with her merchandise . That suit you , Mort ? All hunky-dory ? " " Suits , " Ewing said , and got to his feet . He had done what he could , all any man could , except that he would go see Eva Fox now . It was then that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was fat-headed ! The lamp flickered as he put his hand on the desk . " Where 's that damn Adelaide ? " A glance passed between Howie and Kraker . With a thumb Howie motioned over his shoulder . " In back . " " Jailed ? " " Just sleepin ' it off . We done it for her own good . Right , Sarge ? " " Sure . She was screamin ' around crazy , indoors and out . " " Close to the snakes , " Howie added . Ewing said , " I 'll have a look . " " No law against it , " Howie answered , " but she 's likely still cuckoo . Might be better to wait until Soo Son sends over some grub . " " I 'll see her now . " Sighing , Howie reached over to the wall and took keys from a hook . " Bring the lamp , Sarge . " He lifted himself from the chair and hitched at his belt with one hand , stepped to the back and unlocked and swung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lamp . The door opened on an aisle , which was flanked on one side by two cells . This much Ewing knew from before , having bailed out ap112seasonal ranch hand or two . What was new was the smell of the place . Kraker said , " Holy goddam ! " Howie was late in getting the scent . He halted and sampledit and blew out his breath and stepped ahead of the lamp , the keys swinging from his hand . He fumbled for one and turned the lock . " Bring the light . " The two pushed insidebefore Ewing and came to a stop . What Ewing saw first was the mussed bunk with nobody on it and the pot that stood at its foot . Then he moved to one . side and could see the woman on the floor . Howie was calling , " Adelaide . Hey , you , Adelaide ! " The woman had discarded most of her clothing , torn and discarded it in some dark frenzy , and lay almost naked on her stomach . She had fouled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own vomit . " Adelaide ! " But one look was enough , one look and the smell of the place to which , it seemed to Ewing , death added its stink to indignity . While he waited for decision to come to him , Howie began swinging the keys . They ran shadows across the floor and up the side wall . " How long since you checked on her , Sarge ? " " Not since early this morning . Hell , I 've been out . " Howie nodded . " Me , too . " Then , as if there were nothing else for it , he went forward and stooped . He pulled one of the woman 's arms out from her body and felt for the pulse . He took hold of her back hair and lifted the face away from its smear and half turned the head and with the thumb opened an eyelid . " Closer with that lamp , Sarge . " After his examination he stood up . " I 'm afraid she 's damn dead , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but nobody to blame . "  | " Nobody , " Ewing answered , and turned and walked away from the stink . Outside on the darkened street he was tempted to mount his horse and take off for the ranch . Enough was enough , and yet not enough . There remained Eva Fox and an accounting . I-Iere and there lights were on , shafting yellow into the night . A team and a saddle horse stood hitched to the rack at the side of the Arfive Mercantile ; but most people were home at this hour , relaxed and ready for supper or already stuffing their mouths or digesting what had been set before them . Early for this time of year , not to be explained by the weather yet , but overhead wild geese were honking , bucking up one another for this too-soon trip through the night . And there was a good girl in school and a poor whore who had convenientlydied because barkeeps were happy to sell to her and there was a pursy sheriff and a dimwitted deputy and a game and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixer . And shit . Mere Marsh was locking up . He came forward as if wanting to talk , no doubt about the set-to this morning ; and Ewing went by with only an " Evening , Marsh . " He did n't take the side steps to Eva 's . He mounted to the front door and found no one in the parlor and made his way to Eva 's office and entered it without knocking . She looked up from her desk , smiled and asked , " Since when do n't you rap , Mort ? " " Since today . " She indicated a chair . " Take the load off . " " Yes , " he said . " I will . " She waited , impassive , only her eyes seeming alive in the calm of her face . " You know about Collingsworth and Kraker this morning ? " " More or less vaguely . Your professor must be quite a man . "  | " You know the cause of it ? " " As much as anyone seems to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No names . " " And you can sit there , calm as you please , and it was you that tied a can onto Adelaide ! " She leaned forward abruptly and began to shake a hand at him , yet her actions seemed defensive . " Of course I fired her . She was a drunk and a cheat . " " And she blabbed to Kraker . What the hell did you think ? " Eva brought her hands together . Her eyes went away from his . " I was afraid , Mort , afraid when I heard about the ructionthis morning , but I swear I never thought Adelaide would tattle . Damn her soul to hell ! Now you leave Kraker to me . I 'll shut him up . " " No need to . But what made you think Adelaide would keep mum ? Why did n't you give her some going-away money ? " Eva came forward again , and again her hand shook at him . " I tried to . I offered more than enough to take her from town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three hundred dollars . Said she 'd stay right in town and hook on her own unless I gave her that much . I got mad . Dammit , you think I can come up with three hundred dollars for every chippie that ever works here ? " " You did n't get in touch with me . " " You would n't have come up with it , and I would n't ask . " " I 'd have come up with something . Acting on your own , you 've put the professor and me and Juliet Justice in a spot , and I do n't know for sure I can wiggle us out . I think maybe . Maybe I have . But it 's a cinch you have n't kept faith . You plain let us down . " " Have it your way , and I 'm sorry , sorry about Juliet and all ,  |p115as  sorry as I 've ever been . " With sudden concern , or what passed for it , she asked , " You 're not giving up on her ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " That 's not so , and you know it , and go to hell , Mort ! Bad as it came out , I did what I had to , the only thing that I could . I 'm not rotten rich like some I could name . " A muscle ridged itself against one point of her jaw , and it seemed to Ewing , looking at her , that what he had considered the clean lines of her face were the lines of hard cash . Who could say , considering this and that and the other ? Anyhow , the time came now and then that cash put its brand on the whole herd . Eva asked , " You would n't want me to take Adelaide back so as to hush her ? " " No , " Ewing answered , and rose and made for the door to the outside staircase . He had his hand on the knob when she said , " Adelaide was a good girl once . " " All of them were once . " Before he closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a good girl again . Anyhow , she 's dead . " He did n't wait for her answer.  |p116As  SOON AS school let out on Monday , Collingsworth walked home , not tarrying , as he usually did , to consider papers and problems . Though nothing pointed had been said and nothingopen done during the day , the atmosphere had altered . The students kept looking at him , with questions and speculationsin their eyes , and between classes and at noon had gathered in twos and threes for conversations that ceased when he approached . Little Miss Carson gave no indication at all that she had heard anything . She would n't have , anyhow . Always she was strictly business in school . If Juliet Justiceknew of the reasons for his punching Kraker , she showed no sign . It would seem that all were aware of the fact and no one aware of the cause . Though he had felt uncomfortable , something like a bug under a microscope , it was just as well , he supposed , that the students knew what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or fewer problems , with discipline . But a sidewalk altercation was a poor way to get it . The sun was about to sink over the mountains , leaving as proof of its trip a great arch of cloud , honey-colored , beneath which fires burned . A beautiful sight , he thought , yet somehowominous , as if the heavens were showing what might they could exercise.  |p117After  he had opened and closed his front door , May called from the kitchen , " Benton ? Brother Harrison 's waiting to see you . He went into the sitting room and received Mr. Harrison 's hearty " Good afternoon . How do things fare with you , Brother Collingsworth ? " The man 's grip was possessive . Collingsworth answered that things fared all right and asked Mr. Harrison to sit down again . Mr. Harrison laced his fingers across his stomach . The vague grooves of trouble troubled his face . " I have come for advice , " he said . " If I can give it . " " You have heard of the death , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " No . " " She died in jail Saturday , the result of too much strong drink . She was a wanton "  --  Mr. Harrison had lowered his voice  --  " a fallen woman . " " Yes ? " " I have been asked to conduct the funeral services and so find myself in a trying situation , one I 've never before experienced in a long ministry . Not that I have n't presided at the last rites for sinners , though not of this sort  --  but always something hopeful , something kind , some bit of amelioration , could be said for them . " " Who asked you ? " " That adds to my difficulties . A note came from that woman called Eva Fox . Brother Collingsworth , surely she would n't profane the house of God with her presence ? " " I do n't know , but you could hardly conduct services at her house . " " Oh , no ! Goodness , no ! " " Conduct them at the graveside . Is n't that best ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes ,  |p118though  I 'm not sure that such was intended in the request . Besides , graveside services always strike me as bleak , as removed , so to speak , from the seat and shelter of worship . " Collingsworth kept silent , though he was tempted to say that on occasion God must journey forth from the church . Mr. Harrison went on , " So far as I know  --  and I 've asked around quite discreetly  --  there 's not one single thing to be said for this lost soul . ' Why , not even her last name is known . What words can I speak in her favor ? Where is one covering grace ? " Twice now , twice recently for no reason except some relationshipof subject , lines from " The Bridge of Sighs " sang in Collingsworth 's head . The poem was no more than a highly adroit exercise in sentimentality , but still the lines sang : Owning her weakness , Her evil behavior , And leaving , with meekness , Her sins to her Saviour ! Aloud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harrison ? Why must it be personal ? " " It 's part of the service . It 's always expected . " And usually wrong , Collingsworth thought , usually in bad taste , usually embarrassing with its charitable exaggerations of perished and personal graces , if any . " Read some prayers and something out of the Bible , like Psalms . That 's my advice . " " Well , " Mr. Harrison answered , counting his fingers , " I may do just that , but it 's so true , is n't it , the wages of sin ? " " If death is the proof , then we 're all paid in the same coin . " Mr. Harrison thought a minute . The smile that he turned on Collingsworth then had in it the pinch of reserve . " The hereafter  --  but you 're just trying to guy me a little . I 'm on to you , Brother Collingsworth. "  |p119Collingsworth  answered , " I knew you would be . " The reply appeared satisfactory . " I 'll surely think on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no move to go . His mouth shaped a word but left it unuttered . At last he ventured , " You did n't linger after services Sunday . " The statement required no response , and Collingsworth made none , though he suspected what now was on Mr. Harrison'smind . " You 've had your own trouble , I know , Brother Collingsworth . I should n't burden you with mine . " " What did you hear ? " " It 's common knowledge . That you knocked down the deputysheriff . " Mr. Harrison extended a generous hand . " I am not being inquisitive , but if it would help you to talk about it ? " I am sure you had good reason , " he went on , apparently encouraged by silence , " but as it is , in the dark , so to speak , what can your friends and supporters say except that the incidentwas unfortunate ? " " Nothing . " " Mr. Marsh and I were discussing it . " " And both regretted it ? " " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's done . That 's that . " " Do n't get me wrong . I 'm sure there was real provocation . " Mr. Harrison 's gaze came up , still hopeful of an answer . " Good . " Slowly , as if under the weight of things unsettled , Mr. Harrisonrose to his feet . " Thanks for your advice , brother . " As they went to the door , Collingsworth answered , " Anytime . " He said good-bye and swung the door to . People with their certitudes ! People with their pushing curiosity ! Mr. Harrison , as sure of the Word as he was lost for an explanation ! Certitude and curiosity , and the devil take both !  |p120Mav  came from the kitchen with Mary Jess trailing along . An apron circled her just-swelling front . A lock of escaped hair dangled over her forehead . She listened an instant as Tommie cried from the bcdroom , the look of care deepening on her face . " I 'm glad you contained yourself , " she said . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hush . " May made a backward gesture toward Mary Jess . " Who , Father ? " Mary Jess asked . " Who do you want to kick ? " " Whom , " he said . " No one you know , " May told her . The truth shall set you free , but fibs were the ticket for children . " I did n't go for the mail , " he said . May looked at him . " People and their infernal curiosity ! I wo n't put up with it . " " What will you do , Benton ? Wait till it kills all the cats ? " " All right . All right . " He did n't feel like grinning . " Then you can pick up some onions . I have n't a one for the stew . " He was at the point of asking why not , since the grocery wagon took orders and made daily deliveries , but then he took note of how worn she appeared . He told himself , not for the first time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughtful . " Sure , Maysie . No trouble , " he said . " Anyhow , Mere Marsh will want a look at his gladiator . " Outside , dusk was coming on , delayed by the bright sea of sky in the west . Above the sea , like an inverted bank , the long honey arch rested , a shade darker now , the color of wild honey taken from bee trees in boyhood Indiana . Out of the north , the limitless north , came a breeze with tidings of winter . Soon , he supposed , men lucky enough to own buffalo overcoatswould put them on , glad to be warm though weighed down . He snugged his own old cloth coat about his neck . He could do with a new one , but , Lord , May came first andp121Mary Jess and Tommie and the house and the baby a-coming . All on a schoolteacher 's salary . Thank heavens , neither Maysienor he was overfond of possessions , never having had many . Even in old things , a man could keep himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as he remembered a tie . Already the store was lighted , but the lamp shine that came through the windows seemed pallid and false as against the western sky 's permeation . Seeking the light , men put a match to a kerosene wick . Inside were just Bill Robinson , the choir 's faithful quaver , and Merc Marsh himself . Marsh sat on a high stool before a high desk , pencil in hand , eyeshade drawn down , sleeve protectorsin place . He looked up as Collingsworth entered , then returned to his work . Approaching , Bill Robinson asked , " Yes , sir , Professor ? " It appeared to Collingsworth that there was more in his eyes than the request for an order . " A few onions . That 's all tonight . A small sack . " After Robinson had complied and marked down the charge , Collingsworth stepped along the aisle , carrying his purchase . He stopped in front of the high desk and said , " Good evening , Mac . " " Good evening , Professor Collingsworth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was as vacant as a blackboard , innocentof chalk , misspellings , constructions and Q.E.D. 's . Profit above position . The face of business . He did volunteer , " Nice out . " Then he went back to his pencil work . Collingsworth waited an instant , but no more was coming . He went to the door and let himself out , imagining that Marsh 's gaze had been fixed on his back . He was a little astonished , walking on to the post office , when a man he did n't know said to him , " Flow are you , Profes/sor ? " Apparently the man was a lounger , a roughneck possibly , but his expression was friendly and smiling , and his eyes projected no questions . Collingsworth answered , " Fine . Thank you . " He came to a group of three men then , two of whom he knew by name only , and , as old Charlie Blackman would have said , they sang out hellos . He replied civilly , brushed by the sense of initiation into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of his place and stepped out as Collingsworth neared and stopped him almost at the very spot of Saturday 's trouble . His expression was n't belligerent . It was as grave as a headstone . He extended a hand that might have belonged to a lady . " Professor Collingsworth , " he said , " may I make bold to thank you ? " He added , " For many things . " Quickly , then , as if not expecting or wanting acknowledgment , he turned his great hulk around and disappeared inside . After Benton had gone , May picked up Tommie and changed his diapers and brought him to the kitchen and fed him . He could eat porridge now and mashed vegetables and bits of graham cracker that drooled from his mouth and had to be spooned from his chin and reintroduced . He had taken to a bottle readily enough , though sometimes he still nuzzled for her as if his little mind could recall better sources . She put him back in bed with a warmed bottle slanted down from a pillow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table , being exact about it as she 'd been taught . Even the napkins , rolled in their rings , were put each in its proper place . Already the child could read the inscriptions . She could do more than that . Once she saw the shape of a printed word and heard the sound of it , she did n't forget.  |p123For  such a daughter , thank the heavens , and thanks for Tommie , too , and , pray God , let him grow big and strong . One thing , he ate well enough . The stew was simmering . In addition to meat , she had put into it potatoes and rutabagas and carrots . It lacked onions , which would be supplied shortly , and okra , which no one in town seemed to have heard of . At home a stew without okra was hardly a stew . She put a basin of sour milk in the churn and sat down and began paddling it , half aware that the paddle rose and fell to the pace of her thoughts . Some people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult man , as , to be truthful , he could be . But those severe in their judgments , as her own parents were wont to be , did not know the man . Noting his aberrant moods , they went no further . They did n't know the depth of him , the rightness and virtue , the enduring commitment to family and the good life . He needed understanding , to be sure , and he needed returned love . But they were all he needed , and he had them ; and his unaccountable humors melted away as a consequence . Underneath , he was a tender man and one as capable of fun and merriment as any husband known . She could smile , as many times she had , at a remembrance now stirred somehow by the splash of the paddle . It was early in their married life , and they were abed at night , and she had asked Benton please to get up and bring a glass of water . " Why , " he had answered , " get it yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she had thought to leave him and go home . What foolishness ! She had been spoiled , as all girls were spoiled , by the silly customs of courtship . Maidens were to be wooed . They were to be danced attendance on . They were to be treated , not just as precious , but as helpless , fragile as a piece of heired china too fine for use . They had to learn later ,  |p124as  they should have been taught , to get their own water , barringdisability alone . She stopped churning when Benton came in . He laid a sack on the table . " No mail . There 's your onions . " " Thank you , Benton . I 'll put them right in . " " And the so-called schoolteacher , better known for his fisticuffs , now will go milk . " He went to the back entryway , shed his coat in favor of an old sweater and drew a pair of overalls over his trousers . Then he picked up the clean pail and went out . May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stew kettle and moved the kettle to a hotter spot on the range . The fire was all right . It was Benton that was n't . Later she took the foaming bucket from him and strained the milk and set it aside to cool . " Supper 's ready , " she said . After grace , which Benton said as if hard put to find blessings , they ate in silence . Even Mary Jess had come to respect her father 's moods . The little thing beamed when he beamed and sobered when he did . Afterward Benton went into the parlor , probably to read more of Hawthorne , whose works he was going over again ; and , with the help of Mary Jess , May took the dishes out to the kitchen , dipped water from the reservoir at the end of the range , made it hotter with an addition from the teakettle and started to tidy up . She had rinsed the last dish when she heard Benton 's laugh . The why of it she could n't imagine . What was funny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cloud had lifted , and she gave the dish to Mary Jess to dry and went into the parlor . Benton was chuckling now . On his face was the twisted , slightly impish , wry-more-than-mirthful smile that incongruity often brought to it . The opened book lay face down on his lap . " Guess what ? " he asked  | " Tell me . " " Before you you see not only the preacher 's doubt and the storekeeper 's discard but also the ne'er-do-wells ' choice and the saloon owner 's friend . " " What , Benton ? " " Maysie , I 've swapped constituencies . "  |p129COLLINGSWORTH  SAT in study hall after school was dismissed , for the moment preferring this second-floor space to his downstairsoffice . Motes of still-unsettled dust patterned the sunlightthat streamed soft through the westward windows , but silence had come and quiescence after the coughs and questionsand fidgets of students ; and from here , if he went to look , the view , right or left , was better than from below . But it was good just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was May , the tender month , the beginning burgeoning , the last month of school . How different from just six weeks or so past , when a spring blizzard had struck and left lambs dying and dead all over the Breast River country . Poor Jay Ross , who like many another had switched from cattle to sheep , in prosperity calling them the golden hoof . Now the frozen hoof was more like it . The scene flowed before him . All the land a glare of snow , small-humped where it glistened over downed lambs and old ewes , and Jay , bundled and booted , his face expressionless as be and his men had pitched carcasses into hayracks pulled by teams breathing white . Free on that Saturday , he himself had taken a hand . Pausing once after having flung a Iamb in the rack , Jayp130smiled a smile not of defeat . " I 'll wind , Prof , " he said . " Now the missus will have more ammunition . " Collingsworth looked at him and gazed around . The sky was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When a man tried to look across the fields of snow , his eyes pinched up . Not a breeze moved . The wind was as dead as a carcass . " It 's not just the wind sets her off , " Jay went on as if noting the stillness . For an instant a glint of dumb puzzlement came to his face . " I do n't know , Prof , but was she a horse , I 'd think about loco . " All Collingsworth could think of to say was , " She 's just upset . It will pass . " " Hope so . Like hard times ; they 'll pass , too . " His thoughts , Collingsworth guessed , had shifted to sheep and losses and bank account and to days ahead . On his face grew the look of resolution , of utter confidence . " I been in worse fixes . Something weak in a man who hollers out uncle . " It struck Collingsworth that Ross spoke for himself alone . Out of his own energies , his native @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would master the fates . From this fierce but lovely young land he would wrest fortune . He envied Ross 's animal confidence , wondering if education would have altered and weakened it . Books made a man wonder . Books made the whole man , and the whole man doubted himself . But it was difficult to think that anything ever would have changed Ross , that ever his native hue of resolution could have been sicklied over with the pale cast of thought . Ilimself he was born , the seed sown with conception . Collingsworth rose from the desk and went to an east windowfrom which he could see most of the town . Yonder was the new courthouse , made of native stone hewn from Breast Butte , and to his left the grade school that matched it . They looked a bit like buttes themselves , fashioned and turreted buttes fitting to countryside . By contrast , his high school ,  |p131I  made of buff brick , stood boxlike and alien to its surroundings . But it could be said in its favor that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It sufficed and would do so long after his tenure . Long after his tenure , though Arfive was growing . Seven years  --  and already it was half again as big as when he first saw it . Idly , without order , while he watched the occasional stirrings of town , he let drift through his mind the additions to be counted since that long-ago but not-so-long-ago time . A bank now and a store to compete with Mere Marsh , both run by Jews . A resident doctor . A resident dentist . A resident lawyer . A third high-school teacher . A four-page newspaper that alcohol edited and occasionally did n't . A couple of questionableland locators , for the flow of homesteaders had becomesomewhat more than a trickle . A commerical club , no less , of which he was a good if questioning member . A telephonesystem , already once improved , which not everyone could afford to subscribe to . Some of the close-in ranchers , like Mort Ewing , had connected , however , though wet weather grounded the top wires of fences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk of a post office divorcedfrom the drugstore . There was talk of electric lights and a railroad spur from Great Falls . The town should incorporate , the commercial club believed . Growth . People and more people , drawn by real or imagined opportunity in commerceand field . Beyond the town , beyond the wintered trees of the valley , the cemetery lay on the slope that led up to the benchlands . Its headstones , catching the afternoon light , looked like the remnant rubble of a forgotten upheaval . The cemetery had grown along with the town . In its population now were the two he had had to put there  --  little Tommie , who had witheredto death , and Charlotte , the baby , who had lived hardly long enough to be named.  |p132To  his ears came May 's cry , the never-answered cry of all those bereaved . " Why did it happen to us ? Why did it have to happen ? " " Bronchitis , " the doctor had said . He turned away from the window and followed the sun across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see Cashman Coulee , denting the bench that slanted down to the valley . Part of it was shaded and part of it still bright with sun , and all of it lay secluded and private as it had since old Johnny Cashman , in years that only the oldest remembered , had tried to make a go of things there and gone off defeated , leaving the work of his hands to the work of the elements . There remained of ambition forsaken only a board or two , a stone , a shoveled hollow , as remote in time as a teepee ring and as unobtrusive . A man hunting , feeling the whispers of old return about him , always could bag a brace or two of teal in the potholes of the coulee . Or , feeling older whispers , he could hunt for arrowheads , left or lost by untamed Indians who had driven buffalo to wreck or death down the leftward bluff and so made meat for winter . Or he could sit among the sandstone toadstoolsand listen to the wind that carved them . Farther @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky . The lonely mountains , he thought , the lonely purity of mountains , with Elephant Ear Butte standing grand like a guarantee of grace . He had supposed the school deserted , but now he heard footsteps and voices and looked toward the door and saw Miss Carson coming in . With her was a dark , thin girl , part Indian by appearance , whom Miss Carson had to encourage to come forward . " Excuse me , Mr. Collingsworth , " Miss Carson said . " I wondered if you had a minute ? "  | " Of course , " he answered , and motioned toward the closest row of desks . " Wo n't you sit down ? " " May I introduce Marie Wolf ? " He acknowledged the introduction , thinking the girl was probably French and Indian . Lame Wolf or Hiding Wolf or some such variation might be her Blackfoot name . While they were seating themselves , it passed through his mind that he would always have time for Miss Carson . She was a faithful , no-nonsense , excellent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be she was n't one of those justgraduated , fugitive misses who taught for a term and got married . Her first interests were the school , the students and church . And it was pleasant to know she was loyal . " Marie wants to go to school here next year . " He said , " I see . " What his eyes saw was a girl with that first flush of beauty , that fugitive flush , that part-bloods so often had . It was likely she 'd become a fat and unlovely squaw , but now she was trim and dear and graceful as well , if what movements she 'd made were indicative . In the thin , copper face the eyes were enormous , enormous and liquid , perhaps with fright . " Marie 's been going to school at Shaw Academy , " Miss Carson continued . " It was there I met her . " " Last year ? " " Yes , of course . During that inspection they asked us to make . " " You were n't impressed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shelved my report . But I was impressed with Marie . " " Indian schools are hardly up to standard , " he said . " As you reported , only two instructors and those ill-prepared , health and sanitation indifferent , church dogma put above education . "  |p134As  he spoke , he was seeing the Indian encampments that , fall and spring , sprouted on the south edge of Arfive , seeing the tattered teepees , the cayuses , carts and wagons , the dirty curs , the relict bucks and squaws and progeny , all squatted at this point between school and reservation . It was a celebration , this accompaniment of pupils , and it was noxious , and it was pitiful . " Marie is as much above the Shaw standard as our standard is above its , " Miss Carson was saying . " She 's much the best student of all . I 've checked the record and I 've talked to her , both there and here , where she looked me up . Shaw has no more for her . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appears irregular , " he said , somehow not wanting to close the door on this war whoop , as superior white men called Indians . " If I remember rightly , Mr. Collingsworth , " Miss Carson said , smiling , " you ventured irregularity once before  --  and with no regrets . " He had to smile in return . " Your memory 's in good shape . And now you want me to push my luck . " While they waited for him to go on , he looked again at the girl , who had hardly moved since sitting down . Was there , in those dark eyes , in that tan face , the appearance of intelligence ? Winsome she undoubtedly was . Too winsome probably . He could imagine , looking ahead , the agitation of some white father whose son insisted on courting her . But pretty was as pretty did . Did winsomeness combine with wit ? Could education overcome the teepee ? Was there any back to her head ? He must admit somewhat in her favor that the Indians never had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or their hybrids . They had been proud once , maybe clean , though certainlypagan , and they had been chivvied and cheated and altogether debauched , and who cared ? It was still felt if notp135often said anymore that death made a good Indian . To be sure , the little breeds from the south fringe of town went sometimes to grammar school  --  from shacks and cabins that discouraged brooms and mops . They came from families too poor for a pot . They came lousy and often enough smelling of skunk , for skunk meat was better than none . They came bewildered , out of place , minus grounding . They came and failed and disappeared , untouched or hurt by experience . Never before had one sought admission to high school . " I was woolgathering , " he said by way of apology . " Where would you stay , Marie ? With your family ? " The girl gave a grave shake of her head . " It is too far . They arc poor , " she answered . Her voice was soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She spread her small hands . " All of us are poor . " Her tone was matter-of-fact , not resentful , though he supposed she meant to include the whole tribe . Miss Carson said , " If you take her , I 'll sponsor her . Actually , I 'm tired of one room . Even before Marie looked me up , I had arranged with Mr. Leonard Wither to rent that little house of his next fall . You know the one  --  kitty-cornered from grade school ? It 's adequate for two . " " We would have to take you on trial , Marie , " he said . " Your grades would be important , more so than in most instances . They 'd have to be good . " What the girl was feeling , he could n't tell . Except for the luminosity of eye , her face did n't speak . Indians , he knew , could be like that , impassive as statuary , impassive in her case as a figurine . " I 'll help her if need be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girl answered him . " I know . I will . " " Then let 's call it settled . " " I 'm so grateful , Mr. Collingsworth . " Miss Carson got up . " Marie ? " The girl rose then . " Thank you many times . "  | " Your thanks go to Miss Carson , " he said . " She 's respon-sible . " The two started for the door . Then the girl paused and turned and said , " I 'll do good . I promise . " Her grammar , Collingsworth thought as they disappeared , could stand some help , but for that matter what student 's could n't ? Except for one , and she was gone . Except for one he 'd admitted with doubt as he had admitted this little Marie . Though the memories of satisfaction held constant , the years fused and mixed . It was difficult to believe that four school terms had passed since Juliet Justice had made her addressand that fall had gone on to the University of Montana at Missoula @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her degree . Three years in high school , only three years , and those remembered as image rather than time , and then graduation as valedictorian . To think of her was to see her . To see her was to canvass the adjectives . Neat there in the front row . Prompt . Cooperative . Gracious . Alert . Even radiant . But adjectives were empty . In the field of C minds , she was the sport , the A-plus ; and there was the teacher 's reward . Sin , he thought , was n't always the winner . If her past claimed any due , it was negative and reverse . It was her seemingindifference to boys . Save for public functions , which she attended with other girls and sometimes Mort Ewing , her excursionsfrom the Adlam household had been pretty well limitedto weekend and vacation visits to the R5 , proper and rightful visits , no matter how gossip might have it , to the home of her known benefactor . If also , in the absence of kin , she had come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was no doubt about it , Ewing had found a daughter , found her and paid for her education and been proud . He had let it be known that he would go to Missoula for her graduation.  |p137Maybe  , just maybe , this little Marie , this shy offal-eater from the reservation , would turn out well , too . Collingsworth took the watch from his vest and flicked the lid open and saw it was time to go home . The soft , lengtheningdays had a way of confusing a man . First , though , he must arrange a table and chairs for the confounded schoolboardmeeting tonight . It appeared to Collingsworth that Jay Ross never ran out of cigars  --  his vest pockets bulged with them  --  nor was he ever reluctant to pass them . As he was about to finger some out , he asked , " Sure the smoke does n't mortify you , Miss Stone-house ? " " Not at all . I enjoy it . " Miss Stonehouse was the newly elected county superintendent of schools and as such sat in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men members . Having taught first grade for a couple of years , she was abundantly qualified for her position . Besides , she had had no opposition . The room would have to be aired out later , Collingsworth reflected . He had to admit he liked tobacco himself , but it would not be fitting that young people enter a room heavy with dead smoke . " Full tally tonight , " Mort Ewing said needlessly as he looked around the table at which they all sat . It had been plain from the first that he did n't much like to preside . Not in seven years had the board changed  --  which testified to public satisfaction or apathy . There was the new county superintendent , of course , and there was Bill Robinson , Merc Marsh 's man , now acting as paid clerk , but here were Ewing and Ross and Merc Marsh and old Mr. McLaine whose hand , raising a match , had a tremor at odds with his mind . Ewing rustled the few papers in front of him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , come another school year . I reckon you 've read ' em . " He had a habit of relapsing into southernisms when presiding , as if formality goaded him . " Total count , near as he can calculate , comes nigh onto two thousand dollars . Biggest single item is to outfit two classroomswe 've left bare until needed . Time 's come , he says , or next fall will catch us . There 's coal to buy , too , and supplies and whatnot . But you know all that a'ready . " " I believe , " Merc Marsh said , his smile maybe asking forgiveness , " that procedure requires we approve the minutes of the last meeting first . " " You 're a great one for order , Merc . " Mr. McLaine leaned forward and shakily tipped the ash off his cigar . " I move the reading of the minutes of the last meetingbe dispensed with . " No one voted nay . " Now , " Mr. McLainesaid , " we all know that the school needs these things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no disagreement . And so I move to approve  --  " " Just a minute , " Marsh broke in . " I may be a little ahead of myself , but still it 's a thing we have to discuss . No disagreementabout the items , I 'll grant . But about the cost ? " " Of course it 's an estimate , " Collingsworth said , " but an estimate based on the comparative prices in a good many catalogues . Possibly we can purchase for less . " Marsh spoke to the rest of them . " The professor 's not a businessman and not supposed to be . I 'll guarantee that figure can be cut , just how much I do n't know . What I mean is that I 'll undertake to get it for less . Naturally my store has connections . " Ewing said , " So ? Just leave it to you , huh ? " " That way we 'll not only save money but keep it at home . You 'll admit that 's desirable ? " " Yep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " All the desk carpenters we got around here and the coal miners and themp139as whittle chalk and mold inkwells  --  they got to come first . " Collingsworth saw the blood starting up Marsh 's face . Exceptfor Ewing and Mr. McLaine , he could n't be sure the others saw the real issue in the proposal , though Ross could be expected to back him . Miss Stonehouse , sitting prim , appeared to be thinking . Robinson had his pen poised over his tablet , no doubt hoping to record that his boss had been granted the contract . " It would be against my advice , " he said then . Marsh asked , " Why ? " " Because you 're a member of the board . " " It 's known as a conflict of interest . " With his snowy beard Mr. McLaine was remindful of a picture of Moses . " You would have opposing concerns , your own and the school 's . " " Even if I could save the school money ? " Ross moved in his chair . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Marsh . Ca n't you see ? No matter what , it would look bad for us . A put-up job , people would say . " " And you got a boy about ready for high school , " Ewing added . " Thinks high of you , I bet . " He said no more , choosing , Collingsworth supposed , to let this aside move into the current of thought . He fashioned a cigarette with the skill of long practice . " I give up , " Marsh said , summoning his storekeeper 's manner . After all , here were customers . " Sure has its twists and turns , this being a board member . " " I move we approve the list and ask for bids , if it appears to Mr. Collingsworth that 's the best way , " Mr. McLaine said . " Ile knows the school-supply houses . " Ross seconded the motion . It passed without dissent . " All right , " Ewing said , picking up a page of paper . " Under new business here 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All hands know who he is , I reckon ? " His eyes questioned the others . " Miss Stonehouse , he sure must be ap140name to you . Big liquor distributor out of Great Falls , not to mention other interests . Got a wad that would plug a culvert . I 'll pass this letter around , but what he offers to do is to give a twenty-five-dollar prize for the top student in each class every year . " He gave the letter to Ross , who read it and handed it on . For a moment , after it had been returned to him , he sat silent , apparently waiting for comment . At last Miss Stonehouse ventured , " It would be an encouragement , a boost , if I may say so , for greater application to studies . " She was an addlepate he 'd probably have to set right , Collingsworthreflected . With an effort he kept silent , reminding himself , before he forgot , that he was the instrument of the board 's decisions . Legally it was for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it out  --  which made him a eunuch if he obliged . " Sure thing , " Marsh said . " Brudd can spare it , the kids can use it . Open and shut , I would say . " " Anyone else ? " Ewing asked . " No ? Prof , what 's your no-tion ? " Collingsworth pushed back his chair and got to his feet . " My notion is no , " he said , letting his voice be as harsh as it wished . " Respectability for that man ! Even the odor of it ! No ! He wants to buy it , not having any . He wants good will for ill deeds . Call it vanity in him . Imagine it to be restitution . Say it 's business promotion , as in large part it must be . No matter . It 's bad . " Ross said , " Whoa , Prof. It 's still money . " " Tainted money . That man has done more to corrupt this whole section than any other man you can name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but from loyalty more than conviction . Even obvious moral considerationslike this one were likely to be unclear in his mind.  | " It 's for us to decide , " Marsh said , not looking at Collingsworth . " What does it matter , the source of the money ? Good kids would get a reward . " " Not while I 'm principal . " Now Marsh looked his way . " Professor , that sounds mighty close to a threat . " " Make it a fact . " Smiling , Ewing raised his hand , palm out . " Easy , Prof. " For a moment more Collingsworth remained on his feet , then sat clown slowly . " I move , " Mr. McLaine said , his beard moving to the involuntaryshake of his face , " that the board decline this kind offer . " Put to a vote , the motion passed , only Mere Marsh dissenting . A quotation ran through Collingsworth 's head . " So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain  --  " " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjourn ? " Outside the school building Ewing exchanged leave-takings and started up the boardwalk with Jay Ross . " Save walkin ' , " he said to make conversation , " if we 'd drove our rigs here , ' stead of tyin ' up at McCabe 's . " " Yep . " Jay was wearing that damn derby hat . Wanted to be a nabob , maybe , or to josh them as thought they were . The moonlight played on the hat . They walked on in silence until Ewing said , " It 's hell to be right . " " Anyhow , all the time , " Ross answered . " If anybody is . " Somehow Ross 's remark put the mind to working . Collingsworthhad been right all right , yet dedication was one of those jim-dandy words that , if practiced , a man shied away from . It was too sure . It did n't allow for any maggot in vir/tue , not even so much as its opposite owned up to its maggots . But a man had to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said was , " It 's not only hell but damn lonely . " " I do n't know . Teaching . Church work . Tuba in the Silver Cornet Band . And his wife leading those teetotal biddies . What do you call it ? The Women 's Christian Temperance Union . " " Anyhow , we 're lucky he stays on  --  iron face and iron voice and all , when he gets filed . " " Sure , " Ross said , and after a while added , " Nick Brudd 's in town . He wo n't like it much . " " You scare me . " " I bet I do . " They had reached Adlam 's saloon . " Come in and have a drink . " A half-dozen men were in the place . Brudd stood at the bar , talking to Adlam . He turned his head at the sound of their entrance . " Live ones , " he said . " Fatty , bring drinks to the gentlemen . " He moved to the back , rested a hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook his round , derbied head . Ewing said , " We been savin ' your hard-earned money , Nick . " Brudd narrowed his eyes . Ewing thought he saw a gleam in them . " First turndown but who cares ? There 's other schools eager . Unanimous , was it ? " " Nope , " Ewing answered . " Mere Marsh was all for it , him being so sensible . " " But you two ? " " Was in the majority , " Ewing answered . Brudd made a show of shaking his head , as if in dumb wonder , but the eyes at the sides of his hawk 's beak of a nose gave the lie to his act . " A man would almost think that preacher-principal had something on you . "  |p143Before  Ewing could speak , Ross said , " He has . What he has on us is that he 's maybe got the best school in the state . If we do n't always see eye to eye with him , like I do n't , we figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we string along . You better believe it . " It was a long speech for Ross and warm-spoken , too , and Brudd answered , " Aw , pull up , Jay . Nothing meant . " He pushed his hat back on his bald head and so put his face out of true . His brow was too high for a bird 's . " It 's just , well , a good-intended man gets a kick in the ass . You know how that is . But that hand 's been played , and it was n't much stakes in the first place . Speaking of that , how about a friendly game ? Judge Secrest said he 'd come along by and by . " " Not tonight , " Ewing answered . Friendly game , Brudd had said . Like always , but now maybe more so , he meant cutthroat . Ewing turned and walked out , giving Adlam a wave of good-bye on the way . There were four of them at the table  --  Nick Brudd , Jay Ross , Judge Secrest and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't known before . They disdained chips  --  each had brought his stake with him  --  and they had agreed to play no-limit straight stud and to discard the joker , though in cow-country games it was usually played as a match for an ace and a wild card in both straights and flushes . A sure-enough gamblers ' game , Adlam thought as he returned to the bar after serving them and began dousing glasses . Big stakes and let losers cry . A kind of worrisome thing if you had a friend in the play . But let the chips  --  the bills  --  fall . He had n't promoted the game , except to sell two decks of cards and provide a table and chairs . He took no cut and never had , wanting the layout to be a convenience for customerswho liked modest play . What little profit he made ,  |p144aside  from whatever good will totaled up , he made from the sale of drinks and decks . " Yes , sir , my friend , " he said to a customer who looked like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass of beer for a chaser . " Private affair ? " the man asked , looking back toward the players . " Unless you 're loaded . " The man shook his head , drank shot and chaser and went out . The two other customers at the bar , Adlam knew from before , would spend an hour in occasional conversation over one beer apiece . His attention went back to the gamblers . He could n't see the actual play . He drew on his knowledge . Ross was a bold player , a frequentbluffer who , like many a one , hated the thought of being bluffed himself . Secrest had been a judge all right , by appointment , and still practiced law here and there while drawinga salary from the federal government for some vague servicesin connection with the public domain . He played a close , lawyer 's game and would take care of himself . Combine bankroll , bumptiousness and craft , and you had Brudd . Tevis was new to Arfive . " Bring us a round , Fatty , " Brudd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the drinks , Adlam lingered long enough to see that Brudd was bulling the game . Raise and stiff raise and raise again . High and mighty poker  --  but there was no rule against wielding your roll . Bar luck , it was bad poker , though . Bar a sweet run of cards . While Adlam watched , Brudd fifth-carded Ross , drawing an ace to his hole card to top Ross 's kings . The pot was better than sizable . " Shit will do for brains if you 're lucky , " Brudd said , adding the pot to a pile that had grown . Three customers came in , and Adlam returned to the bar.  |p145One  of them , after a pull at his beer and a glance toward the rear , said , " We was hopin ' to work up a game , but not tonight , huh ? " " If you 'd staked out the table earlier  --  ? " " Sure , Fatty . Forget it . How does it go ? " " How would I know without horning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hell and gone both ways , too high and low for the likes of us . Fill ' em up again , will you ? " It was n't being too bad a night , Adlam reflected after the three had gone and still other drinkers dropped in . Nothing big , like Christmas Eve and the Fourth of July , but big enough to keep a barkeep fairly busy . He wished he could find a good , steady man to fill in so that he and his wife could go to Missoula to see Julie graduate . The trouble with fill-ins was they drank up the inventory and , stewed , kept serving drinks on the house . A lull came now , and it was time the house bought for the poker players . They had paid for five rounds in four hours or so . He arrived at the table during a hush . His " The roof leaked " did n't break it . He placed the glasses , saying no more , and stood back . Every man had stayed , and every man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jack , Tevis kings to an eight , Secrest nines to an ace and Brudd only treys to a deuce . " Pot right ? " Secrest said , holding the deck . The pot was a ragged clutter of bills . " Here comes the bad news , gentlemen . " With a judicial air he began calling the turns . " A jack to a jack and two pairs in sight . A four to the kings and no visible help . A trey to the treys and three of a kind . The dealer draws a deuce . " He glanced at the hands . " Your bet , Mr. Brudd . " Brudd fingered the bills at his side . " Three lousy treys do n't like to buck pairs in sight . Wo n't risk more than fifty . " He fluttered a bill into the pot.  |p146Secrest  said , " Dealer folds , " and pitched in his hand . Ross chewed on his cigar , his face showing nothing . Finally he said , " Call and raise it two hundred . " His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He would have been a fool to try to ride his two pairs over Brudd 's three of a kind . He had a full house , either jacks and tens or tens and jacks . Tevis turned over his cards and threw them in . " Well . Well . " Brudd had a habit of smiling , his mouth did , when he played poker . He looked at his treys and then gazed around . " The beauty of the game is you never know . You never know until showdown . Is Jay thinking he can run a wagon over yours truly ? Hmm . Could be . I 've known him to bluff . Shall I call ? Shall I raise ? " Ross said , " Take your time . " The others were silent . " Well , then , I will see you , Mr. Ross , and bump fifteen hundred . " In what must have been his courtroom voice , Secrest said , " Fifteen hundred ! " Brudd looked innocent , if he could . " I understood this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the raise . The raise was too ungodly steep , even for this game . It suggested a bluff . It suggested a cinch . A man from the bar , Bob Franklin , came from it and stood in the archway , looking on . Likely he had heard Secrest 's voice . Adlam 's thoughts pushed at Ross : Careful , Jay , careful : could be a bluff , but remember the fourth trey has n't shown . But Jay knew that much and would n't pay heed , even if the warning could have been spoken . He brought a steady match to the stub of his cigar . " I figure the pot 's worth the gamble , " Brudd said , his eyes going from one to the other as if all must agree . " I 'll see you . " Ross took from his mouth what was left of his cigar , examined it and dropped it in a spittoon . " Have top147draw shy . " He put in the pot what he had and drew to the side of it what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was the fourth trey . As if nickels were stakes , Ross said , " Beats a full house . " He showed his hand , jacks and tens , and took a checkbook from his hip pocket and with a stub pencil made out what he owed . " Not my night , " he told everyone , pushing his chair back . " So long until next time . " " Winner 'll buy a drink . " " At the bar for me , " Ross answered , and got up . " This sittinghas put a crimp in my tail . " Adlam followed him and poured him a shot , letting the others wait . Ross took it as always , not gulping but taking three measured swallows . " See you , " he said as he finished it . Adlam followed him to the door , bid him good-bye and stood breathing fresh air . A crimp in the tail was n't all that Ross had . Lamb loss , poker loss , crimps in his bank account sure as taxes and hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ livery stable . IIc had turned down it . Well , if it was that and she suited him , that gladsome wife of a here-and-gone husband ? If she cushioned his loss ? Anyhow , though Ross was cagey , might as well try to advise him about pussy as poker . The hard-headed , the horny , the kind of pitiful son of a bitch . Goddam it , Jay ! Inside , Brudd was calling for service . Out loud Adlam did n't say : Piss on you , Eagle Beak ! He went to pour drinks.  |p148A  MAN COULD SAY Missoula was a lost-and-gone town for a plainsman to get to , Ewing reflected as he sat in the smoker of the Western Express . No matter how figured , the trip took the better part of two days if a pilgrim wanted to arrive in time for a shindig set for 2 : 30 P.M.Team , Great Northern and now the Northern Pacific 's Express  --  that was the order , along with a choice of long waits in Helena . It was just as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrive in Missoula at night . This way had left Julie 's afternoonopen for last-minute stuff . She had n't been obliged , as she sure would have felt , to show him around . Tomorrow and commencement were time enough . There were quite a few men in the smoker , most of them landseekers , he reckoned , some of them in rough clothes and lace boots and some out of stores or offices back east . With their hands they kept shading the windows as if , looking out in the late dusk , they might see dollars growing out of the ground . The man at his side took his hand down . He wore a red mustache and bib overalls and smoked a pipe that would have gagged a gut wagon . " Goot country , dey say . " " You hear it , all right . "  | " Minnesota , I bane . Nort ' Dakota . Vind , it blow seed hell and gone . Cold , too . " " Worse than Norway ? " " Norvay all right , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offended . " But , you know , little and too many dere , and vere is land to settle ? Four small vones , I have , and my vife , and ve look for better . " The poor bastard , Ewing thought . All the poor bastards looking for Eden , looking beyond Norway , beyond Europe , beyond desk and counter , beyond east and midwest to full belliesand barns and glutted root cellars . And the only crop they could count on was kids . " Sure , I know , " he said . " You 'll make out all right . " " You bet . Goot country here . " The poor , hopeful bastard got up . " Excuse . Now I go see how family make out . " He walked down the aisle and went through the door . Tobacco smoke dimmed the dim lights of the coach , which smelled of pipes and cheap cigars and the remnants of homereadiedlunches and of the sandwiches and candies the train butcher had sold . Ewing slid over to the seat the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glass , peered through the window . The train , he supposed , now was rolling down the valley of the Clark 's Fork of the Columbia . The stream shimmeredand rippled in the late light , its meanders ruled by the shouldering mountains . A man of the plains felt a sort of doom in this pinched wrinkle of rock  --  or would but for what lay ahead . He could n't see far enough , to the upcoming or downgoing of sun or the touch of sky against the lip of the earth . Closed in , he was , like a prisoner , his eye balked and his feet stopped by walls . Ewing reached for papers and tobacco , rolled a cigarette , struck a match and waited for the sulfur to burn out of itp150before lighting up . The smoke he puffed would add to the total just about as much as one drop would add to a bucket of water . One foot was a little stiff . He straightened his leg and moved the toes in his boot . Too much strolling around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down for a beer or two and joined three old codgers in a few games of solo . Helena was n't such a grand town , even with the capitol building it boasted about . All gold camps tended to peter out sooner or later and mostly sooner . Bannock , Virginia City , Confederate Gulch , Gold Butte  --  what were they now ? Gold did n't breed like cattle or sheep and could n't be seeded like oats . Wash it out , dig it out , make a splurge and be off , leaving the worked gravel and holes in the ground to show what was n't there anymore and never would be again . Copper was different , though taking any part out meant the less there was left and , in the long run , none left at all . But the city of Butte had a whole mountain of it , a hill reckoned everlasting or at least thereabouts . Dig it , boys . He dropped his dead cigarette on the floor . It seemed a long time ago he had come to Montana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by thoughts that wandered to ghost towns and gutted gulches and what was being called conservation and to copper wars and to Helena and how it came to be capital . A big fight , that , between Anaconda and Helena , and millions spent by the opposing high cockalorums of copper , and men bought and sold  --  and for what ? So one town or the other could have a State House and play host to legislative windjammerswho ended up doing what copper demanded , its voice being single since the high cockalorums had sold out to the trust , to the Anaconda Copper Mining Company . Ewing consulted his watch . Barring delay , it was time thep151train got there . From the window the late twilight looked smoky , as if from the output of what would be lumber plants . tie saw lights . The train slackened speed , its wheels clicking the slow and slower beat of arrival . From the end of the coach the conductor called , " Missoula , Missoula . This way . " He rose and stretched and took hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have called it  --  and edged into line . The air outside was different but hardly better than that inside . It carried a definite whiff of stink , a mixed odor that suggested chickens and pigs and  --  not so bad  --  horses . Sideby-sideplanks led to the station , put there , he supposed , against the chances of wet weather and mud . Walking , he heard the groan of a pig changing bedtime position . For an instant the sound took him back to Kentucky . He jostled through the station and opened the door , and the shouts of hotel hackmen beset his ears . " Hotel Shapard . " " Right here for the Missoula Hotel . " " Savoy Hotel . All modern conveniences . " Their turnouts stood ranked along the sides of the station . Then , frail but clear above them , came a voice he would n't forget . " Mr. Ewing ! Mort ! Mort ! " With a swirl of skirts she came rushing to him . " Oh , Mort , " she said , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She looked in his face , her eyes wide and glad under a flat , funny straw hat he would have called a boater ; and he remembered that once he had thought Disenchantment a sire in her pedigree . " I 'm so happy you came . " " Course I came , Julie , but I telegraphed you not to meet me . " I ca n't read . " A man had come up , a youngster with a foolish cap that decorated the back of his head like the crest of a woodpecker.  |p152He  stood quietly by , and then Julie , slow to see him , dropped her hands and turned and said , " Mort , this is my friend Rex Emmett . Mr. Ewing , Rex . " The young fellow plucked off his crest and shook hands . " I 've heard a great deal about you , Mr. Ewing . " " Pleased to meet you . " Julie said , " Rex was good enough to come with me . " " Good . Fine . " He hesitated just for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do is hole up . Looks like a hotel over yonder . " He picked up his war bag . " No , " Julie said . " Not over there . I 've spoken for a room for you at the Florence House . That 's where you 're to stay . " " All right , Lieutenant , even if you do n't get your commissionuntil tomorrow . " " We have a carriage , " the woodpecker said . " Here , sir , let me have your valise . " Ewing thought of protesting . Christ , did he look so old he could n't tote a poke ? He let the young fellow take it . The carriage was a two-horse , closed-in rig with a driver 's seat perched outside at the front . Its sidelights outlined the dismounted driver , who took Ewing 's bag and turned to stow it away . " Rex , " Julie asked , " would you mind sitting up with the driver ? " Before Ewing could say he would sit there himself , Rex answered , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As the cab started to roll , Julie moved closer and whispered , " He 's a good boy , Mort . " " Seems like . " " He 's graduating , too . " Ewing waited for what was to come . Waiting , he reminded himself that long expectation went mute at reunion . Always there was too much to say , too much remembered , too muchp153in changes in person and upshot , and so nothing was said , At last he asked , " Yes , Julie ? " She was a moment in answering . " The Adlams sent me a purse , a lovely one , and such a good letter . " Her voice sounded far away . " And Eva mailed me a bracelet . How is she , Mort ? " " As to that , " he said , " I do n't know . Been a long , long time . Downhill , they say . " She said in his ear , " A long , long time , " and there was a catch in her voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , and he held it while he thought of the time she was . thinking of , too . Who said Disenchantment was not of her blood ? He put her hand aside . " Sun 's up for you , Julie , so buck up . What 's a degree for ? The desponds ? " Now she could laugh a trembling laugh . " You 're a dear , Mort . You always were . I wonder how ever I ever can pay you ? " " You have , so do n't try . " The rig pulled up in front of the hotel . " I have to get back , " Julie said . " Rex will see me home . Now you have it straight , Mort ? Main Hall at two-thirty o'clock . I 'll see you . right afterward . " She pecked him good-bye . " Sure . Sure . " He stepped down to the street . " Night , Julie . " Rex had taken his bag and was striding ahead . At the desk in the lobby two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The boy put down the bag . " It wo n't be a minute , sir , " he . said . So this , Ewing thought , looking , was the new way to dress . up . Turn up your pants at least half a handspan so 's to harvesta good crop of hayseeds . Wear peg-top trousers , which were n't pegs but flares and made a man look like a squawp154spread by many a birthing . Have wide lapels , low cut in order to be able to jump through the collar if a rope got under your tail . The boy said with that pitiful , that right , earnestness as they moved toward the desk , " She 's a wonderful girl , Mr. Ewing , if you 'll allow me to say so . " He had a good face and a body that looked to be strong , no matter the way he decked it out . " Top cut , " Ewing answered . They shook hands good-bye , and Ewing put his name on the register . " A nice room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In a minute there 'll be a bellboy to help you . " " Never mind , " Ewing answered . " I 'll make it myself . " His bag was n't so goddam heavy.  |p155LIE  WAKENED EARLY and stretched and looked at the ceiling from which an electric lamp hung . Lighted , it would look like a hairpin burning in a bottle , as some graphophone joker  --  yeah , Uncle Josh  --  had cracked wise . A rancher , a busted-down trail hand , always got the wide eye at sunup or earlier , while men who decorated their vests with gold chains and their heads with hard hats slept their paper-work sleep . One of the hands at the ranch would be milking already , and Mrs. McDonald likely feeding the chickensor readying flannel cakes for the men 's breakfast . Nice day for it , it seemed , if ever there was a nice day for milking . When canned milk had come out , some cowpuncher galoot had written in praise of it : No tits to pull . No hay to pitch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He yawned , wishing he could catch a wink or two more , and rolled up in bed and reached for tobacco and papers . The room , with the first sun beaming in , seemed almighty hot . That was the way of town  --  the sick heat  --  and a man whop156knew weather first-hand felt a fever . Better a hot wind and a scorcher of sun than this walled-in and dead insolation . The cigarette tasted like mold . He went to the bathroom and flushed it away . No doubt here was an improvement , the patent toilet , but it took something away from the pleasure of a man 's morning chore . No buzzing of bees . No visits of curiouschipmunks . No rustle of breeze . No idle fingering through last year 's Sears Roebuck catalogue , if it lasted that long . He was out of date all right . Mr. Darwin 's evolution was bringing out a fartless new breed , and the hell with the old save maybe a few , preserved to show what ancestors looked like . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But his ass to these dismals . When a man thought low , he was low sure enough . When he got to looking back , dreading the downhill , the goddam grave sneaked up on him . Safe in the arms of Jesus . He bathed and shaved . In the mirror he had to grin at himself , inside and out . The weather had put seams in his face , and he had put a few in on his own and did n't regret the occasions . As the years added up , a man did n't feel bad so much about what he 'd done as about what he 'd missed . Now , beforelong , those squinched eyes of his that had seen many a thing would see Julie graduate . Who said there was nothing new under the sun ? He should have hung his clothes up last night . They showed some wrinkles as he took them out of the bag . But the suit was a new one and , to boot , no Monkey Ward bargain . If the pants did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had forgotten to dock them a handspan , if the coat collar was snug enough to keep him from jumping clean through it if anyone goosed him , if the britches did n't flare so 's to make him six ax handles across , then that was that . His hat , a low/crowned Stetson , would do . What tormented him was a tie . At last , good enough . Now out on the town . He could hear it coming to life . At a counter he ordered coffee , sausages and a short stack . The hot cakes were heavier than Mrs. McDonald 's . He paid up and moseyed onto the street . First thing a man did in strange settings was to see just how he was set . From this side of the main road it looked like the settlement was sunk in a bowl . He crossed over so as to see what the buildings in back of him hid . Here was a bowl all right , open only to birds . Reaching for distance , the eye bumped up against mountains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so they did n't crowd in on him . The town would n't let the stranger forget where he was , he thought while he idled along , careless of where his feet took him . Every sign , every firm name , had " Missoula " in it and once in a while " Garden City . " And there were plenty of outfits  --  saloons called wine houses , restaurants , drugstores , generalmercantiles , abstract offices , sheet-metal jobbers , Chinese laundries , stationery and wallpaper firms , hotels and more than enough real-estate joints . Professions like banking and law did n't lack nomination . He paused in front of one of the real-estate offices . The door was open , and a man at a desk was gesturing at another as if offering all the best of Montana . From somewhere inside a third man came out and said , " Howdy , friend . Wo n't you come in ? " " I 'm just lookin ' around . " " You 're interested in land , perhaps ? " The man was halfbaldand had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I am . " " Then let me tell you . You should dismiss the mistaken idea of taking up a vast tract of land , if that 's in your mind.  |p158Peo|ple  out here are making a comfortable living and saving some money on a five-acre tract , raising fruit and chickens . Ten acres will insure a handsome income . " " Sure enough ? " " Sure enough . Now I have any number of places for sale , priced from two-fifty to five dollars an acre . They are all excellentbuys , but I would recommend the latter . " " Fruits and berries , huh ? " " Just name it and grow it . " " And chickens ? " " A profitable enterprise . An easy one . And here 's another thing , friend . Hard work is for young men . Not that you 're not in the prime of life , as you plainly are , but all of us as we get older like to let up a bit . " " I was thinkin ' on that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  which means stoopin ' , and tree fruits grow high , which means stretchin ' . You got a place where a man can just set and grow rich without lookin ' for eggs ? " The man 's expression turned queer . " You said you were interested in land . " " Yep . I own a ranch . " The man turned and marched back in the office . A little crowd had gathered up the street . Ewing lagged to it . What had centered them there was a contraption that any team of his would have run ass-over-teakettle away from , a contraption sometimes called in sneer or praise a horseless carriage . It looked bulgy and awkward , as the one or two he had seen always did . It was a poor-built box with a tarp for a top . Apparently the salesman , standing alongside , had thrown out his bait and was waiting for bites . Now he turned to Ewing and made a fresh cast . " Look it over , mister . Look it over good . Best autobuggy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jingo , that 's that she is , a full six-cylinder Winton.  |p159Takes  you there and brings you back . Would you believe I came all the way from Hamilton this A.M. and never a hitch ? " " So ? " " A good fifty miles and roads not the best , by jingo . How long by horse , saddle or harness , I ask you ? How long ? By the looks of you , you know horses . Mister , are n't you tired of saddlingup and hooking up and watching grass grow up under hoof ? Are n't you tired of old Dobbin ? " " Not dead tired yet . " The salesman addressed all of his audience . " Get in , two , three , four of you , and we 'll make a sashay . That 's right . Make yourselves comfortable . " When three men were seated , the salesman went to crank up . He gave the engine a couple of quarter-turn jerks and then bent to his work and spun it around . But the best autobuggyin the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ewing saw generations of men , lopsided from wrestling cranks . All old Dobbin needed was , " Giddap ! " He had a drink  --  two might smell on his breath  --  and took his time over a midday meal at a place called Ye Olde Inn , which tried to look new . Lazing around afterward , he halted in front of a posy house and thought about buying Julie some flowers . In former days , in cow towns large enough for theaters , he might have sent a big bouquet on stage for some actress he happened to admire ; but that caper did n't seem the ticket now . He could see himself seated in brainy , solemn company , holding the cut flowers , carnations sprouting from his bellybutton , until the last amen . The main street was coming to be busy . Along it , together and at intervals , rolled-top buggies , surreys , buckboards , bicycles , hacks and even a work wagon , all bound south . On the sidewalks groups and couples and now and then a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was pulled up in front of the Florence , its driver dismounted and watchful for customers . He had a mustache like a boot brush . " Graduation ? " Ewing asked . " Sure thing . Climb in . " By and by the rig rolled across the bridge over Clark 's Fork , the river which he had heard miscalled the Missoula . That was the way of things , Captains Lewis and Clark . Explore a whole world of wilderness , and in a hundred years maybe your names could be found in the graveyard . They turned to the left from the main road , and the smell of flowers , likely lilacs , drifted into the cab . Looking out , Ewing saw showy houses , some made of brick , and yards tidied and planted , and early summer in bloom . The season , he reckoned , was maybe a month ahead of Arfive , where the leaves of willows and cottonwoods still were young green . The driver whoaed up and got down and opened the door . " Here you are , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you wait till it 's over ? " " No , sir . Not here . Not on the oval . " Ewing gazed around . The road made a loop , touching close to three buildings , and nowhere along it was there a hitch rack . " Hell of a note , " he said . " A little horse manure never hurt anybody . " The driver smiled under the brush of his lip . " You 're right , old-timer . But it 's bullshit they pitch around here . " Ewing handed over two dollars . " Well , thanks and thanks again , " the driver said . " Tell you what . S'pose I show up in an hour , anyhow in plenty of time ? " " Good . Be in front of Woman 's Hall , will you ? And , say , how about a bigger buggy ? There 'll be some plunder . " The driver answered , " No trouble , " and climbed to his seat and wheeled off.  |p161At  the top of what he took to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . The clock said 2:17 . Too early to enter . He moved around idly , taking things in . Yonder , with the side and front porches , probably was Woman 's Hall , where Julie stayed , having said nix to the little hen 's clubs called sororities . They cost money , she had written , though never had he played pinchpenny . He stepped off the sidewalk to let people pass . The grounds were well kept and maybe new-manicured for the occasion . The mowed grass led along to young and shaped shade trees , to a whole scattered batch of them , where young folks could have lolled in the night . But this ordered management of blade and leaf and shrub and walkway was n't for him . Kept grounds were men 's doing , as little and artificial as dollhouses . Give him a reach of raw land . Give him a tumbleweed . The passers-by had thinned down almost to nothing . The tower clock said he was three minutes late . He walked up the hall steps , removed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an usher and chose a back seat from which he could see . Some opening music , mournful enough for a funeral , was fading out , and the seniors in caps and gowns were taking chairs on the stage . Julie was in the front row . After the music ended , a preacher got up and came to the front of the platform and took God 's own time in making sure God would guide the feet of those about to be turned loose in the world . A woman sang a song then , giving both lungs to it ; and Ewing , half listening , ran his gaze over the graduates . The boy , Rex What's-His-Name , sat stiff at one end of the back row . Maybe the academic sky-piece was an improvement over his peckerwood cap . From what he could see of them , the girls wore full , pleated dark dresses that reached to their shoes and ruffled white blouses high in the neck . Except for Julie , they wore pins at their throats . She wore a little , more/fetching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but slid off enough to count twenty or more on the stage . The program divided them into four groups . Julie was Literary . The president stalked to the stand and ruffled his papers . After hemming and hawing a little , he lined himself out . His subject , the program said , was " Twentieth-Century Education . " By virtue of learning , he assured all , these young people would make a better stab at things than people before had . They had the education and the youth and the will . Improvementwas sure . The future shone . While the president kept circling the same track , Julie listened , or seemed to do so . Her expression was grave but alive . Her small hands lay clasped in her lap . Attentive or not , she surely did shine . Better she did n't know his cowpuncher and common assessments of show . Better he shone for her . After the headman had dried up , another woman sang anothersong ; and then , one by one , the graduates filed by and received their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in the back row . Anyhow , unlike the others , she turned and for a little instant held up the paper . For the wind-up a third woman had to sing and the preacher to chew again on God 's ear . Julie came pushing through the crowd . She hugged him . " Why did you sit so far back ? " " No seats outside . " " Oh , Mort , at last ! " " Why , sure , girl . " She leaned closer and whispered , " I know it was dull as dirt for you  --  but , Mort , not for me . " " I savvy . A new world . " As they moved out , he told her , " I 've got a turnout waiting . " " My things are all packed and ready downstairs . " A voice called , " Julie ! Julie ! " and Rex hurried to her . " Your cap and gown . I 'll take care of them . Pardon me andp163good afternoon , Mr. Ewing . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must meet the preceptress , " Julie said as they went on . " Come again . " " How 's proctor then ? " " Closer to the reservation . " Before they reached Woman 's Hall , in front of which variouscarriages waited , including the bigger one he had asked for , Rex came trotting back . " I 'll see that you 're loaded . " Girls swirled at the entrance to the dormitory , meeting and coming and going and telling parents and well-wishers to wait just a minute . All of them seemed to know Julie . They said congratulations and hello and good-bye in the tender , overblown , blossomy way of young females . It was as if , just petaledout , they had tears about winter already . Julie led him and Rex into a parlor , cluttered with the plunderof everyone 's going . He did n't get the name of the preceptress , if that 's what she was . She looked old and staid and indulgent and , while Julie listened , said to him , " Your girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along . I hate to see Julie go . " tier eyes went wet . " There 's my luggage , Rex , " Julie said , pointing . " I 'll go to my room for a last look around . " " Where is your cab , Mr. Ewing ? " the young fellow asked . " No . No . Do n't you trouble yourself with the loading . It will take me only a jiffy . " Empty-handed , Ewing went to the doorway and indicated his carriage and stepped back inside and waited for Julie . She returned and hugged the old woman , and for a moment both of them cried . Then , holding his arm , she took him out . Rex stood with the driver . " Good-bye , Mr. Ewing , " he said first , extending his hand . " A great pleasure to meet you . And good-bye , Julie . Good-bye . I hope to see you this summer . "  | " Yes . Yes , " Julie answered , and gave him a kiss that left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , " the driver said , combing his mustache at sight of Julie . " Hop in , you and the little miss . " Ewing saw Julie up and climbed in himself . As the rig rolled , she took his hand and looked in his eyes , and a little quirk , maybe sad , came on her face . " Home , old-timer , " she said.  | " MOTHER , " Mary Jess said , " some of the girls are going to meet at Smith 's Ice Cream Parlor . Is it all right if I go ? " May Collingsworth looked up from her ironing . " Why , I think so . Just you girls , is it ? " She smiled into the fair and innocent , the dutiful , face . " You 'll need a nickel or two . " She found her purse on the sewing machine and took a dime from it , leaving five cents  --  for seed if ever it sprouted . Mary Jess went out happily , not letting the door slam , and May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street . Let her never be hurt , she asked . Let her never be hurt more than she has been . Tommie 's death and the baby 's were hurt enough . The child was so lovely , so lovely and vulnerable , so young to have deaths ever cloud the calm trust of her eyes . So young at eleven to bow to God 's mercy . So young , though the virgin breasts were swelling her middy blouse , to have learned anything about the nature of boys . It had been two weeks ago or about , and at dusk Mary Jess had run into the house frightened and crying and buried her face against May and finally between sobs  --  and almost as if the shame were her own  --  had told her and Benton that Wallace Marsh had proposed she lift her skirt and open her union suit.  |p166Benton  heard her out without comment or question and then walked to the rack and put on his hat , his face like a casting . May ran to him . She caught hold of his arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " The whelp ! " He tried to shake off her hand . " What good would it do ? Whatever good ? " " I 'll teach him . " " And have it known ? Have it known everywhere ? EmbarrassMary Jess ? " Mary Jess cried from the parlor , " Please , Father . " Benton hesitated . " I 'll see his father then . I 'll talk to Mere Marsh . " " Maybe , Benton . Maybe sometime . But what can you expectfrom him ? He might try to turn it against you , against us . Do n't you see ? And no harm 's been done . No real harm . " Finally she had managed to calm him , though her logic had been weak , it seemed to her now . What really had scared her , what had made her protest , was what Benton might do . May closed the door and stood thinking , letting the ironing wait . To a young girl what could be said about sex except that she close her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? What could a mother say ? Not the truth surely , lest it inflame the beginning desire and hasten experiment . Love could n't be taught . It had to be experienced and repeated underproper circumstances with the right man . It was unfortunate , it was less than right , it was a tarnish of eventual truth to apply the word " nasty " to all acts of young curiosity . But where was a better , more discouraging word ? She went back to the ironing board . Lately , she thought , her chores took a ridiculous toll of her strength . More and more she had been scanting the dusting and sweeping , the immediate tasks seemed so many and heavy . She couldn'tp167plead pregnancy , either , not since last summer 's miscarriage . Four pregnancies , three children born live , one of them living . Now barrenness ? It could n't and should n't be . Just as she finished doing up one of Benton 's white shirts , there came a knock at the door . Mrs. Ross stood outside and came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precision . As always , she was carefullydressed . It was , May thought , as if some compulsion kept her immaculate , as if all of her , saving her face , had to be shielded and herself confirmed by outward appearance , like a priest in his vestments . Even now she wore a heavy veil . " I 'm so glad you came , " May said , aware without embarrassment of her own worn and untidy dress . " Please , let me take your things , and you go in and have a chair . " With a sort of slow purpose Mrs. Ross removed her gloves , then her hat and veil , and handed them over along with her purse . From the clothes closet May called into the parlor , " Excuse me just a minute . I 'll put some coffee on . " Mrs. Ross was seated when she returned . She took the old rocker nearby . " It 's so nice to have company . So nice it 's you . " " Thank you , " Mrs. Ross said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house of peace . " The fretwork of weather on the sad face had deepened and extended with years ; but now , May saw for the first time , little twitches disturbed it , small , nervous eddies like the touches of wind on water . Her eyes looked unfocused and empty of thought . " I needed someone to talk to , " May said . " Benton 's gone , you know . " " Oh , I thought he was helping out at the county treasurer 's office . " Mrs. Ross spoke as if Benton 's whereabouts touched her hardly at all.  | " He was , but school will start soon , so he hitched up the horse and went to the mountains to fish for a day or so . Sometimeshe likes to be alone . I ca n't say that I do . " Still in a faraway voice , in a voice , May thought , as frail as a breath , Mrs. Ross said , " Forlorn . Ever since the girls left for college , the ranch is forlorn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost everything before . They keep coming back , what I 've said . " May waited . Mrs. Ross 's gaze was n't on her . It was n't on anything to be seen . " Everyone 's that way , I guess . " She tried to speak lightly . " It does n't matter . Today 's such a nice day . " " I suppose so . " " And you 're looking quite well , Mrs. Ross . " " Oh , yes . Ask Jay . Finer than frog hair , he would tell you . " How is he ? " " I do n't inquire . " Into the eyes had come the look of haunt , of joys or nightmares remembered , the look more than ever of severance from here and now . May excused herself and poured coffee , spilling some , and brought it and napkins in on a tray . " I remembered you took it black . I find coffee just the thing when I 'm at low ebb . " Mrs. Ross did n't answer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the back of it veins ran a pale tracery . Abruptly she said , stronger voiced , " I 'm all right , Mrs. Collingsworth , righter than I 've been in a long time , so do n't fret yourself . Things are n't going to bother me anymore , not the sky and not even the wind . " May could think of no better reply than , " One does get used to it . " " Or away from it , my dear . I could never get used to the sky here . It is bottomless and without end in any direction , and I feel so  --  so flung out , I guess you could say , so bare andp169so scattered . It 's like a jail without walls but with peepholes in it , or one giant peephole . " The voice had gone weak again at the end . It was remindful of a sigh over forgotten regrets . " Are you sure you 're all right , Mrs. Ross ? " Mrs. Ross might not have heard . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she went on . " It marches , you know , always marches or charges . You can hear it before it arrives . It gathersstrength on the far butte from the ranch house and then howls along like an invader , like a troop of them . " " It 's good you 've decided to pay no attention . More coffee ? " " If it is n't men marching , it 's horses charging . They 're all of them stallions . " It seemed to May , hearing and watching this thin , troubled woman , this woman too soon grown old , that the wind had dried up all her juices , leaving a dead reed of a body , a papery voice and an erratic mind . " Stallions ? " she said without purpose . " Always stallions . Jay likes to watch them , you know , when  --  " She did n't finish , having come as close to the fact as any lady should come . It occurred to May of a sudden that perhaps it was n't altogetherthe wind and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be dried . And men did n't invade or stallions charge unless fear or distaste populated the winds . Poor woman , she thought , and , yes , even poor Jay , who by her guess  --  and by whispered report  --  had more than enough appetite . Poor both of them . " We had a name in upper New York , " Mrs. Ross was saying . " We still have . My family . " " Why , you have a name here ! " Mrs. Ross was a long time in answering . " Yes , " she said finally . " Yes  --  Jay has . " She got up with her frail , dry dignity . " I must go now . Thank you for the coffee . " Carefully she put on the hat and veil May brought her , care/fully her gloves . At the door she said , " Good-bye , Mrs. Collingsworth . God bless you . Good-bye . I 'm leaving tomorrow . " " Leaving ! For good ! " Mrs. Ross turned away as if not wanting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For home . The girls will join me . " " I 'm so sorry . Oh , Mrs. Ross , I 'll miss you . Good-bye . " With nice , old precision , without looking back , Mrs. Ross went down the walk.  |p171HERE  AT THE MOUTH of the canyon the Breast River washed gravel already shining . It ran from bend to bend and at the bends tarried , green-blue and inviting in the late-afternoon light . Its surface caught the colors of sunset . Collingsworth hitched the home-fashioned creel on his shoulder and walked on toward a turn , casting his artificial lure idly in the shallows where no trout were likely to lie . One more hole , he thought , and he would have plenty of fish , not alone for himself but for old Charlie Blackman and his companion . He had met Charlie upstream on the shore , standing gawky as a blue heron . He held an open-topped , five-gallon kerosene can with a haywire handle . " How , Perfessor ? " he had said , grinning . " Hello @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Me and my pardner is gophering up there on the ridge . " He thumbed back toward the place with his free hand . " Might get jackass lucky . Gold 's where you find it , ai n't that the sayin ' ? " " Gold , for heaven 's sake ! " " Yep , but it 's dry work . For wettin ' our whistles we got to come to the crick . How 's fishin ' , Perfessor ? " " Good , so far . I 'll bring you a mess if you want it . "  |p172Blackman  pushed his can in the creek , filled it and lifted it with an ease surprising in so old a man . " Any day but Friday , which today ai n't . " Blackman grinned again , showing some teeth . " I got scruples against fish on Friday . " Collingsworth had said good-bye and walked on . When he looked back , he saw Blackman lugging the full can up the hill . There was no hurry . He sat down on a dead log @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and over it the shapes and colors of sundown , plain then distortedby the fancies of water . Like men , water had to go somewhere , yet the stream would remain , new water introducingitself to old rocks , old driftwood , old twists and turns and quarreling and chuckling to itself at discovery . Old discoveriescould n't be reported upstream . He saw the old horse again , stirred to the thought of it , he realized , by one of those frail and distracting connections that too often made thinking random . It had trotted out , sway-backed and big-headed , from the shade of old Sorenson 's deserted homesteader shack as he was about to pass in his buggy . The shack was of tarpaper , now mostly blown off . Its two windows were blank , glass and frames taken by someone with use for them . Whatever there had been in the way of a barn had been torn down for firewood or planking . The old horse remained . Collingsworth imagined he knew what had happened . The Sorensons had packed up and moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking the few animals still of use or of value . But there was Old Buck or Old Blue or Old Bess , too old for service , too dear for death . And so they had left it . The horse had followed along for a mile , its heavy feet lifting slower and slower , and then had stopped and turned back and plodded home.  |p173From  somewhere now crows were yelling against the turn of the day , a nutcracker scratched the air and , close at hand , a water ouzel , fresh as creation , tried current and stone and seemed pleased with both as well as itself . Out of water , from fish to bird . Elephant Ear Butte was shaded save at its very top , where the sun said good-bye to it or promised return . It stood lonely and eternal , itself a promise of constancy , sunrise or not , storm , time and tide or not . A man felt drawn to it , felt embracedby a flowing foreverness , felt mortal and reassured . Dying , he would know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down toward the hole , thrashing through a thicket of willows that caught at his line and rod . From the ground came the smell of mashed leaves , the nostril-pinchof bruised peppermint . Careful lest he muddy the water or be glimpsed by the fish , he approached the hole and whipped out his fly and guided it , fluttering , to a blue eddy . The fly was a new one to him , a Silver Doctor , by name a fittingcompanion to the Grizzly King , the King and Queen of Waters , the Royal Coachman . It answered , silver and live , to the light rein of the rod . But , strangely , here was no strike , not even the quick glimmerof a trout tempted but wary , and he let the current carry the lure around a shouldering bank and so out of sight . It was when he was reeling in that the fish struck . He set the hook , and the rod arched and quivered , and the line ran through his fingers to the shrill of the reel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and work his tackle in quieter waters and presently bring the fish to the shallows . It lay quiet there , its gills laboring . He lowered the rod to the slant of the line and , running back , yanked it ashore . Now there , he thought , for an instant watching its spasms ,  |p174was  a fish . There was a cutthroat such as seldom was seen . Three pounds at least , maybe four . No wonder no other strikes . Big fish devoured or chased away smaller ones . He got out his knife and caught the trout by its gills . It ceased flapping the minute the blade cut through its backbone . He held it up after he had removed the Silver Doctor . Red streaked its jaws , and red washed its lower sides , and from its back and upper sides the pupiled speckles stared out . It was too big to lie whole in a frypan . He gutted all his catch and made for camp . Camp was a tarpaulin slanted down from a rope and shone white in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stones and a pot and a pan and some small provisions tied in a sack that he had drawn part way up on a limb against the possibility of packrats and porcupines and just possibly bears . Off just a piece was his buggy . His horse whinnied from the patch of grass in which he had staked it . He went to it , saying , " Whoa , old boy . Whoa , Fox . " The horse always disliked the smell of fish or of game , and now , snorting , kicked at him . But his luck had been too good for bad temper . He quieted it and led it to water and found fresh grass for a picket ground . He changed into dry clothes and afterward fried out some bacon , put half a dozen fish in the grease and set coffee to boil . Bacon and fish and May 's special bread . Not fancy fare but fit for a king . With coffee he permitted himself a pipe of tobacco . It tasted better , perhaps , because he should n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred and seventy-five dollars a month , not with so many family needs , not after the illnesses and deaths that had visited them . He supposed he ought to be earning more . There were other professions and places . But he had tried reading law and found it so dull that when he came to the study of torts he had pitched the book to one side , never to crack it again.  |p175Other  places ? He had had offers , two of them , and had rejectedboth . The second one was the better  --  much better in promise and pay than ever could be hoped for from Arfive . When he had announced his decision , May had looked up from her sewing . There might have been accusation in her eyes . " You do n't agree , " he said . " I know your capabilities , Benton . Do you ? " " I know I do n't want to go to a city . I do n't want to have to contend with a lot of young foreign hoodlums . " " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold both agreement and contradiction . " It 's not that I 'm afraid , confound it ! Do n't ever think that ! " May had looked back down on her sewing . Dark was drawing on , and the first stars appearing . He knocked out his pipe and brought himself up and , turning , saw a glow on the ridge where Charlie Blackman was camping . He could wait till tomorrow , he thought , to deliver the fish . He could turn in if he felt like it . He took the creel to the stream and there stripped off some willow leaves and put them inside to keep the trout fresh . Then he doused the creel and turned and set out . The darkenedway was uncertain at first , but soon he discovered a winding game trail  --  made by what and how many animals in what long ago ?  --  and followed it up . " Hello , the fire , " he shouted when he was close enough , recallingthat at night in southern Indiana a visitor helloed a rural house lest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self , " Blackman yelled back . " Sing out the countersign . " " Heap fish . " " Leave the fish come ahead . " Blackman sat like a stick , like an assembly of sticks , at thep176side of his little fire . Near him , propped by an elbow , lounged a stranger to Collingsworth . " Perfessor , here 's my sidekick , name of Smoky Moreau . Smoky , shake hands with what I would call a goddam good man if he was n't around . " As if in an aside to his sidekick he added , " The perfessor ai n't stuck on cussin ' . " The man had risen to shake hands . He was younger than Charlie by perhaps fifteen years , and his face in the firelight showed swarthy . It seemed so open and guileless as to affirm the myth of the noble native . As they shook , Moreau said , " Comment portez-vous ? " " he means how be ye , " Blackman explained . " He can speak the lingo pret ' near as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his nerves . " " Fine , thanks , " Collingsworth answered . He put down the creel and sat on the ground , watching Blackman nose sticks deeper into the fire . Farther on was a sheep wagon with a torn canvas cover and , beyond it , a knoll with the mouth of a hole in it and scattered boulders alongside . " How 's the mining ? " he asked . " Leave me look at the fish . " Blackman hinged up from his squat , went to the creel and dumped fish and leaves in a battered basin . One by one he lifted and examined the catch . When he came to the big trout , he said , " Now that ai n't exactly a peedad . More like a wowser . Me and Smoky sure thank you . " He sat down . " We was runnin ' pretty low in the feed sack . Think on it , Smoky . The perfessor , he 's spelled us from sow belly and poop fruit . Course , " he went on for Collingsworth 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fool hen , but they 's hard to find when you set yourself to it . That 's how it is . Do n't look for a thing , and it 's underfoot . Look for it , and it 's hell-and-gone gone . Ever notice ? " " Yes . How 's the mining ? "  | " Now as to that , it 's hard to say . ' We got a fair show in the first place , enough to keep our hands on the shovel . Had it assayed and all . Lately not so good . " " Kill ourselves , no , " Moreau said . " Feel like work , all right . Feel not so , fine . We live . " " Likely nature 's just baitin ' us . " Blackman shifted his old haunches . " But , long as our stake holds out , it 's somep'n to do and nice place to do it . Beats hell out of the poor farm . Y'ever been there ? " " Once , " Collingsworth said , remembering . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them old farts as ca n't open their eyes or shut off their bowels . Come winter , I 'll catch a few furs and later go back to swampin ' saloons . No poor farm . " " Charlie , he never runs out of talk , " Moreau put in . " Most old people deef . That would scald him . " " A man gets to talkin ' just because he 's got nothin ' to say , " Blackman replied , unoffended . " And , like us , only Smoky ca n't read , he 'll read whatever comes to his eye . And , speakin ' of labels , I just learnt by heart one that come on a box that held somep'n called Force . What it was was corn or oats or wheat smashed flat as a mouse turd in a sheep wagon . Underneath the picture of a high-flyin ' scarecrow was the pome . Vigor , vim , Perfect trim . Force makes himSunny Jim. " ' ' he horses et it , not hearty . " Moreau got out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a twig to the fire and used it as a match . " The Indians told stories . Big stories . " " Yes ? " Collingsworth asked  | " Nothing more to tell , they told stories . The Indians . " Blackman considered , then said abruptly , " Oh , sure , Smoky . I savvy . Perfessor , you 're bound to have a yarn or twoup your sleeve . " " Oh , no . Thanks . I have n't . " " All that readin ' , and no crop a'tall ? " " Children 's stories . Fairy tales I tell my daughter , orused to when she was smaller . That 's all . Anyhow , it 's timeto bed down . " " So what 's wrong ? " Blackman asked . Moreau 's open facewaited . " I listened many a time to Injun stories , some here by Smoky , and how the coyote could outslick any brute or brave , bein ' able to change shapes and talk whatever tongue suitedhim . " " He was a smart one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The old horse at the deserted homestead came to mind andwith it " The Bremen Town Musicians . " Mary Jess had liked the story , perhaps in part because he did himself . But these grown men ? " It 's so childish , " he said . " So 's Mr. Coyote . Speak up , Perfessor . " He started uneasily , not sure of memory , much less of audience . " A farmer once had a faithful ass  --  " He had apprehendeda snicker here . What he got was attention . He went on , gaining confidence , gaining the voice that public appearancesoften subdued , encouraged by the absence of interruptionor fidget . He told of the old ass and the hound and the cat and the cock and the rout of the robbers and ended with that disarming ending : " And the mouth of him who last toldthis story is still warm . " For a minute they were silent . Then Blackman said , " I saidso , Smoky . " " Yes . " " We 're a couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ass or the hound or the cat . Too old but not so . " Collingsworth got up , and , as if suddenly aware of his presence , they got up , too . " I must be going , " he said . Blackman came to him and held out his hand . " Come again , any time , fish or no fish . " " But have the warm mouth , " Moreau said , taking his hand . Away from the fire the stars fired up , and one , falling , flared its good-bye and left the congregation no poorer . Simple stories , conceits , language , logic , history , formulas  --  they were all fairy tales , images and symbols , acquisitions and wisdoms that the fanciful and exploring mind had conjuredand explicated . Not fairy tales , though . Wonders . Rich wonders . And hungry old men would listen . He saw again to his horse and sat on a downed log by his dead fire . He must learn more of the stars , that final wonder of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Pleiades , they and a host of others were shining tonight , all on parade , at attention , close as reach and farther than thought . A night bird cried once , and a coyote sang and another joined in . ElephantEar Butte was still there . The night was in him , and the stars and the mountain , and a shiver , not of his making , ran over him . Afraid or unafraid , who would choose to abandon this land ? Here was his homestead , his point of outlook on heaven and earth , on the world and America . And it was part of his America , part of her riches , part of her essential rightness , part of her stamina and invulnerability . Other peoples had love of their countries , none with more or as much reason as his own fellows . Ile found himself saying aloud what he had memorized as his peroration to a Memorial Sunday address delivered last flay . " And thou , the spirit of my country , thou , our America , our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the noblestp180and most beautiful form that we know . It is our pleasing fancy to think of thee as a woman . Thou art so very fair that thou dost challenge all our admiration . Thou art so virtuous that we reverence thee . Thou art so gentle that we love thee . Thou haste , moreover , the crowning grace of womanhood ; thou art a mother , the mother of us all . We should all pay to thee the fullest measure of our loyalty . But , alas , thou bast those sons who are ignorant , others who are thoughtless , others still who are false , and these would do thee harm . May we who would be accounted worthier raise about thy feet a strong wall of defense as did those , our older brothers , in thy darkest hour , and , emulating them , may we see to it that thou dost retain thy place in the seats of the mighty . " He got up and sang to the listening night in a voice he never really let go in the Methodist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in yon azure deep ... " He went over and pulled his bed out from under the tarp and undressed to his underwear and lay down . As he was about to close his eyes , he thought of May and of home and the end of the stanza . Hide , hide your golden light . She sleeps , my lady sleeps.  |p181THEY  HAD BEEN riding horseback , up the big ditch , along the mown fields , through the grazing cattle , and on up the ridges where Ewing 's horses found good feed in winter . The day was so clear that the eye ran away , ran north , south and east without end and west to the blued backbone of the Rockies . Was distance blue ? Ewing asked himself . Close up , the mountainswere n't . Close up , what hue was the sky ? From a height the town of Arfive came to sight . Men would be drinking there , breathing air that their crowded breath and their tobacco and bodies had fouled . Or they would be talkingprices and prospects and portents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress . And some would be thinking of church and school and manners , countingas an improvement in moral tone the fact that Eva Fox had closed up her whorehouse but not pausing in their satisfaction to wonder how a poor , pestered devil was to find his . Hell , he thought while he and Julie sat quiet in their saddlesand looked , sin was the invention of man . The sky did n't know it , or the beasts and birds of the field . But to man 's credit were other inventions like honesty and honor and cornpassionand courage , and to fall short in these amounted to sin after all . Collingsworth would have said  --  or would he ?  |  --  that the inventions were God working through man . There was the hitch . It struck him that here was a fine , old way to be thinking when a pretty girl , his almost daughter , sat her saddle close by him . Had she been more  --  yes , vivacious  --  maybe his mind would n't need to be advertised , like an animal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been uncommonly silent , the sun on her face clouded by some trouble of spirit . He could n't believe , quite , that she was n't enjoying the outing . She loved to ride , and always she rode astride in a divided skirt , disdaining a ladylike sidesaddle . Seeing her on a horse , a rider would have said she had a good seat . Knowing her , he would have said she rode gay . Today , for a headpiece , she had chosen , of all things , a checkered and cheerful poke bonnet . Yet underneathit was thought , preoccupation or something other than cheer . After supper with the McDonalds they sat in the beamed and fireplaced room that scarcely could be called a parlor , though Julie had given it feminine touches . It was late dusk , and he had lighted the lamps , and around them a few millers fluttered . A damn nuisance , those dusty house-loving moths . " I wish it were brisk enough for a fire , " Julie said . " It 's close enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He got up and struck a match and touched off the laid fire . When it was going well , she said , looking into it , " It 's all here , Mort . " " What ? " " Nothing . Just old stuff like low lights and fire . But where 's the soft music ? " " Like a graphophone racket ? " " Like I dreamt that I dwelt in marble halls . ' " " Who knows but you will ? " " Even there , I would think about here . I would rememberp183so many things , things like now , for instance , and now just swept by . Already it 's a memory . That 's why the now is important , because it never is . " " Whoa up , girl . It slips by you , all right . Say now and , bang , there she goes . But how come you 're thinking so old ? It 's too early for you to count steps to the boneyard . " " It 's less than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young to be sad . " Not for the boneyard ! " He got up and punched at the fire . " For school and the classroom to teach , for Christ sake ! " " I still will remember . " As if he would n't , Ewing thought . What he answered as he turned to his chair was , " It 's not good-bye . It 's not forever . The place will still be here , and the fields and cattle and horses and all . They 'll whet up your memories and add to the tally to boot . " She did n't speak for a minute . " Will you still be here ? Will you be the same ? " " I aim to stick around as long as I can . The point is you got a whole life ahead of you . Now buck up , girl . " " That 's your answer to everything , is n't it ? Buck up ? " " To some things . To this thing for sure . Here you are , dreadin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fun teachingschool . " " I wo n't , Mort . " Her voice was so low that he strained to hear . " I ca n't . " She bowed her head and put her hands to her face . " God sake , Julie . Do n't get the weeps . " Her voice came out choked . " I do n't want to leave . " Here was an old , old story , he supposed , one enacted and reenacted by generations of families and , for lack of a better connection , related always to the doings of birds , to the fledgling and the nest and the trying of wings . Necessity plus regret . The tearful need . Goddam it.  |p184He  found himself saying , " You do n't have to go , Julie . Stay here . You earn your keep , Christ knows . " " I must make some money . I must pay you back . " " You must n't , either . " " For my sake I must . " She rose abruptly , the wet of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rested her head on his knee . His hand went to her hair . He said , " There , now . You 've braved a lot worse . " She turned her face up to his , her eyes wet and eloquent and hurtful to look at . " Mort , I want more of you . Let me share your bed . You 've been so good , and I 'd be happy to . " For an instant he went over her words , making sure he 'd heard right . Then he thrust her head from him and arose and stepped away . " I will be damned ! You 've lost your head if you think to pay me back that way . " " Pay ! Are you blind ? " " To what ? Not to this . Think what I 've done I did just so 's to bed with you ? " " I 'm sorry , Mort . I did n't put it right . I want to marry you . " " Me ? Old enough to be your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like . I ca n't think of one good reason you 'd want to . " " Why do n't you say I 'm after your money ? " " Because I know better , " he answered , feeling the question disarm him . " But , Julie , think on it . There 's young men around , younger and likely a lot better . You ca n't patch up an old stag like me . The years between are too long . " " The difference does n't keep us apart . It brings us together . It brings me to you , I know . " " Yeah . Father and daughter . " " If you were I , you 'd answer bullshit . " He poked at the fire and let the alien and unlikely wordp185soak . Here was a Julie new to him , a Julie not just soft and sweet and filial but also resolute and blunt and desirous . He almost felt glad . She remained on the floor , watching him . " It 's either you , Mort , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take to men , and you know why . " " You 're a poor judge of quality . " " Mort , do n't you love me ? Do n't you ever think of me as a woman ? Have n't you ever wished for me ? " Had he or had n't he ? Not openly , anyway . Not quite consciously , for what conscience he had had forbidden acknowledgment . It was the way of men , it was their rule , and it was their guilt  --  to wish for the shes , the lovely young shes of dream and fact and on occasion to file their allure and their temptation in the closed storage house of the mind . Fathers loved daughters not apart from their sex . " I have n't thought about it , " he answered , " but I know it 's not best for you . " She put an open hand out . " Whatever you say , Mort . I 'll accept it . If it 's no , just forget I was ever so brazen . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love me or not ? " " Goddam it , yes . " Without seeming effort she arose and came to him . She pressed herself against him . He averted his mouth from her kiss , while feeling himself readying for what must not be . Against his throat she said , " I know it 's ridiculous , Mort , but it 's too bad just the same . " " That 's what I 've told you . " " I mean to have at our wedding the people who 've been kindest and most important to me . " " Yeah ? " " Like the Collingsworths and the Adlams and Eva Fox . " " You get crazier and crazier. "  | " Oh , I know we ca n't , but still it 's too bad . And , after all , Eva shut up her house and bought out Soo Son , and lots of decent people go there to eat . " " From bed on to board and up to respectability , huh ? " He had to laugh a little . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ madam . Fancy women do n't change . " Without looking at her , almost before the fool words came out , he knew he 'd made a mistake . She stepped back , and the face that had been alight now looked stricken . " I see , Mort , " she said . " I 'm sorry I spoke . But you 're wrong . " " Hold on ! Crucified Jesus ! I was wrong and I 'm sorry . " He moved to her and took her in his arms and patted her shoulder while she cried against him . " Little Julie , " he said . " Lord , Lord and my clumsy tongue . Ask me , and I 'll say the man never lived good enough for you . " When she had quieted , he told her , " Now go on to your bed , Julie . Think it over . Think on it well . I 'm twice your age or close to it , and a rough old customer , too . For myself I do n't have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you I got to keep in my mind . Now be off , girl . " She left him then , saying only , " Good night . " It did n't surprise him , it was somehow in the right and due nature of things that , wakening later , he saw the gowned shape of her at his bedside . He moved over and threw back the covers.  |p187IT  WAS FALL , or close to it , but not too late for young things  --  calves and jack rabbits half-grown and on a small pond a hatch of wild mallards that could flap their wings but not fly as yet and so were called floppers . Twin antelopes born just this past spring ran away a piece , white-rumped , and turned and stood , their eyes flowing with curiosity . And it seemed to Ewing , riding toward town , that all young things were his , his in a sense never recognized , never kindled or come to full growth till last night . He had mated with all youth and so was younger himself . Gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the habits of mind that increasedthe crust . He was an old fool and a young man who 'd have a young wife and live young and foolish on the sap newly risen . A man saw things different according to happenings . Which was a way of saying that the eye of the beholder did n't always behold . To get down to cases , here was the land with cloud shadows on it , here was the ripened range grass that waved to the breeze , here was the blue of sky and there the ageless blue bone of the Rockies , and the wind carried scents the nose sampled and sampled again but could n't identify . Beauty was an empty , damn-fool word until the damn fool filled it . Until a girl filled it for him.  |p188So  he would take out the marriage license and see the sky pilot , who was young and uncertain and so better than some preachers before him , and he would try to corral the Collingsworthsand the Adlams , leaving Eva Fox out of it , whether grub merchant or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with due ceremony if not in high style , for such was what Julie wished . Right now she was altering a dress that she said would suit the occasion . She would be waiting for him , and so would the not-yet-nuptial couch . He waved to old Mr. McLaine as he passed his house . Mr. McLaine rose from his chair on the porch and signaled for a whoa . Walking down the path with his cane , he said , " I was expecting you , Mort . " " Howdy and why ? " " Looking for you , then . It seems you 're always in the nick of time . Get off your horse and come in , please . " " I got things on my mind , Mr. McLaine . " " None more important than this , I 'll wager . There 's evil afoot . " What could be more important than marriage , Ewing asked himself ? What evil could come before good ? Yet he dismounted , hitched his horse to the fence and followed Mr. McLaine to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Drink ? " " No thanks . I 'm all business . " " I 'll get right down to the subject then . " Mr. McLaine raised his cane and with his closed fist worried his beard . " It 's a devilish thing . The very devil of a thing . " " Now that I been introduced  --  ? " " Yes . Yes . I 'm coming to it . There 's trouble in the school , Mort . Mere Marsh and Nick Brudd are out to get Mr. Col-lingsworth . " " And that makes a surprise party ? " " No , of course . But they have a weapon now . " Mr. Mc/Laine worked again at his beard . " That nice Miss Carson , Margaret Carson . " Ewing waited . " Mr. Collingsworth has always championed her , you know . " " So have we . Why not ? " " It puts him in a bad position , one perhaps fatal to his post as the principal . " Mr. McLaine tapped his cane on the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She is , it would appear , a deviate , a sexual deviate , a pervert , so-called . " " Her ! A bitch man ! A bull diker ! " " I 'm not familiar with your terminology . In Old England they might have called her a faggot . " " Where 's the evidence ? " " Marsh warned me , " Mr. McLaine went on as if he had n't heard the question . " He 's warned Ross , too . They 'll tackle you next , I suppose , he and Brudd , though  --  " here Mr. McLaine'swhite eyebrows lifted and his old eyes studied Ewing "  --  they may be a bit timid about that . " " I doubt it . " " The two are making big medicine . For championing such a woman , Collingsworth has to go . If the board does n't fire him , the matter will be made common knowledge , and the consequent stench will force us to act . That 's the ultima-tum . " " I do n't aim to eat that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just the same , no matter that we 've renewed Collingsworth 's contract . " " You have n't told me . How in hell do they know ? " " Oh , about Miss Carson . It seems Marsh 's boy , Wallace , saw the two women in bed in intimate embrace . " " The breed girl ? " " Marie Wolf , I believe , is her name . I understand the boy has sworn to what he saw . " " Collingsworth know ? " " I believe not . He must be told . "
