txt It would be hard to find a slum more bleak and desolate than that in Gonaives , a city of 25,000 some 100 miles north of Port-au-Prince , the Haitian capital , which has its own massive slum situations . Gonaives resists description . The interminable mudcaked hovels , brackish ponds , and dirt- and filth-infested streets combine to give much of GonaIves the , appearance of Latin America 's most , abysmal poverty . One local commentator said of GonaIves that it was " a perennial Biafra . " Children wander through the streets with bodies which obviously have not been adequately cared for . Local authorities say that the incidence of serious disease in the children is such that at least half of them will not survive to adulthood . Even survival to the age of 20 carries with it immense problems . Unemployment is chronic in the area . Coffee and cotton plantations in the flatland around Gonaives are supposed to be the major source of employment for the city 's thousands . But there is strong evidence that the majority of residents do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officially set at 20 percent today , some 6 percentage points higher than when Papa Doc , as Frangois Duvalier was familiarly known , was installed as president . Given the population increase in the past 14 years , that suggests at least some improvement in a nation that is at the bottom end of Latin America 's economic and social scale . The new Haitian government , headed at least nominally by Jean-Claude Duvalier , the late dictator 's 20-year-old son , talks of doing much more , and is actively courting the United States and other nations for assistance . The problems facing his country , though , are immense and immediately apparent . Sitting listlessly on the ground outside their mud homes , many of the adult residents of Gonaives indicate they are not now working and have not for some time . The occasional odd job , begging , and barter provide the wherewithall to keep a family alive . " Give me a nickel , " the children ask visitors . " I am hungry . " They follow the visitor around with smiles on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , except , of course , for the warm tropical sun which blankets Go-naives and the surrounding countryside . Bleak landscape The trip from Port-au-Prince to Gonaives takes from three to four hours over a rutted road paralleling the coast of the Gulf of La Gonfive . The road passes through sugarcane country , sweeps alongside magnificent beaches that hold promise of a yet-to-bedeveloped tourist industry , and on through barren countryside where little more than cactus grows under the blazing sun . GonaIves basks in that sun with little shade from trees . Only an occasional yard sports a palm or other tree . The bleakness of the landscape is emphasized by the rotting hulks of old trees which have long since perished from lack of water . Gonaives and the impoverished , barren countryside suggest how seriously Haiti needs economic assistance . Yet the outside specialists here  --  from the United States , the Organization of American States , and the United Nations  --  are hard put to know where to begin . So much needs to be done . There is , however , agreement with the words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Haiti needs help . " Population surge The 14 years of President Duvalier 's rule , which ended with his passing April 21 , saw virtually no change in the livelihood of Haiti 's 4 million inhabitants , particularly those in places like Gonaives . In fact , there are some who argue that Haitians are worse off today than they were when Papa Doc came to power . There are more Haitians today than 14 years ago . The population increase , some 3.6 percent a year , has mushroomed the population totals dramatically in places like Gonaives . Given the lack of infrastructure in Haiti , however , United States Ambassador Clinton E. Knox , like many foreigners here , does not see how Haiti can absorb too much aid immediately . He talks of a modest $750,000 aid program over the next year or so ? provided Wash , ington would agree to resuming assistance which it cut of in 1963 as a result of American disapproval of the Duvalier dictatorship .
