No place in bleached and bare California has been harder hit by the two-year drought than Marin County . Strict rationing has been imposed , with water priced as high as $50 per 100 cu . ft. for those who exceed their allotments . The first bills under the new plan arrived last week , and some of them made a splash . <P> By cutting showers down to one a week , restricting toilet flushing , and doing laundry by hand , most residential users are able to live within the restrictions . But commercial establishments took a bath . Ondine 's , an internationally known French restaurant in Sausalito , got a two-month water bill for $645 - doubly galling since one of its attractions is its waterfront location . But that was nothing compared with a hotel that owed $4,153 and an ice cream parlor billed at $2,400 . <P> Sausalito 's mayor , Sally Stanford , is especially hot about the problem . Her restaurant , Valhalla , owes $1,300.                @ @ @ @ @
