As federal budgets go , the one that President Ford will submit to Congress this week resembles its predecessors in its time-worn definition of just how big the Government must be to meet the needs of the nation . The answer seems to be : bigger . The President called for federal spending in fiscal year 1976 , which begins next July , of a record $349.4 billion . That would be an increase of 11.5% over this year 's level , even though Ford is proposing almost no new programs except in the energy area . To keep outlays from rising even higher , Ford also called for spending cuts of $17 billion this year and next . What emerged as the budget 's main feature was the Grand Canyon-scale gap that it would accept between income and outgo . Between Ford 's own $16 billion tax cut proposal and the general shrinking in revenues caused by the recession , the projected deficits come to $34.7 billion for this year and an additional $51.9 billion in fiscal 1976-the deepest peacetime flow of red ink in U.S. history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ massive deficit to occur during the Administration of a Republican President , especially one who only a few months ago was aiming for a balanced budget in fiscal 1975 . Yet Ford sees no realistic way of avoiding it as he and his policymakers seek ways to cure the nation 's economic ills . <P> Ford 's 384-page budget contains few surprises and reflects the conservative economic bent of the President and his advisers . As such , it is headed for certain trouble at the hands of a largely liberal and Democratic Congress . Many of Ford 's spending-cut proposals strike heavily at the kind of social programs that no Congress would be likely to want to trim in the midst of an economic downturn . Among Ford 's reductions : <P> A 5% " cap " on increases in outlays for a broad range of federal benefit programs whose payments to recipients rise with the consumer price index . Among them : Social Security , civil service and military retirement payments and food stamps . Spending for all such programs would actually go up by $11.7 billion in Ford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to $17.8 billion . Ford 's justification for the ceiling : payments in these areas have increased faster than inflation in recent years . <P> A slash of $6.2 billion in other social programs not tied to the consumer price index . For example , Ford would shave $1.4 billion from Medicare through changes in cost-sharing formulas that would require patients to pay more in certain cases . <P> <P> A total of $4.7 billion in other savings , including deferral of $1.6 billion in spending on highway construction . <P> In areas of proposed spending increases , Congress is likely to grant Ford 's wish for higher outlays in space , science and technology ( from $4.2 billion to $4.6 billion ) ; energy research and development ( $1.1 billion to $1.6 billion ) ; community-development programs ( $3.3 billion to $4.1 billion ) ; and general revenue sharing . Ford wants the current $6.2 billion program , due to expire next year , extended through 1982.
