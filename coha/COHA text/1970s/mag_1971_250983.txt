The Supreme Court is generally thought to be drifting toward the right , but last week four of its actions left liberals little cause for complaint . &gt; Busing to promote integration in Southern school districts was approved unanimously by the court last term . The rationale : busing is sometimes necessary and constitutionally proper to undo state and local actions that have fostered illegal segregation . But is mandatory busing legal outside the South in areas where formal school-segregation policies have not existed ? By way of answer to that question , the court declined without comment to interfere with a lower court ruling that requires busing in Pontiac , Mich . In 1970 , Federal District Judge Damon J. Keith found that the Pontiac school board had " intentionally utilized the power at its disposal to locate new schools and arrange new boundaries in such a way as to perpetuate the pattern of segregation . " Judge Keith 's decision prompted violence and continuing resistance , but he was upheld by a court of appeals . And the Supreme Court 's unwillingness to review the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's lead . &gt;Southern desegregation was also aided by the court . The state of Virginia had wanted to expand the two-year program of its predominantly white Richard Bland College to four years . But the community of Petersburg , where Bland is located , already has a four-year school , Virginia State College , which is predominantly black . Both colleges were once officially segregated , and a special three-judge district court barred Eland 's expansion on the grounds that it would undercut efforts to integrate Virginia State . The Supreme Court agreed . It also let stand a lower court ruling that forbade Brighton , Ala. , to sell an abandoned junior high school building to a group intending to establish a whites-only private academy . The sale , the lower court said , would encourage racial discrimination . <P> <P> &gt;Parolees are almost as bereft of rights as prisoners . So lower federal courts declined to intervene when Raymond Arciniega 's parole was revoked . After serving nearly eight years of his ten-year sentence for selling heroin , Arciniega went to work booking acts into a Torrance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ex-convicts also worked there , and his parole board decided that he was violating the rule against associating with former prisoners . The Supreme Court unanimously found that conclusion unacceptable . Occupational association is not enough to send a man back to prison , said the court . " To so assume would be to render a parolee vulnerable whenever his employer , willing to hire ex-convicts , hires more than one . " The court reaffirmed the broad powers of parole boards to set conditions of release , but its ruling nonetheless was an indication that such actions of the boards are not beyond judicial scrutiny .
