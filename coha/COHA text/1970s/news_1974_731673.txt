txt The salesmen with the most status in New York do n't sell Gucci shoes or Rolls-Royce sedans or even Dustin Hoffman 's talents . They deal in New York 's most snobbish commodity , its writers . Diamond merchants and Mercedes dealers take a back seat to the pitchman who has a corner on Norman Mailer 's next book or the woman who will sell J. D. Salinger 's last word . But she says she 's not pressuring him for that . . Ordinary mortals have to reach to drop a name . For at least a third of the 150 literary agents in New York , it 's just a matter of recounting their last phone call . " IRWIN SHAW is waiting for me , " said Irving . Swifty Lazar , in the middle of a recent conversation about his newest client , Richard Nixon . Mho the former President is still recuperating from surgery and has n't even produced one word , Lazar has sold the rights to Nixon 's autobiography to Warner Paperback Library for $2.5 million . Swifty Lazar operates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handles film directors and screenwriters as well as literary figures such as Truman Capote , Vladimir Nabokov , William Saroyan , and Theodore H. White . Lazar is a lawyer who became an agent when be realized lawyers got one per cent , agents got 10 . His neighbor , Humphrey Bogart , gave him his nickname after he negotiated Jack Mabley 's column is on page4. some quick deals for him . But he- does n't handle actors now . " Their insecurities are too daily , " he says . He 's one literary agent who wo n't coddle his clients . " Literary agents who have to hold hands are handling amateurs , " be Sniffs . A LOT OF agents would disagree . They , say that in addition to negotiating the best possible deal for an author they must deal with his anxieties . Most of them love it . Frequent phone calls and emotional dependency from people they lionize prove that they 're needed . " Of course some of the aura and glamor rub off , " says Scott Meredith , an agent who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " , practices as charging fees to read unsolicited material and auctioning off manic scripts to the public . " You 're bound ' to become more intelligent after talking to Norman Mailer , " says Meredith , mentioning one client . Spiro - Agnew is another . When Agnew first approached him with his novel ** says he turned , the former Vice President down , Meredith , gave Agnew-a copy of the Meredith textbook , " Writing ' to Sell . " " He 's not Hemingway but he 's a pretty good adventure writer , " Meredith says . All agents admire their clients . That 's why they 're selling them , instead ; of - Buicks . " It 's crucial that you really ? feel that writers are special people ; : otherwise - yeu might as well-be selling toothpaste , " says Lynn Nesbit , who majored in drama at Northwestern University and became an agent after taking a publishing course at Radcliffe . Considered one of the best new agents , she handles Donald Barthelme " City . Life " , Tom Wolfe " The Electric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ) , and Michael Crichton " The Andromeda Strain " . " I DO N'T represent authors I do n't like , " says Robert Lescher , who likes Isaac Bashevis Singer , Dr. Benjamin Spock , and Calvin Trillin , a New Yorker magazine staff writer who lets Lescher handle deals for his freelance books and articles . " I talk to Robert at least once a week , " says Trillin , whose book , " American Fried , " was published by Doubleday this year . " For me an agent is partly a comfort . It 's not the money he gets ; the problem is what a dry goods merchant in Kansas City takes for granted  --  general competence . Publishers think this is a gentlemanly business but all the gentlemanly gestures are on the part of writers . " Agents see that a book is promoted , that ' editorial changes are made only with the writer 's consent , that review copies-are distributed . They do the " yelling " for writers , thus preserving the sacred relationship between.editor and writer . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an editor ' at Simon &; Schuster . " It 's nice to have someone else do the business . And a good agent is a professional . If an author is hysterical because his book has n't sold 10,000 copies in the first week , an agent tells him the realities . " BUT THE REALITY an agent tells each of his contacts ? writer and publisher  --  can differ as the situation requires . " You need an agent to work things out between this businessman and this maniac , the writer , " says Trillin , the author . " Publishers think writers are neurotic children with a certain facility . A lot are precisely that . An agent can say , ' You know how Henry is about these things , ' and they both nod . But the writer 's demands are fulfilled . " Some authors feel secure enough to deal without agents . Edmund Wilson was one . But in the last 10 years ; as million dollar movie and paperback rights make mouths water , agents have become more important . Most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Houghton-Miflin when he decided to become an agent . Candida Donadio , one of the most prestigious , started as a Girl Friday in an agency . The old time agents , such as the late Paul Reynolds Sr. , . maintained a determinedly snooty air . When Willa Cather asked him to check on her royalty statements , he dropped her . BUT THE newer agents , like Meredith , says , " This is n't a romance , this is a business association . " And there 's strong competition between them . Last spring , Meredith was asked by Rose Mary Woods to represent : axon . He says he turned Nixon down because he was n't planning to write a book about the " nifty gritty . " " I think Scott Meredith should get a new analyst , " was Lazar 's reaction . He signed the new client quickly . But the way Nixon got on his client list was unusual . Most authors do n't solicit the agent . " Do n't call us , we 'll call you " is more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parties and inquires as to their availability . After be secured a good deal for Moss Hart years ago , the author asked Lazar what he wanted for Christmas . " Cole Porter , " he replied . Lazar got Porter , and , he says , " We became very close friends . " BUM WHAT about unknowns ? To steal another cliche , It 's who you know . Meredith will read new manuscripts for a fee . But only a small percentage of these are ever signed on as clients . It 's better that Norman Mailer , who 's read your manuscript after a lecture , recommends you . That happened to Stephen , Smith , a 21-year-old author whose book , " American Boy " was sold by Meredith recently . And Lazar willingly read " The Chicken Chronicles " a first novel by young Paul Diamond . " Because his father , I. A. L. Diamond has been a client for 25 years . " The book was sold to Paramotuit Pictures within a week . Lesser known agents regularly read magazines , keeping an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign him on before the big guys get there . Not that they 'll admit it . In a world where status is paramount , that 's not something you want to get around .
