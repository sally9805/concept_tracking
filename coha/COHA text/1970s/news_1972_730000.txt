The fines arc part of a crackdown by city and state consumer officials against what they say is the travel industry 's practice of misleading consumers about the cost of package tours and vacation trips . The Consumer Frauds and Protection Bureau , under New York Attorney General Louis . T. Lefkowitz , has forced four major carriers to sign " assurances of discontinuance " in which they promise to stop similar allegedly misleading practices . A Federal Investigation Both agencies have also be-i to scrutinize the operations of travel " clubs " after numerous members complained ' they were not getting refunds . on canceled trips . In Washington , a spokesman for the Federal Trade Commission said that agency was in the midst of an investigation of travel and credit companies ? an investigation that will touch on abuses in buying travel packages . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carriers ' and travel agencies ran enticing advertisements showing only the minimum price of tours . For example , one shipping line headlined an ad , " Carib-. bean cruises ? 8 days from ; 8299 . " Inquirers , however , soon learned that only a few cabins // on a few off-season cruises were available at that price , In another case , a packagetour brochure still being promoted in New York is headlined " 3 to 14 nights from $155 " to " Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles or Hawaii , " 625 Is Tacked On Reading the fine print in. side , potential customers discover that the $155 trip is from Chicago to Las Vegas only , while the cheapest trip from New York begins at $199 . Furthermore , only a few hotels are included in the cheap rate and an extra $25 is tacked on for taxes and service . Consumers have complained that selling agents use the " bait and switch " tactic with such tours , talking a customer into a more expensive package after luring him into the office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priced package trips turn out to involve tiny autos , fourth-class hotels and minimal sightseeing . In addition , consumers discover that a trip may be inexpensive because certain meals , airport transfers and other components are not included , although this is usually mentioned in some inconspicuous part of a brochure or ad in very small type . Regulation 3 At Issue Bruce C. Ratner , head of the city consumer agency 's law-enforcement division , explained that its crackdown was based on violations of Regulation 3 . The law , which took effect last April , requires all companies to show both minimum and maximum costs of a trip . Mr. Ratner said a continuing survey of travel ads since the crackdown began indicated that travel companies " are cleaning up . " The cruise line , for example , now mentions that those Caribbean cruises cost " from $299 to $579 . " " At least customers can realize there is a range of prices and wo n't be shocked when they find out how much their kind of accommodations will cost , " he said . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If they are found to he in violation again , they could he fined up to $500 or enjoined from any advertis-ing : French Line , Swedish-American Line . Swissair , Air India , El Al , Hapag-Lloyd , El San Juan Hotel , Bahama Cruise Line , Travel-Go-Round , Cartan Travel , Orient Overseas Inc. , Trinidad and Tobago Board , Norwegian American Line , Liberty Travel , Asti Tours , Empress Travel , Princess Hotels International .

Print Size Prescribed Mr. Ratner noted that another law , Regulation 15 , which took effect last month , prohibits advertisers from putting hidden ( charges or special limitations in small print , and he said an investigation into violations of this rule was now under way . Under the rule , an airline may not advertise a cheap roundtrip flight to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it is only good when 15 people travel in a group between Jan. 1 and March 31 ' and leave on a weekday . Instead , the type showing the restrictions would have to be at least one-third as tall as the largest type used in the ad and a minimum of 10-point type in size . This is 10-point type . Recently , the Consumer Affairs Department received an assurance of discontinuance from the Passport Club , a group accused by its members of failing to tell subscribers that they ' , could not get a full refund if they canceled plans to go on a trip . The state consumer-frauds unit got similar assurances from Eastern , United and Pan American airlines , as well as the Cunard Lines . Cunard was accused of advertising a minimum price for cruises without specifying how many cabins were available at that price or that the price was based on two people sharing a room . Pan Am was accused of fraudulently implying in ads that movies , music and cocktails were available free on some flights to coach passengers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that certain cheap trips , especially those to California , were not available at certain times . Stephen Minden , deputy chief of the bureau , cited a United newspaper ad that appeared Nov. 23 . In tiny type , the ad said the offer expired Dec. 16 . Eastern was charged with misleading ads about the lower cost of after-dinner flights to some locations . In signing the assurances , the four companies admitted no wrongdoing . However , each paid for the cost of the investigation : Pan Am , $2,000 ; Eastern , $750 ; United and Cunard , $500 each . It was also learned that the Attorney General 's office is looking into the Sky Roamers travel club after being inunIdated with complaints from members who said the club canceled many trips and failed to refund payments for them . Travel Agents Concur f Frank Hefter , public-relations director for the American Society of Travel Agents , said in an interview that the association approved of the new regulations and of full disclosure of information in ads and brochures . " We feel the information should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , adding that the society gets many complaints about package tours and trips from consumees . In its March issue , Consumer Reports magazine charged that Eastern Airlines was selling a package tour of Disney World in Florida for $619 , while a consumer would pay only $444 for the elements in the tour if he booked them on his own . Eastern disputed some of those figures . However , Mr. Hefter acknowledged that allinclusive package tours " generally " are more expensive than the sum of their components ? air fare , hotels and the like . The trip , he said , " is made easier for the traveler . It is packaged . And the packaging has to be paid for . "
