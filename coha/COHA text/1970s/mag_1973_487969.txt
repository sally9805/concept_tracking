What sounds like a book , looks like a book , and is n't a book ? The Human Nature Industry is one answer . If Mar ' shall McLuhan turns out to be right about the death of " print culture " and the- end of reading , this would be the sort of thing to publish . Since it is unreadable , no one should ever have to read it . Perhaps it was n't meant to be read , lust made , another expendable product of the industry it purports to depict . Through eleven chapters of coy prose the authors pursue the overwhelming question . But what human nature is seems to baffle or bore most of the live sources they first explore . They therefore go from consulting experts to consulting books and folk wisdom , then to consulting themselves , and manage to come up with three specious species where one real one would do : Homo . Tinkerectus , Homo Inherens and Homo Exchangenesis , if you please . The authors finally muster enough courage to pronounce the idea of human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . Actually , I can imagine a very good kind of book on the human nature industry , one which would deal with what this one says it does : " how human nature is manufactured , distributed , advertised , and consumed in the United States and parts of Canada . " For although the idea of human nature is a gaseous essence and eludes the grasp like fog , it has a compelling odor and is exploitable by a host of entrepreneurs who try to , dissipate it or bottle it up for sale . Esalen , for example , has become a kind of blue chip in a human nature stock market . There is hardly an image of " the truly human " so strained and ridiculous that it has not found some eminent mandarin to promote it . This state of affairs surely calls for a Swift , or at least a Nader . Alas , the book at hand does n't ' begin to @o the much needed , serious or satirical job of examining the assumptions and values of the anthroposophical moguls . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it does , since I can discover in it no coherent statement of plan , investigation , argument or conclusion . All the more astounding to see the Rockefeller Foundation thanked in the ' acknowledgments for supporting this " research and report . " What research ? What report ? No wonder the , big foundations are the sub -- ject of increasing skepticism . The authors are oddly , even interestingly collaborative . Mr. Cannel is a journalist , a former newspaper correspondent and columnist ; Dr. Macklin is a professor of anthropology . Certainly both their professions have contributed to the myths surrounding their common subject . One might legitimately have expected an entertaining , if not a conclusive book from them . Instead what one gets is a patchwork of puerile observations , interspersed with snatches of conversations or quotations from the writings of nearly every captain , ' living or dead , of the soi-disant " industry . " From time to time this mixture is stirred by a portentous commonplace : " So that is bow a working model of human nature works . It provides you with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " All in all , the book says more about the publishing industry than it does about the human nature industry . Voltaire remarked that the world is made ignorant by the mere abundance of books , and this is one that would prove him right . There are certainly too many bad or non-books like this published . The blind mechanical or logistical " requirements " of company size , productivity , and growth account for some of the absurd pileup . At that , too many demonstrably worthwhile books can not be ' found in bookshops , particularly if they are more than six months old. , And if publishers cut back on the number of " titles " they issue , often it is the better ones that get cut . Richard Simon , in a letter of 1936 found in his partner M. Lincoln Schuster 's prematurely opened " box ' for future generations , " said , " The books we publish now will be mostly forgotten .
