While the devaluation of the dollar may be the most dramatic measure of the U.S. 's reduced clout in world commerce , another event may ultimately have a greater impact on the nation 's economic health . It is the shocking decline of good old Yankee ingenuity , otherwise known as research and development . <P> The U.S. has always prided itself on being the world 's undisputed leader in technological innovation . Since World War II foreign demand for aircraft , computers , automated tools and other products of American labs and workshops could be relied on to provide a fat surplus in the nation 's balance of trade . No more . Though the U.S. still retains an overall lead in total amounts spent on R. and D. and in numbers of new inventions , its chief economic rivals are expanding their research efforts at much faster rates . One consequence is becoming dramatically clear this year : because the U.S. no longer commands such a high share of the world 's high-technology market , it no longer can offset its large imports of low-technology items @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1978 the country will import substantially more manufactured goods than it will export . The deficit for the first half of 1978 was $14.9 billion , which will do more damage to the trade balance this year than anything but the $40 billion in oil that the U.S. will import . By contrast , West Germany and Japan are expected to run surpluses in manufactured goods of $49 billion and $63 billion respectively . <P> According to the National Science Foundation , in the years 1953 through 1955 the U.S. introduced 63 " major " technological innovations . West Germany , Japan , Britain and France had together only 20 . But now foreign competitors are bringing out as many new products and processes as the U.S.-or more . In the category of new patents , a key measure of R. and D. vitality , American inventors were granted 45,633 patents by major trading partners in 1966 , while the U.S. gave only 9,567 to non-Americans that year . By 1976 , however , the so-called patent balance had shifted radically . The number of U.S. inventors granted patents abroad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number of foreigners gaming U.S. patents had almost doubled , to 18,744 . Says Frank Press , the chief White House science adviser : " It is the trends that are important , and the percentage increases in some countries are growing faster than here . " <P> Why did the trends begin to shift ? Arthur M. Bueche , senior vice president for R. and D. at General Electric , which remains the most research-oriented of big U.S. companies ( 862 patents won last year ) , is concerned about a change in the American character . Says he : " We 've gone from an expansive , gung-ho attitude to a defensive , ' What 's in it for me ? ' attitude . " Faced with a challenge , Americans are now more likely to say , " Let 's not risk it . " Among factors behind the U.S. 's " innovation recession " :
