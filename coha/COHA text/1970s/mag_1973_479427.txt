IN DECEMBER 30 , 1969 , K. R. Morris , a rep- / resentative from a well-known Northern California loan brokerage firm , visited the Sausalito home of Belle Shaw , a seventy-seven-yearold widow . Mrs. Shaw had earlier expressed an interest in borrowing some money for home repairs . Morris listed Mrs. Shaw 's assets and liabilities on the loan application , She had $300 in a Bank of America checking account , a 1957 Chevrolet , and a combined income from Social Security benefits and rent from boarders totaling $716 per month . Monthly payments on the house she and Mr. Shaw had purchased in 1947 were $126 . Her equity in the property , the difference between its value and the amount still owed , was handsome : $27,000 . Morris agreed to arrange a $1,400 loan . His company would obtain the money from a private investor who in turn would receive a " second mortgage " on Mrs. Shaw 's home . The investor 's profit would amount to 10 percent , the maximum interest rate allowed on second mortgages under California law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company , American Plan Investment Corporation , received a 15 percent " brokerage commission " as payment for services rendered . Mrs. Shaw paid this fee , plus the cost of an appraisal , policy of title insurance , escrow fees , loan service fee , and a fire insurance policy , from the proceeds of the loan . She received $1,023 in cash . Approximately three months later , on March 26 , 1970 . Morris again visited Mrs. Shaw . This time and on each of the four additional occasions he visited her over the next two years , Morris arranged another loan that paid off the previous one and netted Mrs. Shaw more cash . Because a large part of each new loan went to pay off its predecessor before it was due , Mrs. Shaw was required to pay several hundred dollars in prepayment penalties . Actually , she never knew about these payments because the money was conveniently subtracted from the proceeds of each new loan and transferred , via complex paperwork , to the broker 's coffers . True , this carefully laid trap was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others , some of them equally treacherous . For example , Mrs. Shaw paid a $40 appraisal fee for each loan , even though her home had been My deeds upon my head ! ? Shylock , The Merchant of Venice appraised as recently as three months before by the same company . She paid the 15 percent brokerage fee for each loan . Then , because the broker shrewdly wrote each new loan so that the largest portion of the proceeds went to pay off its predecessor , she ended up paying the 15 percent a second time . The result was a steadily climbing pyramid of debt . Each time Mrs. Shaw borrowed she received a few hundred dollars in cash and increased her debt by a few thousand . She came back for more , she said , because it was all so easy . Indeed it was . The complex manipulations were handled by an expert . Mrs. Shaw never had to get out of her chair , being required only to sign her name to several tedious-looking documents . By the time Mrs. Shaw finally met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six loans with American Plan . The brokerage firm had received a grand total of $10,460 in fees for services rendered . Mrs. Shaw had received a total of $7,038 in cash , and $378 had been paid to creditors at her request . For the sixth loan she had signed a note agreeing to repay $7,560 within thirty-six months , plus a " balloon balance " on the thirty-seventh month , amounting to $19,536. * The balloon balance is in many ways the key to the second-mortgage business . It allows a broker to lure borrowers into loans with low monthly payments that often do little more than pay the interest . Then on the thirty-seventh month the balance of the loan immediately becomes due and payable . The supposed advantage to the borrower is that while he can not afford equal monthly payments that completely retire the loan over a period of three years , he can afford a loan with a balloon balance . But in most instances the hal- *The repayment of Mrs. Shaw 's first loan of $1,400 required thirty-seven monthly installments of $45.18 , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 51,671.66 for the $1,023 Mrs. Shaw received . Compared to average second-mortgage loans , this was not an expensive cost , but second mortgages become outrageously expensive when repayment plans include balloon balances that require refinancing . Mrs. Shaw 's sixth loan , for example , called for monthly payments of $210 , a sum that barely paid the interest on a principal of $21,000 . The final cost to Mrs. Shaw for all six loans can he measured only by comparing the ac ? tual money she received ? $7,416 ? with the entire amount that she had agreed to repay-827,096. loons are arranged without informing the borrower . Even worse , most people can pay them only by " refinancing . " In effect this means paying the expensive loan costs all over again . In a complaint filed in San Francisco Superior Court , attorney Bishop claimed that the mortgage broker had committed " acts of concealment and mis-statements . . . all done wilfully , oppressively and maliciously , and with the intent of defrauding and deceiving the Plaintiff , to her detriment . " Among other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of $10 million . American Plan has generally denied the charges in the complaint . Meanwhile , like the Vietnam village that must be destroyed to be saved , Mrs. Shaw 's home was sold to avoid foreclosure . While the enormity of her loss arouses feelings of pity , perhaps anger , her case is hardly unique . Each year tens of thousands of people find themselves pressed against a wall of debt raised by a second mortgage or . more precisely , by the mysterious charges that inevitably come creeping out of the fine print . Although the specific methods differ from state to state , the swindle is a national one . The swindle depends on the naivete of poor and semi-literate people who believe TV and newspaper commercials advertising the benefits of debt consolidation and QUICK CASH ! The advertisements compare one 's equity in a home to money in the bank . Borrowing thus becomes similar to " making a withdrawal , " and the cost of the transaction almost never gets discussed . Second-mortgage brokers often claim that their customers come to them animated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an element of truth , it fails to explain the rapacity of the brokers . Many of them do not hesitate to violate the law to take advantage of people forced to borrow money to pay unforeseen hospital bills , tax assessments , funeral expenses . or hail bondsmen ; or , as in the case of Mrs. Shaw , to exploi t people who legitimately need extra cash to improve their lives . Polishing a shabby image M Y OWN INTRODUCTION to this depressing business took place in October 1970 , when , as a copy writer and account executive for a Newport Beach advertising agency , I was assigned to make bright the image of Union Home Loans , the largest and oldest firm of California mortgage brokers . The firm maintains offices in fifteen cities and spends nearly $750,000 a year on its advertising . At the time , I knew nothing at all about second mortgages , remembering only that as a kid I 'd seen ads on TV showing men in shiny suits and thin black moustaches waving fistfuls of imitation cash . Like almost everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ethics of such a business . But my own doubts consisted of nothing more substantial than cloudy images of tasteless advertising and perhaps the faint memory of Biblical or Shakespearean references to the evils of moneylending . I reread The Merchant of Venice and began to look for a quality of mercy in the corporate structure I was helping to promote . More than once I decided that things were hopeless ; more than once I told myself that I must quit and find myself a different line of work . But always I argued that to leave too soon would accomplish nothing , for myself or anyone else . To leave simply because I disagreed with certain business practices seemed to me comparable to the act of an ostrich burying its head in the sand . I might avoid guilt by avoiding association , but someone else would surely take my place . and the practices would continue . One of the principals in the agency argued convincingly that we had an opportunity to change bad business practices and to do good by arguing the long-term benefits of honesty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salary , I found myself agreeing with him . Soon afterward , for even more money , I was persuaded to join Union Home Loans as Director of Marketing . My former employer reportedly advised J.A . Seedman , the president of Union Home Loans , to have me sign an agreement by which I would promise to remain silent about any " secrets " learned in the company 's employ . Instead , ' recall that Seedman simply told me on the day he hired me , " If you ever cross me , I 'll kill you . " It was one of the few times that he succumbed to melodrama . I stayed with the company for a year , arguing throughout my tenure in favor of change , reform , honesty in advertising , fairness , and reduced fees . Sometime in December 1971 I realized that continued arguments were useless . Seedman refused to explain a number of practices I suspected might involve the company in corporate fraud . I had lost the hope , probably na ? ve , of working for reform from within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nor did I seek other employment . Instead , in March of 1972 . I requested a thirty-day leave of absence for " reasons of personal health . " Fifteen days later I was told that I was " overqualified " for the job and that my presence was therefore no longer required . The parting was neither angry nor bitter . I remember feeling only a sense of freedom . I had begun to feel trapped as long ago as December 1970 , the month in which the company answered a complaint by the California Department of Real Estate ( DIRE ) by signing a consent order agreeing not to advertise falsely . While not admitting guilt , the company paid a $10.000 judgment ; six lesser firms paid additional amounts . At the time nobody at the advertising agency understood that we were writing questionable ads . In June of 1971 , however , many of Union 's employees still worried about some of the advertising appearing on TV and in newspapers . " Those ads that promise monthly payments of $18.53 for every $1,000 you borrow are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Director of Loan Administration . " People come in here with an ad torn out of a newspaper and say they want a loan just like that . The loan officer has to do some pretty fancy talking to switch them to another deal . " The law enforcers at DRE apparently did n't notice the ads . But Lee Eccles , a Los Angeles attorney for the Federal Trade Commission , did notice them . He also recalled having seen " scores of complaints " about Union Home Loans . Armed with the recent federal Truth in Lending Law , Eccles filed a suit naming Irving Tushner , Executive Director and " owner " of the firm , Seedman , and the company as defendants . Among other things , the complaint specified that the company advertised loan terms it did not usually arrange , at rates not generally available . In February of 1972 , this case ended with another consent order . Again they admitted no guilt . The advertising was changed . AF T ER CONCLUDING NEGOTIATIONS with the - FTC , Seedman noted in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every intention of maintaining and embellishing our image as the Flag Ship ' of our industry . We will do everything in our power to live up to the premier position which we hold , not only in the eyes of the Federal Trade Commission , but with our peers in the industry as well . " Such a statement is not uncharacteristic of the way many people in the industry talk when discussing alleged complaints and malpractices . Brokers and salesmen typically adopt a breezy manner and speak in pious tones about fraudulent and deceitful practices of banks and savings and loans institutions . But these same individuals will , in unguarded moments , betray an incredible amount of repressed guilt , pain , and helpless frustration . One can not but feel pity for many of them who obviously feel trapped by circumstances over which they feel they have no control . Privately , for instance , Seedman admitted that his was a " scabby business . " He qualified his distaste by arguing that mortgage brokers today are where the savings and loans were twenty years ago . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring the level of the business up . " It is unclear just what Seedman means when he refers to the savings and loans . Few would argue that they are now , or ever were , similar to mortgage brokers . But Union 's president is a fast-talking salesman when he speaks on this issue , and he speaks on it often , as does Leonard Smith , Union 's corporate attorney . Smith and Seedman both enjoyed talking about their attempts to " raise the level of the business . " Their critics , among them skeptical state legislators , take this to mean " improve the industry 's image . " So , in fact , did the president and other executives of Union 's former ad agency when they argued in October of 1971 that the company should stop using religion to sell loans by employing Reverend Joe B. Hardwick , A.A. , B.A. , Pastor of the Praises of Zion Baptist Church located in the black ghetto area of Los Angeles . Every Sunday morning at seven , Hardwick performs commercials for Union Home Loans on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a diamond ring and has a penchant for long black cigars and alleged private meetings with Mayor Yorty , crooned in early 1972 that " the people at Union Home Loans have kept me on the air for going on six years and then in March we 're going to celebrate our sixth year . By the grace of God if you stand with me and keep on calling ... that will insure me coming back next Sunday morning . They are the leading home loan brokers . I know ; I have had to use their services myself . " The reverend sends letters to members of his congregation signed " Yours in Christ , Rev. Joe B. Hardwick . " At the bottom of the page is the inscription : " Union Horne Loans Cares . " Union did n't agree with the ad agency 's suggestion that Hardwick be dismissed . The company apparently believes that Hardwick is responsible for a good deal of business in the black ghetto of Los Angeles . The insurance angle S OMETHING ELSE THAT HELPS assuage Seed-man 's feelings about the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it . For example . according to the Union Home Loans note that sets forth the basic terms and conditions of its loans , two dollars per month go to pay " the expense of keeping records of the loan and of monthly payments . " Several of Union 's loan officers admitted a sense of guilt about the inclusion of this fee , pointing out that it amounts to " charging people money to take their money . " One office manager reportedly went as far as striking the offensive clause out of every note before asking the borrower to sign . Perhaps the most expensive and deadly traps set in the fine print of second-mortgage contracts are late charges . Together with the low monthlypayments that result from the incorporation of " balloon balances , " these are often useful devices that enable an experienced broker to steal from unsuspecting borrowers . Those people who allow their payments to become late often find themselves at the end of three years owing more than they originally had borrowed . In Sacramento , for example , attorney Irvine Dungan has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that deal specifically with the subtlety of the late charge . One of them concerns a disabled city sanitation employee who reportedly borrowed $3,500 in 1963 , borrowed another $4,700 in 1966 to pay off the balance still due , and then was forced to borrow yet another $7,200 in 1969 to pay off the balance on the second loan , The suit alleges that the borrower was not told that he would be assessed a $45 late charge if his payments were more than five days late . Union Home Loans has denied this charge . The high late charges , quite obviously , bring enormous profit to the broker . They also help force the borrower into a position where he must " refinance " his loan or accept foreclosure . Seed-man once explained that the company had once held it as axiomatic that if a borrower was late once , then automatically he would be late with every succeeding payment . TET ANOTHER souncE of certain profit is the 1 gimmick of selling the borrower some life insurance along with his loan . Many loan salesmen admit that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the documents and say nothing . " It 's best just to hand them the papers and a pen , " said Union 's San Diego office manager . " Then while you point out the several places to sign their names , you keep talking . Talk about kids , baseball , the weather , anything . Keep them from asking questions . If they do , you 're dead . " When Seedman was informed that many of Union 's salesmen were using these very tactics to score a " penetration " rate as high as 80 percent , he said : " Do n't rock the boat . That insurance is worth about $200,000 a year in income . " The profit to be gained in insurance can be demonstrated by a proceeding against R. W. Greenburg , a former loan salesman with the Mortgage Refinance Company in Los Angeles . When borrowers Roy and Lillian Snyder came to Greenburg in March 1967 , they asked for ' about $4,000 to pay hills . " They eventually agreed to borrow $5,250 , making special arrangements to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ According to E. F. DeVilbiss , who presided at a 1969 hearing initiated by the Department of Real Estate , " the insurance premium deducted from the loan proceeds was $1,177.20 . The evidence established that the purchase of insurance by borrower Snyder was not an independent decision . To this day , the borrower has no clear idea why he needed insurance or why his wife , who was not a party to the transaction , needed insurance . " Two $10,000 credit life insurance policies were written and paid for , a total of $20,000 insurance on a $5,250 loan . This is cuntrary to the plain language of Section 779.4 of the Insurance Code of California .... The insurance was written to . increase the broker commission from $750 to $2,500 . " In other words , a large insurance premium had conveniently been added to the loan . This boosted the total amount borrowed above $5,000 . Thus , the law limiting the broker 's fee to a 15 percent maximum no longer applied . So instead of receiving a mere 15 percent on $5,000 ( $750 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( $2,5001 . Although the hearing officer found that Green-burg had acted with the " knowledge and consent " of the company and its principal , and that this act was " willful and dishonest , " the company and its principal received only a thirty-day license suspension . Today , almost six years after arranging the Snyder loan , Greenburg reportedly remains active as the principal in his own mortgage broker firm and is appealing the finding of the hearing officer . The sympathy of politicians T HE LENIENCY OF THE DRE possibly coincides with the fact that the California Real Estate Commissioner , Robert F. Karpe , is himself a second-mortgage broker , with offices in Bakersfield . In addition , his firm 's advertising appears to violate Sections 10235 and 10237.7 of the Business and Professions Code , by failing to make clear Karpe 's role as a broker . Not surprisingly , DRE has a notorious reputation among attorneys and members of the public for responding more to the interests of real estate brokers and salesmen than the consumer . Lee Eccles , formerly with the FTC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Los Angeles office . The results of exhaustive research had indicated in his opinion that Union 's collection agency , Western Computer Services , was in reality an alter ego of Union Home Loans and that borrowers were thus being charged fees in excess of the state mortgage broker laws . Eccles ' letter documenting this research went unanswered . Ed Dilkes , a Los Angeles attorney who has dealt with more than seventy-five cases involving mortgage brokers in his two years with Legal Aid , claims he has made numerous specific complaints to DRE . " I have never in my life received a reply from them in the mail indicating any action was taken , " he said . " They do not police the industry . " Herman Roth , a special investigator with the Los Angeles office of DRE before retiring in 1970 , disagrees . Pointing to a file of more than a hundred cases involving charges of fraud , usury , and dishonest dealing by mortgage brokers , he expresses pride in his department 's record . Roth admits that " there 's no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He also admits that it is difficult to remember very many actions resulting in a serious discipline . License revocations , for example , are usually accompanied by a stay of execution pending no additional violations for at least three years . Another aspect of mortgage-broker activity that goes virtually unregulated concerns foreclosure sales . In Southern California , for example , there is a group known popularly as the " forty thieves . " According to Ed Dilkes of Legal Aid , " their business is to show up at foreclosure sales and buy ' distressed properties . ' They work out among themselves which person will buy which ... property . They defy control and openly engage in price fixing , " Peter Wallin , a Legal Aid attorney who conducts a seminar for legal-service attorneys interested in mortgage broker problems , says that " fraudulent foreclosure proceedings are quite common in secondary financing situations ... . The sale itself is often a farce . " An interesting illustration of how the game is played is provided by a case now pending against one Max D. Kessler and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kessler . The name of the company is Gem Properties , Inc . Long Beach Legal Aid attorneys , working with attorneys from the Western Center on Law and Poverty , claim that their client , Joseph Gonzales , was the victim of " actions . conducted pursuant to a preconceived , and a successful , plan to obtain plaintiff 's home for a pittance . " Gonzales , the father of five children , purchased a two-bedroom home in 1958 . At the time the complaint was filed , the home had a value of $17,000 . Gonzales had an $11.000 equity in the property . According to the suit , Gonzales had arranged a second mortgage through Aanies Home Loans , one of the larger firms in the state . Several years later he fell behind in his payments . Gem Properties then purchased the mortgage , and Max Kessler was substituted as the trustee who would conduct the auction at the foreclosure sale . According to Gonzales , neither Aames Horne Loans nor Kessler notified him of the change in status . When he finally did discover that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempted to pay off the entire debt , going as far as obtaining an additional loan for that purpose . Gonzales went more than once to George Kessler 's home with the money , but he found that no one would answer the door . Finally , the home was sold to Gem Properties for somewhat less than $1,000 . Gonzales was then evicted and lived with his five children in an automobile for several days until the Welfare Department found living quarters for them . According to Edward J. O'Conner , the Superior Court judge who heard the case , " during all of this time , the plaintiff suffered from a defective heart condition and from diabetes . " Testifying at the trial was one Herbert Goldberg who , according to a summary of his testimony , is in the business of purchasing property at trustee sales . It is a standard business practice of the Kesslers to employ tricks and devices to avoid competitive bidding at trustee 's sales , " said Goldberg , - 50 that the Kesslers have a reputation among trustee sale bidders . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because they will not he able to buy any good property . " The Kesslers are today appealing a judgment in favor of Gonzales . One prominent mortgage broker admits that years ago he attended meetings of the " forty thieves . " Ile declined to join the group not because he felt he would develop a guilty conscience but because he was advised by his attorney that he could end up in jail . Based on simple percentages , the fear of going to jail seems a hit unrealistic . Seedman has boasted in public , for example , that in his first two years with Union Home Loans he disposed of $14 million worth of property that had been foreclosed upon . When asked how he gained control of the property in the first place , he declined to comment . Curiously , the Department of Real Estate appears uninterested in this puzzle . Attorneys Wallin and Dilkes agree that existing state regulation of mortgage broker practices is very much to the broker 's advantage . " Whenever an industry feels itself threatened by regulation , " says Dilkes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to co-opt the regulatory agency , which is essentially what has happened with DRE . The other is to promulgate complexity and then hide behind it " For example , it often takes me twenty minutes or even an hour of pouring over the documents when a client comes in just to determine what has happened . And I 'd like to regard myself as somewhat knowledgeable . " In fact , few attorneys , public or private , have more than a rudimentary knowledge of the mortgage-broker laws or even what constitutes a second mortgage . Thus , consumers are left with no recourse but to write angry letters to various state agencies that seldom seem to respond . Mortgage brokers , on the other hand , often employ expensive legal talent to settle cases out of court . Union Home Loans is presently engaging the services of the Beverly Hills firm of Ball , Hunt , Hart , Brown and Baerwitz . The Brown is former California governor Edmund G. " Pat " Brown . Not surprisingly , there are those who think that mortgage-loan brokers should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this unlikely possibility by warning that if they were not around to perform their " service , " the slack would he taken up by black market extortionist loan sharks . f A woman who lost her home to a second-mortgage loan suggested that this was an odd comment coming from a mortgage broker . ) The same prominent broker is fond of relating a story about a Chicano borrower who returned to his office one day to show off his newborn son named after the broker . " I wanted you to know , " he told him , " that i 'm so happy you were there when I needed you . I 'll never forget what you 've done for me . " SINCE MY OWN RETIREMENT from the . second-mortgage business I have agreed to work for the California Senate Subcommittee Panel on Mortgage Loan Brokers . I have tried to draft laws for the present session of the legislature that will help to correct the abuses inherent in the business . Even so , I remain both skeptical and cynical . The mortgage brokers can count @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ include not only their own lobby but also the DRE and the California Real Estate Association ) , and it is doubtful that any legislation will manage to get out of committee . Often I have asked myself dismal questions about the loss of conscience and the equanimity with which so many people apparently accept the commonplace of political corruption . I have no answers to such questions , and yet I am unwilling to succumb to the luxury of despair .
