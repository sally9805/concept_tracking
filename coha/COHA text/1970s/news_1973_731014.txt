txt Congress and the states need to take a closer look at what the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is doing to the American countryside , says Gov . Jimmy Carter of Georgia . Having said that , Governor Carter journeyed to Washington to ask for a congressional probe of the corps ' " apparent bias " in favor of the construction of dams . Immediate target of the Governor 's wrath is the proposed Spewrell Bluff Dam ? a $170 million corps project 50 miles south of Atlanta due to break ground next year . No one but Governor Carter remained in the way of the dam . But the Governor , surprising some local folks who had hoped for soaring land values and a construction boom , has dropped a bombshell on it . GAO report used Pulling out facts from a confidential report by the General Accounting Office , Governor Carter blasted the // *Governor rips holes in Georgia dam plan // dam as poor for the economy , poor for local residents , and detrimental to the area 's pristine environment . The Governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urged reporters to do their best to get a copy . This reporter did . The GAO report observes that the corps has attempted to justify the dam primarily on the basis of power generation , recreation , flood control , area redevelopment , and fish and wildlife conservation . Yet in each of these areas , the GAO , Congress 's watchdog agency , has a harsh comment : ? " The recreation benefits claimed by the corps appeared to be overstated . " ? " The power benefits were marginal , and there was some question whether the cost allocated to power can be recovered . . . " ? " Flood-control benefits were minimal .. .. " ? " Area redevelopment benefits were overstated . .. " Ecological impact In addition , the GAO found the project would " have a significant adverse impact on the environment ' and that " 85-90 percent " of the archaeological sites identified in the area " would be inundated " by the dam . Governor Carter , who was trained as a nuclear physicist , took particular aim at the corps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corps ' figures , are marginal , he observed . And the corps ' figures are - exaggerated . In justifying the proposal for instance , the corps rated the dam 's turbines at 170,500 kilowatts rather than their actual rated capacity of 150,000 kilowatts . " They could only make the project break even , according to their own statements , by a 20,500 kilowatt overload constantly on the generators , " the Governor said . Recreation Questioned Recreation benefits also were questioned . The dam 's estimated cost has been steadily rising ? about 10 percent a year over original figures . To justify the increased expenditures , the corps has boosted the dam 's potential value for recreation by 16.5 times over the first estimate in 1962 . The recreation values are questionable anyway , the Governor notes . Within 60 miles of the new dam are already eight lakes or dams in existence or being built , and some are infrequently used . Most Georgia recreation agencies , as well as the U.S. Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife , oppose the dam ? favoring instead a free-flowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figures on flood control were challenged , also . The biggest effects on flooding , says the GAO , would not be at Albany , Newton , and Bainbridge which have been flooded in the past . Instead , the dam would protect mostly woodlands and farming areas . Had the dam been built during the record flood in 1925 , the $2 million in flood damage at Albany would have been reduced by only $35,700 . Finally , the Governor noted , the corps ' cost estimates are based on borrowing money to build it at 3.25 percent ? something not many people can do today . Congress has designated a minimum interest rate of 6.8 percent on such projects . Hours of research Governor Carter put in " hundreds of hours " studying the Spewrell Bluff Dam project . He talked to 50 delegations representing both sides . He flew over the area two times by helicopter and canoed down the river twice , he says . Land speculators and construction people would be the prime beneficiaries of the dam , the Governor asserts . Taxpayers would be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the Corps of Engineers to - keep  --  their own  --  functions ? at ? thepresent capacity , " the Governor says . " I think there has to be generated a more inquisitive attitude on the part of the Congress through the General Accounting Office , through public officials like myself , and through the other departments of the federal government . " Across the country , the Governor says , many unneeded dams may already have been built . A new way should be found to evaluate such projects which would put the research and decisionmaking authority outside a group like the corps , which is naturally inclined to perpetuate itself .
