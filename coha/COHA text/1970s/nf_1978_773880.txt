txt // it happen . It may be the first time they 've seen your show , and this may be the only time they will ever see it . The way you enter should establish a relationship with the audience that lets them know who you are and that you 're prepared to give them a good show . You must be confident that you have a good show . Your preplanning and rehearsals help assure this confidence . There are many techniques for establishing initial communication with the audience . A smile never hurts . A pleasant exterior , smooth motions , and eye contact with the audience works wonders . Make your audience feel special . Perform for them , not at them . When you begin performing , you are the center of their attention and your format and material will help you maintain and lead their attention and interest all the way to your finale . A general rule for exits is that they should be short and sweet . Once you 've reached the peak , exit purposefully . This will tend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encores . If you must do an encore , have something rehearsed and planned . To be effective , an encore should , at least , sustain the same energy level of your last selection and , ideally , take the show to a new peak of excitement . COSTUMES Costumes communicate the image you wish an audience to form of you . When you plan your show , decide what visual effect you wish to project and choose costumes that are consistent with the total concept of the show . A strong visual impact heightens the total effectiveness of the presentation . Audiences generally expect performers to have a speTHE // cial look . Everyday clothing or accessories rarely excite them . In planning what to wear when performing , consider the prospective audience and the requirements of possible future engagements . The general direction and emphasis of the total show is the best guide for the role costumes will play in it . In today 's music industry audiences generally accept any costumes performers choose to wear . Some superstars are known for their unusual or unique costumes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performer 's personality while underscoring and highlighting artistic excellence . One of the first decisions to be made , if yours is a unit , is whether everybody will dress alike ; if the total concept blends different personalities into a solid , unified scheme , identical costumes may be called for . Where greater individuality is to be stressed , the costumes may be planned to conform to a central theme or similar design , varying in color , texture , or accessories . An illustration of this would be where colors are coordinated to sustain visual harmonies while individual costumes may be different in style or cut . If the show 's concept emphasizes the differences between members of the performing unit , each member may dress according to personal taste . Once you 've determined the look you wish to project you can then select the best costumes for your show . Five main points should be considered in selecting these costumes : ( 1 ) appearance ; ( 2 ) suitability ; ( 3 ) comfort ; ( 4 ) durability ; and ( 5 ) cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , be suitable for the engagement , comfortable to perform in , durable enough to be used for many performances , and be within the limits of your financial circumstances . Always establish a realistic budget for your costumes . // If your funds are limited , plan simple basic outfits which can be interchanged for variety or easily matched for uniformity . You may purchase your costumes readymade , rent some for special occasions , or have them specially designed and tailored for you . The point is , stick with a concept , stay within your budget , and use your imagination and resources to get the best costumes for your show . Costumes are a major investment for performers . Very often this investment is made in a haphazard manner . Performers should avoid buying unnecessary costumes or accessories and those of limited use . To get the most for each dollar invested in costumes , you should realistically project the number and type of costumes which will be adequate for your prospective engagements . Analyze the costume requirements of the members of your unit . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show , while featured performers may change for each show . Once you decide what you really need in the way of costumes , and know how much money you have to spend , you can use your ingenuity to get the most from your investment . Renting costumes is usually more expensive than buying them or having them tailored . Store-bought outfits , though more economical , often lack that " special " look which helps performers sparkle . You can save money and get interesting costumes if you know someone talented who designs and sews well . The two of you can come up with costumes specially designed to fit the visual concept you wish to project . Explore the possibility of an arrangement where you advertise the designer 's creations in exchange for a special price . The type and frequency of your engagements , the image you want to project , and the amount of money you can commit to costumes must be taken into account when // planning your show . If you choose your costumes wisely and maintain and care for them properly , your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SPECIAL EFFECTS The imaginative use of lighting adds another dimension to a show . Lighting can help create a mood , highlight the performance , and add additional excitement to the pre-sentation . Most places that feature live entertainment have some type of theatrical lighting equipment available to the performer . This varies from a single spotlight that sometimes works to a full array of spots , dimmers , colors , and strobe units ? complete with a light man . Places that regularly feature top names usually have lighting facilities adequate for most shows . Check the lighting available for your show in advance . If you find that it is inadequate , you may be able to persuade the employer to provide or rent additional lighting at his ex-pense . If the available lighting will seriously hamper the presentation of your show and the employer is unwilling to pay the entire cost of renting more , you may offer to share the cost . If you have to rent lighting equipment ask the employer to order it for you . Theatrical lighting rental companies prefer to rent to employers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal directly with performers . As you refine your show , pay special attention to the way lighting may be used to complement its format and content . It may be that a strobe would help get the au-dience 's attention when you open your show or wish to highlight some choreographed movement within the show . A color change , say from white to blue lighting , might be used to create a softer mood or a release from // the tension of one of the show 's peaks that employed mostly reds . If special lighting is a main feature of your show and you find the equipment you need is not generally available at the places you play , look for portable lighting equipment you can afford . It should be sturdy , safe , and simple to operate , and fulfill the lighting requirements for your show . Be careful not to overdo your lighting . Excessive color changes or overuse of strobe or similar effects tends to be disquieting and distracting to an audience . One advantage of having your own lighting equipment is that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't have someone to operate the lights for you , an electrician could wire them so that they can be operated from the stage by one of the performers using a foot switch . Inexpensive and interesting effects may be achieved by connecting some of the lights to the output of an amplifier or other electrical instrument used in the performance . With a foot switch to activate them , variable lighting effects may be achieved with colored lights that change in intensity with the volume from the output or instrument . Special effects may include use of props , smoke machines , lasar beam generators , slides or film , sound effect equipment , or other mechanical devices which aid in highlighting a show . A note of caution : Beware of gimmickry . Special effects should be utilized sparingly and tastefully . A quick check of the telephone directory under Theatrical Equipment and Supplies can provide a list of companies which specialize in lighting and special effects . If you call or visit , they can give you information about services , prices , and available equipment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set you apart from the competition and make your show a winner . // STAGING Staging is the way you utilize the area you have to perform in . This includes the way you set up and arrange your equipment and musicians , and your use of props . Knowing the size of the performing area is very important when you preplan the staging of your show . Whatever the size of this area , always make sure that each member of the performing unit can see and hear all others . The director should always be in clear view of everyone on stage . SOUND BLENDING Since sound travels in a straight line , the placement of your equipment and amplifiers is extremely important . The sounds should blend , all elements balanced relative to each other . Proper staging will help your sound tremendously . A workable arrangement lends itself to expansion when you have a large performing area and contraction when the area is smaller . A popular arrangement using a lead guitar , bass guitar , drums , electric piano , and a couple of microphones could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called " the expandable U. " It may be expanded when there is a large performing area , or contracted when the performing area is more limited . The drum and bass amplifier , which together establish the basic rhythmic pulse , should be placed near the center . The lead guitar amplifier is located slightly behind the drummer . This arrangement encourages a tighter rhythm section . The bass player , the drummer , and the lead guitar player can hear each other clearly . The electric piano is placed at an angle so that it can be heard by the other instrumentals as well as by vocalists or soloists who are at the mikes . The expandable U enables all the instrumentalists to see as well as hear each other . Guitar and bass amps are generally powerful enough not to need further amplification . This is not always the case with organ or piano amps . Most often these require additional amplification , generally being miked through the p.a. system . The speaker columns are placed in front of the micro-phones , cutting down undesirable feedback . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the p.a. system . A good sound balance rarely happens accidentally . Someone must adjust the sound system so that all the elements ? amplifiers , drums , vocalists , etc. ? blend into the sound you want . This means you must be able to hear the total sound as the audience hears . The best place to do this is the front of the performing area . The sound mixer can adjust only what 's amplified through the sound // system . Prearranged signals should be worked out with guitarists , drummer , or bass player so they can make the necessary adjustments the mixer requires to achieve an overall balanced sound . It is a good idea to arrive at an engagement early enough to determine the best arrangement for the equipment and test the acoustics of the location so that the best sound balance between all the performing elements can be determined . Remember , this is a relative sound balance and minor adjustments may be required when the audience 11 is present . With the powerful amplifiers and electronic equipment used today , care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volume . A sound that is clear , well-balanced , and comfortably audible to the entire audience is really what you 're after . When you can consistently achieve the proper sound balance for the locations where you perform , you are well on the way to being a true professional . CHAPTER IV Equipment Good equipment is an important asset to any performing artist who is seriously interested in pursuing a career in today 's music industry . Often , the equipment is what distinguishes the pros from the amateurs . In planning for success as a performer , be constantly aware of the role of equipment in the way you sound , look , and function . Ten important points to consider about equipment are : Cost and financing Reputation among other performers and professionals Durability and maintenance requirements Ease of transport The equipment 's appearance and its effect on your image Overall contribution in executing your performance Versatility and special features Its potential for expansion through additions or accessories Resale and trade-in value Warranties and guarantees What is the minimum equipment you need to perform ? How much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , well-maintained equipment is absolutely essential for successful performances . Choosing the proper 78 // equipment , therefore , is very important and should be done carefully . Each musician in your unit will need an instrument , in addition to amplifiers , cords , or other equipment which will help the instrument deliver the sound you want . A primary consideration is the contribution a piece of equipment makes to the total sound ? weighed against its cost . In addition to performer 's individual instruments and related equipment , you will need certain equipment for use by the entire unit , such as sound system , monitors , and special lighting . Be practical in assessing your priorities and eliminate items of limited use until you can afford them . To determine which equipment is within your budget and will consistently produce a good sound , visit local musical stores and check what they have available . Shop around and get some literature from the stores or manufacturers and study it . Many salesmen in music stores are themselves artists who can give you valuable help in comparing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warranties , ease of transport , repairs and service , or special features which make the equipment a good buy . Be sure to get a clear understanding of an item 's compatibility with other equipment you plan to add in the future . Speak to other performers , musicians , repairmen , or people whose experience or expertise may be invaluable in getting the best equipment for your requirements with the money you have available . In the long run it is generally best to stick with reputable brand names which often have a full line of accessories and products compatible or easily interchanged with the equipment you plan to use . You pay more for brand-name equipment , but the additional cost is well worthwhile in terms of its reliability , proven durability , quick service , part replacement and repairs , and its resale value . // There are wholesale outlets which sell equipment at discounts of 10 to 30 percent off list price . You may find these in the telephone directory under Musician Instruments Wholesale and Manufacturers . Little-known wholesale outfits , often specializing in particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the like , may be located through musicians , managers , or others who purchase equipment . Most of the trade magazines and publications of special interest to the music industry are used by wholesalers , retailers , musicians , or others who wish to advertise equipment for sale , exchange , or rent . RENT VS . PURCHASE Although most of the equipment you need may be rented or leased , in the long run it is better to purchase your own . When you rent , you will usually be required to leave a cash deposit as large as 25 to 50 percent of the equipment 's retail price . In addition , you must pay for the time you keep it . Renting equipment should be a last resort arising out of a special situation . Since you will probably get different equipment each time you rent , it is extremely difficult to become completely comfortable performing with rented items . If you intend to perform regularly , getting your own equipment should be one of your first priorities . NEW VS . USED The main advantages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top shape and guaranteed to work . // You can register the equipment and get a warranty against hidden defects or malfunctions . Repairs for defects or malfunctions are done free for the period of this warranty . It can usually be financed . New equipment has all the latest features and technical developments . It looks better because it is new . New equipment usually has a higher resale value . When buying new equipment deal with reputable merchants who will be there if you have a problem later . Established stores or outlets value your business and their reputation for quality and service . Study the literature on new equipment and make comparisons which will help you pick the best equipment for your needs . Do n't be floored by slick advertisements and gadgetry . Be sure that whatever new equipment you buy can be repaired or serviced just about anywhere . Beware of " fly-bynight " brands that are here today and gone tomorrow . Manufacturers of well-known brands with a proven track record make every effort to assure that their products are of top quality . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you may save money in the long run . One of the largest investments you will ever make will be for equipment . When you buy it new , you know what you are getting from the start . Proper care and maintenance should keep it in good working order , thus protecting this investment and increasing the trade-in and resale value . There are ways to save money even when buying new equipment . For example , compare prices and catch the sales , check discount and wholesale outlets , or purchase demonstrator or floor models . Used equipment that is in good condition and well maintained can function as well // as or better then new equipment . However , before buying used equipment you should have it checked out thoroughly by a competent repairman or someone familiar with the item and its parts . This can sometimes be a hassle , but it 's for your own protection . Do n't purchase any used equipment from a seller unwilling to let you check it out before you make a commitment . Some things to check when considering used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battered ? Covers or handles missing ? This usually indicates that the prior owner did not take good care of the equipment . If the equipment is dirty , dusty , or corroded inside , it indicates the lack of regular inspection and proper maintenance . Whether all the parts are included and in good working order . Items may be " conveniently missing " to disguise a defect in the operation of the equipment . The age of the equipment and its trade-in or resale value . Try to determine a little about its prior use . is the equipment stolen ? To protect yourself , insist upon a bill of sale for your purchase . When dealing with individuals , try to get a copy of the bill of sale or a statement signed by the seller indicating where , when , and from whom the equipment was purchased and why there is no original bill of sale . Every bill of sale must include the serial number and description of all equipment purchased . These documents are necessary to prove ownership and get insurance . The provisions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whether the equipment can be easily repaired or serviced . // If the price is actually a bargain . Check the list price and wholesale price of the equipment new . How does it compare with similar used equipment ? If used equipment does what you want it to do and you 're satisfied in light of most of the checks above , it can prove to be a genuine bargain and serve you well . WARRANTIES AND BILLS OF SALE When you purchase new equipment , immediately complete the registration forms necessary for warranty protection . During the period of the warranty , if there is a mechanical defect or malfunction , the manufacturer will repair the equipment at no cost to you . If you 're buying used equipment , check what warranties are in effect and passed on to you as the new owner . If the warranty has expired , the seller may give a limited warranty that the equipment will function properly . Stores that sell used equipment often give 30- to 90-day warranties . A bill of sale is the evidence that you own the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list all serial and model numbers . Be sure to compare the serial numbers on your bill of sale with the ones on the items you are purchasing . Make copies of your bills of sales and keep the originals on file in a safe place . This is especially important when you file your tax forms . As a professional musician the cost of equipment may be tax deductible . The bill of sale is evidence of what you spent for equipment . INSURANCE Insurance is the way to protect yourself against loss or theft of equipment . Prepare a list of all your equipment // which shows the date of purchase and briefly describes each item and its serial and model numbers . You 'll need this list and copies of bills of sales to apply for insurance . Most insurance companies will not insure your equipment . However , a few major companies specialize in this coverage . Consult the musician 's union in your area for information about companies with which their members may deal . Coverage may be available under a homeowner 's policy . Find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insurance company . Pay special attention to any limitations of coverage and how much the company actually pays for loss or theft . Most policies contain a $50 to $100 deductible clause which states the amount of loss not covered by the insurance . Insurance rates vary according to the value of the equipment and other factors , such as how and where you use or move it . Rates average from 10 to 20 percent a year based on the equipment 's total value . Insurance may seem like too much of a hassle , too costly , or even unnecessary , but once you have to replace lost or stolen equipment , it quickly proves its value . Make a definite place in your operating budget for insurance . Keep records of all insurance payments since these may be tax deductible . Shop around for the best policy and get cost estimates from as many insurance brokers as possible . TRANSPORTATION Equipment is most often damaged when it is moved . Handle each item carefully . All instruments should be in sturdy cases which fasten properly . Amplifiers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you pack and move them . Small items , // such as extension cords , speaker cables , microphones and mike stands , fuses , spare parts , and the like , should be kept together . A sturdy footlocker may be just the thing . A hand truck and dollies are inexpensive and useful for handling bulky or heavy equipment . When you move equipment in a truck or van , be sure to balance and distribute the weight . Heavy or bulky items should be packed first and tied down so they wo n't slide around and be damaged . The lighter items can then be packed on top . If you have to move equipment on public carriers , such as airlines , trains , and buses , everything must be packed in cases or containers that will survive the roughest handling . Inquire about insurance available at no charge through the carrier . If this is not enough to cover possible losses , get additional coverage . If something gets damaged the carriers prefer to repair , rather than replace , the damaged item . Your name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It should be clearly visible and difficult to remove . It 's a good idea to paint or stencil this identifying information on all cases , containers , and instruments . AMPLIFIERS Amplifiers boost the sound signals that come from an instrument or device . It consists of two parts : ( 1 ) a chassis , containing the circuitry which magnifies and reproduces the input signal ; and ( 2 ) the speakers , which convert the magnified signals to audible sound . The output of an amp is a measure of the extent the input can be magnified . Most performing units need guitar , bass guitar , and organ or electric piano amplifiers . Each amplifier should be capable of undistorted reproduction through the range // of the instrument . It must be capable of producing enough power so that its capacity is not strained in producing sufficient sound of good quality for the type of locations in which you expect to perform . Some factors to be considered when selecting an amp are : Where you expect to use it . Will you use it indoors or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , supper clubs , etc ? Be realistic in assessing your amplifier requirements . Think about where you will actually be performing over the next two years , for example . What instrument will be used with the amplifer . Each instrument operates within certain frequency ranges . Different amplifiers accommodate these ranges and produce the best sound for particular instruments . For example , the bass guitar sounds fullest with an amplifier which has large speakers ( 12 to 15 inches ) that respond best to the low frequency range of the bass . A lead guitar amp often has additional features , such as reverberation and tremolo . Electric pianos and organs require amplifers with a frequency range that goes from the low frequency response of the bass guitar amp through the higher frequencies of the lead guitar amp . An amp may be damaged by using it with the wrong instrument . A bass guitar consistently played through a lead guitar amp , for instance , will shortly destroy that amp 's speakers . For home practice , output power is n't so important . A small 30-watt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It can produce the same good sound as a larger amp when you use it at the same low volume level . However , when you 're performing together with other instruments in clubs or halls , amplifier output is // critical . An amp with higher output will serve you better and may prove cheaper because of fewer repairs caused by overloading or excessive strain . An amp with 100-watt output and at least two 15-inch speakers will be adequate for most places you perform in . The wattage stamped on the amplifier itself by the manufacturer is the amount of current the amplifier draws for operation . This is not the same as the output wattage , or power . This is usually lower , depending on the efficiency and characteristics of the amplifier circuitry . The best way to determine the amp 's maximum output is to test it and find the highest sound volume that can be obtained without distortion . Make this test yourself . Plug your instrument into the amplifier and play . Increase the volume level as you play until you hear the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highest volume at which the amp may be used continuously . Use this test to compare amps and find the one best suited to your needs . Make tone comparisons by testing the amp with its volume controls set at one-half the maximum output volume . Vary the bass and treble throughout the range of your instrument . The amp should reproduce a good tone through the entire range of your instrument . Most amps manufactured today have solid-state circuitry . They are lighter , produce less heat , are less fragile than tube amps , and generally require less service . Once you have the amps you need , the following simple procedures will prolong their useful life and keep them functioning at their peak . Do n't overdrive an amp . Continuous operation at , or above , the maximum output volume determined above will result in excessive breakdowns and repairs . // Do n't overload the amp by plugging too many instruments into it . An amplifier performs best with a single input . Adding others increases the amount of distortion by overburdening its circuitry . Regularly check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of output power . If you constantly have to turn up your volume to be heard , a faulty transistor or tube may be the reason . Have the amp checked as soon as possible . Otherwise , continued use , especially at higher volumes , will put a strain on the other tubes or transistors and often lead to a major repair job . Test the speakers in the amp to be sure they are all working . Operating the amp when one speaker is n't working can seriously damage it . THE SOUND SYSTEM The basic sound system , often called a p.a. system , consists of an amplifier and speakers . The amplifier , sometimes referred to as the head or brain , has multiple input capacity , volume and tone controls , reverb features , frequency filters , and multiple output terminals . The most advanced models have volume , tone , and reverb controls for each input or channel . The sound system speakers are mounted in separate units or columns . Each of these units contains an assortment of speakers which vary in size and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " tweeters . " They 're connected to the output terminals of the amplifier by speaker cables . The sound system , used properly , permits you to control the overall sound . It blends sounds from amplified instruments being played with nonamplified instruments // and vocalists to achieve a thoroughly well-blended overall sound that can be clearly heard by everyone in the audience . Choosing the sound system you will use should be done carefully and intelligently . Your choice of sound system will be influenced by : The output power of individual instrument amplifiers . These must not dominate your overall sound . Your sound system must be powerful enough to match the maximum output from the combination of the other amplifiers . The effectiveness of feedback controls . Individual input controls for adjusting separate volume , tone , and reverberation levels . Actual output power of the unit . Quality , durability , and price of the system . The possibility of expanding the sound system through the addition of more speakers , power boosters , and other accessories . Provisions for adding sound monitors which help the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things must be amplified to get the sound mixture you want . Consider what you plan to add in the future that may also need amplification . This way you will select a system with the capacity for future growth and increased usefulness . The sound system is so important that it is foolish to cut corners . Do n't compromise . Make sure the system you choose has enough inputs and sufficient power to deliver a good sound on the types of engagements you will probably play . Feedback Control Feedback controls are , basically , frequency filters . Activating these controls has the effect of filtering out // whatever frequencies may be causing the feedback problem . With any sound system , feedback is a common problem . The system you buy should have feedback controls which effectively eliminate this problem under most circumstances . To test the feedback controls , connect the sound system , adjust one of the microphone inputs to a medium level , then move the mike around the system 's speakers . When you hear the first hum of feedback , adjust the feedback @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by placing the sound system speaker units slightly in front of the microphones being used . Since sound is directional , this placement means that the sound goes directly out to the audience , with very little of it reentering the microphones of the sound system . Monitors Monitors are special speakers that enable the performers to hear what 's coming out of the sound system . They are placed in front , or to the side , of the unit so the performers can hear the sound the audience hears . Vocalists rely on monitors to help them stay in tune and in adjusting their volume . Microphones Microphones pick up the initial sound to be amplified by the sound system . They are a very important part of the system itself . There are many types of microphones and each has special features or capacities . The microphones best suited for your purposes should be selected on the basis of who will use them ? for example , will they be used to amplify a voice , the congas , or the output from another amplifier . // There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Each of these has certain properties . Cartoid mikes tend to be very directional . They can be adjusted to accept sound coming from one direction only . These mikes accept sounds from a particular direction while filtering out those coming from other directions . This feature can be very valuable . Using this type of mike can help eliminate feedback problems , especially when the system 's speakers are not in front of performers or microphones . Cartoid mikes are most commonly used with sound systems since they are very sturdy , and suited to the rigors of performing and traveling . Membrane microphones produce a broader , richer tone than cartoid mikes , but they are very delicate . They are not very directional and may cause feedback problems . Rarely chosen for use in ordinary sound systems , they are mainly used in recording studios . Microphones differ according to their frequency response . Some are better for middle-range or vocal frequencies . Others are better for higher or extremely low frequencies . Consider what you expect to amplify with any given microphone and how it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to choose the best ones for your sound . In the final analysis , the sound system is a combination of the head , or amplification unit , the input microphones , and the output speakers . All these elements must be compatible with each other and with other amplifiers used with the sound system . For increased sound coverage , you should be able to add more amplifiers to your basic system without extensive wiring changes . Connecting additional amplifiers in series with the original amplifier will increase or boost your output power . You should also be able to add additional speakers to your basic // system to increase the sound coverage . Additional speakers are very useful for proper sound coverage in oddshaped rooms . Helpful Hints Regarding Sound Systems All speakers should be connected to the amplifier before turning on the sound system . In an emergency , when one of the instrument amplifiers stops functioning , the affected instrument can be plugged directly into the sound system so that the performance can continue to be heard . Be sure to check the input when plugging instruments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ switch on the input to change from microphone to instrument input . When you need more microphones , special mike mixers increase the number of inputs available . To get the best sound from your system , someone should be thoroughly trained to monitor the sound and make necessary adjustments of the amplifier controls . Spare Parts and Repairs It seems that equipment only breaks down in the middle of a performance . True professionals are always prepared to handle ordinary breakdowns of their equipment ; a minor breakdown should never stop your show . All performers should know which things are most likely to break down on their equipment and be prepared with spare parts and tools to make quick repairs that wo n't interfere with their performance . For amplifiers and most electrical equipment , spare fuses and extra indicator lights are a must . Check the fuse sizes used in all equipment . It is a good idea to tape spare fuses for each amplifier inside its case for quick // fuse replacement . A burned-out indicator light will not stop the equipment from functioning , but should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or four extra sets of sticks and at least an extra snare drum head . A spare bass foot pedal and bass drum head may also come in handy . Broken guitar strings plague guitarists . Keep a full set of strings and extra packages of the thinner strings ( G , B , and E strings ) . The connector cords from the guitar to the amplifier can also break and will require immediate replacement . Extra connector cords should be kept close at hand . Some of the gadgets used by contemporary guitarists , such as fuzz boxes , wow wow pedals , tone benders , and the like , break down frequently . The battery that operates these devices is most often at fault . With extra batteries , it is easy to make replacements . Test all batteries periodically since they tend to lose power with age . Like any amplifier , the sound system requires fuses . Pay particular attention to the size and type of fuses in your sound system since more than one size may be used . Tape spares of all required sizes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of speaker cable extensions will give you more versatility in speaker unit placement . Extra speaker and monitor cables are extremely essential since the sound system itself may be damaged if one of its speakers is not working . One or two extra mikes , and at least two extra mike cords , will get you through most emergencies involving the sound system . If you have an available input to your sound system , an extra mike and cord can be connected to it . Adjust its volume to a level comparable to your other microphones . Then switch it off to avoid feedback . If one of your mikes goes out , simply turn on the extra // mike and make a quick substitution . A mike failure should present no problem at all , if you are prepared with an extra one . Electric pianos , organs , and synthesizers require special cables and connectors . These may be difficult to obtain readily , and , often , are not sold separately from the instrument . You may have to order them from the manufacturer . Order extras @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep spare fuses handy for these keyboard instruments . Most good mike , guitar , and extension cords can be repaired cheaply and easily . Avoid buying cheap , molded cords as they can not be repaired . When something is not working right , repair it immediately ; it can only get worse . If you really know what you 're doing , you can save time and money by making your own repairs . The manufacturer will repair most equipment if it is still under warranty . These repairs always take time . If you ca n't wait , find a qualified repair service that will handle your problem quickly . Check to see whether repairs by unauthorized repair services affect the terms of your warranty . Some repair services can loan you comparable equipment while yours is being fixed . When you perform , spare parts should be kept either onstage or nearby . If something goes wrong you can quickly correct it if you do n't have to run around looking for replacement parts you need . Planning for the unexpected is part of being a professional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to overcome all minor problems and proceed with your show . // EQUIPMENT CONTROL SYSTEM A constant problem for most performers is keeping up with their equipment . The best way to overcome this problem is to use a system of equipment control that always lets you know where any piece of equipment is . To protect your investment in equipment , the following system for equipment control will keep your losses at a minimum . Determine who is responsible for keeping up with the equipment . Is it your manager , a road manager , or a member of the performing unit ? Starting with the list of equipment you prepared for insurance purposes , add every item that you use in your show . Prepare a master control sheet which includes the number and description of each item with a space for checking the item off and for remarks indicating needed repairs , fuses , special connections , or other information . Make photocopies for use and file the original . Put a number on each piece of equipment . It does n't matter whether you 're numbering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relatively unimpor-tant item . These identifying numbers may be painted on or you may attach stick-ons . The im-portant thing is that these numbers are easy to read , durable , and hard to remove . Most stationery and hardware stores sell self-sticking numbers which may be ideal for this . The master control sheet should have your item num-ber , a description of the item , and some space provided to tell you where the item is. // Master Control Sheet A useful control sheet may be constructed like this : Columns A and B will be a complete listing of all equipment with corresponding item numbers . Columns C through F should be left blank until you move the equipment . Column G is where you list equipment out for repairs , on loan , or which is the special responsibility of one of the performers . When you 're moving the equipment to an engagement , as you load , make a check mark opposite each item in the column marked " Date Out , " completing the date as // indicated on the form . A short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be entered in Column G. After you complete the engagement each item should once again be checked off as it is loaded into your truck or van for transport back home or to your next engagement . These checks could be entered in columns D or F. If equipment is missing for repair or for some other reason , some comment should be entered in column G. The master control sheet may be used to check the equipment at an engagement . It should be complete and up-to-date and let you know at a glance where every item of equipment is and what is necessary to keep it functioning properly . If yours is a unit where individual members have a lot of specialized equipment , it is a good practice to make each individual responsible for the care and maintenance of personal equipment . When the unit begins to perform regularly or goes out on tour , it will be necessary to have an assistant or road manager who knows how everything works as well as when and where to make replacements , repairs , or additions to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and organization which were so important in developing your show are equally applicable to finding engagements . Your show was planned with a prospective audience in mind and you will want to get engagements which permit you to perform for them and get paid for it . One of the main objectives for performers is to consistently get jobs that pay well . In the beginning , such gigs are usually very hard to find . Most artists starting out have no idea where or how to look . The information and ideas explored in this chapter should give valuable insight into planning for and finding engagements . PREPARING FOR ENGAGEMENTS After your show is perfected and you begin to seek engagements , a lot of time and effort can be saved if you use the right tools and approaches . You will need persistence , a portfolio with pictures , information about you and your show , and good records , demos , or tapes which showcase your talent . You will also need information about where jobs are and how to get them . Plan to have the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portfolio is a very strong selling tool which will make finding engagements much simpler . The portfolio should include promotional pictures , a biography and resume , a demonstration tape or record , newspaper and magazine reviews , special advertisements which contain the performer 's name or picture , and a couple of business cards to enable prospective employers to contact you . Biography The bio should be a few short paragraphs giving information about the performer 's background that includes name , hometown , and special training or awards . If yours is a unit , it will also tell how long you 've been together , the unit 's instrumentation , size , and basic musical orientation ( top 40 , jazz , rock , etc . ) . If members of the unit have worked or performed with famous stars , mention this . The bio should be accurate and concise ; do n't waste words or include unrelated information . Resume This is a listing of engagements you have played , especially at well-known places . If an engagement went particularly well , you can include the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll give you a good recommendation . You might also note exceptional attendance figures , other performers on the show , and include reviews . Give accurate information about important engagements you will definitely be playing and mention recordings you have made , including the name of the record and the label it was recorded for . Prospective employers often check the information in // your bio and resume , so be truthful . Try to limit the Bio/ Resume to one or two double-spaced typed pages . Demonstration Tape or Record The demo is an important part of your portfolio . It is your calling card , so to speak , and one of your main assets . Generally , if prospective employers are disappointed with your demo , you probably wo n't get the job . This applies to engagements , recordings , and just about anything else a performer may do in the music business . Use all the principles of preplanning to make a demo that 's well recorded , with all lyrics and solo parts easily understandable and each element properly balanced relative to the others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used as your demo . A demo tape should give a prospective employer a good idea of how you really sound . It may contain recordings of live performances or of rehearsals in your studio . Recording the demo at a professional studio will cost you a lot of money . In a professional studio the engineer can modify the sound and balance each musical element for greater control over the final sound . Using home equipment the performers themselves must experiment , balance , and adjust their performance to compensate for the machine 's lack of control over individual sound levels . ( For more information about using professional studios to make a demo , see Chapter IlI . ) A demo should be a carefully planned mini-show , using the principles of tension and release discussed in Chapter IV . The opening , middle , and closing segments should follow a format . The main objective is to create a demo that sounds good and is representative of your show and your talents . Preplan your demo so you can submit it to secure many types of engagements . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demos . The // purpose of the demo is to convince a prospective employer that you will please an audience and be good for business . Selection of the material on your demo should be made with this in mind . Limit demo tapes to ten to fifteen minutes unless a specific amount of time is requested . In ten or fifteen minutes , you can do three or four of your best numbers that show the full range of your talent and versatility . Format these selections so that your mini-show will be effective and help you get engagements . If you 're just gettting started , or do n't have the money to pay for a professional studio , demos of acceptable quality can be made using a good 2-track home tape recorder . When making demos on your own , the following information will help you get the best sound from available equipment at minimum cost . Find a quiet place to record . Home tape units pick up background noises that can make your demo sound unprofessional . An area with rugs , heavy drapes , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the background sound and reverberation . Have someone who operates the equipment expertly monitor the recording . The performers should be free to concentrate on playing well and achieving a good blend for a well-balanced sound . If there are two or three elements such as guitar , vocals , piano , but no drum set or other large percussion instruments , a home unit 's two available mikes should be sufficient to obtain a well-balanced recording . By adjusting their volumes and distances from the mikes , the performers can find a balance that will produce a clear-sounding demo . If other elements are to be recorded , an inexpensive 4- or 6-mike mixer will permit greater indepen- // dence in balancing these elements for good recorded sound . When using the mike mixer , separation and placement of the various elements to be recorded is the key to get the best sound from this equipment . A tape recorder with the sound-on-sound feature permits recording additional elements by overdubbing . One or two overdubs can usually be made before the hiss or tape noise level gets too loud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elements . Using one machine to play a tape of previously recorded elements , you can record this , blended with a live overdub , onto the tape of the other machine . This two-machine overdub process may be repeated four or five times before there is a noticeable loss in the quality of the recording . Promotional Pictures Promotional pictures should be functional . Clear 8 x 10 inch black-and-white photographs are best for reproduction in most newspapers and magazines . Pay special attention to the composition and background . An interesting but simple pose against a plain light background generally results in the most useful promotional pictures . Choose a photographer experienced in making theatrical pictures . Professional theatrical photographers are aware of contrast , lighting , sharpness , and other qualities necessary for good reproduction . Everyone in the picture should be clearly visible , have a pleasant expression , graceful posture , and wear costumes in line with the image you want to project . Once you 've selected the best photograph among the photographer 's proofs , it can be retouched to remove any minor flaws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's name , record affiliation , agent or manager 's // name , address , and a contact number . A printer can help you select type faces and sizes to make the captions readable and interesting . An 8 x 10 inch master negative , including the picture with caption , can be prepared by a photographic reproduction outfit . Once you have a master negative , copies may be made easily . Most performers order copies in batches of at least 100 . A good color photograph may be included in your portfolio as an extra attention-getter . Color copies are expensive and do not reproduce well in most newspapers and magazines that are printed in black and white . They do , however , add another dimension to your portfolio . Newspaper , Magazine , and Other Reviews Reviews add class and credibility to your portfolio . Whenever anything is written about your show , make a note of the name of the publication and the date the article appeared . Obtain four or five copies of the publication for your files . Make copies of outstanding reviews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting started or have n't saved your reviews , make serious efforts to contact newspapers and magazines whenever you perform and ask them to send someone to review you show . Do n't wait until the last minute to contact the press . Give them at least a week 's notice before a performance you want them to review . A visit to their office with a copy of your bio , resume and picture is a good idea . It may arouse their interest and get them out to see your performance . In many cities there are magazines and circulars which tell what is currently going on around the area . These are often distributed in nightclubs , hotels , newsstands , and the like . Such publications are often willing and eager to write a review of one of your dynamite shows , or list where you 'll be appearing . // The key to getting free publicity and reviews is legwork , persistence and imagination . Phone calls are rarely effective . Letters are better , but personal contact usually produces results . You may know someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help you for free . If you can afford it , you can hire someone to handle your public relations . Invite music reviewers from daily , college , or underground newspapers and publications to catch your show . Write or telephone TV and radio stations . Request a live interview or offer to do a live broadcast or TV appearance . Invite program directors , DJ 's , reviewers , concert promoters , and bookers to your show if there is a possibility of getting a job or a story , picture , or review in the media . No matter what the occasion , artists should be on time , appropriately dressed , with a cooperative attitude and good manners . Remember , people are more likely to write favorably about you , play your records , or do something " extra " for you if they have met and talked with you , liked your show , personal manner , deportment , seriousness , and attitude . Think ahead . Publicity and public appearances form a necessary part of the professional 's success . When a reporter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you should know exactly how to reply . Your information should be accurate and truthful ? and not boring . It is a good idea to practice by determining what you 'd like to know if you were conducting the interview , meeting the artist , or asking questions . Special Advertising Whenever a performer 's name appears in any type of advertisement , copies should be filed for possible use in the portfolio . Posters or other large advertisements may // be photographed for the portfolio and printed in a usable size . Business cards provide a reliable , quick way for you to be contacted . SETTING A PRICE When you make the rounds with your portfolio , it is important to know how much to charge for an engagement . Once an employer is interested in hiring a show , one ofthe first questions will be : " How much does it cost ? " The price you set should cover your expenses , provide something to be set aside for future growth , and return a profit based on your popularity and reputation . Your expenses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be carefully worked out before you set your price . These expenses include : 1 . Payroll to members of the unit 2 . Transportation : Fares , car , truck , or trailer rentals , gas , tolls , etc. 3 . Food and lodging 4 . Equipment and instrument rental 5 . Fixed expenses : Union fees and insurance 6 . Capital return on money invested in the show 7 . Percentages due agents , managers and specialists 8 . The growth percentage or reserve Check applicable union wage scales and the going rate for units of your stature . Preplan your budget to determine the minimum amount for which you can work . As an example , there 's a three night engagement , two 40-minute shows a night , available to your six-piece unit if you can do the engagement at a reasonable price . Each performer agrees to work for $30 a night . To move your equipment , you will need a truck which rents for $20 a // day and a helper to load and unload equipment at $15 . The employer can arrange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Each person would provide for his own food . Union dues are $5 per night for the unit . An agent called you for the job , and the agent 's fee is 15 percent of the total engagement price . To date , $3,000 has been invested in the unit . This figure comes from your records detailing all expenses such as studio , costume or equipment purchase or rental . When you get paid for engagements , a specific amount should be earmarked for recovering this $3,000 capital investment . By keeping good records and documenting all expenditures , you can reduce your tax liability by claiming a certain portion of your income as a return on invested capital . A CPA can give you more detailed in-formation . In our example , 1 percent is allocated as return on invested capital . Ten percent of all expenses , including the return on invested capital is set aside to cover future growth expenditures such as new equipment purchases , repairs and maintenance , etc . Once you 've totaled all expenses and added the growth percentage , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due agents , managers , specialists ) . In our example , the expense budget would resemble Ta ble I. The break-even price for this engagement is $1,174 , or $384.00 per night . At the break-even point , you wo n't lose money on the engagement and you 'll make enough to set some aside for future growth while recouping part of the money already invested . Once you determine your break-even point , you know immediately whether you can take an engagement at the price offered by an employer . If you accept an engagement below your break-even point , there should be other reasons as important as the money . Before accepting any engagement below your break-even price , carefully analyze and determine whether playing such an engagement is important to your overall goals , and if the benefits you gain will be more valuable than the money you 'll be losing . A general rule would be to accept as few engagements as possible below your break-even price . Limit these to engagements which will // pay off in terms of prestige and future work when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carrying our example a step further : You can deter-mine the point at which you actually lose money on this engagement . Suppose the employer 's top offer is $750.00 . Analyze your expenses to determine which you can elim inate or reduce . Salaries should be one of the last things to reduce . However , you can save $15 by loading your own equip ment . Nothing can be cut from transportation expenses . A check with the hotel reveals that lodging expenses can not be reduced , but a special arrangement can be made with a nearby diner to feed all six of you for $30 a day , a reduction of $90 in food expenses . The agent 's fee must be paid , but on the basis of the $750 offer this now would be $75 instead of $117.40 . The areas where expenses could be reduced , and the preferred order in which to reduce them may be sum marized as in Table II . If you now look at your expense schedule , you will see that there is nothing else that can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engagement the per-formers would have to take a combined reduction of $150 in their salaries . THE BOTTOM LINE The bottom line is what it costs you to do the engagement when everybody performs without salary and all possible expenses are cut . In this example , the bottom line is calculated as follows : In other words , it will cost you $360 to get to the engagement , have a place to stay , and food to eat . To make it as a performer in the music business you should set up an expense schedule in order to set realistic prices that provide a mechanism which increases your longevity in the business . Since price negotiations are a basic part of securing // engagements , an expense schedule is an essential tool for weighing the value of any engagement . Using this schedule you 'll always know your profit or loss and the items to be eliminated or reduced . You will be able to quickly see how your price negotiations affect your future growth and success in the music business . FINDING ENGAGEMENTS Most performers get their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a devoted following that fills any place you play , you 'll generally be limited to engagements obtained through your own efforts . Booking agents prefer artists with experience and a record . Agents will often insist on seeing a live performance so that they can judge the show and the audience 's reaction . Obtaining those first engagements that build your reputation and a following will take research , preplanning , and a lot of hustle . There is no simple standard procedure for securing those first engagements . Sometimes it 's luck ; you 're in the right place at the right time . A fan or a friend may find one for you . Most engagements , however , are gotten when you learn where they are , make personal contact with a prospective employer and have the right tools to sell your show . Check local newspapers and magazines for advertisements of clubs , hotels , discos , etc. , which feature live entertainment . Contact the manager or someone in charge there to find out who handles the booking . Try to make an appointment where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitch ? pictures , bios , demos , and anything else in your portfolio which will increase your chances of securing the engagement . A personal visit has the advantage of adding your own enthusiasm and personality // to the impact made by your portfolio alone . The entire unit should not go to appointments for jobs . Regardless of the size of the unit only one or two people should go . Appoint someone neat and intelligent , possessing a pleasant personality and expertise in the music industry to represent your unit . You only need one authorized spokesman to negotiate the best price and sell your show to an employer . If you know someone who can introduce you to people who may hire you , take advantage of this opportunity ? it may help tremendously . Listen to local radio stations ; learn the names of the disc jockeys and the times they 're on the air . Make a visit to the station and speak to some of the DJ 's after their show . DJ 's often know what 's going on musically in the area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Many of them produce and emcee live shows . They are sometimes asked to recommend performers for affairs such as dances , community functions , special occasions , and the like . Record companies and promoters often rely on the DJ 's knowledge of local performers when seeking talent to appear on a show which features one of their major artists . DJ 's are very busy people , so make your presentation short and sweet . Show your portfolio and ask the DJ to listen to your demo . If you have an engagement in the area , extend an invitation . A DJ , who is enthusiastic about your show , may offer valuable information and introductions to employers . When you have a record this personal contact with DJ 's and radio stations can help to promote it . Local schools and colleges are another good source of engagements . Find out who is in charge of student activities and contact them personally . Show your portfolio and inquire about future affairs that will be using live entertainment . Schools and colleges tend to book per- // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you contact them in plenty of time . Plans for class socials , proms , balls , homecomings , and other special activities are often made six months or more in advance . The student activities office can put you in touch with fraternities and sororities which may hire your unit . Post your business card or other advertisement on bulletin boards in nearby shops or locations frequented by students . School-related engagements pay very well and help performers build a strong following . Clubs , hotels , and discos that feature live entertainment are always looking for performers with a good show . They may require a live audition . Sometimes the engagement may have to be booked through a specific booking agent . Many clubs and most hotels are union supervised . Nonunion performers may not be able to play in these locations . If you plan to play club and hotel engagements , join appropriate unions . Contact the places organizations rent for special occasions . The person handling rental of the facility may be cooperative and give you a list of organizations which have rented it for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organizations to see whether they have already contracted live entertainment for future functions . Get the name of someone in the organization you can invite to see your show when you perform in the area . Also , invite the person who books the hall out to see your show or to your rehearsal studio . This may result in recommendations for future bookings . Other sources to investigate would be nearby government installations and military bases , outdoor parks and park directors , professional associations , convention bureaus , prisons , hospitals , and activity centers. // AUDITIONS When seeking engagements , you may be asked to au-dition . If the job is worthwhile and advances your prog-ress toward your goals , by all means do the audition and do it well . Carefully consider what you may gain from the audition and weigh potential benefits against what it will cost to do . Both time and money are invested by performers in auditioning . Set up an expense budget for an audition as you would for any engagement . Calculate what the audition costs you in terms of dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepare , perfect and present it when determining whether the audition is worthwhile . The audition should be a carefully planned perfor-mance . Check with the employer about how long the audition should be . You can then apply the principles explained in Chapter V to prepare a show tailored to the requirements of the engagement you hope to get . Audi-tioning is serious business . It 's a good idea to develop a standard format which is flexible enough to be used for most auditions . The performance you give and the show you present should be your best effort . If costumes , props , or special effects are a feature of your show , use them in your audition if possible . Rehearse the show you plan to use for an audition until it is professional and runs smoothly from the time you begin to set up until the time you leave with the contract in your hand . Keep your setup time to a bare minimum and learn to tune up quickly so you can get right into the audition . Plan for the unexpected . Take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else that is really necessary to // insure your performance . Double check the time and location of the audition and get there early enough to have time to deal with any special situations that may arise . There are people in the music industry known for using auditions to get free entertainment with no real intention of hiring the performer . Some " talent nights " are a waste of time . Since auditions cost time and money , limit them to engagements you may realistically hope to obtain through auditioning . You can also occasionally negotiate for some form of reimbursement or other consideration that will reduce your audition expenses . For example , the employer may provide a truck to move your equipment , or feed everybody . The best results in seeking engagements are obtained through persistence , professionality , and ingenuity . The engagements you find on your own will give you valuable experience in performing and help you build a reputation that will interest booking agents and others . BOOKING AGENTS The primary function of a booking agent is to secure engagements , prepare engagement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The booking agent earns a commission . This is a percentage of the performer 's earnings for engagements . There are numerous agents who specialize in booking artists without a record ; the problem is finding them . A thorough search through the telephone directory will give a fairly complete listing of agents in your area . Booking agents are generally listed under Entertainment ? Agents ? Theatrical or Booking . In December of each year the leading music industry trade magazines ( Cashbox , Billboard , and Record World ) // publish annual issues with an extensive listing of booking agents , record companies , managers , music publishers , record manufacturers , and other trade-related businesses throughout the country . Copies may be purchased or ordered through newsstands or you can obtain these by writing directly to the publishers ( see the Appendix ) . The larger booking agencies are primarily interested in performers with a record that 's moving up the charts , or who have solid , established reputations . Whether or not you have a record , you should still contact these giants and make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act upon unsolicited portfolios mailed to them . Whenever you perform , always invite agents with whom you 've established personal contact . Tour places in your area that feature live entertainment . Speak with managers and ask for names and addresses of agents they know . You can do this while seeking an engagement for your show . Check with other performers and ask them about agents with whom they 've worked . The point is , search around . Check each agent 's reputation for effectiveness , honesty , and the type and extent of contacts and connections . There are agents who will be good for you and there are those who can waste your time . Avoid signing contracts for exclusive representation with an agent until you 're convinced he is the right agent for you . The agent 's contacts and expertise should be sufficient to carry you all the way to the top . With a hit record a performer may very quickly become popular . If an artist is signed to an exclusive contract with an agent who can not grow with this success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hamper achievement of his goals . If you expect to be signing with a record company in the near future , it may be wise to wait until you 've discussed the matter with the company . // Record companies deal with many reputable agents and may tell you how to get in touch with some of them . Booking Agent 's Commissions The standard commission for booking agents is 10 to 15 percent of the engagement price . This percentage is paid off the top , before anyone else is paid . Some agents authorize the employer to deduct the commission due them and pay the balance to performers or managers . Others collect the commission directly from performers or managers . Everyone concerned should have a clear understanding of how and when the agent 's commissions gets paid . Reputable agents collect their commissions only when you work and never require payment in advance to secure an engagement for you . They prepare signed contracts stating the engagement price , commission due , and all details of the engagement such as number and length of shows , show times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more complete information about engagement contracts , see Chapter IX . LOCKING UP THE ENGAGEMENT Once you and an employer have come to a verbal understanding about doing the engagement , put everything in writing . Engagement contracts are extremely important because they spell out the specifics ? money , schedule of payment , agent 's commission , number of shows , length of each show , duration of the engagement , and showtimes . It should also include all special provisions regarding food and lodging , travel allowances , equipment to be supplied or rented and who pays for it , deposits // and schedule of payments , and required promotional appearances or services . The engagement contract provided by the American Federation of Musicians , which you can obtain by contacting any union office , may be used , or you and your lawyer may prepare one of your own . A contract must specifically state all the points of agreement between the performer and the employer . Spelling everything out in the contract eliminates future problems and disagreements . Verbal promises and handshake agreements are difficult to enforce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or promoters . If the contract is the key to the engagement , the deposit is the lock and the schedule of payments is the oil that makes the lock work smoothly . A nonrefundable deposit or binder should be paid by the employer when the contract is signed . An employer who has paid a deposit will hesitate to cancel your show if , for example , a more popular group unexpectedly becomes available . This binding deposit ranges from 10 to 30 percent of the contract price . Some employers may balk at paying a deposit , but this binder protects you . In addition to an initial deposit , your contract may call for one third of the remainder to be paid when you arrive at the engagement , one third halfway through the engagement , and the balance to be paid before the last show . The schedule of payments provides the way you get paid over the course of the engagement . Suppose your contract calls for one-third of your money to be paid when you arrive at the engagement , one-third payable halfway through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last show . If the engagement is for $1,000 , with a 10 percent deposit , the scheduled payments would be as Table III . By scheduling the payments you attempt to get most , if not all , of your money before you finish the engagement . In working out a schedule of payments , keep in mind your schedule of expenses . This can eliminate the touchy problem of asking for advances . Be sure to keep copies of all contracts as a part of your permanent records . AVOIDING PROBLEMS AT ENGAGEMENTS The same professionalism and standards you use in executing your show should be maintained at all times during the engagement . The performer is in the public 's eye both on and offstage and should be aware at all times of appearance , conduct and attitude . Always be on time and keep to the performance schedule . The way you dress offstage should be consistent with the occasion . Sloppy or inappropriate dress often turns an employer off and causes problems . Part of becoming successful is taking special care in the way you dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's on engagements are drugs , ex- // cessive drinking , boisterousness and swearing , minors when not allowed , antagonism of the audience , or any behavior that is not in good taste or which violates general conduct codes . Over-enthusiastic fans or disorderly customers can be a problem while you 're performing . They may distract you or break your communication with the audience . In most cases , if you " keep your cool " and go on with your performance , the problem will take care of itself and the audience will understand . When it 's obvious that the problem wo n't go away you may have to deal with it on stage as tactfully as you can . Think about some of the common situations that may arise , and how you 'll handle them when they happen to you . Often you can turn the tables using a little humor . Be careful about putting anybody down since this might antagonize the audience . Think of the image you wish to project and handle these situations in accordance with that image . CHAPTER VI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or fame is the product , and the potential market spans the globe . The role of the manager is to oversee and guide the artist 's career . Good management is one of the essentials to the success of a performing artist . When there is the right combination of artist and management , everyone makes money . The full potential of the artist can only be realized through good management . To understand good management one must know what it is , what it requires , how it is done , and what its rewards are . The term " manager " usually refers to the personal manager who aids and guides an artist 's progress . The ideal manager knows how the industry functions , is honest , hard-working , creative , and loyal . The manager seeks artists who have these same qualities , plus a marketable talent or personality which appeals to the buying public . Good management requires a thorough knowledge of the music industry , contacts that will be beneficial to the artist 's success , and a belief in the artist 's creativity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationship . The manager must be willing to go the whole road , through good and bad times . This often means an investment of time and money in addition to hustle and creative imagination . A manager must be able to evaluate the full potential of the talent , consider the personalities involved , and determine what is needed and how long it will take to reach agreed goals . 120 // An overall plan for mutual success is the basis of the business partnership between the manager and the artist . Until the artist can afford other specialists , the personal manager does it all . The manager initiates job opportunities and chooses and supervises specialists who provide career services the artist needs to make it to the top . By directing and assisting these specialists , the manager aids artistic development and commercial exploitation of the artist 's talent and creative output . Before an artist makes it to the top , a support team of specialists will be needed . These specialists handle finances , make recommendations on engagements , and help plan and execute a strategy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the services of a road manager , business manager , booking agent , publicity agent , and other specialists may be needed to realize the career goals mapped out by the manager and the artist . Most successful managers know that it takes time to convert talent into dollars . Together , the manager and the artist must develop and be committed to a sound plan for growth which can be adequately financed with available resources . Each should have a clear understanding of their individual commitment of time , money , and talent to the venture . The manager 's creative input and direction is important to the success of the artist . By knowing as much as possible about the industry the manager can develop a strategy designed to make the relationship pay off . MANAGEMENT STRATEGY A manager should : Assess what the artist really has to offer . For example , is the artist 's talent in the performing area only , or in songwriting as well . // Determine the best markets for the artist 's total creative output and attributes . Contact and explore opportunities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weaknesses and formulate a plan to capitalize on the strengths and correct the weaknesses . Establish a time schedule for accomplishing specific goals in the overall plan . REQUIREMENTS OF MANAGEMENT In order to execute this strategy successfully the manager must : Have space or office facilities for the operation . Essential features include a telephone , mailing address , and a message-receiving center . Files , stationery , typing services , and business cards are required . Develop a fair , basic management contract flexible enough to handle modifications and special provisions required for individual artists . This contract should allow the manager enough time to execute the success plan and provide for adequate compensation for the manager 's investment of time , money , effort , and creativity . Seek the best recording deal for the artist . Managers rarely make money with artists who never make a record . A recording deal with a record company or producer which gives the artist the maximum number of releases and a fair share of the income from record sales is necessary . Make sure the company will promote the record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in planning the artist 's career . // Aid the artist in developing a good show . The manager supervises the setting up of rehearsal goals and schedules , acquiring necessary equipment , and makes recommendations as to repertoire , costumes , and the actual presentation of the show . Initiate contacts for jobs and appearances . See that appropriate unions are joined and dues kept current . Set up an adequate support organization and select career specialists to help improve earning ability and aid the artist in realizing career objectives . Have adequate financing to sustain the management operation until the artist makes money . HOW THE MANAGER MAKES MONEY A manager makes money by picking the right talent , guiding the artist 's development , and making the right deals for increased earnings . An artist with long-range potential , creative originality , and a positive attitude would be a prime candidate to interest a good manager . The manager is paid a percentage of the artist 's total earnings . This percentage varies from 10 to 50 percent of the artist 's gross income , with the usual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artist earns . The manager 's percentage comes off the top , before any other expenses are deducted . Some management contracts have provisions for percentages that escalate : The percentage is based on a graduated scale and varies with the artist 's earnings over some designated time period , such as weekly , monthly , or annually . For example , the contract may state that the manager is entitled to 15 percent of the first $1,000 per week , 20 percent of the next $2,000 , and 25 percent of everything over $3,000 earned in a week . // It should be clearly spelled out in the management contract with the artist whether money the manager spends on behalf of the artist is " money invested " or " money advanced . " If this is not clearly understood , there is sure to be conflict between the artist and the manager when money starts coming in . There have been many lawsuits where a manager tried to recoup " money advanced " while the artist claimed that money expended by the manager on the artist 's behalf was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recover all expenses incurred while working exclusively on behalf of , or at the artist 's request . If an expenditure is specifically requested by the artist , there 's no problem . The trouble starts when the manager spends money for things which , according to the manager 's best judgment , are necessary for the success of the artist . This may include charges for phone calls , money laid out for equipment , costumes , transportation , publicity and promotion material , or businessrelated entertainment . The contract should clearly detail which expenses are to be chargeable to the artist as monies advanced and those chargeable to the manager as monies invested . This could take the form of a provision stating that all expenses incurred on the artist 's behalf at the manager 's discretion are chargeable to the artist as advances , to be recouped before the artist is entitled to any income . This type of contract provision is heavily weighted in the manager 's favor . An unscrupulous manager could really have a ball at the expense of the artist . At the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the manager on the artist 's behalf must be specifically approved by the artist in advance before it may be charged against artist 's income . This definitely favors the artist , but is hardly a workable arrangement . // The most successful managers handle this potential problem area by negotiating a contract which realistically assesses expenditures necessary for the success of the partnership and fairly allocates them between management and the artist . For increased earnings , the manager seeks to charge most expenditures exclusively incurred on behalf of the artist as advances against artist 's income . These advances will be deducted from the artist 's income in addition to the contract percentage due the manager . MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT One of the main considerations in selecting an artist to manage is how much must be spent to put and keep the artist in a money-making situation . In negotiating with the artist the manager must decide whether to take the chance that , as a result of management 's skill and expertise , income earned will be great enough so that contract percentages due are large enough to recover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moneymaking situation and still be worthwhile as manager 's earned income . ADVANCES AGAINST FUTURE INCOME In their negotiations , the artist and manager must agree as to the amount or type of expenditures to be considered as advances against artist 's income . All other expenditures are , in effect , an investment , to be recouped from the manager 's own contract percentage . If the contract clearly spells this out , the manager always knows the current state of the financial involvement with an artist . The amount of money a manager makes // is strongly affected by the terms of the management contract as they relate to management expenditures . It may be that a portion of the income the manager receives from the contract percentage is a return of money invested rather than profit . Compare how much the manager gets under the terms of the following three contracts when the artist earns a gross of $10,000 a year . The manager has spent $5,000 on behalf of the artist to reach this level of earnings . $3,000 of the manager 's expenditures went for equipment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Provides that all expenditures made by the manager on the artist 's behalf are chargeable to the artist as advances . Contract 2 ? Provides that no expenditures made by the manager on the artist 's behalf are chargeable against artist 's income . These expenditures are to be recovered out of the manager 's contract percentage . Contract 3 ? Provides that no expenditures made by the manager on the artist 's behalf are chargeable to the artist 's income except expenditures for transportation , equipment and costume purchases . Table IV shows how the $10,000 gross income would be distributed according to the terms of each of these contracts . A manager must be keenly aware of what figure will be satisfactory compensation for expending the necessary time and effort to properly manage an artist . Having arrived at this figure , the manager can then adjust the amount to be invested and the contract percentage to be received so that it can be attained . To more clearly illustrate this point , suppose a manager has a three-year contract with an artist and considers $20,000 to be rea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the life of the contract . According to the assessment made , $100,000 is the projected total income , and $10,000 is required to put the artist in a position to earn this much projected income . If the entire $10,000 is chargeable as advances against artist 's income , the manager earns $20,000 on a contract percentage of at least 20 percent ( 20 percent of $100,000 = $20,000 ) . If the contract provides that only $5,000 of the money laid out may be charged to artist 's income , then the man ager 's contract percentage must be increased to at least 25 percent to give the manager the desired $20,000 return ( $25,000 minus $5,000 ) . Where the $10,000 is stated as the manager 's investment , none of which can be deducted from artist 's income , then the manager must receive at least 30 percent ( $30,000 ) since $10,000 of this $30,000 is a recoupment of the manager 's $10,000 investment . The point is , a manager must understand the relationship // between the contract percentage and the amount of time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these things affect management income . BIGGER MANAGEMENT INCOME When the artist makes more money , the manager makes more money . A good manager knows that increased earnings result from wide exposure that creates demand for the artist 's services or product . A creative manager will develop specific plans to increase public demand and completely market the full range of the artist 's talent and fame . If the artist possesses special talents or attributes , definite steps would be initiated to develop and market them . Specialists may be selected to help implement the manager 's plans . Management operations may be expanded to provide a more complete range of services . The expanded operation might include music publishing , record production , public relations , media exposure , and investment counseling . By providing a full range of services to the artist under the management operation , the middle man is often eliminated and management income increased . Creative managers have found the following to be useful in making and implementing plans to increase management income . Mailing Lists and Fan Clubs A mailing list can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearances , record releases , important stories or articles about the artist , and anything else that helps increase the artist 's fame or fortune . It 's an important way to create and expand a market for the artist . // Creating Engagements The manager and artist can agree to promote their own engagements , assuming all the risks , including the possibility of losing money . If the artist has sufficient drawing power and if sound plans to promote the show are made and carried out , then creating these engagements can be the thing that keeps the partnership going , makes money for everybody , and provides valuable experience and exposure . Copyright Exploitation If the artist is also a songwriter , the manager may seek to acquire an interest in the publishing rights to the artist 's songs . Management income is increased through recordings of these songs by the artist and through initiating deals with music publishers , record companies , and producers for others to record the songs . Lead sheets and demos of the artist 's original material would be submitted to get the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will require an additional investment of time , effort , and money from the manager . The rewards , however , may be greater income for both the manager and the artist/writer , as well as creating a calling card that opens doors for the artist at record companies . A first-rate demo of the original compositions of the artist is a real plus in the manager 's search for the right record deal for the artist . Videotape/Film A well-produced ten- to fifteen-minute videotape presentation that captures a top live performance by the artist is an excellent way to introduce the artist to top booking agents . It is a very effective selling tool for the lucrative college and concert circuit . A video presentation is very // helpful in obtaining television appearances for increased exposure for the artist and increased income for the partnership . Advertising agencies often screen talent for commercials by viewing videotapes . Using Specialists When the manager realistically assesses the artist 's full potential , it 's a wise move to consider specialists such as booking agents , business managers , road managers , accountants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manager 's plans to make money for the partnership . Market Analysis Explore the full variety of potential markets available to the artist . The music industry is worldwide and foreign markets should be explored . Often foreign engagements may be obtained which pay more than domestic ones . If the artist has a record , a foreign tour could introduce it to new markets for additional record sales . Foreign publishing deals can be initiated for additional exposure of the artist 's songs . Before signing the artist , the manager should determine how much money will be required to perform management functions successfully under the contract . As the saying goes , it takes money to make money . If artist management is what you want to do in the music business , be prepared to commit your own money or seek investors . If the money-making potential is good and the overall plan is sound , investors may be interested in investing in the management operation . Work closely with your lawyer to make sure that you and your artists are fully protected . // MANAGEMENT FROM THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today 's music business , most artists will sooner or later feel the need for outside help in planning and pursuing their career . This is the basic function of a manager . In most cases , good managers will not be interested in signing an artist until the artist clearly demonstrates a marketable talent . This means that the artist may have to put a show or audition together , find or write songs that may be recorded , and oversee the development of their artistic product to the point that it meets the competition and clearly demonstrates the capacity for future commercial growth . The manager , being in business , is chiefly interested in showing a profit on a minimum investment of time , effort , skills , and money . What to Look for in a Manager There are many people who profess to be managers . To get the right one , the artist must be able to evaluate what good management is . A few standards that may help in evaluating prospective managers are : The manager should be a full-time professional actively engaged in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hobby or as a part-time thing are rarely able to fully service and develop the artist . Whether the management operation has an office , staff , and telephone . If other artists are under contract , how are they making out ? If the manager has a good track record . This track record gives a good indication of the experience and skill a prospective manager brings to the part- // nership . What has been the manager 's level of success in the market you think you 're strongest in ? The manager should have a good reputation for honesty , fairness , hustle , creative direction , and contacts in the industry . The manager 's potential or ability to go all the way . Is the manager aware of the artist 's full potential and capable of making and executing plans to provide complete career services and guidance as the artist 's income and stature increases ? The management operation should be adequately financed . If not , does the manager have a definite plan to secure the financing required to put the artist in a position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relate to your career objectives and financial goals . The manager 's and artist 's personalities should be compatible . Can you work together with mutual respect and commitment ? The manager 's personal style , appearance , and mode of operation should inspire confidence . Whether the manager has enough time to adequately manage you . The manager is the artist 's exclusive manager , but the artist may not be the manager 's only artist . if these standards are used in evaluating prospective managers , the artist has a yardstick to help determine if a particular manager measures up . Managers to Avoid Just as there are standards for good management , there are characteristics of bad managers . Artists should shy away from managers who want them to sign a management contract without consulting a lawyer . Another type to be avoided are those who make extravagant promises // or guarantee immediate success . A professional manager who 's sincerely interested in signing you to a contract is aware of the competition and the odds for success and will work out a sound plan to reach reasonable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program to reach defined goals is hardly the one to take the artist all the way . Inexperienced managers have to work extra hard , learning the business while representing the artist . There may often be strategic mistakes made . If the artist and the manager combine their knowledge , develop a sound plan , and grow together , progress can be made . Beware of " hype " managers , a special breed who characteristically operate energetically to sell the artist piein-the-sky or immediate stardom . They buzz through rehearsals or engagements , often accompanied by assorted characters , each of whom is given some high-sounding title . A hype manager always has you believing that at least five top companies can hardly wait to sign you to a recording contract or take you on a high-paying tour . All these good things hinge upon signing a management contract immediately . It all happens so fast that an unwary artist gets caught up in the fantasy and starts signing everything . Remember , be realistic and honest with yourself . Do n't go on an ego trip when seeking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and professional advice , and weigh everything in terms of your overall plans . A hastily signed contract with a bad manager may waste as much as three years of your career , and few artists can afford to do that . Finding a Manager Artists getting started have a hard time reaching top managers . Because they 're so busy handling the affairs of the money-making artists they manage , they rarely have time to spend with new artists they do n't know . The // top managers receive a constant stream of unsolicited 1 demos and promotion material . However , this does n't mean not to send yours , but rather , send it only after you 've exhausted every avenue to get a personal interview . In a personal interview , your chances of gaining the interest of a particular manager are much better . Aided by a professional presentation and outstanding demos a manager may be favorably impressed and convinced of your potential . If all goes well , you may be offered a contract or referred , with a good recommendation , to some other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Each year the major trade magazines publish a listing of managers , agents , record companies , record producers , and others in the music industry throughout the country and abroad . A copy of the most recent ones may be ordered from the publishers . See the Appendix for names and addresses of the major trade publications . Another good source listed in the Appendix is the Official Talent and Booking Directory . There may be local managers who are capable of making the long haul to success with you . Speak with other artists , friends , or clubowners . Check the telephone directory under Theatrical Managers . Contact local disc jockeys who may give advice that will save time in locating a good manager since they are often in contact with artist 's managers and promoters . When considering a manager have a definite idea and time schedule for the goals you want to accomplish and how the manager can help you reach them . THE PARTNERSHIP ? THE RIGHT DEAL Sooner or later you will probably be offered a management contract . This document defines the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are form contracts that try to cover everything , and there are specialized contracts which are tailored to specific artists . Whatever contract you 're offered , consult a competent lawyer to negotiate the terms you want in your contract . It will be helpful to your lawyer if you understand the basic provisions of management contracts . Most management contracts provide for the following : The parties and their relationship . Who 's the manager and who 's the artist ? How many managers or artists are bound by the contract ? The reason for the contract and specific representations by the parties . The objectives to be accomplished and each party 's commitment and availability . The consideration . What is being given , paid , or exchanged to bring about a contract ? How will this consideration be apportioned and paid ? The length of the contract . What is the minimum period the contract runs ? Are there options or extensions ? If so , how are these executed and how do they affect other contract provisions ? Exclusivity of artist 's services , non-exclusivity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a management contract generally provides that the manager may handle other artists , but the artist may not have another manager . Problems can arise if a manager has signed more artists than can be handled properly . Ownership of name , trademark , and product . Who owns them and how are they transferred or retained ? What happens to them after the contract expires ? Advances , charges , and investments . How are expenditures allocated ? Are they advances or charges // against artist 's income or investments by the manager ? Are there provisions and procedures for recoupment ? Provisions for granting authority and stated limitations of power of attorney . To what extent is the manager authorized to legally bind the artist ? This may include entering contracts , making payments , salary decisions , debts , drawing checks , executing inter-bank drafts , and making commitments for the services of specialists . Personal authorization for discretionary use of artist 's name , likeness , pertinent or biographical information , etc . A method for arbitrating disputes . Provisions for breach of contract and remedies for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some of these provisions have become standard management practices and are not often negotiated . For example , exclusivity of artist 's services , limited power of attorney , personal authorization for discretionary use of artist 's name or likeness , and permission to enter into binding contracts are considered essential provisions necessary for good management . Other provisions are freely negotiable . The artist must make a realistic assessment of career goals , bargaining position , and alternatives to the terms offered by the manager in the contract . The most important points to negotiate are : The consideration or percentage due the manager The entire length or term of the contract Standards for management performance Advances vs. investments The way the contract is ended // Some important features in the management contract to explore with your lawyer are listed below . Management Percentage When negotiating this percentage the artist should consider current industry practices , the manager 's track record , the amount of time , effort and money being committed , and the portion of income that would be available to the artist after all fees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good manager who demands a higher percentage may be far better for an artist than an ineffective manager whose percentage is low . A sliding scale percentage may be the incentive to make the manager work harder . Length of the Contract This should be related to the manager 's performance . The initial period should provide enough time for a good manager to achieve predefined goals . Options or extensions should be strictly based upon specific standards of performance . Some contracts provide that the manager may not execute a certain option unless the artist 's gross income was above a set figure . In the music business , time and timing are among the artist 's most valuable assets . The years of peak earnings are limited and the artist should negotiate the length of the time committed in the contract so that success is not seriously hampered if this partnership does not work . Many managers insert automatic option clauses which they may execute without any reference to performance or changes in circumstances . Automatic options can lock an artist into a contract that has become unrealistic or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partnership , so explore the possibilities for solutions of anticipated problems . One very effective way is to state in the contract that both parties agree to binding arbitration before impartial arbitrators such as the American Arbitration Association . Termination of the Contract Sooner or later , all contracts come to an end . Be keenly aware of the total time a contract may run , including all possible options and extensions . Determine with your lawyer the maximum amount of time you are willing to commit to testing the effectiveness of the contract and the parties . How does this fit into your overall plans ? Consider provisions for performance standards and specific goals in terms of options , extensions , and termination of the contract . Disposition of Rights Your lawyer can help you detail the rights you transfer to the manager in the management contract . There may have been publishing rights , trade name or product ownership , or other similar assets of the artist which were granted to the manager . Specific provisions for the return of these rights or the payment of additional compensation for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CHAPTER VII Promotion Promotion of the artist 's talent or fame , and promotion of the artist 's creative product are two sides of the same coin . Both are necessary for a successful and financially rewarding career in today 's music industry . Other things being equal , the difference between talented " also-rans " and superstars may be effective promotion . There are promotion specialists who can handle all phases of promotion . Publicists , press agents , advertising or media personnel , record promoters , and concert promoters are some of the specialists who may be involved in promoting an artist 's career or product . Most new artists find that they have to promote themselves in order to get those first important breaks which open doors . Whether you promote yourself or hire specialists to do it , you must increase your understanding of the basic function of promotion , the results which can be achieved , and some basic tools which get results and are useful for promoting yourself or working with hired specialists . THE PORTFOLIO In Chapter IV , the portfolio was introduced as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including biography , resume , pictures , demos , record or tapes , 139 // reviews , etc. , is an invaluable promotion device . An impressive portfolio is a genuine asset and each artist should apply creative efforts to constantly upgrade and improve it to make this promotion tool an effective calling card . POSTERS , FLYERS , AND STICKERS Other aids for increasing the public 's awareness of the artist and product include posters , flyers , and stickers . These may be used to announce and advertise upcoming engagements and appearances as well as newly released records or feature articles about the artist . They help create interest in the artist 's career , increase attendance when the artist performs , and spur record sales . With posters and flyers , timing is very important . Plan ahead . It may take a week or so to print them and they must be seen by the public for at least two weeks to really make an impression . Where you display them is extremely critical . Locations where the material is highly visible to the maximum number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , train or subway stations , shopping centers , schools , record shops , music stores , and other places frequented by the market you 're trying to reach . Inexpensive posters , flyers , and stickers may be ordered from specialty printers . A clear picture which reproduces well , plus the desired copy or information may be attractively combined into an eye-catching poster or flyer . Black-and-white posters are cheaper , but additional colors can make the poster more attractive without adding too much to its cost . If you see a poster you particularly like , look along the borders for the printer 's name . Specialty printers are listed in the telephone directory and often advertise in local and national entertainment industry publications . Seek advice from knowledgeable // people about striking and pleasing color combinations , type faces , special designs , and sizes . Posters , flyers , and stickers are a form of direct advertisement requiring a unique touch that immediately captures the public 's attention and establishes what is being advertised . Flyers and stickers can be mailed as well as hand-distributed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Always put copies of all your posters or flyers in your portfolio . MAILING LISTS AND FAN CLUBS Develop a mailing list by getting the names , addresses , and phone numbers of friends and people in places you perform . The cost of maintaining and using extensive mailing lists is usually prohibitive for ordinary engagements . For special engagements or your own productions , mailing lists are invaluable . The cost of sending a one-page flyer out to 500 people usually varies from $75 to $150 , depending on printing cost , postage , and the amount of free help you can get to stuff and stamp envelopes . Stationery stores sell prepasted perforated address labels , complete with carbon inserts . One typing produces three or more readable copies which can be used for several mailings . A list could be typed in several columns on a single sheet which is xeroxed or reproduced then cut apart and the addresses pasted on individual envelopes . Money may be saved by sending your mailings third class to take advantage of lower postage rates . Third class mail is slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the mail to be delivered well ahead of the date of the event being advertised . A good method of building a mailing list is to have special folding cards printed with a photograph of the // artist on one side , and a form in which customers write in their name , address , and phone number on the other . These cards may be placed on tables or passed out at the door at engagements . Customers may be asked to drop these cards in a special box near the door , or the cards may be collected on their way out . Be sure to make the audience aware of the cards and their purpose . When a new record is released , a mailing list is useful to let fans know that your " new hit " is on the market , and where they can buy it . VIDEOTAPES AND FILMS These are effective tools to promote an artist or product . They may be expanded and modified for use in other types of promotion , such as concert and record promotion . Many booking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tours , want to see a live performance . A tape of the artist in action can often be substituted . Through a tape the artist can audition simultaneously in many places . Copies may be sent to different parts of the country or world at a fraction of the cost in money , time , and effort it would take to audition live . For example , one copy of the videotape may be sent to an important booking agent interested in hiring you in Australia while another copy is being shown in California to clinch an upcoming college concert tour . A first-class tape , made by a professional videotape or film outfit , may cost $1,500 or more . In light of their superior facilities and expertise , using professionals could prove to be a bargain . You may locate qualified semi-professionals at colleges and technical schools offering courses in filmmaking and videotaping . Many students are very imaginative and technically proficient . Some have worked as profession- // als and are in school to upgrade their skills . Using semiprofessionals could save you money . Ask to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them , and enlist their help in planning your presentation . Videotape and film playback equipment is readily accessible at most colleges , universities , and radio and TV stations . Most of the large booking agencies also have access to playback equipment . When planning a tape or film presentation , make it as interesting and exciting as your best show . The purpose of this presentation is to introduce the artist and show off performing ability . It may also be used to help promote a record by including and highlighting the selection in the presentation . The format should be well organized , making use of the principles of tension and release developed in Chapter V. This will permit planning the peaks of excitement that hold the viewer 's interest and attention to sell the artist and the product . Generally , taping an actual live performance before an audience that really digs your show is better than taping a studio performance . A live taping can capture the enthusiasm of the audience and demonstrate your ability to communicate and excite . The viewer can judge how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performance must be taped in the studio , work closely with the people there to preplan interesting shots , angles , or effects . Since tape copies cost from $30 up , be selective in sending them out . Mention the fact that a film or tape is available upon request when making up your promotional portfolio . If real , positive interest is shown and the tape is requested , it may be the clincher to seal the deal you 're after . Carefully and clearly label every tape and container with your name and address and provide return mailers . Keep track of when and to whom you give or mail a videotape copy so that you can get it back . // PROMOTING YOUR OWN ENGAGEMENTS How much can you make ( gross ) ? How much will it cost you to make this amount ( expenses ) ? And , how much is left for you ( net/profit ) ? The answers to these questions help determine whether you want to promote an engagement . Make realistic estimates . In calculating how much you can make , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how many people you actually expect to come . For example , if you give a special concert in an auditorium with 500 seats , and your tickets are priced at $5 per person , the most you can make is $2,500 ( 500 x $5 ) . If the house is 90 percent sold , your gross income will be $2,250 ( 500 x 90 percent x $5 ) . Prepare a careful budget of the expenses to be incurred . This includes the cost of renting the location , your promotion costs ( flyers , posters , mailings , newspaper , radio , or television ads ) , tickets , talent costs , equipment rentals , etc. ? and your own performance costs ( see Chapter IV ) . Continuing with the example above , if the total expense budget is $1,500 , then the amount you can make ( nett profit ) is $750 ( $2,250 minus $1,500 ) . Net equals gross income minus expenses . Based on the estimated net/profit you can determine whether promoting an engagement will be financially worthwhile . Your net return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if the tickets had been priced at $3 each and expenses remained the same , the gross income would have been $1,350 . With $1,500 in expenses , the net would be a minus $150 . In other words , you 'd take a $150 loss promoting this engagement at the $3 ticket price with no cut in expenses . When setting a ticket price be aware of going rates , competing events , and how much people actually will pay // to come to your production . Remember , do n't price yourself out of the market . Promoting your own engagements is risky business . Your plans must be carefully laid out and executed . If you decide to go ahead and try promoting an event , be sure to allow enough time to promote it properly . You 'll need at least eight weeks to get everything done once you 've decided on a date and location . Make a timetable and schedule everything to be done . For effective promotion , your schedule should reflect the following : Posters , flyers , and tickets should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the event . Radio , television , or newspaper advertisements are most effective during the last two weeks before the event . Mailing should be completed at least three weeks in advance . Minimum mailing time for follow-up reminders and ticket orders is one week . There should be adequate time to secure necessary licenses or permits . A well-planned schedule may look like this : First Week : Establish procedures for ticket sales and control . Determine the type and number of tickets needed . Set up an identification and ticket control numbering system . Begin work on layout , design and content of all material to be printed . Determine locations where tickets will be sold or printed matter distributed and displayed . Second Week : Check printing prices , schedules , and deadlines . How much time does the printer need to complete everything ? // Give yourself a few extra days to allow for the unexpected . Make final decisions on printed matter and place the order . Check newspaper and radio schedules and advertising costs and deadlines . Inquire about any available free publicity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radio plug . Thirst Week : Check with the printer for last-minute corrections or details . Put your mailing list in order and make final arrangments for addressing and stuffing envelopes . Develop ad copy and confirm commitments for air time or newspaper space . Fourth Week : Pick up printed matter and begin distribution of flyers and tickets . Mount posters and flyers for display . Get stamps , stuff envelopes , and complete all mail addressing . Enlist any additional help needed to place posters and flyers and for ticket distribution and sales . Keep track of all tickets , emphasizing that money must be collected as early as possible or tickets returned so that they can be sold . Fifth Week : Get the mailing out . Check on ticket sales and collect for tickets sold . Take copy to newspapers and radio stations . Review sales and returns . Plan for possible modifications . Sixth Week : Check display locations , replacing torn or damaged posters . Finalize operation plans for security , ticket sales or collections at the door , and personnel supervision . Make sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ availability of all performers contracted for the show . Make alternative plans for special situations that have arisen . // Seventh Week : Newspaper and radio ads begin . Get final mailing out ? follow-up reminders , tickets to be mailed , or announcements to new people . Review sales and collections . Make final inspection of location and confirm instrument or other rentals . Eighth Week : Step up flyer distribution for last-minute concentration . Make final ticket collections and close out advance sales . Last-minute promotion may include loudspeaker announcements and a concentrated flyer and phone-call campaign . Do the gig ! HOW A RECORD COMPANY HANDLES PROMOTION Records are a vital part of the music industry today . Every artist should have a basic understanding of how records are promoted by record companies . A record company aims its product at specific markets . The company chooses and releases records which seem likely to sell in its market . The company 's promotion staff is geared to promote its product in the company 's specialized markets . When evaluating a potential release the company 's A &R; department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people who will actually promote the record . They know that the promotion staff is in constant touch with the market and have a good feel for what will sell .
