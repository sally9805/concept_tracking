Just as President Nixon hoped , the Burger court is swinging to the " center . " The biggest losers are those who often seemed to be the Warren era 's biggest winners : criminal defendants . <P> Last week the Burger court sharpened that trend with a 5-to-4 decision limiting Miranda v. Arizona , the famous 1966 ruling that requires police to warn all suspects in custody of their rights to silence and counsel . Speaking for the majority , Chief Justice Burger offered prosecutors a possible way out when police fail to give the Miranda warnings . Until last week , such a failure was thought to make a suspect 's in-custody statements wholly inadmissible at his trial . <P> Now if an unwarned suspect later takes the stand , his pretrial statements to the police can be used to impeach his courtroom testimony . In sharp dissent , Justice William J. Brennan argued that the effect of the decision is that police may now " freely interrogate an accused incommunicado " despite Miranda ; the accused may then see his own careless words convict him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own defense . " Brennan 's argument failed to move Burger , who dismissed " the speculative possibility that impermissible police conduct will be encouraged . " <P> In another significant retreat from the Warren era , the Burger court last week also limited the widespread use of federal courts to halt state criminal prosecutions that are allegedly unconstitutional . Justice Hugo Black spoke for the majority in barring federal interference in state criminal trials except in cases of a prosecutor 's bad faith or harassment , or when a state law is " flagrantly and patently violative of express constitutional prohibitions in every clause , sentence and paragraph . " The ruling overturned a federal court victory for black militants in California . It was accompanied by related decisions that cleared the way for state obscenity prosecutions in three other states and the prosecution of black protesters in New York and Illinois . <P> Naked Decision . On another front , the court moved warily as it dealt with a complaint of many of today 's young law graduates : they oppose state rules that require them to submit to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be licensed to practice . In cases from Arizona and Ohio , the court ruled 5 to 4 that bar applicants need not list all of the organizations they have joined , or swear that they have never belonged to groups that advocate violent overthrow of the Government . But in a New York case , the court ( also 5 to 4 ) made a subtle distinction : New York , and presumably other states , may require bar applicants to reveal whether they ever belonged to a subversive group with the actual intent to advance its aims of overthrowing the Government . <P> Also at issue was the old puzzle of what constitutes free " speech " that is protected by the First Amendment . To protest Playboy magazine 's alleged sexual exploitation of women , eight students at Iowa 's Grinnell College stripped naked at a public meeting . Convicted of public indecency , they argued that their action was a form of speech and thus deserved immunity from prosecution . The Iowa Supreme Court ruled against them . By refusing to hear their appeal , the Burger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
