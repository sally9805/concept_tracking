The yacht Great Britain II was a week 's sail from Capetown when her fresh-water tanks sprang a leak and ran dry . Forced to live on a trickle of water distilled in a pressure cooker , the crew reached Capetown so weak that it took twelve men to lower and stow the big , billowy spinnaker . Between Capetown and Sydney the skipper of a French yawl and a British crewman on an Italian vessel were lost overboard in storms , and a Mexican boat suffered a knockdown . A British sailor drowned east of Sydney when he lost his footing and fell into the frigid ocean . <P> Those are but a sample of the disasters that have struck a fleet of 17 boats competing in the year 's most grueling sporting event-the first round-the-world sailing race . Since they tacked out from Portsmouth , England , last September , the competitors have rounded the Cape of Good Hope , crossed the storm-tossed Indian Ocean to Australia , and completed the dreary , dangerous , downhill passage round Cape Horn to reach Rio de Janeiro . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leg to Portsmouth , where the winner* will collect no cash-just a modest silver trophy , some medals and the satisfaction of winning the 27,000-mile endurance test sponsored by Whitbread &; Company , Ltd. , a British brewery . <P> When the race began , it shaped up as a battle between two big , custom-built racing machines , the 74-ft. ketch Pen Duick VI from France and the 72-ft. ketch Great Britain II . Both are captained by veteran sailors . Pen Duick Skipper Eric Tabarly won a singlehanded transatlantic race in 1964 ; Great Britain II 's captain , Chay Blyth , made a solo circumnavigation three years ago . <P> But the sea does not play favorites . Tabarly , a navy commander , was barely halfway to Capetown when his titanium mainmast collapsed . By radio , Tabarly ordered a new spar . Under jury rig , he headed for Rio , 1,200 miles away , to pick it up . The 82-ft. mast , fabricated in Switzerland , had to be cut in two to fit into a French military jet . Meanwhile Blyth , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleek boat does not necessarily go fast when manned by a crew of paratroopers with little sailing experience . <P> The glamour entries were not the only ones in trouble . Beyond the Cape of Good Hope , the " roaring forties " justified their ill repute . Italy 's Tauranga lost a crewman to the angry sea , and Dominique Guillet , captain of the French yawl 33 Export , was tossed overboard and lost when his safety harness snapped during a squall . Then came the terrifying moment when heavy seas rolled the Mexican ketch Sayula II so far her masts were deep under water . " There was no warning , " recalls Crewman Keith Lorence . " Suddenly there was a big crash and the lights went out . She righted herself in seconds , but she must have rolled at least 160 degrees . " Half of the twelve-member crew was injured .
