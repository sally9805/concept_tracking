txt The political struggle that is going on in China appears to have entered a new and possibly decisive phase with the sounding of a clarion call to the entire nation to close ranks behind Chairman Mao Tse-tung in a battle to the finish with the forces of reaction The summons appeared in an editorial in the People 's Daily Feb 2 Its tone raises fresh doubts as to whether the struggle can remain an orderly process under the tight control of the party ? or will erupt into turmoil and shake the country to its roots , as a similar campaign did during the 1966-69 Cultural Revolu-tion Gaon net tossed The party paper , in effect , threw down the gauntlet By declaring unequivocally that the campaign is the personal brainchild of Chairman Mao , that its outcome is crucial to the future of socialism , and that leaders at all levels of the party will be judged by their willingness to enlist , it eliminated the middle ground and posted a challenge that will be hard for the most determined fence-sitter to ignore Furthermore , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the masses of the people " rise in action , " the editorial also appeared to move the struggle into a realm in which it may be increasingly difficult for the party to chart the course and choose the targets Such a tactic implies that Chairman Mao may be seeking to outflank resistance by drawing directly on his massive support among the people , as he did during the Cultural Revolution While clearly of the first importance , the editorial did not greatly enhance an outsider 's understanding of the purposes of the campaign // *Mao enlists China 's masses in 1974 ' cultural revolution ' // In form , it was yet another essay on the necessity of criticizing the ancient sage Confucius and his alleged disciple , Lin Piao ? but there was still nothing to suggest who or what constitutes the real target of the allegory on the contemporary political scene A logical deduction would be that the campaign is aimed at elements who are seized with the same reactionary Ideas that are supposed to have inspired the late Mr Lin 's reported plot to seize power through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to such interpretations , already the campaign has claimed some minor victims , and their cases suggest the type of people who will be vulnerable to attack as the battle wears on In every instance that has been publicized , the offenders have been people in positions of responsibility who have undermined the reforms instituted during the Cultural Revolution , the stated purpose of which was to break the hold of " elitists " ? or , as the current jargon would have it , Confucianists Perils of backsliding In the weekend editorial , the dangers of backsliding were illustrated by reference to the two villains of the campaign , Confucius and Lin , who " each in his time wanted to restore the former system and attempted to turn the wheel of history backward . " In recent weeks , the press has featureed current examples of " turning the wheel backward " ? ? In education ? by reasserting the old authority of the teacher and subverting the system that reserves university places for the progeny of the proletariat ? in culture ? by writing books and plays that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " bourgeois " Western classical music ? In economic production ? by reverting to material incentives and a grabbag of other sinful practices known collectively as " economism " Teapot reward rapped The management of a chemical fertilizer plant in Lanchow was criticized for proposing that every worker be given a free teapot as a reward fprfilling the production ( the workers refused ) And the men responsible for running a wharf in Shanghai were hauled over the coals for urging the workers to accept cash bonuses ( the workers not only refused , but demanded the privilege of working overtime for nothing ) It is difficult to conceive of local management 's proposing such improbity unless they sensed that there was a willingness to tolerate it among the officials above them who man the ramparts of the economy ; likewise , in education and culture And it is hard to see how the campaign against backsliding can be limited to the platoon leaders and not eventually find targets higher up , among the officials who established the climate that allowed such malpractices to fester      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
