txt Letters to the Editor pg . 28 Letters to the Editor Leadership in a Nuclear World To the Editor : The Times ( July 28 ) quotes Governor Carter as saying that there is now rib possibility of a nuclear first strike without " unbelievable destruction on the originator of the attack . " Insofar as it argues against the first use of nuclear weapons , this view is enlightened and commendable . It is also widespread . But may I suggest an important refinement ? Namely , the counterattack would not befall the specific individual leader who ( alone ) can originate a nuclear attack . Rather its victims would be his country and his fellow countrymen , who can not . Before pressing his nuclear button , any national leader would surely be deep in his secret command post , probably far from his usual home or his national capital . He can be protected there in ways the rest of us can not , for example with hundreds of feet of rock or concrete overhead , and with vast supplies of air , water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if he likes . Before pressing the button he can even see to it that his favored relatives , friends , and associates ( male and female ) are there with him  --  those whom he wants ; while those whom he prefers to have out of the way are in target areas like the rest of us . The leader of a nuclear power who first takes the world into nuclear war is in fact the one person in all the world who can guarantee his personal survival  --  provided indeed that he does make the first move and is not caught outside his command post because he left the initiative to " the enemy . " Mr. Carter is refreshingly aware that top officials may make poor decisions on busing , health care or the economy because they send their children to private schools , have free access to Arms to Saudi Arabia To the Editor : Selling major arms to Saudi Arabia without adequate safeguards for American interests would seem to be an act of incredible folly . After all , this is the very same nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economies of the West through participating in an oil embargo and did in fact inflict severe damage on us and our allies . May I suggest that no weapons be sold to this nation unless at least two conditions are met and are included in a formal treaty which is approved by the Senate , as the Constitution provides . These conditions are : 1 . Saudi Arabia guarantees not to participate in any embargo of oil or other products against the United States for twenty years . 2 . Saudi Arabia pledges by treaty not to transfer any weapons sold to it under this treaty to another nation . Unilateral breach of this formal treaty would , of course , subject Saudi Arabia to the most severe repercussions from the United States . We certainly are entitled to elementary defense of our national interests if we are to help the Saudis defend theirs . ARNOLD W. RODIN Chicago , Aug. 2 , 1976 ?

Peterson ** Aug. 2 ) is quite right in challenging the view that the poor people in developing countries will not at all accept family planning until and unless their socioeconomic condition is improved , but his sample of observation in all the four countries he visited  --  India , Bangladesh , Philippines , Indonesia ? must have been very biased . Strangely enough , in his discussion with local leaders and the people themselves " never did anyone respond by saying that he or she needed more children to provide security in their old age , or labor for the farm , or proof of their virility . " In a recent research project carried out under my direction in the villages of Indonesia and Nepal , it has been found that the children are of great economic value to their parents both as contributors of labor and as oldage security .

Is it not also possible that those in topmost power in Moscow , Peking , or Washington may be corrupted by the prospect that a nuclear war would destroy their enemies , foreign and domestic , real and imagined , but it would not injure them personally ? Of course we can still hope that leaders will ' be restrained by what surely would befall their countrymen  --  and hundreds of millions of others . Certainly Governor Carter would be . But as we recall Hitler , and Stalin , and even Nixon cornered at last by Watergate , is the compassion of all nuclear armed rulers a theory on which to stake our survival and the future of our children ? LEWIS CHRISTIAN BOHN Croton-on-Hudson , N.Y. , Aug. 3 , 1976 mendation .

BIJOU SCHWARTZ Bronx , Aug. 4 , 1976 ? Applause for A Veto To the Editor : We must applaud Governor Carey for his courage in protecting the consumer by vetoing a bill , recently passed by the New York State Legislature , which would have lowered the fines against corporate violators found guilty of and convicted for short weighting . The law has been firmly established by a unanimous Court of Appeals decision that a corporation is subject to a maximum fine of $5,000 if convicted for violating the Agriculture and Markets Law for short weighting . The vetoed bill would have lowered such fine to a maximum of $200 for a first violation and not more than $400 for a second and subsequent violation . It seems ironic that in this age of consumerism such a bill should have been introduced in the first place , and , even more ironic , to have been passed in the Assembly by a vote of 146 to 0 and in the Senate by a vote of 31 to 20 . Is it really in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight and short measure products ? MELVIN TESHER Chairman , Legislative Committee Southeastern Weights &; Measures Assn. of New York State New City , N.Y. , Aug. 2 , 1976 by their perceptions of children 's economic utility and survival . Parents , however , are not generally interested or socially encouraged to have children at too close intervals . So modern family planning methods , if offered conveniently and with proper respect to their culture and human dignity , will be accepted by them to a certain extent . However , the experience of family planning programs in developing countries indicates that the quality and effectiveness of a program depends heavily on the country 's socioeconomic development . The countries with spectacular decline in fertility during 1960-1973 ( e.g. Hong Kong , Singapore , Taiwan , South Korea , Barbados , Jamaica ) not only had very strong family planning programs , but also ranked very high among , develOping countries in socioeconomic indices . Therefore , Peterson 's view that " poor people will practice family planning given the means to do so " is correct only in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ College of Physicians and Surgeons New York , Aug. 5 , 1976 Trusting the Germans To the Editor : I am one of the " young , livineon inherited emotions " who mistrust Germans as a whole , to whom Peter Gay refers in his Op-Ed articles of Aug. 3 and 4 . By the same token , I can not understand why Professor Gay does not imagine that the German young , my 20- to 30-year-old peers , do not live on inherited Nazi sentiments . . Children learn attitudes ( and prejudices ) from their parents . I know I did , and I see no reason to conclude otherwise about the new generation of Germans . The growing political importance of the New Germany is an irrelevant , expedient objection to . the wariness I have learned from all:toorecent history . Mr. Gay was fortunate enough to ? be expelled from Germany before , the horrors of concentration camp life could be thrust upon him . Perhaps his early exit makes it easier for him to contain his mistrust . I think it is unwise to let my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York , Aug. 4:1976 ? To the Editor : Judged in the abstract , Prof. Peter Gay 's two Op-Ed articles on - the Germans may make a lot of sense . ( incidentally , let us remember that Hitler , Heydrich , Seyss-Inquart , Kaltenbrunner , Eichmann , Skorzeny and many others were Austrians ) . Unfortunately , however , we do not think in the abstract ; our thinking is conditioned . by our experiences and by our emotions . In the 70 years from 1870 to 1940 France was invaded by the Germans to various depths no less than three times . Or , to put it differently , three consecutive generations of Frenchmen saw their country violated and raiAgtd by their eastern neighbors , while there has been time for only one generation to grow up free of such traumatic experience . What is needed is more time , more perspective and , above all , more testing . Evildoers are put on probation after serving their sentence . The Germans are still on probation , - and will continue to be , as long as . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not too muoh to ask , andthe asking for it surely does not " dramatize the German as a movie villain .

TREVES New York , Aug. 4 , 1976 ? Ayn Rand Explains To the Editor : In a letter in your issue of Aug. -1 , a Mr. Patrick Gunkel used my name and my works to imply that I support his ideas , which are the exact opposite of mine . For the record , I want to state the ** , Neither I nor " Atlas Shrugged nor my philosophy has any connection ; with the so-called " Libertarian " movement . I hold that politics without a consistent philosophical base leads to disaster . The " Libertarian " movement is a:random collection of emotional hippies-ofthe-right who seek to play at politics without philosophy or consistency. , I am a supporter of President Ford ? because , among today 's candidates , he is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has deironstrated its success in dealing with our economic crisis . I am profoundly opposed to Ronald Reagan . Since he denies the right to abortion , he can not be a defender Of any rights . Since he has no program and no ideology to offer , his likeliest motive for entering a Presidential'race is power-lust . His choice of an ultraliberal running mate serves to prove my point . To imply , as Mr. Gunkel does , that I would endorse so unprincipled an act of crude pragmatism , ls to perpetrate a gross misrepresentation . A question for all Republicans : Has n't Watergate demonstrated . the consequences of one anti-ideological pragmatist in the White House ? Do n't vote for another one . AYN RANn New York , Aug. 5 , 1976 ? Election Challenge To the Editor : The ultimate insult to rank and fife Republican voters was delivered ' on Aug. 3 , in a proceeding before The State Board of Elections in Albany. : . The 27,000 signatures on my nominating petitions for the Republican Senatorial primary were being Challenged by the Buckley forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack was the chairman of-the Conservative Party in Westchester County , Wilson Price . This is a perfect example of the ridiculous alliance which has developed between the Conservative and Republican Parties - in New York State , and the callous disregard that the leadership of both parties have for their rank and ? File membership . Senator Buckley and ' the Republican leadership in the State should be ashamed to have permitted and in fact encouraged this situation to take place . Family Planning in Developing Countries It is my hope that Republicans throughout the state will voice their outrage at this sellout by the Repilblican leadership to the Conservative Party . Apparently It is not enough : 1%r the Conservative Party to have ' dictated who the Republican nominee at the convention would be ; now they have the gall to try to disenfranchise the 27,000 Republicans who petitioned to place my name on the ballot , and give Republicans a - choice in September .
