txt " I COULD SEE IT COMING . . . The motorman must have been able to see that train ahead . Another lady saw it and screamed , ' 011 , my God ! " That was how Mrs. Rochelle Veitch , 17 , of 1811 Larch Av. , Mt . Prospect , described the moment before the four-car CTA train in which she was riding crashed into the rear of another standing in the Addison Street station on the Kennedy Line . Mrs. Veitch , who was riding in the first car of the train , was one of scores taken to half a dozen hospitals after the crash . She told a reporter : " I thought when I saw that train , ' This is it . This is the way it is . ' The next thing I knew I was on the floor and people falling on me . I was surprised I was alive . " Mrs. Veitch , who was being treated at Resurrection Hospital for back and foot injuries , brushed shreds of foam rubber List of CTA crash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . insulation out of her hair as she told of the experience . The shreds came from the walls of the battered car , she said . FIRST ON THE SCENE was the fire department 's snorkel squad No. 1 , headquartered at 1044 Orleans St. The squad 's Lt. Robert Sutherland said they found six passengers in one car on the first train lying under a " big clump of twisted steel frames . " " The metal floor had buckled , " Sutherland said . " and their legs and arms were under the floor . Sutherland said the passengers " had to be in a lot of pain , but they were just great . Their legs were cut severely . We had to pry up the floor to free their feet . " We talked to the people , and we told them we would get them out as soon as possible , and they might have a little pain . But the passengers , all women , never complained . Only one woman passed out , but only after we had freed her . I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or THE TRAPPED women , Sutherland said , kept asking about the train 's conductor . " She wanted to know if he had died . She seemed more worried about him than herself . " The eight-man snorkel squad used a hydraulic tool to pry up the car 's metal floor . Sutherland said the squad has had a lot of experience in such tasks in extricating auto passengers from wrecks on the Kennedy Expressway . Albert Castagna , 24 , of 8846 Berwyn Av. , who was in the last car of the train that was struck in the rear , said his car " was lifted about a foot off the rails by the impact . " The people in the back of the car were really hurt . A woman was wedged in and glass was broken all over . " He said he could see the injured in the car that rammed them . " Those people , " he said . " were cut , and they were bleeding . They had some kind of blue stuff all over their faces . " CASTAGNA , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there appeared to be something mechanically wrong . When the train stopped at Addison he said . " I heard a low dragging sound . It did n't sound right . There was a maintenance man getting in and out of the front of the last car . The next thing I knew boom ! We 'd been hit . " Castagna was treated at Northwest Hospital . Another victim raised the possibility that the second train may have been having mechanical difficulties . George Radcliffe , 60 , of 6232 Belle Plaine Av. who was riding in the second train , said that at a previous stop the train went past the usual stopping point . He added : " People getting on the train had to go forward on the platform to get on . And as it pulled into Addison Street station there was no slowing down and no braking . " When the trains crashed , he said , " we pushed the train ahead at least one car length . " Radcliffe , who was treated for a cut lip and cut leg at Northwest Hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few years ago at Logan Square . " Since then , " he said , " I always sit in the middle car facing backwards . HELGA DOBBERT , of 6256 N. Cicero Av. , who works as a secretary , said she was in the first train . " As we approached Addison , the train jerked and a fuse blew . The motorman kept coming in and out trying to fix it . The cars jerked again , The train was standing quite a while . All of a sudden people were lying in the aisle and ervine. inougnt It was an explosion . " Dobbert was treated at Resurrection Hospital for an injured left shoulder . Gary Bredfeldt , 21 , of 501 Parkwood Av. , Park Ridge , who was in the first train , said the impact threw him out the open door . " People were scrunched on top of one another in the back of the car . " Bredfeldt said he saw the second train about a half mile down the tracks .

Foley Jr. , 55 , of the department 's Research and Development division , said he was about to walk into the station at the time of the crash . " I saw it the first train start to move , and the second train plowed into it . The second train hit with enough force to raise both cars and then they buckled toward the platform . I knew some people had to be hurt . " Foley said he used a pay phone in the station to call police and fire departments and then stood by the head of the stairs to keep people from going down to the trains and claiming , for insurance purposes , that they were injured passengers . Foley said he saw Detective Clyde J. Craig , of Shakespeare homicide unit coming up the stairs holding his left side . He said Craig told him " I 'm hurt , but there 're a lot worse than I am down there . "         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
