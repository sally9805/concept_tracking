AIRLINES High-Level Mess While the world monetary system continues to rattle and shake , another citadel of international agreement is falling further into disarray . The airline cartel , embodied in the 108-member International Air Transport Association , has entered a fresh round of warfare over transatlantic air fares . Passengers stand to benefit from lower fares , but some lines may suffer disastrous losses . <P> The latest eruption came after Pan Am and TWA sent officers to Washington two weeks ago to ask the Civil Aeronautics Board to intervene in the fare fight . In a complex and involved maneuver , the lines wanted the CAB to ask the State Department to put pressure on the West German government ; with that , the Bonn government was supposed to put pressure on Lufthansa to reconsider its new fares ( as low as $210 round trip in the off-season ) . <P> Figuring that the German government would balk if it knew that the U.S. airlines had directly inspired the diplomatic maneuver , the Pan Am and TWA officers asked that part of the 29-page transcript of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No such luck . The CAB men , miffed that the lines wanted to bring the State Department into the act , put the transcript on public sale - at $1.50 a page . <P> Summertime Blues . If Pan Am and TWA were to match Lufthansa 's new fares , the companies ' spokesmen said , they would stand to lose a combined total of about $60 million in revenues next year . To turn a profit on the North Atlantic ( last year Pan Am lost $7 million and TWA earned $14.1 million on that route ) , the lines would have to fly their planes 75% full on the average . " Given the seasonal characteristics of this market , " said TWA Senior Vice President Elaine Cook , " to average 75% year round , you would have to maintain something like a 120% load factor in the summertime . " <P> The estimates of loss may be open to question , because the low fares will attract more passengers . But even officials of Lufthansa , which is 74% owned by the West German government , admitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the North Atlantic this year ; some airline men say the line may continue to lose next year , despite the new fares . Lufthansa had introduced the fares because its executives feared that the alternative , a fare package worked out by IATA members last summer , would be difficult to administer . <P> Heads of most other foreign carriers do not believe that reducing fares as low as Lufthansa did can be profitable ; yet to avoid losing customers to Lufthansa , Air Canada and Air France have posted comparable prices . Last week Swissair asked its government to approve a fare of as little as $180 round trip for groups of ten who buy from $70 to $149 each worth of meals , lodging and sightseeing along with their tickets . Two weeks ago Irish Aer Lingus announced a $500 first-class , 14-to-28-day fare from New York to Shannon , and an unlimited-stay economy fare of $320 in the off season . <P> All of the new fares will take effect after Feb. 1 , 1972 , when the present IATA fare arrangement expires . Air-industry men hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fare schedule that all lines would recognize . Meanwhile , airlines continued to fill newspapers and magazines with ads stressing low fares , and more announcements of price cuts are expected in the next few weeks .
