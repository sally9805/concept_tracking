THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment FENV events in recent times have arrived more unexpectedly than the revolution now in progress in Iran . In the United States , several light industries for observation and prognostication , including the academic community , the news media , and the Central Intelligence Agency , were caught almost entirely by surprise . The Soviets appear to have been equally unprepared . There was one prescient comment , though , which came from an unlikely quarter . In a very interesting but seldom quoted passage of Alexander Solzhenitsyn 's famous Harvard commencement address , he observed , " Every ancient and deeply rooted self-contained culture , especially if it is spread over a wide part of the earth 's surface , constitutes a self-contained world , full of riddles and surprises to Western thinking . " Russia , he said , was one such world ; China , India , and " the Moslem world " were others . In the colonial and post-colonial periods , he noted , it was widely assumed that every society on earth would eventually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , " The persisting blindness of superiority continues to hold the belief that all the vast regions of our planet should develop and mature to the level of contemporary Western systems , the best in theory and the most attractive in practice ; that all these worlds are but temporarily prevented ( by wicked leaders or by severe crises or by their own barbarity and incomprehension ) from pursuing Western pluralistic democracy and adopting the Western way of life . Countries are judged on the merit of their progress in that direction . But in fact such a conception is a fruit of Western incomprehension of the essence of other worlds , a result of mistakenly measuring them all with a Western yardstick . " These words could have been studied with profit by American officials , who were scarcely ahle to believe that a " modernizer " like the Shah could lose popularity with his people . And they could have been instructive to the Shah himself , who appears to have made precisely the mistake of measuring the progress of his own country with an alien , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succeed in awakening the two superpowers to the possibility that rebellions in the Third World against modernization and in favor of traditional ways might he gathering new strength  --  in a word , that " Westernization " might he on the wane . It may have been Solzhenitsyn 's understanding of his own country as one of those with a destiny separate from the West 's which led him to this perception . In George Steiner 's description , he is " a Slavophile and Orthodox visionary , equally repelled by Soviet Communism and by Western technological materialism . " In truth , there is little in our modern period which is to his liking . He is an uncomfortable ally for the adherents of any standard contemporary political creed . American liberals admire his heroic opposition to Soviet re-pression but are disappointed by his rejection of parliamentary democracy . Conservatives are well pleased with his hatred of Communism but distressed by his strictures against unfettered capitalism , with its pollution of the environment and its " revolting invasion of commercial advertising . " Far from taking sides in the dispute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside both , regarding them as two rotten branches on the single rotten trunk of an atheistic materialism that took root in the soil of the Renaissance and the French Revolution . Solzhenitsyn 's philosophy bears a surprising resemblance to that of the Iranian revolutionary leader , Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini . Both men radically reject the works of the modern world . Both are religious fundamentalists and theocrats . Both have the courage and strength but also the rigidity and intolerance that often accompany intense religious conviction . ( In Khomeini 's case , the intolerance appears to run so deep that there is a distinct danger that , having overthrown the dictatorship of the Shah , he will set up another dictatorship in its place . ) Both sit in moral judgment not only on their own countries but on the entire world . Both turn to the distant past for inspiration : Solzhenitsyn looks to the Middle Ages for the spirituality that he feels is lacking in the present , and Khomeini seeks the precedent for his " Islamic Republic " in the reign of Imam Ali , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despise modern popular culture -- particularlv in its American form . Both have spent their lives opposing repressive regimes , but neither is a notable friend of democratic procedure . ( Khomeini 's grasp of democratic principles is especially weak , or perhaps nonexistent . He professes belief in freedom of speech and artistic expression but goes on to say that " certain things that would lead to the corruption and demoralization of man " or would be " harmful to human dignity " will be " prohibited . " Just who is to decide which things fall in the prohibited categories is left unclear , but Khomeini has told an interviewer that he can be regarded as the future " strong man " of Iran . ) Both men have spent a part of their lives in exile . Both have a physical appearance of the kind that is often associated with Biblical prophets . Both are ardent patriots . And both have brought bafflement to the ruling circles of the world 's great powers . For several decades , the attention , interest , and energy of capitalists and Communists have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worlds . Now these rival worlds are on notice that they arc both under the scrutiny of two stern pairs of eyes belonging to unbending , independent judges who like absolutely nothing of what they have seen so far . ? ? Tom , Dick , and ( No ) Harry SOMETHING in what the com-munications industry calls " the international news " made us wonder , a couple of months past , what the Smothers Brothers would have said about it , in their cheery and offhand but pertinent fashion . Then we remembered that the supper club that had housed them in this town  --  the first Blue Angel , over on East Fifty-fifth Street  --  hid regrettably breathed its last fifteen years ago , and that the Brothers had been taken off the air five years after that , hecause , as cheerily and offhandedly and pertinently as ever , they had upheld a point of view ( about what was happening in Vietnam ) that bothered their network ( CBS ) . Next day , still musing , we realized that the Smothers Brothers were among us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surreptitiously , assumed the leads in " I Love My Wife , " a musical comedy that had already been on Broadway for more than a year . Or not exactly a comedy the running joke , a swapping of wives which does not actually come about , had been embellished by a rather too heavy dosage of smirk . Out of loyalty to the Brothers , we returned to " I Love My Wife , " and there we discovered that they had converted all the smirk into true comedy . We decided to track down the friend we call Owl , whose resumes always state that " for the last fifty years of his undergraduate career " he has " majored in night life , " to inquire about what had happened to the Brothers in the decade since they dropped below our horizon . Cornered at lunch near our office , Owl said : Tom , Dick , and Harry Smothers . Ah , yes . Knew them well . ( At times , Owl thinks he is W. C. Fields . ) Of course , Harry was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was just my own name for him . He was part of the act for a while when it arrived at the Purple Onion , in San Francisco . Spring of ' 59 . Tom and Dick were fresh out of San Jose State and fresh out of the joint just off campus where they did their standup humor and singing , and they had picked up that Harry en route . But Tom and Dick were born here , at Fort Jay , on Governors Island . Their Army-officer parent had been posted there , and when they were still pretty small he was posted to the Philippines and took his family along . The boys were packed off with their mother to California just before Pearl Harbor . Their father was taken prisoner by the Japanese and died on a prison ship . At one time , they had a notion of going to West Point , but finally decided against it . Where have they been You do n't get to Vegas , the way I do  --  Vegas , the American megalopolis that replaced the Old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have seen them there after their fall from television . You would have seen them together in other clubs out West , and you would have seen them separately when they began doing regional theatre . Clubs are the best training in the world for actors , provided the trainees can conquer the change in technique the stage requires . I remember that Torn conquered it in a big hurry when he was at the Cherry County Playhouse out at Traverse City , in that wonderful resort part of Michigan 's Lower Peninsula . He was doing " Play It Again , Sam , " and when he walked onstage for the first time and the audience applauded him he went out of character and began taking bows . He 'd forgotten he was n't working a club . Dick and I still tease him about that . And I can recall seeing Dick do " The Prisoner of Second Avenue . " They kept on working , steadily , and then they became - landed gentry . Dick bought land in Santa Cruz , on the coast south of San Francisco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he set up a winery , and at a concourse of California winegrowers at the Los Angeles County Fair last year  --  with about a thousand entries --  his Gewurztraminer won Grand Prize ; Tom has acreage in the wine country north of San Francisco , in Sonoma County , and his vines , which he has already set out , should come onstrcam in 1985 and he ready to supply Dick 's winery . So we may not be seeing so much of the Brothers in the future . Well , they have had their fun . They 've done Broadway , and made out well indeed . The show got re-reviewed here and there after they moved in . Then came an invitation to go to the White House . And they 've introduced new bits of business and new bits of dialogue into the show , working with Gene Saks , who directed it , and on their own as well . Being allowed to do that is always heartening to a performer . And being landed gentry means you do n't have to work in any old play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will go on with the theatre , but Dick 's got a household and that win- " But I thought once the I.R.S. applied a penalty , that was the end of it . " ? ? ery . Still , it 's not far from the town where he and his brother and I had the time of our young lives as they played the Purple Onion  --  the town where he can work again whenever he might want to . In ' 59 , there was an undergraduate audience every night at the Onion , and also at the hungry i , the club run by Enrico Banducci , who was the untitled night mayor of San Francisco . Those clubs were the counterparts of the Blue Angel and the Ruban Bleu here . The Brothers were making fun of everything , and soon the same bill  --  was Phyllis Diller , a local girl not far along in her career . Over at the i , Mort Sahl was reading the daily papers out loud and offering his merrily mordant commentary thereon . When Edmund Wilson 's treatise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sahl was instantly into that topic , too , sure that his audience , from the big campuses in Berkeley and Palo Alto , would know what he was joking about , and he was right . It was Banducci , by the bye , who  --  when he set himself and his club up in an inexpensive cellar in San Francisco 's North Beach  --  decided not to cover up the walls of soft old red brick , and so began a fashion in bars and restaurants and clubs across the country . And then Torn and Dick came East to the Blue Angel , and then to their own operation on the television screen . They and their colleagues finally dished up what I think they called " A Fable for Our Times . " It seemed to be happening in King Arthur 's Court . The war was on in Vietnam , and L. B. J. , as the King , had just abdicated . His sword , Excalibur , had been thrust deep into a hunk of granite onstage . And only he who could withdraw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kennedy , Wallace , and Humphrey , Knights of the Round Table , failed . Then some nondescript character  --  the stand up comic Pat Paulsen , who was a mock candidate for the Presidency on a Stop the Vietnam War platform  --  walks onstage , goes over to the sword , and pulls it out easy as pie . The Brothers ' show was nominated for an Emmy three times , and in its last year the show 's writers really did get an Emmy . Next , of course , the Smothers Brothers got bumped off the air . Happens to other people , too . A girl I knew won a Tony one season and was never able to get herself cast for any other show on Broadway . About San Francisco back then . We all thought that Sahl , because of his quick turn of mind , had it good at the hungry i  --  what to say popped automatically out of him as he read the newspapers . But the Smothers Brothers had to work up their skits from virgin sources , and they felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would have got out of the standup comedians working Miami and Vegas ! Then Tom and Dick found that doing twenty-one shows a week , all new wordage , was too much for people who did n't use writers to do their " original " thinking . No matter : they kept on inventing as fast as they could . One night , Sahl wanted a night off from the hungry i , and the Smothers Brothers went over from the Onion and subbed for him . It was done in the communal spirit of the times  --  of San Francisco before disco , before Haight-Ashbury . I see Tom and Dick together at lunch , and they 're together onstage for practically the full length of " I Love My Wife , " and I see them together at supper after the theatre . People say to them , " How can you two stand being with each other all the time ? " They say , " Why not We 've got plenty to talk about . " One night during the holidays , a bunch of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frankie &; Johnnie 's for supper , and they did all the talking . What were they talking about ? Not themselves or their work . They were telling us about the grandfather they grew up with after they lost their father . Then Dick said , " I 've got to call home . We 'll soon have to be doing the crushing and bottling , and it has to he done exacdy right . " He and I got into a cab , because we live close to one another , and Tom said he had a date with a girl who 's in their show , and he started to walk toward Eighth Avenue . Six pretty girls , about the age we had been back in San Francisco , were coming from Eighth Avenue . They saw Tom , and they be gan shrieking " It 's Tommy Smothers ! " and sort of patting him on the back , as if they 'd just found their runaway house cat . Torn stood smiling at them . " Everything 's all right , " Dick said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onstage .

Mr. Bambridge has this gift . One recent afternoon , he stood on the edge of a playing field , in an area that will soon become a working stoneyard , populated by working stonecutters and stone carvers , north of the Cathedral Church of Saint John the Divine , at 113th Street and Amsterdam Avenue , and looked upward . Above him , rising a hundred and thirty-eight feet from the foundation , he could see the unfinished north tower of the cathedral . There is a matching truncated tower at the south corner . Construction of the cathedral began in 1892 and proceeded if unsteadily  --  until 1911 , when it was interrupted . It resumed in 1916 and halted completely in 1941 . Under Mr. Bambridge 's guidance , it is about to resume again , and continue for at least five years . Mr. Bambridge was trained as a stonemason but is now a master builder , with full responsibility for the new work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of huge blocks of Indiana limestone into workable slabs , preparing drawings and patterns for the cutting and carving of the stones that will go into the catheTHE NEW YORKER dral , numbering the stones , and , finally , guiding each stone into its designated spot in the tower . It now seems plausible that someday the towers will rise one hundred and fifty-two feet higher . As Mr. Bambridge stood beside the playing field , however , he was n't preoccupied with thoughts of a finished product . After staring up at the air space that the towers might fill , he lowered his gaze to ground level . Heavy rain had fallen the previous day , and his shoes were sinking an inch or so into the mud . " Right now , the only thing I 'm thinking of is getting this stoneyard under way , " he said , moving toward higher ground . After consulting with Michael Antonson , a young architect , who was carrying a sketch of the proposed layout of the stoneyard , Mr. Bambridge pointed to various spots on the perimeter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now is where the road goes , where the trucks will bring in the quarried stone , " he said . " Six inches of wire-reinforced concrete in the roadbed . The mobile crane will stand there , and the gang saw , for the initial cutting , over there . We 'll have the circular saws  --  those are the ones with the diamond-impregnated blades  --  here , and the planer , which makes the moldings and curves , next to it . The masonry sheds for the cutters go on the opposite side of the road , and over there is the workshop for the cold-weather months . When we 've cut and carved the stones and numbered them , we 'll stack them against the base of the building . The rough-hewn quarry blocks will go along the fences . That way , the people passing by on the sidewalk can see what we 're up to here . " Part of the plan for the construction project calls for the training of apprentice masons , most of whom will come from Morningside Heights , the cathedral 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old , served his own apprenticeship , for five years after the Second World War , with Trollope &; Colls , a London firm that had a contract to restore the Houses of Parliament to pre-war condition . From there , he gravitated toward cathedrals . Of late , he has been coming to New York periodically from England , where he has been supervising the restoration of the west end of Wells Cathedral , in Somerset . Before he began that job , he directed the final work on the recently completed Anglican cathedral in Liverpool . " The foundation cornerstone was laid there in 1904 , " he said . " I arrived in 1967 . The previous contractor went into liquidation  --  not because of the cathedral but from another job . He left on a Friday . I came in the following Monday and stayed for ten years . " Building a Gothic-style cathedral out of hand-worked masonry takes a while  --  a few decades here , a few decades there  --  and Mr. Bambridge looks and acts like a patient man . He has a neatly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robust manner . He wears a necktie on the job . During his most recent trip to New York , he stayed busy constantly , but nothing about him seemed rushed . When we went to visit him , he had fallen a bit behind his schedule for the day ( some optimistic representatives from a brass foundry had wanted to discuss a possible contract for the tower bells ; they were , we guessed , three or four years ahead of their schedule ) , so he gave us a brisk tour of the cathedral , where there is plenty of interior masonry work to be done , and then led us out onto the playing field . He and Michael Antonson looked at the final drawings for the stoneyard and agreed that they could , at last , picture what it would look like . For Mr. Bambridge , this signified an uncharacteristic leap of vision . The architectural renderings of a completed Cathedral Church of Saint John the Divine , for instance , have been extant for fifty years . The plans show , among other things , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the main body of the cathedral . Construction of the south transept has never begun . Vertical and diagonal steel girders protrude at the hundred-foot level from the unfinished north transept . Vhen we asked Mr. Bainbridge whether he thought he might someday work on that part of the church , he glanced toward the north transept and quickly looked away . " That 's not even under consideration  --  not in my mind , at least , " he said firmly . " I do n't even know that that exists . "
