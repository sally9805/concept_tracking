The indictment last May of Bert Lance , the former Budget Director , on charges that he conspired to violate federal banking law hardly caused a stir in citadels normally sensitive to scandal . Some members of the press , perhaps feeling that Lance had already been tried and convicted , reacted to the seventy-one-page indictment with the casual comment that most of the allegations were already public knowledge . At the White House , ten minutes after it was learned that Lance would be charged by the Atlanta grand jury , the President went jogging around the South Lawn . And few in the political opposition used the event as an occasion to take to the microphones and preach publicly on the virtues of a balanced checkbook . If Lance had any luck at all in the entire matter , it was that his brush with the law occurred in this jaded decade , during which many politicians , including a few running for President , have faced a judge and jury . Although the potential for scandal abounds ? given that Jimmy Carter appointed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend , who , it is now alleged , had a penchant for writing bad checks ? the Lance case , in its complexity , defies understanding . What Bert Lance did while chairman of the Calhoun Bank and then as president of the National Bank of Georgia would be ever so much easier to comprehend if Lance and his associates had donned stocking masks , brandished shotguns. and entered the banks in search of fat payrolls ? but that did not happen . As a result , the allegations against Lance build in the reports , interviews , and subpoenaed bank documentsthat have accumulated since 1976 in the offices of those charged with the investigation . This group includes , at one stage or another , the Securities and Exchange Commission , the Comptroller of the Currency , a special prosecutor within the Justice Department , and several committees in Congress , in addition to the grand jury . By spending three months with the public record , L. J. Davis has assembled a chronology of the charges against Lance . From documents difficult to obtain and from persons familiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into English the statistical diagnosis of Lance 's fiscal condition . The indictment , something of a summary of these probings , is the tip of a paper iceberg , the extent of which can be measured by the five bound volumes of the hearings conducted by the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs . The documents are testimony that banking is no longer the quaint endeavor of men shifting gold bars from one pile to another , but the work of silicon chips in high-speed computers , in which fictitious money can become the possession of the shrewdest programmer . Despite the formality of the indictment , in the slow progression toward justice it is but another interim report , although one more specific than that delivered by Jimmy Carter in 1977 , when it was thought in the White House that Lance might be able to hold onto his job . " Bert , " the President said , after dismissing the allegations against his Budget Director , " I 'm proud of you . " ?

Nixon had King Timahoe . Gerald Ford had Liberty . Jimmy Carter has Plains . True , a town is n't exactly something that can be photogenically frolicked with in the Rose Garden , nor can you pull its ears on television , but unlike a dog , it is an extremely good vehicle for demonstrating , through innocence by association , the humility and solidity of the Executive character . It is the old log cabin updated and improved . A small town is full of folks who have a way of marching through the suburban imagination like the supporting players in an old Andy Hardy movie , true blue , upstanding , and ever so slightly but endearingly nuts . The rest of us might just as well surrender our franchise and lay our cynicism down in restful sleep ; if their anointed favorite son had ever got badly out of line ? if he had , say , looted the local bank ? they would n't have let him get to first base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore extremely fortunate for Bert Lance that , when his hour of need struck at last , he was able to imitate his erstwhile best friend and wave Calhoun , Georgia , before the nation like a banner with a strange device . While he did n't exactly inform the Senators that it was an earthly paradise set in a garden without blemish , he might as well have ; he missed no opportunity to remind his auditors that he was but a simple country banker from a place that , well , might not he much by some standards , although for his part , he was proud to call it home . In a way , it was a fair trade . Mr. Lance may have appropriated what is , to date , Mr. Carter 's only successful symbol . but it seems to be a reasonable enough compensation for Mr. Lance 's invaluable lessons in how to borrow money for one purpose and use it for another . ( I confess that this is speculation ; maybe he did n't teach Mr. Carter how to do that at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Mr. Carter 's campaign manager , but a glance at the books of Mr. Carter 's Presidential campaign strongly indicates that he sure taught somebody . ) Bert Lance 's repeated implication that his hands were clean because he was a hick failed utterly to weigh against the evidence ; in September , 1977 , he suddenly found it advisable to stop talking about Calhoun and actually go there . He is in Calhoun yet , or at least they say he is ; judging rom the conspicuous lack of success my colleagues and I have had in laying eyes on him there , he might very well be playing a round of golf in Riyadh with his new Saudi Arabian friends . A visit to Calhoun has its compensations , but the pleasure of Bert Lance 's conversation is not among them , although I wasnearly polited to death by the nice lady who answers his telephone . Judging from her spry and chipper tones , one would think that her employer was accused of nothing more serious than a bad umpiring call in a sandlot softball game , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they ca n't seem to figure out what all the fuss is about . Lance 's gifts to Calhoun have been considerable , and his most recent ones are not among the least . Thanks to the activities of Lance and his associates , the money in the First National Bank is as safe as if it were being guarded by the Comptroller of the Currency himself in effect , it is being guarded by the Comptroller of the Currency himself ; thanks to a sustained blitz by federal examiners , Calhoun First National is at present one of the soundest , best managed , and most conservative financial institutions this side of the West German treasury . And while Calhoun will never be a convention center , the regional hotel industry has experienced quite a little boomlet in the care and feeding of newspaper reporters and other jackals of the press who drift through , trying to figure out what the hell Bert Lance actually did . If reports from the scene of the crime have been sparse , it is for an excellent reason ? the same excellent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small towns who left them voluntarily . Although the perfectly decent people who live in Calhoun have been told that they are the backbone of the Republic until they have come to believe it , the backbone of the Republic is actually located elsewhere ; events and personages in small towns take on a curious subaqueous quality of filtered light and muffled sound and distorted perspective , and even the most obvious and substantial things take on the insubstantiality of a dream . This can he very restful . It can also mean that a man can rob the hank and get away with it so long as he goes to church . Bert 's boomtown ALHOUN LITTLE RESEMBLES the sleepy southern town of song and story ; instead , it gives the impression that somebody knocked it cold years ago and it has never come to . Situated in a tumbled country of second-growth timber where the deep coastal plain begins to wrinkle on the knees of the Piedmont , it is the legal residence of 6,000 souls . Some 7,000 more live in the immediate vicinity , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible to drive in one end of Calhoun and out the other without achieving any sense that you 've actually neen to the place . First comes a straggle of supermarkets and auto-supply stores and burger stands with homiletic epigrams on their marquees ( " Trying times are the times for trying , " , " Do n't pull tomor- 48 row 's cloud over today 's sunshine , " that sort of thing ) , then U.S. 41 becomes Wall Street for a while , a few nondescript brick buildings slip past on the left , and Wall Street turns back into U.S. 41 . First impressions are notoriously deceptive , but , like paranoia , they are also sometimes informative ; Calhoun is largely invisible from the road because most of it is hidden up on a hill behind some trees , but even knowing that , one still finds it difficult to account for the near total absence of human and animal life . A cannonball , if fired down the principal canyon of trade on a recent morning , would have found its progress impeded only by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Calhoun is the site of New Echota. the last eastern capital of the Cherokee nation , where the legendary Sequoya perfected his alphabet . Shortly thereafter , the Cherokees left for Oklahoma , where they remain to this day . As one might expect , Calhoun 's undisputed nerve center is the First National Bank . It is a large structure , relatively new , and ? along with a couple of windowless Southern Bell substations ? one of the few buildings in town with any architectural pretension . It also has a sign that spells out messages . Thecriminology buff will find in it little of interest ; the locus of white-collar crime has a way of appearing entirely ordinary . In the case of the Calhoun First National Bank , this means that there is nobody there but the clerks . Calhoun appears deserted because everyone in town is at work ; by a curious paradox , Calhoun looks half-dead because it 's booming with Bert Lance 's boom , and every employable in town has hied himself down to the carpet mill . ( At least the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a small public-housing project down on the flood-plain of the Oostanaula River , staring through the screen doors as though under orders to stay inside until an all-clear was sounded . ) Although the imminent opening of a disposable-diaper factory and a cement-mixer plant are eagerly awaited events and Jack Carter 's soybean silos are something of a tourist attraction , tufted carpets are the big news in Calhoun . More than eighty mills are in operation , and they 're one of the main reasons the good citizens of Calhoun may someday add a statue of a portly fellow in a business suit to the little plaza in front of the library where the Indian stands . If the rest of the country rather fuzzily sees Bert Lance as a per- son who seems to have used some other people 's money without asking for it first , the Bert Lance known to Calhoun is the man who broke the lock on the vault at the bank and made prosperity come to town . And as far as they 're concerned , anybody who lays a hand on him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undisputed tufted-carpet capital of the known universe . The industry traces its origin to 1895 , when a young Dalton woman named Catherine Evans sewed the first " candlestick " or chenille stitch of modern times while making a wedding bedspread for her sister . Whether she did this by accident or design is a matter that has never been cleared up , but in a twinkling a number of alert local entrepreneurs combined her discovery with the area 's single greatest natural resource ? hundreds and hundreds of desperately poor white people with time on their hands ? and formed a shanty-based bedspread empire that took the country by storm . The social legislation of the New Deal pretty much put paid to that aspect of the undertaking , and those days are viewed with nostalgia now , the subject of lithographs in executive boardrooms depicting clean men in Model T 's delivering yarn and patterns to dirty but overjoyed rural families clearly in the grip of some wasting disease . Piecework gave way to automation , bedspreads gave way to rugs , and the city of Dalton 's 125 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boomtown in the energy belt . By a happy chance . running a carpet mill is n't at all difficult compared with running , say , a shipyard or a television station . The typical mill is housed in a huge prefabricated sheet-metal shed that can be belted together rapidly with simple tools . The machinery , though deft , is uncomplicated , and the work itself is sufficiently light that much of it can be performed by nonunionized , modestly paid , unskilled women . The market for the finished product is perking along at a healthy clip , and a trained sales force can easily be obtained by means of raids upon one 's competitors . All you need is money . Money , as it happened , was in conspicuously short supply in Calhoun , although it was being coined a scant twenty miles away in Dalton . The reason for this sorry state of affairs is neither very complicated nor very obscure . For most of the first half of this century , small Georgia towns like Calhoun were traditionally dominated by two local institutions : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these enterprises were run by the town 's two most powerful families or congeries of families . In Calhoun they came visibly together in the person of one man , old Mr. A. B. David , who was both president of the bank and a highly interested spectator in the fortunes of the Echota Cotton Mills . A pillar of the church and the community , he was also notoriously tight with a dollar in matters not pertaining to his immediate family . ' Before Bert came into that bank , " says Clarence Harris , a successful carpet manufacturer , " it was difficult if not impossible to get any money out of it . Back in the Fifties they would n't even give me $300 to establish a credit rating . " It is relatively easy to control a town when only a chosen few are rich . It is extremely hard to control a town when lots of people are making lots of money . They tend to have their own ideas about how things ought to run . ERT LANCE did n't marry the bank-B er 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ granddaughter . One of the problems with writing down much of the Bert Lance story is that it 's corny ; he really lived the American Dream , and in the end it destroyed him . Born in 1931 , the son of an educator who served as president of Young Harris College and later as superintendent of the Calhoun school system , Lance was by all accounts the sort of plucky , cheerful , industrious youth who otherwise dwells exclusively in the early pages of a tycoon 's ghost-written memoirs . He supplemented the family income with a multitude of odd jobs while keeping well up with his schoolwork and participating in a full schedule of boyish activities of which he was inevitably the spark plug ? indeed , though he never seemed to sleep . his disposition never soured . Mind you , I do n't believe for an instant that Bert Lance , Perfect Youth , ever existed , but this is the image his neighbors choose to project and , in large measure , believe . They 're trying to make a case , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charges they neither understand nor believe . Lance as a person has an odd way of disappearing entirely from their talk , becoming a sort of self-propelled abstraction of everything the North does to the South , everything cities do to small towns , everything intellectuals and foreigners do to Americans with high-school educations . Listening to his elders and contemporaries , one catches a persistent unwitting echo of Conrad 's Marlow : he was one of us and that 's why you hate him , he was one of us , only he was better . All his life , Bert Lance has been a stand-in for fantasy . It is an edged gift . A clever man will use it . A cunning man will exploit it . But it is vital that fantasy 's surrogate never , never begin to believe it himself . or it will turn in his hand . Every age shapes its preferred scenario for its golden lads , and we are dealing with the 1950s . Lance proceeded on to college , first Emory and later the University of Georgia , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell directly into the place old Mr. David had prepared for him at the bank , neatly and inevitably . In a way , it was a fortunate meeting of congnment needs : Lance needed a job , which he all too easily got , and Mr. David , whose own offspring had an aptitude for spending money , found a successor . I In 1963 , at the age of thirty-two , Bert Lance became the youngest bank president in the state of Georgia . The prime entrepreneur HE CALHOUN FIRST NATIONAL Under Lance 's stewardship has been characterized as the quintessential good-ole-boy bank , where the loan officer would hand you a stack of bills on the strength of your sig- nature if he knew your daddy ? an impression abetted by Lance 's later assertion that his loan policies were influenced by the way the prospective borrower maintained his lawn . In fact , it was nothing of the sort ; Bert Lance more than lived up to his advance billing , and everything he touched turned to gold . As he consolidated his control over the bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it as a source of venture capital . While this in no way resembles the way Chase Manhattan does business ( as the acting Comptroller of the Currency later remarked with some heat ) , it bears a convincing resemblance to the policies advocated by a ' man Lance may never have heard of : John Maynard Keynes . Like any good Keynesian , Lance was corn-batting slack times by loosening up the money supply , and it worked . The carpet mills came in ? money machines themselves , as long as the market holds up ? and Calhoun 's economy took off ; for a town of its size , it has a simply enormous amount of industry , most of it new . At the same time , unremarked upon and probably unnoticed by anyone , including Lance , something else had happened . In violating orthodox banking practice for the benefit of the local economy , Bert Lance had begun to act as though the money in the bank were his own , to dispose of as he wished . " He saw the big picture a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sam C. Smith , the president of the Bartow County Bank down in Cartersville . The Bartow County Bank , like the Calhoun First National , is a new and spacious structure , and Mr. Smith shares something of Lance 's reputation for aggressive , imaginative , and civic-minded banking . He ca n't figure out what Bert Lance did wrong either . " He just did n't pay a whole lot of attention to the details , that 's all . Sure . he made a profit . He was crazy not to become the prime entrepreneur of north Georgia if he could , but I think he believed in all sincerity that what he did was good for the community . My stockholders would nail my hide to the wall if I so much as tried some of those things . You know , all banks like to be called full-service banks , but Bert . he goes out and he buys about two high -- bred bull cows and leases them to the farmers . Then he made a big joke about being a bull-service bank . Hell , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of there once . " I was already well up on the bull cow situation , having been prepped on the subject across the width of South Carolina by an old man in the dining car of the Southern Crescent . Indeed , Lance 's bulls appear to have struck a responsive chord in the southern imagination . His concern for the well-being of the small family farm echoed a popular and almost mystical regional concern . It had less to do with banking than with social policy , and it was at once entirely genuine and unusually informed : Bert Lance grew up next door to Dean Hayes , the gifted agricultural scientist . who led Gordon County and the Coosa Valley from a hopeless cotton culture to grassland cattle farming . It was at a regional planning meeting , where the policies of this remarkable man were discussed , that Lance first met a young state senator named Jimmy Carter . It is possible that Calhoun 's development might have happened anyway , without Lance , although perhaps not as rapidly . National industry may be moving from north @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ south to north , away from Atlanta and up into the Piedmont . And it is equally true , as Lance eventually discovered , that orthodox , conservative banking practices are not based on whimsy . Placing a bank 's capital at risk means that a number of bad loans are inevitably going to get written . In a small country bank like Calhoun , with poor in- terior controls and an unfortunate habit of accepting its borrowers ' word at face value , the situation could become difficult , especially when it turns out that many of the loans being written by the president were peculiar by any standard and that many of the loans written by the agricultural-loan officer , Billy Lee Campbell , were finding their way into his pocket . The loan-loss reserve was inadequate , and the bank 's liquidity position was weak ? in September , 1973 , it officially amounted to only 9.1 percent of net deposits and short-term liabilities , and even this was an overstatement . The bank was audited by the Comptroller 's office monthly in 1969 and 1970 and again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1975 , the bank entered into an agreement . An agreement with the Comptroller 's office is one cut below a cease-and-desist order and functions in much the same way , but without the element of legal coercion ? the Comptroller and his examiners badly want some things straightened out , and the bank agrees to do so . It is an extreme step and many things are involved in it , but one thing is not . There is no publicity . To protect the reputation of the banking community in general and of the offending bank in particular , the agreement is entered into and carried out under what amounts to a news blackout . As far as the public is concerned , everything is fine . N THE SURFACE , then , Bert Lance moved from strength to strength . His hometown boomed , and he himself became conspicuously prosperous . It is an interesting commentary on the hypnotic qual- ity of the American Dream that nobody questioned where his money was coming from . If one of his tellers had suddenly blossomed forth with a snazzy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an eight-track stereo , that teller would doubtless come in for some close scrutiny , but Bert Lance was able to acquire an airplane and a farm and the accouterments of wealth without anyone turning a hair . Just as generals are considered synonymous with their armies , so high corporate officers are considered synonymous with their corporations ; as the one prospers , the other prospers also . A weird reversal of common sense occurs : to wit , if the bank president turns up rich , the bank must be doing pretty well . It does not appear to have occurred to anyone in Calhoun that the hank president was paid a salary , and that this salary was of a fixed and discoverable amount , susceptible to the analysis of every citizen who ever bought a load of groceries . There was never a hint , a whisper , or a suspicion that the depositors might have been well advised to keep their money in the family mattress . When Jimmy Carter became governor , Lance followed him to Atlanta as state commissioner of transportation and did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ department . In 1974 Lance himself stood for governor and lost . It seemed like nothing but a temporary setback ; later that same year he was approached by Atlanta 's National Bank of Georgia , and in January of 1975 he became its president and chief operating officer , moving up to the chairmanship of the board at Calhoun. it is understood that a man in his mid-forties will have served his apprenticeship and be poised to make his big move , which is exactly what Lance proceeded to do with typical vim . Without pausing to train the bank 's staff , he proceeded to expand NBG 's activities to cover the entire state . He tried to branch out into international banking . He moved into agricultural commodities , lending money to Carter 's peanut business and boasting about it in his annual report under the heading " NBG Goes Nuts . " His trust department attracted an $18-million deposit from the Teamsters Union , an event that has led to much interested but so far fruitless speculation . Using the bank 's airplane in a way that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he seemed to be everywhere at once . NBC 's deposits increased by 50 percent and its assets rose from $254 million to $404 million . But he was going too fast and spreading the bank too thin . The collapse of the Atlanta real estate market had devastating effects on the bank 's loan portfolio , Lance himself made the situation worse by transferring his relatives ' funny loans down from Calhoun , and by 1978 NBG was also in trouble with the Comptroller of the Currency . That much is common knowledge , and it is on these slender but indisputable facts that Lance and his defenders base their defense . I have little doubt that Lance 's protestations of innocence arc entirely genuine . I have equally little doubt that his utterance gains its confidence and force only because Lance has not yet realized that he is a badly bewildered man . In part this is due to the nature of white-collar crime . In much larger part it is due to the tragic fact that Bert Lance is a tabula rasa on which the economic sins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Peace HITE-COLLAR CRIME is one of the easiest to commit and most difficult to prove , largely because there is little apparent dif-ference between an indict-able act and a shrewd but entirely legal business practice . Moreover , there is little drama in it ; no gaping wounds cry out for vengeance , no widows and orphans are cast into the streets to beg their bread , and the losses ( if any ) Bert Lance 's home in Atlanta . are usually covered by tax write-offs and insurance payments . The perpetrator is often a splendid fellow , while the victim is usually large and impersonally corporate and unlikely to command much in the way of popular sympathy . In the mind of conservative and liberal alike there lurks the suspicion that property per se is a form of theft and its acquisition a form of burglary in a moral vacuum , so the white-collar criminal is merely stealing from a thief . This delusion is a useful one , especially as it pertains to juries . Second , it is entirely possible that Bert Lance has only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crook ? even a white-collar one ? sets out to steal a million dollars , hr does so in terms of a plan that is relatively simple and easily held in the mind . Details may multiply , and he may add refinements as the occasion warrants , but there is about the whole an elegant symmetry . Ire starts with point A ? not having a million dollars ? and proceeds by stages to point B having a million dollars . In the matter of T. Bertram Lance . however , we are confronted with a complexity that borders on chaos ? which does much to account for the rather fuzzy impression in the minds of the public and the press that if he 's guilty of anything he 's guilty of treating the Calhoun First National like a slum tenement building , with himself in the role of landlord . Even the redoubtable members of the Senate 's Governmental Affairs Committee , 14 ith a large staff of aides at their disposal , seized upon the , comparatively trivial matter of Lance 's airplane and his bank-subsidized trips to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airplane was a convenient target for Senatorial fulminations , but because it was a simple object that took off from one clearly defined place , landed in another , and was thus comprehensible . Another thing that may have clouded the perception of the public servants was that Bert Lance was one of them , too . When it came to borrowing and spending other people 's money , lie behaved not unlike the United States Congress . Bert Lance was the hedgehog who knows one big thing . The only money that is real is the money in your pocket . All other money , though useful , is fictitious . And so , like the United States Congress , he went on a spree . The Calhoun First National was n't in the least like a slum tenement . Nor was it like a credit card ? another tempting but misleading analogy that has appeared in the press . Rent rolls and credit cards are finite , but in the American banking system , Bert Lance discovered the Philosopher 's Stone . His claim dim he wrote it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of it down . There are a couple ofgood reasons for this . One is that an honest man has nothing to hide . and Bert Lance 's conviction of his own honesty is as inseparable from his person as his nose and his foot . Moreover , he can prove it : not only did he write most of it down ( after all , everyone has something to hide ) , but his depositors did n't lose a cent . But there is a second and highly practical reason for all the meticulous record-keeping . Computers and bookkeepers are alike in that they know only what you tell them , but to complete your transactions they must be furnished with precise and accurate information . Furthermore , because many of Lance 's transactions involved debts that were supposed to be repaid someday and because they were conducted through the medium of banks that need to know the status of their money , this information had to be stored and be retrievable . ( But not all of it . Bookkeepers and computers share another , similar quality : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know it . It is a mechanical flaw they hold in common with hank examiners . If one does n't look in a file , he will have little idea of what it contains . I Because the information was thus compiled and stored , it eventually found its way into the public record , and it reposes there still . The public record in question consists of five volumes issued by the Government Printing Office , bound in green paper and containing a flood of testimony , reams of photocopied Cank statements , memorandums , letters , facsimiles of canceled checks , bank examiners ' reports , interviews by the Senate staff and the in. vestigative branch of the Internal Revenue Service , news stories , the relevant columns by William Safire , representative samples of the Manufacturers Han- over Trust Company 's newsletter , deeds of property , transaction reports , and the list of allegations eventually brought by the Comptroller and the Securities and Exchange Commission . It is , in short , a sort of fiduciary War and Peace made up of facts , informed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staggering amount of worthless garbage . I suppose it is a wonderful thing that we have so much information available to us in this free land ; the rub comes when you try to sift through it and find out what it all means . Sherlock Holmes once remarked that a bankbook is a compressed diary . Holmes was right as usual , but he was engaged in the relatively straightforward case of a noble spinster who ended up chloroformed in the false bottom of a coffin . There are enough bankbooks in the public record to fill the library at Alexandria . Properly winnowed , they afford a fascinating peep into the financial portion of Bert Lance 's mind , but the proper winnowing takes time , and the final result yields none of those spectacular revaluations of the " this is a stickup " variety so beloved by the watchdogs of the public weal ? which does much to explain why the watchdogs of the public - weal seem to have had such a hard time understanding the sins of Bert Lance , much less explaining them . What emerges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a man solving problems in highly inventive , possibly illegal ways . Certainly they were unwise . But they worked . And there is a discernible pattern . A credit to his family T TOOK ME three months two months to wade through the material and a month to make sense of it ? and the gist of what I discovered is this : in America , it is expected that a rich man will owe a large sum of money . From this it is but a single step to assuming that a man 's indebtedness reflects his wealth ; if someone owes his creditors a sum equivalent to the gross national product of the Republic of Chad , it is logical if not correct to assume that he has either the cash or the assets to discharge his obligations . If some of these loans are being paid with other , new loans , a curious thing happens : as long as a man is able to move his funds around smoothly , he will have an excellent credit rating . Never mind that the funds so pledged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is purchased with borrowed money , often the very money of the loan in question , which causes both loan and collateral to function something like a giant miibius strip ? in these matters , appearance is reality . In other words , credit is stupid ( as love is blind ) , and a lending institution is the easiest thing in the world to keep happy : all you have to do is pay it . It can not be stressed too strongly that this payment is made in the form of numbers rather than bullion and specie , a circumstance that holds out the possibility of many ingenious and lucrative refinements ? but the American credit system is a rich lode even when exploited crudely . It is probable that Lance first began to learn of the fictitious nature of money when he discovered that he 'd married not only LaBelle , but LaBelle 's grandpa 's bank and LaBelle 's family . Although the members of the latter doubtless have many sterling qualities , commercial ability is not among them . If old Mr. David had a flaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who would n't lend a young carpet manufacturer $300 to establish a line of credit was also a parent indulgent to such a degree that his offspring and their children got some very peculiar ideas about where money comes from . If the younger Davids wanted something ? a car is one example that sticks in the mind ? they simply wrote a check for it . The check was invariably good . By the time the third generation rolled around , this miracle had lost its luster and become common practice , like electricity . Here one sees the national character at work again : the Davids are a microcosm of the estrange. ment that has recently occurred between the workman and his hire . It is n't the Davids ' fault that they did n't excel at gainful work , but they expected nevertheless to be able to maintain a comfortable middle-class life-style that they were n't earning . A middle-class life-style has become something of a national birthright . and the Davids ' unquestioning acceptance of one based on easy access to a bank full of other people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's unshakable conviction that he deserves to make as much money as an architect . OM B. DAVID , LaBelle 's uncle , after whom the local airport is named , was the most solvent of the lot ? a relative statement if there ever was one . Although he served as chair- man of the executive committee at the Calhoun bank and drew an executive salary he and his wife consistently overdrew their two checking accounts until , in March , 1975 , the overdrafts exceeded $230,000 . That same month , Lance arranged for NBG to loan Mr. David the coincidental sum of $230,000 . The stated purpose of the loan was to provide money for investment . In actuality , it was used to pay down the overdraft at Calhoun . Borrowing money with inadequate collateral ( or none ) and using it for a purpose not stated in the relevant documentation are features common to many Lance-related loans , and when the loans involved his wife 's family , he took care to make sure that his name would appear nowhere in the pertinent files at NBG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the NBC loan has been prompt and reliable . But the best thing that can be said about the rest of LaBelle 's kinfolk is that having a bank president in the family is preferable to going on welfare . Starting no later than 1967 and continuing throughout his tenure , Lance arranged for Calhoun to , in effect , give his in-laws hundreds of thousands of dollars in the form of overdrafts and loans . It was almost as though they were his children and he was giving them an allowance ; although he had no written power of attorney from any of them , he exercised substantial control over their financial affairs ; lie juggled their hooks without telling them about it , and he caused money to appear in their accounts as though by magic . From some time in 1968 until November , 1974 , he arranged for loans totaling $180,820 to he placed at the disposal of his brother-in-law , Beverly Banks David , although the money was only partially secured and B. B. David could n't possibly have repaid it . Instead , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in B. B. David 's name , and that eventually became overdrawn to the tune of $18,018 . Practicing the kind of hall-of-mirrors economics that soon became second nature to him , Lance frequently paid down the overdraft by means of new loans , while the overdraft itself had been created by having to pay down previous loans . B. B. David 's living expenses were covered by a joint account that was likewise almost continually overdrawnd an replenished with loans . The overdraft on this account eventually reached $55,383 . Following B. B. David 's suicide in 1974 , both accounts were closed with a loan of $75,000 from the Citizens and Southern Bank , where Lance enjoyed influence . Claude Barker ? David , another of Lance 's brothers-in-law , tried his hand at this and that , but fortune did not smile on him . David 's Gifts and Antiques , an enterprise that he ran out of his home until 1969 , failed to flourish . C. B. David then founded a construction company . It must have seemed like a good idea ; Bert 's boom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magnates were beginning to erect numbers of large , uninteresting homes on the crest of the hill but for some reason the David Construction Company failed to get a piece of the action . From 1971 to 1974 , C. B. David and his wife were out of work . Then they took over Barker 's Flower House and ran it until 1977 , but they were unable to generate enough income to cover their living expenses . In the real world , such a situation usually ends with the hapless pair throwing themselves on the mercy ' of their family or becoming wards of the state , but we are dealing with Calhoun , where they became wards of the bank instead . Between 1967 and 1970 , Lance arranged for Calhoun to extend personal loans totaling approximately $113,000 . Between 1968 and 1969 , David 's Gifts and Antiques received an additional $32,000 , andapproximately $109,000 went to the David Construction Company in 1970 . While the loans remained at Calhoun , the interest was frequently paid through one or more of five checking accounts , four of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The fifth , a special account , was opened by Lance in C. B. David 's name but without C. B. David 's knowledge . Lance neglected to send him any of its financial statements ? something that , under the circumstances , seems like an excess of tact . All five accounts were chronically overdrawn , the total reaching a sum well over $100,000 in 1975 . In addition to the interest payments to Calhoun , the money went to pay interest on some non-Calhoun loans and to subsidize Mr. and Mrs. David 's life-style . An additional $40,000 went into the refurbishing of Eagle 's Nest , a cottage on Lance 's farm . It was the least they could do for him , all things considered . During 1975 and 1976 , Lance covered the interest checks with his own money , and the overdrafts on three of the accounts were eliminated on paper by a further infusion of his money combined with transfers from the other C. B. David accounts , an $80,000 loan to Rita David from the Northwest Georgia Bank at Ringgold , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's mother-in-law , from that same institution . This last loan came as something of a surprise to Mrs. Chance when it was called to her attention in 1977 . Lance had control of her affairs , too . The remaining $34,000 of the Ringgold loan went to cover overdrafts in her account . Mrs. Chance had no significant source of income . She did , however , have a husband , Ronald F. Chance , who wanders into the story briefly on February 7 , 1977 . On that date be appeared at the main office of the National Bank of Georgia with the news that his stepson-in-law had arranged for him to borrow $125,000 . Although Mr. Chance could n't remember the name of the loan officer he was supposed to see , NBG gave him the money anyway . It was used to pay off a loan at the Cohutta Banking Company in Chatsworth , an institution that , like Northwest Georgia in . Ringgold , numbered among its major shareholders Lance and his associates . The Cohutta loan had been used to pay off a loan at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unfortunately . Mr. Chance turned out not to have $125,000 when the NBC loan reached maturity , and he was compelled to sell 43.8 acres of his land to the Georgia Department of Transportation , by coincidence the very agency Lance had purged and reorganized during his tenure as its chief . In May , 1977 , also in response to the Comptroller 's criticism , Mrs. Chance 's Calhoun indebtedness was transferred to NBG ; the indebtedness totaled $126,225 , and it was accompanied by the proviso that Calhoun would buy it back later . That same month , $214,550 of C. B. David 's debts made a similar migration . On December 29 , 1978 , following the sale of real estate , a write-off of $16,000 , and two payments , a balance of $168,542 remained outstanding with no likelihood of repayment short of the total liquidation of C. B. David 's assets . If the Comptroller 's man had n't tracked the money down , it is possible that no repayments whatever would have been made , nor would any property have been sold . Lance has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarterly installments of $5.000 plus interest , and he has hired C. B. David as his office manager . Until the Comptroller 's office finally immobilized it and demanded repayment , all this money had a strange dual nature . It existed , and at the same time it did n't . That is , it existed in the sense that LaBelle 's relatives spent it , and it did n't exist in the sense that it was nothing but numbers on the books at Calhoun ? numbers that waxed and waned in response to the addition and subtraction of other numbers , but that never came home to roost . In sustaining his in-laws , Lance juggled . Still , what we encounter here is scarcely the malevolent subtlety of a criminal intellect ; we encounter the maneuvers of a nice guy with a bunch of expensive in-laws , a nice guy who once again just happens to be acting as though the assets of his hank represented his personal fortune . It was both his blind side and his inheritance . When he stepped into old Mr. David 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ F ? Lance 's home in the Georgetown section o/ Washington , D.C. obligations and old Mr. David 's way of meeting them , and his options at the beginning were precisely two : he could stop using the bank to support the Davids and trust to luck ( i.e. , that the crows would feed LaBelle 's kinfolk and the foxes pay their rent ) , or he could continue as before . Continuity had one great advantage . It worked . And the lessons it taught could be applied in many ways . In September , 1974 , Calhoun loaned Lance 's son , David , $45,000 on a demand basis . David Lance was nineteen years old . The following year he increased his indebtedness to $99,236 . On the various occasions when the young man found himself unable to meet the interest payments on this stupendous sum , his father made them for him . One wonders why . David Lance had plenty of spending money . During 1974 and 1975 , his monthly overdrafts ran as high as $11,000 . Playing Ping-Yong T IS EASY , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accuse Lance and his retinue of simple greed or , at best , the sort of bloody-minded euphoria that char- acterized the German submarines during the " Happy Time " of 1940 and 1941 , but this is to forget context . The Calhoun bank had ' been a closed proposition for a long , long time , and Bert Lance was a splendid fellow . It takes money to make money , after all , and with certain modifications the method used to keep the Davids fed and clothed could be used for the benefit of all . First , however , it was necessary to secure the bank itself by making its books look as good as possible , but the loan Ping-Ponging that maintained the Davids suggested a way in which this might be done ; otherwise , the conservative men and women in the Comptroller 's corps of examiners might well put a severe crimp in Lance 's plans . Therefore , between June , 1970 , and December , 1974 , Calhoun put its entire installment loan portfolio to ransom and obtained $3 million from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased to $5 million . The loan was represented as a sale of loan participations , but it was nothing of the sort ; it simply served to deceive the examiners about the bank 's liquidity , and Calhoun 's obligation to pay off the debt was nowhere reflected in its books . By means of an identical understanding , it borrowed $700,000 from the National Bank and Trust Company of Chattanooga in January , 1970 , $825,000 in February , and $625,000 in March . In December , 1970 , Calhoun obtained $500,000 from the First National Bank of Rome , Georgia , and in December , 1971 , it received $1 million . Since all these moneys were returned to their source after a few days , during which they fooled the examiners , for all practical purposes they had no existence except on paper . The Fulton loan was finally paid back in January , 1975 . It was just numbers , too . With the Comptroller 's office thus successfully bamboozled with fictitious money and a Ping-Ponging network established , it became possible for a well-connected customer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect on the bank 's liquidity , especially if the well-connected customer also happened to be a director of the bank . The loans could always be farmed out to other banks at the end of the year and repurchased later , when the coast was clear . In this manner , among the loans granted to a tire dealership , a manufacturer of small rugs and bedspreads , and a carpet and yarn dye factory , all affiliated with Calhoun directors , were loans or loan renewals totaling $1.15 million . Of this sum , $810,000 was temporarily transferred to friendly banks and not recorded as a Calhoun habil ? ity . It was all in a good cause , the furtherance of Bert 's boom . And , yes , Bert was crazy not to become the prime entrepreneur of north Georgia if he could . He also did n't have to . He had the bank . Lance and his wife maintained four accounts there : Lance 's regular and special accounts , LaBelle Lance 's special account , and the account of Lancelot and Company , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lance controlled all four accounts and used them interchangeably . Still , Lance held off ; both habits and delusions take a while to form , and it was n't until 1972 , when his experience with loan manipulation seemed to prove the bank 's capacity to generate any reasonable sum of money , that the overdrafts began . Like all good leaders , Lance made certain that the troops were served and the position was secure before sitting down to dinner himself . The overdrafts in his own accounts and in that of Lancelot were relatively modest , peaking in the $20,000 ? $30,000 range . The overdrafts in the LaBelle Lance account were somewhat more ambitious , finally reaching $110,000 in November , 1974 , the year Lance ran for governor . The interesting thing about these figures is that , like Poe 's purloined letter , they are so ordinary in the context in which Lance was then operating that they become invisible . Lance was rich and nobody cared . In 1974 , Bert Lance 's salary at the Calhoun First National Bank was $37,900 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lance was a generous man . If a good thing seemed to do no harm , he let everybody do it . In 1974 , Calhoun 's extensions of credit to its officers , directors , and director nominees amounted to 43.44 percent of the bank 's total equity capital . In 1975 , the figure rose to 73.08 percent . Based on the information supplied by the bank , the SEC was unable to determine whether these lines of credit included overdrafts or whether the overdrafts should beadded to these figures , thereby reducing even further the bank 's liquidity position . Lance moved to NBG in 1975 . That was also the year when the agreement with the Comptroller 's office seemingly halted the overdrafts . But it was as though Lance could n't stop himself . Although it appears to make no sense at all , Lance arranged matters so that he was able to foil the examiners and write , between January , 1976 , and August , 1977 , 1,146 checks totaling $2.058,721 . Each check would have created an overdraft in his Calhoun account , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day in order to allow sufficient funds to be transferred from his NBG account ? funds that were themselves largely illusory , consisting as they did of the proceeds from his many loans . During some of this time he was the second most powerful man in the federal government . Campaigns and computers LTHOUGH LANCE 'S OVERDRAFTS provided him with ready cash for living expenses , loan payments , and margin calls on various securities , it was not the best of the many ways a bank could be used for profit and good works . Lance was learning all the time . With the bank 's help , you could even run for governor . During the course of Lance 's abortive run in 1974 , his campaign committees wrote ( and the bank cleared ) more than 625 hot checks in at least two accounts . At least ten of them , intrinsically worthless though they were , found their way straight back to Calhoun in the form of payments to reimburse the bank for the airplane rental , computer equipment , and staff salaries the bank generously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank computer forms , and equipment rental . The deficit created in the bank 's hooks by these shenanigans was then washed out , like the drawing on a child 's magic slate , before the annual accounting was presented to the stockholders . A federal statute , 18 USC 610 ( since repealed ) , quite clearly states that it is unlawful for any national bank to make an expenditure , loan , or advance in connection with any election . Paying for an airplane , computer equipment , and campaign workers is an advance . Accepting payment for these things with hot checks constitutes an expenditure . Hot checks themselves are a loan until they are written off , at which point they , too , become an expenditure . Statute 18 USC 610 , like Lance 's use of bank aircraft , has the virtue of being clear and straightforward and was consequently the focus of considerable Republican uproar when the Senate began looking into his affairs . Because of its unambiguous nature and because a violation constitutes damage to the public weal , 18 USC 610 was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lance has been charged with . Unfortunately , the statute of limitations under this law runs only three years . Although Lance 's activities were the subject of two grand jury investigations stretching over months and the language of the resulting indictments is almost identical to that contained in a report published by the SEC and the Comptroller 's office as long ago as May , 1978 , in which the campaign irregularities were clearly spelled out , 18 USC 610 was allowed to expire before Lance could be charged under it . There are other ways of raising campaign money , and Lance 's experience with the Lancelot Company suggested at least one way in which this might be done . With two of his friends and co-indictees , Thomas Mitchell and a Calhoun druggist named Jack Mullins , Lance formed the L &; M Company , a partnership designed to pay off campaign debts by means of security and commodity investments . Naturally enough , L &; M did its banking business at Calhoun , and during 1975 and 1976 , also naturally enough , its account was overdrawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point reaching approximately $45,000 . Some of the money was expended on the stocks and the commodities , but the rest was used to pay down campaign loans and should be added to the $245,478.26 I the aggregate overdraft highs of the campaign committee 's three accounts ) as part of the bank 's advances , both during the campaign and afterward . In addition , L &; M obtained $60,000 in the form of a loan to Mullins from the First State Bank of Gilmer County . $13,000 of which was transferred to Lance to pay down the committee overdrafts . The Lancelot Company acquired $100,000 from the same bank for the same purpose , and a final $40,000 came from Gilmer as a loan paid directly to Mullins , who in turn gave it directly to Lance . Jack Mullins was a good friend , and his expressed enthusiasm for a constitutional amendment that would forbid reporters from finding out things is understandable and justified . On November 3 , 1975 , Lance arranged for him to receive $40,000 on an unsecured basis from NBG to make personal investments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overdrafts at Calhoun . Mullins later obtained another Calhoun loan to purchase from the same bank 875 shares held by two charitable institutions and a trustee for a hospital . Lance had previously donated these shares while he was state transportation commissioner , in keeping with his public promise to give the equivalent of his salary from that post to good causes . In November , 1976 , NBG loaned Mullins an additional $185,715 , of which approximately $50,750 was used to consolidate the previous three loans while the remainder went to pay off more than $130,000 in loans from Calhoun . Mullins had an income of less than $25,000 a year . A numberof his interest payments were made by donations from Lance , funneled through L &; M. In 1978 , at the Comptroller 's insistence , Mullins sold his coin collection and a number of stocks and paid NBG $74,038 . Mullins had told NBG that the purpose of the loans was to buy coins and stock , and he overstated his net worth ? small tricks of the trade that he either learned from Bert Lance or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assets are somewhat crude devices , however , and at NBG Lance was dealing with an institution far more porous than the one at Calhoun . NBG was much larger , much less susceptible to his total personal control , and a nervous employee or stockholder could cause no end of inconvenience . Mullins 's loans , therefore , were secured in a third way , as were the loans to Tom B. and C. B. David , Ruth and Ronald Chance , and various Calhoun officers , including Lance 's successor , Y. A. Henderson . In granting them the money , NBG took into consideration Calhoun 's correspondent balance . ORRESPONDENT BALANCES are moneys banks keep on deposit at other , friendly banks . The use of these sizable sums is intended to compensate the depository for services rendered to the depositor ? clearing customer checks , foreign-exchange trading , debt collection , the use of wire and computer services , and the training of officers in areas where the depository bank has greater expertise , among others . When an individual borrows a large amount of money from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a substantial deposit , called a compensating balance . This money provides the bank with an additional source of income over and above the interest on the loan , and it serves as an earnest of the borrower 's solvency and his determination to repay his debt . Although the practice is strictly forbidden , it goes without saying that if a comparatively insolvent borrower can somehow find a way to substitute a hank 's correspondent balance for a personal compensating balance that he ca n't afford , the bank may very well discover a hitherto unsuspected willingness to part with gratifying quantities of rash . And if an ostensibly solvent borrower can work the same trick , he will end up with all that much more disposable capital . The trouble was , Calhoun 's correspondent balances were based on an asset structure that was to a significant extent the figment of a computer 's imagination . A correspondent balance is not conveyed to its point of deposit by burly , trustworthy men carrying bags of specie . Thanks to a miracle of modern electronics , numbers are deducted at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second . While this commendably speedy practice enables banks to communicate with the velocity of light , it has a built-in flaw : because a computer is incapable of lying , it is assumed that the numbers are truthful In other words , the computer is treated much like a person of unquestionable rectitude and probity . That 's absolutely crazy ; a computer is n't trustworthy , it 's an idiot savant , trusting and dumb and possessed of a prodigious memory . Computers are programmed by people . People are very complicated . They forget things , and they lie . Calhoun 's books were bolstered by upwards of $5 million in nonexistent assets . Between half and three-quarters of its equity capital was on loan to its officers . The president 's in-laws had run up hundreds of thousands of dollars in bad debts that were being kept alive with hot checks that created overdrafts that were covered with further loans . Millions of dollars in other loans were simply being stored elsewhere , in disguise . Lance 's campaign committees were drinking deeply at the well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's books were just that : numbers , reflecting nothing that existed , and when they were moved around in the form of correspondent balances , the traffic consisted in large part of fairy gold . The recipient institution received an assumption , and the assumption was wrong . They were nonetheless numbers with singular power . Watered though Calhoun 's correspondent balances were , they functioned much like flogiston and caloric , hypothetical and purely apocryphal substances that produced an effect that was real . For example , they made it possible to buy some banks . In 1972 , using Calhoun 's correspondent balance to obtain personal loans at Fulton National , Lance and four Calhoun directors purchased 25 percent of the outstanding shares of Cohutta , the bank that was later so accommodating to Lance 's father-in-law . The following year they added a partner and used the same method to buy a controlling interest in Northwest Georgia at Ringgold . Richard Carr , another of Lance 's co-indictees , moved there as its president . In order to qualify for membership on the board of directors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquiring the $12,000 purchase price by means of an unsecured demand note at Calhoun ; as usual , no purpose for the loan was given . By October , 1974 , Carr 's Calhoun indebtedness had risen to more than $120,000. on none of which had he paid down a penny of principal . Carr then began to borrow from NBC , where Lance , always happy to oblige his friends and associates , had providentially been installed as president . Carr began with a $67,500 no-purpose loan in April , 1975 , and used the proceeds to open a correspondent account . By February , 1976 , Carr 's NBG indebtedness had reached $122,747 and he had attracted the Comptroller 's attention both there and at Calhoun . It was a simple matter , however , for NBG to arrange for Citizens and Southern to loan Carr $250,000 , with which he was able to wipe the slate clean . NBG rewarded C &S; by opening a correspondent account , agreed to reloan Carr enough money within a year , to pay off his debt , and did so . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , NBC discovered that Carr 's financial statement had failed to list $204,000 in additional debts , and that a farm listed as a $195,000 asset was actually owned by Carr 's wife and her mother . His collateral consisted of 8,035 shares of Northwest Georgia stock and a second mortgage on his home . NBG was unable to sell either the stock or the house , and Can was unable to service his loan . Dead Sea fruit LT . THIS looks pretty stupid in retrospect , but as long as Bert Lance was still in control and not under investigation , it worked well . The question of how far he had moved into the realm of fantasy is probably moot as far as the law is concerned , but the indica-tions are that he was far gone . He was clearly aware that tampering with the books at Calhoun , loaning the Davids large sums , and using the bank to run for governor were highly questionable practices , and he took appropriate precautions ; a man who lakes precautions usually has a fair idea of what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good . But elsewhere he encouraged or allowed Mullins and Carr to take appalling risks ( Mitchell , a careful man , is something of an enigma ) , and he took appalling risks 11 " himself . Loan roll-overs and Ping-Ponging became his standard manner of conducting his personal business ; he was careless when it came to details . His rationalizations are easy to imagine . Because it was aboveboard , it must have been honest . Because lie was a poor detail man , any slip could be excused as a mistake . Because his credit was good and the roll-overs remained easy , everybody further down the line got paid , although the snowball kept getting larger . The money kept coming in . It was business . Using Calhoun 's correspondent balance , he was able to obtain $725,794 from Fulton between 1963 and 1972 . He borrowed $73,000 from the Hamilton Bank of Dalton . He borrowed $140,000 from the Farmers &; Merchant Bank in Summerville . He borrowed 5133,120 from the Cobb County Bank in Powder Springs . He borrowed $250,000 from the Roswell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Bank of Brunswick . He borrowed $389,820 from Northwest Georgia . He borrowed $85,000 from the First National Bank in Rome . He borrowed $40,000 from the National City Bank of Rome . He borrowed $1,377,494 from the Georgia Railroad Bank in Augusta . He borrowed $16,000 from the Harwick Bank in Dalton . He borrowed $83,000 from the Clayton County Bank in Riverdale . He borrowed $75,000 from the Hamilton Bank in Atlanta . On an autumn day in 1970 , he borrowed $618.500 from the American National Bank in Chattanooga . He borrowed $100,000 from the Gilmer County Bank . He borrowed $175,000 from the Trust Company Rank in Atlanta . He borrowed $443,467 from the United American Bank in Knoxville . He borrowed $300,000 from his friend Thomas Mitchell . He also pocketed $58,000 raised at the Bert Lance Appreciation Dinner . It covered an overdraft . All this reminds me of a modified Ponzi scheme , and it is in the nature of Ponzi schemes to look terribly obvious only when the last bluff is called , the string has run out , and it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , are discovered to consist of nothing but Dead Sea fruit . Certainly there appeared to be nothing amiss with Bert Lance in the eyes of the presumably hard-nosed and intelligent officers of the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company when he approached them in April of 1975 with a proposal that , with one exception , was to crown his career as a professional debtor : the Big Loan , which eventually worked out to $2,625,000 . Although Lance had never gone for a single pot of that size before , he carried on much as usual . His financial statement reflected a net worth of $3,453,777 when his net worth was actually only $2,043,998 and much of that consisted of stocks and property bought with the proceeds of loans . He doubled in brass by making an identical application at Citibank , N.A. , then NBG 's principal New York correspondent , business he then proceeded to promise Manufacturers . Citibank refused to make the loan . On April 29 , NBG opened a correspondent account at Manufacturers . On June 30 , Lance got his money . The loan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shares the loan was to be used to purchase ? and 8,375 shares of Calhoun . In addition , the bank asked for assignments of death benefits from Lance 's life insurance and requested a signed undertaking that he would remain president of NBC for the duration of the loan . The bank and , specifically , a vice-president named Betsy Jo Viener then learned what it was like to loan money to Bert Lance . First , 4,000 shares of the Calhoun stock turned out to be registered in the name of the Lancelot Company . Viener first called the Lancelot situation to Lance 's attention in July and was still calling it to his attention the following October . The purpose statement was signed but not completed . There was endless trouble over the life insurance . Lance skipped a $21,911.46 interest payment . He failed to forward a stock dividend of 14,811 shares . Viener tried to track him down at the ABA convention and missed him . Then he failed to pick up his telephone . She sent him forms carefully marked with an X so lie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is not recorded if he did so . Unlike a dunning notice from the electric company , however , all of this correspondence was characterized by a cordial. ity befitting a transaction in excess of lwo and a half million bucks ; someone who does n't pay his electric bill is treated quite nastily , but a man who fudges the details on a multimillion-dollar loan generally is not . Lance could n't have given the stock dividend to Manufacturers if he 'd wanted to , by the way . He 'd already used it as collateral on a $150,000 loan from the Chemical Bank . Maybe it could have gone on forever . By this time , however , Lance clearly had gone too far . His appetite for money was unabated. and now he was operating on a national scale . In December , 1976 , NBG opened a correspondent account at the First National Bank of Chicago . Simultaneously , NBC 's correspondent account at Manufacturers underwent a dramatic shrinkage . On January 6 , 1977 , the First National Bank of Chicago loaned Bert Lance $3,425,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1977 , the day after the Chicago loan , Lance prepared a financial statement . It alleged that his net worth on that date was $2,624,558 . It was nothing of the sort . He underestimated his liabilities by $1,213,533 . Thus , Lance 's actual net worth was $1,411,025.11 all his contingent liabilities are included in the total , Bert Lance 's net worth on January 7 , 1977 , was minus $372,992 . I suppose this only goes to prove that Max Beerbohm was right when he said we are who we pretend to be , and therefore it is important to pretend to be something rather splendid . Lance had pretended to be rich , and ? hey , presto ? he was . If events had n't intervened he might be a rich man still . Cod only knows how many others there are like him , so many emperors of ice cream . Their fortunes are out there somewhere even now , shunting through the relays and winging over the wires , and unless the electricity finally fails for good , they may never know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have come for Bert Lance at all for at least , then ) if he had n't decided to go to Washington and pretend to be something else . A piggy bank HON1CALLY , HE WAS almost undone by a computer and a thief . In July , 1975 , Lance discovered that the agricultural-loan officer at Calhoun , a man named Billy Lee Campbell , had his hand in the till . Lance immediately informed the FBI . Fie was later to remind his accusers of this again and again : he himself had called in the cops ; he himself had taken the only course open to a responsible citizen . There never was much doubt about Campbell 's guilt ; starting on February 4 , 1971 , and progressing steadily from point A to point B , he had helped himself to some $994,00-1.02 . While Lance and his associates were turning Calhoun 's assets into the stuff of dreams , Billy Lee Campbell drained off real cash , and in this old-fashioned manner . Calhoun 's affairs came under the highly interested scrutiny of a young federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention of the federal attorney 's office in Atlanta had been drawn to Calhoun some time before , when a colleague of Bogart 's received a copy of a memo written by John Sherry of the Enforcement and Compliance Section of the Comptroller 's office . Among other things , it described the hot checks written by the campaign committees , the disguised disbursements of funds , and the washing out of the books . Bogart read it over . Then he sent to Calhoun for a list of Campbell 's overdrafts . The bank 's computer responded with an embarrassment of riches . it sent a printout of Campbell 's overdrafts , all right , but on that printout was included the overdrafts of every other officer in the bank , including Bert Lance . What the hell is this ? thought Bogart . He read the printout again . Then he picked up the Sherry memorandum . My God , he thought . That 's not a bank . It 's a piggy bank . He did n't know the half of it . It seemed likely that as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going to have to seek an indictment of his star witness , Bert Lance . Bogart immediately began to negotiate a plea fur Campbell . On October 29 , 1976 , Billy Lee Campbell was sentenced to eight years in prison . Meanwhile , Bogart sent an FBI agent named Richard Ramsby to Calhoun with a subpoena for the bank 's board of director minutes and the auditor reports on the accounts of its officers , employees , and their families going hack to January 1 , 1970 : Y. A. Henderson , Lance 's successor , told Ramsby that the records in question were not in the bank because they had been sent to the Comptroller 's office in Washington . This was either very bold or very careless of Mr. Henderson , because they appear to have been reposing only a few feet from his desk , but his declaration had the effect of reducing Bogart 's investigation to a snail 's pace . Bogart made a mistake . He assumed that Henderson was telling the truth , and instead of ordering Ramsby to turn the bank upside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and requested the documents . Another ease intervened , and it was not until November 19 , two weeks after Bert Lance 's best friend had been elected President of the United States , that Bogart returned to the file and discovered that Miller had not replied . Bogart phoned Washington . Miller told him that Justice did n't have the documents . He also advanced the novel theory that 18 USC 610 applied only to federal elections . Bogart called the Comptroller 's office . The Comptroller 's office expressed ignorance of any documents . Bogart called Justice again . Justice said no , the documents were at the Comptroller 's . Bogart called the Comptroller 's office . This time he hit pay dirt ; copies of the documents had been found and would be sent along , but first the Comptroller 's office wanted a formal request from the U.S. attorney . Bogart typed two letters . The first informed Robert Bloom , the acting Comptroller , that he had the case under investigation . The second , prepared for the signature of Bogart 's chief , John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running . Stokes , a Republican , hoped to complete twenty years of federal service in order to qualify for his pension , and he was actively lobbying with Griffin Bell and others to achieve this result . Stokes did n't sign the letter . On December 2 , he transferred the Calhoun case to himself and closed it the same day . When the FBI called on him later that month as part of the background investigation of Bert Lance , potential government employee , Stokes was able to assure the investigators that the government had declined to prosecute . What he said was entirely true . Jeffrey Bogart has since left federal service . Meanwhile , Lance had not been idle on his own behalf . Whatever delusions he might have entertained about the solidity of his personal fortune , one fact was concrete and undeniable : the bank at Calhoun remained subject to the agreement , and the agreement did not look good . On November 22 , he visited Donald Tarleton , the Comptroller 's regional administrator , in his office in Atlanta . During the course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was about to become the second most powerful man in Washington . Shortly after Lance took his leave , Tarleton canceled the agreement . Robert Bloom was not terribly pleased with Tarleton 's action regional administrators do not , as a rule , cancel agreements , and Calhoun still was n't in the best of shape . But Lance continued to lead a charmed life ; fortune may or may not favor the brave , but it definitely exhibits a strong bias in favor of those who have the ear of the king . Bloom , a career civil servant who had never once been the subject of a raid or even a feeler from the private sector , badly wanted to be appointed Comptroller for real . Instead of reimposing the agreement , he removed the Calhoun file from its usual place and locked it in the safe in his office bathroom . When it appeared that the Wall Street Journal had gotten wind of the affair , he cleared a press release with Lance 's lawyer , and when the FBI came calling with the background investigation , Bloom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 18 , 1977 , he informed the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee that , in his opinion , Bert Lance would make a swell director of the Office of Management and Budget . Bloom later said that he did n't want to be the skunk at the garden party . On the other hand , he did n't get to be Comptroller of the Currency either . Sins of omission Y THE MIDDLE of 1977 , Bert Lance 's illusory fortune was melting like Brigadoon at sunrise . The market value of his stock had declined , and precisely because he was the second most powerful man in the government he was unable to keep it moving except in one potentially disastrous way : he had to sell it . He had to sell it because , as part of the price he had to pay to enter an Administration dedicated to small-town virtues , he had unequivocally promised to do so by the last hour of the last day of the year . Here , if anywhere , lies the definitive proof of the state of Bert Lance 's conscience ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or may not have been aware that only luck in the form of one man 's pension and another 's ambition had gotten Bogart off his trail and deflected the FBI and the Senate , but his actions were supremely confident . No one had ever laid a hand on him , he was always the man he pretended to be , and he gave a star performance . When he returned to the Governmental Affairs Committee to request an extension of his deadline , he was nothing but a friendly man with an irksome problem that could be banished with a word . There was n't a Senator on the committee who seemed reluctant to utter it . And so Bert Lance stepped directly into a trap laid 200 years ago by James Madison . The committee might have been willing to say the word , but there was the small matter of the press , particularly that segment of the press where the columns of a former Nixon speechwriter appeared . In these matters it is important to give the appearance of being fair , and especially so in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , another small matter , but one that brought Mr. Madison 's separation of powers into lull play . Bert Lance should have known that , too , but his career has been one of many such telling omissions . He did n't stop giving his in-laws money . He failed to keep his bank solvent . He could n't stop writing checks . He could n't stop borrowing money . He could n't write accurate financial statements . Now , it appears , he had failed to read the Constitution of the United States . Once the investigation began , there was no way anyone in the Executive branch could stop it . The green books began to fill . Bert Lance had forgotten something else . Computers can be programmed to lie , but they also write down everything they know .
