Four and a half million Americans , according to a National Broadcasting Co. survey , are lolling awake at home at 1 o'clock every morning . And what do they have to watch on television ? Little more than faded black-and-white movies interrupted by supercharged hawkers of old cars . Last week NBC started offering something else : a network early early talk show that runs Monday through Thursday from 1 a.m. to 2 a.m . E.D.T. , immediately following the Tonight show and a few hours before the Today show . It is called ( what else ? ) Tomorrow . <P> Network censors , like almost everyone else , are a little less upright in the wee hours ; thus Tomorrow plans to focus on controversial subjects and straight , even abrasive talk . " The Tonight audience wants to be entertained , " claims Tomorrow 's Producer Rudy Tellez . " But at 1 a.m. you have a different kind of audience , one that wants to be informed , that wants to know what 's happening . " Perhaps . Maybe some people simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At any rate , the first Tomorrow was spent discussing group marriages with two " triads " of spouses , one with two males , one with two females . Subsequent programs included a round table of rock groupies explaining their avocation , and a confrontation between a young woman involved with a Jesus people cult and a former social worker who " deprograms " such kids at the request of their parents . Upcoming shows will visit a nudist colony and entertain a delegation of homosexuals . " The network knows everything we 're going to do , " says Tellez , " and they 've given us carte blanche . " <P> Not quite . At a press preview of the premire ( all shows are taped in advance in Los Angeles without a studio audience ) , Host Tom Snyder opened with a scathingly opinionated monologue on the Agnew resignation . He castigated the " pious and sanctimonious bilge coming out of Washington " and concluded with the comment : " How dumb do they think we are ? " By the time the show went on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had forced Snyder to retape his opener , omitting his critical broadside . <P> Snyder , a radio and TV reporter since 1956 and currently anchor man for the evening news on Los Angeles ' local station KNBC , has a reputation for outspokenness . Says a network acquaintance : " Snyder will say anything . He 's brash , loud and unpredictable . " Snyder , 37 , claims that he is simply " a reporter interested in getting at the facts . " Nonetheless , on the first few shows , his questioning was occasionally so insistent that his guests hardly had a chance to answer . Snyder also frequently rambles on as if he were more fascinated with his own opinions than those of his guests . <P> Tall ( 6 ft. 4 in. ) , tendentious Snyder may not turn out to be every insomniac 's cup of warm milk . His perhaps too obvious intent is to be as unsettling as possible . But if the show 's guests are as offbeat as promised , Tomorrow may help tomorrow creep in at a slightly peppier pace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
