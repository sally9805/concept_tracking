txt A controversy over the future of Alaska 's vast wilderness aroused strong emotions this year in and out of Congress . It also led to the utterance of a good deal of nonsense . It did not , regrettably , result in the legislation that is badly needed to end two decades of uncertainty over the allocation of land to competing interests . Such a law would permit the people of Alaska to get full title to land that is rightly theirs and to get on with the job of tapping its wealth . At the same time it would permit Federal guardians to protect those areas in which considerations of scenery , wildlife and recreation outweigh economic values . The debate over how , fairly and wisely , to divide Alaska 's land became clouded in misrepresentation . Alaskan politicians depicted the proposed national lands law as a plot by environmental extremists to " lock up " the state 's mineral wealth in wilderness areas . But in fact , the state and the native Eskimos , Aleuts and Indians had already been given the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much larger than California . The rest of the state is unquestionably Federal land . The remaining issue is how parcels of that Federal land should be classified , a decision that will determine the degree of protection each parcel should be given . It is not surprising that the boomers , the advocates of maximum exploitation , would like to see most areas left open for mining claims , oil exploration , road building , hunting for sport , and the like . Large acreages should be open for such pursuits . But the American people are executors of a precious inheritance in Alaska , the largest undisturbed wilderness left on earth . The most valuable core areas , which Secretary of the Interior Andrus calls Alaska 's " crown jewels , " must not be spoiled . A balance must be struck . ? The House of Representatives did that last spring when it voted overwhelmingly to designate slightly more than 100 million acres as wildlife refuges , national forests and parks , and wild and scenic rivers . But a similar bill died in the Senate when Alaska @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The impasse posed the danger of a destructive land rush . A special interim protection for the best national lands provided by a 19711aw will lapse on Dec. 18 . Rather than let prospectors and state land selectors rush through an open legal gate , the Carter Administration pledged to protect the prime areas . Secretary Andrus has already acted , under an existing law , to withdraw 110 million acres from mining uses and selection by the state . An even firmer legal shield may be needed . President Carter can use his power to create national monuments to protect at least that acreage which would have become national parkland under the House bill . He should use it before the Dec. 18 deadline . Subsistence hunting and fishing could be protected and sport hunting permitted wherever possible . But even that action can be only a stopgap . Congress needs to move promptly next year to render unto Alaska what is Alaska 's and to protect those national lands that ought to remain forever wild .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
