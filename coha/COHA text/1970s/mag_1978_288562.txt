When Anwar Sadat signed the guest book at Camp David 's presidential house , Aspen Lodge , he was checking in at the world 's most exclusive and elaborate political retreat . A 30-min. helicopter ride from Washington , which is 75 miles to the southeast , Camp David is a 143-acre compound of more than a dozen buildings , perched on a 1,880-ft. hilltop in Maryland 's Catoctin Mountains . The heavily wooded setting , teeming with deer and raccoon , blue jays and snowbirds , and an occasional pileated woodpecker , provides Presidents a spot for total seclusion . Sadat 's visit last week marked the 20th time that a foreign chief has joined in that peace and quiet-Churchill 's five trips were the most numerous . <P> As befits such guests , Camp David boasts the kinds of services that could make King Solomon envious . Operated with military efficiency by about 100 Navy men and Marines , it can provide almost anything a President might want : a free-form heated swimming pool , a sauna , two clay tennis courts , a one-hole , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trout stream , skeet-shooting and archery range , movie facilities , a wide selection of music ( Richard Nixon used to stand in front of the stereo speakers and " guest conduct " his favorite symphonies fortissimo ) . Comments former Nixon Counsel John Dean : " It has a rustic feel but no rustic hardship . If Baked Alaska is what you want , Baked Alaska is what you get . " <P> Along with all the diversions , Camp David also provides-at the bottom of an elevator shaft sunk 100 ft. into the mountain-a fortress where the President could repair in time of war . Even in peaceful times , security is tight . Rifle-bearing Marines keep watch behind a double row of barbed-wire-topped fences . <P> Built in 1939 by the Civilian Conservation Corps and Works Progress Administration , the camp was originally called Hi-Catoctin . Franklin D. Roosevelt renamed it Shangri-La ( after the Himalayan paradise in James Hilton 's bestseller of that era ) when he chose it for his summer retreat . As F.D.R. 's son Elliott Roosevelt recalled , the camp at that time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rough pine cabins , but it suited Father down to the ground-metal bed , bathroom door that refused to shut tight , bare walls ornamented only with some of his favorite cartoons . " <P> Harry Truman hardly used the camp at all , preferring a Key West retreat . For President Eisenhower , though , the setting was so special that he renamed it in 1953 after his five-year-old grandson . <P> When Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev was first told that his 1959 itinerary included a stay at Camp David , he was mystified . In Khrushchev Remembers he said , " I could n't for the life of me find out what this Camp David was . I was afraid this was ... the sort of place where people who were mistrusted could be kept in quarantine . Finally we were informed that Camp David was what we would call a dacha . " His amiable talks with Ike on disarmament and the future of Berlin produced what was known as " the spirit of Camp David . "          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
