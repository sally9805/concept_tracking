The plot seemed like something out of Becket . The conspirator 's accomplice , a poor man , was to go to the city of Recife in northeastern Brazil and there seek out a certain troublesome archbishop . " That priest , " the accomplice was told , " must be eliminated . " As it happened , the 1968 scenario was never played out . The would-be assassin was too softhearted to go through with the murder . Instead , he went to his intended victim , confessed the plot and warned him that others might try . <P> A certain grace seems to touch the life of the diminutive ( 5 ft. 4 in . ) Archbishop of Olinda and Recife , Dom Helder Pessoa Camara . Better known to the world simply as " Dom Helder , " Brazil 's famed voice of the poor and preacher of nonviolent revolution is a persistent nettle in the breeches of his country 's military regime . At least eight of Dom Helder 's associates have been arrested and tortured . He has been castigated as a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Red bishop . " Lately he has been so judiciously ignored by Brazil 's censored press that some educated people in Rio are surprised to learn that he is still alive . <P> Outside Brazil , though , his name is very much alive-and widely honored . He has several times been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize and in 1973 received a " People 's Peace Prize " in Norway-$300,000 raised by European church and student groups , trade unions and political parties . Last week he was at Harvard University to accept an honorary degree as a doctor of laws . <P> Human World . It is on such trips abroad-three or four a year-that Dom Helder now pins many of his hopes , since in Brazil , he concedes , " we are crushed . " At times he has used his foreign platforms for stinging denunciations of terror and torture in Brazil ; more often he tries to prick the conscience of the First World for its complicity in the Third World 's troubles . He had prepared a biting acceptance speech-not knowing there would be no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he assailed , among other things , " the greed of multinational corporations " and " the injustices of international trade politics that keep two-thirds of humanity in misery . " Yet , characteristically , Dom Helder 's undelivered speech ended on an optimistic theme : his contention that there are courageous minorities everywhere who want to " construct a world that is more breathable , more just , more human . " <P> Dom Helder ( the dom is an old Portuguese title of respect ) was born 65 years ago in the northeastern Brazilian city of Fortaleza in the back room of a schoolhouse where his mother taught the primary grades . His father , an anticlerical journalist , chose the boy 's name from a dictionary rather than the calendar of saints but did not keep his son from studying for the priesthood . Ordained at 22 , Father Camara soon moved into religious education-and flirted briefly with the Brazilian version of fascism before moving to Rio in 1936.                    @
