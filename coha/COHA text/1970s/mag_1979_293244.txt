" Powerful self-control is the distinctive mark of John B. Connally , " says TIME Washington Bureau Chief Robert Ajemian . " He 's in control on the podium , where he ranks with Ted Kennedy as one of the two best stump speakers in America . He 's in control of his emotions , and he never appears off-balance . " A former assistant managing editor of LIFE , Ajemian has been covering presidential candidates since 1956 , and reported extensively on the Texan for TIME three years ago . For this week 's cover story , Ajemian shadowed three Connallys nonstop for a week : he rode with the leather-lunged campaigner on a four-states-in-four-days fund-raising sweep ; he weekended with the ten-gallon-hatted , boots-and-khaki cattle rancher at his Floresville , Texas , spread ; and he interviewed the smooth-talking , pinstriped attorney in his expensively furnished Houston law office . It was only in this third and most worldly incarnation that Ajemian saw Big John ease up on his relentless self-control and look touchingly human . " I had asked him about country-and-western music , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ajemian recalls . " Then , all of a sudden , he began to sing - his voice strong , a little creaky , perhaps and certainly less splendid than his oratory , but the words never faltered and he was into this song about The East Bound Train . " ( " My father is in prison/He 's lost his sight , they say/ I 'm going to seek his pardon/ This cold December day . " ) Ajemian 's reporting was woven into a cover story by Staff Writer Walter Isaacson , who got out from behind his desk in Manhattan to catch Connally in action at some Northeastern whistlestops . As a native son of Louisiana and former city hall reporter for the New Orleans States-Item , Isaacson is familiar with the eccentricities of Southern politicians . " Their style , " he says , " is a stimulating mix of the byzantine and the evangelical . " This week , after a year and a half as a Nation writer in New York , Isaacson begins a new assignment as a congressional correspondent in Washington , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dixie - not to mention the byzantine and the evangelical .
