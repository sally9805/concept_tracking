In agony and outrage over the murder of its athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics , the Israeli government organized a 15-man group of killers to liquidate the leadership of Black September . As Prime Minister Golda Meir bluntly announced : " We would do all we could to strike at the terrorist organizations and their bases wherever we could reach them . " In a series of chillingly executed missions , the counter-terror squad has since gunned down at least 13 Arab conspirators in such cities as Paris , Rome , London , Stockholm and Beirut . The team has also aborted , by its estimate , 37 plots against Israel . <P> But last week the assassins made their first known mistake : they killed the wrong man . For weeks the team had been tracking down the chief of European operations for Black September . They thought they would be led to him when they began following a Black September agent from southern Europe to Stockholm , then to Oslo and finally to a small Norwegian resort city , Lillehammer . There , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bouchiki , 30 , who looked like the Black September chief . Realizing his mistake , the agent stammered an apology and left . Bouchiki sensed that he had been checked out for some purpose and later told his in-laws that he was alarmed . <P> He had reason to be . The Israelis concluded that he was their quarry , though a brief investigation would have shown them that Bouchiki , who had come to Norway from Marseille six years before , was a waiter in a health sanatorium in Lillehammer . Two days after the encounter in the bath , the Israelis lay in wait for Bouchiki as he and his wife emerged from a movie theater . When the couple boarded a bus to go home , two agents in a rented car sent a message by walkie-talkie . As the Bouchikis got off the bus , a car approached . Out jumped a pair of men armed with silencer-equipped .22-cal. pistols . " No ! " shouted Bouchiki . Without uttering a word , each gunman fired six shots . The Arab died before an ambulance arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> The two killers escaped from Norway and arrived without mishap in Tel Aviv , though Norwegian police think they may have been responsible for the hit-and-run death of a 16-year-old boy . Two " trailers , " who had provided security for the killers , also made their getaway . But others were caught . Acting on tips , police picked up four of the Israeli conspirators at the Oslo airport ; they carried large sums of money as well as false passports . Two others were apprehended in the apartment of an Israeli embassy official in Oslo . <P> While officially denying any complicity in the Lillehammer assassination , the Israeli government was feverishly making plans behind the scenes . A legal adviser of the Israeli Foreign Ministry flew to Oslo as part of an attempt to gain release of the captured agents . Even though Norway has very friendly relations with Israel , it may be inclined to punish the agents severely in order to deter further terrorism . The murder was obviously an error , but that is small solace for Ahmed Bouchiki and other innocents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the Israelis and the Arabs .
