txt FEDERAL AGENTS were told by the city Friday they no longer can use taxicabs in Chicago to carry on surveillance unless they eet a court order . The restriction was termed " unfortunate " by United States Atty . Samuel K. Skinner , who said use of the cabs has been " beneficial to investigations , " particularly in narcotics violations and counterfeiting . The restrictions were announced by Jane M. Byrne , the city 's commissioner of consumer sales , weights , and measures , who under the 1976 city budget has been put in charge of licensing the 4,600 taxicabs operating in Chicago . " 1 ' 11 do everything to aid in law enforcement if the agencies get a court order , " Byrne said . " But to allow everyone and their brother to get into a cab and not know they 're being driven by the FBI is an unlawful invasion of privacy , Innocent bystanders could get into cabs and be spied on . " BYRNE SAID she learned only Friday that federal agents had been operating two taxicabs in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James Y. Carter , the city 's vehicle commissioner who formerly had charge of cab licensing . She said she will not issue the licenses without a court order because the vehicles are not being operated for transportation but for surveillance . She said her office must have a record of what licenses are issued and to whom and for what purpose . Byrne specifically named the FBI , an agency of the Justice Department , and the Secret Service , an agency of the Treasury Department , in her announcement . She said they had five chauffeur 's licenses and two cab medallions . Federal sources said , however , that the principal user of taxicabs for enforcement operations in Chicago is the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration . SKINNER SAID he was disappointed in Byrnes decision , and added : " She did n't contact me to discuss the impact of this action before she took it . . . So tar as I know , there has been no allegation of abuse by the federal agencies that might have led to her decision . It is unfortunate these restrictions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't know what could be done about it , however , because federal courts do not have jurisdiction to compel local officials to issue medallions . Richard Held , special agent in charge of the Chicago FBI office , said " taxicabs have been used for discreet surveillance necessary during investigation of criminal cases . " He said they are particularly valuable when following cars In city traffic , " to avoid detection of the surveillance . " As an example , another FBI spokesman said an undercover cab was used in 1959 when Virgil E. Gunlock , then CPA board chairman , was the target of a $50,000 demand from an extortionist . TIE SAID the extortionist was arrested after FBI agents followed Gunlock in a cab to the place where payment was to be made . The Treasury Department already has obtained a cab license for 1976 , Byrne said . She said she asked that the license be returned , but officials of the department insisted they were allowed to have them under a 1933 City Council resolution . She added that Corporation Counsel William Quinlan said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not yet obtained a 1976 license , she said , and none would be Issued without a court order . Asked if she believed the federal agencies were in violation of any city ordinances in obtaining the cab license , Byrne said : " There is no question of violating the law . These people are doing their jobs . But as a commissioner I have the responsibility to know who is getting lioenses and under what conditions , " SHE COMPARED the new requirement for a court order with procedures necessary to obtain search warrants and permission for wiretapping . Mrs. Byrne also said a freeze has been put on the issuance of new medallions for all cabs in the city until the vehicles are declared to be in a safe operating condition and all drivers are fingerprinted , photographed , given vision tests , and thoroughly screened . " There will be no automatic renewals of existing licenses , " she said . " Every applicant will be treated as new . "                 @ @ @ @
