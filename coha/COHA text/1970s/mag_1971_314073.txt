IN the long and fanciful lore of U.S. sports , the popular image of the star athlete has always resembled that of a Jack Armstrong modeled in granite-a little dense , perhaps , but still a selfless wonder who would do anything for " Pop . " the kindly old coach . The hero was humble , would blush when bussed by a cheerleader , and was forever uttering inspiring words like " When the going gets tough , the tough get going . " For him , a big night on the town was a twin bill at the Bijou and an extra-thick malted milk . He was the All-America boy . from his crew cut and three-button blue suit right down to his sweat socks and brown loafers . <P> Anyone foolish enough to talk that way about today 's athletes would be sued for defamation of character . The outspoken , power-conscious modern player no more accepts the daguerreotype than Muhammad Ali relates to Uncle Tom . In college and professional sports there are boycotts , strikes and lawsuits by players challenging the established order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no " I " in T. . . E. . . A. . . M , or that coach equates with king . The free safety is now a freethinker . The inarticulate tackle of old now has his own TV talk show . The rangy country boy with the deadly hook shot has a lawyer , a business manager and a press agent to handle his manifold interests . Nothing symbolizes the swinging new athlete better than his dress-both on the field and off it . <P> Freedom of Expression . The New York Jets ' Joe Namath was once instantly recognizable with his fancy white cleats , long hair and Fu Manchu mustache . But now Joe is being upstaged by a whole host of players with twinkle-toe shoes and pageboy locks . Defensive End Tommy Hart , who started a run on white cleats among the San Francisco 49ers , says gleefully : " We 're psychedelic , man ! " The Chicago Cubs ' Joe Pepitone , who favors lavender suede sashes and see-through paisley shirts off duty , gets his kicks on the field by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , beards , goatees and blossoming Afros are as common as jump shots . The Buffalo Braves ' Emmette Bryant has different colored sets of headbands-one for home , the other for away games . <P> Coaches may shudder at some of the lifestyles , but most take it in stride - though Cornerback Earsell Mackbee claims that he was cut from the Minnesota Vikings this season for showing up one day in a red lace jumpsuit , a fake fur maxi vest and a slouch hat . " Freedom to express your own personality makes for a winning team , " says the 49ers ' Ken Willard . " It 's the swinging feeling around the clubhouse . A feeling that they 're them and I 'm me . " His teammate Gene Washington , who grooves on $350 Oscar de la Renta suits , deplores the " archaic regimen " of traditional football-club rules . " Room checks at 11 p.m. on a Friday night before a Sunday game is Cub Scout stuff . I think professional players are above that . They will separate themselves from the team if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be judged by their own fellows . "
