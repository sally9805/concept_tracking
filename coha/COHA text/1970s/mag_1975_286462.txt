THE NIGHT CALLER Directed and Written by HENRI VERNEUIL <P> Much of The Night Caller concerns a Paris police search for a man who makes obscene telephone calls . This guy is not your garden-variety breather . He is a murderer who starts by ringing up women and ends by doing them in . As if this were not plot enough , the detective in charge of the investigation ( Jean-Paul Belmondo ) also devotes a great deal of time to tracking down a bank robber who has eluded him for months and become a personal nemesis . Belmondo 's pursuit , which is elaborate and unlikely , finds him at one point hugging the roof of a speeding Metro train as he tries to get at the bad guy trapped in the car below . It is a chase out of The French Connection or The Taking of Pelham One Two Three , so it is difficult to determine whether the scene is too shopworn to be effective or just too stupid . <P> The Night Caller is one of those French films made in envious and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Verneuil ( The Sicilian Clan ) works hard to duplicate every cliche of the genre , from a car chase right down to a breathless pursuit up stairs that wind like a snail 's shell . <P> Throughout the nitwit action , one notes what might be called a typically Gallic touch : even in the furthest extremities , Belmondo remains modishly tailored . This causes problems . Tapered trousers make it difficult to get a leg up , and boots with high heels cause any flatfoot to slip and slide on the fabled Paris roofs . It could be said that the only genuine suspense The Night Caller has to offer is whether the leading man will split his pants .
