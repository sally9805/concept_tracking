txt Meet the average , mayor now headed home from the five-day gathering of the U.S. Conference of Mayors just concluded here : He comes from a city of less than 100,000 ; is on fairly good terms with Washington ; and while he acknowledges and is concerned with his growing urban problems , he does not think that doom and gloom await him just around the corner . For while big-city mayors like Joseph Alioto of San Francisco , Kevin White of Boston , and Richard Daley. of Chicago may warn otherwise , Mr. or Mrs. Average Mayor does not really believe that " the seeds of New York are in every major city " ? at . least not in his or her city . And while the mayors unanimously express sympathy and support for their beleaguered colleague from New York , most believe , along with Birmingham 's George C. Seibels Jr. , that " my city is not decaying . " That said , however , the general thrust of this week 's conference has been to influence Washington to pay closer attention to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evident in major metropolitan areas ? and to provide more help in dealing with those problems .. Relations between Washington and the nation 's cities seem to have been bolstered by events here . President Ford declined an invitation to Boston , but invited 100 of the mayors to meet with him today in Washington . Secretary of Housing and . Urban Development ( HUD ) Carla A. Hills apparently . impressed many mayors whom she met in small groups . // *Small cities reject ' seeds ' of decay picture // Both Secretary Hills and Secretary of Transportation William Coleman told the city executives , however , not to expect massive amounts of additional federal money which , they warned , would create new inflationary pressures and add to the federal deficit . Big city mayors , as usual , dominated the public aspects of the meeting , calling for a retinkering of the federal revenue-sharing formula to channel more of Washington 's aid to major urban areas , and a " reordering of national priorities " with special criticism of President Ford 's defense budget . But key votes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a majority coalition of conservative , smaller-city , and Republican mayors . The national priorities resolution was weakened ( in the view of liberals ) with the deleting of the references to federal military spending which in past years had been unanimously adopted . To some mayors , this indicated a trend toward " more realistic ' activity on the part of the mayors ' organization . " Collectively , they 've got to get more in line with reality , and I think that trend is developing , " Republican Mayor Richaftl E. Carver of Peoria , Illinois , told the Monitor . A majority of the mayors also struck from the general-revenue-sharing resolution the call " to place greater emphasis on relative need . " This reflected both a fear on the part of some mayors that they would end up with less than the amounts they rely on to bolster their operating budgets and the feeling that attempts to change the formula of revenue-sharing. ( now up for congressional re-enactment ) would hinder extension of the law . While many mayors , particularly those from larger urban areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President to city needs , others were impressed with the message Secretary Hills brought from the Ford administration . " We have learned that any federal effort to recycle city resources must build upon locally conceived and directed plans , " Mrs. Hills said . This reliance on a " home town " approach , together with the HUD Secretary 's call for " a national commitment to the revitalization of the city " indicates to many mayors that President Ford is concerned with their problems .
