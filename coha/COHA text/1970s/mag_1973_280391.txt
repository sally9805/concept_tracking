" Everybody is always tugging at you . They 'd all like sort of a chunk of you . They kind of like to take pieces out of you . " <P> - Marilyn Monroe <P> " I fantasized it would be a simple matter for me-I was the one to take Marilyn away from Arthur Miller . Now I 'm older and wiser and I know better . I 'd have been no improvement on Miller . " <P> - Norman Mailer <P> He was three years old when she was born in 1926 . At the age of 25 , with Harvard , the war and a brilliant first novel behind him , he was an international celebrity . By then , with a history of foster homes , a wrecked marriage , a knockabout modeling career behind her , she was that classic Hollywood joke , a starlet-a person defined by Ben Hecht as any woman under 30 not actively employed in a brothel . But five years later , he was the one who was floundering , attacked as a writer whose promise had been tinsel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ global superstar . He was the one who fantasized about her . She did not know he existed . <P> It has taken Norman Mailer nearly five decades to achieve a truly Monrovian status . But he is still fantasizing . " I come from Brooklyn , " says Mailer , " and she had the basic stuff out of which Brooklyn dream girls are made . " Besides , " I felt some sort of existential similarities with Marilyn Monroe . " Both , in fact , were seen as romantic symbols , larger than lifestyle . Both were reconciliations of opposites : Mailer described himself as a radical conservative , a combination of street toughness and book learning . Monroe was the essence of soft , vacuous femininity-but she could be as bright and unyielding as a diamond , and she had deep yearnings for intellectuality . Both were disproportionately rewarded and resented . What could be more fortuitous than the meeting of these two uniquely American superstars ? The project belongs in lights : Gentleman Prefers Blonde : NM Meets MM . Out of such amalgams come great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Not that it matters . Mailer 's new Marilyn is a book of gargantuan propensities . It is giant in format ( 9 in. by 11 in. ) , formidable in price and weight ( $19.95 , 3 Ibs. 3 oz. ) , and incalculable in impact . It will soon be excerpted for publication in a dozen countries-including Finland , France and Japan . More than a million Ibs. of paper will be used for its first American printing ( in Monroe County , N.Y. ) of 285,000 copies . The Book-of-the-Month Club has made Marilyn its main selection for August-the most expensive book ever so offered to the membership . A TV special and screen bio are being planned . Doubtless there will also be Marilyn Monroe posters , buttons , dresses and hair styles . An industry is under way , triggered by this irresistible shotgun wedding of talents .
