Collectors of Americana also savor Braggadocio , Mo. , the Humptulips River in Washington , Hen Scratch , Fla. , Dead Irishman Gulch , S. Dak. , Cut ' N Shoot , Texas , Helpmejack Creek , Ark. , Bastard Peak , Wyo. , Goon Dip Mountain , Ark. , Tenstrike , Minn. , Laughing Pig , Wyo. , Two Teats , Calif. , or Aswaguscawadic , Me . <P> Not the least flavorsome was a sylvan place called Whorehouse Meadows , outside of Ontario , Ore . The meadow was named , with admirable directness , for some local women who once profitably entertained sheepherders there . But last week , the Oregon Geographic Names Board filed an official objection to a bit of bowdlerization by the Federal Bureau of Land Management . It discovered that the bureau , in drawing up a map of the area , had changed the name from Whorehouse Meadows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nearby spot , deftly retitling it Bullshirt Springs , a change so small that the natives see no reason to contest it .
