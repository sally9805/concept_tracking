It was arguably the toughest week in 40 years for U.S. corporations , their employees and their shareholders . The auto industry , reeling from the gathering disaster in new-car sales , was laying off workers by the tens of thousands ; at least 14 auto plants will be closed and more than 200,000 auto production workers , clerks and executives will be out of jobs during part or all of December . Oil companies grappled with new uncertainties about their future as the House Ways and Means Committee approved a tax bill that fairly soon is likely to wipe out the celebrated depletion allowance . Prospects for a quick end to the nationwide coal strike darkened as mine-union leaders raised new objections to a proposed contract that provides well over a 50% raise in wages and benefits over three years . On Wall Street , the Dow Jones average worried its way back down toward the 600 level , as signs of deepening recession mounted every day . <P> Zeroing In . Astoundingly , with confidence and capital markets quavering , the Government decided that this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It called for the breaking up of the American Telephone &; Telegraph Co. , the world 's largest business enterprise in assets ( $67 billion ) , employees ( 1,005,000 ) , . shareholders ( 2,930,000 ) and profits ( $2.99 billion last year ) .

Washington 's move came just as Bell had launched a massive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withdraw the offering until the capital markets could quiet down . Many investment analysts echoed Wall Street 's Joel Leff : " You do n't help by going out and attacking the widest-held and bluest-chip stock in the whole economy . You need to stimulate confidence in capitalism at this time , not stick pins in it . " <P> The Justice Department 's spare , 15-page complaint charged AT &T; with violating the Sherman Act by monopolizing much of U.S. telecommunications . The trustbusters ' main goal : to force A T &; T to sell off Western Electric , the wholly owned manufacturing subsidiary that plays a key role in A T &; T 's unique position in American business . <P> Under the Communications Act of 1934 , AT &T; operates as a regulated monopoly . Its 23 regional phone companies own more than 80% of the telephones in the U.S. , and it handles well over 90% of all long-distance traffic ; in return , AT &T; accepts regulation by the Federal Communications Commission and various state agencies , which set phone rates and thus control the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Western Electric is almost totally engaged in supplying about 90% of the equipment that the Bell System buys .
