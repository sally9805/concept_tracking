txt IT WORKED . Just like Roy Lindblad ? knew it would . But it did n't stop him from being nervous . From getting up at 3 a.m . Thursday morning to worry about it , or ' from ducking to the rear of the crowd when his invention was finally being displayed in front of the whirring television cameras , the flashing Kodaks and the dignitaries gathered along the Chicago River . But it worked . Just like Roy Lindblade wanted it to . And after the fanfare was all over , Lindblad ? relaxed and smiled . For it will save lives . That is why Lindblade , 51 , a quiet , painfully shy carpenter of 27 years , invented it in the first place . Not just to make himself rich . Not just to make himself famous . But to make up for a haunting , terrorized look he saw once on a fireman 's face . IIE SAW TIM face about two years ago when Lindblad ? was suffering from cancer . At one point , the doctors told his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Close-up With Anne Keegan But Lindblade made it and came home to try to recover . " I was watching the television after I came home from the hospital , " said Lindblade . " It was winter and they showed on the news a fireman crawling out on ice trying to rescue someone who had fallen through . " I happened to notice the fireman 's face ? the scared look on it ? and I put myself in his shoes . I thought , ' Man , that 's an awful risky way to try to save a life . Doyou have to risk losing a life to save one like that ? Ili this day and age , that should n't be . won't-feeling sa good myself but that face of  --  the fireman kept registering in my mind ' and I kept Waking ? and thinking and I started sketching my idea . I thought , ' Something could be built to stop people from drowning so easily , I just know it ' . " CALL IT YANKEE ingenuity . Call it common sense . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come up with the answer . Seven thousand people in this country drowned last year . Some fell through the Ice and no one could get out to them . Some drowned in little ponds where there was no one // ? .. 4111110 From page one Carpenter 's concern goes to the rescue Tribune Photo by cad Hum A demonstration of Roy Lindhlade 's lies-U-Uelt is conauctea I nursaay on the Chicago River by the Chicago Fire Department . // around who could swim . Some got battered in the embroiled waters below river dams and no rescue boat could make it out there . And many others died trying to save the ones who were drowning . " I started thinking about that and I started sketching an idea , " said Lindblade . " I told my two sons about it and they got pretty excited and started helping me . Then I got an artist to draw my invention , and I called the Chicago fire department and told them I had an idea . " THEY LET ME COME In and talk to them and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't encouraged me , I probably would have given up . " But we kept working on it ? this idea ? working on it on the Kankakee River and the Fox River and got out all the bugs . " We started with a ladder and some truck inner tubes . Then I went to Goodyear and they made me the inflatable air bags I needed . " I started off with a device to save people who 'd fallen through the ice and to make it easy for someone to rescue them . But this thing works on the water , too . " It wo n't sink or tip over . You do n't have to know how to swim to use it . It does n't endanger your life . And you can bring in as many as 20 people on it . " You know , when I first thought of this I called the Red Cross and the Coast Guard to find out if there was any such water rescue device . They told me all about water safety ? but there 'd been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . IT 'S LIKE NOBODY ever gave all those drowning people much of a thought . At least , nobody was thinking maybe there was a better way to try to save them than the old fashioned ways that do n't always work . " Roy Lindblade , though disabled and unable to work again because of cancer , dipped into his savings to build his first real workable model . Roy did the thinking and the planning . His sons , one a carpenter and the other a cabinet maker , quit their jobs to help him . They worked on the invention in a neighbor 's garage . And what they came up with is called Res-Q-Dek . Roy and his sons formed a company , with Roy 's wife as the secretary . It is called New Products Safety Corporation , with offices in Roy 's house . But by the beginning of the year , the Res-Q-Dek will start going into production and Roy already has 40 fire departments interested in buying . " YOU KNOW , YOU look at it and It seems so simple , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lives that have been lost and you wonder why it was n't invented before . But it was n't . " I do n't know . I was pretty sick there for a while . Maybe the guy upstairs spared my life then so I could figure this thing out and save some lives with it . " I ca n't work anymore . My boys will be taking over our little company . I want to stay in the background . " I guess the biggest thing for me will be when the first human life is saved . That 's worth more to me than all the fanfare like today and all those television cameras . " SURE , I WAS real proud today , but I 'm not real good at that sort of thing . If I got no publicity , that 'd be fine with me . But I told my sons , that I want to meet the first person my invention saves . " I do n't care when it happens or where it happens , I 'm going to go there and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's when I 'll know that it really works .
