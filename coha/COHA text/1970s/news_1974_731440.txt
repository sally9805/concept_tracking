txt If your state income tax refund is late , it may be the fault of Gov . Walker , or Atty . Gen William Scott , or state legislative leaders  --  or all of them . Robert Allphin , state revenue director , said today that about 100,000 refund checks are all set to go , but added : " We 're out of refund money . " The Revenue Department 's appropriation for the fiscal year beginning July 1 is hanging fire because of a ScottWalker feud which prevented adjournment.of the legislature last week . THE BILL authorizing Allphin 's department to disburse the refund checks is one of 22 bills now bottled up . Allphin said his department already has sent out about 2.5 million refund checks , but about 200,006 still must be distributed . The latest group of checks also has been delayed because of a switchover in the check writing process , he said . " We got behind early , " Allphin said . " We used to write the checks , but now the comptroller writes them . " Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involve address changes , he said . " They can not be processed easily thru our keypunch system , " he said . A f ter July 15 , another 100,000 refund checks will be issued in the department 's " mop up ' operation , he said . Those involve tax returns which require correction because of mistakes made in them .
