The peace-treaty negotiations begin <P> There was a slight sense of deja vu about the scene in the White House East Room last week . Just 26 days earlier , Jimmy Carter had sat there before the cameras and klieg lights , flanked by Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Premier Menachem Begin , to announce that the leaders were ready to sign two " framework " agreements that had been hammered out during 13 days of negotiations at Camp David . This time Carter 's companions were Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Dayan and Egypt 's newly appointed Defense Minister Kamal Hassan Ali . Their task : to work out the details of a formal peace treaty between Israel and Egypt , thereby ending a state of war that has existed between the two nations since 1948 . <P> The opening ceremony was short ( 15 minutes ) and to the point . Carter welcomed the visiting delegates , called on Jordan 's King Hussein and the Palestinians to join the peace process and emphasized that the current talks were merely the first step toward a comprehensive settlement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaking for exactly one minute , declared : " It is our hope and belief that we have reached the stage in which we can finally conclude a peace treaty . " In a 2-rninute reply , Ali restated the determination of his government to achieve an overall settlement and once again urged the other Arabs to join in . <P> Soon after that , the delegates walked across Pennsylvania Avenue to Blair House and sat down to business . Secretary of State Cyrus Vance served as chairman of the opening sessions . At week 's end he left for South Africa , turning over the gavel to Ambassador Alfred ( " Roy " ) Atherton , the President 's special emissary in the Middle East . The three partners quickly reached agreement on a mundane but vital procedural issue : instead of breaking up into working groups , each delegation in its entirety would participate in all bilateral or trilateral meetings . <P> Both the Israelis and Egyptians brought along draft treaties . TIME has learned that the U.S. also has a formal proposal-an eight-page document , spelling out in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas of discussion : 1 ) normalization of relations between Israel and Egypt , including the opening of borders , exchange of ambassadors , freedom of navigation through the Suez Canal , tourism and cultural and journalistic exchanges ; 2 ) a timetable for Israeli withdrawals from the Sinai , including the turnover of Israeli settlements and airfields in the Sinai to the Egyptians , and the establishment of demilitarized zones and specified areas for U.N . troops ; and 3 ) future economic relations between the two countries , including trade and possible joint ventures . <P> The delegates will also discuss the future of the American monitoring mission in the Sinai and the planned U.S. replacement of Israeli airfields in the Sinai with two new bases in Israel 's Negev Desert . One possible sticking point in the talks concerns Israeli oil installations in the Sinai . The Israelis may seek compensation for these installations ; at the very least , they will ask for a guarantee from Egypt to sell oil to Israel or a promise to set up a joint enterprise for exploring the Sinai oilfields . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
