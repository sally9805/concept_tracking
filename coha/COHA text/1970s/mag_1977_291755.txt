On moral matters , few politicians match the fervor of Cleveland 's three-term Republican mayor , Ralph J. Perk , 63 . Last month he had 70 city sanitation workers deliver questionnaires on pornography to 260,000 local households . Hizzoner 's avowed aim : to establish a community standard on obscenity , in line with the 1973 Supreme Court ruling on the need for local criteria for jury decisions in obscenity cases . <P> Last week , with Perk looking on and a miniskirted aide posting results on huge blackboards , 85 municipal workers tabulated responses from 13,000 questionnaires-a return of 5% . Results ? An overwhelming 11,625 said that persons engaged in child pornography should be charged with a felony . By 10,549 to 1,503 , Clevelanders also said that materials catering to homosexuals , sadists and the like should be banned . <P> Most professional pollsters , jurists and prosecutors in Cleveland dismiss Perk 's poll as far less than objective . Among other things , the mayor prefaced his questionnaire with a plea " to have evidence to present in court which will make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not so incidentally , plans to run for re-election in November .
