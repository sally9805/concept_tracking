! " As a youth , Hamilton was physically most attractive with red-gold hair , bright if somewhat watery blue eyes and a small but strong body . It was our peculiar tragedy  --  or glory  --  to be of an age and quality at a time and place certain to make rivals of us . Yet from the beginning we had a personal liking for one another . We were like brothers ( yes , Cain and Abel come to mind with the difference that each was part-Cain , part-Abel ) . At first meeting I knew Hamilton straight through . I suspect that he knew me as well , and could not endure the knowledge that of the two of us I alone had the means and talent to be what he most wanted to be , the president . He came to hate not only my capacity but my opportunity . Yet I wonder if he knew all along that I would fail , saw the flaw in me as I saw the one in him ? Speculation is idle now . Like brothers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I am not . Thwarted ambition never turned me sour as it did Hamilton , who at the end could not endure the American world I was helping to make and so , quite irrationally , made me out to be that hideous reality incarnate . Curious to think that we would almost certainly have been friends had we not been two young " heroes " at the beginning of a new nation , each aware that at the summit there is a place for only one . As it turned out , neither of us was to reach the highest place . I hurled Hamilton from the mountain-side , and myself fell . General Washington stood beside his desk as I entered . In response to my salute , he gave me his gravest stare . He was a master of solemnity . " Major Burr , you are welcome to stay here in the house until you find yourself a proper billet . " " Thank you , General , I am most sensible of the honour . . . " I was about to ask , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Washington began to speak , formally , somewhat hesitantly . Conversation was not easy for him with anyone . " We have heard excellent reports of you , Major Burr . From every source except Colonel Arnold . " " Colonel Arnold and I had but one disagreement . I thought it pointless to continue to send insulting messages to the British governor when we were in no position to do him the slightest damage . " " Why did we not take Quebec ? " " May I speak candidly ? " His answer came smoothly , from much practice . " I have always laid it down as a maxim to represent facts freely and impartially . " " We failed , General , because my plan was not followed . " I saw no reason not to go down firing . " Your plan , Sir ? " The small dull eyes in their vast sockets stared at me with wonder.  |p55I  told him in detail my strategy for scaling Cap Diamond . He was not impressed . " Wiser heads no doubt prevailed . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off . I was at General Montgomery 's side when he was killed . The other wise head now commands a depleted and broken force . " " You are most certain , Major , of your military gift . " " No , Sir . But it is a fact that the other strategy failed . I had hoped only to imitate the same tactic King Frederick set in motion during the siege of Dresden . " Young and opinionated , I hoped to impress my commander not only with my own military prowess but with my wide knowledge of modern warfare . Like so many young officers in those days , I had studied closely the campaigns of Frederick the Great . General Washington , however , did not read books ; he knew as little of Frederick as I did of tobacco farming , a business in which he had only recently failed . The wealth of his wife notwithstanding , Washington was in some financial difficulty when he took command of the army . He had not done well farming despite all sorts of theories about river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , and the invention of a plough ( shades of Jefferson ! ) which proved to be so heavy that two horses could not budge it even in moist earth . Although Washington was always short of money , he lived grandly . Later in the war , we were all startled and amused when his mother put it about that son George had robbed her of everything and so , being destitute , she was forced to apply to the Virginia Assembly for a pension . I am reasonably certain that Washington was innocent in this matter . He was , apparently , a dutiful son and the mother a source of much distress to him . When word came of her son 's " victory " at Trenton , the virago was quoted as saying , " Here is too much flattery . " It is plain she always disliked her son and he must , finally , have hated her . How odd not to like one 's own mother ! I always thought I would have adored mine , who saw it to die before we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A staff colonel entered . " Please instruct Major Burr in his duties . He will stay here , until billet-red in the town . " The General turned to me . " I shall want a full report of what happened at Quebec . " Interview ended , the General crossed to a long table covered with papers and began , at random I rather think , to read . From the back his heroic figure was only somewhat disfigured by a huge rump . Neither of us knew that even as we spoke , Montreal had been re-captured by the British , and our Canadian adventure was a failure . Longing firr military glory , I found myself seated at a desk for tenp56hours a day copying out letters from Washington to the Congress . Although defective in grammar and spelling , owing to a poor education , the General was uncommonly shrewd in the way he flattered congressmen . But then he had not spent fifteen years as a burgess in the Virginia Assembly without learning something of politics . Ultimately , I think , he must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warfare . History , as usual , has got it all backward . After ten days in which my most useful work was the examination of several bales of under-sized blankets from France , I was happy to receive from John Hancock an appointment as aide to General Israel Putnam . . . yes , I had gone over General Washington 's head to the president of Congress . I had no choice if I was to serve usefully in the war . In fact , as I pointed out to Hancock , I would rather be out of the army than clerk to a Virginia land-surveyor . There are of course many legends about my relations with Washington during those two weeks I spent at Richmond Hill . He is supposed to have been shocked by my licentiousness . I daresay he would have been had he known how I and a number of other young officers conducted ourselves on those rare occasions when we were free to visit New York City . But he knew nothing of such matters . It is true , however , that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hickey had been hanged for treason , to the delight of 20,000 New Yorkers . I was not present at the execution but I did read with amusement Washington 's statement to the troops . According to our commander , the English-born Hickey had gone over to the British not for money but because he was a life-long prey to lewd women ! It was a sermon worthy of my grandfather . Incidentally , the private soldiers disliked Washington as much as he disdained them . On the other hand , the young officers ( with at least one exception ) adored their commander , and it is the young officer not the private soldier who eventually decides what is history . I have never known New York so gay  --  despite the British fleet which materialised in the harbour June 29 . The Battery was regularly subjected to bombardments that did no damage . The girls , however , enjoyed squealing with excitement and rushing for protection to our strong arms . On July 3 , the British army under General Howe disembarked on Staten Island , a Tory stronghold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Washington . A confidence that was to evaporate when presently he contrived to lose both long Island and New York City . As I have already noted , Washington had had very little experience of/actual war before 1776 . Years before he had been involved in a few disastrous skirmishes with the French and their Indian allies on the Ohio . His first fame was the result of a despatch he sent to the Virginia governor in which he referred to the sound of the bullets that whistled past his head as " charming . " Strange word . Strange young man . In my view had Gates or Lee been placed in command of the army the war would have ended at least three years sooner . Each was brilliant . Each understood the enemy ( Lee , in fact , knew personally the British commanders ) . Each won true victories in the field against the British , something Washington was never able to do . But though Washington could not defeat the enemy in battle , he had a fine talent for defeating rival generals in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pinnacle , as he intended from the beginning . Washington did have a most unexpected penchant for espionage . Our intelligence was almost always better than that of the British . **25;0;TOOLONG judgement sometimes disallowed facts . For instance , despite every possible warning , he never believed that the British would attack New York Island when and where they did . Yet he must be given credit for tenacity . Although the war dragged on year after year due to his eerie incompetence , I suspect that the kind of victory he did achieve could only have been the work of a man who combined resolute courage with a total absence of imagination . I fear that I did not properly appreciate being an aide to Washington . I did not enjoy copying out letters asking Congress for money that was seldom forthcoming : the American soldier was as mercenary as any Hessian . No money , no battle . Nor did I much enjoy listening to the worshipful talk of the other aides who flattered Washington monstrously , to his obvious pleasure . I , on the other hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been advised by everyone that independence of mind was not a quality he demanded of subordinates . We were happy to be rid of one another . I was to have a better time of it with my good , old General Israel Putnam whose headquarters I joined in July 1776 at the corner of the Battery and the Broad Way . A former tavern-keeper , Putnam had the amiability of that class as well as a good if crude intelligence . His only fault was a tendency to repeat himself . Whenever the enemy drew close , he would invariably instruct the men not to shoot " till you see the whites of their eyes ! " l laving made the line famous at Bunker Hill , he tended to plagiarize himself , to the amusement of everyone except those officers who thought the firing ought to begin long before the whites became apparent to some of our myopic riflemen.  |p58On  July 9 , I took the salute at General Putnam 's side in the Bowling Green . Then at the request of the Continental Congress , our adjutant read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I confess to not having listened to a word of the Declaration of Independence . At the time I barely knew the name of the author of this sublime document . I do remember hearing someone comment that since Mr. Jefferson had seen fit to pledge so eloquently our lives to the cause of independence , he might at least join us in the army . But wise Tom preferred the safety of Virginia and the excitement of local politics to the discomforts and dangers of war . Living at Putnam 's house was a pretty girl of about thirteen whom I have been accused of having seduced . Margaret Moncrieffe was the daughter of a major with the British army ; she was also a cousin of General Montgomery ( how tangled our personal relationships were in those days ! ) . Since her father had been a friend of Putnam , the General took her in . If nothing else , the girl had spirit . I was present when she baited General Washington himself at Putnam 's table . As dinner ended , a toast was proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drank but Margaret . " You do not drink your wine . " Washington gave the child that cold dull serpent 's glance he usually reserved for those private soldiers who were about to be flogged on The Horse ( " Discipline is the soul of an army " was his favourite maxim ) . A disagreeable child , Margaret was not without courage . She raised her glass . " The toast is  --  the British Commander General Howe . " Washington 's face went red in blotches . " You mock us , Miss Moncrieffe . . . " Washington began and then stopped , unable as usual to organize a sentence that contained a new thought . The good Putnam came to everyone 's aid . " What a child says , General , should amuse not offend us . " Washington regained his usual serenity of expression . With an elephantine attempt at gallantry , he said , " Well , Miss , I will overlook your indiscretion on condition that you drink my health or General Putnam 's when you next dine with Sir William Howe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did not like the girl at all . Thought her precocious and sly . When I discovered that she spent hours on the roof with a telescope , looking across to the British encampment , I cautioned General Putnam but he took no notice . She then began a series of flower paintings to be sent as presents to her father . Watching the girl at work one day , I said , " I ) o you believe there is such a thing as a language of . flowers ? "  |p59Margaret  blushed prettily ( she was full-bosomed at thirteen ) and stammered . " Yes . I mean no . Not really . " Suddenly I was aware of a true alarm that had nothing of the flirtatious in it . Obviously the language of flowers could communicate troop positions . The girl was ' a spy . With some effort , I convinced General Putnam that she would be safer and happier farther removed from the potential line of battle ( I suspect the good general of having known the child best of all ) . Margaret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the British . Her subsequent life has been romantic and untidy . She lives now in London . For some years she was the paramour of the King 's minister Charles James Fox . I am told she gives to me the honour of having been the first to take her virginity . But I do not think that would have been possible . By the end of August 1776 , General Howe had assembled on Staten Island some 34,000 men . It was his intention to seize New York City , take command of the Hudson and split the colonies in two . May I say , what he intended to do , he proceeded easily to do . Immediately after the arrival of the British , I was sent by Putnam to every one of our outposts from the Brooklyn Heights to the Haarlem Heights . I had never seen men less prepared for a battle with anyone , much less with fresh modern European troops . Junior though I was to the great commanders , I took seriously my task which was to assess our situation as accurately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Putnam was sent on to the commanding general . Two days later I encountered His Excellency on the Battery . A sulphurous New York August day . Tempers were short . Sweat mixed with the chalk the General used to powder his hair trickled down cheeks fiery from heat and bad temper . His mood was not improved by the sight of the British fleet making complicated manoeuvres just opposite us , cannon beautifully polished , white sails pretty beneath a leaden sky . " What , Sir , do you think the result will be should the enemy begin an assault ? " I was taken by surprise : Washington seldom asked such questions of senior officers ; never of junior officers . " Why , Sir , we shall be routed , " I said with stupid honesty . " Never ! " The " never " was from a permanent member of the chorus of worshippers that was to follow Washington throughout the Revolution . . . nay , throughout his long life , even to the grave ! No man was ever so much praised and fortified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is my belief , Sir , that the wisest course would be the one you have so far pursued with such success since Cambridge . " Yes , I Was a courtier , too.  | " What , Sir , do you think that to be ? " Our suspicious war-lord suspected even then that I was not entirely in thrall to his legend which , quite mysteriously , continued to grow from month to month no matter whether he won or lost or , as was more usual , did nothing . " To imitate Fabius Cunctator . To avoid meeting head-on a superior enemy . To draw him away from his supplies . To draw him deeper and deeper into the continent where the advantage is ours not his . Sir , I would abandon New York City today . Give General Howe the sea-coast . He will take it anyway . But by withdrawing now , we keep intact the army , such as it is . . . " I had gone too far . One of the aides reprimanded me . " The best troops of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commanders . . . " " You under-estimate us , Major . " Washington was unexpectedly mild . With a lace handkerchief , he mopped his chalk-streaked face ; the pits from the small pox were particularly deep about the mouth . " You have asked for my report , Sir . " " Yes . " Washington turned his back to the port and gazed at the sooty old fort that used to dominate what was still a small Dutch town with rose brick houses and slender church-spires . But then John Jacob Astor was still a butcher boy in Waldorf , Germany . " We shall defend the city . " Washington 's mistakes were always proclaimed with the sort of finality that made one feel any criticism was to deface a tablet newly brought down from Sinai . " Sir , I would burn the city to the ground tomorrow and withdraw into Jersey . " " Thank you , Major . My compliments to General Putnam . Good day , Sir . " In defence of Washington , I must note that at the time very few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work upon him . There is evidence that he would have liked to destroy the city but was stopped by the local merchants ( to a man pro-British ) and by the Congress at Philadelphia which , eventually , ordered him under no circumstances to fire the city . Yet it was his decision  --  and no one else 's  --  to confront the enemy with all his forces at Brooklyn in Long Island . This was to be Washington 's first set battle ; it was very nearly the last . Even today 's hagiographers admit his sole responsibility for the disaster . Right off , Washington split into two parts an army which , entire , was not capable at that time of stopping a British brigade . Then he chose personally to respond to a dazzling series of British and I Icssian feints : in a matter of hours , he was out manned and out-generak  --  d . Thrown back to his main line of defence , the Brooklyn I lcights ,  |p61Washington  was faced with the loss of his entire army if he remained on Long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Heights and withdraw to New York Island . He chose humiliation . On the unseasonably cold and foggy night of August 29 , I stood in a water-melon patch near the slip of the Brooklyn ferry and watched the evacuation of the army . All night boats went back and forth between New York and Brooklyn . Low dark shapes appearing and disappearing into a strange soft fog . The only sounds the soft moans of the wounded , the whispered commands of officers , the jangle of General Washington 's bridle as he presided over the debacle he had devised for us . On September 15 , 1776 , the British fleet appeared at Kip 's Bay about four miles north of the Battery . As usual , we were surprised . A powerful bombardment began at t t : oo A.M. Then the British and Hessians disembarked . Our troops promptly fled , despite the presence of Washingtonhimself who shrieked at his own men like a man demented , broke his stick over a brigadier 's head , cut a sergeant with his sword  --  to no avail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sound of British bugles mocking him with the fox-hunter 's " View , halloo ! Fox on the run ! " Washington retreated up the island to the Morris mansion on the Haarlem Heights ( now the home of Colonel and Mrs. Aaron Burr ci devant Jumel ) which was to be his headquarters for the rest of September . This must have been the lowest point of his career ; worse , in some ways , than the winter at Valley Forge . I sit now in what was his office , as I amend these notes , and think of him more than a half-century ago , scribbling those long , ungrammatical , disingenuous letters to the Congress , trying to explain how he managed at such cost to lose Long Island and New York City . During this period I saw General Washington only once at the Morris mansion . It was September 22 , and I had accompanied General Putnam to a meeting of the senior officers . There was a good deal to talk about . The previous night almost a third of New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done us a good turn . " Washington stood at the foot of the stairs with his plump favourite young Colonel Knox . Before General Putnam could say anything , Washington turned to me and I received for the first and only time his bleak dark-toothed smile . " I would not , Sir , have put it past you to have done this thing . " " Only at your order , Your Excellency . " General Putnam and Colonel Knox had no idea what we were talking about.  |p62CHARLIE  , I SHALL BURROW into my trunks and find you more of these notes  --  assuming that you are not too much ennuied by such old matters . The other night as I wooed Madame on those very same stairs , I thought of Washington . For an instant I could see him , just next to Madame , with his dark smile , and the inevitable sprinkle of hair-powder on the shoulders of his buff and blue uniform . Oh , there are ghosts among us ! But then what are memories but shadows of objects gone to dust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt preserved not only in my vivid if failing memory but actually on display somewhere , in the grisly form of a set of false teeth stained black with Madeira . THE STORM BURSTS ! Neither the Colonel nor Nelson Chase has been inthe office for more than a week . Mr. Craft and I do the work as best we can . Among my recent duties was the reception yesterday of the Colonel 's partners in the Texas scheme . As I suspected there was a flaw in the land leases ; and the Germans are not coming . The Colonel has lost his entire investment . The partners are irritable . I put them off . " TheColonel is out of town . " What else can I say ? Late this afternoon the great yellow coach , ominous as the chariot of the sun , came to a halt beneath my window . The coachman shouted up at me . " Madame expects you at the City Hotel . " The coach departed  --  without me . I am to walk . At the foot of the horse-shoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Both looked as if they had been weeping . Superficially , rage and sorrow are much alike . Madame seized my arm , as though without it she would sink to the floor . " He has sold my second carriage and the gray horses , too ! " " He has vanished . " Nelson Chase sniflid uncontrollably . Neither tears nor rage , as it turned out , but the hay fewer . Madame steered us into the I . adics I ) ining Rcxnu where she ordered teap63which she promptly enhanced with rum from a silver flask , adorned with Napoleonic bees . " It is unbelievable ! Incroyable , Chariot ! " The rum began slightly to mellow her . " On Monday he tells me he must go to Albany . He will travel by the boat . I say no '  --  like a fool  --  ' take the second carriage . ' So he departs , waving his hat from the window ! Ma foil I could kill him ! For a week I hear nothing until . . . Rum and tea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through which Nelson wheezed the remainder of the story . " Madame saw her own carriage this morning at the Bowling Green . She thought the Colonel must have just returned . She asked the coachman  --  a stranger-and he told her that his master , a Jennings of Newburgh , had bought the carriage a few days ago from Colonel Burr for five hundred dollars . " " It was worth a thousand ! " This carne out clear . " Where is he ? " Chase looked at me as though I must know ; must tell . " He said he was going to Albany . " This was true . " But I do n't know . " Also true . " He is not in Jersey City . " Chase looked at me significantly . " Oh , we know about Jersey City ! " Madame put a jewelled finger alongside her nose the way Italian singers do at the opera ; and then she winked with a lewdness that would have shocked Mrs. Townsend as much as it did me . " II y a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Jane McManus . " Nelson Chase was swollen and grim . " At his age , imagine ! " " His age has nothing to do with it ! " Madame 's wrath , never for long settled in any one direction , was hurled like Greek fire at Nelson Chase . " I only meant . . . " " The Colonel is a man above all else ! A creature of fire ! A perfect balance between Apollo and Mars . Fidelity is for these wretches ! " Madame grandly indicated the room of New York ladies and their swains , many of whom kept looking our way with obvious fascination . " I would not want a husband who was so lacking in puissance ! Let him keep his girls in Jersey City , he is hardly old . . . " I could not believe my ears . The Colonel is seventy-seven . That he is still active is miraculous ; that Madame should condone such activity is beyond anything that I know of the world . " It is not the girls I mind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To sell my new coach and horses for half of what they are worth ! I Ic will ruin me ! "  | " He has already lost the money you gave him from the sale of the Connecticut shares . " For reasons of his own Nelson Chase is now undoing the marriage he helped bring about . " He is incorrigible ! He has spent a hundred fortunes in his time . Well , he wo n't spend mine ! Tell him that . Tell him if he does not pay me the thousand dollars he owes me for the carriage and horses , I shall divorce him . " " We have sufficient evidence . " Nelson Chase was happy . I assured them that whenever I saw the Colonel again I would tell him what Madame had said . Then I escorted them to the stairs that lead down to the internal carriage way . Face rosy with rum , Madame was now in a good mood . " Tell him , Chariot , I wait for him eagerly . " " With the one thousand dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart ! " Lurching slightly , Madame made her descent , Nelson Chase at her side . I went back to the main hall , passing the dining-room which was almost filled . For a moment I put my head inside the spacious , comfortable room that always smells so wonderfully of vinegar and roast meat . Sometimes the Colonel eats here , alone , in a corner . But not today . I felt a tug at my jacket . I looked down and saw the ancient Dr. Bogart . He had recognised me through his veils of cataract . " My boy ! Sit down ! I always eat at this hour . Sunrise and sundown . So should you . " I sat next to him as he ate  --  gummed  --  boiled potatoes . " I 've not seen our friend the Colonel since the great day . " Dr. Bogart chuckled horribly . " Everything as happy as can be ? " " Oh , yes , Sir . " " A pretty couple . But then it 's the least that girl could do for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " What good turn did he do her ? " But Dr. Bogart was on a different tangent . " The other wedding was different , let me tell you . " I did not actually let him tell me but of course he did . " A very plain woman , the first Mrs. Burr . Poor Theodosia . Ten years older than Aaron she was , with this terrible scar on her forehead . And sickly from the cancer even then . And five children by her first husband . And not a penny to her name . But Aaron adored her . So did we all . My people lived nearby in Paramus . " " Where did he meet her ? " Since I was to Ix  --  told , I preferred an orderly presentation . " ' I he war . " I ) r . Bogart looked vague ; mashed a potato with his slxxn ;  |p65gradually  retrieved the past .

I remember all this because , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes looked at mine ; eyes that had seen not only battle but the young Burr who was " the handsomest boy you ever laid eyes on . Slender and wiry . Hard as a hickory limb . And , oh , the mind ! The mind ! In those days there was hardly a girl who was not a little in love with Aaron Burr . " It was lucky for them , I thought , that he returned their interest so fully . " Theodosia Prevost she was . She lived at the Hermitage . Across the way from Bogart Farm . Her husband was a British colonel , serving in the West Indies . By rights she should 've been moved out as a Tory but since she was born American , since she was a friend to George Washington and to Jemmy Madison , she was allowed to stay on , and all our officers used to visit her . Even Washington came to call one day . Then the young Colonel Burr  --  the youngest in our army he was  --  started his night raids against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That is , those of us left who can still remember the night raids and our young days . . . " Dr. Bogart lost his train of thought . Stared vacantly at his plate . " Colonel Burr , " I prompted him . " Theodosia Prevost . " Dr. Bogart was recalled from whatever limbo it is that draws the ageing mind . " Her husband died , the war ended , and she married the Colonel at Paramus . What days those were ! " And at some length Dr. Bogart spoke of a period in which skies were bluer , water purer , potatoes better-grained than now . I know the speech . It is the tirade of the old . I asked about Burr 's exploits in the Revolution . " He knew what he wanted from the day he joined General Washington at Cambridge . Illegally , I might say , because he was not of age . His guardian was furious  --  you know , Aaron was orphaned from the age of two . So the guardian , an Edwards , sent him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home on the ground that he was not only a minor but , according to the family 's doctor , of too weak a physical disposition to survive any war . " Dr. Bogart 's thin blue lips made a thin blue smile : he too has outlived many a doctor . " Well , Aaron told the messenger that if he tried to take him from the camp , he would have him hanged . And so the man gave him a second letter from the guardian  --  who knew his ward , you might sav  --  and that letter was milder , and there was a bit of money in it , too . So Aaron went to war , and was one of our first heroes . After Quebec everyone knew his name . " Dr. Bogart was about to tell me more when William de la Touche Clancey sat down next to me with an insolent crash ( do I resemble a country youth because I am small ? ) , and I made a quick farewell to Dr. Bogart . Clancey gave me a hard look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This afternoon I had the inner office to myself . Like a thief I tried for the second time to open the trunk beneath the baize-covered table . I succeeded . The Colonel had only half-turned the key and the tongue of the lock was not secure in its place . The contents were pretty much what I expected . Packets of letters . Newspaper cuttings . Toys for the grandson who died shortly after the Colonel 's return from Europe in 181 2 . I note that he refers to the boy and himself , interchangeably , as " Gamp . " I looked in vain for any reference to Van Buren . But then it would take a month to study all the letters and papers not to mention the thousand-page journal the Colonel wrote while he was in Europe , to be presented to his daughter Theodosia on his return . Presentation was never made , of course . After the death of her child , Theodosia set sail for New York . The ship was lost at sea and so the journal rests in the trunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sake , I wonder if it ought to be read . With startling candour the Colonel reports his poverty in London andParis ; his attempts to get an interview with Napoleon , to borrow money , to obtain a passport from an American consul who detests him and will not grant him what is any citizen 's due . I was most struck by the way in which the Colonel describes each of his sexual encounters , using French words which I do n't always understand as well as a private language shared by him and his daughter . SAMPLE PAGES for May 2 , 1811 , at Paris . I FORGOT TO TELL YOU last evening again the vigils until the watchman called two o'clock . The tea at dinner was too strong and I too weak not to drink . Took my leisure in bed , and did not go out until three , after eating potatoes . Boiled . Went to the Tuileries to look at beautiful women , and saw only one in a carriage . line duchesse au mains .

The arcades of the Palais Royal a-twitter with fines . A wide range like the Battery on a similar day in spring . But unlike the Battery a small price will gain you the world , and no talk of marriage . Much attracted by a dark creature , the image of Beau Ned Livingston 's Creole wife , with a mole at the corner of her full mouth . " Bonjour , Mademoiselle . " I was most courtly . Gave a deep bow . She gave me a majestic stare . I practised French . She practised mathematics . In a matter of minutes we were en route to her atelier , a single room on the fourth floor of a ricketty building back of the Palais Royal and from the sounds and sights ( and smells ! ) much frequented by the fines and their amis .

Her brother is a clerk in the foreign ministry ( she says ) . I take Vanderlyn 's advice based on the latest medical theory ( departement de Venise ) and after the splendeurs de l'amour appropriate the vase de nuit and take a hearty piss . WHAT SORT OF MAN iS the Colonel ? What sort of daughter was Theodosia ? When I read his letters to her , and hers to him , it is like an exchange between Lord Chesterfield and his son ( had the son been the father 's equal , for Theodosia 's style is learned and brilliant ) , but then when I read this journal and realize the way they spoke privately to one another I am mystified . I wonder what will happen to the journal . I suppose Mr. Davis will destroy it . He ought to , if he wants to make a case for the Colonel . Colonel BURR WAS in the office when I arrived this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have seen Madame . And know all ! " He rubbed his hands together mischievously . " We are estranged . But only temporarily . For the next few days I shall be stopping with a youngp68protege in the Bowery . A rising silversmith , if silversmiths can be said , properly , to rise . " " That would be Mr. Aaron Columbus Burr . " I was pleased at my own boldness . But then the Colonel 's manner is contagious . I was rewarded with the first surprised look I have ever managed to extort from that old knowing face . Pale eyebrows arched until they touched the rims of the spectacles which , as usual , rested just below the becombed topknot . " Charlie , you interest me . You do . " He paused , wondering no doubt just how to express his interest . " You have not been following me about , have you ? Like Nelson Chase ? " " No , Sir . It was a guess . Someone mentioned that you had a son who was a silversmith . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His mother saw to that by giving him my name , with the thoughtful addition of Columbus ' in the hope that the child might one day imitate the original and discover not only his father but our new world  --  which he did when he was eighteen . Now he wants to bring his mother to New York . " The Colonel sighed . " When I first met her she was the assistant to a watch-maker in the Rue Royale . She was superb with machinery . She could fix anything from a clock to a compass . I have not the slightest desire ever to see her again . I try to dissuade Columbus from importing Maman . ' " Burr sliced the end from a seegar . " I told him that his house is much too small as it is for himself and his wife  --  a charming creature from Staatsburgh  --  and their two bright children not to mention myself from time to time , their old Gamp . " As he lit the seegar , he looked positively tender : children , I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women . " You will meet Columbus , by and by . He is a handsome lad , who speaks English with a very bad accent . I have never had much time to give him , poor boy . " Smoke wreathed the Colonel 's head like a halo slightly askew . He changed the subject . " Our friend Nelson Chase arranged a bit of sport for me in Jersey City . That 's why I am now removed to the Bowery . " " He is working for Madame . " I declared my allegiance , such as it is . The Colonel nodded . " As you know , I often visit a dear girl named Jane McManus . I find her company soothing  --  as I found her grandmother'ssome fifty years ago . She was also from Jersey City  --  obviously a place for me of enduring magic . Anyway we were surprised , Miss Jane and I , by her maid , a goggle-eyed creature in the pay of Nelson Chase . Ip69got the whole story from the girl , with the help of a cane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me in a compromised state so that she might be able to testify as a witness should Madame choose one day to dissolve the sacred bonds that exist between her and me . Well , catch us the girl did . Miss Jane is still weeping at the shame of it all . And Madame now possesses her shoddy evidence . " " I think , Sir , Madame 's objections are not to your . . . your . . . " " Friendships ? " There was an ironic glint in those youthful eyes . For once everyone is right : Aaron Burr has made an agreement with the devil . Every dark legend is true . " It 's the money that upsets her . The money you 've lost on the Texas land grants . " The Colonel frowned . Whatever his arrangement with the devil , competence in money matters was not a part of the contract . Matthew Davis once told me that , right after the Revolution , the Colonel acquired the largest fortune of any lawyer in the history of New York City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I admit I ought not to have sold our carriage without first telling her . That showed want of feeling . But the offer was such a good one . The money so necessary . And Jake the coachman  --  a capital fellow , by the way  --  said the grays were not much good . Anyway , it 's done . " A sudden gust of wind caused the scarlet-leafed vine outside the window to rap three times upon the dusty glass like knuckles on a coffin lid . Why does that image occur to me ? Burr is eternal . Yet , inadvertently , eternal or not , he shuddered at the sound . " We must be on our guard , Charlie . " " Yes , Sir . Do they know where you are living ? " " Not yet . Let us keep them guessing a while longer . I am involved in a new scheme which . . . " The Colonel stopped . He is always discreet about divulging prematurely what he is up to . This may explain his disasters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You must see the new play at the Park Theatre . I went last night with Columbus . A melodrama but not entirely stupid . We sat in a box which cost us seventy-five cents apiece . Such extravagance ! " Then the Colonel indicated several old books on the table . " I bought these for you , Charlie . Second hand , I fear . Gibbon 's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire . Take them . Read them . Become civilised . " Mr. Craft hurried in with work for the senior partner . The moment of intimacy was at an end.  |p70AT  EXACTLY six o'clock , I knocked on the front door of 3 Bridge Street . I was even more nervous than I thought I would be when Leggett told me that he had made the appointment . A large woman opened the door . Without asking my name , she simply said , " He 's in the front parlour . " And vanished , into the back of the house where 1 could hear women laughing . There was also a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a foot-race . For a bachelor the great man was hardly lonely in his New York residence . Standing at the fireplace , beneath a drawing of a Moorish-looking palace ( the Alhambra ? ) , was Washington Irving . In the books I read at school he is portrayed as a dreamy-looking , slender youth . No longer . He is now very stout and elderly , with a crooked but pleasing smile . The eyes are guarded , watchful ; and he does take you in , every inch , the way painters do at the preliminary sketch . He affects to be shy . At first the voice was so low that I got only an occasional word . " So happy . . . Mr. Leggett . . . to Washington City soon . . . not used to . . . please . . . sit down . . . too warm ? " Mr. Irving sat us down face to face in the two wing chairs before the fire , our knees almost touching . A sharp wind made draughts in the room . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schuyler ? " " No Schuyler . " Invited to give my familiar demur , I lost some of my nervousness . I explained to him that my father had kept a tavern in Greenwich Village and was in no way connected with the glorious Schuylers . " I am partial to the Dutch . " Irving overcame his disappointment , finding what solace he would in the unmistakable physical fact of my Dutchness . With yellow hair and blue eyes , I look like every caricature ever drawn of a Dutch lout . I take after my late mother , a Schermerhorn ; no , not the rich Schermerhorns , the others . Irving tried speaking to me in Dutch and was disappointed when I did not understand . " The old talk is being forgotten . We 're all of us the same now . Early this month I was at Kinderhook with . . . " The pause was marvellous . The whole world knows that he was visiting Vice-President Van Buren. " . . . with an old friend , of the Dutch stock . And we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know when we were young . The Dutch are like everyone else now . I u colour goes . " Irving'sp71habitual tone seems to be melancholy , and his sentences tend to terminate in the dying fall . " Is the Van Buren tavern still at Kinderhook ? " I moved too swiftly . " Yes , yes . Do you know it ? " Polite interest , nothing more. " 1 have heard so much about it from Colonel Burr . I am in his lawoffice . " " Aaron Burr . " Irving said the name softly and with some feeling . But precisely what emotion I could not determine . Certainly there is no hostility . Perhaps wonder . Regret . " Yes , Mr. Leggett said you were interested in Colonel Burr 's career . My brother once edited a newspaper for Colonel Burr , a long time ago . " The eyes shut . " Morning Chronicle it was called . Most political , my brother Peter was  --  and is . A dedicated Burrite . Colonel Burr was the vice-president when I first published my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his paper . Over thirty years ago . I told him that when I was in school I read his Jonathan Oldstyle letters . Apparently even then people were looking back to the " good days " of old New York . As much as I admire Irving 's work , I do not share his delight in Dutch quaintness . I like nothing about being Dutch , including all the jokes about us . " It is curious that one of the last of the little pieces I wrote for the paper was an attack upon the practice of duelling . That was just two years before . . . " Irving gestured . Eyes evaded mine ; settled on the Moorish castle above the fireplace . From upstairs came a terrible shriek . Irving gave a start ; looked alarmed ; sighed . " Children , " he said , and for a moment lost his usual sweetness of manner . He is plainly not used to family life . But then he has been living a bachelor 's life for the last twenty years in Spain and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like an Englishman  --  of the polite kind  --  than an American . He could step on the stage of the Park Theatre to-night and play with the greatest of ease man-servant to a duke . " You must have seen Colonel Burr at Richmond Hill ? " Irving smiled . " Oh , yes . But I was not one of The Little Band . That was what the Colonel 's admirers called themselves . A most devoted group , and with good reason . Colonel Burr was New York 's Maecenas. 1 le loved artists . Liked to help them . No good artist who asked him for money was ever disappointed . Both he and Theodosia . . . " Mrs. Burr ? " " No , she was dead by then . 1 mean Theodosia his daughter . The most extraordinary woman I ever met . " Irving seemed genuinely moved ; thep72round eyes glazed over . " She was small , dark and splendid , with the Grecian profile . She spoke a half-dozen languages . Knew every science . Read Voltaire . Corresponded with Jeremy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " From all accounts Theodosia was indeed a paragon but for mysterious reasons of his own I have the impression that Irving exaggerates his passion for the long-dead beauty , expressing his adoration in complex complete sentences as a single tear rolls slowly down his cheek into the fortress of that tall starched stock there to splash in darkness from chin to chin like . . . . I am beginning to parody his style . " Was Mr. Van Buren often at Richmond Hill ? " A silk handkerchief was used to remove the saline track the tear had made on the smooth plump cheek ( I can not forget that this is the man who wrote the favourite stories of my childhood ) . " I think not . " Irving was cautious . " Their friendship has been made too much of . " " But did n't Colonel Burr stay with Mr. Van Buren at Albany when he came back from Europe . . . " " Mr. Van Buren was once a friend . Therefore he will always be  --  amiable . But there is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is often mentioned as a possible secretary of state in a Van Buren cabinet . After all , he is an experienced diplomat who was for some time charge d'affaires at the American legation in London . In fact , he was there last year when Van Buren arrived as minister , appointed by President Jackson and then , humiliatingly , rejected by the Senate as a result of Vice-President Calhoun 's malice . The subtle Irving , however , was most kind to the discredited ambassador and managed for him to be received by the King and made much of by London society . Irving is also supposed to have told Van Buren that his rejection by the Senate would be the making of him . " For , " Irving is reported to have said , " there is such a thing in politics as killing a man too dead . You will now be Jackson 's next vice-president , and that will be the end of Calhoun . " The unworldly Irving proved to be as good a political prophet as he was a friend . No wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moon about Dutch ruins . Rip Van Winkle has indeed waked up and returned to us , with a future president in tow . " I am not so certain that I can be of any use to you , Mr. Schuyler . " I was aware now of the diplomat on guard . " I do agree that a study of Colonel Burr 's career would be fascinating to read . But do n't you think it is  --  perhaps  --  too soon ? So many people still alive . " Like Mr. Van Buren ? "  | " It is also said that President Jackson was even more deeply involved with Colonel Burr . " There was a definite sharp edge to the melodious voice . " So was Senator Clay who  --  " We were interrupted by a powerfully built blond youth . " Mr. Irving ! Oh , I am sorry . You are not alone . " The boy hesitated in the doorway . I got to my feet . " This is John Schell , Mr. Schuyler . " The boy 's handclasp was bone-crushing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London . He is staying here while he gets the feel of our new country . " " Excuse me , Sirs . " The German accent was heavy . The boy bowed stiffly and left us . Irving continued : " I was about to say that when I saw Senator Clay at the Park Theatre last night  --  " " Last night ? But Colonel Burr was there , too . " " I know . " Irving smiled . " Did he tell you what happened ? " I shook my head . " Henry Clay came in at about nine o'clock . Almost everyone stood . And cheered . A most tumultuous welcome . " A delicate crooked smile . " I somehow kept my seat during this Whiggish display . Then , at the interval , as I was crossing the foyer , what do I see but Colonel Burr suddenly  --  by accident , I should think  --  face to face with Mr. Clay . The one lean and mad-eyed with that awful mouth like a carp , the other like some dark imp from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Mr. Clay reeled  --  there is no other word for the backward falling movement he made . Then well-wishers bore him away . I do n't suppose a dozen people standing there recognised Colonel Burr and of those who did hardly one was aware how , years ago , Clay , a very ambitious young lawyer in Kentucky , successfully defended Aaron Burr against a charge of treason  --  and very nearly nipped his own political career in the bud . Oh , your Aaron Burr is the sprightly skeleton in many a celebrated closet ! " " Including the President 's ? " " I think  --  do n't you ?  --  that their involvement was explained at the time in a most satisfactory way by General Jackson . " The response was stiff , to say the least . But then Irving 's friend cannotbe our next president unless the current president chooses to promote him ; therefore Andrew Jackson must be above suspicion . They all must . Yet there are those who believe that the whole lot were once involved in treason , Burr , Jackson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington Irving is willing to betray none.  |p74A  clatter from the kitchen beneath reminded us that the family supper was almost ready . I rose . " You never see Colonel Burr ? " Heavily , Irving got to his feet . Our knees for an instant struck . " I saw him last night . But we do not speak . What would be the point ? Of course he was once most admirable . But I do think  --  all in all  --  that he does himself  --  all of us  --  a disservice by . . . " The tentative crooked smile again , the voice suddenly , deliberately soft . " . . . well , by living so very , very long  --  so unnaturally long  --  a continuous reminder of things best forgotten . " " I think it splendid that he is still among us . Able to tell us the way things really were . " " Really were ' ? Perhaps . Yet is n't it better that we make our own useful version of our history and put away  --  in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less edifying details ? " Irving walked me to the front door , now blockaded by a child 's hobby-horse . Together we lifted it out of the way . " My compliments to Mr. Leggett . If you see him , say that I shall meet him Wednesday for our weekly tete-d-tete at the Washington Hotel . You must join us . " The hand resting on my shoulder gave a sudden pinch , like a corpse 's fingers going into rigor . " I am sorry to be so little help to you . " The hand and arm dropped to his side . " I do have the notes I made during the treason trial at Richmond . If you like , I shall have a copy made for you . " THIS MORNING Mr. Craft and I worked on briefs . Colonel Burrmeditated in his office . Creditors came and went  --  obviously distressedthat the Colonel is again without money : everyone in the city still thinks that he is the master of the Jumel fortune . As usual , in his case , the truth is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I le is a gray lean bespectacled man with a secret smile ; very much the political mover and shaker ; also , very much the newspaper editor --  -- he has almost never been without a partisanp75newspaper to edit . Mr. Davis went into the smoke-filled lair and shut the door behind him . An hour later , Colonel Burr called for me . The two ancient conspirators sat facing each other over the open trunk . " Charlie , do give Mr. Davis my notes on the Revolution . " " Have you copied them out ? " Mr. Davis has the confiding Tammany voice . " Yes , Sir . " I turned to Colonel Burr . " I hope you do n't mind my copying them ? " " No . Not at all . Look to it , Matt ! You have a competitor ! And what a task ! For both of you . The rehabilitation of a man who has been slandered by both Jefferson and Hamilton . A considerable honour , come to think of it . They never agreed on anything save that I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merrily . I can not think why . " If it 's true that slander has slain more than the sword , then for all practical purpose I am long  --  and doubly  --  dead . But it may yet be possible for you two fine fellows to put it about that no matter how dark my villainies I was at least a good soldier . " The Colonel was unusually elegiac . " Hamilton was a poor soldier . . . " But the Colonel cut Mr. Davis short . " No , Matt . General Hamilton was always a man of courage  --  at least when there was an audience . " The conversation then turned to the affairs of Tammany , which interest me not at all . Mr. Davis was pleased about the immigrants who almost daily arrive in large numbers from Europe . He expects to enroll them in Tammany , and win elections . Burr was not enthusiastic . " They will win elections all right , but not for you . " Mr. Davis did not understand . The Colonel explained . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get white in the face at the thought of the wicked church of Rome , or like Jefferson who was mortally afraid of Jesuits , but I promise you , Matt , when these Catholics outnumber the old stock two to one . . . " " How can they outnumber us when we 'll be making good Americans of them ? " Burr 's laugh was like an organ 's bass note . " Whatever a good American is he can not be a Roman Catholic at the same time . It is a contradiction . And when there are two of them for our every one , they will divide up the property . You 'll see . And why should n't they ? That is true democracy and they  --  not we  --  will be Demos . " Burr turned to me . " You will live long enough , Charlie , to see an elected judiciary . " Mr. Craft 's clerk entered with a letter . " Anonymous , Colonel . Thep76author prays that you burn in Hell , Sir . Mr. Craft thought you would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threw the document into the smouldering grate . Then Mr. Davis left and Colonel Burr sent me on an errand to the Register 's Office . Later I was to meet him at the City Hotel . As I was crossing Wall Street , I saw my father coming out of the Post Office . He was well dressed and not drunk , though not sober either . " Charlie . " He gave me a vague look . " It is you , Charlie ? " " Yes , it is . " We had not met since he killed my mother three years ago . " You are still in Colonel Burr 's office . " " You are still at the tavern . " Two statements , requiring no answer . " I 've been buying stamps , you know . " My father indicated the Post Office as though it would corroborate his story . " I must go meet Colonel Burr . " " He must be right old , the Colonel . " " He is . " " I always voted for the Colonel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the eye . Since we had nothing further to say to one another , we parted . The Colonel greeted me gaily at the corner of Wall Street and Broadway . I told him of my encounter . He knows I am estranged from my father ; does not know why . " Charming gentleman , your father . Kept the finest tavern in Greenwich Village . Such a pleasant place . " Colonel Burr took my arrn . Together we crossed Broadway , avoiding a crowd outside the City Hotel . " Mr. Clay must be stopping here , " said the Colonel . " No . He 's at the American Hotel . " Colonel Burr gave me a side-long look . " You have heard of last night 's encounter ? " " Someone mentioned it , yes . " " There are only two men on this earth who fear me . One is president and the other would like to be . " " And both were with you at the time of the . . . " I have yet to find the proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ west . Jefferson called it treason . Chief Justice Marshall and a jury suspected a misdemeanour . " A most curious man , Henry Clay .. " T h e Colonel suddenly stopped ; stumbled ; brown face gone tallowy . " I'here 's sonRthing wrong with my leg . " I Ie looked bewildered . " There 's no keling in it . " I lcp77staggered . " I ca n't walk . " He started to fall . I caught him . Propped him against the wall of the hotel . " I 'll get a carriage . " Burr nodded , eyes shut  --  leaning , no , collapsing against the wall . In Reade Street , Mr. Craft helped me carry him upstairs to a small room with a cot where the Colonel sometimes rests . A doctor was sent for . Once on the cot , Aaron Burr took a deep breath and fainted dead away . I HAVE JUST COME . BACK from two days at the mansion . All is forgiven . Madame is in her element . " My brave warrior ! Light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at last ! " Madame stands at the head of the Napoleonic sofa on which Colonel Burr is stretched out beside a roaring fire . He wears a quilted robe . The face is as smooth and keen as a boy 's . To the doctor 's bewilderment ( but not mine ) , he is making a fine recovery from the stroke . The left leg is still partly paralyzed but he can now hobble about unaided  --  on the rare occasions when Madame lets him . She spends all day and night with him , assisted by the niece . The traitor Nelson Chase is not in evidence . I spent two nights in the mansion . Having lived in boarding-houses since I was sixteen and went to Columbia , I found it a remarkable experience to be waited upon by eight servants , with a fire in my bedroom all day and night . I now see why everyone in New York is so eager to be rich . Madame regales us with anecdotes of her career . At one point , she sends for the cook . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Norah knows exactly what to tell , and does so . " You see , I was in the kitchen one noon while Madame was away from the house , and I was fixing for us in the house some boiled pork and cabbage . . . " " The best in the world ! " Madame drinks to pork and cabbage while Mary Fliza does needlepoint beside nie on a sofa and the Colonel reclines languorously , and smiles benignly ; the satyr lips unwithered by time.  |p78.  . when in comes this nice foreign gentleman , small and dark he was with an accent like one of the waiters at the French taverns in the Bowery . So he says Is Madame here ' and I says No ' and he says can he look about the house and I says he can and he looks about for a while and then he comes down to my kitchen and says kind of sad-like I have to go all the way back to Jersey now ' and 1 says Well , have a little something to eat ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I sit him down at the table . . . " " And there I found them ! Dining a deux . Norah et son majeste le Roi de l'Espagne . " I look blank . Madame promptly translates for me . Apparently it was Joseph Bonaparte , Napoleon 's brother who was king of Spain and now lives in New Jersey . Madame Jumel waves Norah back to the depths . " Le Roi has all the Bonaparte force . " More anecdotes . My head begins to ache . " I was in Paris , " said the Colonel , " for two years and never  --  but once  --  did a Frenchman ask me into his house . " " How odd ! In Paris I paid calls daily and received callers . " A point for Madame . " How could they have deprived themselves , my dear Eliza ? " Burr shut his eyes . " But then I was remarkably poor . I used to eat two pounds of grapes a day because they were cheap . " " Exile ! What this country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and so am I. On the table beside my bed , I find a packet with a note in Colonel Burr 's handwriting . " For C.S. Although our merry caper in the Broad Way has had  --  to date ( just before dinner )  --  a happy ending  --  or continuing  --  why am I using so many dashes ? Like a schoolgirl . The dash is the sign of a poor style . Jefferson used to hurl them like javelins across the page . Yes . I ramble . Yet I think my mind is unaffected by the seizure , and the leg improves with every hour . Nevertheless , it is possible that I might , rather suddenly , die . So I give you now the rest of my notes on the Revolution . They are not complete . " When I was in the Senate , I was briefly given free access to all official documents pertaining to the Revolution . With a clerk to copy documents , I used to work from 5:00 A.M. until i o:oo A.M. at the State Department . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the spurious ground that a U.S. senator ought not to have access to the correspondence of existing ministers , ' the whole archive was denied nie . Later what I had managed to collect in the way of documentation was lost with my daughter at sea.  | " Sometimes I have written only a paragraph , intending more . Other times , I reconstruct from memory . 1 doubt if I shall ever add to what I have done . Perhaps you can make something of these fragments . Matt Davis knows that you have them and should I be translated to a higher sphere you are to make them available to him . That is a sacred trust , Charlie , much the worst kind ! " A look at the " fragments . " Some long . Some short . A kaleidoscope of those days . I start to copy them out . General KnoxOF ALL THE MEN attached to Washington , Henry Knox was the most truly adhesive . Fat , slow-moving , crafty , an excellent man for the organizing of a headquarters , he lacked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our chief of artillery from 1776 to the war 's finish he was never entirely certain which end of the cannon you lit . Yet he was a marvel at finding artillery whether cast by us at Litchfield from church-bells or from the remains of the Bowling Green statue of George III or simply stolen in the night from the British . Knox had been a bookseller in Boston . He was one of the few men familiar with books ( or at least their bindings ) that Washington was at ease with . He served loyally in the first Cabinet . I saw Knox in action  --  if that is the phrase  --  September 15 , t 776 , the day the Continental Army enjoyed its resounding defeat at Kip 's Bay and fled ( or as Washington put it " withdrew " ) to the village of Haarlem . With two junior officers I was caught in the melee . Thinking to find Washington at Richmond Hill , I rode in that direction . Communication had entirely broken down , and if there were new orders none knew them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself . Half-way across the island we came to a makeshift fort of hastily prepared earthworks behind which cowered an entire brigade . I assumed that they had not known or understood the original order to retreat to 1 Iaarlem . " Who commands ? " I shouted to the first sentinel . " Colonel Knox ! " was the answer . Then himself looked above the dirt like a fat mole just flushed from ground . I introduced myself . Asked why the brigade had not moved out . " Not possible , Major . The British have split the island . But we shall do our huts . We shall hold this flirt to the end . " The young voice trembled  |p80The  staff officers eyed us nervously . No one wants to hold a fort to the end ; particularly a non-fort . " Sir , " I was respectful but urgent , " you can not defend these earthworksagainst one howitzer . " " We are dug in , Major . " For an instant it occurred to me that Knox might not want to move his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I turned to a captain . " Have you water ? Provisions ? " " No , Sir . We are only just dug in . " " Then , Colonel , I propose you obey His Excellency 's orders and withdraw to Haarlem . " " We can not ! " The usually brazen loud voice was a squeak . " The British are already between us and Haarlem . " " Sir , they are not . " Knox 's officers had now joined us in that pleasant autumnal glade where yellow leaves diffui ed bright sunlight . A cool breeze rattled branches overhead ; and carried to my nostrils that unmistakable odour men exude when frightened : no one wants to be killed . And death was now at hand . " My intelligence tells me that since three o'clock this afternoon the British are drawn in a line straight across New York Island , a half-mile to the northeast of us . Listen . You can hear them firing . " Knox did his best to look martial in the presence of his own unimpressed staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nothing more . " Sir , " I said , " I can not tell whose muskets those are but I propose you move out of here as quickly as possible . " " Sir , I command here . " The round face swelled like a bullfrog 's at mating time . I turned to the officers . " Gentlemen , if you stay here you will be slaughtered by the enemy . You are outnumbered and out-gunned . Worse , those who are not killed will be taken prisoner and hung as high as Master Hickey . " I was inventing freely but in a good cause . The officers began to talk all at once . Knox was drowned out . A vote was taken . The brigade chose to move on to Haarlem . " We can not move ! " Knox was furious . " We do n't know the island . We 're from Massachusetts . " " I know every path and trail from the Bowery to the Heights . " Which was true : as a boy I had often hunted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Knox protesting , the brigade assembled and we marched straight into a nest of British infantry who , seeing is like so many wild beasts bursting upon them from the yellow wood , ran as fast as they could , without firing a shot.  |p81For  two miles I rode at the head of the brigade . Knox did not speak to me once as I led the men through thick woods and across those deep swamps and sudden streams that are a characteristic of what is now called , so affectedly , Manhattan Island . At only one point were we fired on . Knox was terrified . But before he could give the wrong order , I cantered in the direction of the firing , two officers beside me . On a rocky ledge we found a small company of British infantrymen . With wild Indian yells , we rode straight at them , as if we were the advance guard of a vast horde . They fled into the forest . We chased them for half a mile , killing several . The sun was almost gone when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had vanished . I was terrified that Knox had surrendered to the first passing British officer , but luckily he was only lost . We found the brigade marching serenely to the west . Knox was bewildered when 1 pointed out to him that a trail that led toward the setting sun could not help but bring him eventually to the city of New York , and the British gallows . The day was dying when we saw before us the single church spire of Haarlem Village , surrounded by the lights of the American camp . The men cheered . Colonel Knox said not a word to anyone as he led his brigade into the camp . Although my exploit was presently known to Washington , no official mention of it was ever made . Three months later ( December i 776 ) Colonel Knox became chief of artillery and a brigadier-general . Night-ridersIN JULY 1777 , I was at Peekskill with General Putnam when my commission as lieutenant-colonel arrived from General Washington . I thought it overdue . I said as much in a letter to His Excellency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Island now took precedence . Those things mattered greatly to me then because they mattered to everyone else . We were hungry for honour in those days . Washington 's response was elevated and aside from the point . But then I was already known to be friendly with those commanders he disliked , particularly the brilliant if unstable General Charles Lee , late of the Polish army . It was a law of General Washington that the mediocrities who worshipped him like Knox should rise inexorably during the war , while the Lees , as inexorably , sank.  |p82I  was to be second-in-command of a regiment stationed on the Ramapo River in Orange County , New Jersey . The regiment was the creation of a wealthy and genial New York merchant named Malcolm . This gentleman desired nothing more than to be revered as the father of his regiment , preferably at a comfortable distance from any administrative or military duties . We got on famously . He moved twenty miles away from our encampment , rented a large house and there lived happily ( and paternally ) ever after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I found the men lax because their officers were New York gentlemen , more interested in parties than drilling . I was strict but seldom resorted to The Horse . This meant constant vigilance . I was always on the move . Slept in my clothes ; when I slept at all . Got the reputation for having a pair of eyes in the back of my head . All this at age twenty-one . It was glorious ! During this time George Washington was conducting the war in his own mysterious way . After losing the battle for Long Island , he was surprised at Kip 's Bay and so lost New York City to the British . He then sustained a defeat at White Plains after which most of the Continental Army went home . With what men remained , Washington scurried across the North River . Yet if in August of ' 76 Washington had abandoned to the British everything east of the Hudson River , he would have been able to keep intact his army , dig in before Philadelphia , and hold that city . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Island and City , demonstrating to everyone that he had neither the resources nor the craft to defeat the British . The Revolution was nearly over and done with by the winter of 1777 . A number of young officers prayed for Washington to be relieved of command . Some of us wanted Lee . Others Gates . No one but the sycophants on His Excellency 's staff wanted another winter of Washingtonand failure . Had the British realized the extent of our confusion and weakness , they might then and there have forced a peace upon us for with each passing day Washington 's conduct of the war was creating Tories by the thousands , including a number of powerful if secret ones in the Congress itself . My task in September 1777 was to make the enemy regret that they were not Americans . I think we succeeded . Certainly they were never able to adapt to our Indian-style fighting which relied on darkness , stealth , surprise . We knew the wild forests around Paramus . They did not . We never met them in battle . Rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them down one by one , prcfi r : hly in the dark.  |p83Our  night-rides became famous through all that part of New Jersey , and at least one young commander thought this a delightful way of living . But then I had met at the Hermitage , a fine house just beyond Paramus , the lady who would one day become my wife . It was a peculiar joy to creep like an Indian through dark pine woods , past enemy pickets , in order to join a brilliant party at the Hermitage and then , at an alert from a posted servant , to leap out a back window and vanish like a shadow when the moon is gone . Winter 1777-1778 . Valley ForgeTHOSE " BLOODY FOOTPRINTS IN THE SNOW " at Valley Forge ! I have neverenjoyed anything so much as the memoirs of James Wilkinson , author of this pretty image . But then Jamie could not tell the truth even if it were convenient to do so . There were ragged men and broken shoes at Valley Forge but I recollect no blood upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought us to that windy Pennsylvania hill-side , and the bleakest hours of the war . In September 1 777 the British out-manoeuvred Washington once again and occupied Philadelphia ( the Congress now became a burden to the city of Baltimore ) . Contrary to accepted legend , the Philadelphians did not at all mind the presence of the British army in their city ; in fact , many of them hoped that Washington would soon be caught and hanged , putting an end to those disruptions and discomforts which had been set in motion by the ambitions of a number of greedy and vain lawyers shrewdly able to use as cover for their private designs Jefferson 's high-minded platitudes and cloudy political theorizings . Shortly before Christmas 1777 , I reported to General Washington at Valley Forge , some forty miles from Bethlehem in Pennsylvania . The commander 's quarters were , as always , comfortable ( in February the Lady Washington would arrive to preside over the court ) . I waited alone in a cold ante-room . Aides came and went , including General Knox who bestowed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognised Colonel Hamilton who was pleased to see me , as well as an old friend and contemporary , Colonel Troup , who told me , " You 're to be a diversion . Go on in . His Excellency is in a rage . " I entered what must have been the dining-room of the original house . Washington stood in front of a fire , facing two gentlemen in civilian clothes . He responded to my salute without ceasing to attend the burghers.  | " You gentlemen will recognise , no doubt , Colonel Burr who was at Quebec with General Montgomery . " My name was indeed known to these two members of the Pennsylvania Assembly who were also suppliers to the army  --  which is to say thieves . One was large ; the other small . Their names are respectable now in the history of Pennsylvania and so I will not embarrass their descendants , who doubtless venerate as noble patriots the heavy-set villain and his slight accomplice . The large one said , as though in explanation , " You will admit , Excellency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He waved his arms to north and south . " Plentiful water , a mill , timber from which you can build cabins . I have a consignment of nails , just arrived , at your disposal . . . " " I trust the Pennsylvania Assembly has already paid for the nails . " One could hardly blame Washington for his bad temper ; he had wanted to go into winter quarters at Wilmington in Delaware , but Pennsylvania 's delegates to the Congress threatened to withdraw all financial support for Congress as well as for the army if he did not remain in Pennsylvania . So in order to make money for a pack of merchants , our half-starved army was now perched on the side of a wind-swept hill and those few who were not sick were now expected to build a camp , and survive somehow without provisions until the spring . The small one got the subject away from nails . " We have all manner of supplies at hand . Or nearly at hand . Certainly you will lack for nothing a grateful colony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There was a sudden loud noise of cawing . The small man stopped talking . Even Washington allowed his dull face to relax into bewilderment . The cawing grew louder . A thousand crows , two thousand crows were sounding in the winter stillness . " Caw , caw , caw ! " Colonel Troup entered . " It 's the men , Your Excellency . " " Caw , Caw , Caw ! " " They want food , Your Excellency . " Washington turned to the Pennsylvanians . " There are only twentyfivebarrels of flour in the camp . Presently the men will mutiny . If you do not supply us by tomorrow , there will be no one to protect you from the British hangman . Nor will there be anyone , gentlemen , to protect you from me . " Colonel Troup showed the shaken Pennsylvanians out . Washington proceeded to deal with me . " I have heard of your night-raids in Jersey . They have been appreciated . " " Thank you , Your Excellency . " I wondered if ' I should drop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the ceremony ' of Washington 's courtp85became more royal . " I had hoped I might be of the same service now . " " In Pennsylvania ? " Washington waved a large ink-stained hand toward the window . " No , Sir . Staten Island . I know every inch of it , and I know we can do serious damage to the British there . Particularly with night-raids . " " How many men would you need ? " " Two hundred , Sir . From my own regiment . " " You mean from Colonel Malcolm 's regiment . " This was flat . We were fated to dislike one another . On my side I found irritating the slowness of his mind ; not to mention his awesome gift for failure in the field . In three years he had lost every engagement with the enemy except for a small victory at Trenton and that had been an accident : the Hessians had not posted guards the night of his attack . At this point in the war the only American victories were those of Gates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many officers wanted Washington replaced . They had my sympathy . Caw ! Caw ! Caw ! As Washington invented reasons for keeping me at winter quarters with nothing to do , the crowing continued and I saw that he was much shaken by it . Finally he dismissed me with " You will employ Colonel Malcolm 's men in the building of wooden cabins . " Thus was I domesticated . Outside headquarters , I found Colonel Hamilton . He was staring down the side of the hill to the first of the tattered tents where a number of patriots were crowing and flapping their arms . A comical sight when described on the page but downright sinister to observe in what was supposed to be an army . Interspersed with the cawing was the cry " No meat , no meat ! " " We must do something , Burr . " This was one of the few occasions that I ever knew Hamilton not to begin a conversation with a charming salutation . " Yes . " I was agreeable . " We must find food for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You do n't know these Pennsylvanians . " He shook his handsome head ; a thin little fellow with patched breeches like the rest of us . " I would go to the nearest town and take what I needed . " I Iamilron gave inc a contemptuous look . " If we did , every last one of those business men ' would take the oath to the King . " I was not impressed . " Then we can hang them . " I enjoyed shocking I laniilton , or rather allowing him to play at shock . Actually , he was far more devoted to demonstrations of force ma%errre than 1 . Mischievously , Ip86asked him if he enjoyed the position I had found unendurable on Washington 's staff . Hamilton was oblique . " I find my place discouraging . Between the fools in the Congress and the treachery of certain of our general officers . . . " He launched into a scathing attack on Gates . " A vile intriguer , constantly writing to Congress behind His Excellency 's back , conspiring with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time I learned of the so-called Conway Cabal which was , at that very moment , aiming to replace Washington with Gates . Although Hamilton was no admirer of Washington , he had elected to rise through him and so was not a part of the cabal whose leader was a newly-arrived French officer named Conway . An intelligent but impetuousman , Conway had somehow persuaded Congress to make him inspector-general of the army . This was a blow at Washington . Fortunately for His Excellency , it was also a blow at every senior officer in the army and their bitterness at Conway 's undeserved promotion enabled Washington to play on the common jealousy , thus isolating Conway . But the Frenchman was resourceful . A series of letters between him and Gates convinced the latter ( as if he needed convincing ) that he alone could defeat the British . What an extraordinary winter it was ! Within the log cabins of our starving , half-clothed army there flourished intrigues of a complexity unknown at the court of the Sultan , as hundreds of letters in cipher passed back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centre of all this activity was  --  who else ?  --  James Wilkinson . I saw Jamie Christmas day as he passed in splendour before my hut . In October he had been sent by Gates to Congress with the news of our army 's first and only true victory of the war , the surrender of the British general Burgoyne and his army in the north . With the good news was a request from Gates that the bearer be promoted to brigadier-general . By this peculiar criterion , if the news had been bad , Jamie would have been broken to major . Without demur or reflection , the jubilant Congress complied . The promotion of Conway had been bad enough but Wilkinson 's absurd elevation caused some twenty colonels to write in protest to Congress . I was not one of them : Jamie was still my friend . I was still his " idol . " We embraced in the snow . The beardless youth was now a man who looked older than his twenty years  --  a fortunate thing considering Gates 's folly in placing him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his billet . Ile told me of the retreat from Canada ( he had joined Arnold a week after I had left ) . I told him of the retreat from I.ong Island.  |p87We  made our way carefully among tree stumps , boulders , iced-over puddles . Everywhere the noise of axes ; cursing of men . Some 1,1 oo cabins were going up amid a thousand small fires . So many bursts of hot orange against cold gray , resinous smoke that made eyes sting and water . Most veterans tend to recall their youth as one of perpetual highbloomingsummer . Perhaps it was for them , but for me it was always winter . Even now I suffer at bone-remembered cold , want more fire , more heat ; recall with a shudder that steep bitter Pennsylvania hill-side where half-starved men huddled close to their fires , some wearing only blankets because Congress 's money for us had been stolen by so-called suppliers . We felt abandoned . We were abandoned . Elsewhere , let it be noted , the nation 's founders spent a comfortable winter , particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was able amongst his books to gather his ever-so-fine wool . Jamie had found for himself a small out-building , well chinked with clay . A fire was going on the hearth . Two junior officers ( in age at least five years our senior ! ) saluted and departed . We sat before the fire , each scratching furiously as one always did when those of lesser or greater rank were absent . With the possible exception of General Washington and his Lady , we were all of us lousy at Valley Forge . " Burr , you are the greatest fool ever ! " This was said lovingly . " You could have been the brigadier by now if you had stayed with Washington . " Jamie offered me fire cake ( a mess of flour and water baked on a hot stone ) . I ate hungrily . " I have not a clerk 's mentality . " " So make yourself other duties . You do n't see Troup or Hamilton copying letters . " " I prefer having my own regiment . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the way Jamie had matured ; in appearance , that is . In character he was the same odd mixture of impetuous youth and shrewd intriguer , to use General Washington 's favourite word at Valley Forge . I have often reflected how curious it was t hat James Wilkinson , a born politician , should rise to the very peak of the A nierican army and I , a born soldier , to the peak of American politics . I ach lived the life the other should have led . Soldier Burr was then swiftly brought by Politician Wilkinson into the heart of a complex intrigue . " Gates must take over the army . There 's no one else . " I was stunned . I had assumed that Wilkinson was with Washington and against the cabal.  | " A majority in Congress will support us . " Jamie filled his chest with air . " But for the moment no one dares bring down the Demigod . " " They never will . " I was sufficiently versed in Revolutionary matters to know that as bad a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an even larger statue of George III in the Bowling Green . At this point in our affairs Congress was faced with a true dilemma . It was now plain to everyone that Washington was not  --  and would never be  --  sufficiently competent to defeat the British . Either Gates or Lee was preferable . But neither Gates nor Lee nor anyone else had the authority to keep together what army we had while holding in check the pack of thieves and rhetoricians that called itself the Congress . I HAVE LOOKED through the rest of Colonel Burr 's notes but I find nothing more to do with Wilkinson or the Conway Cabal . The next note describes Washington 's assignment of Burr to a mutinous regiment at Valley Forge . The Affair at the Gulf " GENERAL MCDOUGALL ASSURES ME that you are an excellent disciplinarian , Colonel Burr . So I give you command of this most troublesome regiment . " Washington was seated after dinner before the fire . Opposite him sat the Lady Washington , her small pleasant sly face looking out at us from under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the girls of Litchfield when I was studying law . She had a disquieting tendency to nod or shake her head for no particular reason , as though affirming or denying some inner voice . Several members of the General 's military family were also seated about the room , going through despatches , pretending to work . Only Hamilton simply read a book ; his passion for reading was as great as my own . Like me he usually read history or philosophy . In private , however ( if I may be allowed to traduce his memory and expose him to all the world ) , Hamilton was a devoted reader of women 's novels , as I discovered one day at the New York Society Library when I came upon a note in his hand asking the librarian to reserve for him Edward Mortimer ( by a I , ady ) and The Amours of Count Palviano and Eleanora . I was shocked . It was not until middle age that I allowed my own education occasionally top89lapse and took to reading novels and foolish plays  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be as much at my ease as was possible with the Demigod . " The regiment is stationed at the Gulf . " This was the pass through which the British would come , if they ever did . " They lack discipline . They do not keep proper sentinels . Worse , they are prone to false and mischievous alarms . " Mrs. Washington nodded her head fiercely as though the more false alarms the better . " I shall do my best , Your Excellency . " This was the most one ever needed to say to General Washington . In ten days I took a disorderly and incompetent militia ( formerly commanded by a brigadier ) and through vigorous drilling day and night deliberately inspired a number of them to attempt mutiny . On the morning of the tenth day I learned that certain of the men had sworn an oath to kill me at the next assembly . During the day I took precautions . Then at midnight I ordered everyone out . A cold night . A bright moon . The rattle of drums . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looking each soldier in the face . Half-way down the line a man leapt forward , pointed his arm at me and shouted , " Now is your time ! " Several muskets were raised and trained upon me . " Fire ! " he shouted . A flat sound of clicking : the bullets had been removed . I drew my sword and swung it as hard as I could at the arm still out-stretched before me . There was a thick snapping sound as metal cut through bone . He screamed . White clouds of frozen breath hid his face . Nearly severed , the arm fell to his side like a broken doll 's . " Take your place in line , Sir . " He obeyed , and I dismissed the company . The man 's arm was amputated and he was sent home . There were no more false alarms . I am told that General Washington thought seriously of court-martiallingme for the dismembering of a soldier . He was dissuaded . It should be noted that my plan to harass Staten Island was finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drunken general , the Scots peer Lord Stirling . Not knowing the terrain , he failed . Monmouth Court HouseAlthough I tend to think of the Revolution as a time of bitter cold , my own disaster took place on one of ' the hottest days in the history of a longp90life , June 28 , 1778 . What the cold could not accomplish the brutal heat very nearly did . My health was lost to me for five years and any effectiveness I may have had as an officer in the field ended at the battle of Monmouth Court House . There was a considerable celebration in early May at Valley Forge . Not only had the army survived the winter ( and Washington outwitted the cabals against him ) but word came to us that the French government had officially recognised the United States of America ; best of all , not only were the French sending out a fleet to help us but their navy had already begun a blockade of the English Channel . We were certain now that we would win . On a fine May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France , fired thirteen rounds of precious powder , arranged a good deal of food under a bower , gave a gill of rum to every man , and generally created the impression that all things were at last possible for us , not least victory . General Lee was on hand , recently exchanged for a British general . Some time before Lee had been mysteriously captured while visiting a lady in a tavern : mysteriously because some suspected Washington of having arranged the capture to remove a rival . Lee was brilliant , vain , fascinating , and we soon became good friends . It is significant that the only general officer I was ever close to was the only one to be court-martialled and broken . I plainly lacked Wilkinson 's doggedness in pursuing those commanders who might help me up in the world . Yet for all of Jamie 's adroitness , he finally managed to get himself involved in so many plots and counter-plots at Valley Forge that General Gates eventually threatened him with a duel while Washington , whose nose for intriguers was keen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In this occupation Jamie was able to steal money in small quantities which was to be expected ; unfortunately , he neglected to clothe the army and was let go . I use the word " dogged " to describe Wilkinson 's pursuit of honour  --  no , place  --  through the cultivation of important men . But Wilkinson was positively desultory in this occupation compared to Hamilton who wanted honour for itself alone , as did the best of us . I have often thought what a difficult time Hamilton must have had , forced to serve a man whose mind he despised . Certainly they were an incongruous pair . The solemn slow general waddling with dignity through the camp , while like a ginger terrier at his heel frisked the young impertinent aide . Washington plainly adored I lanlilton , and must never have realized to what extent the beloved youth disliked hint . But thenp91Washington was not in the habit of friendship with men or women ( I have known well many of those who were close to him and I have heard of no women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virginia who was , according to Jemmy Madison , more spiritual sister than inamorata ) . What affections he might have had were tightly reined in . The decorous relationship with his wife Martha was simply an alliance between properties , and typical of Washington 's ambition , of his cold serpent 's nature . Also , from the age of forty-three Washington was forced not only to play but to be the god of America . This meant that he could have no friends among his contemporaries , for any one of them might have proved to be a rival . As a result , his affections tended to centre on young men who were no threat to his eminence . Watching him , however , with a contemporary and equal like Charles Lee was a marvellously droll spectacle . The usually majestic Washington would become the clumsy courtier : diffident , halting , given to sudden blushes , and then , at the right moment , a knife would flash in the dark and another rival would be stunned to discover that the dull , obsequious Virginia gentleman had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hamilton was plainly unrequited , it was more than compensated for by the adoration proffered him by that vivacious young Frenchman the Marquis de Lafayette , who joined our Revolution at Valley Forge . Lafayette was one of a number of glory-minded Europeans who came to help us battle tyranny . Of these foreigners , only Von Steuben had military talent . A marvellous liar who had put it about that he was lieutenant-general to Frederick the Great when the highest rank he ever held was captain , Von Steuben proved to he equally marvellous at training men . As for Lafayette , he was all youthful enthusiasm and charm and silliness . Incidentally , he had the most unusual head I have ever seen ; it came to a point at the top like a pineapple . He worshipped Washington , who was so overwhelmed by the young man 's ardour that he allowed him nearly to lose us the battle of Monmouth Court House . Thinking back , we must have been a strange-looking assembly . Although Washington was in full immaculate uniform , the rest of us were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should note that Benedict Arnold had arrived on the scene ; he was constantly hobbling along at Washington 's side , talking into his ear . Arnold had recently been passed over for promotion , which did his native bad temper no good . Gates was there , too , much chastened since the collapse of the conspiracy . And of course the burly I , ord Stirling who was always attended by hisp92aide James Monroe , whose principal task during the Revolution was to keep His Lordship 's cup filled until it was time to put him to bed . What a small group it was that fought the Revolution , founded the republic , and governed the better part of a continent for a quarter-century ! And so many of the future governors were present at Valley Forge , drinking rum and water in a bower of green branches , and toasting the king of France . When the celebration was done , I joined General Lee and several of his admirers in a farm-house . Dishevelled , ill-shaven , eyes a-glitter , Lee sat with feet on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ) at his feet , and regaled us with tales of his captivity at Philadelphia . " Most civil the British were to me . Particularly the senior officers . Good fellows mostly . And how they hate this war ! Blame it all on their politicians . Every night we 'd drink together and toast the end of the war and the hanging of the politicians ; of all the politicians in the world except His Excellency . " Lee winked . He had a special way of saying " His Excellency " that conveyed in each respectful syllable absolute contempt . " General Clinton wants to give up Philadelphia . Move back to New York . He 's trying to persuade the ministry in London either to abandon the colonies altogether , which is not likely , or settle for holding New York indefinitely . He 's sick of the war . They all are . If he does move out of Philadelphia , I told His Excellency that we should do nothing to stop him . Quite the contrary . Build the British a bridge of gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've won . It 's all over . The French have decided the war in our favour and the day their fleet appears off Long Island the British will go home . Unhappily , His Excellency hungers for a victory in the field . I think he has grown tired of exaggerating what happened during that skirmish at Trenton . Although he now believes that he ranks with Marlborough and Frederick , he also knows that when people speak of American victories they speak of mine and Gates 's and never , never of his . So I predict that as the British withdraw he will attempt a set battle with the British . I also predict that no matter how great our initial advantage , he will fail as he always does . " If nothing else , Lee was a good prophet . In June the British under General Clinton evacuated Philadelphia and began the long trek to New York City . I attended the staff meeting where Washington presented his plan for attacking the enemy while they were in train . As usual , he elicited agreement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowing the British to withdraw . As much as I respected Lee , I think Washington'sstrategy , in theory , was sound . But in execution it was , as always with our famous commander , a disaster or in this case a near disaster.  |p93Washington  made his error at the very beginning . Overwhelmed by the exuberant Lafayette 's passion for renown ( not to mention for his commander 's august legend ) , Washington first proposed that the French youth lead the assault with General Lee 's troops . Lee was rightfully angry . So Washington patched together , as only he could , a fatally divided command . If Lafayette attacked the enemy first , Lee would stand aside while he earned glory . Should Lafayette not have seized a hero 's laurels by the time Lee appeared on the scene , then Lee would take command . It was the sort of stupid compromise that works marvellously well in a congressbut not at all on the field of battle . Final idiocy , Washington at the last moment re-arranged a number of companies in such a way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were commanding . So much for the grand design . Although not a general , I was given command of a brigade that included my own regiment and parts of two other Pennsylvania regiments . I had an excellent second-in-command , Lieutenant-Colonel Bunner , and , all in all , I was content . Yet by the morning of July 27 , as I mounted my horse in a rain which was , without too much exaggeration , scalding , I began to sense disaster . Soldiers often do . Some electrical quality in the air communicates hours in advance victory , defeat , pain , death . I was part of Lord Stirling 's division that commanded the American left , to the west of Monmouth Court House where the British army was entrenched . On orders from Stirling we spent the entire day and night of the 27th in the open , under a tropical sun that did us more damage than British guns . We were all light in the head . Many fainted ; and some suffered paroxysms from the stroke . We were also prey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and most resourceful . Before the sun was up on the 28th I was leading my brigade along a sandy lane to the west and south of Monmouth Court House . There was ; i constant ringing in my head . Yet I was lucid , and can recall to this day the look of the spindly heat-withered pines that edged the road  --  trail , rather ; can recall how the sergeant just behind me kept whistling over and over again the same two bars of " The World Turn 'd Upside Down , " a song popular with the British army . By noon we were on the high ground just west of a certain ravine on whose opposite side the advance troops of our wing of the army were supposed to make their first attack . I ordered a halt , to await orders . Beneath us was a mosquito-whining swamp crossed by a narrow footbridge . On the far side , a forest and , somewhere , the enemy . I ordered the men into battle osition . This was not easy , for every fewp94minutes someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I exhorted the men not to drink too much water but since I could not be everywhere , dozens of bellies were soon swollen and cramped from guzzling . I , too , was inconvenienced by a diarrhoea that was to remain with me for the next five years , despite an invalid 's diet . Shortly after noon we heard the first loud hollow blast of cannon . In all there were five reports from the direction of the court-house . Then silence . Another hour passed . Alarmed , I despatched a lieutenant to Lord Stirling with a request for orders . At about three in the afternoon when the sun burned like a flaming cannon-ball above the pine-wood , battle was joined . Off to our right , but out of sight , we could hear the clatter of musketry fire ; the whiz and thud of artillery . The Lafayette-Lee division after a long mysterious delay had begun to fight . Suddenly I saw a flash of scarlet in the woods opposite . Simultaneously , scouts reported that a British detachment was now advancing through the woods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I gave the order for attack . Indian file , the men started to cross the bridge while I maintained a covering fire . In a matter of minutes the entire brigade would have been safely across the bridge and under cover . But fate intervened . One of Washington 's aides materialised . " Stop those men , Colonel ! " Wild eyes met mine . I thought him mad , " I ca n't stop them . They 're moving to take cover before the British get our range . " " Stop them ! Recall them ! It is General Washington 's order . " I swung my horse in such a way that it looked as if he had shied from the sound of bullets . Pretending to have heard nothing , I rode to the bridge . Something like a third of the brigade was now on the other side . Behind a row of pines the British were getting our range . The aide followed me . " Colonel , I order you in the name of the commanding general to withdraw those men . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literally , an order based on Washington 's ignorance of the terrain , not to mention terror at the thought of yet another defeat : unknown to us at the edge of the swamp , General Lee had abruptly withdrawn from the advance position and many of his troops had interpreted the command to withdraw to mean retreat ; and for the American soldier retreat is best done through Hight . Washington himself stopped the rout and ordered ( ; eneral I , ce back to his post with a series of ' violent oaths . I'hen , after some hesitation ,  |p95Washington  decided to remain where he was and to stop the rest of us from advancing . Thus we lost , fatally , the initiative , thanks to Lee 's abrupt withdrawal and to Washington 's refusal to do more than make a perfunctory feint at the British position . What might have been a clear-cut victory for us was no more than a skirmish , ultimately beneficial to the outnumbered British who ought , in the normal course , to have been destroyed . " These men will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was adamant : right or wrong , Washington must be obeyed. 1 stopped the crossing of the bridge . Safe in the woods , the enemy was now able to pick off one by one our men . As I rode up and down our side of the swamp , shouting at the men to take cover , to return the enemy 's fire , I suddenly found myself flung like a stone through the air . The whole world had indeed gone upside down , I remember thinking as pine-trees up-ended around me . I fell with a crash onto a sandy bank , winded but not hurt ; my horse killed . As I got to my feet , I saw Colonel Bunner being shot dead at the bridge . One third of the brigade was now dead ; as many wounded . The night was as hot as day . A copper moon illuminated the pine-wood where exhausted men slept ; where the wounded moaned , gasped for breath , trying to live , to die . I nursed the wounded until shortly before dawn when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun was well up . As a result I was dried out like an Egyptian mummy which I somewhat resembled . I had also been bled while I slept by a thousand mosquitoes . I could hardly walk . In this highly debilitated state I learned to my disgust if not surprise that ( unknown as usual to Washington , who had spent the night sleeping at the side of Lafayette on a mantel beneath the stars ) the British army had departed , and were now safely on their way to Staten Island . The plan to intercept them had entirely failed ; and we had sustained heavy casualties for nothing . Such was the " victory " for George Washington at Monmouth Court House . When awakened by the news that the British army had escaped , Washington 's response was characteristic . He arrested General Lee for disobedience , and ordered a court-martial . I openly supported Lee , as did many others . Washington took note of us all , and few of Lee 's admirers were to earn promotion . I even corresponded at some length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point he wrote me that regardless of whatever sentence was imposed ( a year 's suspension from duty , as it turned out ) , he intended top96quit the army and " retire to Virginia , and learn to hoe tobacco , which 1 find is the best school to form a consummate general . " I should note here two curious pieces of information that I was given in London by a permanent clerk at the war ministry . I do not vouch for their authenticity . The first was that when Charles Lee was captured by the British , they threatened to hang him for a deserter from the British army . To save his neck he persuaded them to let him go on condition that he persuade Washington not to interfere with their withdrawal to New York . When he failed to persuade Washington , he ordered the disastrous retreat at Monmouth Court House , saving the British army . The other information I find easier to believe : that during the Adams administration Alexander Hamilton was British Agent Seven , and paid for by London . Jefferson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of treason and I never took his charges seriously . With the breaking of Lee , Washington reigned supreme as military genius in the eyes of the states . Although Washington was never to defeat an English army , he had now won a far more important war  --  the one with his rvials . " What was Washington 's most notable trait ? " I once asked Hamilton when we were working together on a law case . The quick smile flashed in that bright face , the malicious blue eyes shone . " Oh , Burr , self-love ! Self-love ! What else makes a god ? " West PointI SPENT TWO DAYS ' sick-leave near Paramus , at the Hermitage , with my future wife Theodosia Prevost . Then , ill as I was , I accepted Washington'sappointment as a sort of spy to try and discover whatever possible about the enemy 's shipping . With a small group of men we ranged up and down the North River from Weehawk to Bergen , collecting gossip , some of it useful. 1 was then given the task of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to British-held New York City . This might have been enjoyable duty had I not been suffering from debilitating headaches as well as diarrhoea . In October I asked to be given sick-leave without pay . I wanted to be under no obligation to Washington who granted the leave but insisted that I take full pay . Since this was unacceptable , I felt obliged to rejoin my regiment at West Point where I was promptly mistaken by a local farmer for Colonel Burr 's son.  |p97THIS  SECTION breaks off . The Westchester LineJANUARY 13 , 1779 , I ARRIVED at White Plains to take command of theWestchester Line that stretched some fourteen miles between the Hudson River and Long Island Sound . Below the line was New York City , the British army , and their friends the American Tories . It was my task to regulate the passage of traffic between Tory New York and Whig Westchester . As it turned out , my actual work was to stop the plundering of the civilians who lived in the area . Stealing was the chief occupation not only of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In fact , plunder was the principal occupation of what seemed to be half the population of Westchester . Those who stole from the Tories and the British were called Skinners . Those who stole from us were called Cowboys . By the spring of 1779 , Skinners and Cowboys had been largely done away with ; my health , too . On March i o , I sent my resignation to General Washington who accepted it with the polite sentiment that he " not only regretted the loss of a good officer , but the cause which made his resignation necessary . " Through Enemy LinesAT THE END of May 1779 , I was at West Point visiting General McDougall . Despite poor health , he was a fine officer and eloquent despite a stammer . We sat out-of-doors beneath tall elms , overlooking the Hudson River . Aides came and went from the large frame-house he used as headquarters . There was a certain amount of stir that day , for 6,000 British troops had just left New York City and were now landing on both sides of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some days to get word to Washington in New Jersey . But none of his messengers had got through . McDougall was indignant at the course the war had taken , or not taken . " That Congress ! " He spoke with a trace of Scots accent . " I swear they are the worst men in the country ! " All soldiers agreed . It was well-known that those few delegates who bothered to attend the Continental Congress preferred currency speculation to supporting the army . But then Congress thought that the war was as good as over.  |p98Washington  himself had led them to believe that with the arrival of the French fleet our victory was assured . In due course , the French fleet did arrive and Washington was able tomake his long-anticipated strike at New York . Between the French fleet and the American army the British were as good as dead or so everyone thought , not taking into account Washington 's gift for defeat which once again carried the day . To begin fit to acquaint the French admiral d'Estaingwith , no one saw with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result , when the hour ofbattle arrived , the French fleet could not pass the bar at the harbour entrance while Washington 's favourite general , John Sullivan , in attempting to carry out his master 's strategy , ignominiously lost the field to the British garrison . In disgust , the French fleet sailed south . " I tell you , Burr , if it was n't for the French fleet in the English Channel , the British would drive us clear to the Ohio . " McDougall stammered over the second " b " as though the word so begun was too vile to complete . We would have been even more disturbed if we had known that the war was going to continue in desultory fashion for three more years with Washington avoiding , as much as possible , all military action . Partly because inaction was now congenial to his nature ; partly because the army of some 14,000 he had commanded at the famous " victory " of Monmouth I Court House had now dwindled to almost nothing through lack of funds , and through a mystical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was somehow bound to be ours simply because of the French alliance . At the end of the war when Washington arrived in Virginia to join the siege of Yorktown , he commanded only 2,500 men while French troops at Yorktown numbered 3,000 in addition to their fleet of more than thirty ships of the line . So in a sense Congress was right . The French did defeat the British for us . Certainly without them we would still be British colonies ; a distressing fact we have long since forgotten just as we are currently trying to forget how easy it was for a small British army detachment to drive President Madison from the White House and set the torch to Washington City . Fortunately our people have always preferred legend to reality  --  as I know best of all , having become one of the dark legends of the republic , and hardly real . McDougall listened to the whisper of an aide . Swore another oath . " You go to Washington , Burr . You know the country . " The mule story . Washington and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NARRATIVE stops at this point . Then another fragment , on different paper , of recent date . Benedict Arnold . Noted June 4 , 1833IN THE AUTUMN of 178o I was at the Hermitage with Mrs. Prevost , who had kindly undertaken the considerable task of keeping me alive . At her insistence I drank a gallon of spring water a day and felt rather the worse for it . The treachery of Benedict Arnold was exciting the country that season . For some time Arnold had been disaffected . He had been unjustly passed over for promotion . Then because of his damaged foot , he was not suited  --  it was thought  --  to take an active command . So Washington made him military governor of Philadelphia after the British left . In this post , Arnold strutted about like a Roman proconsul ; all he lacked was lictors at his portly side . His quarrelsome and autocratic nature was further exacerbated by too much drink . Yet he did contrive to marry the prettiest girl in town , Peggy Shippen , whose family had been kind to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American gentry , the Shippens were pro-British Tories . In fact , during the British occupation of Philadelphia , Peggy had nearly married an attractive British officer named Major Andre . Careless , venal , offensive in his manner , Arnold got himself into all sorts of trouble not only with the Pennsylvania Assembly but with the Congress itself , a group of thieves quite capable of recognising Arnold as one of their own , and in need of watching . Various charges were brought against him . Although he was eventually exonerated , the trials he had undergone made him more bitter than ever  --  if that was possible . To placate Arnold , Washington offered him an attractive field command . Arnold rejected it ; his health was not good . He would accept , however , the command at West Point on the Hudson , a most insignificant post for an important general . Taken aback , Washington pointed out to Arnold that West Point 's garrison was made up of invalids while the post 's only function was surveillance of the river and as a centre for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Unknown to us all , Arnold was now a British agent with instructions to turn over West Point to the enemy . He would have succeeded if the British spy Major Andre had not been captured with **26;27;TOOLONG . Simultaneously , Washington , Lafayette and Hamilton arrivedat West Point on a tour of inspection . In a panic , Arnold abandoned the beautiful Peggy and took refuge aboard the British ship Vulture in the river . Peggy then went mad ; raved at Washington , accused him of murdering her child whose father , she declared , was Hamilton , much to that young satyr 's embarrassment . I can imagine His Excellency 's thoughtful dull gaze as he slowly , slowly considered the pros and cons of the matter . Finally , Washington sent Peggy home to Philadelphia under military escort . This much of the story was known to us in Paramus that autumn evening when a carriage and horsemen clattered up the drive . Servants answered the door . Theodosia was alarmed . So was I. For all we knew the British were on the move . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veiled figure appeared in the doorway . " The iron ! The hot iron ! " The voice rang out . The figure staggered . Theodosia rushed forward to support her old friend Peggy Shippen Arnold . Servants and children gathered wide-eyed as Peggy reeled toward the sofa by the fire . " My baby ! They have killed my baby ! " But a nurse with a child looked in for a moment and said , " I have baby . She wants a bed . " Theodosia sent a servant to prepare beds for mother and child . Then Major Franks from Washington 's staff entered and saluted me . " I am Mrs. Arnold 's escort to Philadelphia . She particularly wanted to spend the night here . " " You are all welcome . " The bewildered Theodosia ordered a room for the Major who immediately went upstairs , whispering to me as he did , " She 's in one of her fits now . They come and go . " Peggy , meanwhile , had taken up her position before the fireplace . She looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaze . She had known Theodosia all her life , regarded her as an older sister . " There he is , the murderer ! " Peggy pointed a long finger at me . It was most effective . I later used with much success the same gesture and tone of voice in the course of a murder trial . Peggy grasped her brow . " The iron ! Hot ! Hot ! Hot as the flames of Hell ! " This would not do , even from a madwoman . Theodosia made a shushing sound and sent everyone from the room except me . Peggy sobbed for a long time in her veil . Then she dried her eyes briskly and said , " By God , Theodosia , if I have to go on like this onep101more day I will go out of my mind . Hello , Aaron . We 've not seen each other since . . . " " You were a child . How , " I could not help asking the actress , " is the hot iron now ? " " Considerably cooler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was again the most charming girl of her day . Theodosia was more puzzled than I. " Are you really all right , Peggy ? " " Of course she is . Peggy has been play-acting . " I had suspected her from the moment of her entrance . " Better play-acting than a jail . " Peggy gave me a hard look . " Is Aaron all right ? " " In what way ? " Theodosia was an innocent in these matters . I was not . " She means will I tell General Washington that she fooled him . No , I wo n't . That is , if she does n't try to fool us . " " I would never do that ! Well , I would if I had to . You 're not Tory , are you ? " I said I was not . I had been devoted to the Revolution from the first day , and so was a proper Whig . Peggy made a face . " Well , I have hated your Revolution ' from the first day . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bold of me but Peggy was boldness itself . " I have no way of knowing . " Peggy was matter-of-fact . " That was before I met him . I do know how badly he was treated by the Congress , by Mr. Washington who . . . " She suddenly broke out laughing , and I feared that she was about to favour us with another mad scene but she was sane , and much amused . " You should have seen His Excellency ! When I realized my husband was in danger , I took to my bed . I had to convince everyone that I knew nothing of what was going on . So I claimed that Colonel Varick was trying to kill my baby and that a hot iron was burning my head and . . . " " Where did you get that marvellous hot iron from ? " Theodosia had an inquiring nature . " I read it somewhere , a story about a poor woman in Bedlam . The iron , the hot iron ' ! " Peggy boomed until we begged her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Washington who looked frightened to death and sent for Mr. Hamilton , that lovely young goose . . . " " Peggy ! " Theodosia obviously did not like to think of us precocious colonels as geese , lovely or otherwise . " Oh , a perfect goose , believe me With him I changed my manner.  |p102Became  conspiratorial . Tete-a-tete . I was wearing a handsome lace bedgown , the latest thing from London , sent me last summer by Major Andre . " Peggy frowned . " They wo n't shoot him , will they ? " We did not know it but Major Andre had already been hanged as a spy . " I rather think we will . " I was hard , too hard , for I have since been told not only that Peggy and the Major were lovers before she married Arnold but that their affair continued even after , and that Peggy helped Andre to corrupt her new husband . Between die wife playing on Arnold 's sense of injury and Major Andre offering him money ( and the King 's commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went over to the enemy and , good commander that he was , did our cause much injury in the field before the French won the war for us . As I have said before , Arnold was a superb commander . " Of course , Major Andre might be exchanged for General Arnold . " I could not resist playing on her terror . She was also devoted to her lunatic husband . " The British would never give him up . - Not even for  --  for him . " Theodosia and I often discussed this scene during the years of our marriage , meditating upon Peggy 's exquisite dilemma . The old lover 's life and the new husband 's life for an instant were in the balance . Peggy was a remarkable girl , with a quick intelligence . Tribute to her quickness was the fact that she was able in one day to dupe Washington , Hamilton and Lafayette . But then she was a professional spy . When I was in London , I learned that in I782 she received some 400 pounds from the British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest was her marriage to Benedict Arnold , and her conversion of a truculent malcontent into prodigious traitor . Peggy was in her glory that night at Paramus . She must have thought herself a perfect success . Yet she had destroyed her husband , for the British were plainly losing the war . But then she had the sort of febrile personality that is happy only in a desperate , preferably losing situation in which a vivid role can be enacted like Joan at the stake . Politically she was uncommonly zealous . Her father had been a Tory judge in Philadelphia and she had learned from him and his circle of friends to detest anyone who questioned England 's majesty and the rights of property . Feet on the fire fender , like a handsome boy , Peggy told us of her interview with Colonel Hamilton at West Point . " I said I knew nothing of my husband 's activity . And then I wept , verysoftly , holding his arm very close to me . I Ic is most susceptible , is n't he ? " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ susceptibility " wasp103unknown to me at that time . Later of course he became notorious for his  --  I almost wrote " lecheries " but who am I to use such a word for life 's best pleasure ? I will say that Hamilton was a fool where women were concerned , and often embarrassed his partisans , not to mention his noble , long-suffering Schuyler wife . " Anyway I persuaded him that I wanted only to come home to Philadelphia , to my family . I threw myself upon his mercy . He was so moved at this that he put his free hand on my arm ever so gently . . . " " Peggy , you should be soundly spanked . " Theodosia was more direct than I ; also of the two of us , she was the more knowing in the ways of people . " You are unkind . " But Peggy enjoyed arousing her old friend ; wanted to disturb my impassivity . " I said that I feared the crowd . Feared for my life . " She frowned . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Whigs do to me in Pennsylvania ? " " Invite you to all their parties , I should think , and ask you to play Ophelia . " Theodosia was not as amused by Peggy as I was . " Colonel Hamilton said that he would intercede with General Washington , which he did . I then had almost the same interview with the Marquis de Lafayette in French ! " A servant entered to call away the mistress of the house . When Theodosia was gone , Peggy stretched like a cat in front of the fire . Then she looked me straight in the eye , the way she used to when we were children and wanted her way . " Well ? " from Peggy . " Well ? " I did not respond . She crossed to me . Took my hands in hers and looked me in the eye . " I 've talked too much . I do n't usually go on like this . " " It was most interesting . " " You do n't approve of what we did ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemies of England ! " There was real passion in her voice . " I hate what your Virginia dolt is doing to our world . " I assured her that it would still be our world when the war ended ; but without the inconvenience of paying taxes to England . She would not believe me . " It will not be ours but theirs , those wild men from the woods , from the water frontage , from the worst stews of the towns . They 'll take everything ! " Peggy sounded like one of today 's New York ladies deploring Andrew Jackson . Only she had done more than deplore ; she had sacrificed everything.  | " Well , no matter who owns the country , Peggy , you 'll have no part in it . The English will go home and you will go with them and never come back . " " I believe we 'll win . But if we do n't , I will be happy to go . " She was so close to me that I could smell the sharp odour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then learned to recognise as corresponding with a phase of the moon . She tried to draw me toward her but I got my hands free . " I am to marry Theodosia . " Peggy gave me a furious look , threw herself into a chair beside the fire . " She is old enough to be your mother . " " Hardly . " But Theodosia was ten years older than I. Her late husband had been a colonel in the British army . She had no fortune . I was aware that in the world 's eye this was the poorest sort of match for a rising young man to make . Yet to me Theodosia was everything I ever wanted in a woman except that she was not my daughter , too ; fortunately , she provided me with a second Theodosia before her death and my happiness  --  for a short time  --  was complete . Yet I confess that evening at Paramus I did not much enjoy Peggy 's taunt . " Now you 'll betray me . " Peggy 's face was foolish with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anticipated me . " Put briefly , Benedict Arnold was a fool and Peggy was a greater one . Fearing that I might reveal the extent of her complicity , Peggy promptly put it about that I had made advances to her at Paramus . This was in character . Actually , I kept her secret until now . I like to think that my discretion was equally in character.  |p105SHORTLY  BEFORE NOON , the main door to the office was flung open . Icy air filled the room . Mr. Craft 's latest brief floated toward the grate . One of the young clerks rushed to slam the door only to find that it framed a bright-faced Aaron Burr and two heavy-set men who looked rather the worse for what must have been a long walk in the cold . Their hands and cheeks were flame colour . The Colonel simply looked fresh . " Heigh-ho ! " he exclaimed . " I am  --  as you see  --  back ! " He is as hearty as ever ; does not even walk with a stick . Burr led the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did , for various papers that he wanted . Mr. Craft was quietly pleased . " They can not kill the Colonel . " The dour face was filled with dark significance . " You mean Madame and Nelson Chase ? " Mr. Craft shook his head . The dark significance , apparently , is his way of expressing undue pleasure , something I have not often noted in the five years we have worked together . I lc seldom discusses anything with me except our work and the day 's tenipx  --  rature . Weather means a lot to him.  | " Life ! " Mr. Craft exclaimed . Apparently life could not kill Aaron Burr . I left the sense of that unexplored . " You would do well to study his . . . " Mr. Craft lowered his voice to make sure that the two clerks did not hear him . " . . . style . In his day he was the first gentleman of New York . And one of the first gentlemen in the land . " " He was vice-president , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not office-holding knave ! His father , his grandfather , his great-grandfather , back to the beginning , were great divines and presidents of universities . That is why he was so envied by Hamilton , by that . . . " The voice lowered to a whisper in my ear . " . . . that West Indian bastard ! How they all envied him ! From the gutter they came , while Aaron Burr was our first gentleman . " After all our years of work together , Mr. Craft has at last revealed himself to be , most unexpectedly , a classic New York snob . I have always thought that the most appealing thing about Alexander Hamilton was his illegitimacy . But then I am not impressed by " divines . " There was the sound of voices raised in disagreement from the next room . Then Colonel Burr called my name . I went inside . " I would , " said one of the men sharply , " like very much to be paid the money . " And I would , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , five generations of " divines " ? ) , " like very much to pay you the money . But I can not  --  for the present . Mr. Schuyler , you will now have my full attention . Gentlemen , good day . " As the Colonel shut the door after his creditors , he was in a merry mood . " We must complete your education to-night with something truly profound . " He bit the end from a seegar . " You have been reading Gibbon ? " " I am in the third volume . " I lied . " I shall query you about him to-night . At the Park Theatre . I have bought tickets to see the unique Miss Fanny Kemble and her father in what I fear is a foolish play called The Hunchback . " I expressed delight that was not feigned . Actually I had seen Miss Kemble in the part last September when she made her first appearance here , and took the town by storm . She is a marvellous fiery creature on stage , though not beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Siddons . Colonel Burr lit his seegar and did what can only be described as a dance step . " Free ! " he intoned . " Free ! " Then he confided to me that he had left the Heights , " for the last time . A heart of gold , Madame has . No doubt of it ! What fills her purse , youp107might say , also beats in her fine bosom . The tick-tick of gold , Charlie , what a sound ! The world dances to its measure . " Another half dance step and he was at his chair beside the baize table . The fire glowed in the hearth . I thought , suddenly , here is a happy man . Why ? " For reasons of temperament , we have decided to go our separate ways for a time . Our marriage is in abeyance . I need the stimulus of the town . Madame is happy only at the mansion , receiving Bonapartes . It is possible she will try to divorce me , but I hope not . I have promised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her four broken-down bays . Make a note to send her a barrel of salted salmon . It is her favourite . My first wife 's favourite , too . " The Colonel shut his eyes . With pain ? Recollection ? Neither . " Have you prepared the bill of particulars I wanted for the DePeyster case ? " " I have begun it , only . . . " Through the smoke he gave me his most Burrite aphorism . " Excellent , Charlie . Never do today what you can do tomorrow because who knows what may turn up ? " Miss Kemble was superb as Julia . Her father was also effective as the Hunchback . The theatre 's new decorations are most sumptuous  --  everythinggold and crimson on cream , with a portrait of Shakespeare over the proscenium arch and representations of comedy and tragedy on either side of the stage where mirrors used to be . Only the audience was a disappointment . The boxes were half-filled with enthusiastic gentry , including the Colonel and me . The pit , on the other hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Five Points to boo not the performers  --  or there would have been a riot  --  but the theatre 's manager , Mr. Edmund Simpson , who is thought to prefer British to American players , which is nonsense because his principal attraction is our own Edwin Forrest . It is nothing more than a foolish competition between the Park Theatre and the Bowery Theatre , whose manager Tom Hamblin hired these ruffians to shout and bray , particularlyduring the orchestral interludes . This rattles all the musicians except the Cockney known as Mr. Drum . Between bars Mr. Drum sleeps , as oblivious to the noise in the pit as he is to the conductor . But somehow he never misses a cue . He is the loudest drummer in New York . The Bowery Theatre has also enlisted the Evening Post in its support , and Leggett himself has taken to attacking the Park Theatre . Understandably , Mr. Simpson has banned him from the theatre . Meanwhile , in a cheap gesture for sympathy , the Bowery Theatre changed its name to the American ' I'hcatre on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the stars and stripes.  |p108During  the entr'acte , I stand with Colonel Burr at the door that looks out onto Broadway and St. Paul 's . The church is lighted within . A service ? Between the golden glow from the church 's windows and the white glare from the theatre 's lobby , large snow-flakes like feathers slowly turn and fall . The Colonel , as usual , pretends to keep his eyes on me , as though rivetted by what I am saying . Actually , it is to avoid the possibility of being publicly cut by someone . " She is a fine animal , Charlie , no doubt of that ! " Miss Kemble had stimulated him but then is there any man who can resist that mighty yet womanly voice ? I have written a study of her acting which The Mirror is considering for publication . " I thought , Colonel , you believed that women had souls , were not animals . " I was amused . " But the soul has its fleshly envelope . Besides , I have yet to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . So many people who do have souls are bestial . " As we talked , I glanced at the people in the audience . Many of the older ones were aware of the Colonel 's presence and stared at him with fascination , even horror . The young know him not , or anything else . Patrons of the Park Theatre boxes tend to be rich . They hate the President , adore Clay and Webster . I am writing now about politics not because I care how the Park Theatre audience votes but because I was jostled twice by a man with a heavy beard and thick spectacles . The firsttime I simply moved away . The second time , when he stepped on my foot , I turned , ready to do battle  --  and then recognised through a full dark false beard William Leggett . " Do n't I look like the prophet Isaiah ? " " I do n't know what the prophet Isaiah looked like . " My toe hurt . Then I introduced him to Colonel Burr who was as gracious as Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be here , " Leggett whispered . " Simpson has threatened to fight a duel with me . For me , the cane . For him , the adverb . " Leggett suddenly stopped : in the house of the hanged man , do not mention rope . But the Colonel was serene . " A most sensible choice of weapons . Personally I have always regarded duelling as a terrible business . " " Of course . Barbaric . But then . . . " Leggett actually stammered . The false whiskers slipped a bit ; the moustache covering under as well as upper lip . " But in my barbarous day , we had no choice . It was a code we felt obliged to live by . "  |p109Leggett  straightened his beard . " But you were fortunate , Colonel . You were a fine shot and so had every advantage in those barbarous days . " Leggett had gone too far but the Colonel handled him with his usual niceness of manner . " I seldom try to correct legend . For one thing , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret unknown until now . " Leggett 's eyes gleamed . He leaned down , ear close to the Colonel 's mouth . Burr was suitably mysterious . " Despite all my years as a soldier , Mr. Leggett , I can seldom at twenty paces hit with accuracy a barn-door . " " You are too modest , Sir . " Burr laughed . " Not at all . But perhaps I have been too lucky . Some years ago in Utica , a group of men asked me to give them an exhibition . I said I was indisposed . But they said they must see Aaron Burr display his marksmanship . So I indicated a notch on a tree some distance away . Would they like me to hit it ? Indeed they would . " Burr 's eyes glittered . " Well , with a single casually aimed shot , I pierced the centre of the notch . " " You see . . . " began Leggett . " You see , " finished Burr , " it was my luck . Nothing more . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begged off . As a result , to this day there are people in Utica who will swear on oath that I am the best marksman that ever lived . " " But of course there were other equally famous occasions when you hit your target . " I was ready to throttle Leggett right there in the lobby . Although the Colonel 's face remained fixed in a gentle smile , the voice dropped to a deeper but still amiable register . " Mr. Leggett , the principal difference between my friend Hamilton and me was that at the crucial moment his hand shook and mine never does . " The bell rang behind the green baize curtain . We went back to our seats . The rowdies were roaring in the pit . Mr. Drum was asleep on his stool . The orchestra fell silent as the oil lamp dimmed and the curtain rose . But I could not think of the play , only of Colonel Burr 's remarkable candour . It is the first time I have heard him mention the duel . After the play , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to father Kemble whom he knew in order to meet daughter Kemble whom he did not . Finally he decided against going back-stage . " It 's too late , and I must go to Jersey City . " Outside the theatre , I helped him on with his coat . The slow snow had been replaced by a cold steady wind from the North River that made the near-by museum 's shutters snap back and firth . Carriages crowded Broadway , waiting for the theatre-goers.  |p110The  Colonel and I crossed over to St. Paul 's ( the lights were gone ) . At the corner of Fulton Street we saw the now beardless Leggett ; he was supposed to have been picked up by a friend . " I ca n't think what went wrong . " Perhaps , " said the Colonel smoothly , " he did not recognise you clean-shaven . " Leggett laughed , coughed . " Without the beard I might have been assaulted by a murderous adverb . " " Ultimately ' ? " inquired the Colonel . " It is the fatal adverb in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Kembles ? " I changed the subject . Leggett said yes , he admired the Kembles very much , and so I said that I thought it shameful the Evening Post continues to attack them simply because of the management . As we argued , the Colonel started briskly down Fulton Street toward the docks . We hurried after . When told that the Colonel was going to Jersey City , Leggett was surprised . " But it 's too late . The ferries do n't run . And there 's a storm coming up . We were now on West Street just back of the funereal bulk of the Washington Market . " Ephraim ! " Burr shouted . " Here , Colonel ! " We made our way toward the dark slip where the son of one of the Colonel 's Revolutionary friends waited in his small boat . " Nice night , Ephraim . " " Real nice , Colonel . " A tall figure stood up in the shadowy boat and pulled tight the mooring line until the boat was against the dock , rising and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My God , it 's cold ! " Leggett was shivering uncontrollably . The Colonel took Ephraim 's arm and like a cat sprang into the boat . As Ephraim cast off , the Colonel waved to us . " Do n't you boys see thatthis is what makes it all fun ? " " I 'm freezing . " Leggett wrapped his cloak about his ears . Colonel Burr had heard him through the wind . " Put your beard back on , Mr. Leggett . It will keep you warm . " Then boat and Colonel vanished into sleety darkness and Leggett and I walked  --  no , ran  --  all the way to Thomas Street and Mrs. Townsend who took us into her front parlour , made us drink Columbia County apple-jack until the cold was out of our bones . Leggett spoke with reluctant admiration of Colonel Burr . Mrs. Townsend gave us a somewhat mystical smile . " I have beenp111reading his grandfather all evening . But then I often read Jonathan Edwards , for the terror ! " Mrs. Townsend believes in a dramatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a volume from the pile of books on the floor beside her sofa . Pages were marked with slips of paper . She opened at seeming random and read . " As innocent as children seem to be to us , yet if they are out of Christ they are not so in God 's sight , but are young vipers . ' Young vipers , " she repeated with satisfaction . She is celebrated for her loathing of children . Once in the street when a small child grabbed at her skirt , she wrenched it free , shouting , " Unclean ! " Some thought she referred to her skirt or , more likely , soul . But those who admire her know that she meant the child . " Will those children . . . that lived and died insensible of their misery , until they feel it in Hell , ever thank parents for not letting them know what they were in danger of ? ' " " Dreadful stuff , " said Leggett . " The sort of thing that would make a traitor to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " The Colonel is hardly a traitor to either God or man . " I came to Burr 's defence . But Mrs. Townsend was not finished with Jonathan Edwards . She had opened a larger volume , blew dust from a page , reducing Leggett to a fit of coughing as , inexorably , she read , " Let it be considered that if our lives be not a journey towards Heaven , they will be a journey to Hell . ' " She gave Leggett a long look . " It 's not the dust , " she whispered stagily , " but the dust to dust . " That stopped his coughing . " The two great receptacles of all that depart out of this world ; the one is Heaven , whither a few , a small number in comparison , travel . ' Ah , Mr. Leggett , contemplate those few ! " " I would rather contemplate Black Bess . " " It is her time of the month . We have something even better , twenty years old , from Ohio . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page . " And the other is Hell , whither the bulk . . . the bulk . . . the bulk of mankind do throng . And one or the other of these must be our journey 's end ; the issue of our course in this world . ' " Her voice fell silent ; the book shut softly ; dust motes spiralled in the lamplight . " I have been told , Mr. Leggett , Mr. Schuyler , too " ( I was also I lellward bound ) , " that on his death-bed John Randolph of Roanoke suddenly sat up , a top hat on his head , and said , over and over again , Remorse , remorse ! ' " " Randolph was mad and a eunuch . 1 am neither , dear Mrs. Townsend . " Leggett was irritable . 1 was restive . Mrs. Townsend gave us herp112yellow-fanged , dry-lipped smile and rang for the maid . " We have new delights , gentlemen . " Then she remembered . " But for you , Mr. Schuyler , there is an old ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Mrs. Townsend opened a copy of Jonathan Edwards ' The Freedom of the Will ( apparently , he does not believe in it ) as the maid arrived to show us to Hell 's ante-room . Helen was loving but hates the winter . Talks of spring . Of leaving Mrs. Townsend . I promise  --  before  --  to help her find work ; and mean what I say because  --  after  --  I tell her that I will ask friends who know about dress-makers . She told me that she has yet to see the Vauxhall Gardens . I promise to take her there the first good day in spring . Why is it no girl I meet in the usual way appeals to me the way she does ? even though I know she appeals it exactly the same way ( no , that is not possible , not the same ) to anyone who pays the price . Since there is no Heaven , how can there be Hell ? Leggett and I left Thomas Street together . He was pleased ; not ill as before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The apple-jack and the girls had warmed us up ; and the north wind had dropped . " I had not expected the Colonel to be so youthful . " " He is extraordinary ! " " You are fond of him . " This was almost a reproach . " Well , yes . I suppose I am . He takes an interest . How many people do in someone younger  --  in anyone for that matter ? " " What have you discovered ? " I confessed to very little . I did not tell him about the notes on the Revolution . " What about Mr. Irving ? " " Not informative , I 'm afraid . He 's very cautious , particularly on the subject of Van Buren . " " Sly old tabby-cat ! I do hate those comfortable stories of his . " I was shocked . " He is the best we have . . . " " That 's not saying much . You know , we 've just made an arrangement with Cooper to write for the Evening Post , under a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York after many years abroad . His arrival was hardly noticed ; unlike that of Irving , who took the town by storm . But then Irving is tactful while Cooper enjoys pointing out to his countrymen their shortcomings . Ile is to() prickly for our flag-waving patriots . " You know , " said Leggett , " after studying as carefully as I couldp113Colonel Burr 's head , I am more than ever convinced that he is the father of Van Buren . " Leggett is fascinated by the new science of phrenology . Apparently all the secrets of character are revealed by the bumps on the head . He has even suggested that I write something about phrenology for the EveningPost . For the moment , however , he had given me the last word . " I prefer looking carefully inside the Colonel 's head . That 's the only way of finding out who he is , and what he is to Van Buren . " " There is a contagion to the Colonel 's style . " That was the best he could do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As Leggett galloped down the street , the false beard slipped from his pocket and fell onto the icy cobbles where it lay like a dead kitten . IT IS APRIL . I have not had time  --  no , I have had the time but not the will  --  to continue this record . The Colonel lives either at Jersey City or in the office . There has been , as far as I can tell , no communication from Madame . Nelson Chase has gone to another law firm . I do n't know which . Some say he is working for Alexander Hamilton , Junior . That would be , as the Colonel would say , most neat . The Colonel is in fine spirits . He has taken on several new cases . He has also become somewhat absent of mind . Recently a client paid him fifty dollars . When she left , he put the money in a dictionary . As he was about to leave the office , he started to go through his pockets . " Charlie , I have no money . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you have ten dollars ? " " No , Sir . But you have fifty dollars in the dictionary . " Startled , he opened the book and took out the money he had only just hidden there . " You are my benefactor . It is a gift from Heaven . " But light as the manner was , I saw his distress : Burr without the splendid mind is nothing at all.  |p114But  the Colonel 's memory of the past is as sharp as ever . Shortly after New Year ( 1834 according to the gypsy woman will be the best year of my life ; but then she said that about 1833 ) , the Colonel asked me my opinion of his notes on the Revolution . " What is the mule story ' ? " Burr looked blank . " Mule story ' ? Oh , " he laughed . " I tell it only to children . You are much too big a boy . It 's a very long story about the mule I rode from West Point to Newburgh . I wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We ended up in a westerly direction , through a coal-mine . If you were younger , I would add many , many details , with appropriate sounds . " Then he spoke of the possibility of dictating to me his recollections . " While they are still lodged in what is left of my mind . " I encourage him ; am eager . But he is reluctant to begin ; delays . LEGGETT INVITED ME for lunch at the Washington Hall Hotel . At our table were Washington Irving , the literary congressman Gulian C. Verplanck ( currently the anti-Tammany candidate for mayor ) , and Fitz-Greene Halleck . Mr. Cooper and Mr. Bryant were supposed to join us but sent regrets . " Cooper detests Irving , " Leggett whispered in my ear as we sat down . But Irving detests no one or , if he does , is a capital actor . " I had looked forward to seeing my old friend Cooper . " Irving seemed most sincere . " He is not only a great man , he is a good man . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gravy fell onto his sleeve . " It 's not Holland House , " said Halleck , meaning I suppose some noble English house . " The food is excellent . " Irving glumly mopped up the gravy . Then Verplanck mentioned an attack on Irving in the North American Review . Irving affected not to have read it . " They say that you denigrate America , praise only things British . Imagine ! When you alone gave America a literature . Somewhat at the expense of us poor Dutch . . . " In his gruff way , Verplanck is not without malice . " I shall have a glass of claret . " Irving had finally caught a waiter 's attention , and leaned nervously to one side as wine was slopped into a dusty glass . Verplanck detailed , with obvious delight , the terrible charges the reviewer had made against Irving . But our lion of literature merely smiled and nodded and murmured for the historic record , " I never ceased top115represent my country abroad . And now that I am home  --  see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  fulfilment . " First the verbs began to drop from his sentences ; then the nouns . Finally , silence , as he drank his wine , cut turkey deftly , looked somewhat sleepy . Leggett questioned Verplanck about the election next week . Because Verplanck opposed Jackson who wants to replace the Bank of the United States with a number of local banks , he has been purged by Tammany but taken up by the Whigs ( the new name for those who are not Jacksonian Democrats ) . Verplanck expects to be elected mayor though he is happy in Congress . Leggett treats Irving deferentially but with a certain edge . " The Evening Post is printing Mr. Cooper soon . When will you write for us ? " Irving blinked his eyes rapidly . Cleared his throat . " Mr. Bryant 's poetry seems to me to be unique . Superior to Wordsworth 's , do n't you think ? Without Byron 's vulgarity or Coleridge 's opacity . " I gather most famous men are like this . They answer the same question so many times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong question . But Leggett pressed him . " We suspect you , Mr. Irving , of democracy . Irving responded with his crooked smile . At heart he is very much a Tory . One can see that in his manner , in his love of the past , of the quaint and the traditional ; not to mention in the company he keeps : he is friends with all the rich merchants of the city . But the sweep of the times is toward democracy , if Leggett is to be believed . Secretly I think Irving must hate what is happening ; yet , " I spent the winter at Washington City . Haunted the Capitol . Heard every debate , good and bad . What great orators we have ! Clay , Webster , Calhoun ! " " All Tories . " Leggett was relentless . " All brilliant men . But "  --  Irving looked to left and right to make sure that the other diners could not hear him , as if anyone could hear anything through the crash of plates , the shouts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen  --  " but mistaken , I think . " Cautiously , Irving came out against the Nullifiers . " The southerners are , you know , once you observe them in the Congress and talk to them in private , not entirely without  --  well , a degree of justice . " Irving is incapable of offending any part of his audience . " Yet , " he spoke before Leggett , " it is plain to me that if they have their way our general union will dissolve . " " A bad thing or not ? " Although I lalleck has the reputation for brilliance , today he was somewhat subdued ; stared at me when he thought I WaS not looking . Obviously puzzled to see nee there.  | " 1 should think it a bad thing . " Irving was dry . " But the south might be happier without us . " Leggett tried to question him about Van Buren but Irving affected to know nothing of the Vice-President 's plans . In a low voice Fitz-Greene Halleck asked me what I did . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is . But are you . . . literary or political ? " " I hate politics ! " Why not jump in with both feet ? Halleck smiled . " Good . So do I. But then I am an enemy of the people , and regard the ship of state like any other ship : for the captain to sail it safely he must never ever consult the crew . That is why I am for a king , any king , the more tyrannical the better . I also incline to the Roman Church because it saves you such a lot of bother . Your salvation is entirely taken care of by priests who are paid to do nothing else . " And so on . I found Halleck refreshing , and though he seems to be making jokes I think he is probably quite serious . As we rose from table , Halleck said something to Irving who turned and looked at me , and nodded . At the door to the dining-room , I stood back for the lions to pass . But Irving took my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You have made a most vivid impression on poor Halleck . " " Oh ? " was the best I could do , wondering why Halleck was " poor . " " You look so like his friend Joseph Rodman Drake . He was Halleck 's closest friend , lived with him , worked with him . Then the boy quite suddenly died . That was nearly fifteen years ago , and Halleck has not recovered to this day . Like Damon and Pythias . Jonathan and David . . . " We were outside in the street . Brusquely Halleck shook my hand ; hurried away . As Verplanck and Leggett argued politics , Irving turned to me . " I have not forgotten your interest in Colonel Burr . Would it amuse you to go and see Richmond Hill ? " I said that I would be most amused . Colonel Burr is at Albany and Mr. Craft can always do without me for an afternoon . I got into Irving 's open carriage . Leggett and the others waved good-bye and Leggett gave me a schoolboy 's wink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Feeling rather conspicuous , I sat back in the carriage . The great man at my side nodded to gentlemen , lifted his hat to ladies , as we jolted along Wall Street . " I have not seen Richmond Hill in twenty years . But I believe . . . Driver , stop ! Stop ! " lrving 's voice can be loud when he wants . The coachman pulled over to the side just as the carriage in front of oursp117disgorged the stout slow ermine-clad Mr. Astor , just returned from Europe to find his wife dead . He looks half-dead himself but , apparently , business goes on as usual . Irving leapt with singular grace from the carriage , leaving me to decide whether or not to follow or stay . I stayed . The two stood in the doorway of the Merchants ' Bank , heads together , a family of piglets racing around their legs . Mr. Astor is reputed to like literature , to help artists . According to Leggett , he also wants to be thought well of as he buys up our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be his secretary-companion and live with him at the Hell Gate mansion . Halleck 's job is to see that Mr. Astor is treated with respect in the newspapers . Interview done with , Irving returned to the carriage , moving slowly now , as befits a great and heavy man . " I need advice in financial matters . " He sat back in the seat , and sighed . " I am prone to speculation . Usually with disastrous results . Poor  --  no , rich Mr. Astor tries to be helpful . You know , he took over Richmond Hill , after Colonel Burr lost it . In fact , breaking up that estate into lots was the beginning of the Astor fortune in New York . It seems so simple , does n't it ? To make a fortune . " Irving talked a good deal about houses and property and money . I listened attentively , hardly able to believe that I was the sole auditor of this famous man who was recognised and waved at by several strangers in City Hall Park where a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But though I was somewhat disappointed by the material cast of Irving 's mind , he compensated by telling me a dozen stories aboutlandmarks present as well as gone . " This was where we used to hunt duck . " He pointed to a row of tenements . " Just past those houses begin  --  or began  --  the Lispenard Meadows . And beyond them was Richmond Hill . " As we were crossing an open stretch between buildings , Irving was suddenly agitated . " That 's it ! There ! Look . See that well ? " I saw nothing but an empty field . But Irving is able to people landscapes with his own imaginings . " It is the Manhattan Well ! In the early spring of eighteen hundred , one Elma Sands was found at the bottom of that well , murdered . " A slight colour rose in his cheeks . The small eyes gleamed . " A young Mr. Levi Weeks was accused of the murder . Ile claimed innocence of the murder but guilt of having enjoyed the favours of Elma Sands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two most brilliant lawyers of the day defended Weeks  --  Aaron Burr and Alexander I laniilton . I was in the court-nx ) m during Colonel Burr 's performance . liv the time he had finished , the jury and the judge  --  and nop118doubt the devil himself  --  were convinced that Elma Sands was a woman of no virtue while Levi Weeks was a young Galahad . " " Do you think this was true ? " I know the effect a good lawyer can make on a jury . The sun at noon can become the moon at midnight if Colonel Burr has decided that such a replacement is in the interest of his client . " Who knows ? But of course Weeks was let free . Then . . . " Irving turned toward me and I noticed tiny broken veins on his nose . He actually licked his lips with pleasure in recollection . " . . . as the judge , Burr and Hamilton were talking to one another outside the court-house , a relative of Elma Sands approached and said , You are eternally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have done to the memory of Elma Sands . ' Shortly afterward , the judge vanished from his hotel never to be seen again . Burr then killed Hamilton , and now lives on and on "  --  the voice was clear and soft , each syllable distinct  --  " under the dread mark of Cain . " It was most moving to hear an unwritten tale by Washington Irving . I must ask the Colonel if there is any truth to the story . The city has pretty much overwhelmed the Lispenard Meadows and most of the lands of Richmond Hill ( now bordered by Varick and Charlton streets ) . But the mansion itself still stands , somewhat altered since I was a child in Greenwich and used to play in the grounds , or what was left of them . Recently the hill beneath the mansion was removed ; the house is now at street level and no longer commands a view of the Hudson . It is simply a large old frame building with wings . A sign above the front door proclaims " Richmond Hill Theatre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , The Liberator of Rome , with Mr. Ingersoll . " Irving looked about him , at the new houses to left and right . He shook his head , mournfully . " I first set foot in this house when Colonel Burr was the vice-president . My brother Peter brought me . A third of a centuryago . With half-shut eyes , Irving stared at the front of the building ( no sign of life inside or out ) , as though he might through sheer force of imagination evoke the young Burr and his Little Band . So Irving must have looked when his genius summoned from the Alhambra the phantom Boabdil . I do like his kind of writing , no matter what Leggett says . There is not much magic in the world these days . Irving moved to the front door , rapped on it . No answer . I le opened the door and we went inside . A foyer had been achieved by blocking up a part of what had been the downstairs hall . ( ) n the walls play hills flourish on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone at the centre of the gutted mansion . The main hall has been turned into a pit with stage at the far end ; the curtain was up on some poorly painted scenery depicting a castle . Where the second-floor landing had been , boxes had been built in a semicircle . " That was the Blue Room . " Irving pointed to the theatre pit . " You know , Colonel Burr had the first Venetian blinds I ever saw . " He walked carefully among the rows of benches to what had been the Blue Room . " Oh ! " Triumph . He had found the outline of a sealed fireplace visible through whitewash . " That is where he was standing when my brother and I came in after dinner . " Irving became an awkward young man , moved uncertainly toward the whitewashed wall . I could almost see Aaron Burr , sleek and dark and elegant at the fireplace ( seegar in hand ? no , there would be ladies present ) . " Over there at a card table sat Vanderlyn , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met him when he was a starving boy at Kingston . Saw one of his pictures , told him all he needed to make his way in New York was a clean shirt . One day , in this very room , " Irving was embroidering freely but I was mesmerized , to think of old Vanderlyn as ever young and starving , " a servant brought the Colonel a package . He opened it . Inside was a rough but clean shirt . The boy had arrived . Burr paid for his training , sent him to Paris , got him commissions . At Colonel Burr 's insistence Vanderlyn painted a miniature of my mother which I still have . " Irving paused , looked down at the dirty floor . " I remember a red Turkey carpet . But not much furniture . Colonel Burr had been forced to sell most of his possessions just before he went to Washington City . He was always in debt . " Irving made a sweeping gesture . " Just think of all the remarkable men who have been in this room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boxes , the rows of benches . " During the Revolution , Washington . Then Adams lived here when he was vice-president . And the visitors ! Talleyrand , Jerome Bonaparte , King Louis Philippe . " Irving said the famous names like a witch casting a spell until I half-expected to see General Washington himself come out on the stage and sing " Yankee Doodle . " " I pinched myself that first evening  --  to think that I was here . " Irving moved to a sort of bay to the left of the fireplace . In it was a ladder and a bucket of whitewash turned to chalk . " She sat there . On a cabriole sofa , covered in velvet . " Irving approached the ladder on tiptoe . Smiled tenderly at the bucket of whitewash . " Theodosia , " he whispered . " Are you still here ? "  |p120But  Theodosia was long gone to her grave at the bottom of the sea and we were quite alone in the wreck of Richmond Hill , except for a drunken janitor who suddenly emerged from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Forgive us . " Irving was benign . " The door was open . I used to come here when it was a private house . " " This is a theatre , man , ca n't you read ? If you want to come in you can buy a ticket like the rest . " Suspiciously the man bore down upon us . Although Irving did his best to charm the janitor neither Aaron Burr nor Washington Irving was a familiar name to one who knew a pair of thieves when he saw them ; and saw them off the premises . Irving was full of talk all the way back into the city . Apparently there was never a person as marvellous as Theodosia . A scholar , a wit , a beauty , able to preside over her father 's table at the age of fourteen . I must say she sounds like the sort of girl I would run from . Yet everyone seems to have come under her spell . When Theodosia was ten or eleven her mother died , and she became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone else , I am certain of that . " Irving echoed Madame . All New York seems to be of the same mind  --  a Byronic theme if ever there was one . " The Colonel was devastated when she married Mr. Alston who took her to live in South Carolina  --  so far away . I think the last time they ever saw one another was at Richmond , Virginia , during his trial for treason . I confess he was superb then ! The hero of the whole affair . With Theodosia beside him like  --  like a consort ! And how all we young people paid court to them . " There was more in this vein . Also a second promise to find for me his account of the trial . Only by mentioning Leggett could I shift Irving 's conversation from the luminous past to the dull but to me vital present . " Such a sharp young man , Mr. Leggett . But learned . Very learned . Of course his politics are , well . . . " Irving gave his little hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think Leggett will oppose Mr. Van Buren . " " Two years is a long time in politics . " The dreamy magic voice was replaced by a practical if still ingratiating tone . One can see why Irving is admired not only by Van Buren but by General Jackson . " 1 am sure the Evening Post will eventually do its duty , are n't you ? " I was not certain ; spoke of political differences . Irving affected to know nothing of such matters other than the observation that " the Democratic interest is not apt to produce anyone else in the next two years . "  | " Colonel Burr speaks most highly of Mr. Van Buren . " " Does he ? " Irving looked at me with a sharpness that seemed to peel away clothes and flesh . Yet the half-smile never left his lips . " Oh , yes , " I said . " He regards him as  --  well , like a son . " I had said it . Irving continued to smile ; he was now counting the ribs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not . . . believe ' that story . " To my relief , Irving turned his gaze from me . " Mr. Van Buren 's mother was a most godly woman , and many years older than Colonel Burr . . . " " Who married a woman ten years older than he . " When in doubt attack . Irving showed displeasure . I was complimented . I had shaken that constant benevolent blandness . " I knew her , Mr. Schuyler , and know that she could not have  --  done what they say she did . " " Yet the Colonel took Mr. Van Buren into his office , helped him , promoted him . . . " Colonel Burr , as you know better than I , is a born pedagogue . He loves the young . He loves to teach them . After all he is the son and grandson of presidents of Princeton College . " I feared for a moment that Irving would again sink like some huge river animal into the swamp of the past and I would be told more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fortunately , sensing danger from me , he was to the point . " There is nothing more in character than for Colonel Burr to advance the career of a brilliant young man . " " When the Colonel came back from France , Mr. Van Buren let him stay at his house in Albany . " " Mr. Van Buren is a good and generous person , to a fault , some say . . " And Colonel Burr helped him with legislation for the Assembly . " For the moment I had forgotten just what it was that the Colonel had helped the young assemblyman to do but it was something significant . Irving was now alarmed . " The Colonel is an old man , given to  --  1 should think  --  exaggeration . " " No . He is always precise . He is still an excellent lawyer . He does not stray from facts . " I could not resist this thrust at the master of fancy himself . Irving parried the thrust . " When occasion warranted , Colonel Burr could be as free with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But since he speaks with admiration of Mr. Van Buren . . . " " My dear boy , there are those who wish to destroy Mr. Van Buren with any weapon . So why not love ? The kiss in the garden of Gethsemane . For years the Vice President 's enemies have put it aboutp122that he is Colonel Burr 's natural son , that he is Colonel Burr 's unnatural political creation . Both are lies . " I had stirred him at last . " If so , then , why did Mr. Van Buren meet the Colonel last summer . . . " " Here we are . Reade Street . " The carriage stopped . Irving pointed to the water-tower at the far end of the street . " Colonel Burr 's monument . You know , he founded the Manhattan Water Company in order to start , clandestinely , a bank . " " But we still have the water . " Irving laughed . " Yes , and the bankers have the Bank of Manhattan . I enjoyed our afternoon . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in old matters . " I thanked him at length for his kindness . He patted my knee . " Your investigation will lead you down all sorts of paths . You must be careful . There are pitfalls for the unwary . " Irving 's fingers again administered the same savage pinch as at our first meeting . The eyes that studied mine were clear , and hard . " I trust that no one will try to make anything of the casual friendship that once existed between the Colonel and the Vice-President . Because Mr. Van Buren is certain to be our next president , and he will remember his enemies every bit as vividly as he does his friends . " The warning  --  threat  --  was even more shocking to me than the pinch . As I got out of the carriage , Washington Irving was his usual shy , diffident self . " So happy  --  excursions elsewhere  --  oh , Knickerbocker , Knickerbocker ! " This evening when I undressed for bed , I saw on my thigh a dark bruise . I am convinced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true , and that the election could well depend on the Aaron Burr connection . FOR THREE DAYS there has been rioting in the streets . Certainly we are living through some sort of revolution . There has never been an election as bitter as this one.  |p123This  morning ( the third and last day of the election ) , Colonel Burr gave me some material to take to Matthew Davis . " It 's of no importance . " He tapped the folder in my hand . " Simply a ruse to find out what is happening . " Colonel Burr adjusted the muffler at his neck ( the office was hot ; the day warm ) . He is always excited at election time . " In my day it was so simple . Only a thousand men voted for governor . " " Not exactly democracy , was it ? " " No , it was not . In fact , New York state was the private property of three families . " He quoted . " The Clintons have power , the Livingstons have numbers , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over twenty-one can vote . It is quite astonishing . " Burr looked dreamily into the ashy grate . " None of us  --  not even Jefferson  --  foresaw this democracy . I suspect it will prove a bad thing . But the other was certainly worse , though Heaven knows convenient if one . . . " There was a sound of shouting just north of us , from Duane Street . " Go out ! Reconnoitre ! See the sans-culottes ! Tell Matt Davis my heart is with him , as always . But nothing more . Jackson is the best of all our presidents . . . for what that is worth . " In Duane Street I saw my first battle , and wondered if Monmouth Court House had been similar . All morning a procession of Whigs had carried through the town a miniature frigate labelled The Constitution which they finally set down outside the Masonic Hall . They then went inside the hall for a meeting . At about noon a mob of drunken Irish attacked the frigate but were driven off by the Whigs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angry Whigs ( a curious mixture of workies and wealthy merchants ) were milling about , examiningone another 's blackened eyes and broken heads while their frigate was slowly being pulled across the street into the safe harbour of New York Hospital 's front yard . I found Mr. Davis in front of the hall . With him was a portly man with a furious face . " Charlie Schuyler ! My fellow historian . " The glass in one of Mr. Davis 's steel-rimmed spectacles was shattered , making him look odd but happy . " Davis , I insist you call for the Mayor . " The portly man was edgy . " We need protection . " " Nonsense . A kw playful b'hoys , no more . Think nothing of it . " Mr. Davis looked at me . " The vote 's going our way , Charlie ! We 're winning the city , and-best of all  --  we 're going to elect Vcrplanck. "  |p124A  rock from nowhere landed at our feet . The portly man gasped . Mr. Davis ignored it . " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry Clay president two years from now . " On this prophetic note , we were engulfed by the democracy . Waving clubs , throwing paving stones , several thousand drunken savages from the Sixth Ward swept into Duane Street . A rock struck me in the shoulder . I fell back against the wall . A lout pummelled the portly man until Mr. Davis raised his walking-stick and with a splendid thwack broke the man 's nose . Then , gleefully , Davis aimed his stick at the crutch of a lad with a shillelagh . The boy doubled up , vomited beer , ceased to be with us in spirit . The elderly Mr. Davis was plainly in his element . I was not in mine . Ducking from side to side , I managed to get clear of the worst of the fighting just as His Honour Mayor Gideon Lee appeared with a number of armed watchmen . The Mayor stood very tall and stern at the head of his men . " Stop ! " he shouted . There was a sudden quiet as the invaders from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at hand . " This is your mayor . Disassemble . And go back to your houses . Peacefully . That is an order . " A well-aimed rock removed the Mayor 's tall hat . Sticks at the ready , the city watchmen moved upon the mob , and the mob charged . I ran as quickly as I could to the grounds of New York Hospital where I found Mr. Davis and the portly gentleman . " They are desperate , our friends at Tammany . " Mr. Davis was ravished by the disorder . " This "  --  he indicated the roaring battle all around us  --  " is the beginning of the end for Mr. Van Buren , and the making of Henry Clay . My boy , we have created a truly new party ! " I can not fathom Mr. Davis . Originally a leader of Tammany , originally a backer of Jackson , originally an ally of Van Buren , Mr. Davis split with all of them on the issue of the Bank ( he likes it ; they do n't ; why does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put together a new Whig party made up of the wealthiest people in the city , and the poorest . Two groups with nothing in common save support for Mr. Biddle 's Bank of the United States and a passion for Henry Clay . Yet why should the poor care about the Bank ? And why should the rich care about Henry Clay ? To me it is a perfect mystery . Respectfully , we stood aside as two watchmen carried the unconscious mayor of New York into the hospital , a dented top-hat resting on the proud curve of his stomach.  | " Let us go some place less turbulent . " Pleased despite the beating the Whigs were taking , Mr. Davis led us to the seedy Broadway House whose large bar-room is the unofficial centre of the Whig party . Mr. Davis established his headquarters in a far corner of the noisy crowded smoky room . Nearly everyone was drunk ; the price of a vote , in fact , is beery oblivion after the vote is cast . A dark man , not in the least drunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the lot of them in the Fourth Ward . " " No one hurt ? " " No one dead . " As the man moved to go , his coat swung open and I saw both a knife and a knobbed stick stuck in his belt . The portly man was not pleased . " We must not resort to their tac-tics . " " We must protect ourselves . " Tea was brought Mr. Davis and beer for me and for the portly man who turned out to be the notorious Mordecai Noah . Ten years ago he was the first  --  and only  --  Jew ever to be appointed sheriff of New York . When there was criticism of a Jew being put in a position where he might hang Christians , Noah is supposed to have said , " Pretty Christians to require hanging at all ! " Noah is a remarkable creature who writes melodramas for the stage , edits newspapers , and serves  --  or used to serve  --  Tammany as one of its leaders . President Madison made him consul at Tunis ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pirates ) ; and President Jackson appointed him surveyor of the port of New York , a post he recently resigned when he broke with the President over the Bank . Until the last election he was co-editor of the Courier and Enquirer , a newspaper favourable to Jackson until Mr. Biddle 's Bank became an issue . Then Noah and his newspaper turned around completely and began to attack the Administration . During the election it was discovered that Noah and his fellow editor were secretly taking money from Mr. Biddle . This scandal was helpful to the Administration ; harmful to Mr. Biddle , the corruptor of the press . At the moment Noah edits the Evening Star which openly supports the Bank and the Whig interest . After a lifetime of loyalty to Tammany and the workies , Noah is now devoted to the rich Mr. Biddle and to his creature Henry Clay . Leggett thinks Noah mad . " But colourful . A compulsive actor . And of course he 's the king of the Jews , or thinks he is . " Leggett described how Noah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possession " of Grand Island in the Niagara River and there proclaimed the City of Ararat , to bep126home of refuge for the Jews . Needless to say , the city fathers of Buffalo uickly put a stop to that . This afternoon Noah was not very kingly  --  simply nervous and omplaining . " How stupid it was of those employers to shut down their businesses and order their workers to vote Whig . " " Do n't fret , Mordecai . The tide that will soon bring us in will carry out our Nestorian skipper . " Mr. Davis turned to me as though to allay any possible shock on my part . " Whom we applaud . What good democrat does not ? But we recognise that the President has grown old serving the people and now  --  poor old man  --  he listens to Van Buren and to the other enemies of the people . Oh , there will be changes soon ! " I can not for the life of me understand why men like Davis and Noah care so much about the election or rejection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alderman in the First Ward or president in the White House . But then that is not the point . For the true and effective partisan who supported Jackson in ' 28 or ' 3 z there was bound to be money or office or both . Currently half of Tammany Hall are now directors of those new banks that came into existence after Jackson struck at Nicholas Biddle and the Bank of the United States . Incidentally , no one  --  not even Leggetthasyet made clear why the federally supervised Bank is so much worse than a thousand banks that are unsupervised . Yet for some mysterious reason the Bank is thought " aristocratic " while the banks are " democratic . " The poor of course are as certain to be fleeced by the many as they were by the one . " I am not confident . Not confident at all ! " There was an explosion Lear by . The windows of the bar-room rattled . " Exactly what we want ! Let Tammany take the credit for burning the city ! " Mr. Davis was euphoric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . righting and plundering and arson have erupted all over the city . " Now what has Colonel Burr sent me ? " Mr. Davis opened the folder . For the first time Noah was aware of my presence ; asked me if I was indeed a messenger from Aaron Burr . " Not only a messenger , " Mr. Davis spoke for me , " but he is also composing a life of that much maligned man . " " I come to appreciate Burr more and more . " Noah was suddenly alert . What do you know of his business out west ? " Again Mr. Davis answered for both of us . " We know  --  I thinkwerything , and the Colonel was innocent of all charges . " " Of course . But what about the involvement of President Jack-son ? " " It was no greater . . . " In the best court r*xxn manner I decided top127move to the sort of offence that stops entirely the prosecution 's manoeuvre . " . . . than the involvement of Henry Clay . " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books being rubbed together . " He 's got you there , Mordecai . " Noah was not distressed . " Clay only defended Burr in court . Nothing more . But Jackson was ready to go to Mexico with him . Everyone knows that . " " Everyone except his two biographers . No , Mordecai . That line of attack will do us no good . Andrew Jackson is too beloved to treat in such a manner . Besides , he 'll be gone in two years ' time ; if not sooner . " " That would not stop me from telling the people what they ought to know about the sort of man who . . . Davis , do you see what I see ? " So Edmund Kean looked when he saw Banquo 's ghost at the Park Theatre . A tall smiling man had entered the bar-room . Although clean , he was dressed like a labourer . Mr. Davis lost his usual composure . " Let us look the other way , " he announced too late , for the man , blinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , came to our table . Glumly , Mr. Davis introduced me to Thomas Skidmore . Five years ago Leggett lent me Skidmore 's pamphlet " The Rights of Man to Property ! " but I never read it . In those days Skidmore was considered to be the anti-Christ  --  no , worse , the anti-property ! A self-taught machinist , Skidmore argued ( brilliantly but wildly , according CO Leggett ) in favour of putting an end to imprisonment for debt , an end to private ownership of land , an end to all inherited wealth . He even favoured the taxing of churches  --  and just about every other measure the mind of a crank could conceive if he wants really to be hated in our city . Leggett finally attacked him as the apostle of a system of " public robbery . " Nevertheless , for a single season Skidmore had been the hero of the workies , and the terror of the property owners . " We shall win the city . " Mr. Davis was polite but cool . Noah was neither . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without destroying society . " " But that makes no sense , Mr. Noah . No sense at all . " The mild whiny voice contrasted with the blunt words . " Until we give to each man his due there is not a society here but a tyranny of the few . " " That is what the Tammany men say in the Sixth Ward . " " But , Mr. Noah , they do n't mean what they say and we do . " We , Mr. Skidmore ? " Noah was most unpleasant . But Skidmore was serene . " An idea so basic as true equality , Mr. Noah , can not he the sole possession of ' a single mind , no matter how radical . "  |p128With  a pleasant nod , Skidmore moved on to a table of low types , swilling beer . As he sat down , he suddenly said in a loud voice , " Mr. Davis , the Whig party will fail . Because the others have more than you . " " What did that mean ? " Noah turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Davis shrugged . " He is a bad man . " Having listened so much to Leggett , I made the obvious answer . " He means that if you are going to have a world with a few people rich and a good many poor then the party with more rich people than the other will win . For the first time Noah did me the honour of listening . " He 's right . " He spoke to Mr. Davis as if I was not there . " Charlie is a clever boy . " " Then why is he working for Colonel Burr ? " " Why indeed ? " Mr. Davis gave me the Tammany look which means " nothing is what it seems . " " I admire him , as a lawyer . " I was defensive , and ought not to be . " Charlie is onto something golden . " Mr. Davis sounded as if he had just bought a judge 's decision . " He will write the true story of Colonel Burr while I shall write the official memoirs . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are to be in competition , Matthew L. Davis and I ? I am suspicious . Noah showed interest . " You have arranged for publication ? " " Yes . " Mr. Davis answered for me . " Charlie is dealing with William Leggett . " I was startled . How did Mr. Davis know ? " But I am not writing for theEvening Post . . . " " Leggett ! " Noah proceeded at length to accuse Leggett of every crime . Then , " Thank God , Webb beat him to the ground ! In the street ! With a cane ! " I said that it was Leggett who had beaten Webb . We were interrupted by a clatter of horses in the street , the jangle of armour , a shout : " It 's the militia ! " " Let us hope they get to the ballot-boxes before our friends at Tammany do . " For the first time Mr. Davis showed some anxiety . Certainly he showed none at all a few moments later when a rock broke through the window just above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rather delicately jostling my beer mug as it rolled to the floor . Noah and I both leapt to our feet . Not Mr. Davis . Coolly he combed the glass shards from his thin gray hair . A red face poked through the hole in the window and bellowed , " There they are , the . . . " We never heard just what we were , for Mr. Davis in a swift gesturep129raised his cane and cracked smartly the red face . " Out , you whoreson ! " rang the voice of Tammany 's one-time Grand Sachem . The red face was seen no more . The bar-room broke into cheers . Mr. Davis accepted the homage of his people with a gracious , thin-lipped smile . " Quite like the old days ! " he said to me . " When Burr and Hamilton were dividing the people . I confess to nostalgia . " " You 're mad ! They 'll burn the city now ! They 're capable of anything if they think they 're losing the election . " Noah was trembling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fragments of window glass into a neat pile . Then he put Burr 's message into his coat pocket ; turned to me . " The Colonel thinks I should give you any notes I might have . " " I do n't want you to give me anything if you really believe that I intend to . . . " " Charlie , Charlie ! Whatever you want to read you can . I shall send you what I have . " Mr. Davis was now on his feet . " Try to publish as soon as you can . I thanked Mr. Davis . He is remarkably kind . But then he can not publish his own book for several years at least and perhaps he thinks my effort will whet the public 's appetite for the entire story . My effort ? What am I writing about ? I now act even to myself as if I were writing the full story of the Colonel 's life when , actually , I am only on the track of one small portion of it which Leggett assures me will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be if the president is Clay rather than Van Buren . Also , do I want to be the key that opens such a door ? Odd situation to be in for someone who dislikes politics and politicians . It is my secret dream to live in Spain or Italy and write stories like Washington Irving . I am counting on this work to bring me the money to travel . I only hope that the Colonel is dead when I publish . No . I can not hope or want that . But I must publish within the next year and a half . Before the presidential election . It is a hard business I have got myself into.  |p130VERPLANCK  WAS DEFEATED for mayor by 179 votes out of some 5,000 cast . Tammany Hall is victorious but shaken , for the Whigs have taken the city 's common council . Mr. Davis must be happy . ColonelBurr is happy  --  no , amused . " It 's the new people , Charlie . They 're going to take it all one of these days . " " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Poor Matt ! He lacks judgement in the big things but is a master of the small . Van Buren will be nominated and he will defeat Clay or any other National Republican  --  no , no , Whig , I must get used to calling them that . How topsy-turvy it is ! Those of us who were for the Revolution were Whigs . Those for Britain were Tories . Then there was the fight over the federal Constitution . In our state Governor Clinton wanted a weak federal government . So some of the Whigs became anti-Federalist , and some like Hamilton became Federalist . Then the Tory-Federalists became Republican . Now **27;55;TOOLONG call themselves Whig though they are anti-Whig while the anti-Federalist Republicans are now Jacksonian Democrats . Oh , names are magic here ! " " What were you , after the Revolution ? " " Neutral . I inclined to the anti-Federalists , but I took no part in the long debate . I do recall my first reading of the Constitution . It will not last fifty years , ' I said . Obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am right in principle . The Constitution is much too brittle a document for a country like ours . By the way , I saw a dead man on West Street when I got off the boat this morning . He was killed last night at the polling-place , and no one has thought to take away the corpse . Thy hand great Anarch lets the curtain fall and universal darkness buries all . ' " I know the quotation by heart because Burr so often quotes it . " Do you favour Van Buren ? " I asked . A single drop of sweat trickled down the centre of my spine . It is a warm day . " Yes , I do . " " Because of your old connection ? " The eyes were shut now ; small feet on the edge of the grate . " I am old and therefore moderate . The only old man I know who loves danger and surprise is Andrew Jackson . But then I think there must be a medical explanation . Too much blood in the brain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things . He is without ferocity , while Clay is unstable and corrupt . "  | " Does Mr. Davis know you prefer Van Buren ? " " Oh , yes . He pays no attention to me . He knows that Aaron Burr  --  what 's left of him  --  is not a Burrite . " THE CITY IS A WRECK from the rioting . In some streets every window isbroken . But who cares ? The day is beautiful , the militia have been withdrawn , the Irish are sick with sore heads , and I go with Helen Jewett to the Vauxhall Gardens . We took a coach up the Bowery to the point where it meets Broadway . Helen was like a child . Since she joined Mrs. Townsend 's establishment she has never been beyond a block or two of Thomas Street . She wore a high-necked dress , and looked as much a lady as ever drank tea in the Ladies Dining Room of the City Hotel . " Oh , it took me hours and hours to convince her that 1 did have an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of our guests knew her and told me that she often wondered where I was and so I said , Mrs. Townsend , I must tell my aunt I 'm alive and well because suppose she asks the police about me ? ' " Helen has a smile like an isosceles triangle long side down . " So she let me off for the day , very put out she was , too , and told me that God punished liars . Do you think this is true ? " I said I doubted it . But assured her that if there is a Hell , it would one day include a marvellously learned lady , able to drive Satan mad with scripture and theology . The evening was warm and the gardens crowded with couples . No one seemed aware that we are living through what Leggett terms a revolution . After a promenade beneath coloured lanterns , dutifully breathing in and out the country air , scented with hyacinth , we found ourselves in a bower close enough to the band to hear the music but not so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A Negro waiter brought us vanilla ice-cream and cake . I have never been so nervous , and I can not think why . Helen was not at all what I expected  --  or she expected ? At first she hadp132been like a dog unchained from a gate . She could not get enough of the sights and the sounds the rest of us take for granted . The Gingerbread Man on Broadway particularly intrigued her as he ran by , coat-tails streaming in the wind , pockets bulging with gingerbread , his only food . No one knows who he is or where he lives because he never speaks , just runs , eats gingerbread , sips water at the public pumps . By the time we were seated in the bower , listening to the band play marches , Helen had grown very quiet , even sullen . " What 's the good of coming out like this when 1 must go back to-night ? " I suppose from the beginning I knew what I was doing . It was not possible to show freedom to that unchained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the gate . Was I deliberately cruel in showing her this much of the world beyond her room in Thomas Street ? Or simply stupid ? Both , I suppose . " I thought you  --  well , did n't dislike it , where you are . " " I hate it . " She crumbled cake disagreeably . I hoped I would not have to touch her hand and feel the stickiness of sugar . Once I got honey on my neck as a child . My mother said that I screamed for an hour . " There is never hot water . " Helen frowned . " The Negro woman does n't like me . The others get hot water twice a day . Most days I get this barely warm water , only once . And in the winter it 's ice cold . I tell Mrs. Townsend this is no way to live . She speaks to me of moral courage and promises to tell the Negro woman but it 's the same thing the next day , and the woman  --  she just smiles at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just smiles and looks happy and shoves the tin at me , slopping water on the floor . " Helen swept the fragments of the cake onto the ground . " You see ? I have nothing to talk to you about . " I told her I liked her whether or not she talked . I was sincere . She was indifferent . The evening was going all wrong . " What do you talk to the others about ? " Helen shrugged . " Everything . Nothing . We talk about the customers . They say shocking things  --  the girls . " " Such as ? " " Shocking , I said . " She would not indulge me . What , I wonder , do they say of me ? " Then we talk about clothes , and I like that best . I sew for them . I like sewing . Do people come here every night ? " She looked about her , eyes dazzled by the pink and yellow of lanterns . The music was slow now ; a single fiddle played a mournful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hyacinths , coloured lights , the half shadowed sullen pretty face of a prisoner made free fin- a single evening by inc . It was like a fairy-talc , particularly the ending when she must return atp133midnight to Thomas Street and its guardian witch Rosanna Townsend , nevermore free again . Though why should I not set her free permanently ? I could , with some effort , rent a room for her . And she could earn money by sewing . I proposed the matter to her . Helen smiled at last , looked happy . " Oh , good ! " I was alarmed . It is one thing to talk like this during a fiddler 's off-key aria , and another to wake up in the morning and find another person lying beside you forever , and no more choice . Either Helen sensed my fear or she is truly unusual . " But that would be wrong . I could never live with a man 1 was n't married to . " This was breath-taking but she meant it . " I 'm not like that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Townsend 's ? " " That 's different . " Helen was firm . " ; You would n't want to marry me , would you ? " She laughed before I could think of anything to say . " No , you would n't . Besides , I 'd be a bad wife . I 'm not good with children . They frighten me . That 's why living at Mrs. Townsend 's is really not bad , most of the time . If there were a different maid . . . " The face became heavy with resentment , an ugly expression which made her all the more appealing to me . " But you will remember to find me work where I can be paid as much as I get now and start a business of my own , though where I shall get a hundred dollars I do n't know . I try to save but it all goes . I do n't know where . My mother said I would die in the poorhouse which is where she is , poor thing . " " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not heard by me since one of Mrs. Townsend 's customers vaulted the back fence and landed in the neighbour 's piggery . " What about my father ? You tell me . I never knew him . Neither did my mother , I should think . She drank a lot when she was young , and worked as a dress-maker . Only cutting  --  which is all she did  --  not really sewing . 11er eyes were too weak . She lacked the touch . You can tell me about your people , if you like . " At last a personal exchange ; the first in our seventeen encounters . I keep count , being on a strict budget . " My father kept a bar in Greenwich Village . My mother worked there , too . I suppose he 's as much a drunkard as your mother . " " They were rich . " A long sigh . " No . But the bar did well . " " Brothers , sisters ? " " A II dead . Five , I think , there were . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hut must 've been hard on your mother . " " It was . She hated my father . I hat was harder still . " I told I Helenp134everything  --  or almost everything . She listened like a child being read a story . Ever since I was born there had been quarrels between my father and mother . He drunk , abusive ; she tearful , frightened . One November night he locked her out of the house . Too proud to go to a neighbour 's , she slept in the shed at the back , got a chill , a fever , a pleurisy , a coffin and a grave . Since I was living in the city , going to classes at Columbia College , I did not know for a week that she was dead . " When I came home , we fought in the yard , my father and I. I bloodied him . And to this day I 've not set foot in Greenwich . " Telling this story , I felt strong , masterful , a king out of legend ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not mention that my father nearly put out one of my eyes with a stool . " You 've never seen him since ? " There was  --  I shivered with pleasure  --  awe in her voice . " Recently . In the street . We were polite . " Murderer , murderer , murderer , a drum beats in my head when I think of him , write of him , look at the miniature of my mother , painted on ivory by Vanderlyn  --  she was a pretty woman , never happy . Together Helen and I strolled through the gardens and Helen took careful note of every dress . " See those mutton sleeves ? They took days and days to sew ! And the material ! French watered silk . And look at that fichu ! Belgian lace . " She gave me a carefully detailed report on the cut and cost of every lady 's clothes . As we rounded a small pavilion , we nearly stepped into a pair of figures  --  who leapt apart . One was William de la Touche Clancey . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got up to resemble a swell ; only the red blunt hands betrayed the fact that he was a workie . " So ! " Clancey gave his accusing goose-like hiss . The boy looked embarrassed , as well he should . There are some things that the poor ought not to do even for money . " So how is your friend the radical Mr. Leggett ? " Yes , Clancey remembered me from the Five Points . " Very well . And how is your friend Mr. Edwin Forrest ? " I was bland . " I 've seen you before , Miss . " The boy looked at Helen who stared at him with a blankness that would have done credit to an Assembly matron . " I work for Joseph Hoxie , Miss . You must know him . He 's a friend of Mrs. Townsend . " Helen did not blink . " I think , " she said to me , " it 's time to meet our friends . " But Clancey was eager to balance an account . Townsend ? Town/send ? Surely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Park ? " " No , Mr. Clancey . The lady we know lives in Thomas Street . " The boy was obviously set on preparing a defence for himself if Helen was ever tempted to put it about that he , too , was a prostitute . " I fear that I know not a soul in that colourful part of town , except for my old friend the estimable Mr. Hoxie for whom young Richard works . " " Part-time ? " I could not resist the final thrust . In the lamplight the boy 's face went dark with rage . " I did not hear your name . . . " began Clancey to Helen but by then we were gone . To my surprise , Helen began to laugh . " I ca n't wait to tell the others . Do let 's get a carriage . Quickly ! I always suspected something was wrong with Mr. Hoxie . Now I know . Those handsome apprentices ! And it 's true , what the boy said , I have seen him before . Sometimes he stops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I guess he has n't the money or the courage to come inside or  --  or he does n't want to , that 's it ! To come in and visit us . Oh , what a day ! You are sweet , Charlie ! " She kissed my cheek like a sister . I was shocked by her response . Although I have spent many pleasant hours in establishments like Mrs. Townsend 's , I must , at heart , be very innocent or perhaps simple is the word . There is so much going on that I know nothing of . This was not the magic sad ending I had in mind for our evening . I HAVE READ several hundred pages of M. L. Davis 's memoirs of Aaron Burr and have learned almost nothing that I did not know . He might have outlined the material as follows : After the British left New York City , the Tory lawyers were disbarred , leaving an opening for Whig lawyers , particularly heroes of the Revolution . But the rule in New York state is that one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bar . Burr was in a hurry . He went to Albany , presented himself to the three justices of the state supreme court , got them to bend the rule for him ( particularly helpful was Justice Robert Yates ) and on January 19 , 1782 , he was admitted to the bar . Among his first clients were his old commander , Colonel Malcolm , the dePeysters of Albany , and Robert Livingston . April 12 , 1782 , he became a counsellor-at-law . July 6 , 1782 , he married Theodosia Prevost at Paramus , New Jersey . He was twenty-six . She was thirty-six . June 21 , 1783 , their daughter Theodosia was born at Albany . In November the Burrs moved to New York City , arriving just as the British army departed . The Burrs lived first at the Verplanck house two doors from City Hall . Then they moved to the corner of Maiden Lane and Nassau Street ( their back yard was famous for its grape-vines and arbours , their household for a drunken maid named Hannah ) . In 1791 they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Colonel took a lease on the mansion at Richmond Hill . From the beginning Colonel Burr was a successful lawyer . With his first partner , William T. Broome , he began to make and spend the first of several fortunes . As a lawyer he was  --  is  --  meticulous . Yet he has a certain contempt for the whole business . " The law , " he likes to say , " is simply whatever is boldly asserted and plausibly maintained . " Burr 's rivalry with Hamilton began in those days . It was inevitable . Both were heroes , both were ambitious , both were lawyers . Of the two Hamilton was considered to be the more profound philosophically as well as the more long-winded , with a tendency to undo his own brief by taking it past the point of successful advocacy . Burr was the more effective in a court-room because his mind was swifter than Hamilton 's ; also , of an entire generation of public men , Burr was free of cant : he never moralized unless to demonstrate a paradox . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground that the man who refuses to preach Goodness must be Bad . Yet juries are often grateful to the Colonel for not preaching at them . Neither Burr nor Hamilton was a natural orator like Clay or Webster . They could not move multitudes ; on the other hand , they were effective with juries and with their peers . Despite their rivalry , Burr and Hamilton sometimes worked together . On one case , the vain and edgy I Iamilton insisted that Burr precede him and give the first argument . Without protest , Burr rook the inferior position . Then , blandly , he used all the arguments that he knew I Iamiltonp137was going to make . Hamilton was furious and uncharacteristically shortand to the point when it came time for him to speak . These are the facts for those years and Mr. Davis simply puts them all down , pasting an occasional platitude over the Colonel 's wax-like effigy . I have just sent him back the manuscript with a grateful letter . Now I must begin the real work : finding out what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my purpose . One important derail from the Davis manuscript . He reproduces a letter Colonel Burr wrote from the Columbia county estate of the Van Ness family . The text of the letter ( to a Colonel Claypoole ) is of no particular interest . But the date and the place are vital . The Van Ness house in which Burr was staying is only a few miles from Kinderhook where Martin Van Buren was born December 5 , 1 782 . The date of the letter is March i 1 , 1782 . ( Yes , I have ticked off the months on my fingers . ) Burr 's last line is cryptic . " I disport myself as best I can in this wooded valley , and you know what I mean by that . " LEGGETT TOLD ME the latest Van Buren story . One senator betanother senator that he could get Van Buren to commit himself publicly on a public issue . " Matt , " said the senator , " there 's been some talk that the sun rises in the east . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same rumour , Senator , but since I never get up until after dawn , I have no useful opinion in the matter . "  |p138COLONEL  BURR and I watched with child-like pleasure the demolitionof a whole block of houses on Broadway just across from the Park Theatre . We were not alone . What looked to be half the town had turned out to watch as a huge iron ball attached to a crane smashed in the wall of the first house . Mr. Astor intends to build on the site a hotel that will eclipse the City Hotel . No doubt he will succeed . He always does . " Splendid ! " The Colonel clapped his hands as the narrow Dutch building buckled in upon itself with a hollow cascading sound . But then as a thick cloud of gray dust slowly began to rise , the audience fled . The Colonel and I crossed to the City Hall Park . Although we had an appointment at the Register 's Office , the Colonel was in no mood for work . Instead we sat on a bench beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the well-kept park . " This used to be called the Fields . " He pointed to a high place on a line with the City Hall . " And over there were the gallows . But not just an ordinary commonplace gallows . Oh , no ! New Yorkers have always liked their pleasures exotic . So our gallows was designed to resemble a Chinese pagoda . Very pretty it was , too . And what a lot of poor wretches they used to hang there . In the first year of the federal government , when New York was the capital , there were five hangings in a single afternoon , one right after the other . The town was thrilled . President Washington was no doubt impressed . " " Were there as many murderers then as now ? " " Murderers ? Hardly ! We hanged only burglars in those days . Murder was practically unknown . " " There is so much I 'd like to know about that time . " " Yes , I know you would . " With a stick , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet . Emblems of his Mexican empire ? " I 've read some of Mr. Davis 's book . " " Do n't tell me. " " 1 wo n't . " " Must I do it myself ? " " I see no choice . " The Colonel gave a soft moan . " You know , Charlie , I made a great error  --  that is , of the many great errors I have made in my life , the worst was supposing that one could not be hurt by a lie . As a result , I never corrected a slander . I simply assumed that since there were so manyp139honourable men in the world who knew my character , matters would be set straight in time . Well , I was wrong . Friends drop away , die . While the slanders never cease , never ! " Burr spoke with a stoic wonder . No bitterness that I could detect . " When my daughter was alive , I was intent upon clearing my name for her , for my grandson . Then . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  no , water-side. " . . . for a good many years I have been perfectly indifferent . But now your interest . . . " He looked at me ( he must know ! ) and smiled . " Well , I do enjoy teaching though I would prefer a subject other than my career , despite its cautionary aspects . Very well . We shall talk and you may write down , if it amuses you , what I say in your short hand , which is so much more dextrous than my long . " Thus it was agreed . I have now begun to drive the Colonel a bit hard but there is not much time to assemble all the details . Leggett wants the Van Buren connection made explicit , with as much documentation as possible for an anonymous pamphlet . Later , under my own name , I will write the whole life , anticipating Mr. Davis . A prospect that excites me though Leggett is full of foreboding . " You will be favourable to Burr , and so must fail because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this is the greatest country on earth , Washington the greatest man that ever lived , Burr the wickedest , and evidence to the contrary is not admissible . That means no inconvenient facts , no new information . If you really want the reader 's attention , you must flatter him . Make his prejudices your own . Tell him things he already knows . He will love your soundness . " " Then explain your success at the Evening Post . Every day you attack your advertisers ' prejudices . . . " " And every day we lose another advertiser because of what Bryant calls my fierceness . I am also in constant danger of a knife in the ribs . Be warned by my success . ' " I shall be . IT TOOK THE COLONEL and me several days to learn how to work together . I le is not used to dictation ; he also refuses to rely on memory . " After all , I am a lawyer . Therefore I need evidence  --  books , letters , newspapers : things I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Colonel could not connect episodes . He tended to wander from the point . But now ( the middle of May ) we are working well and what began as a series of random anecdotes is becoming such a full narrative that as we sweep down the years I am at last able to detect , here and there , a glimpse of my quarry , and I am certain now that once I have thoroughly mapped the jungle it ought not to be too difficult to find whatever beast I want , no matter how hidden the lair ! THE COLONEL is unusually nervous today . " I feel like an actor whodoes not know his lines . " He has been sitting with a packet of letters and some old newspaper cuttings on the table in front of him . Also , an open much-marked copy of The Life of Alexander Hamilton , recently published by Hamilton 's son , John . " For once , Charlie , I wish that I had sired a proper son . There is a good deal to be said for filial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assume that any son of mine would write better than this boy who sounds like a combination of his father at his most windy , and his grandfather Schuyler at his most confused . Well , I shall be my own son  --  with your help . " The Colonel puts his feet up on the grate ; shuts his eyes as if he expects some inner curtain to rise upon past spectacles . " You asked me about Hamilton . " I had asked him about Van Buren . " Let me recall a scene or two for you . " He closes his throat . " It is November . . . " The eyes open for a moment and he glances at a newspaper cutting . " November 25 , 1783 . I have just come to New York City from Albany , with my wife and daughter . The American states have made peace with England . The British are about to depart . General Washington is to make his triumphant entry into the city . "  |p141I  record now the Colonel 's recollections  --  not as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a number of revisions in his own hand . Memoirs of Aaron Burr  --  OneAT ABOUT NOON , I arrived with my wife Theodosia at Cape 's Tavern in the Broad Way . The streets were filled with veterans , many drunk , all happy . New York City was a small place in those days but the people , despite a certain Dutchness , were as lively then as now . The assembly-room of the tavern was crowded with former officers wearing cockades of black and white , as well as sprigs of laurel to attest to our gallantry and patriotism . I knew most of the officers , though not their wives . I particularly recall General McDougall ; between the stammer and the Scots burr he was quite incoherent with joy . Theodosia hung back , intimidated by so many strangers . But then Elizabeth Hamilton took her firmly by the hand , in that effective Schuyler way , and presented her to various ladies . Elizabeth was uncommonly handsome as a girl , if too square-jawed . I have been told that Hamilton used to discuss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have had a good deal to talk about . My old friend Troup greeted me ; he was now a lawyer like me ( after two weeks in the city I had more business than I could handle ) . " A great day ! " we both agreed and of course it was , despite the fact that the war had been over for some time . Today 's ceremony was a tribute to the dilatoriness of Sir Guy Carleton , the British commander in New York . He kept finding excuses not to go home : the weather was bad , the ships in disrepair , His Excellency indisposed . But now it was finally ended . As we waited in the tavern , Sir Guy 's troops were slowly embarking from the Battery . At last General Washington could make his " triumphal " entry into the city that he had lost to the British seven years earlier and never , by arms , regained . Hamilton hurried into the long room , cheeks bright with excitement . 1 le greeted Troup and me warmly . Though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town , we were all of us friends that day . What a vivid , bright , pretty little man Hamilton was ! And oh , what a gift he had for making a moral point while destroying the reputation of an adversary . The malice in him was as spontaneous as the brilliance . " He 's in Chatham Street , at the Ica Water Pump ! " We knew who he was . Governor Clinton will escort him here . "  |p142We  congratulated one another on our good luck in so soon having the glorious Washington amongst us . But human pageantry is peculiarly vulnerable to the ridiculous . The only time I saw the Emperor Napoleon he was proceeding up the marble stairs of a Paris theatre , moving with all that sombre elegance he had learned from the actor Talma . But then , at the very top of the stairs , as all of us bowed reverently , he shrilly broke wind . Today 's comedy had been prepared by two British soldiers who had slyly greased the flag pole on the Battery . When our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flag and attendant dropped in a heap to the ground , deeply mortifying General Washington . Colonel ( now Brevet-General ) Malcolm joined us . Like so many senior officers who have not seen combat , this good man wanted to discuss the war . But the young men  --  and Hamilton , Troup and I thought we had invented youth  --  spoke only of the present and the future . I twitted Hamilton . " How are your rich and well-born friends ? " Hamilton was representing half the wealthy Tories in New York . " They suffer , too . " " I wish they would suffer me . " Troup wanted clients . " I shall send you an occasional rich widow . " Hamilton 's passion for the rich and the well-born was , doubtless , the result of having been born poor and illegitimate . Although the Constitution and the federal government would not be invented for another five years , the division in our ruling class was already apparent . The Tories who had opposed the Revolution now had no choice but to accept a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ king was no longer installed on the Battery , the principles of British government were still very much installed in their minds . They believed that we must have a government in which the privileges of the rulers are as well-defined as are the obligations of the ruled . In other words , we must re-create the British system . Hamilton was so devoted to all things English that if I had been he , I would have set sail for England that afternoon with Sir Guy , gone into British politics , and become prime minister . But Hamilton chose to stay and fight not only the pernicious idea of democracy but the craftiest of all its proponents , Thomas Jefferson  --  soon to be American minister at Paris , a post to which the Congress hustled him in the wake of his disastrous governorship of Virginia . The noise of cheering caused us to hurry to the windows . Washington the demigod  --  no , the god !  --  was dismounting . The crowd waved their hats . He raised his hat once and put it under his arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tavern . Incidentally , when Washington became president he wanted to be styled His Mightiness . The Senate was agreeable . The House of Representatives was not , and referred the other house to the Constitution which speaks of the chief executive as , simply , the president . In fact , the Speaker  --  the droll Mr. Muhlenberg  --  went so far as to suggest that perhaps the General would like to be known as " His High and Mightiness . " Muhlenberg 's mild pleasantry was not well received by the greatest man in the world who would very much have enjoyed , I suspect , being king had he not lacked a son , a prince of Virginia , to succeed him . But that was in the future . At the moment it was quite enough that the most famous man on earth was in the assembly-room of Cape 's Tavern . We formed two lines . Washington walked slowly between the rows , turning from side to side , his cold slow gaze mitigated by a hesitant almost boyish smile when he chose to favour a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was standing next to me . Suddenly the General looked positively merry , even animated ; for an instant his face like a dull mirror reflected the bright intelligence of the other 's image . " My boy . " He was like a father . " It is your day , General . Your country . " " Our day , Sir . " Then the light went from his face as he turned to me and saw himself in a very different sort of mirror . " Colonel Burr . You are recovered in your health , I trust ? " I said that I was and presented to him his old friend , my new wife . Theodosia curtsied , as to the King . Washington smiled and lifted her up . " Colonel Burr like the rest of us is . . . " Words , as usual , failed him . I was embarrassed . Theodosia looked pale . Hamilton did the work Heaven had designed for him . " Bewitched by the mistress of the Hermitage . " " Just so . " Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , flick of his bright blue eyes . What did he really think of Washington ? We come to that.  |p144COLONEL  BURR IS NOW delighted with our sessions , particularly when he re-reads his dictation and makes changes . " It is like preparing a brief  --  for the defence , of course ! " He is still reading and annotating his copy of The Life of Alexander Hamilton . The ancient rivalry is much on his mind . " You know , my friend Hamilton thought me equivocal ' on the subject of the Constitution . For once in describing me he used the exact word . I was  --  I am equivocal . I have told you I did not think the Constitution in its original form would last fifty years . Nor has it . The habit of amendment continues to alter its nature  --  though not enough . " He opened a volume of Hamilton 's works ; riffled the pages . " No one can say that the Constitution was framed by innocent men . They were  --  and I knew most of them  --  as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his rightful place on the gallows . They were most cynical . Listen to Hamilton . " Burr read : " Men will pursue their interests . It is as easy to change human nature as to oppose the strong current of selfish passions . A wise legislator will gently divert the channel , and direct it , if possible , to the public good . ' I like the if possible . ' What does the wise legislator do if it is not possible ? Feather his nest , I fear . " The Colonel laughed suddenly , and recalled " the time Hamilton made an election speech to a group of mechanics . Unfortunately Hamilton always addressed his inferiors as if they were his inferiors . This is never charming , and I fear the crowd made fun of him . Furious , exasperated , he shouted , You are your own worst enemy ! ' What would he think now when the beast , ' as he used to call the generality , governs , or at least we flatter it into thinking that it governs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's work . Memoirs of Aaron Burr  --  TwoIN 1787 , I TOOK NO PART in the arguments for and against the Constitution . Like everyone else , I read Publius in the newspapers . Like everyone else , I soon worked out which Publius was I lamilton , which Jay , which Madison . Like everyone else , I knew Hobbes and his extraordinary belief ( shared by I lainilton ) that any form of governmentp145no matter how tyrannous is better than anarchy . I had also read Montesquieu whose work so influenced the three Publiuses . Yet at heart I was more pleased than not by the loose confederation of states that existed between 1783 and 1787 . All in all , New York was agreeably governed by the Clinton faction . If certain of the other states were less well-governed , that was their affair ; to be set right by them and not be a group of clever lawyers in Philadelphia . Yes , I was equivocal . A degree of anarchy is no bad thing . Contrary to tradition , the movement for a strong Constitution and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is usual to picture him as a worthy , slow-witted man , a latter-day Cincinnatus only happy on his farm  --  trying to move that leaden plow he invented . He was of course worthy ( if inordinately vain ) and slow-witted in matters of the mind . But no man was cleverer when it came to business and to the promotion of his commercial interests . For very practical reasons , he wanted a strong central government with himself at its head . He was from the beginning a perfect federalist , and used Hamilton far more than Hamilton ever used him in order to make safe his investments in land . Jefferson told me that for all of Washington 's innumerable complaints about the exigencies of public life , he was actually bored to death after the Revolution . " They are making a damned tavern-keeper of me ! " he used to swear when yet another party of curious guests descended upon him at Mount Vernon . It should be noted that at the time of Washington 's election he was , as usual , short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get from the Treasury an advance on his salary . I recollect only one private interview with Washington after the Revolution . It was in October of 1791 , shortly after I arrived in Philadelphia as senator from New York . At the time I was most ambitious to write the true history of the Revolution . Each morning I would get up at five o'clock and go to the State Department , accompanied by a clerk . Together we would study and copy out documents until ten o'clock when I would attend the Senate . Puzzled by certain military details , I requested an audience with His Mightiness . It was granted me so promptly that I ought to have been suspicious . Not only had I replaced Hamilton 's father-in-law in the Senate , but the French Revolution was under way and I confess to having believed for a time that a new era in the world 's history had begun . Later of course I realized that the same bad old era had simply shown us a new face whose Smile would presently reveal bloody fangs . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devotee of the other Revolution and so anathema to the Federalist faction . The President received me in his stately office . He had entirely redone the Morris House to make it resemble a royal palace . A diffident young secretary bowed me into the presence . Washington stood before the fire , as though expecting to be painted . The altogether too famous sallow face was considerably aged . He was also in pain from carbuncles . He greeted me solemnly . Since he remained standing , we faced one another before the fire like ill-matched andirons . I asked him questions about the Revolution ; he made evasive answers . Both questions and answers are now lost . I do recall his cold benediction : " It is a most useful task , Senator Burr , that you are engaged upon . " Plainly he was not happy with my line of questioning which seemed to stress unduly his defeats . The secretary brought him despatches from the west ; he glanced at them , then dismissed the secretary and bade me sit . Slowly , carefully , painfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one huge buttock : the dread carbuncle had erupted in that sensitive fleshy quarter . I commiserated with him over the recent news from the west where his favourite General St. Clair had lost nearly a thousand men to the Indians . Washington was cold and grim . " I shall presently send the Congress a report on this tragic matter . I firmly believe that if we do not destroy these warlike savage tribes , we shall lose the whole of our new lands west of the Ohio . " He spoke the way one imagined a statue would speak . But then he sat too far back in his chair . Gasping with pain , he swore mightily . Aware that he was now no longer royal in my eyes but simply a Virginia planter whose bottom hurt , he said , " I deteriorate before your eyes , do I not ? " " You seem most vigorous , Sir . " " I come from a short-lived family . I do not complain . That is fate . But I did not think that the last stages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only time in our dealings with one another he was almost human  --  an extraordinary condescension considering that I was not a junior officer enamoured of him but an anti-Federalist senator detested by the beloved Hamilton . " Glory is a good medicine , Sir . " " It is palliative . " I caught a glimpse of the wintry dark-toothed smile . " But of course I shall not accept a second term . " As we now know , all presidents talk in this fashion . But at the time none of us undcrstcxld thep147nature of the executive disease ; after all , we were at the beginning of the adventure . " Colonel Burr , I dislike the spirit of faction . I can not fathom why gentlemen of similar interest quarrel so bitterly with one another when they ought to unite in the face of the mob and its excesses . " I was touched by his candour and  --  for him  --  ease of manner with someone he had no reason to trust and less to like . " There are honest differences , Sir , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has come to my attention , Colonel Burr , that you admire much of what is presently happening in France . " " I think , Sir , that the reasons for their revolution are understandable and the principles they assert are admirable . " " Yet were it not for King Louis , the British might still be on this shore . " " I agree that their treatment of him is deplorable . . . " Washington spoke through me , but not to cut me off : he was going deaf and did not hear half what was said to him . " When word came to me of the treasonous acts of a certain Captain Daniel Shays -- a dirty fellow once known to me  --  it was apparent that we must have a strong government to protect our property . Mr. Hamilton concurred with me and we summoned a constitutional convention at which I , at great personal sacrifice , let me say , presided . I regard , Sir , that convention as the most important event of my own career . Because had we not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything . " The face was dark with sudden colour . The hands that were stretched to the fire trembled . " By now that Massachusetts rabble would have divided all property amongst the worthless classes . Not even your French have dared go so far . This is not natural , I said at the time . This must be stopped . We did not fight and win a war with a despot across the sea to be in turn tyrannized by a bloody mob whose contribution to our victory , if I may say so , was considerably less than that of those gentlemen who sacrificed all that they had in order that we be a separate nation . So what we won in that war we mean to keep , Colonel Burr . And I am sure that you agree with that sentiment . " Political theory was the last subject I ever expected to hear from General Washington . He did not read Hobbes or Montesquieu or Plato , or any book at all . But he could add and subtract sums in a ledger , survey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vermin that infest the crops  --  his crops  --  and like that eagle pounce and kill . " I certainly did not support Captain Shays and I do not believe in a promiscuous division of prol ) crty but .  | " I am relieved to hear you say that . " I was being sounded out . Heaven knows what Hamilton had been telling His Mightiness about me . " But I favour a looser federal structure . " " Yes . You are like my old friend Governor Clinton . Such amicable divisions are natural and healthy in a society . " The secretary slipped into the room , and whispered something in the General 's good ear . " Send them in . " Washington heaved himself with a groan from his chair . Several liveried Negroes entered the room carrying trays of sample tableware . Washington indicated that the various knives , forks , plates be displayed on a table . " You may give us your opinion , Colonel Burr . I am told that you have redone Richmond Hill in a most splendid way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I must warn you that splendour is expensive . " " We are in sad accord . " So for half an hour the President and I examined tableware , trying to find a truly republican balance between too plain democratic ware and too rich royal plate . I have never known a man so concerned with the trifles and show of wealth and position as Washington . But then it was his genius always to look the part he was called upon to play , and it is not possible to create a grand illusion without the most painstaking attention to detail . Much of his presidential day was occupied with designing monograms and liveries and stately carriages , not to mention inventing , with Hamilton 's aid , elaborate court protocols . Incidentally , at about this time , the Pennsylvania legislature passed a law that anyone moving into the state with full-grown Negro slaves must free them after six months . Although it was a moot point whether or not the President qualified as a Pennsylvanian simply because the capital was located in that state , Washington thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order that they not get ideas about a freedom he had no intention of granting them . He was the total Virginian . We parted on the most friendly terms . The next day when I went to the State Department to consult the archives , an embarrassed clerk told me that Secretary of State Jefferson was obliged to close the archives to me on the flimsy ground that since certain documents might involve current executive matters the constitutional separation between legislature and executive would be breached . Although Hamilton liked to take credit for my exclusion , Jefferson told me privately that it was actually President Washington who did not want inc. examining too closely his military record . Yet Washington had nothing to fear from inc . Although I wouldp149have depicted him as the incompetent general he was , I would also have demonstrated how he was the supreme creator of this union ; how his powerful will and serpentine cunning made of a loose confederation of sovereign states a strong federal government graven to this day in Washington 's sombre Roman imperial image . SOME DAYS later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He makes corrections . " How hungry for all credit , all glory , poor Hamilton was ! Among his papers they found a note swearing that he had written more than sixty of the Federalist papers when , in fact , he had written at the most fifty . He made claim to some of Jemmy Madison 's best efforts . " Burr blows three blue-white rings of smoke at me ; becomes suddenly mischievous : " Now let us examine Mr. Jefferson . He is sometimes known as the Great Leveller of society . Actually , the only levelling he ever did was of me ! " Memoirs of Aaron Burr  --  ThreeOF ALL THE new republic 's political leaders , I was the most reluctant . Washington , Adams , and Jefferson had spent their lives serving in congresses and assemblies or dealing with them as governors and generals . Hamilton realized from the beginning that only through politics could he make the United States the sort of aristocratic pond in which he would most like to swim and glitter . On the other hand , I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the law as a means of providing for them . But six months after I settled in New York ( April i 784 ) , I was elected to the Assembly . " It will be helpful for your career as a lawyer , " said I lamilton , who dreamed of election but wisely never proposed himself to our small electorate ( of the 3,000 men who lived in New York City onlyp1501,300 owned sufficient property to qualify as voters ) . I thought of Hamilton a few years ago when the franchise was extended to every man twenty-one or over . Had Hamilton lived , he would have been apoplectic at so much democracy , and made Chancellor Kent sound like asans-culotte ! After a single term in which I was not only bored but resentful of being separated from my family , I did not stand for re-election . In 1788 I was again put up for the Assembly on an anti-Federalist ticket and , to my relief , I was defeated . I was still largely indifferent to public matters , and took no active part in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , properly , with the contest for governor in the spring of 1789 . Out of friendship , I supported the Federalist candidate , my old friend Judge Yates . I had warned Clinton that I owed a good deal to the Judge and that , though I was ordinarily a Clinton supporter , this time I must vote against him . " I unnerstan ' , I unnerstan ' . " The Governor gave me his jovial smile which usually presaged political assassination . But I was not to be assassinated since I did not want any political office . For once I was above the battle , much the best place to be for one who craves the victor 's laurel . Clinton was narrowly re-elected . To bind me to him , he offered me the attorney-generalship of the state , a position I did not want . But pressure was brought to bear on me . As Troup said : " You will be the centre of our profession in the state . You will never regret it . " Translated this meant that I was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As it turned out , I was not particularly useful to anyone in a post that for the most part involved steering clear of the various land-selling schemes of the Clintonian faction . Without going into melancholy details , let me simply say that the state administration was as corrupt then as it is now . No doubt this has something to do with the mephitic air of Albany . Meanwhile , my friend Hamilton was like a rocket in the ascent . We now had a republic , a congress , a first magistrate and a de facto prime minister  --  Hamilton himself . He had achieved mastery in New York by getting the state to ratify the Constitution , to the fury of Governor Clinton . Hamilton then selected the first two senators , his father-in-law General Schuyler and his old Massachusetts friend Rufus King . In the process , he enraged his natural allies the Livingstons , denying them what they considered to be their seat in the Senate . The wrath of the Livingstons proved to be the unmaking of Hamilton , and my opportunity . During @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good deal about New York state and occasionally I would stop at Clermont , the Livingston palace on the Iludson where that greatp151disaffected family spent its days brooding and plotting the destruction of my friend Hamilton who had so neatly excluded them from the high offices of the republic . It was in the drawing-room at Clermont that I was included in the most audacious of the Livingston plans . My relations with Chancellor Livingston were always good though hardly intimate . For one thing he was stone-deaf . For another he was very much de haut en bas but then he was , in every sense , de haut , and the rest of the world , relatively speaking , en bas . At the Chancellor 's request , a dozen of us met on one of those silvery October days when the leaves at Clermont are a most furious red-yellow and skittish deer cast violet shadows on the lawn , and watch us watching them . The Chancellor came agreeably to the point . " General Schuyler 's term as senator will end March fourth . I see no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " The true politician like the true general is never surprised . I knew that an alliance between the anti-Federalists ( that is to say , the anti-Hamiltonians ) and the Livingston faction was under way . Governor Clinton had taken to praising the Chancellor at dinner parties . " Wunnerful deep he is , knowin ' so much law ! " Now I was to be the symbol of this new alliance . I was more curious than surprised . " I am not at all certain , Chancellor , that I want to be a senator . " This was true . In those days the Senate 's function was a mystery to everyone , including its presiding officer John Adams who simply could not fathom the duties of a vice-president . " But what am I to do next ? " he would pitifully cry from the chair . To which the only answer was " preside " ; and wait for the President 's death or retirement . A seat in the House of Representatives , on the other hand , was most desirable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preferred it to the Senate . The Chancellor was brisk , once he had understood my shouted demurs . " We have the votes in the state Senate . Governor Clinton assures me you will have the votes in the Assembly , which is his peculiar territory . I see no reason for you not to accept . " I saw at least one reason . What was their price ? We did the stately minuet of politicians manocuvreing . " I am curious , " I said , " as to why you chose me ? " " You are the best-fitted ! " This came from a Livingston relation by marriage . I can not remember which one . But then who can ever get them all straight ? There are so many.  | " You are also the most acceptable . " The Chancellor was benign . " Your support of our friend Judge Yates was taken as a sign of independent mind . And though you are no professional anti-Federalist , your relations with our good governor are excellent . In fact , he told me that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Tactless of him to say so in your presence , Chancellor . " " Tact is not that good man 's strongest point . But he has his virtues even if they are not those of a gentleman . " How vigorously the Livingstons used to employ that noun to cast in bold relief the few of us who were born gentlemen and thus in permanent opposition to that shadowy multitude from among whose seedy dangerous ranks Alexander Hamilton had vaulted to our high bright roost . " But marrying Elizabeth Schuyler was hardly enough , do you think ? " as the mistress of Clermont liked to say . " No wife can entirely change what her husband is . " Make him legitimate , she meant ; make him one of us . It is ironic that Hamilton who worshipped the aristocrats was never taken seriously by them except as a tool . He might have been president had he turned to the people he came from , to the mechanics who had the vote , to the men in the taverns who could appreciate in him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Hamilton wanted no part of the lower orders . He rejected his own origins and consorted only with the well-born and the rich , serving them truly and himself , at the end , not at all. " lt would seem to me , Chancellor , that your claim on the Senate seat is greatest of all . " " Of course it is . " The Chancellor was bland . " But at the moment no Livingston can be elected . You can . It has been arranged . Will you accept ? " Expectantly , he cupped a hand to his ear . " Yes , " I bellowed . " But without ties to either faction . " The Chancellor stared thoughtfully at the dusty family portraits . The Livingstons think , not incorrectly , of New York as being their personal property , a gift from King Charles forever threatened not only by the democracy but , most bitterly , by their rivals the Schuyler family . The Livingstons of those days would have preferred the tumbril and the guillotine to playing second fiddle to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And so because of the rivalry between two proud , foolish clans , I was chosen , in January of 791 , the third United States senator from New York . The fact that I had not sought the office nor wanted the office gave Inc strength . Although I was anti Federalist , I was on good terms with manyp153Federalist leaders and so could act with perfect freedom . I was not thirty-five years old , and from an important region . I accepted my destiny . I would become the president , an office for which I believed that I was by temperament and training uniquely qualified . Why else had fate set me so high on the ladder ? All I need do was ascend . I had no fear of Hamilton . His limitations were already apparent to me . The man I should have feared I thought my friend . By allowing Jefferson to deceive me , I lost all . Memoirs of Aaron BurrTHOMAS JEFFERSON has written that he did not meet me until I came to the Senate in Philadelphia ( the capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ junto ) . Although often prone to truth , Jefferson was never a fanatic when his own legend was at stake . We had met earlier than that . Since Congress did not meet until the autumn of 1791 , I spent the summer at home with my wife and child , knowing that we would soon be separated for long periods . Houses were hard to come by in Philadelphia ; and my wife was ill . During the summer , Jefferson and Madison made their famous tour of New York and New England . They were interested , they said , in botany as well as the vicious habits of the Hessian fly . Actually they were creating support for themselves against Hamilton who now controlled President , Congress and Cabinet . Quite alone in the Cabinet , Jefferson fought to uphold the republic that Hamilton wanted to turn  --  so Jefferson maintained  --  into a corrupt replica of the British system , with Commons , Lords and Crown . About the middle of June , I was invited by Henrietta Colden to a small dinner for the Secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attended alone . I lenrietta was a great favourite in the society of that era . She had a lively , bright manner that acted like champagne on even the dullest guest . In fact , the widower Jefferson was suspected of being more than just a friend to the widow Colden who was , for a time , Hamilton 's mistress . But a hen what lively lady in New York had not been , more or less seriously , addressed by Hamilton ? I should think that his amative bump was uncommonly large . There were a dozen men and women in Henrietta 's flowery drawing-room . When I was announced , she seized my arm ; led me to the tallest man in the room.  | " Our new senator ! " she cried , assuming that the tall man needed no introduction , that I needed no name to go with my new title . A rather large limp hand touched mine . I am not usually conscious of height but with Jefferson I always felt in danger of a crick in the neck as he obliged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eye level  --  to look up into that freckled fox face with the bright hazel eyes , and delicate thin-lipped smile . " Colonel Burr , what an honour ! " The voice was low but beguiling . Even face to face ( or face to chest ) one had to strain to hear him , particularly when he slipped into one of his reveries and the words would flow beautifully , inexhaustibly , sometimes interminably , yet never entirelywithout interest for one always found good things even as he found them in that fine speculative torrent . He was the most charming man I have ever known , as well as the most deceitful . Were the philosopher 's charm less , the politician 's deceit might not have been so shocking . We exchanged compliments . " Mr. Madison is ill ! " Henrietta announced gaily to the company . " So you must make do with me . " Jefferson gave her a fond look . " One Virginian is very like another , according to Mr. Hamilton . " Henrietta defended Hamilton . She knew nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length his recent trip to New England . " A botanical excursion , " he said quite seriously . " Mr. Madison and I have been fascinated by what we have seen and learned , particularly about the mating habits of the Hessian fly . " Jefferson affected great interest in my views . Wanted to know my estimate of Governor Clinton whom he had briefly met at Albany . Betrayed a detailed knowledge of my election . Wanted to know my precise relations with the Livingston family . Since the Chancellor was at the other end of the table , my decorous praise of him was no doubt repeated . In my view Jefferson wrote rather less well than he talked , but no less copiously . From the colour of Negroes ( the result , he felt , of a peculiarly virulent form of leprosy ) to the proper building of walls , Jefferson not only had an opinion on everything but was driven to express it . Indiscreet letters of his will one day delight and trouble unborn historians . Certainly his letters to me ( most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good sense . Unfortunately Jefferson did not always know when to be silent . A few months before our meeting at Mrs. ( : olden 's , Tom Paine 's The Rights of Man was published , with words of praise front Jetli  --  rson on its cover.  |p155Since  the author had been recently indicted for treason by the British government , it was thought tactless of the American Secretary of State not only to praise the traitor but , gratuitously , to remark upon the danger to the United States from " heresies " of the sort Paine was indicting . The Hamiltonian Gazette of the United States promptly published an attack on Jefferson by one " Publicola , " thought to be John Adams . Actually Publicola was the Vice-President 's son , John Quincy Adams . " I can not for the life of me think why Mr. Adams should be so distressed . " Jefferson was disingenuous . " Possibly because he is a heretic . " This from Philip Freneau who was then writing savage indictments of Hamilton and Adams for the Daily Advertiser . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Freneau to dinner . Respecting ideas not men , Freneau was not the sort of prickly person Jefferson usually liked in attendance . But two months after our dinner party Freneau was drawing a good salary as clerk of foreign languages in Jefferson 's State Department at Philadelphia , and editing for Jefferson a new anti-Administration newspaper called the National Gazette . Everyone was shocked . It is not usual to give government money to an editor whose policy is the destruction of that government . Quite sensibly , if maliciously , Hamilton proposed that both Jefferson and Freneau resign if they did not approve of the government which paid their salaries . From time to time , Jefferson would deny that he had any connection with Freneau 's newspaper , but then he had the fortunate gift of believing implicitly anything he himself said at the moment he said it . For our benefit , Jefferson spun his version of the quarrel with Adams . " I confess that when I wrote of heresies in my letter  --  which I never gave the publisher permission to use . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be certain . " . . . those heresies I referred to were the ones to which Mr. Adams inclines . He is a monarchist through and through , and has told me as much . " This was later denied to me by Adams himself . " I never in my life had a serious conversation with Mr. Jefferson on any subject , " said Adams two years later . " But if 1 were a secret monarchist , Mr. Jefferson would be the last person I would confide in . He knows of course I am no such thing nor is that Creole bastard . But Mr. Jefferson does know that the surest way for him to rise is to excite the people against Hamilton and me by pretending that we want a king when all we want is a strong federal government . " Of the sort Jefferson himself was to achieve some years later.  |p156Chancellor  Livingston wondered if perhaps the Secretary of State was exaggerating . The bright hazel eyes grew round as a child 's and the voice dropped so low that we were all leaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Gentlemen , there is  --  I assure you  --  a plot at the highest level of this country to change our institutions . To make them over in England 's image . Once , in my presence , Hamilton described our Constitution as a ' shilly-shally affair . ' Oh , his contempt for this republic is as brazen as that of any Catiline ! " Little did I know then that in time 's womb the classic traitor 's name would be used to describe me , with Jefferson himself as happy midwife at that so unnatural birth . But ignorant of the future , I listened raptly to the beautiful low voice describe Hamilton 's habit of giving speculator friends secret Treasury information , all the while attempting to set up a monarchy with British gold . In retrospect , this sort of talk sounds perfect madness . At the time , it sounded perfectly plausible . Freneau was obviously much taken with this discourse . So was I. There was something in Jefferson 's manner that held me as no other man was ever able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recklessness with the truth , I never failed to respond to that hushed voice , to those bright child 's eyes , to his every fanatical notion , to his every rich slander . He was a kind of wizard , no doubt of it . The Chancellor teased Jefferson about his famous remark during Shays 's rebellion  --  that from time to time the tree of liberty 's proper manure is blood . Jefferson responded with all seriousness . " I meant only that we should congratulate ourselves that in two hundred years we have had only one such internal uprising . It is a tribute to our sense of justice that redress comes before rebellion . " " Even so , you are now the hero of all the Shaysites . " At heart the Chancellor was a Federalist , forced to pose as a Republican . Had he not been passed over for chief justice , he would have found the ideas  --  if not the company  --  of Jefferson most uncongenial . " We met many of these poor men in New England . " Jefferson looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had too little faith in our ability to set things right . . . " " Like forty-per-cent interest rates ? like crushing taxes ? like thousands of men in prison for debt ? " Eyes fixed on Jefferson , Freneau resembled a doctor who is waiting to see if the patient will recover or succumb to a radical dosage of mercury . " Of course many of their complaints are justified . I find it a frightful business imprisoning men for debt . " As well he might ! The one thingp157that Jefferson , Hamilton and I had in common was indebtedness . We all lived beyond our means and on the highest scale . Hamilton died owing money . Jefferson died a pauper , with Monticello collapsing about his head . Fortunately , unlike the average farmer or mechanic , we could not be jailed for debt . We could indefinitely collect signers and co-signers to our notes until the sordid conditions of our borrowings entirely vanished under the scrolls and flourishes of those wealthy magnates-who are always anxious to befriend a man of state . Freneau added to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those in prisons are debtors . Well , Sir , if I had been a poor man in that state , I would have marched with Daniel Shays . " " Mr. Freneau ! " The Chancellor was appalled . " Surely you do not favour what that man favoured ? Surely you do not want all property evenly divided among the citizens ? " There was an expectant moment at the table . From the drawing-room we could hear the harsh rather unlovely laughter of the lovely Mrs. Golden . Jefferson slumped down on his spine , shoulders hunched , head to one side , freckled hands covering the lower part of his face . He did not intervene . Freneau chose lightness . " I would let your family keep Clermont , Chancellor . But Mr. Jefferson would have to give up Monticello for he believes in democracy and you do not . " Jefferson laughed a bit too merrily . The others pretended to enjoy a joke that amused no one present . Two years later such a joke would have been impossible ; by then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Daniel Shays a nightmare . In fact , with the murders in Paris , no serious person in the United States has ever again suggested a division of wealth . When the party ended , Jefferson and I walked out into Hanover Square . A waning moon was visible in the west . In the pale glow , Jefferson seemed to hang over me like a tree or like the sharp rise of some cliff ( yes , and wait for the avalanche to bury you alive ) . He suffered from chronic headache , and used to wonder why . " Perhaps , " I said in response to the familiar complaint , " it is your height . You are too close to heaven , to the thunder and lightning . " Instead of smiling at this pleasantry , he frowned . " Do you think so ? I must ask Dr. Rush . " Jefferson walked loosely , in a shambling way  --  he was , I should note , very much the French exquisite during this period . His clothes were sumptuous ; there was always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lace about his long person , and a huge golden topaz on his finger . Later when he becamep158president and the leader of the democracy , he took to wearing old slippers and frayed jackets in the presidential palace . Like Napoleon , he was a fascinating actor but far more subtle than the Corsican and ultimately far more successful . " You speak of Montesquieu , " said Jefferson , taking my arm . " At worst he is a bit too English in his bias . Yet on most issues I find him congenial and wise . Certainly he is a true republican . " We made our way around a family of sleeping pigs in the Broad Way . Darkness was almost total ; the moon had gone ; the streets were empty . I mention Jefferson 's comment on Montesquieu 's Esprit des Lois because twenty years later he was to turn fiercely on its author who had maintained that a true republic of the democratic order can exist only on a small scale . Certainly this " ideal " form of government is not practical for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illegally bought Louisiana  --  thereby doubling the size of the United States and putting an end once and for all to any hope of our society evolving into a true republic of the sort dreamed of by the Baron de Montesquieu and proclaimed by Jefferson . To justify himself , Jefferson turned on his old idol and attacked him for ( favourite and characteristic Jefferson word ) " heresy . " But of course it was Jefferson who was the heretic , and Montesquieu the true believer in democracy . I got the subject onto political matters . It was already apparent that Adams would succeed Washington . But then what ? I feared Hamilton would succeed Adams . The only alternative was Jefferson . I did not rule out myself as leader of the anti-Federalist faction but I was practical enough to realize that as a Virginian , Jefferson would have first call on the presidency once Massachusetts had been served by Adams . But no matter what the future held , I was necessary to Jefferson that summer night as we slipped in the garbage , and tried not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead . " We are apparently doomed to political faction . " Jefferson sounded melancholy . " I put the blame on Hamilton . He is corrupt through and through . " I did not disagree although my personal feeling for Hamilton was most friendly . ( I did not know to what extent he was slandering me even then . ) But Jefferson had no illusions about our enemy . " He is driven to make a monarchy out of this republic . " " With himself as Alexander the Great ? " Jefferson had no humour . " With Adams as king , I should think , and himself as permanent prime minister , another Walpole . I must warn you , Colonel Burr , Hamilton is treachery incarnate ! "  |p159I  changed the subject . " How did you find Governor Clinton at Albany ? " Jefferson tended to obsession on the subject of monarchy , a vice he attributed to anyone who stood in his way . It was Jefferson 's conceit that he alone represented democracy and that all the rest of us from Washington to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cup of tea . Fortunately George Clinton was always a safe subject . He was not a monarchist  --  he was simply the absolute ruler of New York , and an enemy to the Federalists . Jefferson 's soft voice purred when he discussed his meeting with Clinton . " A vigorous man , do n't you think ? With unusual theories about the Hessian fly . Of course your governor is not exactly a man of learning but there is something likeable in his roughness . You know , he is much pleased with your election . " " Yes , I know . " A night-coach nearly ran us down in front of Trinity Church . " I must confess that the loss of Senator Schuyler pleased me quite as much as the knowledge that such a distinguished supporter of the democracy as you would be joining us in Philadelphia . " When Jefferson wanted one 's support , he was shameless in his flattery . " Hamilton may lose his majority in the Senate . " " He still has the President . " Jefferson sighed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world . " " Let us hope , Mr. Jefferson , that the President is wrong . " Even in the darkness I was aware that those bright eyes were looking down upon me . He did not answer immediately . " Perhaps , " he said at last , " it might be useful to form a series of clubs or associations , for those who are devoted to the democracy . " " There is the Society of St. Tammany . " Tammany had been founded four years earlier as a patriotic club where solid New York greengrocers and upholsterers pretended to be Indians . " But the Tammany membership is mostly Federalist . " Jefferson 's pursuit of the dread Hessian fly had not entirely distracted him from the political realities of the small but crucial New York electorate . " Not entirely . Anyway , I have friends in the Society . They can be guided . " " It might be useful if our friends were to set up Democratic societies , particularly now when the revolution in France is so popular . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jefferson took my hand in both of his . " We have , dear Colonel Burr , so much to do . So many battles to fight , so many heresies to refute . We must stand by one another . "  | " You may depend on me in all things , " I said . I was sincere . Was he ? It is hard to say . Jefferson was a ruthless man who wanted to create a new kind of world , dominated by independent farmers each living on his own rich land , supported by slaves . It is amazing how beguilingly he could present this contradictory vision . But then in all his words if not deeds Jefferson was so beautifully human , so eminently vague , so entirely dishonest but not in any meretricious way . Rather it was a passionate form of self-delusion that rendered Jefferson as president and as man ( not to mention as writer of tangled sentences and lunatic metaphors ) confusing even to his admirers . Proclaiming the unalienable rights of man for everyone ( excepting slaves , Indians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to seize the Floridas by force , dreamed of a conquest of Cuba , and after his illegal purchase of Louisiana sent a military governor to rule New Orleans against the will of its inhabitants . Finally , in his second term , when Jefferson saw that he could not create the Arcadian society he wanted , he settled with suspicious ease for the Hamiltonian order , and like a zealous Federalist proceeded to levy taxes , and to create a navy ( admittedly on the cheap  --  his famed gunboats had to be scrapped ) , while setting for the west and the south an imperial course as coldly and resourcefully as any Bonaparte . Had Jefferson not been a hypocrite I might have admired him . After all , he was the most successful empire-builder of our century , succeeding where Bonaparte failed . But then Bonaparte was always candid when it came to motive and Jefferson was always dishonest . In the end , candour failed ; dishonesty prevailed . I dare not preach a sermon on that text . At the beginning of October 1791 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Second Street in the house of two elderly widows , one mother to the other , one deafer than the other . Very kindly the ladies suggested that I not strain my senatorial voice in trying to communicate with them . Since I was their only lodger , silence reigned in South Second Street and I slept marvellously well in a back bedroom . On the 24th of October the Second Congress convened , and the next day President Washington haltingly read to us a message prepared for him by Hamilton . I remember thinking how uncommonly healthy the President looked , his normally sallow face quite ruddy . It was Senator James Monroe of Virginia who enlightened me . " He 's taken to painting himself like a tavern sign whenever he appears in public . At home , he looks to be a hundred . " Monroe 's contempt for the father of his country was . apparent even then while Washington detested the senator from his home state : thought him a regular Jacobite.  |p161I  was selected by the Senate to respond to the presidential address . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that session 's crisis ) , I went with the other members of Congress to the Morris mansion in High Street ( called without irony " the palace " ) . Like schoolboys we filed into the great man 's presence . Magnificently dressed , holding a cocked hat , sword at his side , heavily and plausibly painted , George Washington stood before the fireplace with Jefferson to his right and Hamilton to his left . Hamilton looked more than ever like a small ginger terrier at the side of those two giants  --  each was more than six feet tall ; does such physical altitude insure greatness ? Even Monroe was tall though constantly stooped . Vice-President Adams mumbled a few remarks ( he at least was comfortingly small and fat ) . Slowly and with care , the President inclined his head ( when newly applied , the fine white powder he used to dress his hair sometimes gave the startling effect of a cloudy nimbus about that storied head ) . I responded in the name of the Congress to his address , and he responded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , smiling a most curious , perhaps involuntary smile . Then doors were flung open and there in the drawing-room stood the Lady Washington surrounded by various Philadelphia ladies . White servants in royal red livery dispensed sweet plum-cake and wine to us loyal commons . I found myself with the fiercely republican Senator Maclay ( who had lost his seat in March but was still in Philadelphia ) , an angry figure whose loathing of monarchy made Jefferson seem a mere dilettante on that sore subject . " Look at King George ! " Scornfully Maclay indicated the President who was stationed now in the centre of the room receiving ladies who curtsied deeply to him . " If the people could see this . . . " " They would be delighted . " It is my view that the people themselves are not democratic ; only slave-owning aristocrats like Jefferson can afford to believe in democracy . " I am not delighted . " Maclay watched with disgust as Washington inclined his head to each of a number of gentlemen who filed slowly past him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He deems it vulgar . " Then I was taken up by the beautiful Mrs. Bingham ( a cousin of Peggy Shippen Arnold ) . " We expect you later . After this ! " Mrs. Bingham 's gesture toward Philadelphia 's high society , and particularly to its queen Mrs. Binghamp162whose mansion on Third Street was the most elaborate private house in the United States . " And you , too , Mr. Hamilton , " for that handsome little figure had suddenly appeared at my elbow . I put out my hand in greeting only to realize too late that the Secretary of the Treasury had taken to imitating his chief . He gave me a decorous bow , arms to his side . " It is a pleasure , Colonel Burr , to see you here . " We played at friendship . " I regret that my presence should be at the expense of General Schuyler . " " There will be other elections . " Hamilton 's curious smile seemed permanently fixed to his lips . " I hope that you and I can avoid the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belong to no faction . " I was blunt , and spoke the truth . " I was chosen by both Federalists and Republicans . " " I know , and they could not have chosen more shrewdly . " Whatever that meant . But I was as intent as he on playing out the scene , and with the same urbanity . " Yet the divisions here do not seem to me to be too deep . " " You have just arrived . " The smile went ( as did Mrs. Bingham ) ; the succeeding frown was real . " Jefferson is intent on destroying this administration from within . " In a tirade it all came out . Hamilton 's tragedy was also his gift : he was a man of high intellectual passion whose weapon was language . Unable to remain silent on any subject that excited him he , literally , dug his own grave with words . " I know that you met with Jefferson and Madison in New York . . " Only with Mr. Jefferson . I 'm afraid that your informant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hamilton 's eyes flashed with sudden good humour . He was as mercurial as the weather of that tropical West Indian island from which he came . " I am sure Jefferson did his best to convince you that I want to put a crown on the General 's head . " " No , on your own . " If this was to be badinage , I would sustain my end . But it was not . The frown returned . " I think , Burr , that Jefferson is mad . Certainly on that subject . First , he has been away too long in France , and has a womanish attachment to that nation . He has also decided that their present form of anarchy is highly desirable  --  at least to contemplate at a distance . I doubt if he will ever surrender that Virginia farm of his to the people . Oh , Burr , I tell you he is the perfect hypocrite ! " I was embarrassed by the suddenness of this outburst , particularly since Jefferson was dreamily watching us from the far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be stopped . " You know what a bloody time of it we had in the last Congress , over my plan for the Bank . " I said that indeed Ip163did . The dispute over the United States Bank was , in effect , the dividing line between two factions which , presently , became  --  and continue to be  --  two political parties . The northern states interested in trade and manufactures favoured the Bank . The agricultural southern states detested it ; farmers are always short of cash and to a man they fear banks , mortgages , foreclosures . Hamilton 's grievances against Jefferson were manifold and such was his passionate nature that he could not keep from confiding them to me , a potential enemy but then , for all he knew , a potential ally , since I was senator from a state devoted to trade and manufactures . " Three years ago when Jefferson became secretary of state , we made an arrangement . I wanted the federal government to assume the debts of the states . But as Virginia had paid off most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I appealed to Jefferson . We were standing outside the President 's house in New York . I practically got down on my knees to him , begged him to help me change the Virginia votes . Warned him that other states would secede if we did not help them pay their debts . He entirely agreed , he said , and  --  now this is crucial  --  he agreed that the assumption of debts was in the interest of all the states . He then suggested that I put my case to Madison at a dinner in his house . I repeated for Madison what I had said to Jefferson but Madison was cool to the plan , and so to my surprise was Jefferson , who kept changing the subject . Spoke of climate . Of flora . Of fauna . Of the natural beauties of Virginia . I did my best to appear spellbound when he favoured me with a long digression on the physical nature of the opossum . There is a pouch , it seems , in the stomach of the opossum . Jefferson was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our deep philosopher was after . He wanted the new capital of the country to be placed in Virginia  --  specifically on the banks of the Potomac River near Georgetown . If I gave him the capital , he and Madison would support me on the assumption of debts . I agreed . I had no choice . And that is how my bill to assume the debts of the states promptly passed the Congress , with the aid of the Virginia delegation , and that is why nine years from now Virginia will have the capital of the country , assuming those desultory farmers remember to build a city between now and then . " At the time I rather doubted Hamilton 's version . Later I discovered it was correct . But then he was always truthful in such matters . Unlike Jefferson , I lamilton never lied about issues , only men . " It would seem to me , " I was thinking rapidly , " that if Jefferson is so agreeable to arrangements , you must simply keep on making it worth his while . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beast attracts him . He would like to level everyone , and not because he has any abiding love for the majesty of the multitude but because he is a demagogue and thinks that to cry monarchist ' at the President or at me is the surest way of inciting the people against us . Well , if he succeeds , Heaven help him ! No Washington , no United States . No United States , no Jefferson . He is without conscience . " I made my only objection . " I would not under-estimate his zeal . He strikes me as a man addicted to the most rigid principles . . . " " Principles ! You should have seen the letter he recently wrote a friend in Paris . " During this period the one certain way of gaining total publicity was not through the newspapers but through the postal service . In consequence , most of us wrote in cipher ; even so , letters were constantly intercepted and the ciphers regularly broken . Hamilton and Jefferson spent a good deal of time reading one another 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Short to invest his money in the bank ! In the very bank Jefferson is publicly accusing of being a menace to the republic ! Oh , he is as two-faced as Janus ! Do you know why he is so eager for a war in Europe ? Because it will increase the price of the wheat he is growing in prospect of just such a war . He has also instructed his farm agent to grow hemp , cotton and flax because when the fighting begins in Europe he will be able to make a huge profit here at home . So Jefferson actually promotes war as being  --  in his very phrase  --  ' helpful to domestic manufacture ' ! " I have no idea if any of this was true . The important thing is that Hamilton believed it to be true . What zealots those two were ! Yet of the two I regard Hamilton as the more honourable . Certainly he had the more realistic view of the world . Trained as a boy by Jews in the Indies , he understood money and commerce in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , excepting Gallatin . Personally Hamilton was probably honest , though surrounded by thieves . One such thief was his close friend and assistant secretary of the Treasury , William Duer . Hamilton allowed Duer to sell Treasury secrets to speculators until Duer went to jail . But then Hamilton was no judge of character . He lived in a rarefied world of theory ; unlike Jefferson who appeared unworldly yet understood human character better than any other politician I have ever known . Had the two been combined into a single statesman , we might have been governed by Plato 's philosopher-king , and I would have gone rather earlier to Mexico , my Syracuse ! I recall no more of our exchange . I I , unilton was desperate for votes inp165the Senate now that he had lost Schuyler . He was counting on my neutrality  --  on my accessibility to reason in the coming sessions . As it turned out , much of the time we were allied . As I was leaving " the palace , " I found myself walking beside Adams  --  known behind his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a nose like a parrot 's beak and a cold piercing eye , Adams was an imposing if somewhat comical figure , famed for his gaffes : as president he once told a hostile Republican Congress how honoured he had been to be presented to the King of England . He never did understand men , but he was quite at home with their ideas . As we waited for our carriage ( this was a part of our pretentiousness in Philadelphia : although most distances were short we all owned or hired carriages to take us from Congress Hall to " palace " to boarding-house ) , Adams said , " Your family is highly regarded in New England , Senator . " This sort of pronouncement was purest Adams . " Your grandfather Jonathan Edwards might be said to have shaped our very being . " " Then I understand New England better . " For all Adams ' bluntness , he was not  --  like Jefferson  --  immune to irony . " Yes , I suspect you do . You are a contemporary of Mr. Hamilton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " We are almost exactly contemporary . But no more . " " Faction ! Faction ! This place stinks of political faction ! " Fisher Ames heard this as he passed us on his unexpectedly democratic way home by foot . " For some , " Ames flung at Adams , " this stench is like attar of roses . Adams was joined by his wife , a lady always amiable to me . She spoke of Hamilton with a degree of fondness . " I have the desire to be like a mother to him . " Mrs. Adams was not particularly motherly in manner . " Well , I have no desire to be his father , and could not ! " Adams ' mind was indeed shaped by my grandfather 's puritanism . So much so that John Adams was not , finally , a creature of our century at all but a relic of old New England days , of a wrathful god delighting in the ubiquity of sin and its terrible punishment . Yet Adams ' intelligence , though limited , was profound . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not know he did not suspect existed . Hamilton 's bastardy used to exercise Adams even before they quarrelled ( led to the quarrel ? ) . Mrs. Adams reproved her mate . But Adams was not done with the subject . " One day the world will understand that young man you want to be a mother to for what he is : a natural orphan . " " Charity , John . " " I merely observe . Hamilton needs , lusts for fathers and mothers andp166he picks them up wherever he goes . The President did not adopt him as a son , he adopted the President as a father . He has been attaching himself to older men since he was a boy , an orphan , an outcast from the respectable world and quite rightly , too , considering how he was born , and of what blood . Senator Burr , the world is stern but the world is just . " The vice-presidential carriage arrived , splattering us sternly but justly with mud . As the groom descended , Adams turned to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be the better for your attendance . " " As it is better , Sir , for your presidence of our chamber . " A wide cold stare raked my face like grape-shot . " I fear this Congress may be like the first , full of faction . I also fear those members who are too attached to France 's vicious revolution . " " I fear all attachments which are excessive . " Adams took this ambiguity in stride . " We are in danger of government by professional office-holders . . . " " Come , John . " Mrs. Adams was impatient and uneasy . Adams was not finished . " By men of party rather than by men of state . " " It is sometimes hard to tell the difference . " " I can tell . " From inside the carriage Mrs. Adams yanked hard at her husband 's arm which was just inside the door . " Can you also tell change when it comes , Mr. Adams ? And whether it be for good or ill ? " " When it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had now got the Vice-President by sheer force into the carriage . Mine was the last word as the groom shut the door . " New occasions , Mr. Adams , require new men and new ideas . " The carriage started with a jolt . I heard Adams say to his wife in a tone of exasperation , " Look at him , sleek as a duck ! " I felt a certain distress . What he said was true . I had gained weight with all the party-going . I vowed a new regimen the next day . As I waited for my carriage , I noticed James Monroe behind me . He had heard the end of our conversation . He made a face . " They 're powerful enemies , those old Tories . " " Shall we replace them presently ? " Almost casually , I set about the first of my alliances . " Can it be done , without bloodshed ? " " It can be done , and it will be done , if we are wise . " " Are you a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can see what is in front of me . This faction mistrusts the people . All we need do is let the people know in what contempt their masters hold them , then they will do the rest . " I got into my rented carriage . " Are you with Jefferson ? " Monroe called after me . " In this matter , what republican is not ? " On that equivocal , as Hamilton would say , note , we parted  --  with Monroe shouting after me to beware the Philadelphia tradesmen as " sharpers . " In those few minutes on the steps of Washington 's " palace " I had made my first move toward the presidency . This MORNING I found Colonel Burr in his office , much amused by anaccount of a recent Senate performance by Henry Clay . " Mr. Clay apparently made the rafters ring , denouncing Andrew Jackson . He then turned to the Vice-President who was in the chair . Pleaded with him to bring his friend the President to reason . Listen to this . Entreat him to pause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice , " to pause and to reflect that there is a point beyond which human endurance can not go , and let him not drive this brave , generous and patriotic people to madness and despair ! ' " Burr even managed the half-sob Clay sometimes works with such effect into his codas . " Then Mr. Van Buren turned over the chair to a senator , made his way down the aisle to where Henry Clay still stood with arms out-stretched in a gesture of pleading and , as everyone stared , said in a soft little voice , Mr. Clay , might I have a pinch of your fine maccoboy snuff ? ' " Burr 's laughter echoed in the stuffy office . " I le sounds like you , Colonel . " " I was never so superbly deflationary . But then we had no audience in the early days of the Senate . Our proceedings were secret until I insisted on making there public . The level of our debate changed over night . Nothing so improves a senator 's speech as an audience. , , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Colonel  --  leader ! " " You exaggerate , my boy . " " I was passing in the street and thought I 'd bring you the news straight from the port . Lafayette is dead ! " " One can not say that he was taken before his time . We must restrain our grief . " The Colonel was suitably dry . " He must have been  --  what , eighty ? " " Seventy-seven . Younger than you , Colonel . " " Then I shudder at this cold premonitory wind from France . Poor boy ! So much to look forward to . I trust he is now in Heaven with General Washington and , side by side , they rest on a cloudy mantle of stars for all eternity , dreaming up disastrous military engagements . " " News from Washington City . " Swartwout looked conspiratorial . I withdrew . Later when the Colonel began his dictation , France was on his mind . Memoirs of Aaron Burr  --  FiveIT is DIFFICULT for people in 1834 to understand to what extent the life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact of Europe , particularly by France and England . Yet no one preferred it that way ; not even the Tories who loved the King wanted us to be embroiled in the problems of Europe . Unfortunately , we had no choice . At the beginning France was our chief ally . After all , had it not been for the French fleet , there would still be a British garrison on the Battery . But the Revolution in France distressed our Tories  --  or Federalists as they came to be known ; a nice irony since they had not wanted any federal government , preferring the King . But after we forced independence on them , the Tories wanted a strong federal government in order the better to protect their property and to keep the people in its place . Looking back , we Republicans were not much different . Neither Jefferson nor I fretted particularly over the Constitution 's limited franchise . I recall that in the election of 1789 there were over 300,000 residents of New York state of whom only I z , 000 were qualified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no one was allowed to vote directly for president . That was considered much too dangerous a privilege even for our small propertied electorate . They could vote for state legislators who in turn would select a president.  |p169Between  the First and Second Congresses , what Adams called " the spirit of faction " emerged . Hamilton was no more monarchist than Jefferson but he did see the American future as being dominated by manufacture and commerce which , in turn , required banks , taxation , cities , an army and a navy . Jefferson saw the whole continent as a kind of Virginia , filled with honest yeomen enjoying the fruits of black labour . Jefferson wanted no cities , no banks , no manufactories , no taxes . Jefferson was wrong and Hamilton was right . Worse , Jefferson was impractical . The divisions in Washington 's cabinet were exacerbated by the French Revolution . When the Bastille fell in - 789 even the Federalists were for a moment thrilled . Although every American owed a considerable debt to Louis XVI , we were all of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he presided over a republic . I fear we were a bit simple at the time , interpreting everything that happened in Paris as a sort of Gallic repetition of our own glorious experiment . Sometime in April - 793 we learned of the execution of Louis XVI . Republicanism had truly triumphed . Pigtails were cut off and hair worn a la Brutus . Trousers replaced small-clothes . Everyone started calling everyone else " citizen " and " citizeness , " and the bad manners so many foreign visitors remark upon when they come to our shores ( the children who do not respond politely to adults , the surliness of tradesmen and servants ) began that spring with the arrival of the French ambassador Citizen Genet . Over night it was considered slavish for the lower orders to be polite to anyone . Yet before Genet 's arrival , Americans were considered the politest people in the world  --  resembling the British but with greater sweetness and less servility . After Genet they became what they are today  --  truculent , sullen and envious . At the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portraits hung on the walls of our Senate chamber ( and everyone , including Mrs. Bingham , remarked how much she resembled Marie Antoinette ) . After the beheadings , various Republicans  --  including Freneau  --  wanted the portraits taken down . Jefferson 's view of the portraits is unknown but he did delight in the executions . " After all , " he said to me , " was ever such a prize won with so little blood ? " I said that from all accounts the prize had cost a good deal of blood . But Jefferson was hard . " Rather than their revolution fail , Colonel Burr , I would see half the earth desolated ! After all , if in every country there was but one Adam and Eve left , one free Adam and one free Eve remaining , the world would be better than it is now . " I could not believe niv cars . Either Jefferson was a fhx ) l in his zealotry or an active principle of evil.  |p170Since  France was now at war with England , Austria , Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on our maintaining a strict neutrality . This enraged Republicans and Federalists . The first wanted war with England ; the second with France . As a result , there were now two plainly recognisable political parties : the Republican party which was pro-French , anti-British and in tone egalitarian ; the Federalist party which was the reverse . The Republican national leadership consisted of Jefferson , Madison , Clinton and myself . The Federalists included Hamilton , Adams , Jay , Knox and , more or less covertly , Washington himself . On Thursday , May 16 , 1793 , Citizen Edmond Genet arrived in Philadelphia to present his credentials to the President . He had already presented his credentials to the American people . Arriving some weeks before in Charleston , South Carolina , he had made a triumphal progress toward our capital , addressing along the way  --  and in excellent English  --  cheering crowds . The Federalists were alarmed . Jefferson , however , was benign . Do we not all detest tyrants ? An enthusiastic Philadelphia crowd assembled at Gray 's Ferry to welcome Genet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he delivered a powerful address to a dozen startled loungers whom he took to be the Republican party . But the next few days more than compensated for the comedy of this debut . A splendid dinner was given him at Oeller 's Hotel . Because of the Neutrality Proclamation , those of us who held public office were requested to attend ex officio . Needless to say the entire Republican delegation to the Congress was on hand . Monroe and I sat together at the end of a long table in the main assembly-room . I confess we spent a good deal of time looking about to see if Jefferson , the enthusiast of the rights of man , would be present or whether Jefferson , the signer of the Neutrality Proclamation , would be absent . Wisely , as it turned out , the apostle of democracy chose not to be present . Wine was drunk in large quantities , and Citizen Genet , a lively fat fellow of thirty with a face somewhat like that of the young Benedict Arnold , made the rounds of the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and me to the representative of liberty , equality , fraternity . " I visit your state soon , Senator Burr . " The Citizen held both my hands in both of his . He had a most histrionic way of talking . " We shall do good work there for freedom . " " It is an open field , Citizen . "  | " I want very much to meet your Governor Clinton . " " I am sure that he will want to meet you . " That proved to be something of an overstatement . Within a year the Girondins ( Genet 's faction in Paris ) had been slaughtered by the Jacobins and the new government recalled Genet to Paris in order that his head be cut off . Reluctant to lose such a fine decoration , Genet chose to marry Governor Clinton 's daughter and to settle down on Long Island ; and with her money he became the gentleman-farmer that he is today . " Burr , I despise the French ! " The crude Clinton was distraught . " A nation of hair-dressersand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has to go and pick a crowing , penniless French cockerel as a husband ! " But Clinton 's cockerel was very much cock of the walk that night at Oeller 's Hotel . There were at least twenty toasts to him or to his country . In fact , I proposed one to " the republics of France and America  --  may they forever be united in the cause of liberty . " A cap of liberty was placed upon Genet 's head . Bellowing the " Marseillaise " at us , he then passed the hat around the table . For a moment each of us put it on while Philip Freneau led the singing of a hymn he had himself composed extolling the rights of man and uneasily set to the tune of " God Save the King . " The usually glum Monroe was delighted with the evening . As we left Oeller 's together , he said , " I should like to be in the room tomorrow when Hamilton and the President get their report on what happened to-night . " Monroe looked almost gleeful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Jefferson presents Genet to His Mightiness . " We were just opposite Ricketts ' Circus when a half-dozen villainouslookingFrench sailors leapt at us from a darkened alley , knives drawn . " You English ! " one of them shouted . While another placed a knife at my throat . " We kill all English . " " You kill an American senator , " I spoke in French , " and you will be hanged . " " You speak French like an Englishman ! " One of the sailors reached for my watch fob . Just at that moment , luckily for us , a group from the Oeller 's dinner approached , and the sailors ran off . Monroe and I were both shaken , and angry . I wanted to have the men arrested . We were fairly certain that they were from the Embuscade which was docked at the Market Street wharf . " No . " Monroe was more cautious than I. " We must say nothing . We must not play into I lamilton 's hands . " So we said nothing.  |p172That  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause of France 's revolution suffered accordingly . French sailors in unholy combination with refugees from Santo Domingo ( ousted by their Negro slaves ) preyed on the people of Philadelphia in the name of liberty . At one point it looked as if the bandits , in league with a number of native malcontents , might overturn the government and chop off Washington 's head . Though the danger of this was never as great as Hamilton and Adams pretended , Genet did manage to shadow the President 's popularityamongst the lower orders to such a degree that His Mightiness was often  --  unthinkable lese-majeste  --  booed at the theatre and in the streets . Knowing the high almost sacred regard Washington had for himself , it must be said that he handled , with admirable restraint , not only Genet but himself , allowing the cockerel to destroy itself . I MET MR . DAVIS BY CHANCE in the lobby of the City Hotel where I . had been waiting , vainly as it turned out , for a client of the firm to appear and pay his bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have received no salary for two months . As a result , Mrs. Townsend has not seen me in a month . Mr. Davis asked me into the tap-room where we were served a rum concoction by the bar-tender who works in a sort of cage . In the afternoon the bar of the City Hotel is like a club with certain tables always occupied by the same men . I must say I enjoy the smoky room 's air of opulence and mystery as large prosperous men whisper together of money , the low murmur of their talk sharply punctuated at regular intervals by the sound of the bar-tender 's hammer breaking ice . Mr. Davis knew half the room , and was greeted warmly . The other half presumably know him , but pretend not to . Political divisions are particularly bitter since the riots in April . " We 're going to win , Charlie . No doubt of it . " Mr. I ) avis leered at me through spectacles that magnify large honest eyes , but then all eyesp173magnified look honest . I would not trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You 'll be contributing your bit , wo n't you ? " I was mystified , and showed it , as always . I could never be a conspirator ; and begin to wonder if I can ever be a proper lawyer . " We 're looking forward to your little book . " Mr. Davis winked at me . Before I could ask him just what he meant , whether or not he knew of my arrangement with Leggett , he changed the subject . After much admiring talk of Henry Clay whom he affects to know well and thinks to be in the true line of Jefferson , I asked him suddenly , " When did Jefferson first fall out with Colonel Burr ? " " The election of 1792 . " I realized then that Colonel Burr 's narrative  --  seemingly so ample  --  had discreetly omitted the events of 1792 when George Washington and John Adams were re-elected president and vice-president , and John Jay was defeated by George Clinton for governor of New York . " The state  --  the country  --  was bank-mad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election time , there was a depression . Hamilton 's friend Duer went bankrupt , and to jail . The Federalists were in despair . Many wanted Burr to be their candidate . Hamilton put a stop to that . He persuaded John Jay , the chief justice , to make the race . He did and almost won . " " With the help of Tammany ? " " We had no help to give . We were still a fraternal order . I do n't suppose twenty braves were committeemen in that election and they were pretty evenly divided between Clinton and Jay . " Nelson Chase entered the bar . Saw me . Paused . Then came over to our table . " I have a message for Colonel Burr . Could you tell me where he is stopping ? " I was not about to tell him that the Colonel is currently in the Bowery with Aaron Columbus Burr . " Jersey City , " I said . Nelson Chase thanked me , and departed . Mr. Davis nodded ; enjoyed the lie . Then continued : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only one year in the Senate , he was regarded by many Republicans as a future president . It was Jefferson 's plan to undermine Adams as vice-president . Washington would be re-elected unanimously but Adams must be defeated , or at least diminished . To Jefferson 's amazement , votes began to accumulate for Colonel Burr and votes for Jefferson did not materialise . Finally , a meeting was held in which the Republican leadership , directed by Jefferson , persuaded Burr to give up his votes to Governor Clinton with the understanding that in 1796 Burr would be our vice-presidential candidate .
