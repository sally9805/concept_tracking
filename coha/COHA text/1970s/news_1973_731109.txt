Agnew asked Maryland 's judiciary today to sus , pend rather than disbar him , giving him a second chance at the practice of law  --  a chance , he said , to " resume a useful place " and , perhaps , " attemp to bring . credit " on his stat and his profession . He made his plea before panel of three judges in th county court house here , short ly after lawyers from the Mary land State Bar Association ha told the panel that the forme Vice President should be dis barred because of his convictio last October for tax evasion . His voice cracking , his fac lined and looking tired , Mr. Agnew told the judges that temporary suspension fro practice would be sanctio enough . " I would conduct myself i a way that would not bring dis credit upon the bar , or the ! raga profession or the courts , " h promised . The panel of judges , afn pointed by the Maryland Cou4 of ' Appeals to hold a disciple nary hearing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cessed the hearing after MT . Agnew spoke and promised ruling as " expeditiously " possible . AGNEW IS SEEKING BAR SUSPENSION // years in public office . It was made public as part of the agreement under which Mr. Agnew was charged with only one count and allowed to plead no contest rather than guilty . Mr. Agnew 's lawyers argued ? that the summary  --  which is in great demand by schools and libraries , according to the clerk of the Baltimore court  --  was irrelevant in that it concerned matters for which Mr. Agnew was not formally charged . A plea of no contest results In a " conviction , " and under state law , conviction of a felony is grounds for disbarment . Today 's hearing was scheduled after the Maryland State Bar . Association petitioned the Maryland Court of Appeals to take " disciplinary " action ' against Mr. Agnew because of ' that conviction . The court could dismiss the case , reprimand Mr. Agnew , suspend him or disbar him . And until today , the bar association had not suggested which option @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bar association , Alfred Scanlan , did not make that recommendation until after he had finished his argument in favor of the associaton 's re , quest for a disciplinary proceeding . And he made the recommendation , he said , only because he had been told in a ' pre-trial conference that the judges wanted to know what the bar association wanted done about Mr. Agnew But his argument had made clear , even before he called for disbarment , that the association wanted a stiff sanction . Mr. Agnew , in evading taxes , had committed a crime of " moral turpitude , " Mr. Scanlan said . The income that the former Vice President had failed to report was " suspicious , " the lawyer went on . On top of that , , he said , Mr. Agnew was not just a lawyer but also a public official . And the public , he said , was coming to distrust the legal profession . Mr. Agnew 's lawyers did not ask the panel to recommend that the bar association charges be dismissed . " There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jr. , one of Mr. Agnew 's lawyers , told the court . Nor did they ask for a simple reprimand . Going a Little Far ' Nor did they contest the description of Mr. Agnew 's tax evasion as a crime of moral turpitude . But they rejected the bar association 's call for disbarment , arguing that the usual sanction in such cases was suspension and that the bar association , in seeking disbarment , was " going a little far " and acting prosecutorial . They also argued that the only misbehavior before the judges was the single count of tax evasion , and that Mr. Agnew 's conviction on this count did not indicate that he could not be a proper lawyer . This crime was committed while Mr. Agnew was working as a Government official rather than as a lawyer , said Mr. Pierson ; the former Vice President , he went on , was thus " a man who has done nothing wrong insofar as his clients are concerned . " Mr. Agnew 's appearance attracted a crowd that filled the two-story courtroom .
