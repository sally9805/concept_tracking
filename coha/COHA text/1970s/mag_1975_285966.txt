For Western chic , this is the year of the coolie who came in from the cold . Starting last spring , when the first Chinese-inspired fashions swept Paris , European and American designers have been having a collective field day redecorating workers ' uniforms and baggy pants , overblouses and quilted jackets . The style might be called Mao a la mode . Now , with the fall collections , American couturiers have gone from paddy to palace , digging deep into the treasure chest of Imperial China . Result : high-collared mandarin robes , silk jacquard jackets , sable-lined evening coats of old damask and golden-scrolled pajamas , all done up in poesies of color pirated from the Orient ( see color opposite ) . <P> Why the Chinese Look ? The reopening of East-West trade was a major impetus . Commune-style jackets imported from the People 's Republic caught the fancy of the young in Paris two years ago as an alternative to the standard jeans and T shirts . " For the past ten years in the West , the fashion emphasis has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary McFadden . " We had to have some resurrection of beautiful fabric and fantasy , and when you go to fantasy you must go ethnic . " <P> This is by no means the first appearance of a Chinese look . Nor is the look exclusively Chinese ; the fashion embraces ideas and accents from almost anywhere east of Suez . Designer McFadden 's opulent coats are batiked and hand-painted in Java , and other items in her collection speak variously of Japan , Mongolia and the Middle East . The style , says another American designer , Jonathan Hitchcock , " includes anything Eastern-Tibetan , Persian , Indian . It is a much more primitive way of making clothes-simple and functional yet sophisticated . " And versatile . Fashions like Hitchcock 's side-wrapped , hip-length " Tibetan " jacket can be worn year-round . Moreover , the less extreme Chinese fashions seem unlikely to go out of style . The look , says Joan Sibley , of Sibley &; Coffee , a Manhattan design firm , " is elegant and classic . It is not really a fad . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helped start fashion 's current Orient Express rolling last spring , concentrated at first on supple , sensuous clothes with a low hip line . The Japanese-born Kenzo noted that his styles " had affinities with the Chinese look , so we carried on the Chinese line . " Among the first U.S. designers to introduce proletarian posh was Cinnamon Wear 's Britta , whose workers ' drop-shouldered jackets and raincoats flopped like wet rice when they came out last year ; now the firm has trouble keeping up with demand . <P> Today the designer who has most faithfully interpreted classic Chinese styles is a Cuban-born American : Adolfo . His fall collection is heavy on crocheted pajamas and slim , high-collared cheongsam dresses in clingy silk knits with side buttoning and frog fasteners down the front . The look , Adolfo allows , " is very sexy . It is cut to show the fanny , and if you have a little tummy , it shows that too . Men like it very much . " So does the Duchess of Windsor , who was carried away by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
