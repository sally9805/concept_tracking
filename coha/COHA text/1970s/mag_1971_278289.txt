There has been no big medical emergency in Vinton County , Ohio , recently-no epidemics , no multiple accidents . Still , the 10,000 residents have been apprehensive . In February their doctor and neighbor of 22 years , Richard Bullock , left abruptly . No other physician lives or practices in the county seat of McArthur , and the closest hospital is 25 miles away . At last , an intensive search for a new general practitioner has succeeded ; a new doctor will soon be at the consulting room desk on which Bullock left his stethoscope nine months ago . <P> Though the people now feel a sense of relief , the pressures that drove Bullock away will still be present . Vinton 's problem since February has been typical of some 2,000 rural counties and towns now without doctors , just as Bullock 's burden was representative of that borne by thousands of physicians who struggle to maintain one-man country practices . <P> Patient on Call . In 1948 , when Bullock first came to McArthur , there were three other doctors to help meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death or departure of his colleagues had left him the sole physician . Vacations , even days off , became luxuries beyond his reach . " I had office hours six days a week , " he recalls now , " but there was n't a Sunday I did n't have to go into the office for one thing or another . " Bullock attempted to give up work at the hospital , which consumed a large part of his time , only to discover that he could not practice the kind of medicine he wished without operating . " Surgery and obstetrics were important to me personally , not just my patients . And besides , I 'd never know just what happened to them in the hospital if I was n't there , so I had to do it the old way . " <P> Office appointments stacked up until they sometimes reached an impossible 50 a day . To avoid having patients wait in vain for several hours , he often had those who needed just a routine checkup wait at home . Then he would summon them-occasionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He knew that he had too many patients and admits now : " I was n't strong enough to say no . " Nor was he able to find a colleague to share the practice . <P> Broken Marriage . Bullock 's medical monopoly did not bring him large financial rewards . " My income was static for almost 20 years , " he says . The charge for a typical office visit was $4 , including medication that he prepared himself . Some of his patients say that he was lax about collecting bills . <P> Bullock 's routine , which left him scant time for his wife and five sons , contributed to the breakup of his marriage . Finally , the pressure proved too much for him . In late January , he bought space in the county newspaper to announce that at the age of 53 he was closing down his practice . Three weeks later , he became a 9-to-5 clinic physician at Virginia Polytechnic Institute in Blacksburg , Va . " I could n't go on like I was , " he recalls . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
