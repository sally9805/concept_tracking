txt Governor Carey proposed an $11.345 billion New York State budget . today that calls for major cuts in ? welfare and Medicaid , along with a revised formula that would reduce local school aid to many districts . The $350 million package of cuts was sweetened by a call for an end to the income tax surcharge and for " a. small but permanent reduction in income taxes for families making less than $20,000 a year . The budget also calls for an extension of the 20 percent surcharge , on corporate franchise taxes and 30 percent surcharge on . banks . Total state spending would increase by $324 million , the smallest rise in more than a decade . Source of New Funds Mr. Carey expects the spending rise and the loss of revenues from the income tax to be offset by the bank and corporate tax surcharges and the normal growth in revenues from other taxes . Mr. Carey touted the complex budget proposal as a plan for " a year of stabilization " and " the year of the taxpayer . " Perhaps the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its warp of tax cuts and extensions and its woof of program cuts , is an ambitious attempt to reverse long-standing patterns in:localassistance formulas . The major elements in the Governor 's budget , message were : CiFor New York . City , $68 million extra that was not . expected for the next fiscal year . This , includes an increase , of about $40 million for the City University of New York . However , Mayor ? Beante 'S office says the state 's calculations ' are " soft . " 9A $200 million cut in welfare and Medicaid payments , including ' a ' 45-day limit on payments to childless employable , persons on home relief . 9A new school-aid ' formula- that cuts $150 million from the current aid levels but offers $170 million to offset the cuts in a package of both money and anticipated savings . Not all districts , however , qualify for all the offsetting cuts . The Governor said his budget . was the first to propose as an explicit objective that there be no ' further tax- increases at either the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , state-aid formulas will be designed not to encourage local Carey 's 1977-78 Budget Calls for Major Welfare Cuts and Some Reductions in Taxes // spending , but to limit it , " he said . " For the ? first time , the state will seek to relieve localities of mandates and not add new ones . " Mr. Carey . has been laying the groundwork for reducing local aid at preliminary briefings , during which he emphasized what he called the disproportionate growth in local spending . But that growth has been fueled by a series of state-mandated spending programs . For example , home relief is a unique form of supplementary welfare financed by New York State and the towns , and Medicaid assistance ? is broader in New York than in any other state . Mr : Carey also proposed a cap on revenue sharing , which means that towns will get the same amount of money in the next fiscal year as they get this year . Last year , Mr. Carey 's " austerity budget " " was attacked by Republicans as " a declaration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , lower-income citizens will take , the brunt of the cuts . Although Republican leaders immediately criticized some-of the Governor 's arithmetic , asserting , .. that net cost reductions were lower than the Governor was claiming , the overall reaction was subdued rather than outraged . However , there are already some indications that Mr. Carey nItiV have trouble getting his proposed extension of corporate and bank surcharges through the Legislature , and his school-did revisions are expected to be controversial . As for tax cuts , the Income-tax surcharge , originally imposed for a five-year period , was due to expire at the end of this fiscal year anyway . For a family of four earning $20,000 , the elimination of the surcharge is worth $23 . The sliding scale income-tax credits proposed by Mr. Carey range from a $50 credit for a single person with an income of $3,650 to $5 for a family making just under $20,000 . If passed , it would be , the first time there had ever been a reduction in the state income tax . Key Element in Package Mr. Carey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not hurting " those least able to afford it . " He said he had resisted proposals for flat reductions in grants for welfare recipients . The most - important income - maintenance reductions proposed by Mr. Carey in his total savings package of $83 million in this area are to : taimit home relief assistance benefits for employable single people and childless couples , and provide limited employment assistance . gReduce the maximum amounts permitted for shelter costs , in- some cases by as much as 13 percent . cPeriodically verify the eligibility of public-assistance recipients and remove ineligibles . He also proposed reducing special-need grants , eliminating aliens from assistance programs and trying to shift home-relief clients to the federally supported Supplementary Security Income program . In Medicaid , the Governor proposed measures that he said would limit the state 's spending to $832.8 million in the next fiscal year , a small increase . The most important changes were : IThe removal from Medicaid coverage of services by podiatrists and chiropractors , and restricted coverage only for physical and occupational therapists , speech pathologists and private-duty nurses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CA 10 percent reduction in clinic rates and modifications in other rate schedules , and absorption of the program of state support for ambulatory patients into Medicaid reimbursement for outpatient services . Mr. Carey 's school-aid proposals are close to those made in November by the State Board of Regents , but would cost less . The program is designed both to equalize per-pupil spending regardless of the property wealth of the school district and to encourage localities to hold down school taxes . To determine state aid , the new formula ' would be based on average daily " membership , " taking into account both attendance and enrollment . Reduction Is Offset The formula represents a compromise in the old struggle between using . attendance , which favors upstate districts , or enrollment , which favors New York City . Since the current formula is based entirely on attendance , this change benefits the city .

The plan calls for a reduction of $150 million in the aid program for elementary and secondary schools , which is to be offset by a package of $170 million , which would help some localities more than others . The $170 million is composed both of actual appropriations and of money the Governor says the school districts can save by taking various measures . " Disincentive ' Plan In order to provide what he called a " disincentive " to local school tax increases , Mr. Carey proposed that a district that limited increases in per-pupil costs to acceptable levels in 1977-1978 would receive state-aid increases in operating aid in 1978-79 . To receive state funds , districts would have to limit their increased costs from between 2 percent ( for high expense districts ) to 6.6 percent ( for low expense districts . ) If a district meets these criteria , it would be guaranteed state-aid increases the next year . A district that did not do so would be assumed to have enough local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Governor also proposed a $41 million cut in the Tuition Assistance Pro . ' gram ; the college-level state scholarship program that has been widely criticized for being too permissive . A minor , but not unusual , example of the kinds of state mandates that can drive up local spending was listed in the budget message under the heading " Dog Census Requirement . " The passage said : " Municipalities are required to appoint special enumerators to prepare an annual census of dogs . The Department of Agriculture and Markets indicates that this house-to-house dog census has been neither an effective mechanism for ensuring that animals are registered nor always necessary . " The Governor proposed to make the canine census voluntary rather than mandatory , which is likely to provoke opposition from the dog enumerators of New York . Mr. Carey 's budget message proposed A number of such changes in state mandates , some of which are merely impose ing requirements , while others mpose a substantial burden on the localities . Significant Increases He pledged a further review and analysis of existing mandates for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ review each new legislative proposal , agency rule and regulation to determine its effect on local government spending . The most significant Increases proposed by the Governor for state agencies were for the Department of Corrections ( $32 million more ) , the Department of Mental Hygiene ( up $38.8 million ) and the Department of Social Services ( $24 million more ) . The budget sets aside $53 million for state employees ' salary Increases . Mr. Carey 's proposal to continue the corporate and bank surcharges was accompanied by a proposal to eliminate a tax deduction enjoyed by the banks . The revenue from the bank surcharge was markedly smaller than anticipated this year , because the banks took advantage of a tax deduction that permitted them to write off bad loans against their tax liability . Perry . B. Duryea Jr. , Republican of Montauk , L.I. , and minority leader of the Assembly , pronounced the Governor 's budget message " a bitter disappointment . " He said its promise of $200 million tax cut ( in income taxes ) was actually a $300 million tax increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Indications of economies in the existing costs of goy- , ernment largely evaporate into a sea of fiscal legerdemain , " Mr. Duryea said . ' While Mr. Duryea was predictably unimpressed by the budget , most legislators seemed to regard the budget with ' a mixture of resignation and caution . Warren M. Anderson , Republican of Binghamton and majority leader of the Senate , had no comment at all .
