In biblical times when the country was called Mesopotamia , the name became almost a synonym for a rich and fertile land , blessed by nature . Now the place is called Iraq . It is an oven-hot , barren landscape with a population of 9,750,000 and only one significant natural resource : oil . But today 's energy-hungry technology has made Iraq 's expansive oilfields the focus for half the world 's attention . <P> Two weeks ago , in response to that attention , Iraq 's zealously left-wing government nationalized some of the Western-owned oilfields . In the capital city of Baghdad , crowds cheered the militancy of President Ahmed Hassan Bakr ; in Moscow , Izvestia hailed him as the Arab of the hour . For all their intoxicating dose of nationalism , the Iraqis now faced the practical problem of pumping and selling their oil , which amounts to 10% of the Middle East 's total . Perhaps their great friends , the Soviets , could help ? <P> Foreign Minister Abdul Baki flew to Moscow and huddled with Premier Aleksei Kosygin and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Russians and Iraqis had decided to negotiate bilateral economic agreements , but they failed to announce what Iraq wants : an oil deal . In Paris the French Cabinet considered , but did not immediately accept , Iraq 's offer of a special arrangement with the French company that is part owner of the oilfields . Beirut newspapers began carrying front-page ads offering Iraqi oil at " realistic and competitive prices . " <P> Iraq was in trouble . About two-thirds of Baghdad 's budget comes from oil . By seizing the assets of the Iraq Petroleum Co . ( IPC ) , worth an estimated $500 million , Bakr &; Co. endangered the bulk of their future revenues . Now the government must produce and market oil in the face of legal threats from one of the world 's most powerful consortiums , IPC , which is owned by Standard Oil ( New Jersey ) , Mobil , Royal Dutch/Shell , British Petroleum , Compagnie Franchise des Petroles and minority investors . The four senior partners are influential enough to block sales of Iraqi crude to other major oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law to sequester cargoes of " stolen " Iraqi oil . British Petroleum has already seized tankers carrying oil from its wells in Libya , which were nationalized earlier this year . <P> Growing Hostility . IPC 's row with Baghdad has been long simmering . A decade ago , Iraq took over some of IPC 's concessions ; since then it has drilled for oil with Soviet help and become increasingly hostile to the international consortium . Last year , relations were rubbed raw by a slowdown in the growth of world demand for oil . In Iraq 's northern fields-the ones now nationalized-IPC cut production by 11% ; but in the southern fields , nearer to Persian Gulf shipping points , it raised output by 74% . Despite the fact that Iraq 's revenues rose 64% to $909 million , the Baghdad government was miffed by the new arrangement . It insisted that the cuts in the north were IPC 's retaliation for the loss of concessions a decade earlier .                   @ @
