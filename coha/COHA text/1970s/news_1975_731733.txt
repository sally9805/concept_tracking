txt " When I walked in here , " the bank client said , " I thought you 'd painted the place . It looked different . " The change was not paint . It was clothes . The bank had put its tellers into standardized , color-coordinated clothing , known in the garment trade as " care &; apparel . " Seven years ago hardly anyone except airline stewardesses wore matching sets of interchangeable skirts , dresses , jackets , and trousers . Now every work day some 500,000 people wear them . They include employees of insurance companies , retail stores , fast food chains , public utilities , hotels , motels , and car dealerships as well as salesmen , police dispatchers , and even formerly forbidding undertakers seeking a " softer look . " " There 's certainly a trend in this country toward more people wearing coordinated garments , " says Howard Wolfe , executive secretary of the National Association of Uniform Manufacturers . // * What to wear // Four years ago manufacturers such as Du Pont and Celanese were predicting that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans would be wearing what amounts to white-collar work clothes . With the blue-collar uniform business now exceeding $1 billion each year ( sales are growing 10 percent annually ) , their optimism was understandable . Coping with fads Even though the career apparel market has not grown quite so dramatically as they hoped , present projections still suggest that 1.5 million workers will be wearing it in 1980 . Annual career apparel sales , now about $75 million , are expected to triple . But even these estimates may prove too optimistic . Some firms have entered career apparel programs only to drop them later due to cost , personnel turnover , or problems of getting employees to wear the clothing to work . Mr. Wolfe cites a number of reasons for the swing toward career clothing . " It 's one way to cope with minis and maxis and other dress fads , " he notes . " It also has utilitarian and image functions . " " I think it 's primarily a wish for uniform good taste , " says designer Renie Conley , " and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airline stewardessing , career apparel means glamour to some of its wearers . But the businessman regards it pragmatically . Career clothes allow him to control how his people look on the job and help customers identify employees quickly . They can aid in-house security as well . To combat high employee pilferage , says Mr. Wolfe , a small company distributing consumer products has recently altered its career clothes program in order to color-code employees according to their work locations . Introducing career apparel to employees must be done with great tact . Some resent being " matched to the furnishings " while others distrust the prospect of increased regimentation . Letting employees have some say in the choice of styles often helps . Sometimes , Mrs. Conley says , she has had to work hard to overcome objections to standardized apparel , explaining style points and convincing employees that they can wear it attractively . But the boss has the ? final word . Whether or not the apparel pleases employees , comments Mrs. Conley , " It 's got to please the man at the top . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
