txt Letters Letters Public and Private Colleges : the Tuition Gap To the Editor : Your March 27 news article " Tuition Rise Checked at Public Colleges " tends to perpetuate a misleading set of impressions as to the management of American higher education . The opening paragraph captures neatly the tendency to confuse price and cost , to the potentially tragic disadvantage of the private sector : " The battle to hold the line on soaring tuition has apparently been won , at least for next fall , by the nation 's public colleges , but most private ones will again be ' raising their tuition . " Nothing is factually wrong in that statement , but the impression left is that somehow the publicly supported institutions are managing to save people 's money while the private sector is back at the public trough , asking for more . The fact is , of course , that costs are continuing to rise , at a rate more rapid than that of the cost of living generally , in both publicly and privately supported colleges and universities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay for this cost rise . Those who pay tuitions are well aware of what they are thus contributing ; the taxpayers , who provide the ever-mounting subsidies whereby , the public institutions manage " to hold the line on soaring tuition , " are far less aware . I would not object to further victories over soaring tuition in the public sector if I thought the nation was facing honestly the question of whether it wishes to maintain a healthy independent sector to compete with ( and , for that matter , cooperate with ) the publics . We do not object to competing at some disadvantage , but sooner or later there will come a time at which the disadvantage stemming from our relative lack of subsidization will be too great for us to withstand . The country will then get a single taxsupported system , without ever having consciously willed that this should happen . Writing about the . financial issues of higher education in the manner of The Times March 27th article can only contribute to the obfuscation ? and the unintended consequences . RICHARD W @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ March 31 , 1977 0 To the Editor : Your recent report ( March 27 ) on the differences in tuitions across the nation overlooked a growing problem in New York State that is partly educational and partly fiscal . The gap continues to grow between tuition charged students at State University/City University ( $750 to $900 a year ) and tuition charges at independent campuses ( averaging $3,000 a year ) . At the same time , overall enrollment is facing a sharp drop-off . Not only does this jeopardize the academic viability of many independent campuses , it poses a large fiscal threat to New York 's taxpayers . It costs New York over $4,000 a'year in tax levy funds to support a student at SUNY and almost $3,000 a year at CUNY . In contrast , the taxpayers provide about $600 a year for each student enrolled at an independent college or university . Today the income and ethnic mix among students at State University four-year colleges and those in the independent sector is virtually indistinguishable . But continued tuition escalation , forced upon the independents by inflation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go broke . To deal with the tuition gap , hold down tax levy expenditures , and permit New York students institutional choices across sectors , the State Legislature enacted the Tuition Assistance Program ( TAP ) in 1974 . While grants have increased to reflect tuition rises at SUNY , TAP has failed to , adjust to the even larger tuition increases charged independent sector students . Next fall there will be no tuition boost at SUNY/CUNY , but the independent campus average tuition will be forced upward another $300 . Rather than adjusting TAP to reflect the realities of inflation , the new state budget actually reduces awards for a large number of single emancipated students enrolled at independent institutions . Many of these and other students will be forced to either drop out of . higher education or switch to government universities where the cost to the taxpayers is many times higher . Before the 1977 Legislature adjourns , there is time to repair the glaring defects in the TAP Law . If it is not done , at minimum cost in tax levy funds , higher educational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expenditures will continue to increase . HENRY D. PALEY Albany , March 29 , 1977 The writer is president of the Commission on Independent Colleges and Universities . Of India , Moynihan And the New Envoy U.S. Foreign Policy Diagram To the Editor : Sentence : Brazil , Argentina ( and South Korea ) are violators of human rights . South Korea is an understood subject that need not be included , BUT Are other parts of the world subjects , actors , predicate words , or receivers of the action ? GEORGE L. KAISER Chairman , English Department Kittatinny Regional High School Newton , N.J. ; March 23 , 1977 In Lieu of Commodity Stockpiling To the Editor : Few people would disagree with the underlying sentiment in your recent editorial , " Braking the Commodity Roller Coaster , " that the developing nations , because of their oil import bills , need more help than ever . But to conclude that the U.S. should put its financial support behind commodity stockpiling is to belie most of the points made earlier in the editorial . First of all , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and inflationary  --  and considerably above UNCTAD 's $3 billion figure for ten major commodities . A stockpile of a million tons of copper , for example ( which would seem to be the absolute minimum required ) , would cost over $1.5 billion at today 's low prices . Additionally , as the editorial itself points out , such agreements have rarely worked in the past . Is aid so easy to come by  --  politically or economically  --  in today 's world that we can allocate in the neighborhood of $10 billion for a project that is not likely to work ? More Importantly , the " poor nations , " which you suggest would be helped , would in almost all cases be the richest L.D.C 's . By contrast , the truly poor nations would find themselves not only paying more for oil but for most everything else as well . Just to cite the three commodities you picked as " prime candidates " ? cocoa , tin and rubber ? the principal beneficiaries would be Brazil , Ecuador , Ghana , the Ivory Coast , Nigeria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Nigeria and Indonesia are in OPEC , and Brazil and Malaysia could almost be classified as developed , at least in comparison to the vast majority of other L.D.C . ' s . Furthermore , to the extent that income in these richer L.D.C . ' s would be increased , it could be expected that their resulting rise in consumption would most benefit the 0 . E.C.D. cbuntries  --  and leave the truly poor . even further isolated . A more sensible approach is to provide financial assistance on a sliding scale to those poorer L.D.C . ' s primarily with single-export economies , for which price fluctuations produce serious economic disruption . At the same time , there are methods within the free market system to minimize price fluctuations at a fraction of the cost of stockpiling large amounts of various commodities . For example , the commodity futures market , as the American cotton producer and grain dealer has known for decades , can help ' absorb price variations caused by seasonal distortions , weather disasters , and the like . If , for example , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crop forward during the fall of 1974 , to take advantage of the rising price , the price would not have risen as high nor would it have fallen so far so fast  --  in short , it would have been relatively more stable . The futures market Is not a perfect mechanism , but as more and more L.D.C . ' s are learning , it is a useful financial tool in both the marketing and the importing of commodities . And it has the added advantages of not interfering with the fundamental supply and demand equilibrium nor of absorbing billions of dollars that otherwise might be more productively employed for the truly poor among the L.D.C .

MCADAMS DEFORD New York , March 29 , 1977 Bonds of Yonkers To the Editor : Your March 29 letters columns contained a communication from Don Wharton proposing the purchase of New York City bonds redeemable in lieu of real property taxes .

Because of the large volume of mail received , we regret that we are unable to acknowledge or to return unpublished letters . To the Editor : The Times 's recent photograph of Mr. Moynihan preparing a Senate resolution to congratulate the Indian peopiii on the outcome of the recent election is surely ironic . Only a few weeks ago , this ex-Ambassador to India had . delivered himself , in a Playboy interview , of the sentiment that he ( and therefore the American people , of course ) had lost interest in India because of the demise of Indian democracy and that , therefore , India had nothing left to export except " communicable diseases . " Aside from what this episode tells us about Mr. Moynihan himself , there is a moral here , which has a bearing on President Carter 's choice of an ambassador to India @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be seized . The bitterness that is apparent in Mr. Moynihan 's Playboy outburst surely stems from the ego that he brought to his assignment in New . Delhi , which the Indian intellectuals and policy-makers would not appease ( especially in the post-Bangladesh strained relations between India and the United States ) . Indians respect eminence ; give us a , Samuelson or Einstein any time . But we do not so respect prominence , which , in any event , is strictly a parochial , home-based affair . Mr. Galbraith managed to live with this intolerable situation because , as his " Journal " amply shows , lie never really realized that he was in India . But Mr. Moyni.han felt his ego , both direct and as a presumably vice-regal emissary of a great nation , badly bruised , and he never recovered from this slight .. President Carter 's choice of Robert Goheen , an eminent scholar not given to self-indulgence , as the new Ambassador-to India is therefore thoroughly appropriate . It promises a return to the marvelous Chester Bowles era . JAGDISH BHAGWATI , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7 , 1977 The writers are professors of economics . The Clear-Headed.Guests To the Editor : In an unpleasant , uncalled-for attack on Rosalynn Carter ( letter March 24 ) a New York woman complains about the trivialities of Mrs. Carter 's hospitality ( Amy and her book ) but ignores her natural Southern graciousness . We should all rejoice that In Washington , a city that runs on alcohol , we have a First Lady who enjoys " the adult pleasure of presiding over a really fine dinner party " with clear-headed guests who do not have to do obeisance to the eternal Washington cocktail .
