txt Attention is focused on former Sen. Eugene McCarthy in the Illinois Democratic primary on Tuesday : Can he blunt the already-slowed Edmund Muskte drtve ? Here is a look at McCarthy on the stump . If you like your politics wry , the Eugene McCarthy campaign will be your dish . Leaving a shopping mall where people had fairly purred over his presence , the tall , graying former U.S. senator tapped an aide on the shoulder and asked , " How do you think I did ? " When the assistant answered , " Very well , " Mr. McCarthy quipped , " Yes , if I were campaigning against me , I 'd be worried . " In Illinois , Mr. McCarthy is campaigning against Edmund S. Muskie , and much could depend on the outcome . Mr. McCarthy is out to deliver a final blow to Senator Muskie , who in Mr. McCarthy 's mind represents a return of the old , discredited politics to the Democratic Party . Both men are campaigning hard ? in their different styles . About Muskie . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Muskie admits he was wrong about the war and is asking our forgiveness . It would seem logical that he would forgive those who were right about the war . " Of the continuing talk that Senator Muskie looks like Abraham Lincoln , poet McCarthy said , " Lincoln actually had four poems published . I may have to use this in Illinois . " Out in his limousine , en route to the north side after a church rally of blacks on the // *Lincoln was a poet , too // south side , Mr. McCarthy turned his own peculiar kind of wit ? sometimes a little cutting ? on the race , itself . " If I lose badly , " he said , " I may decide that I will have to continue on , just to vindicate myself . Or , again , I may decide that the result is so bad I just better get out of town . I 'm like you reporters . I can take the same set of figures and come up with varying interpretations . " About here , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him on the back seat . " She said yesterday she 's going to support me after all , " said Mr. McCarthy with a smile . " Her reason was that she thought the others were so awful . " Miss McCarthy shrugged her shoulders as if to say , " What can you do with a father like that ? " ' New ' McCarthy ? Someone mentioned a magazine article on the " new " McCarthy , The candidate had liked the piece but said he was certain there was no change , regeneration , or new birth on his part . This seemed a fair judgment . He was , indeed , the same Gene McCarthy who had come out from hiding in the snow-covered bushes of New Hampshire four years ago to hand President Johnson a surprise thumping heard round the world . The dark-gray business suit was the same . So were the plain , black shoes and the narrowish , nondescript tie and white shirt . The hair might be a little gra er . But that was all . What was different to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somber , even cynical mood during the late stages of hisunsuccessful bid for the nomination in 1968 was Mr. McCarthy 's broad and easy smile and confident gait . But it was n't new . It was the 1968 McCarthy of New Hampshire , Indiana , Wisconsin , Oregon , and California . It was the McCarthy before he became fatigued , embittered , frustrated , and deeply depressed over what he felt was a take-over of the old politics at the Democratic convention and thereafter in the campaign . What was new was that the old McCarthy was back . Sanguine ? Yes . . . " Could we say that you are sanguine ? " we asked . Mr. McCarthy grinned . " Sanguine , " he said , rolling the word over his tongue and obviously liking the taste . " Sanguine . That 's an interesting word . Yes , I guess so . " Mr. McCarthy likes to explain why the famous auto failure , the Edsel , was created by the Ford Motor Company . The explanation provides some insights into how he views his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much an underdog as he was four years ago ? and where he might be able to do almost as much damage , if he wins . " The Edsel , " he told one audience , " was supposed to be for the man on his way up and did n't know whether he would make it . It was also for the man on the way down and did n't know where he would land . And it was also for the man in between who did n't know where he was . " Mr. McCarthy thinks there is no way for him to go except upward in Illinois . He obviously believes he 's riding no Edsel as he campaigns through this state .
