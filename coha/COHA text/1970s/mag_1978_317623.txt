Feminine but forceful , Phyllis Schlafly is a very liberated woman <P> Looking crisp and composed in a red shirtwaist dress , red-white-and-blue scarf and frosted hair , Phyllis Schlafly arrived last week at the Illinois capitol with 500 followers . To symbolize their opposition to the Equal Rights Amendment , which was about to be voted on in the house , the women had brought loaves of home-baked bread-apricot , date nut , honey-bran and pumpkin . But as she climbed onto a kitchen stool to address the cheering crowd , Schlafly the demure housewife turned into Schlafly the aggressive polemicist . The passage of ERA , she declared , would mean Government-funded abortions , homosexual schoolteachers , women forced into military combat and men refusing to support their wives . <P> For the past six years , Schlafly , 53 , has been delivering similar exhortations to similar gatherings , helping to turn public opinion against ERA , which is still three states short of ratification . After passing 35 state legislatures in five years , ERA was defeated last year in Nevada , North Carolina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once again in Illinois when the house narrowly defeated it . With no other state legislature scheduled to vote on ERA , the amendment will expire on March 22 , 1979 unless Congress agrees to extend the deadline . <P> ERA 'S decline has been largely the result of Schlafly 's small ( 20,000 members ) but highly disciplined organizations , Stop ERA and Eagle Forum . While the feminists have splintered over the issues of abortion and lesbian rights , Schlafly 's troops have centered their efforts on ERA . They have evolved into a formidable lobbying force , allied with local and national right-wing groups , including HOW ( Happiness of Women ) and AWARE ( American Women Are Richly Endowed ) . <P> Flying from state capital to state cap ital , the savvy , disarming Schlafly matches the feminists ' rhetoric phrase for phrase . She bluntly proclaims that " all sensible people are against ERA , " and dismisses the liberationists as " a bunch of bitter women seeking a constitutional cure for their personal problems . " In many of her speeches , she continues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home with their family . " <P> Schlafly , however , is hardly a typical housewife . Author of nine books , a three-time candidate for the U.S. Congress , full-time law student at Washington University in St. Louis , editor of a monthly newsletter , twice-a-week syndicated newspaper columnist and regular speaker at anti-ERA rallies , she acts very much like a liberated woman . By her own reckoning , she is away from her family at least once a week . She employs a full-time housekeeper to care for her six-bedroom Tudor-style mansion overlooking the Mississippi River in Alton , 111 . <P> How does Schlafly reconcile her career with her stay-at-home dogma ? " My husband lets me do what I want to do , " she says . " I have canceled speeches whenever my husband thought that I had been away from home too much . " Besides , she adds , " when I fill out applications , I put down ' mother ' as my occupation . " She boasts that she breast-fed every one of her six children and later taught each of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work all the time . I 'm organized . I 've learned to budget every minute .
