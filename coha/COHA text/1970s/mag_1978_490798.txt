THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment ON a gloom y morning last week  --  it was around six o'clock , and the yellow-orange street lights were preserving upper Columbus Avenue in an eerie holding pattern ; the sky above the buildings was noncommittal ( rain was predicted ) ? an old man with white hair and , over a stubbly chin , a dead cigar stump stuck in a mouth that had few , if any , teeth was sitting serenely on a rust-colored Dellwood milk crate in front of a closed supermarket , gazing around . He was bundled up in sweaters , his cane leaned against the wall of the store , and at his feet were three shopping bags stuffed with God knows what . Among the cars parked overnight at the curb was a station wagon full of kettledrums . A Klock north , a man was carefully polishing his car in the odd light . Across the street , a man went racing down the sidewalk on a bicycle with a mop attached to the frame ; the mop flew out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things were very quiet . The old man on the milk crate suddenly began to sing , in a carefree tone , a song called " Together , Wherever We Go . " - Wherever we go , Whatever we do ... Presently , a big Dellwood truck pulled up ; the old man stopped singing and began chatting with the delivery-man , who was unloading crates of milk . Then something caught his eye : a tall , skinny man , with trousers that ended just below the knee , loping across Columbus Avenue half a block away . " Leon ! Hey , Leon ! " the old man called , waving and beckoning . The tall man indicated that he was far too busy to he interrupted at the moment but that he would return shortly , The old man 's attention turned hack to the Dellwood man . They exchanged amenities ; the pile of milk crates grew taller and taller , and was topped off with boxes of eggs . Abruptly , the man with the abbreviated trousers came springing down the sidewalk . He talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if by agreement -- perhaps long-standing  --  he picked up one of the man 's shopping hags and went bouncing away with it . The old man watched his departure for a while , then turned hack to the deliveryman . " Leon 's strange , " he said , " but he 's a nice guy . " ? ? Wien , Wien .. . ONE of the guests at a private party at the Cafe ' Fanny , on the ground floor of the Biltmore Hotel , the night before it opened for business was E. M. Frimbo . We turn you over to him : I have always been fond of living in railway hotels , which are scarce in this country hat rather more plentiful abroad . There is even one annexed to the station in Kuala Lumpur , the capital city of Malaysia . This is one that the British , in the days when Malaysia was part of the Federated Malay States , built with true Oriental opulence , topped by more minarets than you could count on the feet of a centipede . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kentucky Fried Chicken in Malaysia  --  hut I 'd rather not go into that . The Biltmore has since the day the cornerstone was laid , in the early teens of this century , been a railway hotel of some renown , standing over the right-of-way of the New York &; Harlem , which eventually became part of the New York Central , which eventually became part of the financial catastrophe known as the Penn Central . I have always had a proprietary interest in the Biltmore , having been for many years a shareholder in the New York &; Harlem  --  not a had investment , since shareholders were guaranteed a tenper-cent dividend for four hundred and one years . Ah , me ! The Biltmore was probably the most social railway hotel in the world when John McEntee Bowman , who was deeply involved in the annual National Horse Show , presided over it . I slept many a night there , and downed many a brandy Alexander , mostly in the rooftop supper club , where such young ladies as Jane Pickens , of the Pickens Sisters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty slim Pickens . " There was also the Bowman Room , for dinner dancing , and there was the honorable custom of tea-ing and trysting under the celebrated clock in the lobby . Hotels , like the rest of us , must swing with the times , and when Prohibition was imposed upon us  --  this was when I really began to dislike the con cept of minority rule the Biltmore had to start converting bars and such into shopfronts . James Farley came to the rescue of the Biltmore and of my investment when , as Postmaster General under Franklin Delano Roosevelt , he engineered Repeal . Some of the Biltmore 's shopfronts then disappeared in favor of a splendid enterprise on the corner of Madison and Forty-third called the Men 's Bar . It must have been the most soft-spoken lunching place in midtown Manhattan , and it was certainly one of the most nourishing . Naturally , adjustment was in order during the Second World War , and for the specified meatless days the chef produced what I considered his greatest handiwork  --  eggplant steak , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7 8 mirable vegetable gently broiled , and seasoned with a great panoply of Italian herbs . Then another swing of the times : the trains to Chicago , the trains to San Francisco and Los Angeles , even to Mexico City , that ran out of Grand Central Terminal , of which the Biltmore is an appendage , began to disappear , and the convenience of the Biltmore , a hotel beloved by all us incessant railway travellers , began to dwindle , too . Next came the ascent of women 's lib and the notion that any institution blatantly labelled " Men 's Bar " must be done away with . So a year or more ago there was a last supper for the assembled gentlemen , and the Bar 's forty-two-year career came to an end . I head up a committee called Concerned Diners , and we were preparing a delegation to the legislature in Albany , its purpose to propose legislation setting up a state commission to designate landmark restaurants that must not he closed , when I learned that the Men 's Bar was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George Lang , a Hungarian-born restaurateur of grand repute , was to involve himself . The net result is the Cafe Fanny , which looks like , and is delicately scented like , the sort of age-old brasserie I am fond of frequenting when I arrive on the Donau Kurier at the Westhahnhof in Vienna . The ? ? dark woodwork , the pink-shaded brass sconces , the black-and-white checkerboard marble floor , and the hardwood floor of the slightly raised gallery that runs around three sides of the Cafe Fanny all represent a bit of a homecoming to mc . And so does the menu , carefully captioned " Vorspeisen , " " Salate , " " Kaltes Buffet , " and " Schnitzel Spezialitiiten , " rend so waiter . " Sandwiches , " murmured a young lady whom up to that moment I had thought quite  --  well , appetizing . " What is the Austrian word for sandwicM " she inquired , and on that double error she was sent to the showers . It was the only untoward incident of the evening . There was music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violin and piano every weeknight at dinnertime . Breakfast at seven , and so on till midnight , every day of the week . There was , and there will be , pastry of devastating variety  --  all available , of course , Ind Schlag . And Austrian white wines  --  Kremser Rosenhiigler and the like  --  and an Austrian beer , Gisser , and all the Viennese coffees . The waiters , in their black vests and big white aprons , are another familiar touch . And why CafC . Fanny ? Fanny Elssler was a Viennese ballerina of the mid-nineteenth century , woo , the contemporary press said , took New York " by storm " in 1840 , some years ahead of my arrival . George Lang told me at the party that , since all Viennese coffeehouses are named after characters , he had originally thought of naming the room the Cafe Augustin , after " 0 , du lieher Augustin , " who is believed to have existed  --  to have been a singercomposer-poet who sang in the coffeehouses for free meals and was a friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a feminine name , and who had been doing a lot of research , came up with Fanny Elssler . She was a familiar character to Lang , because when he was a little boy in Hungary his parents had a porcelain figurine of her in their dining room . I feel that the Cafe Fanny , like another old favorite of mine , the Oyster Bar , is a big boost for the renaissance of the Grand Central Terminal Complex . The Team ONE recent evening , the West Tenth Street , East Tenth Street , East Eleventh Street , and Upper West Thirteenth Street Block Associations held a testimonial and reception at the Maison Franoise of New York University for Sergeant Robert Crowley , who had just retired from the New York City Police Department , and who for the last six and a half years had served as the Commander of the Sixth Precinct Neighborhood Police Team , a unit that has special responsibility for an area hounded by Broadway on the east , Eighth Street on the south , Sixth Avenue on the west , and Fourteenth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in June of 1971 , coincided with , and to a considerable extent caused , a sudden flourishing of block associations in the neighborhood , all of which proceeded to work in close coordination with the Team to reduce crime in the area . And , in fact , in the two years following the establishment of the Team the number of arrests almost doubled and the number of major crimes  --  among them murder , rapt , robbery , and burglary -- was cut in half . Thereafter , the amount of crime Increased slightly , but it remained far below the pre-1971 figures . The testimonial to Sergeant Crowley thus marked the conclusion of a long and successful collaboration . The Maison Francais. - is a two-story house at the west end of the Washington Mews , the carless street that runs from Fifth Avenue to - University Place just north of Washington Square , and we arrived there around half past five , as the testimonial was getting under way . We found ourself in a large , warmly lit , comfortable room with a crowd of eighty or ninety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in roughly equal parts of block-association members from the neighborhood , policemen  --  they ranged in rank from Police Commissioner Michael J. Codd down to several patrolmen from the Neighborhood Team  --  and friends of Sergeant Crowley , many of them from Massapequa , Long Island , where Sergeant Crowley lives . His wife , Agnes , and a son . Terrence , age seventeen , were also present . Wine and cheese were being served at a table in one corner . The policemen , the Village block activists , and the family and friends were mixing easily and talking freely , without any of the aimless wandering about , stiff silences , or shouted conversations that characterize so many semi-public gatherings in New York City . At the center of the room , spinning around almost continually to greet , and often to embrace , his admirers , was Sergeant Crowley , a tallish , handsome man in a pin-striped blue suit , with a fluid , easygoing manner , who had a melancholy cast to his features but also had a charming smile , which was now appearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . We were introduced to two policemen who worked under Sergeant Crowley on the Neighborhood Team  --  Police Officer Frank Monahan , a young man with a pale face and a mustache who was wearing a gray suit with belied trousers , and Police Officer Richard Castro , a stocky man who was wearing an open shirt and , over that , a black garment that was n't another shirt but was n't quite a jacket , either . We asked the two officers how they liked working on the Team . " We volunteered for it , " Officer Monahan said . " The Team made it easier to meet people in the neighborhood on a friendly basis . The Team members are encouraged to go into stores on their heats and get to know the people there . Without that , you only meet people in stress situations . Like in robberies . " " We get to know people on a first-name . basis , " Officer Castro said . " Like Annie Silverman , over there . I just call her Annie . " He beckoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she came over to join in our conversation . " At the beginning , I did n't trust cops at all , " Miss Silverman told us . " I was a sixties person . But when I became president of the West Tenth Street Block Association I got to know the men on the Team . Bob Crowley gave us so much extra time and extra effort  --  and , most of all , encouragement . ' You can do it , Annie , ' he would say . I discovered that the police are human beings . They are so beautiful . I mean , they are people , just like you and me . " Monahan and Castro seemed pleased to hear this but a little unsure how to respond to it . They remained silent . Miss Silverman was speaking with considerable vehemence , and she went on to disclose the fact that she was now a policeman herself  --  or , to he precise , an auxiliary policewoman . " Look at this , " she said , pulling a color photograph out of a wallet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the back of a horse , and wearing a bright smile . The award ceremony was conducted by Gerard George , president of the East Tenth Street Block Association . He began it by introducing Commissioner Codd , who is a man of physically huge proportions . The Commissioner addressed the group with a simple , dignified demeanor in which something seemed to remain of the almost sleepy taciturnity of a policeman on the heat ; he spoke of Sergeant Crowley as a " wonderful " man , and wished him well in the future . There was applause , followed by further testimonials  --  from Deputy Inspector Edward Walsh , who had recently served as commanding officer of the Sixth Precinct ; from Annie Silverman and other community leaders ; and from State Assemblyman William Passannante , who represents the district  --  and then Sergeant Crowley thanked all those who had thanked him , and also thanked his wife and his son , adding that Terrence had got a haircut for the occasion . " That must he love , " Crowley observed . After the ceremony , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell us something about his experiences as the leader of the Sixth Precinct Neighborhood Police Team . " I 'm in a semi-euphoric state , " be told us . " The main thing was that the people  --  the people you sec here tonight and the other people in the neighborhood  --  responded . I ca n't say that enough . We had a relationship based on warmth , honesty , and truth . " We asked how the Neighborhood Teams had got going . " The idea was to give police units in the ncighhorhoods the latitude to do what was needed for that particular neighborhood , and to establish contact with the community , " Sergeant Crowley said . " The Teams were widespread throughout the city in the early nineteen-seventies , but now the number has been greatly cut back . In the period before the Teams were started , the police stood off from the community  --  especially here in the Village . There was that gap . Up to that time , equal coverage was given to all areas in a precinct , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concentrated where the crime was heaviest . For instance , our neighborhood had twenty-six per cent of the crime in the precinct , so our Team was assigned twenty-six per cent of the patrolmen . Until then , the trend had been toward mobility  --  patrol cars . The police number , 911 , had an epidemic of calls  --  as many as eighteen thousand a day in 1971 . Some months now , there are even more . Foot patrols could n't respond to them all , and patrol cars had to be sent . But men in patrol cars could not get to know the neighborhoods easily , and the whole facelessness thing grew out of that . " When we got the Team established , the first thing we did was to stuff mailboxes . We wrote a letter describing the Team and sent it to every resident . Then I went to the management of the Fifth Avenue Hotel and got their permission to set up a desk in the lobby at night , so people could come in and ask questions . We advertised the desk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have the patrolmen introduce themselves to all the people in the stores on their blocks . For a policeman , getting to know the people in the neighborhood develops his territorial imperative . He develops great personal pride in protecting his people . And as soon as we had got to know the people , I realized that the people were going to be a tremendous source of intelligence for us . " Because we were in charge of an area that was small enough , we could analyze very specifically the types of crime that were going on . Let me give you an example . We noticed a large rise in thefts from autos  --  eight hundred and nineteen between June of 1971 ) and June of 1971 . Nnw , where do people park their cars ? On the side streets , right ' Where their homes are . But throughout New York City most patrols have always been on avenues  --  traditionally , the patrols move north and south . We took the patrols off the avenues and put them on the side streets , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to a hundred and three for 1974 . Burglaries from homes were also down , by about one-third . Crime in the rest of the city was skyrocketing , but we were going the other way . There was a lot of mugging , too , around this time . Together with the block associations , we developed the Block Watchers ' program , which is now in use in many parts of the city . A retired gentleman  --  Mr. Charles Morgan , of Ninth Street  --  gave me the idea . He has many interests , but he also just likes to sit on the stoop and keep an eye on things  --  he 's very bright and alert . We went and asked people to register to look out of the window . We put together an enormous amount of information . Then we published some of it in the block-association newsletters , and people got some idea of what to watch for and how to prevent crimes . I 'm a great believer in descriptions . For instance , I think that a mugger is very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pair of shoes . He may have two shirts and two pairs of pants , but the coat and the shoes will always be the same ones . Once , in 1973 , a young man mugged several women in the neighborhood but did it very gently . He approached with a knife , took their money , and then apologized and gave them a kiss . Through our network of information , we learned that he had taps on his shoes . One day , a fellow with a plastic gun was brought into the precinct . I thought , Something is strange here , but I do n't know what . Then I heard it  --  click , click . The taps . ' e brought in several victims , who identified him as the mugger ; he was arrested , prosecuted , and convicted . " We asked Sergeant Crowley what had happened to the Team in the last year or two . " It was being nibbled away . Some very hard decisions about manpower had to be made  --  I 'm not saying I would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the loser . I lost my flexibility , and I decided that it was time to move on to something else  --  what , I still do n't know . " Speech SINCE assuming office last January , Daniel Patrick Moynihan , the junior senator from New York , has tried to get hack to his home state about twice a month , usually for a one- or two-day visit . Not long ago , Senator Moynihan decided to spend four consecutive days in New York City , during which he planned to speak before a meeting of the American Apparel Manufacturers Association , to hold a press conference , to attend a meeting of the Democratic State Committee , to go to a reception held by the Municipal Art Society , to address a banquet given by the United Jewish Appeal , to appear on the WCBS-TV program " Newsmakers , " and to participate in a number of other functions . We caught up with the Senator at the end of his first day in town  --  a Thursday  --  and found him looking confident , exuberant , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New York Academy of Sciences , which was being held at the Hayden Planetarium , starting with a dinner in the Guggenheim Space Theatre , on the planetarium 's ground floor . The Space Theatre is the large , drum-shaped room whose ceiling is equipped with a working model of the solar system  --  the sun and the planets represented by revolving and rotating spheres  --  and whose walls are covered with screens on which slides of nebulae , galaxies , and other astronomical phenomena can be projected . Although the solar system had been turned off for the evening , the slides presented a continuously changing celestial display While Senator Moynihan , who was wearing a fashionably wide black tie , chatted with Professor I. I. Rabi , the physicist , and Dr. Fritz Lipmann , the biochemist ( both of them are Nobel laureates ) , among others , at the main table , a meal was served that included veal Marsala , rice pilaf , and buttered asparagus . Beneath the nonfunctioning solar system , a wood quintet played Vivaldi , Rameau , Haydn , and Beethoven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man in a dinner jacket called out , " Let 's hear some Scott Joplin ! " The quintet launched into Joplin 's " Cascades . " After dinner , we strolled with Senator Moynihan toward a stairway leading to the Sky Theatre , on the floor above . " I got to New York this ? ? morning and I intended to stay through Sunday , " he told us . " But this afternoon I got a call from my Washington office . There 's going to be a meeting of the Senate Finance Committee tomorrow , so I 'll fly back down in the morning , then fly back to New York in time for my Saturday appointments . This means I 'll have to cancel a couple of events tomorrow , unfortunately . Sunday night , I leave for Los Angeles , where I 'm going to speak before the A.F.L.-C.I.O. convention . " We accompanied Senator Moynihan into the Sky Theatre , which is the planetarium 's main hall  --  the one with the great white dome on which the universe , as it is seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four hundred members of the Academy took seats for the annual meeting . Dr. Herbert J. Kayden , a physician , who was the Academy 's outgoing president , presented awards to eleven scientists for outstanding accomplishments in their fields . Dr. Charlotte Friend , a microbiologist , was installed as the first woman president in the Academy 's history . Then Senator Moynihan stood in front of the hall 's projection apparatus  --  the huge instrument that looks like a cross between a deep-sea diver 's suit and a lunar-landing moduIe  --  and gave the keynote address . It dealt with the relationship between science and society , and it contained allusions to Thomas Jefferson , John Adams , Benjamin Franklin , Alexander Hamilton , Mark Twain , Charles Darwin , Friedrich Nietzsche , Karl Marx , George Orwell , Alben Barkley , and Daniel Boorstin . " In a demystified world , science remains the only authority , and the authority of science , which liberalism did so much to develop , does not now lean unambiguously in its favor , " Senator Moynihan said . " At present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought or to risk seeing that vacuum filled with a technocratic perspective on society that seeks to solve problems by treating individuals as mere subjects of science  --  by progressing , as it were , beyond freedom and dignity ! . Thus it is with great concern that liberal democracy looks toward the future . " Senator Moynihan 's speech was followed by an address by Dr. Alexander Rich , who is Sedgwick Professor of Biophysics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology . After the meeting , we rejoined the Senator as he moved toward a reception area , where people had begun to drink punch . " Do you know something ? " he said . " I have n't been in this building since I was a kid . I used to shine shoes on the corner of Eighty-first and Columbus , less than a block from where we are now . I remember that on December 7 , 1941 , a man walked up to get a shoeshine . While I was polishing his shoes , he told me that the Japanese had attacked Pearl Harbor . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could interview him for an article she was writing . " I 'd just like to get you alone for an hour , " she said . " I 'd just like to get myself alone for an hour , " said Senator Moynihan , gazing toward the planetat rn 's artificial heavens .
