Struggling to offset the damaging impact of the Watergate grand jury indictments , which charged that a criminal cover-up conspiracy had permeated the White House , President Nixon last week took the rare step of holding his second press conference within eight days . Though he was grim and nervous , he came across forcefully in defending his own role in that ill-fated scheme . But before the week was over , there were more indictments of his men , and a determined House Judiciary Committee pushed tenaciously ahead in its impeachment inquiry . <P> Much of Nixon 's news conference focused on a crucial meeting in his office on March 21 , 1973 , and on precisely what he had said then about the possibility of continuing illegal hush money payments to silence the original Watergate burglars ( see box , next page ) . He also used the press conference to explain his current attitude toward the impeachment inquiry . He yielded ground to the Judiciary Committee-up to a point and only under intense pressure . <P> The President agreed to give the committee all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leon Jaworski . As tallied by Nixon , that included 19 White House tape recordings and some 700 documents . Nixon would , moreover , be willing to answer written questions from the committee . If there were still issues to be resolved after that , he promised , he would answer questions under oath in a White House meeting with Chairman Peter Rodino of New Jersey and the committee 's ranking Republican , Edward Hutchinson of Michigan . Nixon termed this " a very forthcoming offer . " <P> Legal Sparring . But then he pulled some taut strings- on it . The President said that he would not allow anyone " to cart everything that is in the White House down to a committee and to have them paw through it on a fishing expedition . " Next day his lawyer , James St. Clair , sent a letter to the committee rejecting its request for evidence beyond what Jaworski had acquired . St. Clair complained that the committee seemed to be asking for " hundreds of thousands of documents and thousands of hours of recorded conversations covering the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committee " determine what is an impeachable offense " before demanding the evidence . Implicit was the likelihood that St. Clair would reject requests that did not fit his own limited interpretation of impeachable acts . <P> The St. Clair argument is that a President can be impeached only for crimes of " a very serious nature committed in one 's governmental capacity . " He refuses to detail what acts that definition would either embrace or exclude . Apparently , however , it would exclude the President 's income tax problems , which are nongovernmental , and any campaign-funding violations , because running for office is not an official duty . Some top Washington lawyers consider St. Clair 's contention to be merely legalistic sparring with the Rodino committee , which will in no way be limited by any White House definition .
