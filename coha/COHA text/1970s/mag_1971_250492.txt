WHEN West Pakistani soldiers arrested Sheik Mujibur ( " Mujib " ) Rahman last week , they gave him a chance to add to an unenviable record . Mujib has already spent more time in prison than any other major Pakistani politician : nine years and eight months . <P> What makes the Sheik so unpopular with West Pakistanis is the fact that for more than 23 years he has been the leading advocate of purbodesh ( regional autonomy ) for East Pakistan . In last December 's elections , purbodesh was Mujib 's chief issue . After visiting the cyclone-devastated Ganges Delta region just before the general elections , he declared : " If the polls bring us frustration , we will owe it to the million who have died in the cyclone to make the supreme sacrifice of another million lives , if need be , so that we can live as free people . " - <P> Gray-haired , stocky and tall for a Bengali ( 6 ft. ) , the bespectacled Mujib always wears a loose white shirt with a black , sleeveless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scold Bengalis like so many children . He was born in the East Bengal village of Tongipara 51 years ago to a middle-class landowner ( his landlord status accounts for the title of sheik ) . Mujib studied liberal arts at Calcutta 's Islamia College and law at Dacca University . He lives with his wife Fazil-itunessa , three sons and two daughters in a modest two-story house in Dacca 's well-to-do Dhanmandi section . Except for a brief stint as an insurance salesman , he has devoted most of his time to politics . First he opposed British rule in India . After the subcontinent 's partition in 1947 , he denounced West Pakistan 's dominance of East Pakistan with every bit as much vehemence . " Brothers , " he would say to his Bengali followers , " do you know that the streets of Karachi are lined with gold ? Do you want to take back that gold ? Then raise your hands and join me . " He was first jailed in 1948 , when he demonstrated against Pakistan Founder Mohammed Ali Jinnah for proclaiming Urdu the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remained , in many respects , a political moderate . He is a social democrat who favors nationalizing major industries , banks and insurance companies . In foreign policy too he follows a middle course . Where West Pakistan 's Zulfikar Ali Bhutto favors closer ties with China and the Soviet Union and is stridently anti-Indian , Mujib would like to trade with India and is regarded as moderately pro-Western.
