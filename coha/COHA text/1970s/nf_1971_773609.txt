txt 8o ENGLISH LITERATURE tragic dramas provided an inexhaustible reservoir of themes on which the poets and the dramatists of the Renaissance could draw . The experiments in the introduction of classical metres and literary modes were not persisted in after it had become clear that the genius of the English language was unsuited to them . But nevertheless there went on a gradual process of adaptation of native and classical elements . For example , Spenser , in the Shepherd 's Calendar , borrowing from Virgil the idea of the pastoral eclogue , or dialogue in verse , used it in an entirely different spirit . While Virgil 's peasants spoke the language of cultivated Rome , those of Spenser used rustic forms of speech . In fact , the poet was a more faithful disciple of Chaucer than of Virgil ; the February fable of the oak and the briar was told in the Chaucerian manner , with a touch of humour which was entirely absent from the Virgilian model . The unquestioning acceptance of the critical rules of the ancients by Sir Philip Sidney in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deliberate choice of classical principles for poetry and drama . Yet when we consider that Sidney was writing about 158o , before the astonishing literary outburst in the closing decades of the century , his leanings are easily understood . The great triumphs of Shakespeare and his contemporaries which were to follow were an expression of native genius , and had Sidney written a generation later , he would have had these wonderful examples of the romantic spirit in literature to match against the classics . In general the great Elizabethans , while respectful of the classical models , challenged their authority with something of the assured and independent spirit of Drake in face of the overwhelming power of the Spanish empire . They were confident of their own world and its values . The Development of a Scientific Outlook The second prominent aspect of Humanism was the discovery of the external universe , the study of its significance for humanity , and the representation of it through literary and visual media . The first scientific academy for stellar observation was established at Naples late in the fifteenth century , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were set on foot two great quests of the very first importance for the future of the human race . The Copernican system replaced astrology by astronomy , while the opening-up of access to the Seven Seas radically altered the balance of political power in Europe . // The scientific movement hardly touched England during the sixteenth century ; her energies , being thrown into geographical discovery , were directed rather on colonization , and prepared her for her future role as a world power . For one allusion to the advances in natural science which can be found in the pages of Elizabethan and Jacobean literature , there are scores which reflect the exciting news of the wide world brought by the seamen . Sir Walter Raleigh stands as a great example of the explorer-poet . Hakluyt spent his life " making diligent inquiry of such things as might yield any light unto our western discovery in America " and his great work entitled The Principal Navigations , Voyages , Trafques and Discoveries of the English Nation has been called a national " prose epic . " It supplied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Fletcher for Sea Island , and it is quite natural that Bacon should have placed his imaginary commonwealth , the New Atlantis , in the distant West . While the imagination of some thinkers and reformers was stirred by the contemplation of new life developing in the new lands , others were moved towards the scientific study of the past . So far there had been no systematic approach to history . Of chronicles there were many , and we know what excellent use our writers made of them . Sir Thomas North 's translation of Plutarch 's Lives ( 1579 ) was abundantly used by Shakespeare . An earlier translation by Lord Berners of the Chronicles of Froissart ( 1523 ) satisfied a demand for historical adventure , while Foxe 's Book of Martyrs ( 1563 ) served for religious biography . But perhaps the first approach to serious historical analysis was made by Bacon in his History of the Reign of Henry VII ( 1622 ) . The Study of Human . Personality We have been considering the humanist looking outward at the universe and backward into history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he directed his gaze also inward , and became deeply interested in the problems of human personality . In the pages of earlier literature ( allowing for the creations of Chaucer as rare exceptions ) we find types rather than individuals . In medieval morality plays , the characters are mostly personifications : Fellowship , Kindred , Knowledge , and the like . The humanist , as a convinced believer in the dignity of man , was interested in the expression of personality ; that is to say , of that group of qualities which distinguishes one human being from another and gives to each the uniqueness which may be called his individual soul . This explains why it was that humanism set // such store by education . Sir John Colet , a pioneer of the New Learning in England , founded St. Paul 's School . He was one of a long line of educationists who advocated the discipline of the humanities as the basis of an intellectual and moral training , and meanwhile did not neglect the cultivation of the body . Ascham 's Scholemaster has , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , called Toxophilus . Between them they suggest the blend of studies and games which is characteristic of our system of education . The sixteenth century was a testing time when the possibilities of the human personality were being explored in all sorts of ways : physical , intellectual , and moral . Just as there were trials of physical endurance made by the intrepid navigators who went out into the unknown with gay and confident hearts , so there were probations of the mind and spirit . It is not surprising that the literary essay should have emerged at such a time , since it is , as its name implies , also a species of trial or endeavour , in which individual experience , private meditation , wit and fancy are together matched in a kind of contest against a subject chosen at random . The essay became thus in essence a touchstone of the quality of the writer 's mind , as well as being an assay or testing of the possibilities of the theme . The essays of Bacon and of Montaigne were self-revealing . But there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest in personality , deriving its value from close observation of the external behaviour of men and women . The publication of the Characters of Sir Thomas Overbury , beginning in 1614 , set a fashion in a new kind of literary composition , in which a portrait of a human " type " was attempted in a few brief strokes . " Characters " were often issued singly in pamphlet form , printed in large type for window display . Examples of Overbury 's Characters are the Good Wife , the Worthy Commander , the Affectate Traveller , the Milk Maid , and the Critic . There were numerous imitators , of whom the most popular was John Earle , the author of Microcosmographie ( 1628 ) . His characters , including such well-known portraits as those of the She Hypocrite , the College Butler , the Church Papist , give us a lively idea of the manners of the time . Altogether some two hundred of such collections were published during the seventeenth century . Though the character-writers occasionally illuminated human nature with flashes of insight , they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ akin to the " humours " on which Ben Jonson 's comedies were based . Taking some idiosyncrasy , folly , // affectation or overmastering passion as a starting point , he worked this up into a dramatic portrait , filling out the detail with every circumstance which might throw the " humour " into relief . This static conception of character-drawing allows no place for development or modification under the stress of events , which is so notable a feature of Shakespeare 's dynamic method . It may be admitted that for Ben Jonson 's dramatic purpose , which was derived from the practice of the ancients , the type was preferable to the individual . He was by disposition a satirist and accordingly found it convenient to isolate certain traits , rather than to present the whole man with his virtues as well as his vices . These were by no means the only literary evidences of the absorption of the humanist in the study of human personality . Christopher Marlowe probes down into the deep places of passion . His heroes are monstrosities , creatures of illimitable lusts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tamberlaine conquers , hates , and loves with ungovernable intensity . Barabas , the Jew of Malta , is possessed by an uncontrolled thirst for wealth , to be satisfied without mitigation of conscience or any other human attribute . Dr. Faustus too is portrayed in undiluted colours , consumed as he was by an insatiable appetite for knowledge , experience , power , and the gratification of the senses . He gathered up in himself the vital energy of a whole epoch . Shakespeare revealed himself as a more consummate artist than either Marlowe or Jonson , because his perceptions were more subtle . They were more scholarly than he , but their learning was carried as a burden and weighed them down . Shakespeare 's intellect and spirit were free and untramelled . His genius , illuminated by the purer flame of the Renaissance , enabled him to see life whole , and to present it to us in his plays " in the round . " He too could delineate passion , but it was the passion that belongs to creatures of flesh and blood , neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abstractions of Jonson 's cold logic . It was this same awakening of personality ; this same new passion for life , which gave us the exquisite lyrical poetry of the Elizabethan Age . The will to live and to savour all that life could offer was a prominent feature of the Renaissance mind ; but this is not the full expression of it . For we discern also in the poets of the time an ever-present awareness of the imminence of death and decay , which gives a poignancy to all their zest and exuberance . // The Cultivation of the Sense of Beauty The fourth aspect of the humanistic movement which we shall discuss is the enhanced sensitiveness to formal beauty , and the cultivation of the aesthetic sense . Formal art in the Middle Ages was the handmaid of religion . It was justified by something which lay outside itself . Renaissance art rested secure in its own laws , and the feeling for beauty spread over the whole of life . It showed itself in a new ideal of social conduct , that of the courtier . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and man of letters , in his treatise entitled Il Cortigiano ( " The Courtier " ) , written in 1514 , and afterwards translated into English . Here we have the pattern of gentlemanly deportment and feeling upon which the conduct of such men as Sir Philip Sidney and Sir Walter Raleigh was modelled . The ideal embraced not only a dignified courtliness of bearing , but also standards of physical perfection , of moral compunction , and of personal honour . It came to literary expression in numerous forms . It is significant that George Puttenham , the author of The Arte of English Poesie ( 1589 ) , with whom systematic theorizing on problems of style begins in English literature , passes quite naturally from the consideration of poetry and rhetoric to the analysis of manners . " Style , " he wrote , " is the image of man , " anticipating by many years the saying of Buffon : Le style c'est 1'homme . The desire to add beauty and colour to life brought about the development of carnivals or pageants , an important feature in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the arts : architecture , sculpture , painting , music , dancing , mime , drama , and costume , to produce effects of fantasy , allegory , or scenic magnificence . It is to this taste that we must ascribe the popularity of the Masque . These were court spectacles intended to satisfy the love of glitter and novelty . They had , at first , no dramatic element , and were used for the most part as elaborate compliments on occasions of high ceremony . The masquers entered , posed , offered their homage and withdrew , or joined with the company in a dance . Later the dramatic element was added , as in George Peele 's Arraignment of Paris , wherein Paris amends his ancient fault in awarding the apple to Venus by giving it to " Eliza . " An example of the earlier kind of masque may be studied in Shakespeare 's Henry VIII , Act I , Scene 4 . Of the later kind Ben Jonson was the most prolific writer . Between 1604 and 1630 he wrote thirty masques , many in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not before it had enriched our literature with the // magnificent poetry of Milton 's Comus , written in compliment to the Earl of Bridgewater for presentation at Ludlow Castle in 1634 . After the Restoration , the demand for lavish spectacle , associated with music and dancing , was met by opera and pantomime . We shall discuss later how the cult of elegance in prose-writing produced the exaggerations of Euphuism . But whatever views are held as to the merit of Lyly and his imitators , there can be no doubt that English prose gained in pithiness and harmony as a result of their efforts to introduce order and balance into it . Moral and Religious Aspects Our analysis of Humanism brings us now to a consideration of the moral and religious character of the age and of its expression in literature . In the new movement , the emphasis was not on the practical sanctions of morality and religion as embodied in the teachings of the Church and its sacraments , but on the ultimate sources of their authority , and on the problem of reconciling the principle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , based on concepts of absolute good and absolute evil . The mood of the time was tinged with paganism , or at any rate with rationalism . Men came to be regarded as responsible for their own actions : The fault , dear Brutus , is not in our stars , But in ourselves , that we are underlings . Authority was to be found within ; guidance was from the light in the heart of Everyman . Lyly 's romance of Euphues was written not as a mere exercise in a new kind of prose , but with the serious purpose of inculcating righteousness of living , based on self-control . Sidney 's Arcadia also used fiction to expound an ideal of moral excellence . Spenser 's plan for the Faerie Queene borrowed from all the great ethical systems . Temperance or Self-Control was typically a Greek virtue ; Holiness was Christian ; Courtesy belonged to medieval Chivalry . Spenser 's many-sidedness accorded with the intrepid , inquiring , adventurous genius of the Elizabethan age . We do not look for direct moral teaching in Shakespeare , because his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ didactic . But nevertheless there is , underlying his work , the same profoundly moral attitude to the world . He showed the same eclecticism as Spenser . His characters derive their impulses not wholly or even principally from Christian teaching , but from varied sources , among // which the example of the great men of pagan antiquity is important . Shakespeare 's was not a conscious paganism , and there is much to suggest that he was a completely orthodox adherent of the newly established Church . But this does not prevent his interpreting life in terms other than those of the conventional morality of goodness rewarded by happiness , and sin visited by retribution . His tragedies are crowded with characters who notwithstanding their essential goodness are destroyed by a moral defect which is brought into fatal prominence by a special set of circumstances . The first important attempt to interpret in humanistic terms the great controversial questions which the Reformation left as a legacy to future ages was made by Richard Hooker in his Laws of Ecclesiastical Polity ( 1594 ) . The " : judicious Hooker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but his work is characterized by the broad tolerance of Humanism , and by his insistence that the individual conscience is the supreme guide of conduct . The second quarter of the seventeenth century produced a group of outstanding thinkers whose reflections on religion and morality are expressed in prose of sustained dignity and beauty . Jeremy Taylor in his Liberty of Prophesying ( 1647 ) and Holy Living and Holy Dying ( 1650 ) revealed the same breadth of outlook as Hooker . He asserted the humanist claim for intellectual freedom , untrammelled by the traditional concepts of medieval scholasticism . Sir Thomas Browne 's Religio Medici has been called " a diary of the soul . " It has a quality of humour which was also in strong evidence in Robert Burton 's Anatomy of Melancholy . A third writer also possessing humour in great measure , though lacking the depth of Browne and Burton , is Thomas Fuller , the author of numerous prose works of which the most noteworthy is The Worthies of England . CHAPTER VII THE ELIZABETHAN TRADITION IN POETRY OUR knowledge of the poetry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main to the enterprise of Tottel , a London publisher , who collected a number of poems which had not previously been printed , and issued them first in 1S57 as Tottel 's Miscellany of Songs and Sonnettes , written by the ryght honorable Lorde Henry Howard Late Earle of Surrey . He gathered the poems from various private " commonplace books " of his friends , in which the owners had copied out and preserved verses circulated in manuscript . The original edition of the Miscellany contained 271 poems , of which forty were attributed to Howard , ninety-six to Sir Thomas Wyatt , forty to Nicholas Grimald , and ninety-five to other unspecified authors . Nearly all the poems were posthumous . In later editions the contents were varied , possibly as further commonplace books were drawn upon and as the authorship of anonymous poems became known . The poems are printed without any indication of chronological order . The Courtly School of Poetry It appears that there was , moving in and around the royal Court , a group of about a score of brilliant young amateurs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company of courtly makers . " They were scions of noble families , among whom writing was a graceful accomplishment rather than a serious form of art . They brought to their writing the kind of training and the same general attitude to life and society which Roger Ascham , appointed private tutor to Queen Elizabeth in 1558 , describes in The Scholemaster . They were all influenced by the spirit of Humanism , and on their private and diplomatic travels , many of them had acquired a taste for Italian and French literary modes . Sir Thomas Wyatt ; The special reference to the Earl of Surrey on the title page of Tottel 's Miscellany was probably intended as a compliment to one who ranked so high in society ( his sister had been Queen Catherine Howard ) . But the first of this group of poets in point of date and of // // importance is Sir Thomas Wyatt ( 1503 ? 42 ) . His genius was essentially lyrical , and his great achievement is to have introduced into our literature the " singing note . " Generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but there is also an undercurrent of meditation upon the deeper meaning of life and death . He used numerous metrical forms , among which the sonnet is by far the most important . Except that he ended the sestet with a couplet , his sonnets were written mainly on the Petrarchan model . Several were translations or adaptations , but there was an independent note as well , for the sonnets were not all literary exercises on an abstract theme . The emotions described seem to express real and poignant experience , and the images employed are original . Other innovations which we owe to Wyatt are the employment of the Italian terza rima for satire and for renderings of the Penitential Psalms . Henry Howard , Earl of Surrey The Earl of Surrey ( 1515 ? 47 ) is said to have gleaned where Wyatt reaped . But while much of his work was on similar lines , he made contributions of his own to our literature . First of these in importance was his employment of blank verse . Perhaps it should be called an invention , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it may well be supposed that Surrey , in translating the second and fourth books of Virgil 's Aeneid , should have attempted to come nearer to the spirit of the classics by refraining from the use of rhyme , a literary device unknown to the ancient poets , and now condemned by scholars of the New Learning as " rude , beggarly ryming , first brought into Italie by the Gothes and Hunnes when all good verses and all good learning too were destroyed by them . " The same thing had occurred to some Italian poet-dramatists of the time , and it is really of little importance to speculate whether Surrey adopted a timid suggestion of unrhymed decasyllabic verse from the Italians , or was following an inspiration of his own . What is important is that our literature at this critical moment should have been endowed with a prosodic measure which proved to be so admirably suited to the genius of the language , and one in which our noblest poetry has found expression . Surrey 's use of blank verse was wooden and it was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and exploit its rich potentialities . ( See p. 49 . ) One further innovation of Surrey 's is of interest . It was he who broke up the sonnet into three quatrains and a couplet , and set the example which Shakespeare followed . // Sir Thomas Sackville The work of Wyatt and Surrey was followed up at the distance of a few years by that of Sir Thomas Sackville ( 1536-1608 ) , later Earl of Dorset . In his Induction to the Mirror for Magistrates , which was written in Chaucerian stanzas , he showed a masterly power of poetic utterance . The plan of the poem is based on Dante 's Inferno , and is an account of the poet 's descent into the underworld guided by Sorrow , where he encounters the gruesome shapes of Misery , Revenge , Care , War and others . The easy flow of the verse wedded to the imaginative sweep of the conception produced a poem far in advance of anything the century had yet seen Lastly stood War , in glittering arms yclad , With visage grim , stern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a naked sword he had , That to the hilts was all with blood imbrued ; And in his left ( that Kings and Kingdoms rul 'd ) Famine and fire he held and therewithal He razed towns , and threw down towers and all . Unfortunately Sackville gave himself up to public affairs , and the loss to our literature it is impossible to compute . The Miscellanies The popularity of the " new poetry " may be inferred from the number of Miscellanies which followed Tottel 's . Their compilers vied with each other in finding attractive titles : The Paradise of Dainty Devices , The Gorgeous Gallery of Gallant Inventions , are examples . While under the early Tudors poetry was thus a fashionable accomplishment of the nobility and gentry , under Elizabeth it became , along with drama , the principal cultural expression of a wider social circle . England was likened to " a nest of singing birds . " By the end of the third quarter of the sixteenth century the efforts of the poethumanists to impose a discipline of form on the refractory language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-nigh accomplished . All that had been learned from the Romance literatures had been thoroughly assimilated , and the materials were available out of which marvels of literary art were shortly to be created . Edmund Spenser The first full expression of Renaissance poetry in England was attained by Edmund Spenser ( 1552-99 ) . His first important poem , The // Shepherd 's Calendar , was dedicated to Sir Philip Sidney in 1579 . It was a work which pointed both backwards and forwards . Spenser was steeped in the classics and was a lover of Chaucer from whose language he borrowed in order to give to his own the romantic appeal of the archaic . But he was at the same time using poetry in a new way . The pastoral eclogue was new to our literature , as were the touches of rustic realism which are scattered throughout the poem . Spenser himself illustrated a new development in respect of his relation to his poetry , for he was possibly our first professional man of letters , a seeker of patronage , and ( though he had political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Faerie Queene ( 1590 ) is prefaced by a letter addressed to Sir Walter Raleigh in which the poet 's purpose is stated and the plan of the work outlined . The purpose is moral instruction , through examples of virtuous conduct conveyed in the form of romantic allegory . Twelve " books " were planned , twelve being the traditional number of sections ( often called fyttes or cantos ) in works on an epic scale since Homer 's Iliad . Each of the twelve was to deal with some one aspect of virtuous conduct as practised by the individual , such as Holiness , Justice , and Courtesy . Another twelve books were contemplated , to deal with these virtues from the political angle . Each virtue was to be embodied in a separate hero . The figure of the Faerie Queene is not introduced at all , but Prince Arthur appears in each of the six finished books . The allegory is complex , and Spenser 's own explanations of it do not help us much . But though he himself set such store by the ethical purport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for its intrinsic beauty , its imaginative force , and its magical music . Charles Lamb 's reference to Spenser as " the poet 's poet " is supported by a long line of writers who , from Milton onwards , have returned to him as to a perennial spring of word melody , sensuous image , and imaginative suggestion . Two other poems by Spenser must be mentioned , as worthy to stand beside anything in the language for their flawless perfection . They are the marriage songs : Epithalamion ( 1594 ) and Prothalamion ( 1596 ) . Spenser uses for these an irregular rhymed metre of exquisite melody There in a meadow , by the Rivers side , A Flocke of Nymphes I chaunccd to espy , All lovely Daughters of the Flood thereby , // With goodly greenish locks , all loose untyde , As each had been a Bryde ; And each one had a little wicker basket , Made of fine twigs entrayled curiously , In which they gathered flowers to fill their flasket ; And with fore forgers , cropt full feateously The tender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Meadow grew , They gathered some , the Violet pallid blew , The little Dazie , that at evening closes , The virgin Lillie , and the Primrose trew , With store of vermeil Roses , To decke their Bridegromes posies , Against the Brydale day , which was not long : Sweete Thetnn:es runne softly , till I end my Song . Prothalatnion The same love-episode celebrated in the Epithalamion was the basic theme of Spenser 's sonnet sequence Amoretti ( 1595 ) . This was one of many such sequences which appeared during the last decade of the sixteenth century . Elizabethan Songs and Sonnets This decade was one of the most distinguished in the history of English poetry . It was a time when the sonnet blossomed in richer profusion than in any other age . But the sonneteers were not more remarkable than the song-writers , many of whom were anonymous . They had an extraordinary gift for writing light , tripping verses , eminently capable of being set to music , or on the other hand for fitting suitable words to airs . Why the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lyric , spoken or sung , it is not easy to explain . But there may be some significance in the sudden lifting of dread when the Spanish Armada was destroyed in 1588 . It was just then too that there occurred the rise of a great school of English Chamber Music , associated with the names of Tallis , Byrd , Dowland , Morley , and Orlando Gibbons . " It was necessary , " says Sir Edmund Gosse , " to find words for these airs , and the poems so employed were obliged to be lucid , liquid , brief and of a temper suited to the gaiety and sadness of the instrument . The demand created the supply , and from having been heavy and dissonant to a painful degree , English lyrics suddenly took a perfect art and sweetness. " 1 A contemporary poet and musician , Thomas . // Campion , wrote : " I have chiefly aimed to couple my words and notes lovingly together , which will be much for him to do that hath not powers over both . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this remarkable decade was love . In long sequences they analysed the passion in the abstract , or again described it in terms of their real feelings . Sidney set the fashion with Astrophel and Stella , which was published in 1591 , though written for private circulation some time earlier , and his example was followed by Constable ( Diana 1592 ) , Daniel ( Delia 1592 ) , Lodge ( Phyllis 1593 ) , Drayton ( Idea 1594 ) , Spenser ( Amoretti 1595 ) . Altogether about a thousand sonnets have survived from this short period . The fashion soon went out , but the writing of miscellaneous lyric verse in the courtly tradition continued without interruption until the great outburst of Cavalier poetry in the time of the early Stuarts . The most important collection of these lyrics were The Passionate Pilgrim ( 1599 ) , England 's Helicon ( 1600 ) and Poetical Rhapsody ( 1602 ) . It must be remembered that there was at this time no law of copyright , and compilers of anthologies used material from any source , whether in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore not surprising that the authorship should often be unknown or be wrongly stated . Nevertheless , our debt to the anthologists is incalculable , for without their enterprise , we might have lost many of our richest gems of poetry . Their authors were , as a rule , indifferent about publication , and each wrote only for a private circle . Puttenham refers to those who " have written excellently well , as it would appear if their doings could be found out and made public with the rest . " The three collections referred to are important because of their comprehensiveness and the excellent judgment of their compilers . Among the poets represented are Spenser , Sidney , Raleigh , Drayton , Lodge , Greene , Peele , Watson , Shakespeare , and Barnfield . While much of this " new poetry " is full of charm and melody , it is questionable whether it can be considered to have reached , except occasionally , the highest levels of lyrical emotion . The writers had certainly acquired a trick of throwing off poetical " devices " with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been little more than a trick . Writing was an exercise in a prevailing mode , and the results have the stamp of the artificial rather than of the spontaneous . There was no lack of heartiness and vivacity , and fancy was quick and sparkling . // Shakespeare 's Poems The non-dramatic poetry of Shakespeare ( 1564-1616 ) was comparatively youthful work , contemporaneous with his earliest plays . In 1593 Venus and Adonis was published and in the following year The Rape of Lucrece . Both were twice-told tales , as old as Ovid , and known in translations and adaptations . They were narrative poems , encumbered with rhetorical ornament in the Renaissance tradition . Yet Shakespeare was not entirely imitative . Born and bred in Warwickshire , he knew , for example , the points of a horse Round-hoof 'd , short jointed , fetlocks shag and long , Broad breast , full eye , small head , and nostril wide , High crest , short ears , straight legs and passing strong , Thin mane , thick tail , broad buttock , tender hide : Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Save a proud rider on so proud a back . and he does not hesitate to introduce such realistic detail into a story so utterly remote from life . The stanza of Venus and Adonis is made up of six decasyllabic lines , rhyming a b a b c c . That of the Rape of Lucrece , in rime royal , has more strength , and the euphuistic quality of the earlier poem here gives place to a more robust rhetoric . But neither poem is to be considered anything more than an exercise in a conventional manner , with no claim to originality . Most of the Sonnets , though not printed until 1609 , and then probably without leave , are known to have been in circulation in manuscript at least ten years earlier . Francis Meres in his Palladis Tamia ( 1598 ) refers to Shakespeare 's " sugred sonnets among his private friends . " It is because the plays throw comparatively little light on Shakespeare 's personality that so much speculation has been rife regarding the autobiographical element of the Sonnets . Though their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probable that the first 126 were addressed to a man and the remaining 28 to a woman ( the " dark lady " ) . There is certainly more of the poet 's passionate experience here than in the typical sonnet-sequence of the time ; yet it is possible to study and appreciate the Sonnets without having to adopt any of the theories which have been advanced to explain them . In any case , all attempts to interpret them as a chronological record of the development of the poet 's feelings have to be discounted , since it may be assumed that the piratical ' publisher had no special knowledge to assist him in arranging the sonnets in the order in which they are printed . // If there is a basic theme in the Sonnets it is the lament that love and beauty should be perishable things . But the sadness of mortality is tempered by the hope which is married to immortal verse Since brass , nor stone , nor earth , nor boundless sea , But sad mortality o'ersways their power , How with this rage shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a flower ? 0 , how shall summer 's honey breath hold out Against the wrackful siege of battering days , When rocks impregnable are not so stout , Nor gates of steel so strong , but Time decays ? O fearful meditation ! where , alack , Shall Time 's best jewel from Time 's chest lie hid ? Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back ? Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid ? 0 , none , unless this miracle have might , That in black ink my love may still shine bright . Sonnet No. 65 This note is often struck in the sonnets of the age , and gives some support to the view that there may be more of literary convention in them than of authentic feeling . The last two of the sequence ( Nos. 153 and 154 ) are obviously elaborations of " conceits " in the prevailing fashion , and are devoid of feeling . But these can be matched with others in which the utterance bears all the marks of passionate intensity . Among these may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's day ? " ( 18 ) ; " When in disgrace with Fortune and men 's eyes " ( 29 ) ; " When to the sessions of sweet silent thought " ( 30 ) ; " Full many a glorious morning have I seen " ( 33 ) ; " Since brass , nor stone nor earth nor boundless sea " ( 65 ) ; " Let me not to the marriage of true minds " ( 116 ) ; " The expense of spirit in a waste of shame " ( 129 ) ; " Two loves I have of comfort and despair " ( 144 ) . It is such sonnets as these that make the problem of Shakespeare 's personality such an intriguing one . Samuel Daniel and Michael Drayton A pair of writers whose work ( apart from that of Shakespeare ) spans the years between Spenser and Milton are Samuel Daniel ( 1562 ? 1619 ) and Michael Drayton ( 1563-1631 ) . They attempted to carry on the epic tradition , with England and her story as the basic theme . Daniel 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deals with the Wars of the Roses ; Drayton 's Polyolbion , " my strange // Herculean task " as he called it , is a " choreographical description " of the scenery and rarities of " this renowned isle , " which only occasionally reaches the level of poetry . Each of these writers had nevertheless the stuff of poetry in him . Daniel 's sonnet-sequence and Drayton 's Ballad of Agincourt are esteemed among the highest in their respective kinds . The School of Spenser Those who regarded themselves as followers of Spenser wrote with a greater seriousness than the generality of Elizabethan songsters . The work of most of them continued into an age when the high spirits of the closing years of the sixteenth century had abated , and a probing , questioning mood had succeeded . The nation was heading towards a period of political and religious strife . Some of the poets got caught up in the bitter conflict of the Civil War , others deliberately chose a life of rustic seclusion , shutting their ears to the din of controversy . They were all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our literary history mid-way between their master , Spenser , and Milton . In contrast to the earlier lyrists , who excelled in the writing of crisp , pretty airs and ditties , the poetic idiom of the Spenserians was inclined to be diffused and they easily slipped into prosiness . They made considerable use of the pastoral and allegorical conventions . Among the most prominent of this group were the brothers Giles and Phincas Fletcher . The former ( 1585 ? 1623 ) , in his Christ 's Victory and Triumph , has many passages which have the sensuous beauty of The Faerie Queene . In the Purple Island of the latter ( 1582 ? 1650 ) , the allegory of the human anatomy fails to inspire the imagination of the reader . William Browne ( 1591 ? 1643 ) was a Devonian who copied from his master the spirit of the pastoral eclogue in Britannia 's Pastorals ( 1613 ) and Shepherd 's Pipe ( 1614 ) . George Wither ( 1588 ? 1667 ) did something similar in Shepherd 's Hunting and Fair Virtue . Sir John Davies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his philosophic moods : in his Nosce Teipsum ( 1599 ) he set out the arguments for the immortality of the soul and countered the objections , thus anticipating eighteenth-century expository verse . Among the formative poets whose influence was powerful through most of the seventeenth century we have so far considered only Spenser . But there were two others , towards whom later writers of verse turned with no less admiration for their example and respect for their authority . These were Ben Jonson ( 1573 ? 1637 ) and John Donne ( 1573 ? 1631 ) . Each of them struck out in a new direction . // Ben Jonson Jonson 's lyrics are mostly contained in his plays and masques , and in two small collections : The Forest and Underwoods . In early Jacobean days he was the acknowledged mentor of literary taste , and his prestige was so great that it could survive the publication of verse marred by many lame rhymes . His attitude to poetry may be inferred from a passage in Timber where he enumerates the attributes of a poet , who should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 ) patience to exercise his art , " to bring all to the forge and file again , " ( 3 ) imitation , " to be able to convert the substance or riches of another poet to his own use , " and ( 4 ) " exactness of study and multiplicity of reading which maketh a full man . " There is little here to suggest the spontaneity of poetry : all these attributes can be brought to perfection by art . Jonson 's mind was rational , analytical and epigrammatic ; he worked towards an ideal of clarity , a quality belonging pre-eminently to prose . It is therefore not surprising that Jonson should have been acclaimed by the writers of the Augustan age ( see page 192 . ) The following example of Jonson 's verse may be studied as showing the lyrical mind of the poet at work , under the restraint of his feeling for the " majesty of art set high in spirit with the precious taste of sweet philosophy " It is not growing like a tree In bulk , doth make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three hundred year , To fall a log at last , dry , bald and sere : A lily of a day Is fairer far in May , Although it fall and die that night ; It was the plant and flower of light . In small proportions we just beauties see And in short measures life may perfect be . Jonson was the poet of " just beauties , " censorious of redundance of ornament , of disproportion of thought and expression , and of obscurity . He disciplined his verse to the severe economy and balance of the classics . John Donne John Donne ( 1S72-1631 ) was a complete rebel against the courtly poetry and the light airy madrigals of the Elizabethans , with their conventional terms of love and grief , their hackneyed conceits and // their florid prettiness . He differed from them in a number of ways . Firstly , with respect to prosodic form : he cared little for the smoothness and sweetness of the song-like lyrics which appeared in such quantities in his youth . His own versification was often harsh and knotted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Elizabethan love lyric is impersonal ; Donne " looks into his heart and writes . " Thirdly , the imagery was freshly imagined , being no longer an echo of the classical tropes which had done duty for so long . Fourthly , his urge to write was intellectual ; no parallel that his wit could conceive was too fantastic and ingenious to use . He took an intellectual pleasure in extorting from a juxtaposition of ideas all that it could yield in support of some hyperbolic fancy . The following lines are part of a poem in which one at the point of death urges that there shall be no parting or farewell Our two souls therefore , which are one , Though I must go , endure not yet A breach , but an expansion , Like gold to airy thinness beat . If they be two , they are two so As stiff twin compasses are two , Thy soul the fixt foot , makes no show To move , but doth , if th'other do . And though it in the centre sit , Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hearkens after it , And grows erect as that comes home . Such wilt thou be to me , who must Like th'other foot , obliquely run ; Thy firmness makes my circles just , And makes me end , where I begun . We have in these lines two daring images , one of friendship beaten out like gold to gossamer thinness , to bridge the span between life and death , the other concerned with the movements of the two legs of a pair of compasses . It is such " conceits " that Dryden had in mind when he coined the description " metaphysical " when discussing Abraham Cowley and other imitators of Donne . In the example given , the parallels are concrete enough ; but sometimes they are recondite and lost among abstractions . Frequently Donne lights up his themes with a brilliant white light , // and then he attains heights of creative insight and imagination as outstanding as any in the language ? Go and catch a falling star , Get with child a mandrake root , Tell me where all past years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Teach me to hear mermaid 's singing , Or to keep off envy 's stinging , And find What wind Serves to advance an honest mind . Donne has served in the history of English poetry as a touchstone of taste . Until the Restoration he was extravagantly admired . Ben Jonson declared him to be " the first poet in the world in some things " though he " for not keeping of accent deserved hanging . " His influence was strong on the religious poets of the Caroline period , one of whom , Thomas Carew , wrote an elegy on him which ended with the lines Here lies a king that ruled as he thought fit The universal monarchy of wit . More particularly the spirit of Donne was shared by the group of religious poets containing Herbert and Vaughan . John Cleveland ( 1613 ? 58 ) and Abraham Cowley ( 1618 ? 67 ) carried the taste for " conceits " to an absurd excess . Notwithstanding the considerable vogue they enjoyed as poets during the period of Puritan domination , they rank as intellectuals rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his extravagant fancy , admits Cowley to have " as much true wit as any author that ever writ , " and Dr. Johanson considered him to be the chief of the " metaphysicals . " With the cult of a new idiom of poetry in the changed atmosphere of Restoration times , Donne 's reputation suffered eclipse . Those who adopted the ideal of correctness did so largely by way of reaction against the exasperating subtleties and the broken and shapeless music of Donne and his school . For his obscurity they substituted clarity ; for his ingenuities , directness ; for his wayward passion , order ; and for his metrical ruggedness , smoothness . The neglect of Donne continued through the eighteenth century into the nineteenth century , and it is only in our generation that he has entered into his own again . Certainly his age had much in common with ours . The joyous eagerness of the Elizabethans had given place to a certain disillusionment . The fine frenzy was over . The new age was one in which it seemed that there // were no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place to endless discussion of such matters as the proper limits of the King 's prerogative . Donne has been called the true poet of a decadent age , when pessimism and brooding doubt clouded the mind . He may well be termed " metaphysical " in another sense than that which Dryden and Dr. Johnson had in mind , because his tortured mind was preoccupied with the meaning of the universe and man 's place in it , and with the problems of life and death . No circumstance in the history of literary taste in this country is more striking than the manner in which Donne has again in our own day become significant as a poet . He represents the " poetry of wit , " that is to say the poetry which uses the intellect to build up complex unities of thought out of materials which are conventionally nonpoetic . By the juxtaposition of ideas which seem at first sight unrelated and even violently discordant , and by their reconciliation in the white heat of the poet 's imagination , a more coherent and organic body of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiar comparisons . The obscurity of Donne is of the same nature as the obscurity of some of the moderns . It arises from the sudden leaps and jerks of the imagination . The effort to wrest a meaning out of intractable material at times involves the doing of violence to syntax , and the cheating of anticipations of rhythmical sequence . CHAPTER VIII CAVALIER AND PURITAN POETRY THE dominating influences on the poets known as the Caroline Lyricists were , as we have seen , those of Ben Jonson and John Donne . Their revolt against the polite conventions of the Elizabethan lyric was altogether to the taste of the younger generation , who had not directly experienced the elan of the age of Spenser , Sidney , and Shakespeare . They had a considerable vogue in the Universities and among soldiers and clergymen , who stood towards the lyric very much in the position in which Wyatt and Surrey and their following stood nearly a century earlier . These did not write as professionals for publication , but as amateurs of poetry ; nearly all of their work appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Firstly , the religious group also known as the " fantastics , " consisting of George Herbert ( 1593-1633 ) , Francis Quarles ( 1592-1644 ) , Richard Crashaw ( 1612-49 ) , Henry Vaughan ( 1622-95 ) and Thomas Traherne ( 1634-74 ) . Secondly , the Cavalier group , gallant , aristocratic men of fortune , including Thomas Carew ( 1589-1639 ) , Sir John Suckling ( 1609-42 ) and Richard Lovelace ( 1618-58 ) . Robert Herrick ( 1594-1674 ) and Abraham Cowley shared the characteristics of both groups . All these poets were Anglicans , and supported the royal cause in the struggle between King and Parliament . What these poets have of smoothness , clarity , ease and dignity they have in common with Jonson ; what they have of compactness , quick-darting imagery and subtle contortions of thought they share with Donne ; what they have of song-like quality they derive from the Elizabethans . Andrew Marvell and Edmund Waller There was one of the religious group who was on the anti-royalist side : namely Andrew Marvell ( 1621-78 ) , an official colleague of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Horatian Ode , a panegyric on Cromwell , is unequalled in its kind in English . Marvell 's verse , like that of Milton , falls easily into two Ioo CAVALIER AND PURITAN POETRY IOI divisions : his youthful poems such as To His Coy Mistress are in the spirit of the Caroline lyrists , light-hearted and " fantastic , " while in those written after the Restoration he turned towards political satire . His use of the heroic couplet for this purpose pointed the way to the Augustans . So also did his qualities of urbanity , poise , and classical detachment . A second influence which counted for much in giving a new direction to poetry was that of Edmund Waller ( 1606-87 ) . Though his life lies quite outside the reign of Elizabeth , he can in one aspect of his work be reckoned as the last of the Elizabethans . His poem Go Lovely Rose has taken its place in our literature as his best lyric . But he is particularly interesting to the literary historian because of the high polish he gave to the heroic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground that he " first made writing an art , " and this was the judgment of his time . Waller aimed above all things at " correctness . " By this was meant chiefly two things . One was smoothness and epigrammatic and antithetical force , achieved through making the unit of meaning correspond with the metrical unit of the couplet . The divisions were clearly marked by the use of strongly-stressed rhymes Stronger by weakness wiser men become As they draw near to their eternal home . Leaving the old , both worlds at once they view That stand upon the threshold of the new . The other quality aimed at was lucidity . Waller can thus be regarded as at the same time a disciple of Jonson and a critic of Donne . His taste was for verse which showed the sharply-cut features of a classical profile , and he was the acknowledged founder of the Augustan school of English poets . John Milton Milton ( 1608-1704 ) had as his background the whole body of classical and medieval European literature and history , in which he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Hebrew writings . He was moreover a child of the Renaissance , the last of the early English humanists . Notwithstanding the remark of Dryden : " Milton has acknowledged to me that Spenser was his original , " 1 it is impossible to discuss a poet of such towering genius as a member of any group or " school . " He was independent of traditions IO2 ENGLISH LITERATURE and influences except those of the widest scope . Literature was to him the serious business of life , compact with moral purpose . In the glow of his poetic imagination he fused a dogmatic Puritan outlook with a pagan feeling for sensuous beauty . The three divisions of Milton 's writing correspond chronologically with three phases of our national history : pre-Commonwealth , Commonwealth , and post-Commonwealth . To the first period belong most of his lyric and elegiac poems : The Hymn on the Nativity ( 1629 ) ; L'Allegro , Il Penseroso ( 1632 ) ; Lycidas ( 1637 ) ; and Comus ( 1634 ) . In the second he turned from poetry to polemical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it undertaken as a duty incumbent on him as Latin Secretary to Cromwell , some of it arising independently . The third phase of his writing , which occupied the blind poet from 166o till his death , consists of the two epics : Paradise Lost ( 1667 ) and Paradise Regained ( 1671 ) , and the tragedy of Samson Agonistes ( 1671 ) . Milton 's Lyrical Poetry The Hymn , written at the age of twenty-one , shows that Milton 's lyric genius was already highly developed . The sublime splendour of its conception can hardly be matched in the language , but it is possible to detect in the latter part of the poem something of the prevalent liking for " conceits , " or far-fetched images So when the sun in bed , Curtained with cloudy red , Pillows his chin upon an orient wave ... . The complementary poems L'Allegro and Il Penseroso , in octosyllabic couplets , contain delightful descriptions of rustic scenes and pastimes in Springtime and Autumn . The mood of L'Allegro is gay , positive , and active , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the classical tradition , painting an idealized picture of rural life from dawn to dusk . Il Penseroso is essentially a meditative poem , its theme being the passive joys of the contemplative life . It extols the recluse who spends his days in solitary reflection amid the calmer beauties of nature Or , if the air will not permit , Some still removed place will fit , Where glowing embers through the room Teach light to counterfeit a gloom , Far from all resort of mirth , Save the cricket on the hearth , Or the bellman 's drowsy charm To bless the doors from nightly harm . // We have in these two poems Milton 's lyrical genius at its best . The learning that they contain , whether it is of classical legend , medieval romance or English folk-lore , is no pedantic excrescence ; it is of the very stuff of the poem . Lycidas is the greatest pastoral elegy in the English language . It was written at a time when the poet was about to be caught up in the political strife which tore the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poem should reflect something of his partisanship . The grief of the poet occasioned by the death of his friend , Edward King , alternates with savage denunciation of the " hireling " clergy and regret for the loss of true religion in the State Church . The poem is in irregular metre , with six-syllabled lines frequently interspersed with lines of ten syllables ; the rhymes occur sometimes in couplets , sometimes apart Thee , Shepherd , thee the woods and desert caves , With wild thyme and the gadding vine o'ergrown , And all their echoes , mourn . The willows , and the hazel copses green , Shall now no more be seen Fanning their joyous leaves to thy soft lays . As killing as the canker to the rose , Or taint-worm to the weaning herds that graze , Or frost to flowers , that their gay wardrobe wear When first the white-thorn blows ; Such , Lycidas , thy loss to shepherd 's car . Comus ( 1634 ) marks an important stage in the development of Milton 's thought . It shows him in transition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards the greater purpose which informed his mature work . It is noticeable that he had by now abandoned rhymed for blank verse except in the songs which are interspersed in the masque . The poem shows that Milton had taken up a position strongly antagonistic to the ruling temper of Caroline society and it echoes the growing Puritan protest against its dissoluteness . Though marked by high seriousness , and didactic in aim , Comus is no tract , but one of the highest poetic achievements in our literature , in which Milton 's lyricism is enriched by a divine Philosophy Not harsh and crabbed as dull fools suppose , But musical as is Apollo 's lute And a perpetual feast of nectared sweets Where no crude surfeit reigns . // The gap of years between the poetry of these lyrics and that of the great epics is to some extent bridged by a few great sonnets such as When the Assault was intended to the City , To the Lord General Fairfax , On his Blindness , and On the Late Massacre in Piedmont , the last two being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of an emotion deeply and nobly felt . In all his sonnets Milton used the strict Petrarchan form . The Epical Works The end of Milton 's work was present in the beginning , for even in his youth he dedicated himself to preparation for the great task which was to crown his days . Not until quite late in his life did he decide upon its subject and form , save that he intended it to be of large design . His note-books show that at one time he contemplated writing an epic on the Arthurian legends , and at another he was working on drafts for a tragedy in the Greek manner with the Fall of Man as the subject . The choice of the theme of Paradise Lost was made even while he was pre-occupied with the polemics of the Commonwealth . But on Cromwell 's death in 1658 the work of composition began . Milton having become totally blind six years earlier , it was his habit to dictate a few lines daily to some member of his family or to a chance caller . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the spirit is that of the Hebrew Scriptures . The subject , Man , is seen against the Ptolemaic cosmogony . The " things unattempted yet in prose or rhyme " are the casting out from Heaven of the apostate angels , their planning of revenge in Hell , Satan 's flight , Man 's temptation and fall from grace and the promise of redemption . Against this vast background Milton projects his own philosophy of the purposes of human existence . Paradise Regained is in four books . Without rising to the heights of the greater epic , the poem nevertheless registers rather a change of mood than a decline in poetic power . The subject gives less room for sublimity and is altogether in a quieter key . It is strongest in the narrative passages . Reference is made elsewhere to the metre of the poems . Their principal ornament is the rich imagery , used to enhance the majesty of the basic conception . Much of this is contained in extended metaphors of the kind met with in classical epics , and derived from history , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // The following examples may be compared Angel Forms , who lay entranced Thick as autumnal leaves that strow the brooks In Vallombrosa , where the Etrurian shades High over-arched embower ; or scattered sedge Afloat , when with fierce winds Orion armed Hath vexed the Red-Sea coast , whose waves o'erthrew Busiris and his Memphian chivalry , While with perfidious hatred they pursued The sojourners of Goshen who beheld From the safe shore their floating carcases And broken chariot wheels . Paradise Lost I As bees In spring-time , when the Sun with Taurus rides , Pour forth their populous youth above the hive In clusters ; they among fresh dews and flowers Fly to and fro , or on the smoothed plank , The suburb of their straw-built citadel , New rubbed with balm , expatiate , and confer Their state-affairs ; so thick the aery crowd Swarmed and were straitened . Paradise Lost I CHAPTER IX AUGUSTAN POETRY THE Augustan age was so called by later literary historians because it seemed to embody some of the characteristic features of the culture of the age of the Roman Emperor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illustrious by such writers as Virgil , Horace , Ovid , and Livy . The description Augustan is rather loosely used , since it sometimes connotes the whole period from the Restoration of 166o to the middle of the eighteenth century , corresponding roughly with the age of Dryden and Pope , and sometimes is confined to a smaller part of this , namely the period of Queen Anne 's reign when the vogue of the essayists was at its height . The New Pattern The wider use of the term is justified on the ground that most of the literature produced under the late Stuarts and the early Hanoverians conformed to a new pattern of taste . It was a pattern which set less store by the imagination and more by the critical faculty . There was a decline in the primary impulses which go to the making of poetry and a falling back on the secondary . Epic poetry was displaced by satirical , argumentative or expository , lyric by epigrammatical , tragic by heroic and rhetorical . The typical man of letters was a classical scholar , ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ models bequeathed by Rome . During the Commonwealth , the living tradition of English poetry had been well-nigh forgotten . There was some neglected work by poets of an older manner , such as Robert Herrick . Milton was , in a poetic sense , almost mute . When the Restoration came , and the pulse of the nation beat normally again , a fresh start was necessary . The cultural atmosphere was changed with the return of the arbiters of taste and fashion from France , bringing with them a predilection for classical modes . The social atmosphere also was changed , as consequence of the resumption of court life , surrounded as it was by wellbred , dilettante coteries , cultivating manners as an art . A new kind of poetic inspiration was demanded , one which set a value on urbanity and good form , on order and proportion . As we have seen , there to6 // were models at hand which served to give a lead . Waller and Denham were already turning out work more or less in the disciplined and restrained manner of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more robust talent to erect a method into a system . John Dryden This talent was forthcoming in John Dryden ( 1631-1700 ) , a man of massive intellect and bold , critical judgment , who established himself as the greatest man of letters of his day . In poetry and criticism he was supreme ; in drama he was at any rate among the leaders of taste . There is hardly a figure in our literary history who can be matched against him for many-sidedness . Our concern in this section is only with his achievement in nondramatic verse . Two early poems : Heroic Stanzas ( 1658 ) , written on the death of Cromwell , and Annus Mirabilis ( 1666 ) , dealing with the Dutch War and The Fire of London , were exercises outside his true bent . They were disfigured by absurd images and false sentiment , which show clearly that Dryden was not yet master of his method While by the motion of the flames they guess What streets are burning now , and what are near , An infant , waking , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falling tear . Almost the only other non-dramatic verse he produced during the first twenty years after the Restoration consisted of the prologues to the heroic tragedies , and in these he shows his liking for the conversational idiom , without any of the affectations or tricks of versifying . He was also gaining skill in using the rhymed couplet Ladies ! ( I hope there 's none behind to hear ) I long to whisper something in your ear , A secret , which does much my mind perplex : There 's treason in the play against our sex . A man that 's false to love , that vows and cheats , And kisses every living thing he meets . Prologue to The Princess of Cleves Political Satire In 1681 Dryden turned to a new kind of poetry and at once struck a rich vein . This was political satire , and it engaged most of his energies during his middle period ( 1681-88 ) . Absalom and Achitophel was his first effort in this kind and it was received with enthusiasm . The King 's party welcomed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Io8 ENGLISH LITERATURE generally the poem was acclaimed for its brilliant satiric portraiture of such contemporary figures as the Duke of Monmouth and the Earl of Shaftesbury . The poem was quickly followed by The Medal , MacFlecknoe and Religio Laici , written in the same spirit of vigorous argument mingled with biting invective against stupid and wrongheaded opponents . In these poems the heroic couplet reached perfection . Smoothly and easily it penetrated like a steel rapier into the heart of the matter , whether this were a political doctrine or a fellow-poet 's reputation Shadwell alone of all my sons is he Who stands confirmed in full stupidity . The rest to some faint meaning make pretence , But Shadwell never deviates into sense . Some beams of wit on other souls may fall Strike through and make a lucid interval ; But Shadwell 's genuine night admits no ray ; His rising fogs prevail upon the day . The Hind and Panther , a defence of the Roman Church , followed in 1687 . The political swing to Whiggery in 1688 affected Dryden 's fortunes and he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years of his life we owe the great translations , imitations , and modernizations of earlier poets . These included the /Eneid of Virgil , the Odes of Horace , the Satires of Juvenal , and the Translations from Boccaccio and Chaucer . For his satirical poetry , on which his claim to eminence as a poet mainly rests , Dryden 's chief model was Juvenal . He and the Latin poet are alike in their vehemence , but differ in the objects of their attack . While Juvenal is a misogynist and is consumed with hatred of the social trends of his age , Dryden 's shafts are directed mainly to his personal enemies and the opinions they hold . In his Discourse concerning the Original and Progress of Satire ( 1692 ) , which he prefaced to a translation of Juvenal , he remarks that " the nicest and most delicate touches of satire consist in fine raillery . . . Neither is it true that this fineness of raillery is offensive . A witty man is tickled when he is hurt in this manner , and a fool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of satire from the " former sort . . . which is known in England by the name of lampoon . " He used a rapier rather than a bludgeon , to the end that the malefactor should " die sweetly . " It was to his credit that he recognized in the heroic couplet the weapon ideally suited for his purpose . It was clean and polished , and its use was consonant with the manners of a gentleman . // Alexander Pope The literary career of Alexander Pope ( 1688 ? 1744 ) began after Dryden 's was ended . Roughly , they are separated in time by the consummation of the Whig revolution , which established in Britain a constitutional monarchy supported by the mercantile classes , the new nobility and the Puritans . Ranged in opposition to the Hanoverians were the country gentry and the rural clergy with their flocks . As urban life developed , the reading public expanded , a circumstance of some importance for literature . While Dryden had to rely on the stage to provide him with an income , Pope was able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone . Dryden 's range was nevertheless wider , and his appeal was to a more varied circle . Pope was the poet of the Club , of the fashionable drawing-room , and of the literary circle ; his audience was made up of intellectuals , who relished his epigrammatic wit and his easy optimism . Drawing in to himself the ideas which were floating about , Pope gave them back to his world in terse and polished language , easily remembered and quoted Two principles in human nature reign : Self-love to urge , and Reason , to restrain ; Nor this a good , nor that a bad we call , Each works its end , to move or govern all : And to their proper operation still , Ascribe all Good ; to their improper Ill . Essay on Man , Epistle II After some early work , The Pastorals and Windsor Forest , which , although but prentice efforts , already show him to be an accomplished versifier , his first characteristic poem was The Essay on Criticism , published when he was twenty-four years of age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " rules " which should govern the practice of the art of poetry . The ideas are not original , being derived from Horace 's Ars Poetica and Boileau 's L'Art Poetique , but the Essay stands as a testament of English classicism . It will be useful to compare Pope 's use of the heroic couplet with Dryden 's . Dr. Johnson in his Lives of the Poets makes this comparison : " Dryden 's page is a natural field , rising into inequalities and diversified by the varied exuberance of abundant vegetation ; Pope 's is a velvet lawn , shaven by the scythe and levelled by the roller . " In another passage he says : " The method of Pope was to write his first thoughts in his first words , and gradually to amplify , decorate , rectify and IIO ENGLISH LITERATURE refine them . " The " inequalities " and " diversities " which Pope was so assiduous in removing were the use of enjambement ( or the running on of the grammatical sentence beyond the limits of the couplet ) , of the occasional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following Waller was smooth ; but Dryden taught to join The varying verse , the full resounding line , The long majestick march , and energy divine . He disliked hiatus ( or the elision of vowels ) , inversions , expletives and monosyllabic lines . Some of these faults he exemplifies in a well-known passage But most by numbers judge a Poet 's song ; And smooth or rough , with them is right or wrong : In the bright Muse though thousand charms conspire , Her voice is all these tuneful fools admire ; Who haunt Parnassus but to please their ear , Not mend their minds ; as some to Church repair , Not for the doctrine , but the music there . These equal syllables alone require , Tho ' oft the ear the open vowels tire ; While expletives their feeble aid do join ; And ten low words oft creep in one dull line : While they ring round the same unvary 'd chimes , With sure returns of still expected rhymes ; Where-e 're you find " the cooling western breeze , " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " : If crystal streams " with pleasing murmurs creep , " The reader 's threaten 'd ( not in vain ) with " sleep " : Then at the last and only couplet fraught With some unmeaning thing they call a thought , A needless Alexandrine ends the song That , like a wounded snake , drags its slow length along ; Leave such to tune their own dull rhymes , and know What 's roundly smooth or languishingly slow ; And praise the easy vigour of a line , Where Denham 's strength , and Waller 's sweetness join . True ease in writing comes from art , not chance , As those move easiest who have learned to dance . Essay on Criticism It was by the shedding of such " exuberances " that Pope sought to achieve " correctness . " He added to the clipped effect of his verse by keeping the caesura within narrow bounds , usually after the fourth , AUGUSTAN POETRY III fifth or sixth syllable , and often using the two halves of his lines for antithesis Poets themselves must fall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mute the tuneful tongue . Elegy to the Memory of an Unfortunate Lady His rhymes are made to fall mostly on monosyllables , so that they may have the maximum of stress and accentuate the " clinch " of the couplet . Another work of Pope 's early period was The Rape of the Lock ( 1712 ) , the best example in English of the mock-heroic ? " filigree-work , " as Hazlitt called it . It is an exquisite piece of raillery and wit , so perfect in form that the delight it affords the reader even to-day is unfailing . The following passage from Canto II ( there are five Cantos ) describes the supplication of the " advent'rous Baron , " intent on winning the lock of Belinda 's hair For this , ere Phoebus rose , he had implor 'd Propitious heav'n , and ev'ry pow'r ador 'd , But chiefly Love ? to Love an Altar built , Of twelve vast French Romances , neatly gilt . There lay three garters , half a pair of gloves ; And all the trophies of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , And breathes three am'rous sighs to raise the fire . Then prostrate falls , and begs with ardent eyes Soon to obtain , and long possess the prize : The pow'rs gave ear , and granted half his pray'r ; The rest the winds dispers 'd in empty air . The translations of Homer 's Iliad and Odyssey established Pope 's reputation and fortune . Dr. Johnson said of the Iliad : " It is certainly the noblest version of poetry which the world has ever seen ; and its publication must therefore be considered as one of the greatest events in the annals of learning . " Again a comparision with Dryden 's translation of Virgil 's . ? neid is suggested . Modern criticism takes the view that , Dryden 's genius being closer to Homer 's and Pope 's to Virgil 's it would have been better had the two translators chosen differently . The resourcefulness of the poet is shown by the production , even while he was busy on The Iliad , of two such finished elegiac poems as Eloisa to Abelard and the Elegy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LITERATURE Pope 's attention was directed towards satire and polemics partly by the example of Swift , Arbuthnot , Gay , Congreve , and others whom he used to meet at the Scriblerus Club , and partly through a disposition to misanthropy fed by brooding on wrongs done to him by jealous literary competitors . Members of the Scriblerus Club had joined in a " scheme to ridicule all false tastes in learning . " In 1728 appeared Pope 's Dunciad , a satire on pretentious dullness , in which Theobald , who had published an important work of criticism , Shakespeare Restored , was enthroned as King of the Dunces . The satire includes an element of personal spleen , but also there was sound castigation of bad manners in literature . Pope carried on in a vein of satirical moralizing and philosophizing with his Epistles , Satires , Moral Essays , and The Essay on Man , which occupied the last ten years of his life . Pope 's reputation has passed through many vicissitudes . The tide of a new romanticism which had begun to flow even during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one except Byron in the full flood of the Romantic Movement to speak for him . But he has found in our own day many readers , sensitive to form and proportion in poetry , who place him high among English poets , if not in the first rank . The essential beauty of his poetry , which is the beauty dependent on restraint and on the " expected resolution " ( as with the music of Mozart ) , is now appreciated . Although Pope represents in our literature the spirit of elegance and urbanity , this is by no means a complete measure of his range of thought and feeling . He could command the tragic as well as the satiric mood , and had a passionate hatred of sham and corruption . He was an apostle of intellectual and moral integrity . The following passage from Epistle III of the Moral Essays illustrates Pope 's realism In the worst inn 's worst room , with mat half-hung , The floors of plaister , and the walls of dung , On once a flock-bed , but repair 'd with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draw , The George and Garter dangling from that bed Where tawdry yellow strove with dirty red , Great Villiers lies ? alas ! how changed from him , That life of pleasure , and that soul of whim ! . . . No Wit to flatter left of all his store ! No Fool to laugh at , which he valu 'd more . There Victor of his health , of fortune , friends , And fame , this lord of useless thousands ends . CHAPTER X THE APPROACH TO ROMANTICISM IN POETRY W E have now to trace the course of the gradual , but progressive recovery of imaginative power in literature . Changes in literary modes do not occur abruptly , nor are these modes , when established , so dominant that there are no writers who remain unaffected by them . Long before the Augustan principles of Reason and Correctness came to be challenged on a broad front , a new spirit was beginning to be felt in poetry . It was not that poetry had any new tricks to learn ; but values which Pope and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There were deeper cords in the heart to be stirred than the poetry of wit had been able to touch . Aesthetic taste swings from delight in form to delight in feeling and back again like a pendulum . Greatness in art can be reached along either the classical or the romantic path . " In its central nature , great art is at once romantic and classical , yet characteristically neither . It has the virtues of both . " 1 When either principle is urged too far , it begins to engender forces which favour its opposite , and a reaction is inevitable . We can distinguish three prominent features of the movement towards the second great outburst of romanticism in our literature : the return to Nature , the return to Feeling , and the return to Romance . These were linked expressions of a single poetic mood in conflict with tired conventions . The Return to Nature Pope , as we have seen , used the term " Nature " in a special sense to imply the view of the world which we attain by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by our intuition . He and other neo-classic poets opposed " Nature " to fantasy , extravagance , exaggeration , and all that was unbalanced and uncontrolled ( or , in the parlance of the eighteenth century , " enthusiastic " ) . The Romantics used the word in quite other meanings . One was that expressed by Byron in the lines ' Gotshalk : Art and the Social Order ( Univ . of'Chicago Press ) , p. 224. 114 // There is a pleasure in the pathless woods , There is a rapture on the lonely shore , There is society where none intrudes , By the deep Sea , and music in its roar ; I love not Man the less , but Nature more , From these our interviews , in which I steal From all I may be , or have been before , To mingle with the Universe , and feel What I can ne'er express , yet can not all conceal . Childe Harold , Canto IV Here it is the world without Man and his works . Another meaning underlies much of Wordsworth 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which refuses to yield up its secrets to conscious reasoning , but which may sometimes be illuminated in flashes of insight That blessed mood In which the burden of the mystery , In which the heavy and the weary weight Of all this unintelligible world , Is lightened . WORDSWORTH : Tintern Abbey According to this view , " the inward eye " reveals truths beyond the reach of the intellect . Romantic poetry finds its themes and its inspiration therefore in the countryside rather than in the town , in the simple faith of childhood rather than in sophisticated manners , in primitive elemental things rather than in a refined civilization . A supreme poet like the Milton of L'Allegro and II Penseroso could include all these things in a single imaginative apprehension of life . The earliest eighteenth-century poet to use in his work a first-hand observation of nature was James Thomson ( I7oo-48 ) . In The Seasons he shows himself deeply sensitive to the moods of the sky , the fields , the woods and the brooks , and enters fully into the delights of out-ofdoor sports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mere background to human life , but as having their own life But let not on thy hook the tortured worm Convulsive twist in agonizing folds . Thomson , by using blank verse , goes back to the Miltonic tradition , but he is at the same time subject to the influences of his own time insofar as he succumbs to the vogue of artificial periphrases , and avoids the straightforward and concrete word : thus fish are " the finny drove , " birds " the feathered tribe , " and frost " the rigid influence . " // Every object named has to have its conventional epithet : " the dimpled water , " " the shelving shore , " " the shadowy clouds , " " the pendant trees , " " the barbed hook . " There is something of the Miltonic manner in this too , but while Milton was using sonorous latinized epithets in the grand style appropriate to the sublimity of his theme There lands the Fiend , a spot like which perhaps Astronomer in the Sun 's lucent orb Through his glazed optic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were less elevated , had no such justification . In The Castle of Indolence , Thomson employs the dream-allegory so popular in medieval literature and he was wise enough to choose the Spenserian stanza as his medium . The poem represents a still bolder break with the current mood . Such a passage as the following gives us vague outlines and dim suggestions which would have meant little to a writer of the Augustan school Full in the passage of the vale , above , A sable , silent , solemn forest stood ; Where nought but shadowy forms were seen to move , As Idless fancied in her dreaming mood : And up the hills , on either side , a wood Of blackening pines , aye waving to and fro , Sent forth a sleepy horror through the blood ; And where this valley winded out below , The murmuring main was heard , and scarcely heard , to flow . THOMSON : The Castle of Indolence The Return to Feeling : Gray and Collins The second prominent feature of the reaction was the return to feeling or sentiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various than the gamut of human emotions . The note of the Augustan writers was one of emotional restraint ; a tight rein was kept on any manifestation of deep feeling . The publication of John Dyer 's poem , Grongar Hill ( 1726 ) , in the metre and spirit of Il Penseroso Grongar , in whose mossy cells Sweetly musing Quiet dwells : Grongar in whose silent Shade For the modest Muses made , So oft I have , the Even still , At the fountain of a Rill Sat upon a flowery Bed , With my Hand beneath my Head . // and more particularly of Edward Young 's Night Thoughts ( 1742 ) , showed that there were more vibrant chords ready to be touched . The latter poem , in blank verse , dealing with death and immortality , is gloomy in the extreme . Yet its extraordinary popularity , both in England and on the Continent , suggests that it matched the spirit of melancholy brooding which for some time past had been abroad . It accounts for the frequency with which twilight and evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mood is found again in Thomas Gray 's Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard , and in William Collins 's Ode to Evening Now air is hush 'd save where the weak-eyed bat With short shrill shriek flits by on leathern wing , Or where the beetle winds His small but sullen horn .. . Solitude and quietude are valued by these poets because they afford opportunity for the contemplative life . In Europe a whole literature sprang up associated with the cult of seclusion and melancholy , taking many forms , sedate , mystical or ecstatic . The supreme expression of this mood was the German romance : Werthers Leiden ( The Sorrows of Werther ) , written by Goethe in 1774 , but the impulse came from England . The novels of Richardson had given a strong lead to the literature of sentiment or Schwdrmerei ( meaning the over-indulgence of emotion ) , and Sterne 's Sentimental Journey , which dealt less with the writer 's observations than with his feelings , followed by Mackenzie 's Man of Feeling , had confirmed the vogue . The poetry of nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age of antiquity , when the virtues of simplicity and human equality were thought to govern conduct . Collins ends The Passions with the lines 0 bid our vain endeavours cease , Revive the just designs of Greece , Return in all thy simple state , Confirm the talcs her sons relate ! This heralds the revolutionary strain of Rousseauism , which was to be heard through the whole of later romantic poetry from Burns to Byron and Shelley . Rousseau maintained that man in the " state of nature " was good , because as such his behaviour was regulated only by instinctive feeling . He postulated an earlier simple society , free from the perversions to which modern civilization gave rise , and held up the " noble savage " as the happiest and wisest of mankind . This I18 ENGLISH LITERATURE idealization of primitive simplicity had a profound effect , not only on political thinking , but on literature also . The Return to Romance The third aspect of the reaction against the spirit of Augustan poetry we have called the turn to Romance . This too found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against canons of taste based on the example of the classical writers . But fundamentally , it was a turning away from sophistication ' T is fancy 's land to which thou sett'st thy feet ; Where still , ' t is said , the fairy people meet . Collins in these lines from his Ode on the Popular Superstitions of the Highlands of Scotland was urging the claims of " themes of simple , sure effect " on the poet 's attention . While he looked to Scotland , Gray looked to Wales and Iceland as lands of " fancy . " The Bard is inspired by Welsh medieval legend and The Descent of Odin by Norse tradition . The Rowley Poems by the Bristol boy , Thomas Chatterton ( 17570 ) , written in pseudo-Chaucerian English , and fictitiously claimed to be the work of a fifteenth-century monk , are , notwithstanding the forgery , evidence of the strong appeal of medievalism or , as it was generally called , " the Gothick " His cloak was all of Lincoln cloth so fine , With a gold button fastened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twine , And his shoe 's peak a loverde 's might have been ; Full well it shewn he thoughten cost no sin . The trammels of his palfrey pleased his sight , For the horse-milliner his head with roses dight . An Excellente Balade of Charitee The publication of Bishop Percy 's Reliques of Ancient Poetry in I765 contributed greatly to the romantic mood by reviving interest in our ballad literature . The ancient ballads were instinct with those qualities of nature , feeling , and romance , which were now rising so strongly to recognition in poetry , and although Percy was apologetic about his work , as being " among the levities ( I had almost said follies ) of my youth , " he helped to release the pent-up spirit of lyric poetry . The " Gothick " These expressions of the Gothic spirit belong principally to the decade 1760-1770 , and it was then also that the strange outpourings // called the Works of Ossian astonished the literary world . James Macpherson ( 1738-96 ) was a Scottish schoolmaster who published selections of what purported to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century Celtic hero . The originals on which these renderings were said to be based were never in fact produced , and it is probable that Macpherson had woven into a romance of his own various scattered elements of Celtic folk-lore . The style was a kind of rhapsodical prose , impregnated with moonlight melancholy and ghostly romantic suggestion Nathos is on the deep , and Althos , that beam of youth . Ardan is near his brothers . They move in the gloom of their course . The sons of Usnoth move in darkness , from the wrath of Cairbar of Erin . Who is that , dim by their side ? The night has covered her beauty ! Her robe streams in dusky wreaths . She is like the fair spirit of heaven in the midst of his shadowy mist . Whether these prose-poems were in fact translations , or adaptations , or downright forgeries ( as Dr. Johnson was convinced ) , it is not of the greatest moment to decide . What it is important for the student of literature to appreciate is their widespread influence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and for a time he out-topped even Shakespeare in reputation . Schools of Ossianic poetry and prose romance arose in a dozen languages . Wordsworth , looking back on this period half a century later , wrote : " Whatever men may now think of them , there can not be a doubt that these mountain monotones took the heart of Europe with a new emotion , and prepared it for that passion for mountains which has since possessed it . " 1 The " return to romance " is sometimes described as the " renascence of wonder . " Along with the revival of romance there arose a cult of the supernatural . We have seen how in Collins and Gray superstitious legend was exploited for poetic purposes , but these were only early examples . Ossian is full of the mystery of waste lands . The " Gothic " novel ( see page 225 ) , beginning with Horace Walpole 's Castle of Otranto ( 1764 ) , is largely concerned with the world which is beyond experience . It was , however , in the work of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that metaphysical poetry found its most potent expression . " The revolt of the eighteenth century , " wrote G. K. Chesterton , " did not merely release naturalism , but a certain // kind of supernaturalism also . And of this particular kind of supernaturalism , Blake is particularly the heir . " ' William Blake In some of his work , including Songs of Innocence and Songs of Experience which contain the poems Little Lamb , who made thee ? and Tiger , Tiger burning bright , it is the surprising lyrical quality which compels our admiration . But in another part of his work , known as the " prophetic " writings , The Book of The ! , Marriage of Heaven and Hell and others , he expresses his meaning in terms of elaborate transcendental cosmogonies , which have affinities with the Swedenborgian conceptions of the nature of the universe . With Blake , English poetry finally shook itself free of Augustan influences . Not a trace of their spirit remained . In the Prophetic Poems there is no rhyme , and the measure is a kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thou fair-hair 'd angel of the evening .. . Smile on our loves and while thou drawest the Blue curtains of the sky , scatter thy silver dew On every flower that shuts its sweet eyes In timely sleep . and again Fearing that Albion should turn his back against the Divine vision , Los took his globe of fire to search the interior of Albion 's Bosom , in all the terrors of friendship , entering the caves Of despair and death , to search the tempters out , walking among Albion 's rocks and precipices , caves of solitude and dark despair . In language such as this Blake indulges his gift of inspired , or as T. S. Eliot calls it , hallucinated vision . Robert Burns Robert Burns ( 1759 ? 96 ) was not so completely emancipated . He wrote in two idioms , one Scots , one English . He can , strangely enough , change from the one to the other within the same poem and even in successive stanzas Wee , sleekit , cow'rin , tim'rous beastie , O what a panic 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hasty , Wi ' bickering brattle ! I wad be laith to rin an ' chase thee Wi ' murd-ring pattle . ' G. K. Chesterton : William Blake . THE APPROACH TO ROMANTICISM IN POETRY I2I I 'm truly sorry man 's dominion Has broken Nature 's social union , An ' justifies that ill opinion Which makes thee startle At me vernacular , in the other artificial sentiment cast in the mould of rhetoric . Yet notwithstanding the hold which the eighteenth century had on him , Burns is to be reckoned as belonging to the new movement . He lived close to nature and believed in human dignity and equality A man 's a man for a ' that . Romanticism had , as we have seen , a political side , and even before the French Revolution had given it a creed and a programme , Burns was possessed by its spirit . He was romantic , too , in his rejection of prudential motives and his submission to instinctive feeling . His poems match his impassioned moods ; his large-heartedness made him acutely sensitive to cruelty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a lyric gift , an ear for melody in verse , which made his Songs among the greatest we have . William Cowper Two other writers who were active late in the century can be counted among those who represent the middle phase in the movement towards romanticism . One was William Cowper ( I73 I-1800 ) , a pious recluse of unstable mind , often tortured by religious obsessions , but in periods of normal mental health a genial , kindly soul . He is known to literature chiefly by his private letters , which are characterized by great charm of expression . His poetry also has its place in the movement of reaction against classicism . In much of it he used a conventional diction but he had command of another style as well , as in To Mary Thy needles , once a shining store , For my sake restless heretofore , Now rust disused , and shine no more , My Mary ! For though thou gladly wouldst fulfil The same kind office for me still , Thy sight now seconds not thy will , My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blank verse to describe homely scenes and the pleasures and pains of simple humanity . He is a master of the serio-comic manner , as shown in John Gilpin . His poetry was written from the heart , and much of it had an autobiographical interest . George Crabbe The other was George Crabbe ( 1754-1832 . He too stood midway between the Augustans and the Romantics . In diction he inclined to the former ; in the temper of his mind and in his realism he may be reckoned with the latter . He used the heroic couplet much on the approved pattern , though with less precision Darkness begins to reign ; the louder wind Appals the weak and awes the firmer mind . But frights not him , whom evening and the spray In part conceal ? yon Prowler on his way . A large number of lines show enjambment . But it is in his attitude to nature and to feeling that Crabbe is to be classed with Cowper . Each of them described nature at first hand rather than bookishly , and each employed the pathetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the countryside Yes , thus the Muses sing of happy swains , Because the Muses never knew their pains : They boast their peasants ' pipes ; but peasants now Resign their pipes and plod behind the plough ; And few , amid the rural-tribe have time To number syllables and play with rhyme . CRABBE : The Village Nature was thus no longer a literary accessory . It was at least on the way to becoming what it was in the poetry of Wordsworth : a " presence , " " a motion and a spirit , " and " the soul of all my moral being , " in a mystical union with man . Samuel Johnson Notwithstanding the effort made by Thomson in The Seasons to break away from it , the reign of the heroic couplet stretched out for some years longer because of the support given to it by Samuel Johnson ( 1709-84 ) . An uncompromising classicist , he found in satire his most congenial theme . He was didactic and sententious , but as the objects of his scorn were manners rather than people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pope . In his two satires London // and The Vanity of Human Wishes , Juvenal was translated into terms of modern life . The verse exhibits the characteristic diction of rhetorical poetry in full play personification : Here Beauty falls betray 'd , despis 'd , distress 'd And hissing Infamy proclaims the rest . antithesis : See nations slowly wise and meanly just To buried merit raise the tardy bust ; slurred syllables : To Int'rest , Prudence : and to Flatt'ry , Pride ; tautological expression : Let observation , with extensive view Survey mankind , from China to Peru ; epigram : To point a moral or adorn a tale ; classical allusion and invocation : Once more , Democritus , arise on earth ; paradox : With cheerful wisdom and instructive mirth ; rhetorical question : But did not Chance at length her error mend ? Did no subverted empire mark his end ? conventional adjectives : passing world , triumphal show , regal palace . In general , the idiom is latinized . The abstract is preferred to the concrete , giving us such impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contagion of the gown " and " congratulating Conscience . " Music is described as " the tuneful levities of pain . " In short we have not poetry but rhetoric . These examples can be multiplied from the poets of the eighteenth century , who were imitating the sonorous diction of Milton , but using it for unsuitable purposes . There are passages in Johnson in which his style is vigorous and pungent , and free from such faults , as in the following from London , where he is describing the dangers of the streets ? // Prepare for death , if here at night you roam , And sign your will before you sup from home . Some fiery fop , with new commission vain , Who sleeps on brambles till he kills his man ; Some frolick drunkard , reeling from a feast , Provokes a broil , and stabs you for a jest . Oliver Goldsmith Oliver Goldsmith ( 1730- ' 74 ) used the heroic couplet with more grace . He wore his classicism with a difference , for its ideals of correctness and restraint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked out on the world with tolerant humour and sensibility . In The Traveller and The Deserted Village , which together represent the greater part of his poetical output , the verse is handled still with true eighteenth-century lucidity , but it is warm with human sympathy and gentle irony . The monotony of the abstract diction is varied by touches of realism The white-washed wall , the nicely sanded floor , The vanish 'd clock that click 'd behind the door ; The chest contriv 'd a double debt to pay , A bed by night , a chest of drawers by day ; The pictures plac 'd for ornament and use , The twelve good rules , the royal game of goose . Goldsmith 's independence is further shown by his use of a cantering anapaestic measure for his short poem The Retaliation , in which he gives us imperishable portraits of his friends and associates , such as this of Edmund Burke Here lies our good Edmund , whose genius was such , We scarcely can praise it , or blame it too much ; Who , born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party gave up what was meant for mankind . CHAPTER XI THE AGE OF ROMANTICISM THE full flowering of Romanticism took place in the quartercentury which lies between the publication of the Lyrical Ballads of Wordsworth and Coleridge in 1798 , and the death of Keats in 1821 , of Shelley in 1822 , and of Byron in 1824 . Wordsworth , although he lived on until 1850 , had completed all his important poetical work by 1814 . Similarly all the great poems of Coleridge , who died in 1834 , were written within the short space of time when he was closely associated with Wordsworth , that is , between 1797 and 1803 . Southey , too , had completed his main work in poetry by 1822 , and thereafter concerned himself mainly with prose . We can classify the poets of the high romantic age as ( 1 ) the lake school , consisting of Wordsworth , Coleridge and Southey , ( 2 ) the Scott group , including Campbell and Moore , and ( 3 ) the group comprising Byron , Shelley , and Keats . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that we have two eight-year flood periods of supremely great poetry , namely 1798-1806 and 1816-1824 , separated by a middle period when by comparison creative energy had ebbed . The Lake Poets The Lake Poets formed a " school " in the sense that they worked in close collaboration . Wordsworth had already published his Poems written in Youth and completed The Borderers ( in which he rejected the philosophy of the French Revolution ) , before his long association with Coleridge began in Somerset . After a joint visit to Germany in 1798 , Wordsworth made a new home in Grasmere , and within two or three years Coleridge and Southey became his near neighbours at Keswick . Southey was not himself distinguished by creative imagination , and supported rather than added to what the more original genius of the other two had achieved . The literary revolution which we associate with their names had in fact been accomplished by 1800 , when the second edition of the Lyrical Ballads appeared , with an expanded statement of the critical doctrines of the authors in the preface . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his Biographia Literaria ( 1817 ) During the first year that Mr. Wordsworth and I were neighbours , our conversations turned frequently on the two cardinal points of poetry : the power of exciting the sympathy of the reader by a faithful adherence to the truth of nature , and the power of giving the interest of novelty by the modifying colours of imagination . . . . The thought suggested itself that a series of poems might be composed of two sorts . In the one , the incidents and agents were to be , in part at least , supernatural ; and the excellence aimed at was to consist in the interesting of the affections by the dramatic truth of such emotions as would naturally accompany such situations , supposing them real . . . . For the second class , subjects were to be chosen from ordinary life ; the characters and incidents were to be such as will be found in every village and its vicinity , where there is a meditative and feeling mind to seek after them , or to notice them , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Lyrical Ballads ; in which it was agreed that my endeavours should be directed to persons and characters supernatural . . . . Mr. Wordsworth on the other hand , was . . . to give charm of novelty to things of every day . That explains the framework ; as for the style , we may refer to the famous Preface , wherein Wordsworth says that the poems were published as an experiment which , I hoped , might be of some use to ascertain how far , by fitting to metrical arrangement a selection of the real language of men in a state of vivid sensation , that sort of pleasure and that quantity of pleasure may be imparted , which a poet may rationally endeavour to impart . In particular Wordsworth had in mind the language actually spoken by peasants and such as lived closest to nature , claiming that their direct and artless expressions of feeling were nearer to poetry than the speech of educated people . Low and rustic life was generally chosen , because in that condition the essential passions of the heart fmd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are less under restraint , and speak a plainer and more emphatic language . Wordsworth was thus making a protest against the use of an artificial " poetic diction . " He declared " there neither is , nor can be , any essential difference between the language of prose and metrical composition . " He entered upon his poetic career in the spirit of a crusader , convinced that this duty called him to lift poetry up from the condition of " depravity " to which it had sunk . A new spirit was needed to restore the true values of poetry . He amplified his point of view by quoting a sonnet of Thomas // Gray , a poet whom he considered more than any other " curiously elaborate in the structure of his own poetic diction " In vain to me the smiling mornings shine , And reddening Phoebus lifts his golden fire : The herds in vain their amorous descant join , Or cheerful fields resume their green attire . These ears , alas ! for other notes repine ; A different object do these eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; And in my breast the imperfect joys expire ; Yet morning smiles the busy race to cheer , And new-born pleasure brings to happier men ; The fields to all their wonted tribute bear ; To warm their little loves the birds complain . I fruitless mourn to him that can not hear , And weep the more because I weep in vain and adds this comment It will easily be perceived that the only part of this Sonnet which is of any value is the lines quoted in Italics : it is equally obvious that , except in the rhyme , and in the use of the single word fruitless ' for fruitlessly , which is so far a defect , the language of these lines does in no respect differ from that of prose . Wordsworth thus makes it clear that what he has in mind when he writes of " the language of prose and metrical composition " is the diction which is " the very language of men , " free from the mechanical devices consciously used to elevate the style , " a family language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by prescription . " Wordsworth 's Poetry While Wordsworth on the whole succeeded in his mission , it can not be said that his practice corresponded at all times with his theory . He achieved here and there a nobility of utterance , in language that was simple and free from artifice , but often in the quest for plainness , his inspiration failed him , and the result was banal . Examples of such banality have already been given ( see p. 26 ) . They suggest that no sound theory of poetic language can ever be erected upon a merely negative consideration ? the avoidance of this or that in diction . Wordsworth admits that ideas should be " expressed in language fitted to their respective importance , " and remarks : " If the Poet 's subject be judiciously chosen , it will naturally , and upon fit occasion , lead him to passions the language of which , if selected truly and I28 ENGLISH LITERATURE judiciously , must necessarily be dignified and variegated , and alive with metaphors and figures . " This is the justification for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a poem as the Ode on Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of Early Childhood . In such lines as The cataracts blow their trumpets from the steep ; No more shall grief of mine the seasons wrong ; I hear the Echoes through the mountains throng , The Winds come to me from the fields of sleep And all the earth is gay . There are no words other than those one might readily use in prose and no poetic dialect . Yet the characteristic note of his poetry is to be found , in fact , not so much in the poems written to his prescription of high thinking and plain writing , but in those in which he gives philosophic expression to the two deep convictions which possessed his soul . The one , a belief in the essential dignity of man , will be found in such a poem as Michael ; the other is a sense of serenity and power , both moral and intellectual , flowing into his being from Nature I had been taught to reverence a Power That is the visible quality and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This means for Wordsworth much more than the simple naturalism of Rousseau . His " right reason " is a pantheistic philosophy , based on a belief in the one-ness of nature ( including man ) And I have felt A presence that disturbs me with the joy Of elevated thoughts ; a sense sublime Of something far more deeply interfused , Whose dwelling is the light of setting suns , And the round ocean and the living air , And the blue sky , and in the mind of man , A motion and a spirit , that impels All thinking things , all objects of all thought , And rolls through all things . Tintern Abbey Primarily , Wordsworth was a nature mystic , and his great power was his ability to communicate his mystical experiences in poetry . The Prelude is a retrospective account of the stages by which Wordsworth 's mind matured , passing from the revolutionary ardour of // youth , through disillusionment , to withdrawal into a life of contemplation . He planned a vast edifice of poetry to be called The Recluse , likening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " with which his minor pieces were to stand in comparison like " cells , oratories , and sepulchral recesses . " Of this " long and laborious work " only the middle part , " the anti-chapel , " called The Excursion , was actually accomplished . The theme was " the sensations and opinions of a poet living in retirement . " Unfortunately , by the time this project was formed , Wordsworth 's creative urge had weakened . The Excursion contains long passages of pedestrian verse of a laboured " moralistic " kind , relieved only occasionally by genuine spontaneous poetry . The philosophy in it counted for more than the imagination , the judgment more than the feeling . Wordsworth 's standing as one of the half-dozen major English poets must not be supposed to rest upon the validity of a theory of poetic diction , or upon the truth of a philosophic system . Ultimately it can rest only upon the absolute power of his poems to produce the kind of aesthetic pleasure which we look for from poetry . We may nevertheless distinguish certain of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : firstly , his vision of the beneficent forces of Nature which , wedded with the creative imagination , yields spiritual health and consolation , peace and cheerfulness to the mind exposed to their ministration " with a wise passiveness ; " secondly , his discovery of the emotional quality in the lives and speech of rustic folk ; thirdly , his sense of the wonder and romance of Old , unhappy , far-off things And battles long ago ; and fourthly , his passion for human freedom , as expressed in some of his Sonnets , e.g. Two Voices are there ; one is of the sea , One of the mountains ; each a mighty Voice : In both from age to age thou didst rejoice , They were thy chosen music , Liberty ! Coleridge The genius of Samuel Taylor Coleridge ( 1772-1834 ) was complementary to that of Wordsworth . While the prevailing mood of the latter was loftily reflective , his art controlled and disciplined , his purposes defined and steadily pursued , the poetic mind of Coleridge // was less restrained . His imagination carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the light that never was on sea or land . " Of these he gave us but transitory glimpses , for his visions quickly faded . Coleridge 's principal contribution to The Lyrical Ballads was The Ancient Mariner , a poem unique in literature , where pure fantasy unites with verbal melody and dramatic intensity in a poetic amalgam so subtly concocted as to defy all analysis . The other great poems which establish his place as a lyrical poet are Christabel and Kubla Khan , each of them a witchery of word-music , and each of them quite essentially romantic , the nearest things we have to " pure poetry . " There is not in either poem a sound or image to disturb the atmosphere of faerie . Here the rational yields place to the irrational , the consequent to the inconsequent . The logic is not that of the syllogism ; it is of a different order . Their coherence and lucidity belong entirely to the world of dreams . If we but accommodate ourselves within the " frame of reference " and yield ourselves willingly to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give absolute credence to all that happens . Though these three poems , and a few shorter ones ( e.g. Love ) are all of Coleridge 's poetical work that really matters , it is he rather than Wordsworth who influenced the younger group of romantic poets . It was not that his contemporaries were immediately held by the witchery of the Ancient Mariner when it appeared . Most of them were at first unresponsive , and even hostile . Coleridge 's influence was exerted through his critical prose , consisting of essays , lectures and miscellanies , in which he expounds ( without accepting ) the Wordsworthian thesis , and develops his own philosophical conception of the nature of poetry . Southey Of Southey little need be said ; his talent was purely derivative , and although he borrowed the trapping of the romantics , he lacked the higher qualities of poetry . Early in life he formed grandiose plans for encompassing the outstanding mythologies of the world in a series of epic poems . But he was without the intellectual grasp , to say nothing of the poetic sympathy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relieved by some fine rhetoric . Thalaba , Madoc , Roderick were portions of the task he set himself , and The Vision of Judgment is notable because it drew a mischievous parody from Byron under the same title . // The Scott Group Sir Walter Scott ( 1771 ? 1832 ) was caught up in the romantic movement through an antiquarian love of old English ballads and through an interest in German poetry of the Sturm and Drang tradition , which corresponded to the " Gothic revival " in our literature and art . Starting as a translator and a collector , he applied a talent for writing stirring rhymes to historical subjects which caught his imagination . The Lay of the Last Minstrel was his first full narrative of Border chivalry , and this was followed by Marmion , The Lady of the Lake , Rokeby , The Lord of the Isles , and others in similar vein . These poems represented something new in romanticism ? storytelling in verse , with vivid descriptions of feudal customs , supernatural solicitings , love and adventure , flavoured with a touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Coleridge described as follows : " The metre is not properly speaking irregular though it may seem so from its being founded on a new principle : namely , that of counting in each line the accents , not the syllables . Though the latter may vary from seven to twelve , yet in each line the accents will be found to be only four . " And Christabel saw the lady 's eye , And nothing else saw she thereby , Save the boss of the shield of Sir Leoline tall , Which hung in a murky old niche in the wall . " 0 softly tread , " said Christabel , " My father seldom sleepeth well . " The following passage of The Lady will show how Scott used this accentual metre The Ladye steps in doubt and dread , Lest her watchful mother heard her tread ; The Ladye caresses the rough blood-hound , Lest his voice should waken the castle round ; The watchman 's bugle is not blown , For he was her foster-father 's son ; And she glides through the greenwood at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own true Knight . Scott , in an estimate of his own poems , said that what merit they had was in " a hurried frankness of composition which pleases soldiers , sailors , and young people of bold and active disposition . " He popularized romanticism , and created a reading public of his own , more numerous and nation-wide than any of our poets had reached . After 181$ Scott wrote little poetry and turned to the prose-romance. // The vogue of Scott stimulated a host of lesser poets to attempt versified romance ; among them the most successful in their day were Thomas Campbell and Thomas Moore . Campbell wrote Gertrude of Wyoming in Spenserian stanzas , but it is his patriotic warsongs which have survived : e.g. Ye Mariners of England , Hohenlinden and The Battle of the Baltic , and ballads such as Lord Ullin 's Daughter . Moore established himself as a poet by starting the publication of a long series of Irish Melodies , words written to music , vivacious or sentimental . He then turned to the luscious imagery of Oriental tales , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his work consisted of literary squibs and satires . His popularity in his day was enormous , but it survives principally in Ireland . The Second Blossoming of Romanticism The three poets Scott , Campbell , and Moore bridged the years which preceded the second outburst of high creative activity in this age of romantic literature . Lord Byron ( 1788-1824 ) , though he had already , in his satiric English Bards and Scotch Reviewers ( 1809 ) , gained a reputation for invective in the style of The Dunciad , leapt into sudden fame three years later with the appearance of the first two cantos of Childe Harold . This poem was a running commentary on travels in Europe , written in the Spenserian stanza , interesting not only because it touched on places and people of contemporary interest but also because it revealed a new type of romantic personality . Byron followed up his early success with melodramatic tales of Eastern crime , intrigue and battle , The Gaiour , The Corsair , Lara , and The Siege of Corinth , dashed off in periods reckoned in days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight years which remained to him after his quitting England in 1816 with scorn and bitterness in his heart . Thereupon he threw himself tempestuously into the wider world , intent on savouring love and life and art and war without reck or heed of conventional morality or prudence . His combination of misanthropy with passion and egoism produced in his readers a kind of mental intoxication , extraordinarily acceptable to the taste of the age , and Byron has remained ever since in the imagination of Europe the dynamic Englishman and , as a poet , second only to Shakespeare . In 1816-17 Childe Harold was completed . Beppo , a Venetian story in serio-comic vein , followed . For this he used an adaptation of the Italian ottava rima , or stanza of eight eleven-syllabled lines ( see page S4 ) . Byron reduced the line to ten syllables , with the rhyming scheme // a b a b a b c c . Finding it so suitable for his facetious wit , he used it again in Don Juan , a meandering narrative interspersed with caustic and cynical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentiment and ribaldry . In this poem Byron most clearly reveals himself , flippant and sarcastic , brilliant and profligate . Byron was too subjective an artist to succeed as a dramatist . His historical play Sardanapalus ( 1821 ) and the two tragedies , Manfred ( 1817 ) and Cain ( 1821 ) are to be considered rather as dramatic poems than as stage-pieces . His heroes Manfred and Cain are but projections of himself , the proud , self-centred , tortured outcast in revolt against the tyranny of social order and authority , his mind aglow with the Promethean spark , and hurling defiance against the cruel destiny which compels mankind to face life and death with half-knowledge I feel the weight Of daily toil and constant thought ; I look Around a world where I seem nothing , with Thoughts which arise within me , as if they Could master all things . This is the figure of the Byronic hero , " dwelling in his despair , " which impressed itself so powerfully on the mind of Europe , and gave rise to many national schools of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a literary sense but by a will to challenge accepted principles in government , conduct , and religion . Byron 's masterpiece in satire is The Vision of Judgment in which he pilloried Southey , the Poet Laureate , and Farmer George , as the late King George III was known . His lyrical pieces , e.g. When We Two Parted , She Walks in Beauty , and Maid of Athens have a kind of prettiness , but it is clear that Byron 's genius did not lie in the direction of the lyric . Shelley While in Switzerland and in Italy Byron spent some time as a member of the Shelley circle . Shelley ( 1792-1822 ) , too , chose self-exile after a legal action which deprived him of the custody of his children , and he lived for the last four years of his life in Italy . His first important poem , Alastor , in blank verse , appeared in 1816 and ranked with the best that the romantic movement had yet produced . In it we can already discern the poet 's passion for humanity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healed of his " gloom and // misanthropy . " " A man to be greatly good , " he said , " must imagine intensely and comprehensively . . . The great instrument of moral good is the imagination ; and poetry administers to the effect by acting upon the cause " ( Defence of Poetry ) . Shelley believed in the perfectibility of man . He was thus truly in the tradition of Rousseau and the French Revolution . Yet he sought the salvation of the human soul , not through programmes and creeds , but through intellectual beauty , which he identifies with abstract love . His religion developed into a kind of pantheism based on the hypothesis of a pervading Spirit . Shelley 's philosophy , fully elaborated in Prometheus Unbound , envelops all he wrote with a kind of iridescent haze . The only poem belonging to Shelley 's youth in England which need be mentioned here , other than Alastor , is The Revolt of Islam , a romance in Spenserian stanzas , which is also a manifesto for revolutionaries . His greatest works were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cenci ; the lyrics , The Cloud , Ode on the West Wind and The Skylark ; the elegy on Keats , Adonais ; the political poem , The Masque of Anarchy , and the Platonist love-song Epipsychidion , which contains the essence of Shelley 's mature philosophy . Prometheus Unbound is possibly the greatest product of Shelley 's lyrical and philosophical genius . The myth which was the basis of the play by Aeschylus is here transformed into an allegory of man 's destiny , and in it we have the finest expression of the poet 's cosmic conception of nature . The Cenci written in the same year ( 1819 ) , is modelled rather on Shakespeare than on the Greek playwrights , and contains scenes reminiscent of parts of Macbeth and Othello . The story is Italian and the treatment is more realistic than in any other work by Shelley . The characters are of flesh and blood , and in Beatrice we have a figure of great dramatic force . The Cenci , even if it be difficult to act , is held by many to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything written in England for a century and a half previously . Adonais ( 1821 ) is an elegy modelled on Bion and Moschus who had also served Milton for his Lycidas . Bion , of the third century B.C. , was a pastoral poet of Sicily who wrote a lament for Adonis , and Moschus was his disciple . But Shelley is less classical in spirit . In place of the fauns and satyrs he uses spiritual presences and mourners And others came . . . . Desires and Adorations , Winged Persuasions and veiled Destinies , Splendours , and Glooms , and glimmering incarnations Of Hopes and Fears , and twilight Phantasies ; And Sorrow , with her family of Sighs , // And Pleasure , blind with tears , led by the gleam Of her own dying smile instead of eyes , Came in slow pomp ; ? the moving pomp might seem Like pageantry of mist on an autumnal stream . The phrase " pageantry of mist " will serve to describe the atmosphere of Shelley 's poetry ; and a stanza near the end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The One remains , the many change and pass ; Heaven 's light for ever shines , earth 's shadows fly ; Life , like a dome of many-coloured glass , Stains the white radiance of eternity , Until Death tramples it to fragments. ? Die , If thou would'st be with that which thou dost seek ! Follow where all is fled ! ? Rome 's azure sky , Flowers , ruins , statues , music , words , are weak The glory they transfuse with fitting truth to speak . Keats John Keats ( 1795-1821 ) was the third poet of this group , and he too represents a particular aspect of romanticism . He had a high sensitiveness to the sights and sounds of the world , and a quick intuition of beauty of form , colour and melody . " Keats , " said Matthew Arnold , " is abundantly and enchantingly sensuous . " He found in Spenser and in the Greek poets his principal models and sources : the former he admired for the external beauty of facrie , the latter for the beauty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his early poems and written in heroic couplets , is a story of a soul seeking to realize dreams of an ideal loveliness . The allegory is confused , since Keats , not content to keep his attention fixed on the nature-myth of Endymion and the Moon , introduces a bewildering gallery of mythological figures which have little connexion with the main narrative . The poet , it seems , could not resist the attraction of so much beauty . The poem , classical in theme , is Elizabethan in its richness of imagery . In Hyperion , published two years later , Keats makes a second attempt to " touch the beautiful mythology of Greece . " The story is based on the Greek sun-myth , and this time Keats abandons rhymed for blank verse , which he uses in close imitation of the Miltonic manner . The poem is epic in conception , but Keats abandoned it midway through the third book . " I have given up Hyperion , " he wrote , " there were too many Miltonic inversions in it ? Miltonic verse can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artist 's humour . I wish to give myself up to to // other sensations . English ought to be kept up . " Notwithstanding this , Byron matched the poem for sublimity with the poetry of Aeschylus , and Shelley said , " If the Hyperion be not grand poetry , none has been produced by our contemporaries . " The third of Keats ' great poems is The Eve of St. Agnes . In this his feeling for sensuous beauty and for the music of words has full play . He " loads every rift with ore . " We are compelled to think of Spenser , not only because of the use of the stanza of the Faerie Queene , but also because of the vivid apprehension of sights and sounds which fed his imagination 's yearning for the beautiful A casement high and triple-arch 'd there was , All garlanded with carven imag'ries Of fruits , and flowers , and bunches of knot-grass , And diamonded with panes of quaint device , Innumerable of stains and splendid dyes , As are the tiger-moth 's deep-damask 'd wings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , And twilight saints , and dim emblazonings , A shielded scutcheon blush 'd with blood of queens and kings . It is possible to consider the Keats of the Ode to a Nightingale and particularly of La Belle Dame sans Merci as the poet who came nearest , along with the Coleridge of Kubla Khan , to finding the perfect expression of romanticism ? the song that oft-times hath Charm 'd magic casements , opening on the foam Of perilous seas , in faery lands forlorn . In the Ode , Keats , yielding to his " drowsy numbness , " is approaching subliminal experience ; in La Belle Dame he is completely over the boundary which separates the waking from the dreaming state . Nevertheless , we accept the Knight-at-arms , the lady in the meads , the elfin grot and the pale kings as realities , and the incidents as being as circumstantial as any we have known in our actual experience . The poem , that is to say , answers the great test , in that it presents a world of the imagination to us in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hellenism A different facet of romanticism is presented by the Ode to a Grecian Urn . This was Hellenism , from which Gray and Collins , among the precursors of the romantics , had drawn inspiration in the // mid-eighteenth century . Early in the new century , the Greek spirit began to be a powerful cultural force . The Elgin Marbles had been brought to London . Ancient Greece was idealized as the cradle of political freedom The mountains look on Marathon ? And Marathon looks on the sea ; And musing there an hour alone , I dream 'd that Greece might still be free ; For standing on the Persians ' grave , I could not deem myself a slave . BYRON : Don Juan , Canto III But while it was the example of Athenian democracy which fed the revolutionary ardour of Byron ' and Shelley , it was Hellenism as the cradle of art and legend that attracted Keats . The Grecian Urn has the austere and stately beauty of Greek sculpture . Compared with the Ode to the Nightingale it is remarkable for the absence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of calm serenity O Attic shape ! Fair attitude ! with brede Of marble men and maidens overwrought With forest branches and the trodden weed ; Thou , silent form , dost tease us out of thought As cloth eternity : Cold Pastoral ! The impact of the Hellenic spirit on the romantic mind was thus to suggest the greater permanence of beauty based on truth , compared with that which arose from " breathing human passion . " A further typically Romantic notion was that the incomplete is better than the complete , and aspiration better than attainment For ever panting , and for ever young . It comes to expression again frequently in Browning 's work . CHAPTER XII POETRY IN THE VICTORIAN AGE THE passing of Keats , Shelley , and Byron in the early eighteentwenties was followed by a period of some fifteen or twenty years when the fine frenzy of the high romantics subsided , and a quieter mood ensued . The revolutionary fervour had abated . Wordsworth 's inspiration had deserted him and he had come down from the summits on to the flats . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writers of moderate talent , such as the peasant poet , John Clare , the writer of Poems descriptive of Rural Life and Scenery , and the factory poet , Ebenezer Elliott , famous for his Corn-Law Rhymes . The neo-hellenists , Thomas Love Peacock ( 1785-1866 ) and Walter Savage Landor ( 1775-1864 ) , were at work countering the exuberant fancies and loose texture of romantic poetry with the austerity and discipline of classical art . Others of note were John Keble ( 1792-1866 ) , the author of The Christian Year and the hymnologist of the Oxford Movement ; James Hogg ( 1770-1835 ) , the " Ettrick Shepherd , " who drew inspiration from Scott ; Thomas Hood ( 1799-1845 ) , known to-day by his Song of the Shirt and Bridge of Sighs , poems expressive of the " sorrow barricaded ever more Within the walls of cities . " The Changing Social Background Reference has been made elsewhere to the rapid growth of the reading public . It affected mainly the middle range of society , corresponding to that part which was enfranchised by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the political heritage of Britain , the middle classes aspired also to a share of the literary heritage . Poetry could no longer survive as an aristocratic prerogative . It had to learn to speak to a larger audience , and touch on the wider concerns of society . The conditions were favourable for a great outburst of literary activity . The idea of progress was in the air . Science and exploration were rapidly extending the horizons of knowledge ; an era of international peace was dawning ; the standards of living were rising , and it needed only the abolition of the Corn Laws in 1846 to set the nation fairly on the road of social amelioration . Although popular education 138 // was still backward , the " public schools " of the middle classes were rapidly gaining in importance , under the leadership of Dr. Arnold of Rugby . There was an increasing demand for periodical literature . The " quarterlies " gradually developed into " monthlies " and the " monthlies " into " weeklies . " The dissemination of literature was enormously helped by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All this meant that authors had no longer to depend on patronage for their livelihood . Financial rewards were not great , except for some exceptional writers such as Dickens and George Eliot , but on the whole they were dependable , and as the century wore on , the profession of " man of letters " attracted a growing number . As education spread , the demand for knowledge became an insatiable urge . Content in writing became more immediately important than form . The new public had little time to bestow on art for art 's sake ( a phrase in any case not yet invented ) , and clamoured for books which either set out the findings of the latest researches into history , biology , political science , geography , anthropology and the like , or applied them to the problems of the time , . The demand , in short , was for instruction and " improvement . " The attempt to comprise the utmost possible within the scope of the work led to a certain diffuseness in Victorian literature . In fiction , the characteristic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profusion is to be observed in all forms of Victorian art , from the ornament applied to household furniture to the Albert Memorial . John Ruskin may stand as an example of the encyclopaedic Victorian mind at work in literature . Didactic , discursive and opulent , he wrote on aesthetics , history , social ethics , literature , economics , religion , and education , all with a sincere passion for the spiritual regeneration of the nation . Herbert Spencer 's was another synthetic mind , ranging boldly over every department of knowledge as he reached out for comprehensive explanations . As the railways pushed their way into every corner of the land , the fixed patterns of social life tended to break down . Greater mobility brought more varied human contacts , and the diversification of experience could not but express itself in a vast expansion of the domain of literature . Victorian Romanticism Tennyson and Browning , both representative poets of the Victorian Age though standing in many respects as contrasts , matured during // the thirties . The publication of a volume of Poems in 1842 brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the death of his friend , Arthur Henry Hallam , who was the subject of his elegiac poem In Memoriam . This was published in 185o , the year in which Tennyson succeeded Wordsworth as Poet Laureate . Browning 's recognition by the public came about the same time , with the appearance of Dramatic Lyrics ( 1842 ) , although Paracelsus and Sordello had already been published . Elizabeth Barrett , at the time of her marriage to Browning ( 1846 ) , was already accepted as the foremost woman poet of the age , but her best work , including Sonnets from the Portuguese and Aurora Leigh , was yet to come . The eighteen-forties was therefore a period when a new impulse was given to romantic poetry . It was , however , romanticism with a difference . Tennyson recognized an affinity with Byron and Keats , Browning with Shelley , but romanticism no longer implied an attitude of revolt against conventional modes . It had itself become a convention . The revolutionary fervour which had inspired so much of the poetry of the first quarter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress , propagated by the writings of the Darwinians and the Benthamites . The tendency to seek material for the imagination in remote , shadowy fields persisted , but the pressure of the contemporary age was also strong , and the marvels of science offered no less promising a starting point for excursions into the regions of fancy . On the whole the period looked forwards rather than backwards . " The best is yet to be " was the dominant note of Browning , and Tennyson found spiritual consolation in contemplating the one far-off divine event . To which the whole creation moves , In Memoriam The earlier years of the Victorian age were thus marked by faith in the reality of progress . The questionings , although they may be found in Tennyson , were voiced more urgently by Matthew Arnold , the supreme poet of doubt , and these became the characteristic mode of expression during the later or so-called " decadent " period , the fin de siecle phase of disillusionment .
