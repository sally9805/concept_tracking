HARRY AND WALTER GO TO NEW YORK <P> Directed by MARK RYDELL Screenplay by JOHN BYRUM and ROBERT KAUFMAN <P> Movies like this are the price audiences have to pay for liking The Sting . Harry ( James Caan ) and Walter ( Elliott Gould ) are bumptious turn-of-the-century vaudevillians with more talent for stealing the customers ' wallets than for stealing the show . Offstage they drink out of the finger bowls at posh restaurants , swat each other with their hats a la Laurel and Hardy and cause everything they touch to blow up in their faces , from a bottle of champagne to a vial of nitroglycerin . " They 're not oafs , " someone says of them . " They would require practice to become oafs . " <P> Since they can not crack Broadway , Harry and Walter decide the next best thing would be to break into a bank vault . Having met a notorious gentleman thief ( Michael Caine ) during a prison stretch , they filch the plans for his next job and try to beat him to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Diane Keaton ) and her band of ragged reformers , who want to use the loot to set up a milk fund for New York City 's poor . <P> The real quest of both sets of thieves is for some spark of genuine humor amid all these outrageous contrivances . The screenplay is little help . It keeps turning up yokel lines like , " Paris - that 's near Europe and Asia . " Caan and Gould fall back on a series of frantic semaphores to the audience , calling attention to how adorably prankish they are being . Director Mark Rydell 's notion of how to give shape to a scene apparently is to make it louder and faster . This does produce an occasional laugh , just as somebody pounding a piano with a baseball bat is bound to produce an occasional musical tone . <P> But taken in its two-hour entirety , Harry and Walter is not very tedious . <P> It would require practice to become tedious .
