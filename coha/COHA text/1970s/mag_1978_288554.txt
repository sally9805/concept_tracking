TRANSATLANTIC BLUES by Wilfrid Sheed . Dutton ; 312 pages ; $9.95 <P> Americans have been grouped and groped , had their consciousnesses raised and their drawers lowered until it would seem there are no secrets left . There is one : the slippery , quietly gnawing matter of class . For those who have gone a long way on a knack and raw nerve , there are always night thoughts of doubt : " Are my credentials adequate ? " " Is my background acceptable ? " <P> This is an old story in England , where society 's lines , though wavering , are still anchored at both ends . Class-consciousness in the U.S. is considerably more baffling . Part of the reason is that Americans , particularly those of the college-educated middle class , are likely to see themselves in terms of popular psychological abstractions rather than as products of specific educational , religious and vocational realities . Psychology is , after all , more democratic : even an Ivy League Episcopal banker can have an Oedipus complex . <P> Television situation comedy does a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most modern American fiction , on the other hand , remains generally psychological . In contrast , British novels still draw their deepest breaths from society and manners . Wilfrid Sheed , a wily English-born Catholic intellectual , can work both sides of the North Atlantic . Sheed 's sharp , entertaining essays and reviews have earned him a reputation as one of America 's best literary journalists ; he is also a judge for the Book-of-the-Month Club . His previous novels , which include A Middle Class Education , Max Jamison and People Will Always Be Kind , have gained him entry into that literary purgatory where the praise is high but the royalties low . <P> Transatlantic Blues is about a different purgatory : that clammy conscience-ridden cell between worldly success and a proud otherworldly tradition . Stylistically , the novel is the nonstop confession of Monty ( n Pendrid ) Chatworth , a British-born American TV interviewer . He is something of an Anglo-American Alexander Portnoy , but with a crucial difference . Portnoy , draped over a psychiatrist 's couch , complained that his lust was repugnant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repugnant to his sexual nature . Chatworth , slumped in his seat high above the Atlantic , confesses to his tape recorder ( " Father Sony " ) that his English sense of proportion and Catholic asceticism are at loggerheads with his outlandish success . Chatworth vacillates between such statements as " Conquer America-God what a shoddy ambition , " and , like David Frost contemplating a bust of Emmy , " This is the country I want to impress , not the other one , and its approval is now pouring out of the slot like gold . " <P> A 747 is Chatworth 's sanatorium ( " For the busy man who does n't have time for a midlife crisis " ) , where he can indulge himself as " a born-again atheist , " a man torn between two continents , who should be buried in the Azores under a cruciform credit card . He sees himself as a fraud , " TV 's Amazing Thinking Man who speaks in little bite-sized paragraphs ... cursed with a special sound , which disappears in a twinkling if he listens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
