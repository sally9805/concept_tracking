THE MUGGING by MORTON HUNT 488 pages . Atheneum. $10 . <P> Breathing hard , a shabby old man climbed two flights to his flat in a Bronx slum . As he turned the key , he heard behind him a sudden pummel of racing feet . When he began to shout , somebody struck him powerfully five times in the left side with a knife , and as he fell to the floor of his kitchen , a flesh-colored hearing aid popped out of his ear and landed close to his face . <P> The end of Alexander Helmer is the beginning of this remarkable study of crime and punishment in the U.S. , 1964-72 . The book has been minutely researched , gravely considered and artfully composed for maximum popular effect . To typify an era of ghetto violence , Author Morton Hunt ( The Affair ) aptly takes as his central instance the commonest of ghetto crimes , an actual attack performed by a gang of teenage drug addicts on Oct. 9 , 1964 . <P> Helmer 's body was not discovered for nine days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informer fingers four young Puerto Ricans , three of them drug addicts and the fourth a juvenile sex offender . Later , the two detectives assigned to the case earnestly insist that the boys were merely " questioned . " The boys just as earnestly insist that they were punched , kicked in the groin and stifled with ammonia-soaked rags . <P> Whatever happened , one night of it persuaded Alfredo Ortiz , 18 , and Carlos Ortiz , 17 , to sign confessions . Doel Valencia , 19 , repudiated his statement in the morning . The actual killing , the confessions said , was done by Angel Walker . But Angel , a one-armed ex-boxer , was too smart to talk . A grand jury found insufficient evidence to indict him . The others spent five months in jail before their day in court . Author <P> Hunt describes the trial as a morose circus . The prosecutor is a plodding Percheron pitted against a couple of clownish counsels for the defense . One of them addresses the jury : " I leave the with you , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its aspects every part of the statements , and the beatings , and the lack of will , and lack of intellect-do you think that these boys , lacking practically any education ( that 's another item to be considered by you ) -I say that the resistance here was overcome by force ! " <P> Carnival of Lies . The jury is a careful selection of incompetents and the testimony a carnival of lies . The accused lie . The police lie . Even the prosecutor lies indirectly by concealing vital evidence that favors the defendants . After two days of wrangling , the jury fails to reach a verdict . A year passes , twelve more expensive months in jail , and the defendants come to trial again . The new lawyers are a bit better , but the new judge is a lot worse . The jury sets Valencia free but convicts the Ortiz brothers of " Murder One " ( first degree murder ) , a charge that carries a mandatory life sentence in New York State . <P> Miscarriage of justice ? Not necessarily , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the scales of justice , he comes strongly to the defense of the U.S. legal system . " The worst thing about our system , " he concludes , " is its dreadful inefficiency . " The best thing ? The idea that it is " better to let ten guilty men go free than to convict one innocent man . "
