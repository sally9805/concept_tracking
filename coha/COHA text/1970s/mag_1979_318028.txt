A cooler Ronald Reagan formally enters the race <P> For months he had waited patiently in the wings , as nine other Republicans entered the race without dislodging him from his position at the head of the pack . Last week Ronald Reagan , the once fervent evangelist of the political right , finally made his move . He did so in one of the nation 's few citadels of G.O.P. moderation : New York City . As a spotlight redolent of Hollywood memories illuminated his pinkish cheeks and slightly graying temples , the still handsome candidate declared , " I am here tonight to announce my intention to seek the Republican nomination for President of the United States . " Some 1,500 followers , who had paid $500 each to be present in the grand ballroom of the New York Hilton , stood and roared their approval . <P> They were then treated to 25 minutes of the sort of anti-Washington , pro-free-enterprise punch lines that Reagan has used to wow audiences since 1964 , when he campaigned for Barry Goldwater . But Reagan delivered his speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This time he is the front runner , and in an attempt to broaden his appeal , the former California Governor seems to have banked the fires that once frightened more moderate G.O.P. factions . <P> Yet , as befitted an ex-sportscaster and exactor , his delivery was as smooth and flawless as ever . Only when he told movingly of how his father had lost his job at Christmas time during the Great Depression did Reagan let his emotions show , nearly choking up . Vowed Reagan : " I can not and will not stand by while inflation and joblessness destroy the dignity of our people . " His voice also wavered at the same point in an identical TV speech broadcast that evening by about 90 stations , at a cost of some $400,000 . <P> If some of the excitement was gone as Reagan sought to sound more calm and reasonable , he had cause to believe that the political climate had moved his way . Certainly within his party , the ideological gulf has narrowed since 1976 . His three major opponents , Howard Baker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conservative as Reagan . <P> Reagan assailed " the arrogance of a federal establishment which accepts no blame for our condition , can not be relied upon to give us a fair estimate of our situation and utterly refuses to live within its means . " He labeled the nation 's economy a " disaster " and blamed it on a Federal Government that " has overspent , overestimated and overregulated . " He lamented the fact that " the great productivity of our industry is now surpassed by virtually all the major nations that compete with us for world markets . " He complained that " our defense strength has deteriorated . " He blasted U.S. failure to reduce its dependence on foreign oil .
