I HAVE JUST BEEN TALKING to a rare I specimen : a rich newspaper reporter . He did n't make his fortune on a reporter 's salary , of course . He made it by outsmarting Wall Street . He is confident that anybody else can do the same ; and on condition that T do n't use his real name , he has given me permission to publish his recipe . If you want to get rich quick , this formula will be of no use to you . Neither will it make you big rich , like an arms manufacturer or Texas oilman ; for that , you have to tap the public purse in one way or another , such as a Pentagon contract with a dreamy cost overrun or a depletion allowance . But if you are content , as my friend was , to build up a modest fortune gradually over a period of twenty or thirty years , the recipe ought to work . I 'm thinking of trying it myself . My friend , whom I 'll call Jay P. Morgan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he was working as a political reporter for the Washington Post . At that time Washington was swarming with eminent characters from Wall Street , piteously testifying before Congressional committees that Franklin D. Roosevelt was destroying both them and the country . Loudest among them was Wendell Willkie , spokesman for the power industry and later a notably unsuccessful candidate for President . He warned everybody within earshot that socialistic schemes such as the Tennessee Valley Authority and rural electrification were about to wipe out the private power companies . After watching Willkie and his fellow financial geniuses in action , Jay reached some conclusions about Wall Street . It was politically unsophisticated ; it was highly emotional ; it took short views ; and it seemed to believe its own propaganda . For example , every time Willkie made one of his impassioned speeches , the stock of most power companies ? particularly those in or near the TVA country ? would drop a few more points . Now Jay could not bring himself to believe that the New Deal schemes were all that dreadful . " On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if TVA actually did succeed in reviving one of the poorest regions in the country , and if rural electrification made it possible for millions of farmers to use electric lights and iceboxes for the first time , then the private power companies might benefit too . Eventually they would find themselves with a lot of new customers , including the industries TVA was bringing into the South . " So I took what little savings I had , mortgaged our home , and put every penny into Commonwealth &; Southern stock . Willkie had talked it right down into the cellar , and for a few years it stayed there . But by 1940 the Tennessee Valley was booming , the TVA generators could n't begin to take care of the new demand for electricity , and the private companies thereabouts were selling every kilowatt they could turn out . When I finally sold my Commonwealth &; Southern stock , it had more than doubled in price . " As you know , " Jay continued , " it is an old maxim on Wall Street that the small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to watch the odd-lot traders ? the little people who buy and sell in lots of less than one hundred shares . When they are buying in large numbers , the Wall Street sharpies consider that a signal to sell . And when the odd-lot investors finally get panicky and dump their stocks , then Wall Street figures that the market probably has hit bottom and will soon swing up . " I decided to sail on just the opposite tack . T would watch the Wall Street traders , particularly when they seemed to be in an emotional tizzy over some political development , and I would p contrary to whatever they did . For e : ample , when Truman got elected , to surprise of practically everybody , W a Street was stunned . It had confident . expected that its boy , Tom Dewe would be in the White House instead 4 that Missouri hick . Immediately aft ( the election the market plunged dowi ward in a spasm of disappointment . " During the years while Truman We in the Senate , I had gotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no fool , ar I also knew that he came out of ti Populist tradition and that he had het deeply scarred by the Depression . So felt pretty sure that he was n't going let the country slide into another d pression if he could possibly help it . I the week following his election , I w ; able to pick up a number of blue-eh : storks at prices which were sheer ceny . That , as you will remember , We the beginning of one of the fattest be markets of our time . " On the other hand , when Eisei hower was elected I figured he probate . would do just what George Humphrt and time other hard-nosed financie who surrounded him would advise . Na urally they were hell on inflation , at determined to restore the tradition disciplines to the economy . When th ( slammed on the brakes , the mark skidded ? and I was ready to take a , vantage of the turn . Likewise wit Nixon . Wall Street was so euphoric ovi his election that I decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a few glamot stocks that were then priced at a ridic lous forty times earnings ? althot4 short selling generally is against rr principles : too dangerous . In this case however , I did pretty well when th , glamour issues hit the toboggan las spring . " Jay concedes that in counter-guess ing Wall Street on political matters h , has the advantage of a lifetime of ex perience in Washington , working fo the Post , the Associated Press , and fo a while one of the newsmagazines . Bu he insists that any reasonably carefu political observer could do the sam , thing , whether he lived in Spearfish South Dakota , or Maud , Texas . Maybi even better , since an observation post it Middle America would be insulates from the gusts of political hysteria which often sweep Washington . Wha he is worrying about just now is th ( possibility that Wall Street may become more politically sophisticated . Alreadi most of the younger brokers , fund man agers , and security analysts not onh. understand post.Keynesian economic : but approve of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ en never were ? to a considerable degree o. government management of the econ omy , so long as it is done competently i.e. , in their interest . If this sort o. thing keeps spreading , Jay is n't sun that his strategy will work any longer LIE IS REASONABLY CONFIDENT , how I lever , that he can continue to out guess the Street on other scores . To this end , he has assiduously cultivated at anti-speculative temperament . Unlikt the quick-buck traders and the man agers of go-go funds , he is satisfied i he can make a modest profit over t period of years rather than days , and ht never permits himself to get enthusi astir over the speculative fad-of-the month . " At one time or another , " he said , " have watched the market fall in love with electronic stocks , gold-mining companies , textbook publishers , data processing specialists , oil companie : with some Alaska acreage , and con glomerates . Right now the favorites o the harem seem to he manufacturers o anti-pollution equipment . In each case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then has fallen just as fas when the glamour wore off . Thos. , traders who got in at the beginning o the affair , and then got out while pas sion was at its peak , presumably mad , a lot of money . But I do n't kid mysel that I am that smart , or that lucky . Be sides I 'm in no position to work full time at studying the market , and could never match the research facili ties of the big brokerage houses and mutual funds . " Consequently I shun the glamour issues as carefully as I avoid drunks in the National Press Club bar . Instead , when Wall Street starts chasing a new inamorata . I look around for some Plain Jane stock that has been neglected . For instance , a utility company in a rapidly growing section of the country , or a medium-sized bank . Their price will never double within the year ; but they are n't likely to go down much either , even in hard times . And they have a cozy habit of increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then . Within a decade you might be surprised to see how much your money has grown . But to find this kind of happiness , you need the temperament for a placid marriage , rather than for quick tumbles in the speculative hay . " I also avoid losses by not investing in things I do n't understand . Because I am mystified by computer software companies , I know I will never he able to tell a good one from a bad one . So I stay away from them all . Likewise , I am baffled by conglomerates . Stockbrokers told me that when a meatpacker , with borrowed money , buys a sporting-goods firm and a drug manufacturer , the resulting corporation ? known on the Street as Meat Balls . Golf Balls , and Goof Balls . Inc. ? was supposed to he worth a lot more than all three companies were originally . I could never get it through my head why this should be so . I also do n't understand how anybody could be competent to manage such a mixed bag of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with such tricky securities as convertible debentures , I ca n't help remembering those famous holding companies of the Thirties which floated bonds based on nothing but the common stock of their underlying companies . From the way conglomerate securities collapsed early this year , I gather that lots of other investors are beginning to share my doubts . " L IKEMANY PEOPLE who grew up dur- ing the Great Depression , Jay is inclined to he more cautious than the Wall Street whizz kids who have never known anything but a rising market , Consequently he is leery of industries which depend on the shifting whims of public taste : cosmetics , dress manufac ? turers , films , magazines , advertising agencies , and the like . He feels more comfortable when he is dealing with something solid , such as land or metal . " Shortly after the end of the Korean war , " he said , " I was assigned to write a series of articles about the government 's stockpiling program . While doing my homework , I became convinced that certain metals were in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get scarcer and scarcer as the underdeveloped countries began to industrialize . Examples are nickel , molybdenum , manganese , copper , silver , and mercury : and I could name a few others Their known ore bodies are being steadily used up , and in view of the intensity of exploration during the last fifty years , it is n't likely that huge new deposits will be discovered very often . It is true that their prices may fluctuate sharply from year to year ? but over the long haul , I do n't see how they can go anywhere but up . And a company which owns large reserves of minerals in the ground has something of permanent value ? in contrast , say , to a Hollywood movie producer , whose future is as chancy as his next spectacular . " Obviously when I am looking at mining companies , I want nothing to do with two kinds . One of them includes all those firms operating in politically unstable countries , since their properties are likely to be confiscated at any time ? as the Anaconda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , any mining firm which is heavily dependent on production in Latin America or Africa probably is a poor bet , though Mexico might be regarded as an exception . The other category to be shunned includes all those little , new companies ? particularly those traded on the Canadian exchanges ? which have no assets except a prospector 's report and an undeveloped claim somewhere in the tundra Now and then one of these claims actually turns out to be as rich as the prospector said it was but most such companies seem designed to mine American suckers rather than real ore bodies . Anybody who buys their stock is a gambler . not an investor . " HORTLY AFTER WORLD WAR II Jay Ofelt prosperous enough to buy a country place outside of Washington where he and his family could go for weekends and vacations . After scouting around for a few weeks , he located a worn-out tobacco farm on Chesapeake Bay which had been abandoned for years . Because it was then hard to *01 reach , over some forty miles of backcountry roads , lie got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarded this as a luxury , rather than an investment ; but when a federal highway made that part of the country more accessible , he noticed that land prices started to climb . Moreover , a lot of other Washingtonians began to look for country places , partly because their incomes and leisure time were increasing fairly steadily throughout the Fifties and Sixties , partly because Washington itself was becoming such an unpleasant place to live in . With its traffic congestion and rising crime rate , it had turned into a good place to get away from at every opportunity . Since Jay 's family really did n't need 120 acres , he began to sell off parcels of his shore-front property ? and was astonished at the prices he could get . Nobody , on the other hand , was much interested in his acreage which was out of sight of water . These observations led him to a highly profitable conclusion : nearly everybody who can afford it would like to own a bit of waterfront land . If population and income levels continue to grow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a property ; but the amount of such land available is strictly limited . " This looked to me , " Jay said , " like a classic monopoly situation if I could figure out the right way to take advantage of it . Chesapeake Bay acreage already had climbed beyond my reach . so I got a big map and began to look at lakes and rivers . It was n't too hard to spot a few of them that fitted the specifications I had drawn up . I wanted bodies of water that were reasonably close to Washington or the other big population centers along the Eastern Seaboard , that had not yet been developed as resurts or second-home sites because they are bard to reach . but that are sure to become more accessible as the federal interstate-highway program is completed . In addition , of course , they had to be clean enough to swim in , and surrounded with an attractive landscape . " This last requirement was the hardest to meet , but after six months or so of weekend driving through the Appalachian countryside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of river that seemed to fill the bill . No , I wo n't tell you where they are . You can do your own research . But I will say that northeastern Pennsylvania and some of the unspoiled parts of West Virginia are good places to start looking . " My best find was a little lake in cutover timber country where the forest is just now making a good comeback . Hardly anybody ever goes there except a few fishermen , so I was able to buy more than half of the waterfront acreage at a stumpage price from the lumber company which originally owned it . In three years , when the highways are finished , it will be within four hours ' driving time of one-third of the nation 's population ? from Cleveland and Pittsburgh to the west and New York and southern New England to the east . By that time , some resort developer ought to take it off my hands at a nice profit . " Only two things are wrong with this sort of investment . Until you sell the property , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to pay an annual land tax . And , although I enjoy driving through scenic countryside , I really do n't have the time to hunt around indefinitely for just the right kind of lakeshore acreage . " Recently . therefore , I have been looking for land companies , rather than for land itself . Wall Street , and most of the corporations themaelves , do n't yet think of them as land companies . They still think they are in the lumbering business , or mining , or cattle raising . But one of these days they are going to wake up to the fact that they own a lot of handsome land , containing relatively unspoiled lakes and rivers ? and that they can make more money by developing these sites for vacationers and for people who want an escape place or a retirement home by a brook in the woods . As our cities become more uninhabitable , the demand for such places is going to soar , and so will their prices . Already solitude , privacy , and a sightly landscape are becoming the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Jay said . " I have never tried to play the stock market . What I play is long-term trends ? in population , in politics . and In fundamental hinnan needs for certain scarce commodities . Your typical Wall Street trader does not have either the patience or temperament for that kind of operation , so I have been able to take advantage of certain small opportunities which did n't interest the professional speculators . I know that my system never make me a titan of finance ? whiclwould bore me anyway ? hut it does pro duce a useful supplement to a news paperman 's salary . And . I might as wel confess it , when I can outguess thus ( city slickers in New York , it does rri ) ego a lot of good . "
