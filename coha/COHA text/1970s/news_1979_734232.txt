txt WASHINGTON API  --  One of the Carter administration 's chief inflation fighters , Barry Bosworth , says mandatory wage and price controls could be " a potential option " next year if inflation gets out of hand . Even though his statement was highly qualified , it was the first time that a high-ranking administration official suggested publicly that controls could be an option . Meanwhile , Labor Secretary Ray Marshall said Monday the administration would not abandon enforcement of its anti-inflation guidelines until told to specifically by a federal court . A U.S. District Court judge last week ruled illegal the administration 's enforcement of its " voluntary " wage-price guidelines by threatening to deny federal contracts to violators . But the judge stayed an order forbidding such actions until Wednesday so the government could appeal the decision . A GOVERNMENT request for a hearing on the case during the week of June 18 is pending before the U.S. Court of Appeals , which presumably would continue to . stay the lower court ordered until it issues a ruling . " The assumption that we make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contracts until we get a definitive court . order saying we do not have , " Marshall said . He said the anti-inflation program " is still in effect and we will continue to enforce it as we always have . " MARSHALL SAID that if a guideline violation arose , the administration probably would not try to deny any federal contracts if a court ruling were imminent . But he said the administration might use such penalties if a clear ruling was not expected for a long time , like a year , if the case reached the Supreme Court . In ? earlier statements , President Carter said he would resort to mandatory controls only if there were a national emergency , such as an outbreak of war . Other officials , including Bosworth , also have repeatedly declared their opposition to mandatory controls . A spokesman for the Council on Wage // Carter aide hints inflation controls // and Price Stability , of which Bosworth is director , said Monday that Bosworth had not changed his opposition to controls .

The spokesman for the Council on Wage and Price Stability said Bosworth was not discussing administration policy during the interview , adding that his remarks were made in the context of " an academic discussion . " In the interview , which was lengthy and covered a wide range of subjects , Bosworth said " wage and price controls in the past have been effective for short periods of time to prevent an explosion of industrial wages and industrial prices . " YOU CAN MAKE them work for a period of time , " he said . " That is a problem that 's coming for the next year , " he added , apparently referring to a possible burst in industrial wages and prices .

The administration does not now have authority to impose mandatory controls .
