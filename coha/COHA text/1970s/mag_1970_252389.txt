From the moment French President Georges Pompidou stepped onto the White House lawn , everyone looked downward , not in deference to protocol , but to see what length skirt his wife was wearing . For the rest of the week , even in politically oriented Washington , much of the conversation about the state visit centered on Mme. Pompidou 's hemlines ( she changed as often as four times a day ) , most of which came to within six inches of the ground . <P> Mme. Pompidou arrived at a crucial time for the U.S. fashion world , which is in the midst of a battle over hemline height for 1970 . Her attire delighted U.S. manufacturers , designers and women 's publications already committed to following the French Longuette look , which was emphasized at the Paris show in January . It dismayed strong-willed women and Seventh Avenue manufacturers still loyal to the miniskirt . For what better advertisement for the midi or Le Long Look than France 's long first lady ? <P> Claude Cahour Pompidou stands 5 ft. 9 in. and is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is trim , athletic , looks attractive in bathing suits and superb in high fashion outfits . Normally devoted to pantsuits from Courreges , she switches to Chanel for day clothes and to Dior , Saint Laurent , Cardin and Laroche for ball gowns . <P> Leggy Look . Opulent as such a wardrobe sounds , Mme. Pompidou can not be accused of extravagance . France 's designers are delighted to have the press-agentry their first lady provides by simply strolling within range of photographers . The clothes are on loan , and Madame walks in glory , ogled by the public , photographed by the press and spreading the expensive news of the famous Paris fashion houses wherever she goes . <P> In America right now that news is not being well received by a male public still enchanted with the leggy look . Even Presidential Adviser Henry Kissinger dutifully professed his approval of Le Long Look but stressed his preference for miniskirts because " my office is in the basement and all I ever get to see around here is legs . " Women 's Wear Daily , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * jokingly called the new look " the damned length " -a reference to Luchino Visconti 's successful movie The Damned , which displays not only Brownshirts in drag but women in 1930s skirts . The influential daily has , as a result of its campaign , become a prime target of the miniforces . " Women 's Wear influences Seventh Avenue because it comes out every day , " complains one disgruntled manufacturer . " It 's like brainwashing : you read anything on a daily basis and you begin to believe it . " Others are hoping against hope that Orbach 's , which holds its trend-setting showing of Paris copies in mid-March , will try to hold out for shorter lengths . <P> Added Mystery . One designer who refuses to be pushed to damned lengths is Rudi Gernreich : " I 'm very much against the midi because it 's illogical . It 's like going to Mme. Tussaud 's . " Says Bill Blass , " I 'm bored with fashion dictatorship . Women are not going to wear something just because it 's publicized . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
