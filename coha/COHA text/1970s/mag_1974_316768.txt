Wherever Brooklyn Congressman Hugh Carey , 55 , campaigned in the New York gubernatorial race , he was pursued by strains of Happy Days Are Here Again - by a high school brass band , a black drum and bugle corps , a glockenspiel ensemble dressed up as Indians . Aside from the catchy tune and schmaltzy sentiment , the ditty had a further point : it was once Franklin Roosevelt 's campaign song . After 16 years of Republican rule in the state , a Democratic candidate was finally putting back together the old Roosevelt coalition of labor , liberals and minorities . So successful was his political surgery that Carey enjoyed a triumphant 3-to-2 victory over his hapless G.O.P. opponent , Governor Malcolm Wilson , 60 . <P> Carey had all the attributes of a winning New York candidate . Brooklyn-born and bred , he had the genial but " do n't tread on me " demeanor of the neighborhood Irish bartender . A Roman Catholic widower with a dozen children , he was at home with the city 's ethnic denizens who ask , above all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time , he was acceptable to the city 's liberals , the imperial custodians of party affairs . Though he served Brooklyn 's most conservative district , he maintained a relatively liberal voting record . Besides , after more defeats than they cared to remember , the liberals were hungry for a winner . <P> In the primary campaign , Carey was induced to lose 30 pounds , and his antiboss , neighborhood , pragmatic image was stressed as part of a $2.5 million campaign financed in part by his multimillionaire brother Edward , the president of New England Petroleum Corp . <P> Wilson never managed to emerge from the dominating shadow of Nelson Rockefeller , whom he had served for 15 years as Lieutenant Governor . Carey was careful not to give Wilson an issue ; he came on as tough as his conservative opponent on crime , inflation and big spending , though somehow leaving the impression of a more generous spirit . While Wilson bogged down in circumlocutions , Carey reached dizzying heights of oratorical excess . After one rendition of Happy Days , he told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but if you want to hear the harmony of this team being in symphonic rapture ... " He broke off to laugh at his own hyperbole . <P> There is talk of putting Carey on the 1976 national ticket , but he may be too much of a New Yorker to appeal to a wider electorate-his voice a bit too gravelly , his approach a mite too street wise . However , simply by recapturing the nation 's second most populous state from the G.O.P. , he has become a powerful figure in Democratic national politics .
