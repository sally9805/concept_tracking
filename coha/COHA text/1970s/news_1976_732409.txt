txt A divided Supreme Court cut back today on the broad protection that the Court , on First Amendment grounds , has given the press against libel suits brought by so-called " public figures . " The Court did this by applying the designation of " public figure , " in a case involving Time magazine , in a way that appears to exclude types of persons who formerly would have been assumed to be public people . Under Court rulings , public figures are required to make a much stronger case against the puhtisher of alleged libel than are nonpublic figures . By limiting the application of the " public figure " category the Court thus makes it easier to bring libel cases . The Court ruled , in the Time case , that a Florida socialite who was often mentioned in society reports in the press , whose divorce proceedings were widely reported , and who herself gave news conferences during those proceedings could not be considered a " public figure " for the purpose of de- ciding libel claims arising from her divorce proceedings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Time Inc. from a $100,000 libel award won by the woman , Mary Alice Firestone , on the basis of Time 's alleged mislreporting of the divorce decree entered at her husband 's request at the close of the divorce proceedings . Basically , the Court reasoned that Mrs. Firestone had no major role in " the affairs of society , " and that she had not willingly thrust herself " to the forefront " of a public controversy in an effort to influence its outcome . In the divorce case , Russell A. Firestone Jr. , a millionaire member of the tire family , was ' granted the divorce . There was dispute over the grounds on which the divorce was granted , and in today 's opinion , the majority found that Time 's assessment of the matter was inaccurate . Time Denies Inaccuracy Time had contended , among other things , that . Mrs. Firestone was a public figure , as that term has been developed by the Court in a series of libel cases over the last decade . The magazine said that she should thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Court cases have required of public figures ? proof of " actual malice " ? that the publisher had printed the information either knowing it was false or with " reckless disregard " of whether or not it was false . Since Mrs. Firestone had not submitted this proof , the magazine contended , the libel award should be set aside . Time made a series of other arguments as well : That the alleged misreporting was not actually inaccurate ; that the policies underlying the public figure doctine require that the " actual malice " standard in those cases should also be the standard of proof required in libel suits based in press reporting of any public judicial proceeding ; and that the award was invalid because the Florida courts had not established " fault " by Time , a factor that must be established in libel suits against the press . The court rejected all of the arguments except the last . It thus sent the case back to the Florida Supreme Court , which had affirmed the $100 , - 000 award and from whose opinions Time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As a practical matter , the ruling is not necessarily a defeat for Time on the specific question of the $100,000 award , because of the ruling on the fault question . The vote on the case was 5 to 3 , and two of the Justices in the majority , Lewis F. Powell Jr . and Potter Stewart , issued a separate opinion to explain their view that there was " substantial evidence " supporting Time 's position on the issue of fault . Also , while a spokesman for Time Inc. declined today to discuss the subject of libel insurance , most . publications do have such insurance . However , the opinion seemed clearly to be a restrictive reading of the First Amendment and thus something of a defeat not just for Time but for the rest of the press as well . While the vote was 5 to 3 , the various opinions show that of the eight Justices who participated only two actually took the pro-First Amendment positions argued by Time Inc . Those justices , William J. Brennan Jr . and Thurgood Marshall , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The third Justice who dissented , Byron R. White , contended that the Florida court 's decision sustaining the libel award should simply have been affirmed , and that no additional determination regarding fault was necessary . Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote the majority opinion , 1 joined by Chief Justice Warren ' E. Burger , and Justices Stewart , i Powell and Harry A. Blackmun . Justices Powell and Stewart are generally considered to be somewhere in the middle range of the court , ideologically . Justice John Paul Stevens did not participate . Some observers considered today 's ruling to bode poorly for the press groups who are seeking in the pending case to have the Court forbid gag orders . Beyond that , today 's ruling appeared to show that what one lawyer termed the " pendulum " of the Court 's rulings on libel and the First Amendment was continuing to swing away from positions supported by the press , after a period in which it had clearly been swinging toward them . Essentially , the cases making up these pendulum swings represent the Court 's effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , arrtee of freedom of the press , and the interests on the other hand of assuring citizens a way to redress unfair damage to their reputations . Underlying the effort is an awareness of certain realities ? on the side of the press , that the mechanics of the news business with its deadlines means that at least some inaccuracies are inevitable in reporting and , on the side of the individual , the fact that an inaccurate press report about a person with no ready access to the press can seriously damage an individual 's life . The Court 's effort at balancing these factors began in 1964 with a landmark case involving The New York Times , in which the Court said that public officials may not recover damages based on libel unless they show " actual malice " by the publisher . In subsequent cases , the Court extended this rule to public figures . And in 1971 , the Court appeared to extend it to private figures as well in situations where the subject of the press reports was a matter of public interest .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
