txt The meeting Sept. 19 between Rhodesian Prime Minister Ian Smith and U.S. Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger is not the great breakthrough it first may appear to be . According to a high U.S. official the talks are not an automatic indication there will be black-majority rule in Rhodesia . They may instead be merely a cog in what look more and more like stopgap measures to forestall the outbreak of a race war in southern Africa . A big question is : Did Dr. Kissinger agree to talk to Mr. Smith to provide a face-saving cover for South Africa over Namibia ( South-West Africa ) ? The UN is pushing for independence for that territory , which South Africa administers in Epite of UN resolutions . By arranging the Smith-Kissinger talks , South African Prime Minister John Vorster 's image as an international diplomat is brushed up at home . He may be able to turn around and , without much opposition , agree to an international conference on Namibia that would include leaders of the independence movement SWAPO ( South-West African People 's Organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talks with Mr. Smith do not produce substantial give on the part of Rhodesian whites , the black leaders may reject Dr. Kissinger 's negotiations . - Certainly the Namibian issues seemed headed toward art international conference . That is , Mr. Vorster would have minimal difficulty selling the conference idea to his supporters . SWAPO leaders have wanted to talk to Mr. Vorster for a long time to negotiate Namibia 's independence . But unless Mr. Smith has agreed to give on majority rule to some extent , blacks in the four front-line states of Zambia , Tanzania , Mozambique , and Botswana may be very bitter . If for example , Mr. Smith agreed only to discuss the reported guarantee plan of $1.8 million to ensure the security of whites in a black Rhodesia , that could be inadequate . To keep the negotiations going , Dr. Kissinger must be able By Albert J. Forbes , staff artist to return to black Africa with something concrete . He must be able to answer whether he has been able to gain genuine movement toward transferring power from Rhodesia 's 270,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observers of Africa are worried that the Rhodesian Prime Minister , who time after time has outfoxed other diplomats with promises , has done it once again to Dr. Kissinger . // rom page 1 * Smith-Kissinger talks no breakthrough The fact is the United States has given up its big bargaining chip . It has agreed to talks between the Secretary of State and Mr. Smith ? which the latter has been seeking for a long time ? without any prhir concession on Mr. Smith 's part . Now only South Africa can put real pressure on the intransigent Smith government , and Mr. Vorster has indicated his unwillingness to do that . Majority rule may be a clause in the Rhodesian Constitution but the recent congress of the Rhodesian Front Party in Umtali , Rhodesia . did not make the liberal moves considered necessary to facilitate a transfer to eventual black power . - The problem on the black side is the splintered nature of black Rhodesian leadership . Joshua Nkomo , head of the internal African National Congress , may be the man behind whom the front-line states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not proved he has the majority of black Rhodesians behind him . The military branch in Mozambique has not thrown its backing to any of the politicians . Generally speaking , the black nations do not want the Cubans to become involved in Rhodesia as they did in Angola shortly ' before its independence . But even if Cubans stay out . the fighting could drag on and on . Although Dr. Kissinger talked with opposition leaders within South Africa Sept . IS. he did not spend any time talking about South Africa 's race problems to Prime Ministe'r sten Yet South Africa ; with its policy of apartheid ( legal separation of the races ) . is the heart of the crisis in southern Africa . But right now Dr. Kissinger is moving around the edges . lie plans to meet again with Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda and with SWAPO leader Sam Nujoma in Lusaka . probably Sept. 20 and to go on to Tanzania to report to President Julius Nverere . At stake as far as the United States is concerned is the possibility of further Soviet involvement in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ southern tip of the continent , as well as the threat that the minerals ( gold , chrome . uranium ) could be taken away from Western markets . High U.S. officials do not expect a solid agreement on Rhodesia on this trip . Apparently the hope'is just to keep some kind of negotiations going .
