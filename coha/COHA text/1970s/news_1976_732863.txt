txt W. Michael Blumenthal , the Secretary of the Treasury-designate , hopes to win the backing of the business community for the economic programs of the Carter administration , partly by advocating policies that business approves ? and also by explaining to businessmen why the new administration may feel forced to do some things that many of them will not like . With this objective in mind , Mr. Blumenthal has - already begun telephoning businessmen and bankers to explain his views and to get theirs , and he expects to hold meetings with a wide crosssection of business executives in the next few weeks . Mr. Blumenthal , the chief executive of the Bendix Corporation , gave his views on a wide variety of subjects in an interview . Among the other highlights were the following : %le favors Government planning in the sense of setting goals but not a planned economy or such specific pieces of legislation as the Humphrey-Hawkins full-employinent bill . jHe thinks the economic condition of the underdeveloped countries is one of // the major issues facing the United States , and he expects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the present Administration 's , but that are also pragmatic . qHe has never personally Invested in a tax shelter ( although he does own taxexempt bonds ) , but he does not see the sense of the present law , which sets a higher maximum tax rate on Income from investments than on income from wages or salaries . gile is not exactly sure how to momplish it , but he believes the tax system should make it neither more nor less advantageous for corporations to operate in foreign countries , rather than in the United States . This option is more advantageous for many multinational companies , though not all . As for the program that the Carter Administration will adopt to stimulate the economy , Mr. Blumenthal said he thought there was a considerably greater divergence of opinion within the business community than was expressed by the 15 business executives who met with President-elect . Carter at Blair House a week ago . On that occasion , Reginald Jones , chairman of the General Electric Company , proposed a $23 billion tax-cut and job-creation package , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wants to . Consult More But Mr. Blumenthal ' said he felt the need to explore , with " a wider cross-section of the business community , " their feelings about tax reduction and spending increases and about the total size of any package for an economic stimulus . What is being discussed in Carter circles has ranged from $15 billion to $20 billion , in tax reduction and job-creating spending programs combined . A package of this size , as has been pointed out by Bert Lance , the director-designate of the Office of Management and Budget , would mean a budget deficit of $75 billion or more . Mr. Blumenthal said he planned to explain to business executives his own impression of the facts , which is that without any Government stimulus to the economy , the unemployment rate could go up to 10 percent or more and there could be new riots in the cities . He expressed the belief that a consensus could be built in support of whatever economic stimulus program Mr. Carter finally adopts , partly by just such an explanation of the facts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " put together a set of policies that take into account the views and needs of as many different sectors as possible . " He noted , for example , ti at some people had advocated a tax cut that would go almost exclusively to the low-income bracket . But , he said , that would not be the best answer because " it is necessary to build confidence in the business community by doing some of the things they want . " ' Compromise Package ' The building of such confidence , he said , would " translate itself into investment decisions and other business decisions " that in themselves would be beneficial to the economy . He did not , specifically mention tax changes that would snake investments in new equipment more profitable , but this appeared to be what he meant . Other key aides to Mr. Carter have also endorsed such investment incentives . In Mr. Blumeritha ? s view , it is necessary that the program to stimulate the economy be " a compromise package that has something , in it for more than one group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argument that it all ought to go to one poup . " He begged off discussing longer-range tax policy questions in detail on the ground that he was no tax expert . He mentioned simplification of the tax laws and making them fairer as two desirable goals , while stating that he did not know now how to achieve either one . " ut he elaborated somewhat on his third objective in the tax area : . dealing with the question of how progressive tax rates can be before " they create disincentives to work . " " I do n't know what the right rate is , " said . But he added , " I do n't quite understand the philosophical basis " for setting a top tax rate of 50 percent on " earned " income from salaries , professional fees and commissions , and a rate =f 70 percent on " unearned " dividends I interest . He said he had never Invested in tax shelters because " I really felt badly about tying to reduce my tax bill to the Government when I was earning a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " it was my sus ) icion that most of those tax shelters were really just a way to transfer money from Uncle Sam to some promotion . " As for the economic problems of underdeveloped countries , Mr. Blumenthal said t he thought what he would encounter would be analogous to what he faced when he came into Government service first time , in 1961 . Then , he said , ? Government had long taken " a doctrinaire position " that such things as international commodity agreements to stabilize prices were wrong because they interfered with free market forces . Now , he said , as in 1961 , he believes " sympathy will replace the doctrinaire ' nyet . ' Specifically , he endorsed negotiations looking toward the creation of an international fund , generally called a " common fund , " to help stabilize some commodity vices , a position that is directly at variance with the one taken by the present Secretary of the Treasury , William E. Simon .                 @ @ @ @
