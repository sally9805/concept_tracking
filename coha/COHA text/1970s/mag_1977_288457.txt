The realist-revolutionary in a Paris retrospective <P> Any artist who feels mashed by critics can take comfort in what used to be written about Gustave Courbet . Consider the broadside he got from Alexandre Dumas fils in 1871 : " Under what gardener 's bell , with the help of what manure , as a result of what mixture of wine , beer , corrosive mucus and flatulent edema can have grown this sonorous and hairy pumpkin , this aesthetic belly , this imbecilic and impotent incarnation of the Self ? " <P> Dumas was not alone in his fury . The French political journals , center and right , ravaged Courbet for years , and beside their vilifications the attacks on impressionism and cubism were mere Ping Pong . Such vehemence only rises from the conviction that art changes life : that painting has a public role . <P> One contemporary critic described Courbet 's work as " an engine of revolution . " Courbet agreed . He thought of himself as a subversive force : the epitome of the avantgarde , a one-man realist movement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painting is the only true one .

" Pipe , Assyrian beard , clogs and beer gut : all his life he projected an image of invincible roughness and solidity . In fact , his greatest paintings were rarely the work of a simple realist . For example , The Meeting , 1854 , showing Courbet 's encounter with his patron Alfred Bruyas and a manservant on the road near Montpellier , was based on a woodcut of two bourgeois meeting the Wandering Jew ; but its poses ( oddly ritualized for a " realist " work ) may carry an esoteric reference to Masonry . Nevertheless , Courbet seemed a monster of high animal spirits , rooting like a boar for sustenance in the gray rocks of his native Ornans-a man of the people ( in reality , the son of a well-off landowner ) who never lost his country accent to the Paris salons .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
