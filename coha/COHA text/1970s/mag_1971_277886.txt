The vitreous humor , the substance that fills two-thirds of the eyeball , is vital to vision . The clear , jelly-like material transmits light while maintaining the pressure that helps hold the retina in place . Hemorrhaging , which occurs often in severe diabetes , can cloud the vitreous and impair vision , and loss of its gel-like consistency can result in detachment of the retina . Both conditions can produce blindness . <P> Doctors now replace lost or damaged vitreous with either natural material taken from donors , saline solutions , air , silicone or other synthetics . None of those materials is completely satisfactory . The synthetics sometimes trigger toxic reactions that lead to further eye damage , the air is soon absorbed , and transplanted human vitreous may provide only short-term benefits . Now a research team at Cornell University Medical College 's Rogosin Laboratories has developed a material that overcomes all these problems . According to Dr. Michael W. Dunn , he and his colleagues are using collagen , a natural body substance , to replace lost or damaged vitreous humor . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protein that helps to fill the spaces between cells of the body , collagen is already used experimentally to replace skin destroyed by burns . Extracted from animal tissue and further purified , the collagen gel is injected into the damaged eye by hypodermic . Once in place , it acts as both a light-transmitting substance and a source of pressure , filling the eye and holding the retina in place . <P> Experimentation with the collagen gel has been encouraging . In tests undertaken recently , no subject rejected the purified collagen as a foreign substance . Nor does the collagen liquefy . Instead , it is gradually absorbed as new ocular fluid appears naturally , usually within four weeks . Meanwhile , the gel promotes the return of vision . On one series of patients treated by Dr. Donald M. Shafer , the collagen gel was administered as part of a regular surgical procedure to seven people with eye hemorrhages . In three cases , there was a recurrence of the hemorrhaging , and the damage was too severe to be corrected . But four patients who had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the point where she was once again able to read .
