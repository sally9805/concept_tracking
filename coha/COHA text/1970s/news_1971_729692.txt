txt An " epidemic " of flat feet that had built up to prescriptions for 17,000 pairs of orthopedic shoes a month here , paid for under Medicaid , has been halted by the City Health Department . The " epidemic " had spread . after welfare recipients , cut off from special allowances for clothing and shoes , turned to Medicaid . By obtaining podiatrists ' prescriptions , individuals who needed only ordinary shoes were able to obtain more expensive orthopedic shoes paid for by Medicaid , which also covered the podiatrists ' consulting fees . The interruption of this practice in the last three or four months  --  with the number of prescriptions reduced to 2,000 to 3,000 a month  --  means a potential saving of about $3.5-1million yearly , First Deputy Health Commissioner Lowell E. Bellin said yesterday . In another development , Investigation Commissioner Robert K. Ruskin said that the city was holding up Medicaid payments to certain carriers for transporting disabled patients while his department studied frauds involving possibly million of dollars in transportation billings over the last four years . Dr. Bellin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 40 podiatrists ? about 5 per cent of the podiatrists participating in Medicaid . The program , operated with city , state and Federal money , pays medical bills for 1.2 million welfare recipients and 200,000 other needy people . In a move to stop soaring welfare ' costs , the state , late in 1968 , ordered a flat-grant system for all the needs of welfare recipients except rent and fuel . This eliminated special allowances that had been available on verified applications for such items as clothing and shoes . Within a year , Dr. Bellin said , the City Health Department , which monitors the services given under Medicare , began finding a surprising buildup in Medicaid bills for orthopedic shoes . A staff member posed as a welfare recipient , Dr. Bellin said , and attended sessions of a welfare rights group where he heard announcements , " If // you want shoes , see Dr. Soand-So . " Dr. Bellin said the diagnoses given with the prescriptions were " pes planus , " for " flat feet , " on which he asserted there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The cost , he said , averaged $20 a pair from shoe dealers plus initial and checkup fees for the podiatrist . The practice allowed individuals who simply needed any shoes , which they could no longer get through welfare aid , to get the special shoes paid for by Medicaid . By last Christmas the prescriptions had " plateaued ' ' to 17,000 pairs a month , meaning $340,000 for shoes alone or $4-million a year , Dr. Bellin said . Just before last summer , he said , he borrowed extra staff members from the Department of Social Services and informed podiatrists that they would have to get " prior authorization " from the Health Department for all Medicaid shoe prescriptions . Previously this had been required only for shoes costing over $40 . " Immediately , shoe requests dropped from 17,000 a month to 7,000 , " Dr. Bellin said . His department 's screening of the need for those left found , among other things , a diagnosis of " pea non hygienica " ? which he translated as " dirty feet " ? and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month . The deputy health commissioner said the indication was that " families looking around desperately for another way of taking care of a particular need " had been driven to a Medicaid abuse , so that the welfare economy effort had only been increasing other governmental costs . Meanwhile Investigation Commissioner Ruskin said his department 's look into Medicaid transportation activity involved checking the " authenticity and validity of vouchers " held by a factoring company . Factoring companies pay Medicaid practitioners up to 90 per cent of the sums owed them by the slow-paying city and then collect the full claim later from the city . Last year the executives of one factoring company were accused in a Bronx indictment of bilking the city of $2-million for false claims in a plot with six city employes . In the inquiry into the $3-million a-year Medicaid transportation service , Commissioner Ruskin said the identifications of companies that had billed for trips for treatment apparently never made would be withheld pending outcome of the investigation . Mr. Ruskin said the payments , made through the City Department of Social Services , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , will also check any possible collusion with carriers by employes of institutions with authority to refer patients , as well as study possible interlocking relation . ships among the transportation companies .
