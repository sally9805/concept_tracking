txt FACED WITH a dragon invasion , ' the world is vulnerable . The last 300 years have produced an alarming drop in dragons and in scholars knowledgeable about their behavior . The last serious scientific study , " The History of Serpents and Dragons , " was published , by Aldo Vrandl In 1010 . And possibly the only scholar in the Midwest who has read it is Michael J. Murrin , associate professor of ' English at the University of Chicago and dragon expert . " My specialty is actually the Northern European dragon , rather than the smaller Mediterranean variety . My friends at the Oriental - Institute say I know very little about the , Far Eastern variety , " Marin cautioned before granting an interview . " Do n't get him started on four-footed dragons ; stick with the two-footed ones , " warned a student of Murrin 's , paSsing by ' his ' office door where two bold posters of dragons hang . They are gifts from students , as are the various prints and dragon statuettes in his office on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " THE DRAGONS of the north are the fIre-breathing variety . There Is no indication that they eat . The dragon in BeoNI/Willies through the night breathing a great fire circle like a huge dive bomber . They are associated with tombs and ' treasure . While they ' do not eat , they do drink water . " Fafnir , for example , goes out once a day to drhtic water , ' Murrin said . Fafnir , Immortalized by Richard Wagner in the " Ring , of - the Niebeltmg , " is his fa- vorite dragon . " Fafnir is just called a worm , but he 's a pretty good ' one . The place from which he drinks is 60 feet high . On the other hand , a lot of them have wings , some have ' feet , and some have.all these accoutrements . " The Mediterranean dragon is the man : eater , or more properly maiden-eater . Typical of the breed Is the dragon slain by St. George . He breathes poison , and he probably has some ability to communicate with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although it 's difficult to understand how ho made such an elaborate arrangement with the city for a regular supply of maidens without indicating his wishes , " Murrin said . " Though larger and m ore horrific , the Northern European dragon is less of a social problem than the maiden-eating variety of the Mediterranean , " Murrin said . THE LAST reported sighting of a Northern European dragon occurred just before the Thirty Years War 1618-1640 , when a particularly large specimen was seen flying north over the Alps toward Spain , Murrin said . But the Vrandi book is evidence that dragons are still not considered extinct almost 30 years later . It was the age of reason that spelled doom for the dragon 's reputation , Murrin theorized , as it did for witchcraft , sorcery , and the other magical arts and beasts . " I 've always been interested in dragons , just as I 've always been interested in fantasy , " Murrin said . " I developed an elaborate discourse on dragons for the entertainment of my friends , relying heavily on J. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rings " and a literary scholar . Then , when I came here to the university , I was teaching ' The Faerie Queene , ' and I decided the students deserved one large , light lecture a term . Since there is a dragon in book one , that was it , and it has become a tradition . " IT HAS ALSO won hIm a tongue-Incheek listing in the university 's Faculty Source List between four biologists DNA and two literature professors Mramal under the heading . " Dragons . " " The modern dragon literature , like Anne McCaffrey 's books , is amusing , because it stresses stuff that 's not in the ancient sources . In ancient literature you never see more than one dragon . The idea of dragonettes and dragons mating is just not there ? for good reason . Dragons do n't have sex , so far as we know . Usually they arrive by metamorphosis . Fafnir was a giant before he became a dragon , " Murrin said . His first personal encounter with dragon literature occurred as a child when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who wrote the Oz books . He even drew maps of Oz , including a complete catalog of magic objects and where to find them in Oz . Those who have not read further than " The Wizard of Oz " may not be aware of the dragon in the series . He was stymied when a pail of boiling molasses was thrown in his mouth . He plunged his head in water , and the congealing molasses cemented his jaws together . Murrin suspects that that " dragon " was actually a sea serpent . " It is traditional that sea serpents , as opposed to dragons , are really dumb . Dragons are supposed to be wise , especially Northern dragons , " he said . FROM TIME to time , Murrill teaches a course in modern Fantasy at the university , drawing from Tolkien , German fairy tales , Kafka , science fiction , and the darker work of E. T. A. Hoffmann , a German writer best known for the story of the Nutcracker . Murrin first taught the course as a Ph . D. seminar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the seminar remarked , " The predominant air of unreality in these sessions almost has me believing these things . " " It 's not that they 're inherently prejudiced against fantasy , but they are so conditioned to the novel that they transfer its requirements to literature that is not meant to reflect reality at all . Fantasy is tried in the wrong court . My colleagues all grew up reading novels , and I have . to get across the worth of what I do . The novel is only 200 years old , and fantasy is , well , older than Beowulf , " he said . The undergraduates , however , take to the course like a Mediterranean dragon faced with a succulent maiden , making it the second most popular humanities course when it is offered . " AFTER THE atom bomb and the reign of the Nazis , the age of reason came to an end , and fiction must come to terms with a world where we can go to the moon and blow up the Earth . It has to be something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dublin , a particular social stratum , or the consciousness of a particular individual at a certain time , " Murrin said , effectively slaying the dragon protecting a treasure of contemporary novelists . Murrin 's armor consists of a double-breasted black.blazer , striped shirt , and maroon tie perhaps a token from his lady , the university . With his dark-framed glasses and shock of dark hair , he might appear to some as a young executive rather than a professor , much less a dragon expert . Murrin deplores the long tradition of minimizing the powers of dragons . " In literature dragons are huge monsters . In decoration they tend to be cute and funny , rather than frightening , and in painting they tend to be of the diminished variety . You ca n't fit a huge monster into a painting , so they are usually diminished to the very domestic size of a horse , " Murrin said . WHILE DRAGONS ordinarily wait for a knight to seek them out for a battle , Murrin offers expert advice for anyone coming on a dragon unawares : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alarmed . " They are the personification of weather and are beneficent rather than a source of anxiety , " Murrin said . Only the Northern European , Mediterranean , and Middle Eastern dragons are dangerous . The Middle Eastern dragon , like the dragon of the Apocalypse in the Book of Revelations , can only be killed by an angel . There is no other defense . But the other two , varieties have two vulnerable spots . An arrow or sword through the throat or underbelly is sufficient . Only one knight failed to survive after using the underbelly method . The dragon rolled over and squashed him , Murrin said . Killing the dragon should be a last resort only . " You may kill a dragon , but that usually is your own death warrant , " Murrin said . " George died in the Christian persecution under Diocletian . Beowulf died in the battle itself . If you kill a dragon , you yourself will pay . "                   @ @
