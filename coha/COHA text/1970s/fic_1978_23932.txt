A story by Annie Dillard OMETIME IN THE MIDDLE of a September night in 1905 , in the town of Port Hammersley on Northern Puget Sound on the north coast of Washington State , a man called Clare lay asleep with his wife in their bed . He was a thin man thirty-one years old . He slept like a baby . / He slept facing the window , facing west toward the water ; his wife slept on her belly between him and the window . His sleep was a great falling , a free and con- , . pk= fident drop into nowhere . The man 's mind was wholly absent . It was not dreaming , but purely nowhere , purely sleeping . While he slept his body fell continuously , coincident with itself , on the mattress beside the wife in the upstairs bedroom of the house on Lambert Street . At some time during that night , at some time before he woke for the day , some time before the sun itself rose but after its light had appeared , while he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes ' lids rose ; the man 's head lifted an inch from the pillow ; his eyes moved together for a minute or two , as though pointing at the nest of wife 's hair on the mattress , the paling west wall of the room , the rooftops visible from the window , and beyond them the sea 's tide swelling with light under the brightening sky . The man 's two eyes moved in the direction of these several objects , but they moved reflexively and alone , as though the man were dead . He slept . The eyes ' lids dropped ; the skull rested ; the eyes moved together under their lids for a few more minutes , then rolled upward and were still ; the man slept on . Annie Dillard is the author of Holy The Firm ( Harper &; Row ) . HE SHEEPSKILL RIVER is born of a drip in a cirque at the tongue of a glacier hung on a western slope of the Cascade Range . The drip freezes into an icicle which hangs into a small pool ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the cirque and through the mountains , adding seep to melt and swelling so fast that a mile from its source a man requires one-piece rubber waders and a stout stick to cross it . This is the Sheepskill River . It ducks into the forest , chutes between foothills , and falls asleep on the Sheepskill plain . The plain spreads from the hills to Puget Sound ; it spreads smoothly , without shadow , because the river has rolled over and over in its sleep , or dreamily swished its heavy tail , and flattened everywhere the land . When settlers first came . they found the Sheepskill silt under the cedar-fir forest ; it made a decent loam lightened by sand , and they cleared the woods to farm it . The settlers logged the timber and grazed cattle around the stumps . They found the Puget Sound winters so mild that cattle needed little hay and chickens needed little heat . They ran dairy herds and raised laying hens and planted peas on the plain ; in the summer and fall they fished the salmon runs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from barges north of Sheepskill flats . In this way the town of Port Hammersley had grown up in the 1800s and continued to grow . The settlers built the town by the water , just on the dry side of Sheepskill flats and north of False Bay . They named it a port optimistically , hoping the river could bear the timber down to the water , to the Strait of Juan de Fuca , and tugs could drag the logs in booms or its products in barges to some other fine town , and everyone would prosper . But the port aspect failed ; there was no sheltered harbor , and the shifting , silty channels around the flats could not support a boat with more than six feet of draft . Still , the wharf was good for fishing boats in season , and small tugs ran the channels when the tide was right and bore away the river 's logs in booms . Port Hammersley had been a pioneer settlement living from hand to mouth until the railroad came . The railroad came by accident when in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Port Hammersley after a conflict over the contract in the rival town led to a shooting scandal . By 1903 the railroad had laid track north from Seattle almost to Port Hammersley , seventy miles of rail along the shoreline bluffs . Progress slowed , just south of town at False Bay , where engineers ordered a trestle . False Bay was a vast and useless mudflat that cut three miles into the coastline south of town . On the highest tides a deceptive three feet of water covered its mud , so that from the water it appeared to be a deep and sheltered harbor . Ignorant strangers were tempted to run their boats into False Bay ; they either departed at once when they heard their anchors hit . or they ran aground three miles from shore , or their boats heeled over stranded when the tide ran out , and their hulls soon broke up or stuck . There was often a wrecked hulk awash at the mouth of False Bay ; the railroad crews incorporated one of them , a smashed dory , into the causeway fill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trestle : for four miles it vault-ed over the water in a wide , slow curve which ended in the town 's south side . When the crews finished the trestle , the railroad built a depot and an en-gine shop . A salmon cannery moved in and transformed four streets of south-side pleasure houses into boardinghouses for Chinese labor- , ers . A chickenpacking plant appeared and many shake and shingle mills sprang up . By 1905 more than 9,000 people lived in Port Hammersley ; the town was a town . All engravings in this section are from Harper 's Monthly Magazine Part One EAL OBENCHAIN stood in the False Bay mud , bounced on his boot toes , stepped aside , and watched the mud-salt water fill his boot-toe dents . The tide was coming in , but it was a neap tide that -7 would barely moisten the deep , yz triangular , and wholly unnaviga " ble bay . False Bay 's only use was to townspeople who scratched in- ferior clams from the mudflats --  horse clams , bent-nose and jack clams  --  and to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tides . It was the children who , the previous summer , had found the body of a Chinese who had jumped from the trestle . Things dropped from the trestle tended to wash up in Old Bay ; so did lost crab pots , and broken boom logs on a westerly . There was an old shark carcass on the beach , which Obenchain had passed on his way to the open flats . The carcass represented a shark which had once been eighteen feet long ; the living thing had fouled in a Port Hammersley fisherman 's net and drowned . The fisherman , according to the story , had displayed the shark on the town wharf till the carcass exploded and stank ; then he towed it out to sea and cut it loose . But then he saw a strong flood tide drag it back shoreward and lodge it , disintegrating , against the wharf pilings . At last he enclosed what was left of it in his ruined net and towed it south to False Bay ; he beached his boat on the flood tide and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round stones under a sandstone cliff , the shark had solidified , barely bothered by shade-chilled flies . The sun and the freeze blackened and dried it ; rain ran down it ; the northerly wind turned it to stone . The fisherman 's net had rotted at once and his manila line became a ridge of shreds ; but the shark carcass under the cliff ceased changing . It looked like a creosoted log , or a lava tube , or a vein of coal , or a sewer pipe . It was a black nothing , neither animal nor mineral . It was one of many obstructions on the upper beach that a person had to crawl over or walk wetly around ; the others were all dead Douglas firs whose spiked trunks jutted out from the crumbled cliffside and pointed seaward like artillery . It was December . It was December all day and dark as the center of the earth . A solid cloud cover pressed over the land and the water like a granite slab . For three weeks , no one from the town hadseen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun had in fact appeared fuzzily on the far side of a fog ; but then the granite clouds had closed the sky again . This afternoon no one could see even the western islands . Walking on the mud below the beach , Obenchain could barely make out the trestle . It was four-thirty , after sunset . The colorless light , which came from nowhere , was dimming , and the blue dark , like a purse seine , was drawing close . Obenchain stood in the center of an ever-decreasing circle . He chewed a salty clamshell and spat the bits on the mud . He could still see , halfway out of the hay where the tide still ran , a dozen drenched cormorants , motionless in silhouette , riding a tide-held log ; but he could no longer see the raft of black brant sucking eelgrass under the trestle . He could see humped eelgrass in the mud by the water , and he could see black pools and channels of standing water everywhere splitting the flats where the shining darkness of the water carved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were gaudy patches of oil film visible at his feet . Whenever something died beneath the surface , its decay left a film of iridescent oils , blue and yellow , on the mud . Near one of these oil slicks Obenchain found a lady 's comb . " Comb , " he thought , and combed his hair . Everywhere he walked he could see big wormholes in the mud . There were bloodworms under there , bloodworms as fragile as egg yolks ; if you touched one while you were digging clams , it broke and spilled cold blood into the hole . And there were lugworms under there ; they always stretched and never broke . Sometimes Obenchain liked to break lugworms in two with his teeth . Now Obenchain woke from his thoughts and discovered that one of his pants ' legs was soaked ; he had stepped too near a horse clam 's hole and the clam had squirted a load of water on him . He quit the mud then and moved to the black eelgrass heaps where he walked on hidden skeleton shrimps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The flat stank of cold live mud , fish parts , and fog . He was a fat man , but he was getting cold . Beal Obenchain was tall . fat , and young  --  only twenty . He had come to False Bay to think . He had killed a man last week and had just decided not to kill another . He and a fisherman had killed a Hindoo by lashing him to a piling under the town wharf one night and leaving him to drown when the tide came in six hours later . They had knifed a purple starfish , which was in the way , and pried it from the piling in sections ; they stripped the Hindoo , who had , so far as they could make out , a particular dread of the big crabs that would roll in with the water ; Obenchain himself had become weepy , and recited a psalm from his childhood ; they gagged the man and bound his wrists and lashed him to the piling with a rolling hitch . As a final gesture , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they left a lighted lantern , so he could watch the water for the first three hours as it rose , until it washed the lantern out ; after that , he would have to imagine the water , until it touched his feet . They departed , and no one from the town saw anything . The least interesting aspects of the Hindoo 's death for Ohenchain were its possible consequences on the temporal plane . Obenchain often thought that he was not afraid of the town . He was an intellectual and the townspeople were laborers . They were laborers with pretensions , who never left the life of sensation but only refined its objects : when they had a little land , or a twenty-year-old name , they switched in their boots from beer to sherry and got them an Indian to cut their wood . Respectable people were those who avoided outcry and polished their boots . Obenchain was more than respectable ; he was a natural aristocrat , a demiurge even . He was a stranded mystic , an embodiment of pure mind ; above all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had access to the cosmological structures , a man of pure methods ; he knew secrets . Sometimes he wept , he wept ! when he remembered Jerusalem . And it was by the simplest , most worldly wisdom , too , that he knew that if the powers that be were to deny him their energies , he could always use his mastery of the powers that are . He knew , dimly , that if the sluggish laborers of the town should somehow stir against him , he was smart enough to keep the sheriff flattered by losing at chess  --  and if that failed he was loose enough to move . Obenchain had no ties on earth . He had rowed to Port Hammersley from one of the outer islands when he was twelve ; he rowed up and down the tides for two days and a night . He sold his boat to a childless couple he found in town who put him up while he went to school . He hated the couple ; he read in his room . When he was sixteen he built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woods south of False Bay . For four years now he had split shake bolts from cedar stumps for cash , paid no taxes , and cultivated the landowners as an audience and as a source of books and fruit pies . Bored , he invented games with dice and with cards ; he bet on bad weather ; he talked to himself : he made a spectacle of himself when the pass ager coach went by . He paid cash or shingles for recent translations of books from France . He liked ideas , purity , and little else . He had killed a man last week and had just decided not to kill another . Obenchain was young and thought he needed to walk in order to think , or in order to quiet his thoughts ; he had not yet noticed that in fact he thought best when he was talking . He had not thought well in False Bay , but he had not been wholly bored . His own actions often surprised him ; his feelings and deeds overtook him like seizures , like storms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Obenchain knew what he himself would do . The man he had decided not to kill was James Clare Fishburn , called Clare , who taught domestic arts in the high school shop , and whose name Obenchain had drawn that day from a bucket ; and the way in which he had decided not to kill him was by threatening to kill him and doing nothing , by letting him live as best he could with the knowledge that he was at any moment to die . You simply tell a man , any man , that you are going to kill him . Then  --  assuming that he believes you enough to watch his every step but not quite enough to run away or kill you first  --  then you make certain not to kill him and instead watch what he will do , Killing the Hindoo was less interesting than Obenchain had hoped it would be . When you kill a man directly , on no matter how gradual a tide , you do not , he learned , actually " take his life . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His " life force " is not added to yours ; it is over , and nobody gets it . You take as yours , bluntly , only his body , which is of no value or interest whatever save to hungry crabs and his wife . If , however , you make a man believe that you will actually arrange for his dying at any moment , then you can , in effect , own his life . For how could that man perform the least or the greatest act with his whole heart ? You would give him , like bondsmen , self-consciousness and uncertainty , and they would deliver him unto you . How could such a man eat a plate of food or lie with his wife or take two steps in a row without thinking the very thoughts you bade him think ? You would own this man without your lifting a finger . His every action and his every thought would be in some sense under your control . Life is mind , Obenchain thought , and mind in some marvelous way operates in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell a man his life is in your hands and , miraculously , his life is actually in your hands . You own him insofar as he believes you ; you own him ps God owns people , to the degree of their faith . And what , Beal wondered abstractly , would become of this man 's former life ? To what category of being belongs a dead life whose body lives on ? Obenchain had known Clare five years ago , in the high school shop ; at that time he had a pregnant wife . a dead-end job . a house on a bill , and a head full of nothing . Should someone hold a funeral for this dead life ? Clare 's body would live long after Clare 's own life was over . This was the very opposite of murder , Obenchain thought , it was anti-murder ; it was birth , or conception . And he thought  --  and sentimental tears rose in his eyes  --  that in many long years when the body called Clare should die of natural causes , he , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funeral apparently as a townsman , but in fact as the father of a dead only son . Obenchain could no longer make out the trestle , or the waterline , or the mud . He had no more reason to be in False Bay than he had to be anywhere else on earth except in his shack , where he could light a bucketful of folded papers in the stove , fire up some wet alder , and dry his pants . He would call on Clare Fishburn after dinner . Accordingly he recrossed the mudflat in a drenching blue ' dark and reached the cobble beach where stones ground loudly together underfoot . Feeling his way over the beach logs , the shark carcass , and the dripping sandstone cliffs , he gained at last the plain . The bay had held more light than the land ; the plain was black as a cave . Obenchain walked south , seeing nothing , and felt with his feet for the tracks . over Clare 's own shirtfront . Clare 's mother was clearing the table . The old woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; in a minute he would jump up to act it out : Then he would spill not only the pudding , but the child as well . Mabel slid lower on his lap . She was all but five years old  --  born on Christmas . She heard her father 's voice through a bright fog of sleepiness . On the back porch the door banged , and banged again : Grandmother was throwing salmon scraps to the dog , the clog who had been crying pitiably since sunset , as though it had not yet in the length of its life so much as seen a morsel of food , yet knew , with its dying breath , that there was such a thing , inexplicably denied to it of all creatures alone . Clare reached the critical point in his story . He stood up , propped Mabel on his chair , exited to the parlor , and entered the dining room again with bravura ; he waved his arms in a certain way  --  showing his stockings  --  and finished the story . Then he gathered up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoon . They were running late . Clare himself had begun the pudding long after dark . He had unwrapped the apples from their carton in the cellar and chopped them , red and white Kings , green and white Gravensteins , into a yellow bowl . He had shunted the wood stove 's heat into its oven , where eventually the salmon baked , split by its stuffing , and five brown potatoes baked , and the dark pudding frothed down the sides of the yellow bowl . Now it was after eleven , and Grandmother was cranky , and he and June were starting to stare , and Mabel was asleep . His must be a bony sort of lap , Clare thought , but Mabel had a way of softening to fit any occasion , as though she had no bones . The skin on her arms felt hot ; her hair gave off a scented steam as she slept . Clare scraped some hardened brown sugar and butter from the yellow bowl 's side ; he offered it to June , who smiled , and ate it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wished they had a piano . Tomorrow he would surprise June with a sewing machine . In the summer he would go to the mountains . They would have another baby , enclose the front porch , and things would settle down . June stacked the dessert plates and filled a basin with water she had set to heat on the stove before dinner . Grandmother carried the tea things to the table . Clare sat alone . He could see , reflected in the dark window across the table , the yellow gas lamp , floating and globular like a planet or star . Beneath it , and also floating over the outside dark , were reflections from the kitchen window behind him which contained again , golden , the gas lamp , and his wife 's round head in motion  --  and Mabel near and spread pale along the darkness , and a cluster of vaporous teacups on the table , and a bottle of milk . LARE CONSIDERED his real life to have begun six years ago , when he had come home to Port Hammersley , married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bought the Lambert Street house on a fourteen-year mortgage loan . Before then his life seemed to him formless and scattered , a series of stabs at a /5 , ) , c ' 1 , life . He had stumbled through jobs and towns and friends with great good cheer and little real hope . He had greeted everything with open arms that never closed around anything . It had not mattered what he did . Before he met June he was planning to quit the high school shop and go fishing . June had loved him for the same reasons others liked him : for his broadside and undiscriminating enthusiasm for all things equally , for a piece of music or a plate of corned beef , for snow or no snow , for whatever he was doing at any moment , for planing a plank or calling a dance or shaving his face . He looked like a boy burnt out from playing , haggard and sweet-faced , thin , quick to laugh and quick to forget . Her ease in the world matched his ; her glance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ details of which he had been eager to learn . He quailed before her fearsomely firm opinions about some things , and stepped forward to solve her childish perplexity about others . Her feet were so small she could n't keep his shoes on . She and his mother ? who treated all men like children and hated them for it  --  ran the house . Since he had married , Clare made no more changes . He had set his net and it held . Good things accumulated , and nothing slipped through . Things gathered and grew ; their life spread . When his senior retired . Clare would run the domestic arts program himself . In eight years he would own the house . They had added a front porch to the house , and a woodshed ; they had dug a garden , to which they added a new row every year . Chance had added to them an aggrieved terrier and a bobtail cat . His mother came . He planted a row of poplars . In the shop he fashioned cherry frames for watercolor prints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the kitchen . He refinished the chairs ; he made cider ; he painted the house blue . Every year at Christmas they added new friends to Christmas dinner and new ornaments to the tree . Every spring he vowed to quit the shop , and every summer he missed his students and searched for them on the streets . He ate smoked salmon all fall and blackberry jam all winter ; he made batches of beer in the spring and dug for clams in False Bay . Every summer he traveled farther down the road to cut stove-wood in the forest . Every month June reminded him to pay the mortgage . He had plans to build a skiff . He wanted to climb Mt . Baker , fish for steel-head , try his hand at woodcarving , and buy a little farm . Almost everything was his idea of a good time . It was a good feeling to have a drink , and a pleasure to have a family , and a joy to have it rain the day he said he 'd fix the roof . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He never answered letters . Once he walked fifteen miles to save a nickel on twenty pounds of potatoes . He never deliberately told a lie , but he never happened to keep a promise . He smoked in bed . He told people he hated schedules , planning , appointments , finances  --  anything fussy or detailed . He enjoyed enjoyment . He whistled in bed every morning and fell asleep every night after tea . He took his sweet time . He was late for work and late for supper and could no more remember to fetch home a sack of sugar than fly . His wife laughed at his jokes ; his mother waited on him ; and his daughter rode on his shoulders , bouncing her heels in his heart . HEN CLARE 'S caller came , June was finishing up in the kitchen , Grandmother was reading her Bible after seeing Mabel to bed , and Clare was drowsing alone at the table . He heard the bell and answered it . The fat boy , whom Clare recognized , filled the doorway ; he blinked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stood in it as if it had been a chicken yard . His eyes were blank , like eyes of clay . Clare had no idea what he would do . He offered him some tea . He regretted aloud that they had no sherry , but they did have tea and some pudding . As Clare spoke he shooed the cat from the parlor sofa and picked up a doll , a painted doll , which had been standing on a sofa cushion . Obenchain made no answer . Clare started to seat himself to put his guest at ease , but rose up again , uncertain . He had seen a revolver tucked in Obenchain 's pants . " What do you want ? " Obenchain told him . He said , looking down at Clare and then wildly at the tops of the parlor windows , that he was going to kill him , shortly , for his own reasons ; that Clam had not much longer to live ; and that he considered it a part of justice to share this knowledge with him . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . and arrogant ; he rarely looked at Clare . Both men were standing . Clare wondered if Obenchain always packed a revolver . He heard June climbing the hack stairs . He understood that Obenchain did not expect him to speak or to act in any way ; his role was to listen until the speech wore itself out . Ohenchain was saying something about " perfection , purity , and control . " He apostrophized the precision of Providence , the freedom of the elect , the uses of the privileges of ownership , and the intricate structure of the " realm of shades . " Glare tried to concentrate on what the man was saying ; he wanted to learn his place in these abstractions . But he could not follow them . He could see only that Obenchain believed himself . He was uttering a creed . Clare hoped to get him out of the house very carefully ? so he could think . Obenchain stopped talking ; he held himself in control . Was this the boy Clare knew from the high school , whose bladder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own life had been a force like a geyser or flood , too strong to contain ? He showed no malice now : he was examining Clare as if he were an unusual binding on a book . He smiled and confided , with a hint of baby talk in his voice , " I picked your name at random from a bucket . " Clare wondered what June would say . Would he tell her ? What would the sheriff say ? He had seen Obenchain and the sheriff together in taverns , playing chess . A weariness overcame him , and intolerance , and a wish to sleep by his wife in their bed . " You will excuse me now , " he said , " but I was just going upstairs . " And so Obenchain started to leave . He had never taken off his coat . He found the door and stepped out , speaking cordially , as if he had come to dinner . Clare closed the door . He turned back inside . He replaced Mabel 's doll on the sofa ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the kitchen stove ; he extinguished the parlor lamps , one by one . Then the bobtail cat cried at the door , and he opened it to let her out . Obenchain was still there . He was standing stock still in the vacant lot below the house , barely visible in silhouette against the distant water . He was looking toward the house . Clare did not know if Obenchain could see him at all ; the house was dark . " Go away ! " he called out ; " Go home ! Go away ! " Clare lay in bed under the tall , cold window . When June asked what Obenchain had said , he had answered that he 'd only wanted to use the old steam lathe at the shop . It was the first cold-blooded lie he ever told her . Now she was asleep . I am wide awake , Clare thought . He knew Obenchain had no reason to wish him dead . Obenchain liked reasons ; he had a bucketful of reasons for everything he did , which he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understood his own reasons , and Obenchain believed himself . He was unpredictable , he was perhaps drunk or having a spell of excitement , he was perhaps acting on someone else 's orders  --  hut , for all that , he was not kidding ; he was in earnest . Somehow Clare 's life had become important to Beal Obenchain . And so , even while he lay in bed that first night , Clare began the process of believing him . Who was he not to believe Ohenchain , when Obenchain believed himself ? People do what they believe they will do . If you believe you will plant marigolds , Clare thought , you will probably plant marigolds , and you will not if you do not . If a man believes that the concept of your death fits his plans , however obscure , then the concept of your death fits his plans , however obscure , 0 and he is the one with the gun . Clare could try to kill him first , or he could take his family and leave , or he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Obenchain had sounded as though he meant gat very night , or the next day , or the next . What about the sewing machine ? Grandmother knew where he had hidden it . What would Obenchain do ? When ? In the high school shop , Obenchain would do anything . He would shout suddenly , and address the class . He knew , he proclaimed that he knew , what men had forgotten : the relationship between time and eternity , in all its details . He had knowledge of purity . He knew what power turned the big saws ; he knew the limits of cold chisels , the ontology of hammers , the secrets of the numbers on the rule . Sometimes he would wander away , wild , when Clare was talking to him . Or he read books in a corner and licked his fingers , one by one . Clare saw him once in the hall standing still with his jaws open and his lips stretched down like the lips on a tragic mask . His pants were wet ; his eyes were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with tears . Obenchain mastered himself , Clare knew , more every year . His brilliance took on the force of coherence , the force of a large and balanced battery of ideas aimed at a single point . Most people were afraid of him . Some of the better wives in town took pity on him , and fed him pies in their kitchens ; their husbands contributed books . People said that he could read Greek . They said a tree had fallen on his head when he was a boy on the island , and one of its branches had broken into his skull and lodged in his brain . They said he was a genius who would make the town famous . They said he ate cloudherries , which are poisonous ; they said he ate soap ; they said he had a hand in tying the Hindoo under the wharf at low tide . People said all kinds of things . Mabel would be in good hands . What about the mortgage ? June , he wanted to think ; but a patch of colored fog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought again , and for a moment saw her stiff and blurred and bewildered . But what a fog there had been that morning ! Yes , it was very late now . He had been walking to school . There was sun overhead , glad sun moving the fog , and also a wet southeast wind which meant that rain would change the scene shortly . There was sun above the fog , and the air itself was colored . It moved in balls and lobes . He admired the blue fog ; it poured around the buildings ' corners . A bright mass of illuminated fog swelled in a garden ; he could see a rainbow dissolved in it . Batches of lighted yellow fog rose from the streets . People were pastel and porous . Everything was painted pale on moving screens . As Clare walked he noticed his bounding blue shadow , like the Spectre of the Brocken , loom on a lighted slab of fog at his side . Sometimes the shadow disappeared altogether ; it vanished into a siderift or canyon of clear air . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice effect , a pretty one . Light soaked the air . He walked in a great bowl heaped with pale blue and pale green globes , with pale red and yellow globes . Now , in the warm bedroom with his eyes closed , Clare moved in a dazzling fog . He watched the colored globes as they rose like released balloons and filled his skull . They melded and parted at random ; their hues massed and blurred . Now there was rhythm . Now everywhere in his head a light was drifting , a light senseless and beautiful , and there was no darkness anywhere . Part Two PRING CAME TO PUGET SOUND and to the plains and the moun-t tains . The earth rolled belly-up to the light and the light battered it . And Clare Fish-burn was still alive , was still walking abroad in the daylight 4k where everything changes , and k holding tight to the tiny nights as they rolled . t Spring came to the northern coast and the daylight widened . Daylight stuck a wedge into darkness and split it open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sky like a thing set loose . Clare never knew where to expect it . Mornings the sun seemed to appear from anywhere at random , like a swallow . It rolled up the sides of mountains and down the sides of mountains , range after range around the world 's east rim . Every afternoon it threw a new set of shadows and shine on the parlor wall ; every night it flew behind a different island . The sun is a creature who flits , Clare thought ; it is a bee . Winter was lost and irretrievable before Clare caught up with it . He had thought that seasons were longer ; he had thought that he was younger , and that lie had more time . Now things were unhinged and floating away ; he was not prepared for spring . How could he prepare ? People moved out of their houses more , and back in ; the ducks vanished from the water , the widgeon , and the pintails , and the green-winged teal ; the white sea ducks by the wharf changed into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or warm nights , and the days were hot orcold . He saw more sky and more motion . The northeaster blew , or the southeaster blew , or it blew from the west and Clare could smell the mudflats at low tide . Every time he looked out of town  --  across the plain or over the water  --  he saw some new batch of blown weather : some icy clouds that lowered at once and rained , or some piled clouds that sailed slowly and lay blue prints on the water like upwelling stains . " The harvest is past . " Clare thought . " the summer is ended , and we are not saved . " Every day was a day in which Clare expected to die . When he woke one Sunday morning in the third week of March he regarded his sleeping wife gravely . Her head lay lightly on the mattress and smoothly , flush , as a clam rests on its shell . There was a perfection and composure in her small face : her eyelids fitted over her eyes precisely ; her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her face was home to his eyes . He had looked at it so often , for so long , that he half believed it was his own face , as near to him as his own thoughts and feelings which he saw expressed in her moving skin and eyes . Now she was sleeping . A strong westerly wind rattled the window and meddled with the tops of trees outside . At breakfast Clare considered his mother . She was cheerful in the mornings , as though the day might offer her something . When had he seen her standing without a plate or a pot in her hand , or sitting without a lapful of mending or unshelled peas ? She was old now , shrinking perceptibly. and her skin was softening for death . His mother believed , Clare thought , that people left here for somewhere else . She would be happy to leave plates . Always she had been greater than all her tasks . She had , for instance , a private love of works of divine and historical prophecy , and a knowledge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she could not bake into a pie . She studied her Bible and books alone in her room . Splitting theological hairs was her specialty , and arguing Scriptures her joy , yet he had known her to do it only once in all his life . She was strong , too , and able . She could split a piece of cedar with a tenpenny nail . It was a trick everyone had seen . Now she carried dishes back and forth , being of some use , and thinking God knows what . Her dark skirt was shiny at the seat ; her hair hung white in a single thin plait ; her skull was starting to show , yellow , through her forehead . He could not remember how she looked when she was young . He had not done right by her , and now there was nothing he could do . Perhaps there never had been ? He could have let her talk to him more . He could invite Reverend Labue to dinner so she could batter him with Scriptures . But should he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Amos , interested in old battles and dead kings ? Would that have been right ? Now he would die first ; he would go and prepare a place for her , if there were places to be had . If there were tables to be had , he would set a table for her , and bid her sit and eat . But there were no tables , and no plates , and nothing to eat . It was hard to imagine a place without any sort of plates . He looked at his own plate . He had eaten his breakfast and was not dead yet . A month ago he had decided not to think any further about being poisoned at home . Obenchain had talked about killing Clare very specifically , as though pinpointing him alone from among all the crowds of the living demanded a precision that attracted him . He would not want to risk killing someone else in the family by mistake . Or would he ? Would he take them all by some neighbor 's doctored pie ? Or poison their water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poison there was no end . He would not think of it . Everything tasted good . Now June caught his eye ; she was smiling and wondering at him . He touched her , covering her hand with his , but she rose just then and slipped away to the kitchen . Was he too sentimental for her ? He carried his plate to the sink , following her , uncertain , and lay his hand over the small of her back . He told her he had watched her sleeping that morning . She turned to him , confused , and took his plate . He saw that she was embarrassed . People do not want to hear these things . There was a wagging patch of light on the wall above the sink ; the bushes outside the dining room wagged too . The planet wagged on ; the man who planted those bushes was dead . And time , for Clare , had sprung a leak . For he was on his way , it seemed ; he was a man already exited . To these people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a secure round space , a bubble in which one rode protected from one end of things to the other . June wiped the last of the dishes and hung her apron by the stove . Grandmother fetched a tray from the pantry and headed out back toward the cellar . Mabel sat on the kitchen floor in the peculiar way she liked to sit , with her back straight and her legs pointing every which way , as though they were broken , or dislocated at the hips . She was scratching the cat with a fork . The cat cringed and made no move to leave . Clare could see the dark at the edge of the plain . He felt a hole in the wall behind him ; things rushed out of that hole . He was running out of air . Yesterday he had imagined and seen the long horizon of water and plain begin to tilt and upend ; on the low side a gap appeared , and water and houses and all the world 's contents slid into the gap and blew away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a freak accident , a mistake . Clare no longer felt any flat and bounded horizon circling round him at a distance . Every place was a tilting edge . " And I will wipe Jerusalem as a man wipeth a dish , wiping it , and turning it upside down . " Time was a hook in his mouth . It was reeling him in jaw-first ; it was reeling him in , headlong and breathless , to a shore he had n't known was there . Something crashed . Clare woke in the kitchen to see Mabel fly out of the pantry crying . She had dropped something . She had stopped scratching the cat , he realized , and had just been helping the women ; they were restocking the pantry from the cellar stores . They had all been carrying armloads. of jars past him ; had he been in their way ? And Mabel had dropped a loaded tray of plum preserves . Every glass jar had broken on the pantry floor . Now she had run away . This precocious and self-sure little Mabel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too hard to help anyone clean up her mess . The women passed Clare and crowded into the panti-y with brooms and dustpans . Clare found Mabel crying on the parlor sofa . She was five years old , too old and too big to pick up . Cl are picked her up . He picked her up and bore her from station to station around the parlor , around and around , absurdly pointing her face toward each window in turn , as though she were an infant still and might see some bright sight over his shoulder that would catch all her attention . But she cried wetly on his neck . Was the world not her place , either ? She kept slipping inside her dress ; he hoisted her up again . How had he got to he thirty-one ? Wh at had he done with his years , what had he meant to do , and to what should he devote his days ? ' Had he meant to do anything ? He had been arranging things and putting things to rights , so that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Obenchain told Clare he was going to kill him . During that time  --  during January , and February , and most of March  --  Clare had watched his own increasing detachment . He had begun to see his own Lambert Street  --  its well-loved fresh frame houses , its lilac bushes and tended apple trees  --  changed before his eyes into an abstraction , to an accident , to a certain street in a certain town . Port Hammersley was a town among millions of towns , the town in which most of his life had elapsed  --  and his time was a time among times . This bright year , this 1906 with its shifting winds and great , specific clouds , this raw-edged spring when the puddles dried and the green-winged swallows reaped the new fly-hatches in the air  --  this was one year . He had begun to wonder where , in this series of accidents , the accidental part ended . Was he to June only a man among many men ? Or , worse , was she only one of many women he might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some other street , in some town he had never heard of , with some other woman  --  a woman he did not know ? It was a terrible thought . He did not like strange women . Sometime in January he had seen a magazine photograph of uncovered skeletons . An Indian man and woman , " a Brave and his Squaw , " the article said , had been unearthed by a farmer 's plow in upstate New York , where they had lain " embracingin death " for an unknown number of years . Clare saw two human heads and some bones stuck in clay . The skulls looked , like all human skulls , identical , phrenological , medical , and like no one he had ever met . They were skulls like all skulls . They had no noses , no skin or hair or tongues , and there was clay in their eyes . Those people were as flat as scars on a clay pot ; they were a layer between soils thinner than groundwater . Their clavicle bones and ribs lay on the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the skeletons scattered ; the people seemed to have lost interest . The couple had only one hipbone between them , no spine , and no legs or feet save a few sunken bones ringing them at random , as though something like moving water had stirred their grave . There was clay in their ears , clay in their eyes , clay in their mouths . They did not Iook unearthed . They looked earthed . No wonder you 're cold , he thought . There was a story he and June knew about two drunken Irishmen . The first drunken Irishman wandered into a cemetery one night ; he tripped on a heap of dirt and fell into a freshly dug grave . From the bottom of the grave he moaned , " I 'm so cold , I 'm so cold . " Another drunken Irishman , also at large in the cemetery , stumbled to the edge of the grave and peered in . He heard , " I 'm so cold , I 'm so cold ! " " No wonder you 're cold , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off . " When Mabel was an infant in her cradle June had replaced her covers many times a day , and many times advised her , No wonder you 're cold ; you kicked your dirt off . The Brave and his Squaw had kicked their dirt off , had kicked their flesh off , and frozen to death . Clare had held the magazine open on his knees and looked at the photograph a long time . What did this dying mean about the two who had lived ? Were they man and wife ? Had they known they were going to die ? Had they seen themselves as they really were , as temporary partners on some swift passage , like strangers who band to ford a stream together , or to cross a mountain pass , who part and scatter ? Were all marriages then made in the shadow of death , and were they as such mere marriages of convenience ? Was his to June ? Surely those Indians had not seen their union as made in heaven and continued there . Probably they had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have done ? - What Clare really wanted to know was this : Would he ever see June again ? The question embarrassed him . It was a question connected in his mind with religion , with his mother 's Bible and the church he had known as a boy . He knew that fifty years ago in the West they used to say , " Ai n't no law west of St. Louis , and no God west of Fort Smith . " But now God had been in the West for two generations ; God , and women , and railroad trains . He knew that citizens in all the Western towns and cities had welcomed the churches for their civilizing influence and their fine architecture . Would he ever see June again ? His father had died many years ago ; he had n't seen him since . From time to time he dreamed of his father standing mute in some family-filled room . Everyone would welcome him , saying , " We all thought you were dead ! " Clare himself would look at the old man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always understood that , in fact , the man was dead . He had no will , no love , and no way to express his embarrassment for the overexcited living . He was an apparition , an illusion the family 's hope could not sustain . Now as winter left the coast that year and spring wore on , Clare dreamed this dream again and again , and others like it . So Clare carried Mabel around the parlor . He was among the living on a certain continent in one of the centuries , and dying early . Day by day the bursting trees in the yard seemed real enough , and the sunlight seemed handmade for the moment 's heat like any fire . But if this was a year among years and him dying , and if the whole lighted , moving scene would play on in his absence , would continue to tumble into the future extending the swath of the lighted and known , moving as a planet rolls with its clouds attached , its waves all breaking at once on its thousand shores and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed by dogs  --  if all this living surface lived on with him dead underneath it in the dark  --  then things were not as they had seemed . Of course he had always known that he was going to die . But he never believed it . VERYWHERE HE WENT he saw Obenchain . For three months he had seen him everywhere : Obenchain brooding at the post office , Obenchain towering over all the men in the store , or pacing the street by the high school , or standing still in the vacant lot below the house . One February Saturday when he and June were intent over spades in the garden , Clare had glanced up to see Obenchain just disappearing down the back alley . The alley ran through a tangle of blackberry bushes ; Clare had leaned on his spade and peered hard through the bushes to learn if Obenchain had kept moving , or had stopped . He could not tell ; he could not determine if he had seen a piece of a man moving , or if he was now seeing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had stood and studied and thought , until he began to see not Obenchain , but his own self as a man with a revolver behind some blackberry bushes might see him : as an isolated and motionless target . Would he fall then handily in his own garden , with his wife at his side holding a spade ? He looked at June . She was breaking clods ; she had not noticed anything . Clare felt immense in his own garden and stripped , as if the garden had been a desert , and Obenchain the very sun . Clare had quit then , and gone back into the house and sat idle , doing nothing , away from the windows . He had told June after some hesitation . It was New Year 's Day ; they were sitting in the kitchen . He told her that he had not long to live , that he would die one of these days or nights soon , that he knew because Beal Obenchain had told him he was going to kill him , and she was not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worried precisely because she never believed that " nothing could be done . " Something could always be done ; that is what people were for . She could , she said , shoot Beal Obenchain . It would be easy . He lived alone in the woods by the tracks where any vagrant , any swindler or gambler or ruined miner or drunken Indian could shoot him for any reason . No one would find him for days ? maybe even forever  --  and no one would ever suspect Clare Fishburn , let alone June Fishburn . Why would these ordinary , quiet townspeople want to murder someone ? Why indeed ? Clare had said . Obenchain was crazy . What if he was just talking ? Why should anyone go murder a poor lonely boy who raved ? Clare knew that Obenchain was not just talking , that Obenchain was in earnest and would kill him . But he did not intend to murder . Capital threats are not capital crimes ; you do not shoot at a man unless he is actually in the process of harming you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man under any circumstances , and you certainly do not let your wife do it . Of course he had thought of oiling his old duck-hunting shotgun , and even of buying a sidearm . He had thought of everything , and here was June thinking of it all again . Do n't go near the water ; do n't go out alone . And we must move . We can move to Portland , tell no one where we are going , and sell this house for cash . You take the train tomorrow and follow with Mabel when someone buys the house . And when do we come back ? Clare saw that June was pink and heated . Her skin was always a thin membrane ; she changed colors faster than a cloud . Her face seemed everywhere as liquid and live as her eyes . She subsided , looking down , but her cheeks still glowed . And when do we come back ? he asked more softly again , and June thought it through and fired up , We do n't come back ! We do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoping every minute he never finds us , or wondering every minute if he actually meant to kill at all ? Or do we hope he decides to murder someone else ? Who ? Clare was waiting for June to calm down . It would take her several days , he thought , to examine their alternatives as he had done , several days to understand that nothing could be done . But he learned throughout the spring that he had been wrong . June wanted to move . As she began to adjust to a new life based on this threat  --  sometimes , she told him , she caught herself wondering how many places she should set for supper  --  as January and . February passed day by day and Clare still lived , still , she wanted to move . Clare did not want to move , and they argued about it . June was serious about moving  --  anywhere  --  and he knew this meant she was willing to give up her home town , her parents ' proximity , and all her friends and their stable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strangers together . She surprised him . He thought about these things throughout the early spring . In the light and changing rains walked to school along the same streets he had al ? ways walked . Obenchain was not likely to gun him down in the streets in front of the neighbors like any gangster . Of course she loved him  --  why was he surprised ? He saw that she acted from an unmentioned source of feeling , a source which , he discovered , he shared . It had been there all along . He wondered if she knew . He wondered if she was conscious of it and understood at once that she was , that she probably had been since Mabel 's birth , when their courting talk had ceased and their enthusiasm had given way to this other thing . She had been waiting for him to notice it , and she understood his doltishness in advance . What else did she know that he did not ? He walked up the streets toward the high school . Heimagined her tilted round head , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How had they found the courage to marry , when they had known nothing ? And Clare felt a bottomlessness in himself ; he felt a bottomlessness to his attachment to June that made him teeter , and he felt a parcel of infinity between them over which the days of their life floated like chips . June wanted to move . But some things are better than other things , Clare said . His firmness surprised him . He chose to live in Port Hammersley , and die when he died and where . He knew that June saw only a new fatalism in his decision , and he wondered if she missed his old boyishness , his old carelessness . He did not . Now it was a Sunday morning late in March . Clare had carried Mabel from the parlor outside to the porch . He toted her round and around the little porch the way he used to when the porch was new and so was Mabel . When had she grown so big and heavy ? She had hushed her crying . Now  --  Clare knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notice her and set her down . He noticed her ; but he wanted to carry her a while longer . It was still early morning . From the porch Clare could hear June rattling jars in the pantry . His mother was upstairs dressing for church . He looked down the hill across the vacant lot where Obenchain had stood ; he looked above the town rooftops and out over the water . The wind blew from the north ; he could see , far away , its white scrapings blow backward over the bay . Pieces of Mabel 's hair blew in his face . She hid her bare arms in his coat . Cloud-parts were leaving the sky . The wood stems of lilac bush by the porch were banging together . Those blunt stems would be gone soon , broken into lilacs . He and June were thirty-one and Mabel was five ; it was Sunday morning . Would he ever see himself now in his own memory , saying , There I was then , on the porch ? No ; these were the only days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the foothill ridgetops ; on the beaches , the morning high tides of winter were gone . Hour by hour a hundred ducks and another hundred ducks departed the water ; night after night Orion dived to the west and died young . The trees were going . All winter Clare had learned his own trees ' strong branches , how they grew and twigged : the cottonwood sapling in the yard with the sky behind it , the Lombardy poplars like leaf-net , the alders yellow-tipped in back of the house . Now those dark lines were blurring ; they were disappearing before his eyes . Clare set Mabel down ; she joined some children in the yard . He felt the blood returning deep in his arms . There was not time enough to honor all that be wanted to honor . It was difficult even to see it . The wind was blowing from the north . Mabel was five . The blunt stems of lilac banged together . Shall these bones remember ? Part Three LL THAT APRIL it rained on the northwest coast . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' fields on the plain . The cemetery east of Port Hammersley became a low lake where ducks in flocks dabbled and dove among headstones . In town , people stood on the river S bridges and watched farmers ' dead chickens float by . When the water went down it was May . Townspeople forgot the flooding ; they began to mend nets and scrape hulls , to make railroad excursions south and hikes into the mountains , to dig clams and plant corn and play ball . The old people knew the season by heart and their hearts turned over anyway , as lakes turn over by the season . The schoolchildren grew careless and distraught ; when school let out in June they hit the streets . There were boy gangs and girl gangs all over the town  --  on the wharf and along the beaches and in mills and logging , camps  --  gangs composed of children few adults thought they had ever seen before . By the third week in June it was summer in earnest . Fledgling songbirds peeped on the lawns of the town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The winds left and the clouds dried up and the sun rolled almost all the way around the sky . The days had widened like a crescendo ; June was a blare of light . There were fivehours of darkness only ; the rest was light . The fishermen fished day and night while the salmon ran , and the canneries worked round the clock . The loggers logged the forests , and their teams of oxen dragged the logs away . It was summer and no one seemed to sleep . Householders patched their roofs and mended fences ; they bought and sold land , acquired puppies , gathered oysters , blasted stumps , and moved pianos . They canned rock cod and salmon in their kitchens and ran outside again to weed their gardens in the sun . It was summer and the sky had fallen open like a clamshell . The days were round and lighted one after another without end . EAL OBENCHAIN SAT outside his shack on a stool . It was the longest day of the year , and a sunny one outside the woods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big male - ) Dungeness crab and most of a smaller male in his crab pot . He ) - had reset the pot with dogfish skin and carried the crabs by their back legs up the path and into the woods . Now he was eat-them . The boiling pot lay on the needled ground between his feet . From time to time he shook the broken shells from his boots . Obenchain lived in the woods on a bluff above the tracks south of town and False Bay . No sun shone anywhere in the woods . There were only tree trunks there : trunks of big fir trees and cedars and hemlocks , whose canopy soaked up the sunlight high overhead and cast a wet shade on the ground and over the ferns and mosses and bushes . From his seat on the stool in front of his shack he could see downhill , through the trunks and boughs and bunched fir-tops , some lengths of shoreline track below and some bright blue strips of water and sky . It had not worked with James Clare Fishburn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You are going to die , " he had said , and this simple townsman had believed him . But he seemed singularly unaffected by it . Obenchain knew Clare avoided the south side of town and the open plain and the forest . He knew he had moved his bed away from the upstairs window and stayed out of taverns all winter and spring . He had frightened him out of his own garden once . He carried a sidearm outside . Obenchain even knew that the man 's wife was badgering him to move . But he also knew that Clare was not dead yet . He was thinkinc , his own thoughts , and Obenchain was uncertain what those thoughts might be . A boyish stupidity had left Clare 's face  --  that was good . But the face had not merely emptied . And when he .. walked in town he no longer searched up and down the streets and glanced behind him , the way he had in winter . His walking gait had wakened . He looked around him always , but not always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Obenchain to surprise Clare in the street ; the subject failed to react . Now Obenchain hated him . Obenchain had meant to observe and preside over the corruption of a man 's spirit . He had meant to kill Clare without leaving a corpse , to kill him legally , by the power of suggestion . But the suggestion had failed . Instead of tormenting himself with indecision , Clare seemed to have made terms with certainty . Obenchain had seen Clare with his family at a boat launching the day before . Clare was among the men who had hoisted the hull in the builder 's shed , hauled it down the beach , and heaved it into the water . Obenchain watched from a log . Clare walked as though he owned the earth . He looked to Obenchain as though he felt he had personally built the boat and the beach and the water , all in his little shop . After the launching the town made a picnic on the beach . Clare and his wife lingered after most of the other families had gone ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wife looked at the water , at the men taking turns rowing the new dory up and down the mild shore ; they kindled a fire . Clare looked as though he had all the time in the world . He looked earnest but contained ; he paid Obenchain no mind . Before the launching he had nodded once at Obenchain and passed the jug to someone else . So now Obenchain sat cracking crab legs in his teeth . There were many things on his mind this June . There was , for example , an artist , a painter of shipwrecks , in town for the summer , a small man whom everyone worshipped as a god , and who was seeking to destroy Obenchain 's reputation as an intellectual . There was a woman , too , who mocked him and caused her image to appear in his mind . And there was James Clare Fishburn , who would n't give up the ghost . What Obenchain considered , crumbling his crabs , was this . Fishburn was afraid , but not destroyed . It was likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It seemed instead to present a clear challenge . Perhaps only uncertainty could destroy . Maybe the Hindoo tied to the wharf had not suffered at all as he waited for the tide to come in and drown him  --  because he was certain the tide would come in . Maybe Obenchain had failed with both of them because his weapons were too crude . If uncertainty would break Fishburn , then Obenchain would have to supply him with more of it . He would take it all back . He would tell him he was not going to kill him . Tell him it was a joke , or an experiment  --  something finished . Then what would Clare do ? What would he believe ? Would he assume the experiment to have just begun ? Since Fishburn was alive so long after Obenchain had told him he was going to die , he had no reason to ? believe anything Obenchain said . Maybe he would think Obenchain a chronic liar , like the Cretan who , when he told you he would not kill you , meant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sometimes lied and sometimes told the truth . He could say , " What I told you in December was a lie , and now this is the truth : you are not going to die , " and let Clare sort it out as best he could . And so Obenchain determined that he would tell ? Clare Fishburn this new thing . He stood up then , and poured the crab water over the ferns by the door . BILE OBENCHAIN cracked crab , Clare Fishburn came walking westward over the Sheepskill plain . He was heading home from a long day alone in the hills . He carried a pole and a creel with several trout . He walked over the plain on a lazy dirt track that traced the Sheepskill down from the hills and wide on a sweeping meander south of town . The river lay low and sleeping ; it was June . The plain lay slow and as flat as the river , poured . The sky lay monumental over the world . Miles away at the eastern rim of the plain the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mountains spread the foothills , blurred , the forested ridges and valleys where Clare had fished . In every other direction the fields gave way directly to the light ; the farmers ' green hayfields curved beyond sight into sky . Clare walked . It was afternoon . A thin , steady wind blew from the north ; it would die off . Overhead the sun was ample . Over the world hung twenty enormous fair-weather clouds . Clare watched the clouds  --  clouds like rocks of foam you could chip  --  and never saw them change ; but when he looked away and looked back he saw that 40 they had changed . They bulged and piled : In the distance he saw a rank of clouds whose bright bottoms reflected a shine from the water  --  so that , if Clare had been a stranger on the plain , he could have guessed from the cloud 's reflections that water lay westward , even though he could not see beyond the fields . Beside him a dense hedge of berries darkened the lip where the fields met the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clare moved across the plain the goldfinches swept before him , burst by burst , and then flew behind him when he had gone too far . He flushed flock after flock , which went looping down the riverside before him . He was walking home . James Clare Fishburn was alive and walking westward over the plain toward the town . He was alone . He was walking home to his wife and child and mother whom he had left alive that morning early . He was remembering a Sunday in the spring , a day a norther had blown and died off in the afternoon ; children were playing in Clare 's side yard . Mabel and some neighbor children were tying each other to a tree . They had found a length of line and were tying each other to the cottonwood sapling Clare had planted the week Mabel was born . Clare watched from the porch . He had forgotten this piece of information : children tie each other to trees . How could he have forgotten ? They tied a small boy to the tree , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could not break away . Clare had looked out over the lilacs and thought , Here is a solid planet stocked with mountains and cliffs , with stone banks and deeply rooted trees . Among those fixed and enduring features wander the flimsy people . And the earth rolls down and the people die ; and the survivors derive solace from clinging  --  not to the rocks , not to the cliffs , not to the trees , but to each other . It was amazing . Loose people clung in families , holding on for dear life . Grasping at straws ! One would think people would beg to be tied to trees . Mabel had stood , five and dubious , lashed in manila rope to the cottonwood tree . " Now let 's tie Jake , " she suggested . Clare laughed and she looked up and saw him . The boy who had cried punched at her . They pretended to shoot at her with bows and arrows . If they tied me to the tree , Clare thought , Obenchain could shoot me . Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft-shelled she is with her bones inside her . If a tree fell or a horse kicked she would break ; if a fever caught her she would burn ; if she fell in the water she would freeze . Could Mabel die , who was only five ? For whom everything had been made so smooth ? Now Mabel was calling her grandmother . She had convinced the others that they should tie her grandmother to the tree . " No , " Clare 's mother had called back from the garden . " That tree is too small . And I am too old . " Could she lie in a grave with her dirt on ? Clare had walked all day . He saw a marsh hawk riding the air slopes over the Sheepskin plain . The big clouds were brightening ; the sunlight shone yellow now on their sides . What could be unthinkable ? When the river curved north Clare 's path left its banks and cut out westward cross-country through the farmlands south of town . He flushed the finches and the finches flew . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forest ahead  --  the uncut railroad right-of-way bumping along the coastal bluffs  --  forest , and a forest-broken lighted band of water . After another mile the path joined a narrow-gauge logging track . The track entered a strip of woods and burst out upon the main line on the shore . Clare blinked in the light , looking out at water . White gulls dropped cockles on the roadbed and lighted to feed on the broken bits . It was evening . The spring tide was in ; it covered the cobble beaches below the railroad bluff . Clare shifted his creel and pole , changing arms , and started northward up the tracks toward the trestle . Looking ahead he saw Obenchain almost at once . It looked like Obenchain . The man lounged inert on the point of bluff where the trestle began over False Bay . His body pointed out toward the sound , but his head lay sideways , resting on naked shoulder and arm , facing down the track toward Clare . It was certainly Obenchain . His chest was bare . Clare could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gun ; he had a knife and some fishhooks . If Obenchain also had no gun , he would simply throw Clare from the bluff . His back would break , or a leg , and he would drown . He studied his own thoughts with little emotion . H they wrestled on the bluff , could he use his knife ? Should he open it now ? He thought he should not open his knife . Obenchain could point any weapon Clare held in any direction Obenchain preferred . He would rather drown in cold water than die of wounds made by his own knife . But it was not an important choice . There was no one else near : there were no teams loading logs from car to car , no men in boats on the water . Obenchain alone was in sight , and Clare was in sight of Obenchain and the yellow clouds ; and Obenchain looked for all the world as if he was expecting Clare and waiting for him . And so Clare carried on up the tracks toward Obenchain . Obenchain raised his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand . Clare camehis legs were trees moving . He knew he was walking as if he were opening something as a boat 's bow opens the water . He himself was being opened , as if Obenchain were a table saw . He was a clod of dirt that the light splits , or a peeled fish . Time kept rolling back and bearing him : he was as porous as clouds or bones . He was opening time like a path in high grass . When Obenchain stood and stopped him and told him he was not going to kill him , he was not going to die , Clare was looking out over the trestle and down to the water where gulls flew without bending - their wings . The tide was in , slack at the flood , white , over False Bay . There was a plank walkway on the trestle beside the rails . Clare stepped alone onto the walkway , nodding , serious , holding his breath as if he were diving . The trestle moved and Clare walked out over the bay and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his shoulders ; sky arched beneath his feet . " No , " he said to Obenchain  --  hut Obenchain was far behind him on the bluff ? " I am going to die . " Someday I will die . The sky came carousing down around him . He was a wiped plate . He saw the sun drenching the green westward islands and battering a path down the water . He saw the town before him where the trestle lighted down . And far out on the Sheepskill plain beyond the False Bay cliffs he saw a man walking , turning his pea rows under in perfect silence , walking behind his horse and plow . He saw again on the plain to the north another man walking and turning the green ground under . And before him on the trestle over the water he saw the earth itself walking , the earth walking darkly as it has always walked in every season : it was plowing the men under , and the horses under , and the plows . The earth was plowing the men under , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the plows . No toward Obenchain because Oben- wonder you are cold , he said to chain sat in his present path. - ? Itiffj ? - the broken earth , he said to the ation sees it happen , and the damp new fields grow up forgetting . Clare was burrowing in light upstream . No , he said , peeling the light back , walking in the sky toward home : no. 0
