Listen here . Donna Summer has something to tell you : " You . . . are beautiful . Each . . . and . . . every . . . one . . . of . . . you . . . is . . . beautiful ! That 's right ! And if you got it , then . . . I say . . . you ought to flaunt it ! " <P> That does n't sound like the old Donna Summer talking . But then , she 's singing a different tune too . Back in 1976 , on her first hit , Love to Love You Baby , she got a gold record by simulating orgasm 22 times and cajoling , in her best jailbait voice , " Do it to me again and again . " Her latest hit , taken from her platinum album , Live and More , is a discofied rendering of Jimmy L. Webb 's Mac Arthur Park , in which Donna can rise above the hot-pants reveries of her earlier work into the headier regions of post-psychedelic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in the rain/ I do n't think that I can take it/ ' Cause it took so long to make it/ And I 'll never have the recipe again , oh no . " <P> Flaunt it , Donna . While you got it . <P> What she 's got , most prominently , is a first-rate set of pipes , a ringing , theatrical voice that is locked in continual combat with the layered sound and dunce-cap lyrics of disco . With one platinum and five gold albums , Summer , 29 , is the one incontestable star to emerge from the disco demimonde . Love to Love You Baby became a hit in the days when discos were not sprouting on every block , but were stashed in the closet along with the gay subculture from which they sprang . <P> The song 's smash success coincided with disco 's coming-out party , and became a kind of marching song for the disco revolution . Donna continues to ride high and handsome as the craze vaults all class barriers , from blue-collar to caf society . Still big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act that she is currently taking through 14 cities before invading the citadel , Las Vegas . Eager to wade into the musical mainstream , Donna dusts off The Man I Love and Some of These Days and presses them into a stage extravaganza that does n't yield an inch to good taste . <P> Arms flung wide , blowing kisses like confetti , Donna sashays around the stage in glittering costumes , exhorting the audience ( " You are beautiful " ) , joshing the band , trading a little prefabricated bitchiness with her backup singers who undulate at sharp angles like clockwork Nefertitis when Donna wraps herself around a lyric . " I do not consider myself a disco artist , " Donna insists , against all contrary evidence . " I consider myself a singer who does disco songs . What I like to do is expose my market to other parts of music . " <P> Donna 's market is as broad as her expectations . After an appearance in a disco showcase quickie called Thank God It 's Friday , she is primed to act . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't have to take coaching . I can act . All I have to do is be myself playing someone else . I could be a Bette Davis-type actress . Catty , cold , precise and domineering. "
