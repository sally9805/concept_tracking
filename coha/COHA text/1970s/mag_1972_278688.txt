In theory , the technique sounds like a natural for candidates seeking office in the electronic age . Rent a computer . Cram it with the names , telephone numbers and demographic particulars of a million or so voters . Feed in recorded messages by the candidate , slanting each pitch to appeal to a different ethnic or social group . Plug in a bank of telephones . Push a few buttons . And bleep , whir , dingaling , the machines tirelessly canvass the constituency with " personalized " calls ( TIME , Jan. 10 ) . <P> In practice , however , the computer phone banks have blown a few fuses . For one thing , there is no telling how intrusive or untimely a call might be . For another , the computer 's cross sections can get crossed up , misdirecting messages , say , about substandard housing to wealthy WASPs or promising new employment opportunities to retired senior citizens . That kind of cross-up happened to the statewide computerized campaign of one candidate in the Florida primary . No machine recorded the reaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibilities are several : <P> Candidate : Hello-this is Hubert Humphrey on a recorded message . <P> Voter : Hubert who ? <P> Candidate : I 'd like just a moment of your time . . . <P> Voter : I do n't have a moment . <P> Candidate : ... to talk about the Florida presidential primary . <P> Voter : You woke the baby . <P> Candidate : The stakes are high this election year . <P> Voter : You must be high to call here right in the middle of the Flip Wilson Show . <P> Candidate : We must support Israel . . . <P> Voter : Israel ? What about us poor blacks right here at home ? <P> Candidate : . . . providing her with the arms . . . <P> Voter : Arms ? How about providing for all the mouths I got to feed ? <P> Candidate : . . . she needs-and now ! <P> Voter : Man , have you got the wrong number ! ( Click . ) <P> Fortunately , perhaps , other snags caused the Humphrey computer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calls per day . Sobered by the experience , the Senator 's aides now suspect that the day of saturation is fast arriving . In Wisconsin , they used only one basic message-and that only in Milwaukee County .
