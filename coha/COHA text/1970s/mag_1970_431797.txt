 | The Case for Central Air Conditioning @# Yesterday 's air conditioner ? the win-mounted appliance that merely . A cold air into a room ? will soon be obsolete as the electric fan . Toair too often needs more than a in temperature to make it fit to be with . So air conditioning is now composite of functions that takes whatever atmosphere this age of pollution happens to waft into your back yard and transforms it into a houseful of air worth breathing . Not just in the summer , but in the winter as well ? and 24 hours a day . New and updated systems now make it possible for you to control the climate inside your home . And you can add many of the features of such systems to your existing heating system ? especially if you already have hot-air ducts . ? Continuous air circulation ? 24 hours a day , all year around ? is now considered essential to effective air treatment . To implement this , General Electric , for one , has devised controls that produce two levels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes , the system senses the need for more or less volume and adjusts to output automatically . In some gasfueled cooling-heating systems , the flame rises and lowers . ? Quiet air circulation is here , now that ductwork has some of the corners rounded and may be made of fiberglass . Along with this , nearly all manufacturers have switched to squirrel-cage fans . Bryant has a motor slowed down to 800 rpm for greater quiet . The noise of compressors is now housed inside high-mass castings and hardly a whisper escapes . ? Design is tightened . Central air-@# MAY 1970 167  | treatment systems are as much as onethird smaller . You no longer have to give up half a garage or basement to equipment . Part of the compactness is due to all-in-one designs . Williamson puts heating , cooling , humidification , and air purification all in one small unit , as do several other manufacturers , in products balanced a bit more toward winter than summer . ? Exterior cooling units , an integral part of most high-capacity airtreatment systems , are now actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carrier has an outdoor component that discharges hot air straight up , thus sparing nearby shrubs that would be scorched by air discharged laterally . Another improvement in the outdoor component is one that has air intake and outlet on one side , so that it can be mounted in an above-grade basement wall . Electronic filters of Westinghouse 's " Precipitron " type , are capable of removing almost 100 percent of pollen , smoke , dust , and other contaminants . Bryant has one that you throw away when a pilot light comes en to tell you it 's full of dirt . Other varieties can be hosed off and put back into service without even a delay for drying . Air-purification units may also include a germicide in a permanent form ; it does n't wash off . The Fedders electronic control has a " sail " switch that turns the air cleaner on when the air starts to move , turns it off when the air stops , and thus saves operating and upkeep costs . ? New devices have been developed that absorb odors from air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Carrier , uses a filter bathed by a chemical solution in which odors are continuously absorbed and then boiled off through an outside vent . The solution , incidentally , also washes the filter , ending the need for filter cleaning or replacement . As if that were n't enough , it provides the humidifying function needed in wintertime heating . ? Choice of fuel ( oil , gas , electricity ) is available in most major lines , letting you pick the one that is most efficient and economical in your area . ? The heat pump is making a return after early disappointments . Airtemp has one now that will give you 44,000 BTU of cooling and 47,000 BTU of heating . Lennox covers the complete heating-cooling arc with a unit that automatically delivers its air cooled or warmed , depending on household temperatures . ? Cooling phases of air treatment automatically dehumidify to a com fortable moisture content , but warming phases dehydrate the air , so moisture must be added . The systems the 70s will add 15 to 20 gallon water a day ? or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , those initials do n't stand for central air conditioning , but rather for the la concept in total climate systems trolled air circulation . Any system that does n't feature CAC is less efficient . Fortunately , CAC can added to most existing systems- - only new installations . A spokesman for Lennox , citing advantages of CAC , points out on-and-off systems have a cycling recycling of good air , then lessgood . While the equipment is there 's no improvement in the When it cycles on , the situation slowly better , until full treatment in operation . Then it cycles off . the total situation gets slowly wo until it zeros off and sits there w ing for the cycle to start again . M while , rooms do not react equally either the on or the off phase . As result , the so-called central air tr ment system is spotty throughout house and throughout the day . CAC working all the time , tends to ave out conditions so that a room that hard to cool " borrows some of @#  | cool " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out works in heating . In case after case , home owners report savings in fuel up to 25 percent since there are no lows to recover from no need to overwork to catch up . Air that 's fit to breathe also makes for easier housework . Draperies . walls , floor coverings , upholstery all y clean longer . The slight inside sure produced by continuous air circulation keeps dirt-laden air from coming in through inevitable cracks and crevices in the construction . Peace and quiet are additional advantages . With windows and doors ut , less outside noise intrudes . Harder for burglars , too . ) Your year for climate control ? About eight percent of homes in America have central air conditioning . Over a illion systems were installed last ear . About one in three new homes s up with central air conditioning . has reached a point where homes with air conditioning are snapped off e real-estate market , while other houses sit ? they 're underequipped . Building a house ? It makes less than sense to let a new house go up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleans , and controls humidity . The mechanical equipment required costs less at the time of construction ( because of efficiencies in combined heating-cooling units ) than it does as an add-on later . However , if there are budget reasons why the complete system can not go into a new house now , the wise thing is to have the engineering and design phases done . That way , you 'll be ready for simple add-on , later . If you own a house with a ducted warm-air system , you may be only a short step away from CAC : MAY 1970 j 69 Put a pinch between gum and cheek , and enjoy it . Without even chewing . The smokeless tobaccos are too good to smoke . 1 You get all the satisfaction of prime aged tobaccos . They cost less , too . Sure beats smoking !  | ?

A new do-it-yourself kit lets you add central air conditioning to your present forced-air heating system for about $450 ; it involves less than a day 's work with ordinary shop tools . ( For information , write Albion Div. , McGraw-Edison , 71.4E No . Clark St. , Albion , Mich. 49224 . ) ? Older warm-air systems may not have the air-moving capacity , since cold , heavy air is harder to push around than warm , light air . In this case , the fairly simple solution is replacement of the old fan with a larger one . ? In an old house heated with a gravity air system , or perhaps updated from gravity to a version of forced air by introduction of a blower , the problem becomes greater ? and so variable that generalities are risky . You 'll get your best answer from a local air-conditioning contractor . However , in a great many cases , it is possible to hook a cooling coil into the system in a way that will produce satisfactory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side benefits of air cleaning and humidification , however , unless you junk the old furnace and replace it with modern warm-cool equipment . That is , in fact , the recommendation of most air-conditioning authorities , who point out that a modern all-function unit is so efficient that it will do its job even when hampered by less-than-excellent ductwork . And it will do its heating work so much better than the old system that the new one pays for itself . ? If your house is an old two-story building , it might be best to add cooling to the furnace and let it handle the first floor . Then , install a small unit in the attic to cool the upstairs . ? In a hot-water-heated home ? the " hydronic " system ? the problem is still tougher . You can replace simple hydronic radiators with recently developed units , which include small fans and rather more elaborate fins to transfer heat . In hot weather , chilled water runs through these radiators . The authorities say that the cooling is excellent , but the cost is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do not get the benefits of cleaned air , nor of whole-house continuous air circulation . When the decision in a hydronic heated house is to install a central system , ducts go in through basement . or crawl space or attic . For a two-story house , you use basement work to handle the first floor attic duckwork to handle the second . The ducts are often easy to tuck corners and along ceiling edges . Serious thought should be given to E replacement of a hydronic system with an entirely new CAC central system , particularly if you 're operating an old furnace with old-fashioned radiators . You 'll save space , and r. of the cost of a new installation be relieved by the efficiency of a modern system , plus the reduced up and maintenance charges of one tern vs. two .

In most houses with interconnecteing living room , dining room , kitchen , family room -- and hallways -- the only confinable rooms are bedrooms . Thus a room conditioner can do a good job in one bedroom . Two of them handle two bedrooms . It takes three for three . And -- at about the level of three room-size conditioners , your investment starts to reach the cost of a central system . This is particularly true if you resort to an outsize model , hoping to take care of a combination living-dining situation . Room units are becoming more sophisticated . They now have models that sense temperature needs and modulate to produce the comfort level desired . Some models even have a reversal phase . When it gets too cool , they turn on the heat and move warm air into the room . Some have two or three levels of output , and you can set them to meet changing conditions . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systems that serve mainly make sleeping rooms comfortable during intolerable weather . Central equipment is likely to have a basic engineering advantage over a window air conditioner ; the two systems evolved from different sources . Window units have traveled the home-appliance route , and their projected life is about seven years . Central home equipment , on the other hand , is an outgrowth of industrial installations ? sophisticated systems designed for office buildings . The projected life of such equipment is at least 20 years . Can you pre-guess costs ? Not very accurately . Too much depends on the orientation of the house , the size and position of its windows , even the color of its roof ( a light roof reflects heat , while a dark one can add as much as 20 percent to the heat load ) . Insulation is even more of a factor in cooling than it is in heating , for the simple reason that vast excesses of heat can be produced when the heat loss is high , but it is impossible to produce enough cold , cleaned , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The industry does have some rules of thumb on costs : ? A house that is well designed , well built , and well insulated will require roughly 12,000 BTU for every 600 square feet of floor space . In new construction you 'll pay somewhere around $225 to $250 for each 12,000 BTU of cooling . ? In an existing house the cost is a little more than new construction ? about $250 to $375 per 12,000 BTU. @# @#
