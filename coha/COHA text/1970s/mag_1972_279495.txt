Freedom House , a nonpartisan political-education organization based in Manhattan , last week issued a year-end summary of the political state of the world 's 3.3 billion people . As measured by the health of their courts , press and other institutions , 1,029,910,000 people are " free " ( in the Western states , India and Japan , among others ) , while another 720,630,000 are " partly free " ( among them : the South Vietnamese ) . But fully 1,583,551,000 people-nearly one-half the world 's population- " suffer severe political and civil deprivations . " The year 's big loser was Africa , which showed " an almost irreversible trend toward more military and one-party states . "
