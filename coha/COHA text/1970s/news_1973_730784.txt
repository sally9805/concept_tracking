txt George McGovern 's 1972 political director , Frank Mankiewicz , says he is ' taking a new , hard look at " the extent of interference in the McGovern campaign , " and that he can , already , report on a number of such " incidents " Of the source of this interference ; he says : " " I assume it was , the Republicans , in view of their known campaign of sabotage . " DeVan Shumway , director of public affairs of the Committee for the Reelection of the President , had this Comment : " I hope he is prepared to repeat these kinds of charges in the appropriate legislative and judicial hearings , if he thinks they are accurate . I do n't have any knowledge of any effort of that sort . It sounds kind of silly and childish to me . This is one aspectof what the hearings are about , to look into , these things . " // * ' 72 campaign : odd ' incidents ' // " I can tell you , " Mr. Mankiewicz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , afterward , either McGovern or I or someone else in our , campaign party would say , ' That was a pretty good crowd . ' And then the rally chairman would say something like this , ' You bet it was a pretty good crowd , considering that you called it off two days ago . ' " Then , " Mr. Mankiewicz says , " the chairman would say that he had received a call purportedly but not really from the McGovern headquarters ( state or national ) . saying ' It 's called off . Forget it . ' " " Then the chairman would get an official call from our advance man and reschedule the event . " Also , we know for certain that at least twice in the Midwest there was evidence of deliberate sabotage . "
