Where is Camilla Crociani ? Until February , the sleek and personable Crociani , 55 , was chief of a state-owned holding company called Finmeccanica . Now he is the subject of a man hunt by Italian police and Interpol . They want to question him about charges that one of his privately owned companies laundered part of a $1.6 million payoff when Lockheed Aircraft Corp . sold 14 C-130 transport planes to Italy 's air force in 1971 . Just before the scandal broke , Crociani emptied his penthouse in Rome and his two lavish country homes of all personal documents-and vanished . <P> <P> What troubles Italians as much as the alleged payoff is Crociani 's inept handling of the public 's business . Finmeccanica is one of Italy 's many ventures in " mixed capitalism . " With this system , which started under Mussolini in 1933 , the state buys or creates firms to promote broad social goals-and make a profit . Today the government controls or has interests in companies that account for about 50% of Italy 's industrial output . Finmeccanica owns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $1.5 billion last year . Crociani took over in 1974 ; in just one year he tripled the group 's losses to an estimated $450 million . <P> No Accounting . Had the Lockheed scandal not surfaced , this dismal performance might have gone unnoticed . Traditionally the top managers of state-owned corporations have formed a sottogoverno ( subgovernment ) that runs their enterprises with so little supervision that they do not even bother to keep the public or the official government up to date on what they are doing . Earlier this month , for example , the giant Institute for Industrial Reconstruction ( I.R.I. ) , which controls 15% of all Italian industry , got around to releasing its consolidated balance sheet-for 1974 . If the manager of a state-owned enterprise blundered , the government would quietly come to the company 's rescue with grants and loans . <P> But last year recession hit the Italian economy especially hard , and the Christian Democratic Party , which has been in power for 30 uninterrupted years , found that it was losing votes . So the government stopped playing economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Christian Democrats also decided that they had to let the managers face the consequences of their business decisions . <P> <P> Heads soon began to roll . In May 1975 , Mario Einaudi , freewheeling chief of a state-owned mining and textile conglomerate , was forced to resign after he highhandedly tried to gain control of a Genoa shipping , insurance and newspaper group without informing the government . Next to go was Raffaele Girotti , chairman of ENI , who had led the big state petroleum company to a $95 million loss . Camillo Crociani , apparently recognizing that his job was shaky , chose not to wait for the ax . <P> His flight has drawn even more attention to the woes of the state corporations . Just a few weeks ago , for example , Finsider , a state group of 24 steel-producing companies , came under fire for continuing to roll out steel all last year despite a global glut . The reason was to keep employment high , but the result was staggering losses that no private company could afford .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
