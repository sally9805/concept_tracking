It 's a serious , stern , responsible deed , To help an unfortunate soul in need , And your one reward , when you quiet his plaint , Is to feel like an opulent , careworn saint . <P> - Clarence Day <P> THE American view of charity has altered considerably since the kindly Mr. Day wrote Life With Father . To many , his notion seems oldfashioned , more closely allied with the times of the original good Samaritan than with the thrust of contemporary society . Charity , the fundamental decency of one man helping a less fortunate fellow , seems hopelessly out of date in the era of the welfare state , social activism and racial and ethnic tensions . <P> To various elements in contemporary American society , the traditional idea of personal charity seems pointless . The liberal posture , devolved from Franklin Delano Roosevelt 's welfare state , holds that benefits for the poor , the sick , the needy are in fact their civil right , and should not be dependent on the largesse of some kindhearted , well-heeled benefactor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a patronizing concept . <P> On the other hand , many conservatives are scornful of the operators and supporters of government benevolence ; they speak of bleeding hearts who coddle people too irresponsible to carve their own living in a plentiful nation . The left-wing radicals take an equally harsh view . They feel that the entire system is so corrupt that not even the existing official machinery can correct society 's ills , much less the minuscule efforts of an individual . Thus a man who , say , sponsors a ghetto child for two summer weeks in the country might be accused by the politically devoted liberal of ignoring the proper government channels , sneered at by a right-wing zealot as a " do-gooder " and denounced by a Weatherman as an irrelevant pander to a sick system . <P> Lifelong Crusade <P> Yet do-gooder is not everywhere an epithet , and charity remains a vital force . Fortunately , there are many Americans who still practice it . Indeed , there are indications that it is returning to vogue in new forms . All kinds of people are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the communes of the young , for example , a novel institution in modern America , could not survive without direct , highly personal human interdependence . <P> Certainly a sense of moral obligation to the needy is deeply implanted in the American character . Day 's " opulent , careworn saint " is a firm fixture in the national legacy . John Winthrop , Puritan leader and first Governor of Massachusetts , probably laid down the first American do-gooder 's covenant when he told his flock : " We must love one another with a pure heart fervently , we must bear one another 's burdens , we must look not only on our own things , but also on the things of our brethren . " William Penn was a tireless proponent of charity : ' The best recreation is to do good . " There will be opportunity for lighter pursuits " when the pale faces are more commiserated , the pinched bellies relieved and the naked backs clothed , when the famished poor , the distressed widow and the helpless orphan are provided for . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man ask , Why is it so necessary to do good ? I must say , it sounds not like the question of a good man . "
