txt Edward Heath has been defeated in the election for the Conservative Party leadership in Britain ? by a woman . The woman is Margaret Thatcher , member of Mr. Heath 's last Conservative Cabinet and now her party 's chief speaker on economic affairs in Parliament . She ran ahead of Mr. Heath in Tuesday 's first ballot for the Conservative leadership , but her lead was not big enough under party rules for her to get the job . It was big enough to get Mr. Heath to withdraw from the race , however . Mr. Heath announced after the first ballot that he would not allow his name to go forward for the second ballot Feb. 11 . By then other candidates may have moved into the race and party pressure may well be put on Mrs. Thatcher to follow Mr. Heath 's example and withdraw in favor of a compromise candidate commanding broad party support and thought capable of binding up the party 's wounds . Toughness questioned The alternative with the broadest support seems to be William White-law , now chairman of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Heath 's Minister for Northern Ireland in the last Conservative Cabinet . Mr. Whitelaw is a landowner from near the Scottish border . He has a reputation for decency and understanding other people 's point of view . But British political commentators have repeatedly asked whether he has the toughness for the political battles that a prospective Prime Minister almost inevitably has to face . Another possible second-ballot candidate is James Prior , also a member of Mr. Heath 's last Cabinet , and back in the 1960s Mr. Heath 's parliamentary private secretary . Both he and Mr. Whitelaw would not let their names go forward on the first ballot out of loyalty to Mr. Heath . In the first ballot , Mrs. Thatcher unexpectedly led Mr. Heath by 130 to 116 . To have automatically succeeded him in the leadership without a runoff , she needed a total of 139 votes and at the same time to be 42 votes ahead of him . ( In the first ballot , 16 votes went to a third candidate , Hugh Fraser , husband of Lady Antonia Fraser , noted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James I. ) // *Who is to replace Heath ? // Mr. Heath led the Conservatives to defeat in three of the last four general elections . Few would challenge his gifts and skills , but many Conservatives may have felt impelled to vote against him because of : ( 1 ) his record of losing general elections ; and ( 2 ) his style ? particularly when first Prime Minister ? which his critics said showed that he felt he always knew best and that he treated as foes even fellow Conservatives who questioned his policies . Right-wing appeal Whatever happens to him now , he is certain to go down in history as the Prime Minister who got Britain into the European Common Market . Mrs. Thatcher 's heading of the first ballot in the leadership poll is a remarkable achievement for any woman ? and particularly within the traditionally inclined Conservative Party . Although not herself strictly aright-winger , she - appeals to the Economist ) individual liberty , thrift , and application . She argued that Mr. Heath had got the party into trouble with the electorate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Thatcher could still be denied the party leadership on the second ballot , the Economist ( which backed Mr. Heath ) wrote of her : " Mrs. Thatcher is so well organized . With a house , a flat , only one daily help , looking after her husband , children , and constituency , as well as politics , she has to be . Her immaculate appearance reflects her life-style , nothing is ever out of place . . . . It would be bad for her fair coiffure but good for her image if occasionally instead of going to the hair dresser she visited a wind tunnel . "
