ADLAI STEVENSON OF ILLINOIS by JOHN BARTLOW MARTIN 828 pages . Doubleday . $15 . <P> <P> Harry Truman had just announced that he would not seek re-election in 1952 . Democrats anxiously converged on Illinois Governor Adlai Stevenson and pressured him to make the race . His head buried in his hands , almost on the verge of tears , Adlai blurted : " This will probably shock you , but at the moment , I do n't give a damn what happens to the country . " <P> By the standards of 1976 , when a clutch of candidates are lusting for the presidency , that anomie seems as remote as the Age of Jefferson . But it was typically Stevensonian . The candidate 's constantly expressed reluctance endeared him to his followers , who considered him too good for politics , a man of rare sensibility and cultivated aloofness . There is much to support such a view of Stevenson in this first major biography , which carries him through his defeat in the 1952 presidential election . <P> <P> But John Bartlow Martin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another , more driven side to the Democratic standardbearer . He was , in fact , a practical politician who played the game as skillfully as the next man . His fastidious grumbling about the demands of politics was something of a pose . Martin suggests that the candidate deliberately contrived a diffident persona to appeal to the civic-minded , rather snobbish liberals who came to adore him . <P> Stevenson 's biographer traces his ambition-as well as his self-doubts-to an obscure boyhood tragedy . At 13 he accidentally shot and killed another child . Stevenson never mentioned the episode in later life , but Martin discerns veiled references to it in letters and conversations . A sense of guilt never entirely left the boy or the man ; his life was to be an atonement for that death . Stevenson once wrote a woman whose son had a similar experience : " Tell him he must live for two . " <P> Oscillating Campaigner . For all the admiration of Stevenson 's intellect , he was rather indifferent to abstract thought . He finished in the middle of his class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That embarrassing event was not brought up in two presidential campaigns because the dean , a Stevenson admirer , kept the proof locked in his personal safe . But after earning a law degree from Northwestern University , Stevenson embarked with gusto on a career of public service . <P> Prior to World War II , he became one of the nation 's leading interventionists , attempting to swing the U.S. as soon as possible to Great Britain 's cause . <P> When America entered the war , Steven son joined the Navy Department in Washington . Later he helped draw up the Charter of the United Nations . With this activist background , he was tapped to run for Governor in 1948 by Chicago 's Cook County Democratic politicians . Then as now , the machine was concerned with cleaning up its image .
