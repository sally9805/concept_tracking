txt Senator George came to West Virginia 's coal country today to assert that the Government should " put an end to the strip mining that is destroying much of this beautiful state . " The Democratic Presidential nominee also declared , in an " Agenda for Human Concerns in Appalachia " that he issued here , that the clear-cutting of trees should be abolished in the Monongahela National Forest and a Federal study group should make recommendations on " changing this practice " in all national forests . Clear-cutting involves the removal of all timber from a wooded area . About 700 persons cheered the Senator 's opposition to strip mining at a rally outside the Logan County Courthouse , which is eight miles from the Appalachian hollows where the Hatfields and the McCoys once feuded . West Virginia , which has six electoral votes of the 270 needed to win the Presidential election , is not likely to be a major campaign battleground . But Mr. apparently sought , in an overnight stop in Huntington and a seven-hour motorcade through the mist-covered hills of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Nixon 's use of stand-in campaigners . " West Virginia was the last of the 50 states that President Nixon visited , " John D. Rockefeller 4th , the Democratic gubernatorial candidate , told the audience here . " He only came for an hour , to crown a queen , and left , and he has n't been back , since , " Mr. Rockefeller added . Theme Embellished Mr. , embellishing the same theme , said : " I do n't think you 're going to see Richard Nixon in Logan County . He sneaks out once in a while In a helicopter and drops in someplace for a few minutes . " But he 's sitting there in the White House , smugly on top of his Gallup Poll , thinking that everything is safe and sound and that all he has to do is , print those slogans around the country ? ' Re-elect the President . ' He ' does n't even tell us what his name is . He just says , ' Re-elect the President ' But if my name was Nixon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In advocating an end to strip mining  --  in which coal near , the surface is dug from the earth , leaving deep gashes in the hillsides  --  Mr. al lied himself with Representative Ken Hechler , Democrat of West Virginia , and Mr. Rockefeller , the West Virginia Secretary of State who made the issue part of his successful bid for the gubernatorial nomination . Mr. Hechler was a consultant on the Appalachian " agenda . " Mineral and timber resources " are being torn furiously from the land by the practices of strip mining and clear-cutting , techniques which leave gaping wounds that will never heal , Senator 's statement said . He contended that the Nixon Administration 's efforts at ' enforcing the Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969 had " bordered on gross neglience " and pledged , if elected President , to transfer the enforcement authority from the Department of the Interior to " a Secretary of Labor who is picked ' from the ranks of labor . " The Appalachian " agenda " also included the following proposals : ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the black lung compensation program that had been denied by the Nixon Administration to miners who said they had suffered from extended exposure to coal dust . ! Consideration of Federal payments to communities with tax bases limited by the setting aside of hugh tracts as protected national forests . ! An immediate halt to the purchase of strip-mined coal by the Tennessee.Valley Authority and the establishment of citizen representation on the board of directors of T.V.A. and other hydroelectric power ' projects , as well as the election of some representatives on the Appalachian Regional Commission . ! Enactment of a bill to compensate victims of brown lung ( infection by cotton dust ) and the appointment of a national committee of workers to ' ' evaluate working conditions " in mills where cotton dust could be a problem . Mr. and his wife , Eleanor  --  who wore a new gold campaign pin that resembled the silhouette of a B-24 , which her husband piloted in World War II ? toured the Island Creek Coal Company 's machine shop in nearby Holden , W. Va. , before continuing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The stops in heavily Democratic Logan County struck the tone that Senator has been seeking to project ? confidence that he can win , as an underdog , with the help of traditional working-class Democrats . Shunning the Polls " Please , do n't look at the public opinion polls , " Mr. urged here . ( The polls show him 34 percentage points behind President Nixon . ) " Look at your own interests . Look in , your own hearts . Look in your ' own minds and vote Richard Nixon out of office . " Although some people here ' in Logan and in Holden said they were uncertain whether to support Senator , many said they would vote for him because he was the Democratic nominee . As one elderly man put it , " Even if he was a worm , he 'd be better than what we got . " And one aide said the campaign should adopt the outlook of the song " Worried Man , " which was played out . side the courthouse by a five . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man to sing a worried song , I 'm worried now but I won't1 be worried long .
