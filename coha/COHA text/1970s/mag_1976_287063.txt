In one important respect , the U.S. Navy has fallen badly behind the Soviets . According to the U.S. Navy 's own statistics , the Red Navy now has 563 combat vessels , v. the U.S. Navy 's 285 . Seeking to narrow the gap , the U.S. Navy has undertaken an ambitious building program that by the mid-1980s could bring the fleet up to 600 submarines and surface warships . <P> But the effort is imperiled because two of the nation 's most important shipbuilders no longer want to produce ships for the U.S. Navy under present contract conditions . Litton Industries , whose Pascagoula , Miss. , shipyard is building radically new generations of gas-turbine-powered destroyers and big helicopter assault ships , has petitioned a federal court in Los Angeles for a ruling that in effect would permit the company to halt construction of the assault ships on Aug. 1 . Similarly , the giant Newport News shipyard , a subsidiary of Tenneco , has asked a federal court for permission to stop work on a guided-missile cruiser . On its own , the Newport News @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has suspended construction of the most advanced U.S. nuclear carrier , the Carl Vinson . <P> The trouble is money . The ships are being paid for under old contracting procedures that the companies insist did not recognize how rapidly inflation and design changes would kick up their construction costs . Result : builders are presenting $2.4 billion in past claims ; the Navy will only recognize $1.9 billion . Meanwhile , the shipbuilders are forced to dip into their own working capital to finance construction . They complain that the Navy has been trying to build too many ships with too little money . " You can not expect a private company to finance the U.S. Navy , " declares Glen McDaniel , chairman of Litton 's executive committee . <P> He has a point . The rules and regulations surrounding the contract for a single naval vessel are so byzantine that a truthful U.S. Navy should name a frigate the U.S.S. Franz Kafka . In order to soothe congressional critics , the Navy often insists on an unrealistically low price in the initial contract . Then the specifications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , causing delays and costly modifications . Navy-supplied weaponry often arrives late , and payments frequently run behind schedule . The amount of paper work involved in shipbuilding is mountainous . Litton has assembled 1 tons of documentation , made up largely of Navy design changes , to justify its claims . <P> The shipbuilders ' claims have been bitterly denounced by Admiral Hyman Rickover , the father of the nuclear Navy . His nuclear propulsion division happens to be responsible for many of the costly design changes at the Newport yard , where 16 nuclear-powered vessels are under construction . Rickover describes the claims as potentially " one of the biggest rip-offs in the history of the U.S. " He charges that the builders are owned by industrial conglomerates that " do n't care whether they are making ships or horse turds.
