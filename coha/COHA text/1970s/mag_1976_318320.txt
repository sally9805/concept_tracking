SPEEDBOAT <P> by RENATA ADLER <P> 178 pages . Random House . $7.95 . <P> Many people believe that a book called a novel will offer a group of characters moving along a plot line with something approximating forward momentum . Many are also equally certain that they have heard quite enough , thank you , about the miseries of Manhattan neurotics . Normally , such convictions are not only sound but healthy ; when acted upon , they protect the wary reader from a good deal of gibberish and whining . Still , any critical principle worth holding is also worth ignoring if a good occasion arises . Speedboat-a non-novel novel about Manhattan neurotics-is such an occasion . <P> New Yorker Journalist Renata Adler 's special purview has often been the odd schizophrenia induced in those Americans who came of age ( as she did ) in the 1950s-a generation that was too young to cheer the System and too old to blow it up . The seven stories in Speedboat , though cast as fiction , really form an extended reporter 's notebook on the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find to go slowly bonkers . <P> Land Mine . The stories-or rather , the collage of perceptions-are told by a woman whose last name is Fain and whose first name may be Jennifer ( one friend , at least , calls her Jen ) . Success seems to have fallen on her from a great height . She traipses obligingly but glumly through a succession of jobs usually thought to be desirable : newspaper reporter , foundation consultant , college teacher , congressional staff worker . She is clearly getting somewhere ; where , exactly , and whether it is a place worth being are answers that elude her . " Things , " she muses , " have changed very much , several times , since I grew up , and , like everyone in New York except the intellectuals , I have led several lives and I still lead some of them . " <P> Fain or no Fain , the author of that sentence is Renata Adler . Who else could hide a land mine under well-tended prose with quite as much apparent innocence ? It takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exempted from the frantic metamorphoses demanded by modern life . Why ? The answer comes in bits and pieces : anyone who accepts ( or demands ) the label intellectual is automatically too dumb to deserve it . To prove the point , Adler puts her heroine through a year of teaching , " by mistake , " at a Manhattan college , surrounded by " feather bedding illiterates " and " reactionary pedants . " Visiting Professor Fain notes : " Our full professors , tenured faculty , teach H.B.A. , or Hours by Appointment ; that is , never . " Students are awarded " Prior Life Experience " credits for such things as raking famous people 's lawns . This may look like slapstick . But it sounds , to anyone who has brushed against academe , horribly true . Paragraph by paragraph , vignette by vignette , Speedboat hilariously builds an unsettling case : truth is slapstick . No wonder attentive , sensitive people begin to go weird : " A ' self-addressed envelope , ' if you are inclined to brood , raises deep questions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
