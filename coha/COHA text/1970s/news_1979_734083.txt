txt More than a peace treaty between Egypt and Israel rides on President Carter 's journey to the Middle East . More than Jimmy Carter 's standing in the public opinion polls , too . This President turns out to be devoted to the art of diplomatic brinkmanship , a highstake roller in global negotiations . Sometimes , as with Panama , China , the Pentagon budget and soon perhaps SALT , he presses a foreign agreement upon a divided home front . Sometimes , notably with human rights , he injects an American imperative into delicate foreign situations . Sometimes , Camp David style , he shuttles desperately among deadlocked foreign contenders . Always the nation 's global standing as well as his Presidency are put at risk , and even calculated risks will yield a dramatic failure or two . But the more Mr. Carter succeeds , the more he may teach Americans that demonstrations of strength and vision in the world can turn on something other than military action . This is not our idea of model diplomacy . Indeed , American tactical errors contributed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months . But the major difficulty in recent weeks was the collapse of the Shah in Iran , which caused Israel and all Arab governments to reassess their relations with the United States and with each other . And amid the clamor at home that he not just stand there but " do something , " Mr. Carter thought his way-to the right thing to do : buy , beg and burrow ahead to a reassertion of American influence in the Middle East by the only route available ? entente among Egypt , Israel and Saudi Arabia . The prospects for a treaty are bright again , but the deal will not have been sealed when Mr. Carter descends upon Cairo and Jerusalem . Now that the Israelis are crowing about how stubbornness won them vital concessions , it will take great skill to keep the Egyptians from digging in on other points . But the Middle East today is not a region in danger of foreign conquest ; its governments are looking to see who is the most profitable friend , who pays the most , who pays court best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ count for more than cruising fighter planes or aircraft carriers . Mr. Carter is likely to succeed because his journey dramatizes his message . He will be acting out the dependence of the United States on friendly regimes that are obviously worried about their dependence on an eroding American influence in the area . He will be daring them to risk a further injury to American prestige by setting their separate interests above their common interests with the United States . He is betting that they can not turn him away empty-handed . The President also has his own political imperatives . The failure of the Camp David accords would be a costly personal defeat at a time of doubt about his leadership . If he must fail , this extraordinary journey will at least prove that he flew the extra mile . For Americans generally , however , ' the issues of the present diplomatic debate are more important than the personalities . What needs to prevail , when things go wrong abroad , is not the cry to do something to parade our might and frustration but the idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idea Mr. Carter takes to the brink this week .
