txt The system of corruption now thriving within New York City 's construction industry has been nurtured over the years by a network of fraternal relationships , economic , fear and political power that has easily withstood the traditional tactics of government investigators , There have been few arrests and even fewer jail sentences . And many of those who have , tried to fight the graft by themselves have been victims of retaliation . Robert K. Ruskin , the city 's Commissioner of Investigation , can count only 17 inspectors arrested , eight of them in the Buildings Department , since the end of 1968 . Most receive suspended sentences after pleading guilty to lesser charges . Mr. Ruskin and the District Attorneys have concentrated on prosecuting inspectors , not contractors , a strategy that is questioned by Whitman Knapp , the Wall Street lawyer who is chairman of the commission investigating police corruption , and who has been nominated to a Federal judgeship by President Nixon , " You need hard-nosed prosecution of the people who pay the money , " Mr. Knapp declared in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guys who are giving this money are powerful people in this community . If they faced the possibility of going to jail , they 'd use their political muscle to see that things got cleaned up . But their political power also protects them . Commissioner Ruskin rejects the suggestion that he should concentrate on the givers . " If you arrest a contractor , " he said , " it looks as if you 're protecting the city . " Builders , architects and union officials , who provided information on graft during a six-week investigation by The New York Times into corruption estimated to cost $25-million a year , also described a deeply ingrained system of sanctions that make corruption easy and bring trouble for anyone who resists it , In the painters ' union , for example  --  District Council No. // 9 of the International Brother . hood of Painters and Allied Trades  --  a crisis has erupted over allegations of dishonesty , Frank Schonfeld , the union 's secretary-treasurer , has charged that union business agents are overlooking clear violations of the contract . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay union members less than the union wage and some pay on a piecework basis , which produces shoddy work that is approved by inspectors for the City Housing Authority and the Board of Education , The main difficulty , Mr. Schonfeld believes , is that the city 's painters ' union is really an assortment of 20 locals , each of which elects its own autonomous business agent . " I have reason to believe that this present system encourages a corrupt relationship , " he says . Mr. Schonfeld has long been known as a reformer , having defeated his predecessor , Martin Rarback , for re-election in 1967 after Rarback was indicted on charges of taking $840,000 in bribes . But Mr. Schonfeld 's efforts to correct the current problems have backfired . Accuser Is Accused He asked one local to bring charges against its business agent , whom he accused of nag lecting his job . ' ' The local brought me up on charges instead , " Mr. Schonfeld said. , The district council 's execue tive board is now considering whether to expel Mr. Schonfeld @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar difficulties . One vice president of a large construction firm said that when he was in business for himself , until a year or so ago , his refusal to pay the police cost him about $1,000 a week in summonses . Not long ago , at the site of a tall office building going up on Manhattan 's East Side , he told a policeman that he would not pay , and the officer parked his patrol car in front of the construction ramp , preventing trucks from getting on or off the site . " Move your car , " the burly construction executive said he had ordered . The policeman refused , and the vice president described what happened next : " I told the steel guy , ' Why do n't you pick that car up with the crane and put it up on the seventh floor ? ' The cop said , ' You would n't dare  --  you 'll be in the can ' and I said , ' Yeah , right next to you ' " I said , ' See that public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dial 911 and report an unidentified car ? parked across my ramp , holding up my job , and when the cops come , I 'm going to make sure they write down that it 's a patrol car . And then I 'm going to District Attorney Frank Hogan 's office . What are you going to do to me ? You going to shoot me ? ' " He moved the car , but he said , ' You 'll hear from us ' We got summonses for dirt in the street and for a concrete truck dumping noxious materials into the sewer . The guy across the street did the same thing and got no violations . But we had the cleanest block in the city . " Harassment in Harlem Cora Walker , a Harlem lawyer , contends that she is still suffering from a battle she waged against corrupt Buildings Department inspectors 10 years ago , when she renovated her law office at 270 Lenox Avenue . " The inspector ordered the floor raised seven inches , " she said , " then he wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The carpenter says , ' Unless you pay him , you 're going to keep going back and forth . ' " So she taped a conversation with the inspector , who was discharged and arrested . But other Buidings Department personnel have long memories , she says . For four years , she has been unable to get a permanent certificate of occupancy for the Harlem Co-Op Supermarket , which she organized at 2555 Seventh Avenue . The only reason for the denial shown in Buildings Department records is that " contrary to ap ? proved plan N.B. 23.65 several proposed stores have been con. bined into one store to creatc this supermarket . " One department official conceded that the reason seemed ' ' trivial . " She is contends that he is also having trouble . " The architect says every time he goes down there , they ask , ' Is this for Cora Walker ? ' They are really pulling the book on it . Nobody in their right mind who 's in the construction business could buck the system . They 'd be out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' lesson recently on the futility of trying to buck the system . For $650 , he had hired an expediter  --  a middleman who deals with city agencies ? and had won the Building Department 's approval of a set of plans for the expansion of a restaurant into an adjacent building . Then he realized that since he intended to cut two doors in the wall between the buildings , he would have to get an approval on the original building 's plans as well . He decided to avoid an expediter and submit those blueprints himself , figuring that since the common wall with its new doors had already been passed on the first set of plans , the identical wall would be approved automatically . ' I Got Kicked Around ' Although he ended up with the same plan examiner who had approved the wall the first time , " I got kicked around . " the architect recalled . " The examiner said , ' Oh , this is illegal , you ca n't do this ; you need two fire doors here . ' I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later and called my expediter , who had the approval two days later from the same examiner . None of the objections were raised . " It cost a fee of $225 , he said . Examiners and expediters mingle freely in dreary offices on the 20th floor of the Municipal Building in Manhattan , on the eighth floor of the Municipal Building in Brooklyn and in other borough headquarters of the Buildings Department where plans must be presented . On the walls , huge signs read : " BRIBERY IS A CRIME  --  A person who gives or offers a bribe to any employe of the City of New York or an employe who takes or solicits a bribe , is guilty of a felony punishable by imprisonment for a term of seven years and by a fine. ? Penal Law , Article 200 . " In one of the offices , someone had written on one of the signs , " It 's only a crime when you get caught . " Signs Do n't Halt Graft Buildings Commissioner Joseph Stein had the signs posted shortly after he took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little effect on at least one expediter , who said he merely pays less openly now than before . At one time he could drop a bill into the open drawer of an examiner 's desk , he explained . " Now I say , ' See you later , then catch him walking in the hall or going to the bathroom . " When the examiner knows the expediter , he gives him credit , in effect , by performing the service now on the promise of payment later . This expediter admitted that without the graft , he would be out of business . The service he had to sell , he said , was prompt approval of building plans ; he maintained that he could not accomplish that with out paying bribes . His technioue depends on getting the plans assigned to one of several examiners , he , explained , and to do so he slips a $5 or a $10 bill to the clerk behind one of the windows at the Building Department 's plan desk . " I try to stick to somebody I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to break in anyone new . " Then he usually pays the examiner $20 to $50 , he said , to look at the plans , promptly and to avoid raising the petty objections that can delay or kill a project . But he contended that he was never able to get an examiner to ignore a substantial violation . " It 's like going into a crowded restaurant and you want a seat , " the expediter said . " That 's not saying the food 's going to be better . " For example , he had handled a brownstone renovation on Manhattan 's West Side , and when the work was complete , the Buildings Department inspector raised numerous objections that threatened to delay the issuance of the certificate of occupancy for the building . Without that certificate , which permits the use of the structure , the owner risked losing a prospective buyer for the brownstone . The inspector 's objections were substantial , including such items as improper ventilation of the boiler room and a stairway built so people would bump their heads . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to grant a " c. of o. " or " c.o. , " as the certificate is called , on the basis of a written statement that the violations would be corrected , In the hallway on the 20th floor of the Municipal Building , he slipped the official a ' sum of money that included two $5U bills . In another instance , the expediter said he had submitted plans for the renovation of a major restaurant in Queens , but was too busy elsewhere to make the normally required personal appearance at the borough office to hear the examiner 's objections to the blueprints . " The examiner helped me out , " the expediter recalled . " He gave the objections over the phone , which they rarely do . Next time I was out there I offered him $30 . The examiner said , ' This is n't quite enough for what I did , ' so I gave him another $20 to make it $50 . " How to Pay Slyly Sitting in the loft office of a Manhattan architect , the expediter demonstrated one way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a 10-by-12 inch manila envelope  --  and gripped it with one hand cupped over the edge . A bill would be tucked invisibly beneath the palm , he said . Then , with the hand-held edge of the folder facing away from him , he stretched his arm across the desk as if to give the folder to an examiner . The official would take it by cupping his hand over the expediter 's , he explained , then flip the , folder ever so the bill was on the bottom , finally using his other hand to slide the money from beneath the folder into a pocket or a drawer , The plan folder on which the expediter did his demonstration was the product of another bit of graft . It was actually the property of the Buildings Department , and it bore the printed admonition : " Warning , any person who removes these plans ... will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law. - Nevertheless , many architects remove the plans with impunity and keep them as insurance that building owners will pay them their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folder , which contains master blueprints for approved alterations , the owner can not get a certificate of occupancy . The expediter said he often paid a clerk at the plan desk a $5 bribe to give him the folder without making him sign for it . An Insulated System Some prestigious architecture firms whose own employes act as expediters contend that they can get plans processed with-1 out the payoffs . But others confess that they are not really sure whether or not they are paying bribes through their expediters . As a result , they find the system very seductive . This insulation of the givers from the takers , the diffusion of responsibility for the bribery , typifies most aspects of the building industry , and it gives the system of graft an added resilience . While some high officials of large construction firme keep close tabs on " gratuities , " others are not certain how much and to whom bribes are being paid from their coffers . One executive of a moderately sized general contracting company said he normally gave his construction superintendent , who oversees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several thousand dollars in cash at the begining of each job . " The home office does n't want an accounting of it , " the official said , " If he can pocket some of it , that 's his business . " Some executives prefer to negotiate directly with inspectors themselves , then let their subordinates actually pass the money , A subcontractor , having spent two hours with a reporter detailing the amounts his company paid to various inspectors and policemen , finally said proudly , " Of course , I never handed an inspector a dime . " He would do the negotiations , he said , then place the agreed amount of cash into a white envelope , seal it with Scotch Tape and turn it over to his foreman , who would pass it on to the inspector . One architect even admitted to a double standard about graft . When he renovated his own brownstone , he refused to pay the Buildings Department inspector , suffering through long delays before being granted a certificate of occupancy . But later , during the renovation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and since this time he was working professionally , he handed the inspector an envelope containing $50 . " It 's really insidious , " the architect said . " We ? all turn out to be crooks . " But most construction men do n't see themselves that way . They and the Buildings Department inspectors , who are required to have nine years of experience in the building trades before going to work for the city , come out of the same milieu in which they learn the same system , cultivate longterm relationships and form important allegiances . In Other Cities , Too To many builders , bribery seems no worse than a fine or a ' huge permit fee legally charged by the city . The Sanitation Department , for example , levies a fee of one-third cent per cubic foot of a new building , ostensibly to cover the builder 's use of a city dump . But most builders ' say they do n't use the dumps , and they observe that the fee can run $30,000 to $40,000 on a skyscraper ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Many simply accept corruption in New York as worse than their experience tells them exists in other . cities . In some cities upstate and in the South , one superintendent observed , a builder can buy an insurance policy . or a performance bond from a prominent politician and remain free of trouble from inspectors . Frank Schonfeld , official of painters union , has seen his efforts as a reformer backfire . He faces possible expulsion . And elsewhere , such as some Connecticut towns , there are no payoffs at all . One builder doing some work in Stamford said the police there enforced the laws strictly . As a result , he said , as trucks cross the sidewalk , " We have a man standing there with a broom and a hose . ' " The importance of government corruption here . is also diminished for many builders by the extent of union .. corruption , " How can I mind giving $50 to an inspector when I 'm paying a shop steward , for doling nothing ? " , one executive ' eked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it buys only efficiency and does not allow them to break important Jaws . The Buildings Department has at least one recent case on record that casts doubt on that assertion , however . A plan examiner , who has fled to Canada , was approving plans on jobs where he was also working as a contractor , the department said . He allegedly approved blue- , prints with zoning violations , ' too few fire exits and inadequate fire protection in stairway shafts . And he permitted alterations to Greenwich Village buildings that had been designated landmarks . Inspectors Held Responsible William J. Glinsman , president of the inspectors ' union , observes that this brand of corruption leaves such a visible trail that most inspectors  --  as well as architects and contractors who value their repu- , tations  --  would be.foolish to in- ' dulge in , it , " Once he signs that c. of a. , " Mr. Glinsman said of the inspector , " that 's a monument there . " And the reprisals are swift . An elevator inspector , for instance , was dimissed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a defective elevator that the inspector had checked and found satisfactory just hours before . Inspectors Hold the Power It is not the intricacy of the 843-page Building Code that-en courages corruption , most architects and contractors believe , but its erratic enforcement  --  aM administrative problem thathas , permitted a capricious atmos- ' pliere to develop as interpretations vary from examiner to examiner , from inspector to inspector . Commissioner Stein has taken ' some administrative steps tol combat graft . He has set up a special phone number  --  267-0261 ? where builders can call to complain about attempted shakedowns . Not many call ' , even though they are promised protection from reprisals . " Commissioners come , com- , missioners go , inspectors go on until pension , " one builder remarked . Since Mayor Lindsay took office in 1966 , five differ. ; ent men have occupied the Buildings Commissioner 's office .. , Mr. Stein has also changed rules to allow a builder 's own architect or engineer to make some inspections , such as checking the bedrock beneath footings for skyscrapers . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $20 for each footing , adding up to as much as $600 . But the Commissioner resists'e. pressure to remove inspectors , ' . from other phases , citing theicollapse of an apartment house ? ' lunder construction in Boston ire : , January , 1971 , with the death lof four workmen . The builder's. engineers had signed an affidavit certifying the building 's .. 1 " safety . " I He points also to a recent . case of ari apartment house ' , ' being erected in Manhattan : : , A building inspector noticed ; ( cracks in a column and called , ! , the builder 's engineer , who as- ' sured him it was safe . The : : Buildings Department insisted ; on a test , however , and wheiM heavy masonry block was load ; ed onto the floor , part of ' it , collapsed : " The .
