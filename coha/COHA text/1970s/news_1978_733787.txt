txt There are indications that the leaders of the East-bloc countries are devoting increasing thought to what will happen after Soviet President Leonid Brezhnev leaves the political scene . The concern of countries like Poland and Hungary is that moderation in the Kremlin , however relative , be preserved and that East bloc members like them should encourage or contribute to such moderation . As one liberal member of some standing in the Polish party put it : " It is important indeed that the next big brother ' is not less moderate . For us that would be something . " According to some well-qualified sources here , speculation on what will happen " after Brezhnev " figured in a recent Warsaw visit by Hungary 's Janos Kadar . // From ? a ? e 1 East bloc envisions next big brother ' Mr. Kadar is recognized as East Europe 's most practical liberal figure , one who is able to point to tangible results and broad public acceptance where the dogmatists elsewhere have signally faded .

Romania 's dual policy Romania has frequently adopted foreign policies independent of , and sometimes contrary , to those of Mr. Brezhnev ? and has minimized the risks of this by remaining severely orthodox and conservative at home . But neither internal relaxation nor a partially independent foreign policy from within the bloc would have been thinkable under Stalin . The " liberals " aver that some easing of hard-line policy has at least been possible under Mr. Brezhnev .

Technocrats may want only limited economic reform . To many others , however , making things work better means reforming the system , and the party as well , opening it up , for example , to minority opinion as the Yugoslays ' new statute has just done .
