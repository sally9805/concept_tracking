IN much of the land it seems a time to forget , and even to forgive . People still speak of the dog days , as they did in more innocent years when the " long hot summer " had not yet assumed ominous overtones . Always barring some sudden eruption , the U.S. is once again in an estival moment of lassitude and languishing spirits . Classic enmities and provincial disputes seem to blur in the sweltering July sun . Pitcher Denny McLain is back in Tiger Stadium . Richard Nixon played host last week to a reunion of his Whittier College class of ' 34 . Leigh Steinberg , the moderate new student-body president at protest-prone Berkeley , said he opposes the Viet Nam War but that most of his fellows are " sick of confrontation . " The Columbia News , a rural Georgia weekly , observed : " As long as there have been sweaty , hot summers , there have been cases of the blahs .

As it turns out , Agnew has good reason to project a new image of mellowness . TIME Correspondent Hays Gorey , who has traveled widely around the U.S. in recent weeks , concludes that in many parts of the country even conservative Republicans , including numerous candidates who acknowledge that Agnew is a fantastically successful party fund raiser , openly express their view that any further extension of the Agnew polemics will hurt the party rather than help it . " There is now a widespread feeling , " Gorey reports , " that no one is all right and no one all wrong .
