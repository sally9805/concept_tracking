txt Israelis as a whole are facing stoically the staggering economic burdens which ( as they see it ) are part of the price of survival . There were some isolated protests immediately after November 's devaluation of the Israeli pound , reducing it in value overnight from 24 to 17 cents . But the sober way in which the government has presented the case for the belt-tightening needed to keep Israel going has now won broad acceptance . The government 's case has been further strengthened by the way in which it has since stood its ground in the face of pleading from special interests , Basically Israel finds itself caught between two millstones : paying for the cost of the October war of 1973 ( put at some $7 billion ? at the then exchange rate ? by Finance Minister Yehoshua Rabinowitz ) and paying to equip itself in case of a possible new war ( for which , according to Mr. Rabinowitz , defense imports cost $2billion in 1974 and will cost $2.5 billion in 1975 ) .

Even in the still friendly United States , economic and political pressures are putting curbs on foreign aid . ? The desire of world Jewry to continue to help Israel is inhibited ( when it comes to cash contributions ) by the increase of the cost of living in virtually every other country .

Immediately after the war of 1973 , the United States allocated Israel $2,2 billion in emergency aid . Of this total , $1.5 billion is an outright grant that does not have to be paid back . For the next two to three years , Israel is counting on a further $1.5 billion ; and ( an Israeli Finance Ministry official said ) then President Richard M. Nixon tacitly agreed that this would be forthcoming when he visited Israel last summer . The foreign-aid bill signed by President Ford Dec. 30 included an item of $625 million for further economic and military aid to Israel . Of this , $300 million is earmarked for military credits , one-third of which will not have to be paid back . A target has not yet been set for this year 's private aid from abroad ?
