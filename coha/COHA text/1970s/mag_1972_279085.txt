The row that erupted last week , virtually on the eve of the XX Olympiad in Munich , was potentially the most disruptive in the troubled 76-year history of the modern Games . The governments of eleven Black African nations , notably Kenya , Ethiopia and Uganda , declared that they would not permit their countrymen to compete if the Games remained open to athletes from white-supremacist Rhodesia . <P> Threatened or actual boycotts are not new to the Olympic Games . U.S. participation in the 1936 Berlin Games was in doubt for months as many Americans urged a boycott to protest the anti-Semitism of the Nazi hosts . In 1956 Egypt , Iraq and Lebanon withdrew from the Melbourne Games because of the British-French occupation of Suez ; that same year Spain and Holland refused to compete because of Russia 's invasion of Hungary . Threatened withdrawal by Black African nations from the 1968 Mexico City Games resulted in the exclusion of black athletes from racist South Africa . <P> The situation last week differed from the 1968 dispute in that the consequences of a Black African @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1968 Games , Black African athletes were not regarded as a major factor in international competition . But Kenya , in particular , emerged in Mexico as a world superpower in men 's track events , winning more medals than any other nation except the U.S. This year the Kenyan team looks even stronger , with budding new stars to support defending Olympic Champions Kipchoge Keino ( in the 1.500-meter run ) , Naftali Temu ( in the 10,000 meters ) and Amos Biwott ( in the 3,000-meter steeplechase ) . Ethiopia too has potential gold medalists in defending Marathon Champion Mamo Wold and Miruz Yifter , a specialist in the 5,000-and 10,000-meter runs . In short , if Black Africa is absent , some of the medals awarded at Munich will seem slightly tarnished . <P> The potential long-term consequences are even worse . Overreacting to the threat with characteristic irritability , International Olympic Committee President Avery Brundage made a threat of his own : if any teams obeyed their governments ' orders to withdraw from Munich they would be expelled from future Games . Brundage rationalized his warning by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their governments . Brundage was being unfairly selective in issuing his threat ; he has never chosen to enforce the rule against Communist teams , which are clearly under their governments ' control .
