txt The rain-drenched Kennedy International Airport took on a strangely muffled sound as a sharply reduced number of planes got off the runway . The response to the International Federation of Air Line Pilots Associations ( IFALPA ) for a global 24-hour air-traffic stoppage appeared to have a noticeable effect on certain international flights , but was proving less disruptive for American domestic flights . Three domestic and 19 foreign airlines suspended flights in the United States in the wake of the IFALPA strike . The pilots hoped their action would force governments to adopt more stringent measures against air hijacking . Despite a federal injunction against U.S. participation in the strike , Eastern Air Lines in Miami , Northeast Airlines in Boston , and , Southern Airlines in Atlanta announced suspension of all Monday fights . Southern 's sus- UPI photo pension was lifted by midmorning . // *The day the pilots stopped // At Kennedy , some air terminals looked as gloomy as the weather outside , with so few waiting passengers that they resembled convention halls long after the delegates had left . " Say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Carey bus driver bellowed out to a guard as his bus rolled past the largely deserted car park and came to a stop outside the BOAC-Air Canada-Jamaica terminal . " Ai n't nothin ' here , " shot back the laconic reply . Ironically , BOAC was one of very few international airlines in service Monday . A morning spot check at such major airline terminals as KLM Royal Dutch Airlines , Iberia , Aer Lingus , Air France , Swissair , Scandinavian Airlines System ( SAS ) , Air India , Lufthansa and Sabena Belgium World Airlines revealed that business was anything but as usual . Not an item of baggage was presented , not a ticket was taken as empty-handed skycaps waiting out the day and bored ticket agents had only themselves to talk to . One traveler , crushed at the news he was unable to fly Air France that day to Bogota , was told cheerily , " You can go home , take sleep , and have a nice rest . " Ironically it was American pilots , who were the first to press for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air . The court roder obviously had results . TWA , Pan Am , and United flicked a full schedule of flights on Kennedy 's televised arrival and departure boards . Apart from the three " rebel " American airlines , most other domestic flights were scheduled as usual . Airport on ' vacation ' Nevertheless , with most international airlines out of action and many apprehensive passengers switching to Sunday-night bookings , Kennedy airport looked as if it had taken a vacation . A lonely Avis rent-a-car attendent said , " It 's 10:30 a.m. , and I have n't had a single customer . " What the airlines strike showed was a remarkable degree of solidarity among international pilots , at least as observed at Kennedy airport . A representative for Icelandic Airlines summed up the situation for his striking colleagues : " We have never had any trouble , but our crews are very sympathetic . " They do n't want any nut coming aboard with a gun and putting their lives on the line . There was obvious disappointment among striking airline personnel that a court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is disgusting that Pan Am is flying . They lost two planes through hijacking , " was one embittered response . Worldwide situation Here in brief was the situation in airports around the world shortly after the strike began : ? Israel : 450 pilots from Israel 's National Airline , El Al , and the internal line Arkia , plus 500 aviation workers , stayed off the job , closing Lod International Airport , scene of two recent terror attacks . ? Johannesburg , South Africa : All international flights by South African Airways were canceled , but domestic flights were running on schedule . ? Berlin : Pan Am , the main civilian carrier for commercial jet service linking West Berlin with West German cities , flew as scheduled . ? Oslo : Some 1,500 pilots of SAS and the domestic Norwegian Airlines stopped work , and all scheduled flights were suspended . *Manila : The Philippines Airlines Pilots Association reversed an earlier decision to strike and said it would continue normal operations . ? Hong Kong : Alitalia , Lufthansa , and Air France flights were canceled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15 major airlines had canceled or delayed departures of flights . ? Montreal : CP Air , Northeast Airlines , and Eastern Airlines notified air traffic control that inbound and outbound traffic was canceled . Most flights at Canadian airports were canceled
