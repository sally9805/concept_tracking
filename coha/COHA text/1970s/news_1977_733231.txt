txt IT WAS A dismal Tuesday morning , and the ladies of Began were stamping ' letters in the meeting hall , of the Parkview Civic Association , 3647 W. 86th PI . The letters , signed by Southwest Side residents , were to Jimmy Carter , asking him " to honor our parental authority in recognizing our strong opposition to forced busing and race mixing programs . " " We have more than 7,000 letters . Closer to eight , " said Connie Schaefer , chairman of the Bogen Community Council . Close-up With Jeff Lyon The letters filled a plastic laundry basket and a wooden bushel basket and overflowed onto a table . Women in stretch pants and tennis shoes were sitOng at long lunchroom-style tables , stamping still more letters . They took the stamps from cigar boxes , licked them , and then stuck them onto an envelope with a rolling movement of the side of their hands , striking a blow for neighborhood schools and racial purity . These were women showing the effects of great concern . Deep lines cut off both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the school board has Ernie Banks selling their integration program ? " Connie Schaefer said . " I think that 's poor sportsmanship . It 's poor sportsmanship , paying a famous figure to sell something like that . " " He 's black . Maybe he believes in in ? tegration , " I said . Her eyes veered and she shot me a we-both know-better smirk . " Sure , " she said . HYSTERIA REIGNS here In Began . One reason is the school board 's approval of Supt. Joseph Hannon 's plan to let 240 black children transfer from two overcrowded black schools into six Bogan-area elementary schools . So far , only seven black youngsters have applied for the busing program . The other reason for hysteria is Hannon 's proposal to place all white Hogan High in the same district as largely-black Calumet High . " Only seven have signed up for busing , " Connie Schaefer said . " If they have to go to this trouble to have Ernie Banks sell it , then maybe people do n't // Bogan women fighting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary Cvack was there Tuesday morning . She Is a long-time leader in the fight to keep blacks out of Bogan , schools , a fight that dates hack to 1964 . ? " Skin traders , " Mary Cvack snorted of Hannon and Edward Welling , the school board 's desegregation plan man , agor . " They claim to be educators , but they 're skin traders . They deal only in white skins , black skins , and red skins , ' trading them from one area to another . . They do n't look at people as people . " - " Look at these figures , " a woman : named Delores Kantor insisted . " This is the first time these figures are nut . : There are 280,332 blacks in public ? schools south of Madison Street and only 78,020 whites . And these whites are to be the sacrificial lambs . There are more blacks on the South Side than in the rest of the state , and they want our little area of Bogan'to accept that ? " Mary Cvack spoke : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the sending end , but it 's being forced on the receiving end ? us . They say we 're unduly concerned about 240 kids , but our concern is that a little bit of integration is like being a little bit pregnant ? there ai n't no such thing . " " They do n't want to learn , " said Lorraine Block , chairman of Mothers for Neighborhood Schools , American Style . " It 's much easier to get paid for doin ' nothing . Let the educated blacks educate their own , and teach them how to be clean . " Another woman Joined in : " I know what poor is . I 'm still poor . My family had to live in a garage with eight children , but that did n't ' mean we threw garbage into the streets , or held a knife ? to someone 's throat . " Back to Mrs. Block : " I ca n't accept integration because of my heritage . . They have a totally different culture . They 're trying to put a culture in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putting a ' round peg into a square hole . You go : Into Africa , and you 'll see that every ? herd of animals there go together . Zebra , elephant . They do n't mix , because ? they ca n't mix . , " You know , " she said , " I 'd like to be a member of the Four Hundred . But because of my culture and heritage , I ca n't . " " Yeah . I 'd like my daughter to go to yacht clubs , and be a debutante , " said Marion DePeder . " I 'LL TELL YOU something else , " said Mrs. Block . " I did n't even teach my sons this , they learned ? it themselves . They had to play . sports against them . And , you know they 'd spit in my sons ' eyes when they bent down in football , and steal their trousers when they went for a swim . " And now they were driving their 7,000 Jimmy Carter letters to the post office , and talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And of how they 've written to heavy-duty realtors Harry Chaddick and Arthur Rubloff for help . Chaddick controls Ford City Shopping Plaza , and Rubloff Evergreen Plaza . " Chaddick wants to keep his shopping center , do n't he ? " ? one of the women was saying . " We sent him a letter saying we do n't want to have to shop there under armed guard . He and Rubloff can use their influence . They have lots of influence . You have to realize this is a two-pronged problem : schools and housing . People are n't going to play sociological games . " You want to grab these people and shout back as loud as they shout , about how you do n't withhold from people and make them live in rat-infested hell and offer their children a crack in the mouth instead of education , and then turn around and call them dirty , lazy , and dumb . BUT THEN YOU run into someone like Marge Sullivan . She is the Bogan woman who last week wore blackface to a board of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . " I asked her if she did n't think it was in bad taste , and she answered , " Did n't Al Jolson make a fortune off it ? " You encounter things like this and it makes you hope the integration plan does n't go through . Why inflict these people on the blacks ?
