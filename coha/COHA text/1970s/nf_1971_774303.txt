txt  | The Colt version of this lock-mechanism is shown at Figure 4 , where " a " is the hammer , " d " the trigger , " n " the rebound lever ( or " mainspring auxiliary " , in British parlance ) , " e " the mainspring , " f " the pawl , and " g " the cylinder latch-pin ; the cylinder-bolt is ( from this aspect ) concealed by " a " , and shown at Figure 5 , when dealing with that safety-device embodied in revolvers made after mid-1905 . In single-action fire , " a " is drawn back with the thumb , until the nose of " d " engages a bent at the toe of " a " ; this movement has , by engagement of " a " and " d " , drawn back the trigger " d " on its pivot , and raised the pawl " f " to rotate the cylinder . The tip of " n " is engaged in a notch on the inner side of the pawl " f @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " lifts the rebound lever " n " on its pivot , and compresses the mainspring " e " ; initial movement of " n " has caught the tail of the cylinderbolt , tipped the latter out of engagement with the cylinder lockingnotches , and permitted " f " to rotate the cylinder until the cylinder-bolt escapes from " n " , and re-bolts the cylinder with a chamber in line with the bore . Pressure on " d " releases " a " , which is pivoted smartly forward ( by action of the top limb of " e " ) to strike a cartridge ; on release of " d " , the mainspring " e " throws down the rebound lever " n " which ( being engaged in a component " f " that is pivoted on the trigger " d " ) returns the trigger " d " to its forward position . In this movement of the trigger " d " , its nose readily pushes by the spring-loaded hammer-catch , on the  | breast of " a " , and a surface on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hammer " a " , and pivots this slightly , backwards off the cartridges in the cylinder . Self-cocking operation follows the same general course , with the nose of " d " engaging the tip of the hammer-catch on " a " , to tilt the hammer backwards ( until it escapes the trigger , and falls ) as the trigger " d " is pressed back . As earlier mentioned , this lock-mechanism was introduced by the Colt Company in a six-shot " New Pocket " revolver , which was offered in three ? 32 centre-fire calibre chamberings , and with a choice of 21- , 3i- or 6-in. barrel lengths ; Serven appears satisfied that introduction occurred in 1895 , but it is noteworthy that A. C. Gould noticed this " latest product " of the Company , enthusiastically , with the 1894 edition of his book . In 1896 , a slightly heavier version ( with conventional Colt butt , where the " New Pocket " had a rounded handle ) appeared , and was sold as the " New Police " revolver visible in Plate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? 32 calibre centre-fire cartridge , named after it , and was offered in barrel lengths of 2i , 4 or 6 inches ; a target model was also available , from 1897 onwards . These ? 32 calibre arms were successful enough , but the Colt Company now also launched a heavy-calibre " New Service " revolver with the same mechanical features , which eventually proved to be one of their most successful swing-out cylinder arms , and which also saw extensive use during the First World War . With this weapon ( shown in Plate 2 ) , chamberings for the most powerful of centre-fire pistol cartridges were featured from the start , so that revolvers in ? 476 Eley , ' 455 Eley , ? 450 Eley , ? 45 Colt , ' 44 Russian , ? 44-40 WCF , ? 38-44 , ' 38-40 WCF , and ? 38 Special calibres were available during our period ; standard arms could be had with 4i- , 51 or 7 fin. barrels , but a " New Service Target " revolver ( with flat frame-top , hand-finished action , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) was only available as a 42-oz. pistol , with 7i-in. barrel . The latter model , in and after 1901 , embodied adjustable sights of a type covered by the claims of J. J. Peard 's U.S. Patent No. 671609 earlier mentioned . Opinion as to the exact date of introduction for Colt " New Service " revolvers is divided , but most authorities appear to recognize that original model as appearing in 1897 ; certainly , the name " New Service " was registered as a Colt Company trade-mark , in America , during 1899 . It is noticeable , however , that arms with quite low serial-numbers carry a patent date of 1900 amongst their markings , to suggest that initial production was not large , if this model was really introduced in 1897 . Clearly , too , the " New Service Target " revolver appeared early  | in the series , even before Peard adjustable sights ( of 1901 ) were available for use with it . Markings on the early " New Pocket " , " New Police " and " New Service " revolvers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ date ( 5th August , 1884 ) of those two patents mentioned in respect of " New Navy " ( ' 89 Model ) arms , covering the principle of their ejectors ; the 1888 patent reference found upon " New Army " weapons was , for obvious reasons , not used , and no patent reference relevant to the new lock-mechanism appeared before 1900 . At 5th June , 1900 , however , Carl T. Ehbets and J. J. Peard secured U.S. Patent No. 650931 ( for improvements to such double-action lock-mechanisms ) , and thereafter that date also appeared upon the barrels of these arms . U.S. Patent No. 650931 claimed two methods for operating the cylinder-bolts of double-action revolvers . One method was applicable to arms with lock-mechanisms of the Warnant type ( as used in French Model 1892 service revolvers , described in Chapter II ) , where the lower limb of a V-shaped mainspring formed the hammer-rebound , and it was proposed to use a projection upon that limb , to rock the cylinderbolt from engagement with the cylinder locking-notches ; the other patented method employed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Fig. 4 ) to carry out such a task , and this was , of course , the device taken up by the Colt Company . In fact , it is doubtful if the Ehbet/Peard rebound-lever was actually used for " New Pocket " and " New Police " revolvers , although it was employed for the larger lock-mechanism of " New Service " arms ; thus Colt Company illustrated parts-lists , of post-1905 vintage , show rebound-levers for the smaller arms that are devoid of any " lever fly " , where such a component is clearly shown in spares lists for the " New Service " line . This " lever fly " was actually a small component , pivoted on the right sight of the rebound-lever , which operated the cylinderbolt , as the rebound-lever was lifted by the act of cocking the hammer . Experience proved that a cam-surface formed on the rebound-lever was effective , though not as smooth-working as the " lever fly " , and the fly was ultimately abandoned , even for " New Service " revolvers . Reference to the date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " lever fly " , was probably justified by a view that the cam-surface principle was also envisaged by the claims of that patent . In 1905 , manufacture of " New Pocket " and " New Police " revolvers ceased , but they were respectively replaced by " Pocket Positive " and " Police Positive " arms shown in Plate i ; originally , each differed from its parent only by the addition of a lock-mechanism improvement next to be described , but the " Police Positive " line was expanded consider-  | ably , in years prior to 1914 . Initially offered either as a standard arm ( with 4-in. barrel ) or target revolver ( with 6-in. barrel ) in ? 32 Colt or ? 32 Colt New Police chamberings only , target versions for the ? 22 Long Rifle rim-fire or ' 22 WRF cartridges were also available by 1911 , along with standard arms chambered for ? 38 Colt New Police or .38 S &W; cartridges ; around 1907 , too , a " Police Positive Special " standard revolver was also introduced , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centre-fire cartridges . This pistol had a frame and cylinder slightly longer than those same components in " Police Positive " arms , and it could be had in barrel lengths of 4 , 5 or 6 inches ; the weight-increase arising from this modification was slight , so that the " Police Positive " with 4-in. barrel weighed 20 oz. against 22 oz. for the equivalent " Police Positive Special " . This " Positive " name given by the Colt Company to its new models stemmed from U.S. Patent No. 793692 of 4th July , 1905 , which G. H. Tansley secured , and assigned to the Company . In England the equivalent protection was Br . Pat . 13680/1905 ( secured by O. IMRAY ; q.v. ) and similar patents were secured in other countries , but all protected the " Colt Positive Safety Lock " , which was embodied in both the new models , and in those " New Service " , " Army Special " , and " Officers ' Model Target " revolvers made in or subsequent to that year . A reference to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barrels of all the above-mentioned models , beside the patent dates of 1884 and 1900 , earlier described . Oddly enough , the Specifications to both Tansley 's and Imray 's patents of 1905 showed this " Colt Positive Safety Lock " as it could be applied to the obsolete Model 1894 Colt " New Army " double-action lock-mechanism , but , being perfectly adaptable to the now-favoured Schmidt-Galand design , the device was in fact never applied to late " New Army " ( and associated ) models . The " Colt Positive Safety Lock " is shown in Figure 5 , but should be studied in alliance with Figure 4 , showing the basic lock-mechanism to which that improvement was applied ; Figure 5 also illustrates the configuration of cylinder-bolt used in revolvers of post-1905 vintage , other than certain " New Service " arms earlier-mentioned , which still used the short cylinder-bolt and " lever fly " from the Ehbets/Peard patent of 1900 . In Figure 5 , " d " is the trigger , " h " the cylinder-bolt , " i " the safety , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Safety Lock " consists of " i " and " 1 " ( in conjunction with " d " ) , and has as its objective preventing the hammer of a revolver from accidentally striking a cartridge , unless the hammer has first been cocked ( by thumb or trigger-pressure ) and the trigger has been drawn to the rear literally as far as it will go .  | This " i " is an L-shaped component ( sliding in a slot milled in the right-hand wall of the pistol-frame ) , linked to the trigger " d " by a lever " 1 " which turns upon the same pivot as the hammer ; for clarity , the latter is omitted from Figure 5 . The short arm of " i " is a hammer-block , and extends across the front of the hammer to prevent it from reaching any cartridge , except when that hammer-block is aligned with a suitable notch cut across the breast of the hammer ; see Figure 4 . In fact , the only way in which such a juxtaposition can be effected is by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past that position at which it releases the hammer . In Figure 5 , it will be seen that pressure upon the trigger " d " will turn " 1 " upon its pivot , dragging " i " downwards in the frame , and eventually ( as the hammer is literally falling ) aligning the hammerblock on " i " with the notch in the hammer-breast , so that the firing-pin reaches a cartridge . Thus no inadvertent blow upon the hammer ( as by dropping a pistol ) , or slipping of the hammer from under the thumb in single-action fire , can in any conceivable way discharge the cartridge accidentally . Although such a point was not made in the Specifications either to Tansley 's or Imray 's patents for the " Colt Positive Safety Lock " , this contrivance also acts as a trigger- and hammer-lock when the cylinder is not properly latched home into the frame . In such an event ( as may be seen in Figure 5 ) , the cylinder-latch pin " a " is forced back into the frame-cavity , by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to block the downwards movement of the hammer-block ( on " i " , in Figure 5 ) if any attempt is made to cock the weapon . Altogether , this is an excellent safety-device , and deservedly successful from the date of its introduction . Serven teaches that it was embodied in " New Service " revolvers from serial-number 21000 onwards , and in " Pocket Positive " revolvers ( which were apparently numbered in sequence with their " New Pocket " predecessors ) at serial-numbers above 30000 ; the point of introduction for " Police Positive " arms is uncertain , but assumed to have occurred ab initio . The serial-numbers of these " Police Positive " revolvers are notably confusing , in any event , with considerable indication that the ? 22 target and " Positive Special " arms , for example , had their own separate serial-ranges . The next events of importance to the Colt Company , in relation to its swing-out cylinder revolvers , occurred in or shortly after 1908 , when the last two models relevant to our study were introduced , namely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Model Target " revolvers . The first was merely a replacement for the unsatisfactory " New Army " design ( by now in its Model 1903 incarnation ) , but embodying both the Schmidt-Galand lock-mechanism and improvements of 1900 and 1905 ; the second ( as its name suggests ) was a similar replacement for that old Model 1904 " Officers Model Target " version of the " New Army " design . Colt " Army Special " revolvers were initially offered in ? 32-20 , ? 38 Special and ? 41 Colt centre-fire chamberings , with barrel lengths of 4 , 41 , 5 , or 6 inches , at choice ; it was hoped to interest the U.S. Army in adopting this model , but ( with Philippine memories still comparatively fresh in official minds ) a calibre of less than ? 45 was unattractive , and no official interest was aroused . However , the " Army Special " line ( which was rechristened " Official Police " , a decade after the First World War ) sold well to police officers or marksmen , and its substantial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cartridges , also made it a superb platform for the construction of target revolvers ; a resultant " Officers Model Target " version had all those refinements earlier noted for " New Service Target " arms , and could be had ( with barrel lengths of 41 , 6 or 71 inches ) in ? 38 Colt , ? 38 Colt Special or ? 38 S &W; Special chamberings . Finally , the Colt Company ( which must have remarked , with some irritation , service purchases in 190I and 1902 of a Smith &; Wesson revolver later noticed ) were successful in securing orders for swing-out cylinder revolvers to replace or supplement those obsolete " New Army " ( and associated ) Colt arms in the hands of U.S. forces . The weapon selected was Colt 's " New Service " revolver ( see Plate 2 ) , in what is now  | called a " 1909 Army Model " version , and Lieut. - Col . R. C. Kuhn has recorded the following purchases as relevant to our period : 1st U.S. Army contract 1 oth February , 1909 ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1909 ? 500 revolvers 2nd U.S. Marine Corps contract 14th October , 1909  --  700 revolvers 2nd U.S. Army contract 16th December , 1909 ? 3,000 revolvers 3rd U.S. Army contract 3oth June , 1910 ? 2,000 revolvers 4th U.S. Army contract 8th December , 1910 ? 6,703 revolvers U.S. Navy contract 12th April , 191 I- 1,000 revolvers When war was declared by Great Britain , on 4th August , 1914 , Colt " New Service " pistols in ? 455 centre-fire calibre were available here from a number of retailers , and were privately purchased ( as was then the practice ) by many officer volunteers ; in years subsequent to 1914 , the purchase of such arms in quantity , by a British Purchasing Commission sent to the United States , was officially arranged , but it is not believed that any really significant operations of that type occurred in the last year relevant to this book . " COLUMBIAN " revolvers Although quite rare in Great Britain , two revolvers bearing the " Columbian " trade-name were marketed in America , and we have Mathews as formidable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made at a " Columbia Arsenal " , in Tennessee . It is noticeable , however , that such evidence as may be surveyed upon the point does not necessarily support that view for their origins . The " Columbian Double Action " revolver illustrated by Mathews was a ? 38 centre-fire solid-framed pistol , with chambers individually loaded or unloaded , which had no apparently patentable features , and was marked " New York Arms Co . " . MacFarland 's researches reveal that brand-name as one used by the Crescent Firearms Co. ( see below ) upon arms which it supplied for sale by Garnet Carter &; Co. , of Chattanooga , Tenn . The " Columbian New Safety Hammerless " revolver , on the other hand , seems principally to have been sold by Maltby , Henley &; Co. , a firm of New York jobbers later mentioned , and although also solidframed , it varied from the double-action " Columbian " arm in using patented design-features . These were the work of John T. Smith ( at Rockfall , Middlesex County , Conn. ) , another designer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of 24th January , 1888 ( U.S. Patent No. 376922 ) and 29th October , 18139 ( U.S. Patent No. 413975 ) , amongst their markings .  | In the first of these patents , Smith had proposed to mount his selfcocking lock-mechanism upon a butt-cum-trigger-guard component , and to hinge the latter to the barrel and shrouded-hammer lock-case of his revolver . By these means , access for repair or cleaning of the complete lock-mechanism could readily be obtained . In the second patent , both frame-construction and lock-mechanism were slightly refined , a wheel-shaped safety-device ( blocking the hammer , when suitably rotated ) was provided in the rear butt-strap , and a combined cylinderbolt and cocking-indicator was mounted in the top frame-strap . Such features were all embodied in " Columbian New Safety Hammerless " revolvers , and the composite frame-construction ( though solid enough ) did give these arms an external appearance of being hinged-frame selfejecting revolvers , in better quality than was actually the case . Alongside their ? 22 rim-fire and ? 32 or ? 38 centre-fire " Columbian New Safety Hammerless " line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house name ( see Plate 6 ) , and may also have sold the similar " Parker " or " Scott " weapons later described . There is no reason why that firm should not itself have arranged licensed manufacture of such arms under the Smith patents , but it does seem more logical to propose that Smith ( earlier connected with revolver-making , as mentioned below ) could actually have handled that end of the operation , and himself marked the weapons sold , with such " Columbian " or other legends , as his various customers required . " CRESCENT FIREARMS CO. " revolvers Research by Harold E. MacFarland has established the Crescent Firearms Co. , of Norwich , Conn. , to have been an important manufacturer of cheap firearms after 1892 , selling shot-guns , rifles and pistols ( either wholesale or by mail-order ) through a sales-outlet trading as the H. &; D. Folsom Arms Co. , of New York . Over ninety different brandnames were impressed upon Folsom arms ( although some thirty names appeared upon weapons actually purchased from Belgian , British or other American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplied for sale by large hardware companies trading in various parts of the United States , and never impressed upon weapons sold through the Folsom mail-order outlet . Although MacFarland does not refer to this matter , it seems probable that the Crescent Firearms Co. was actually launched by George W. Gilley , a former associate of the Hopkins &; Allen Manufacturing Co. ( sec below ) at Norwich , who purchased stocks and equipment valued at about $ 14,000 , from the moribund Bacon Manufacturing Co. of that tIWn , 111 1892.  | Mathews clearly identifies double-action self-ejecting revolvers as sold under the " Crescent " name ( which accounts for their mention here ) , but MacFarland 's more recent investigations suggest that such arms emanating from that source would more probably have been sold under brand-names like " Empire " , " Howard Arms " , or " New York Arms Co. " ( elsewhere mentioned ) , rather than by reference to their manufacturer 's name . MacFarland does list certain brand-names as used by the Crescent Firearms Co. upon its own products ( as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mail-order outlet ) , but this writer has not encountered revolvers marked with such names , save as elsewhere indicated in these pages . " EASTERN ARMS CO. " revolvers This name appeared upon cheap hinged-frame , self-ejecting revolvers ( with double-action or concealed-hammer self-cocking lock-mechanisms ) , of a type shown at Plates 3 or 4 ; five-shot , ? 32 centre-fire calibre arms , with 34-in. barrels , have been observed , and the source for these arms is suggested ( by Mathews ) as that Meriden Fire Arms Co. later discussed . " EMPIRE " or " EMPIRE STATE " revolvers As noticed by Mathews , five-shot " Empire State Hammerless " hinged-frame , self-cocking , self-ejecting revolvers ( with 31-in. barrels ) were offered , during our period , in ? 32 or ? 38 centre-fire calibres , and their manufacture ascribed by him to the Meriden Fire Arms Co. later mentioned . It should be pointed out , however , that MacFarland lists the Crescent Firearms Co. as users of the brand-name " Empire " , and also as suppliers of arms under the brand-names " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respectively to Sears , Roebuck &; Co. and J. H. Lau &; Co. for sale by them under such names . " FEDERAL ARMS CO. " revolvers These were inexpensive ? 32 and ? 38 calibre hinged-frame , double action revolvers and are also believed to have been made by the Meriden Fire Arms Co. ( q.v . ) . " THE FOEHL &; WEEKS FIRE ARMS MANUFACTURING CO " revolvers Charles Foehl was a Philadelphia gun-maker , who died in 1912 . Prior to years of concern here , his U.S. Patent No. 139461 of 3rd June , 1873 ( for an improved cylinder-rotation pawl ) had been briefly used by I. J. Clark , to manufacture small single-action revolvers sold under the  | trade-name " Deringer " . It is not definitely known if Foehl had operated from the Clark plant on Tamarind Street , Philadelphia , prior to its closure in 1879 . At about 1889 , The Foehl &; Weeks Fire Arms Manufacturing Co. was formed , in Philadelphia , and Foehl both secured and assigned to it his U.S. Patent No. 417672 , dated 17th December in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jointly secured U.S. Patent No. 444823 of loth January , 1891 , which they also assigned to the Company . The first patent related to a hammer-rebound for self-cocking , solid-frame revolvers , and the second to an arbor-latch and cylinder rotationdamper suitable for such arms . In fairly rapid succession , Foehl and Weeks thereafter jointly secured U.S. Patents Nos. 447219 ( of 24th February , 1891 ) , 468243 ( of 2nd February , 1892 ) , and 471112 ( of 22nd March , 1892 ) , which respectively claimed a firing-pin retractor and hammer-rebound for solidframed , self-cocking , concealed-hammer revolvers , another hammer rebound , and a barrel-latch for hinged-frame arms . The only Foehl &; Weeks revolver likely to be encountered today was apparently sold ( under the trade-name " Perfect " ) as a 5-shot ? 32 calibre , self-cocking , solid-frame weapon , with a concealed hammer , which acknowledged the above-mentioned date of U.S. Patent No. 447219 in its markings , but may have embodied other patented features . However , hingedframe pistols may also have been manufactured by this firm . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Co. existed for only a few years , since it is noticeable that Foehl 's later U.S. Patent No. 530759 of 11th December , 1894 ( in which he claimed a cylinder-retainer and cylinder-bolt for hinged-frame revolvers ) was not vested in the Company , but assigned , as to half , to one Henry Ruhland , of Philadelphia . At all events , Weeks appears to have left the scene at about this time , and Foehl thereafter to have engaged in other activities , until the occurrence of those events , later described , relating to KOLB revolvers . " FOREHAND " revolvers The " Forehand " trade-name was applied to revolvers made by a Forehand Arms Co. , at Worcester , Mass. , in years between 1890 and about 1902 ; however , it is convenient also to consider with such arms those made by Sullivan Forehand and Henry C. Wadsworth , who traded as Forehand &; Wadsworth , between 1871 and 1890 , using the Worcester plant and assets of their late father-in-law , Ethan Allen , who had been a noted revolver-maker until his death , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this firm is D  | uncertain , for some authorities place his retirement as early as 188o , and it is noticeable that assignments of patents relevant to partnership business were taken by Forehand alone from 1886 , a date well before that relevant in these pages . However , there seems no doubt that ( as U.S. Vice-Consul at Santos , Brazil ) Wadsworth died of yellow fever in 1892 , and that Forehand had reorganized the venture , as his own Forehand Arms Co. , less than two years earlier ; he did not long survive his partner ( dying at Worcester , on 7th June , 1888 ) and the business then passed to the Hopkins &; Allen Manufacturing Co. ( at Norwich , Conn. ) , whose activities are mentioned below . This transfer apparently occurred in 1900 , and use of the Forehand Arms Co. name was finally abandoned about two years later . In years prior to 1889 , Forehand &; Wadsworth had specialized in the manufacture of solid-frame revolvers , which were offered in a wide range of sizes . There were single-action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " , in ? 32 calibre , " The Bull Dog " , in ? 38 calibre , and " The Swamp Angel " , in ? 41 calibre ) , and ? 32 or ? 38 calibre double-action and self-cocking " Automatic Police " revolvers ( some of which had folding hammer-spurs ) , all of which continued to be available in years of concern here , and embodied minor features patented by Sullivan Forehand or the partners jointly , in years between 1871 and 1877 . It is likely , too , that such obsolete models as the double-action " British Bull Dog " and single-action " Army " revolvers ( of ? 44 calibre ) remained in wide use . When they turned to the manufacture of hinged-frame self-ejecting revolvers , it would appear that the partners envisaged production of a quite novel arm , since Forehand took assignment of J. C. Howe 's U.S. Patent No. 373893 ( of 29th November , 1887 ) for an unusual selfcocking design , which embodied both grip- and latch-safety devices , together with M. Bye 's U.S. Patent No. 375799 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hammer-lock for concealed-hammer revolvers . In the event , however , such hinged-frame revolvers as were actually produced in that period when the partnership name was impressed upon them were quite conventional in appearance , although use was made of ejector improvements patented by Howe , on 7th December , 1886 ( U.S. Patent No. 353948 ) and by Sullivan Forehand himself on 11th January , 1887 ( U.S. Patent No. 355761 ) , in such arms . For obvious reasons , " Forehand Arms Co. " revolvers differed little from their predecessors ( early models are frequently found with " FW " monogrammed grips ) , and were made in ? 32 or ? 38 calibre hinged- and solid-Game versions , with self cocking or double-action lock-mechanisms . The self-electing arms ( in barrel lengths of 3j or 5 inches ) acknowledged the Ilowe a ld forehand patents of ' 1886 and 1887 , earlier  | described , whilst solid-frame weapons were marked with the patent-date ( 2nd June , 1891 ) of H. M. Caldwell 's U.S. Patent No. 453421 , covering a pivoted arbor-latch used in them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , the Hopkins &; Allen Manufacturing Co. produced revolvers under the " Forehand " name after the Forehand Arms Co. had been absorbed , and " Forehand Model 1901 " or " Forehand Double Action " revolvers , for example , will both be found with the Norwich maker 's name and address impressed upon them . Indeed , an assignment of A. C. Wright 's U.S. Patent No. 615467 ( of 6th December , 1898 ) , covering a revolver cylinder-bolt , is actually recorded to the Forehand Arms Co. , and not to Hopkins &; Allen , although there is no clear evidence that the patent was worked by the new-comers . " FYRBERG " revolvers Andrew Fyrberg was a prolific patentee of improvements to revolvers , either alone or in association with others , in those years between 1886 and 1910 , but most of his ideas ( one or two of which must have been extremely valuable to those controlling them ) actually benefited others , rather than himself . Conveniently regarded , therefore , his career falls into two parts , namely , those years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disposal of others , and a period between 1900 and 1910 , when he endeavoured to work on his own account . In the first period , Fyrberg resided at Worcester , Mass. , and assignrnent of his patents ( or his joint securing of them with such men as Reinhard T. Torkelson , or Iver Johnson ) show his work benefiting either the Harrington &; Richardson Arms Co. ( as it then was ) , or Iver Johnson 's Arms &; Cycle Works , in respect of inventions later described in remarks upon those beneficiaries . In the second period , Fyrberg either promoted or participated in a firm called Andrew Fyrberg &; Co. , at Hopkinton , Mass. , which name appeared upon hinged-frame , self-ejecting pocket revolvers ( in ? 32 or ? 38 calibres ) similar in external appearance to those arms shown at Plate 4 ; such arms acknowledged the date ( 4th August , 1903 ) of Fyrberg 's U.S. Patent No. 735490 , covering a frame-latch and a cylinder-retainer used in them . The possibility that these revolvers were manufactured by others , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n years between 1907 and 1910 , Fyrberg secured U.S. patents covering " safi.ty " lock-mechanisms for double-action revolvers , and also revolver cartridge-ejection systems not based upon the use of a hinged frame ; weapons embodying the latter systems had cylinders either  | pivoted to the top of their solid frame , or turning diagonally to the bore-line , and this writer has not encountered specimen arms . " HARRINGTON &; RICHARDSON " revolvers In 1874 , Gilbert Henderson Harrington and William Augustus Richardson had begun to manufacture revolvers together , at Worcester , Mass. , and had branched into the production of shot-guns about six years later . Around 1888 , the Harrington &; Richardson Arms Co. was incorporated , and in 1894 transfer to a larger plant at Park Avenue commenced , an operation barely concluded in 1897 , when ( within a few months of each other ) the two founders died . The Company underwent a corporate reorganization around 1905 , but continued its operations most successfully through the remainder of our period , as it has continued to do to this day . Although some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their handguns were predominantly cheap single-action " Suicide Specials " , of a type later described ; however , shortly before incorporation of their Company , the partners signalled a real transfer of their attention to more sophisticated arms , by jointly securing U.S. Patent No. 360686 ( of 5th April , 1887 ) and by taking an assignment of H. M. Caldwell 's U.S. Patent No. 370926 of 4th October in the same year . These patented ideas were not ambitious , with the first protection relating to a " safety hammer " for use with double-action revolver lock-mechanisms , and the later patent to a cylinder-retainer for hinged-frame arms , and ( between 1888 and 1914 ) the Company subsequently took by assignment only about a dozen more patents in the revolver-field , but during that period the Harrington &; Richardson Arms Co. quite rapidly achieved a most important position within the industry . Indeed , by 1907 ( Sell records ) more than three million modestly-priced revolvers had left the Worcester plant , and there were few major countries in the world where such arms were unobtainable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American Double Action Revolver " , a solid-framed weapon quite similar in appearance to that shown as Plate 3 ( lower ) , which could be had in ? 38 ( five-shot ) or ? 32 ( six-shot ) rim- or centre-fire versions , and with barrel lengths of 22 , 41 or 6 inches . A variant was marketed as " The Safety Hammer Double Action " and lacked any hammer-spur to catch in the user 's pocket ; instead , the upper face and tip of what appeared to he a self-cocking hammer were roughened and concaved so that ( first starting the hammer rearwards , under gentle trigger-pressure ) the user could thumb-cock his pistol , if he wished to do so . This safety-hammer feature was the subject of ' U.S. Patent No.  | 360686 above-mentioned , and the line was so popular that ( in conventional or safety-hammer versions ) " Young America " , " Bull Dog " and " Vest Pocket " models , in ? 22 rim-fire and ? 32 rim- or centre-fire calibres , were added to it . At about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series of " Automatic Ejecting " revolvers , of that double-action hingedframe self-ejecting type shown at Plate 3 ( top ) , which could be had in six-shot ' 32 centre-fire ( 16 oz. ) or five-shot ? 38 centre-fire ( 15 oz. ) versions , with 34- , 4- , 5- or 6-in. barrels , and which acknowledged patent dates of 14th May , 1889 , 6th August , 1889 ; 2nd April , 1895 , and 7th April , 1896 . The first of those dates in fact related to the date for registration of that trade-mark ( a bullet-riddled target ) on the grips of each weapon , but the other dates respectively referred to H. M. Caldwell 's U.S. Patent No. 408457 ( for an improved pawl , mounted on the lifter ) , to A. Fyrberg 's U.S. Patent No. 536618 ( for the ejectormechanism ) , and to G. Harrington and W. A. Richardson 's U.S. Patent No. 557814 ( for a refinement to the ejector-mechanism ) ; one version of this model had a folding blade beneath the barrel , and is quite rare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of similar " Premier " double-action hinged-frame revolvers ( of the pattern shown at the top of Plate 3 ) in 7 X ' 22 rim-fire ( 13 oz. ) or 6 X ' 32 centre-fire ( 12 oz. ) models were also introduced , together with a short-barrelled " Bicycle " variant , and these also became very popular . The weapons acknowledged only one patent date , that of 8th October , 1895 , which related to F. Smith 's U.S. Patent No. 547525 covering an ejector-mechanism used in them . Although " Automatic Ejecting " , " Premier " and " Bicycle " models could all be had in a " Police " version ( embodying that safety-hammer above-described ) , there was a substantial demand for " Hammerless " revolvers ( i.e. concealed-hammer , self-cocking arms ) of the kind shown at Plate 4 , and the Company therefore met that demand with 13-OZ. 7 X ' 22 rim-fire or 5 X ' 32 centre-fire and 6 X ' 32 centre-fire ( 18 oz. ) or 5 X ? 38 centre-fire ( 17 oz. ) revolvers with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with 2- , 3- , 4- , 5- or 6-in. barrels , and the heavier arms in barrel lengths of 34 , 4 , 5 or 6 inches , and although they normally acknowledged only the 1895 date of Smith 's patent , it is believed that many embodied a frame-mounted firing-pin covered by W. A. Richardson 's U.S. Patent No. 552699 of 7th January , 1896 . Later , too , loading-gates were an optional extra for the solid-framed series ( under W. A. Richardson 's U.S. Patent No. 565692 of 11th August , 1896 ) , and " Model 1904 " ( Plate 3 ; lower ) , " Model 1905 " , and " Model 1906 " revolvers , barely distinguishable from each other but ,  | respectively , in 6 x ? 32 or 5 X ? 38 centre-fire ( i6 oz. ) , 5 X ? 32 centrefire ( II oz. ) , and 7 X ? 22 rim-fire ( io oz. ) versions , with barrel-lengths of 2 ? -0 41 or 6 inches were added to the solid-framed range . With a 6- or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frame did duty in " Trapper Model " and " Hunter Model " ? 22 rim-fire kit-guns , for sale to campers , hunters and trappers . As mentioned earlier , the Company secured ( by assignment ) only a dozen or so U.S. patents in our period , for improvements to revolvers , although it numbered such stalwarts as Homer Caldwell , Martin Bye , and Andrew Fyrberg , amongst its " stable " of patentees . Indeed , with those exceptions noted above , there is little evidence that the Company used ( or even needed to use ) these patented ideas to maintain its position as a leader in the production of inexpensive pocket arms . A lockmechanism barely distinguishable from that shown at Figure 32 ( but lacking , of course , the patented cylinder-bolt of J. CARTER ) served in almost all Harrington &; Richardson revolvers relevant to these pages , whatever patented refinements of detail might sometimes be added to it , from time to time . " HOOD " revolvers Freeman W. Hood ( whilst based in Norwich , Conn. , during the i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufacturers of cheap single-action solid-framed " Suicide Special " revolvers , of a type described below ; his Norwich operations had apparently ceased in 1881 or 1882 , but he is known to have secured a half-interest in A. F. Hood 's U.S. Patent No. 304731 ( of gth September , 1884 ) covering a cylinder-bolt used in double-action revolvers made by the American Arms Co. ( q.v . ) . Arthur F. Hood had himself assigned U.S. Patents Nos. 391612 and 391613 ( of 23rd October , 1888 ) respectively to the American Arms Co. ( q.v. ) and the John P. Lovell Arms Co. ( q.v. ) ; the former may have used the protected cylinder-bolt , or made such revolvers for sale by the inventor . " HOPKINS &; ALLEN " revolvers The Hopkins &; Allen Manufacturing Co. had been formed at Norwich , Conn. , in 1867 or 1868 , and later occupied a factory at 132 Franklin Street during the whole period in point here ; Samuel S. Hopkins , Charles W. Hopkins , and Charles H. Allen gave their names to that Company , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this circumstance eventually had unlbrtunate effects upon the fortunes of most participants . Thus Charles A. Converse had sold his share in the Company to Merwin , I Iullrrrt &; Co. ( a substantial firm of  | New York sporting-goods jobbers , later mentioned ) in 1874 , and the Hopkins &; Allen Manufacturing Co. had thereafter become overdependent upon that type of sales outlet ; not only had a large part of the Company 's output been sold through these particular jobbers , but revolvers to a design patented by that customer ( or others like it ) had been produced in quantity , and no real attempt made , as a result , to establish sales contact and a Company reputation with the public at large . As early as 188o , Merwin , Hulbert &; Co. had ( through the failure , for $1oo,000 of the Evans Repeating Rifle Co. ) slipped into serious financial difficulty themselves and involved the Norwich firm in that affair , but because of the New Yorkers ' share-holding in the Hopkins &; Allen Manufacturing Co. , this association and dependence was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; Co. ( as the New York firm had become ) failed completely , and could pay a dividend of only Io cents in the dollar on the debt of $90,000 due to their Norwich associates . Following that collapse , the Hopkins &; Allen Arms Co. was incorporated , in 1898 , and only then was an attempt made to sell the out-put of revolvers , shot-guns , rifles ( introduced in 1888 ) and bicycles ( a line belatedly attempted in the early 189os ) direct to the public , as well as to wholesalers . Regrettably , the Franklin Street factory was gutted by fire , on 4th February , 1900 , and irreplaceable sales lost in the time spent on re-equipment of it , so that although a takeover of the Forehand Arms Co. ( see above ) ensured the existence of some products to sell , the Company never regained that eminence which it had undoubtedly enjoyed prior to 1880 . Charles W. Hopkins died in 1914 , and although the Company did manufacture some rifles for the Belgian government , this was merely a prelude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rockwell Corporation , of New Haven , Conn. , and ultimate extinction . In addition to single-action revolvers of good quality , the Hopkins &; Allen Manufacturing Co. had commenced production of cheap singleaction solid-frame " Suicide Specials " almost from the date of formation , and those arms ( sold under such trade-names as " Blue Jacket " or " XL " ) remained a staple until just before the period in point here , when a decision was taken to introduce double-action revolvers in both solid- and hinged-frame models ; indeed these single-action arms were still catalogued by mail-order specialists like Hartley , Graham &; Co. ( at $ I or $1.25 each ) as late as 1900 , and the successor Company itself only ceased to catalogue parts for them in 1902 . The point is not entirely clear , but it is probable that an " XL  | Double Action " series were actually the first double-action Hopkins &; Allen revolvers , being solid-frame pocket arms , available in ? 22 rim-fire and ? 32 or ? 38 centre-fire calibres . These weapons had folding hammerspurs ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acknowledged patent dates , of 28th March , 1871 , and 5th January , 1886 , amongst their markings ; the first date recognized Samuel S. Hopkins 's U.S. Patent No. 113053 , covering their arbor , and the second J. Boland 's U.S. Patent No. 333725 , for use of a coiled pawl-spring , carried by the trigger in that fashion shown at Figure 6 . Oddly enough , those markings were not always extended to include reference either to Samuel S. Hopkins 's U.S. Patent No. 311323 of 27th January , 1885 ( for the folding hammer-spur ) or , upon the occasions when such a refinement was fitted , to his U.S. Patent No. 297801 of 29th April , 1884 , covering a combined arbor and spring-loaded ejector-rod . The case was similar for later solid-framed arms , like the " Universal Model Double Action " ( which was sold under a model-name related to the calibre as , for example , the ? 32 centre-fire " Double Action No. 6 " revolver ) , the " XL Bulldog " double-action series ( in ? 22 , ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folding hammer-spur , or the concealed-hammer self-cocking " Acme " model ; this latter arm ( manufacture of which ceased around 1903 ) was available in ? 22 or ? 32 versions , and had a safety-catch in the rear of the hammershroud . In a hinged-frame self-ejecting series , Hopkins &; Allen pistols were sold under the model-names " Automatic " ( ? 32 or ? 38 centre-fire ) and " Safety Police " ( ? 22 rim-fire , ? 32 or ? 38 centre-fire ) , which were of very sound quality for their price . The " Automatic " revolvers were available in both concealed-hammer ( self-cocking ) and double-action versions , the latter with the folding hammer-spur , if desired , and all used the spiral pawl-spring embedded in the trigger , as claimed by U.S. Patent No. 333725 earliermentioned . The lock-mechanism of the " hammerless " version ( which differed only in detail from that used for the double-action model ) is shown at Figure 6 , from which it will be seen that a hammer-rebound and safety-catch were fitted to such arms . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hopkins 's and J. Boland 's U.S. Patent No. 505569 ( of 26th September , 1893 ) , which also claimed the safety-device . The Hopkins &; Allen Arms Co . " Safety Police " revolver was possibly the best double-action self-ejecting pocket revolver of its day , and was matched in the ingenuity of its safety lock-mechanism only by an equivalent lver Johnson design later described , for it was genuinely  | impossible to fire this weapon by any accidental blow to the hammer , or mishap in cocking . Protected by John J. Murphy 's U.S. Patent No. 829o82 ( of 21St August , 1 go6 ) , which had been assigned to the Company , and the date of which was acknowledged upon these revolvers , the lock-mechanism was publicized as having a " Triple Action Safety " . Essentially , the design consisted in using a separate frame-mounted firing-pin and ensuring that the hammer could only strike that firing-pin when the trigger had been fully pressed to the rear . In any other circumstance , the hammer rested upon or struck only the frame . li , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the hammer , " B " the trigger , and " D " the safety-device ( shown rotated to block the hammer if the trigger is pulled ) , and " E " the hammer-rebound , which is forced up on its pivot by " B " ( via the trigger-spring ) to engage the rear of the hammer and force this back off the firing-pin . Note that the pawlspring is a coiled component , nested in the trigger at " d " , and bearing upon the lower end of the pawl " p " . Murphy accomplished this highly desirable feature by mounting the hammer rotatably upon a pivoting hammer-mount , which itself rocked eccentrically upon yet another axis fixed in the frame-wall . The effect of this eccentrically-hung hammer-mount was that mainspring-pressure on the hammer normally kept this hammer-mount on the upper position of its eccentric ( with the hammer-nose resting on the frame above the firing-pin , as a result ) , and full trigger-pressure was needed to rotate that hammer-mount down into a lower position where , on falling , the hammer turned thereon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and above this safety-feature , " Safety Police " revolvers had an unusual barrel-latch , in which wear was automatically taken up by engaging ( under spring-pressure ) wedge-shaped dogs with suitable frame-cuts , to accomplish the latching . In concluding these remarks upon Hopkins &; Allen revolvers , the reader 's attention is drawn to arms discussed under the names  | " Forehand " , " Imperial Arms Co . " , " Merwin &; Hulbert " , and " Thames Arms Co. " , which may all be considered as " Hopkins &; Allen " pistols , in a general sense . " HOWARD " revolvers The name " Howard Arms Co. " appeared upon ? 32 and ? 38 calibre centre-fire double-action hinged-frame self-ejecting pocket revolvers made in our period . Mathews ascribes these arms to the Meriden Firearms Co. ( see below ) , but MacFarland notices " Howard Arms Co. " as a brand-name used by the Crescent Firearms Co. above-mentioned , upon weapons supplied by it for sale by Messrs . Fred Biffar &; Co. , of Chicago , Ill . " IMPERIAL ARMS CO. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hammer ) was manufactured by the Hopkins &; Allen Arms Co. ( q.v. ) , but marked with the name Imperial Arms Co . As in the parallel cases of " Eastern " or " Howard " revolvers , for example , the sales outlet for these " Imperial " revolvers was presumably a large hardware firm in another part of the United States . " IVER JOHNSON " revolvers A partnership formed at Worcester , Mass. , in 1871 , between Iver Johnson and Martin Bye , had begun to manufacture single-action solidframe " Suicide Special " revolvers ( see below ) at 50 Central Street , in 1873 . The business was successful , but Bye sold his interest to Johnson ( in 1883 ) , and became associated with Sullivan Forehand , and later with the Harrington &; Richardson Arms Co. ( q.v. ) , although his inventions were never seriously developed by either recipient of them . Iver Johnson re-styled the Worcester business as " Iver Johnson 's Arms &; Cycle Works " , but moved his plant to Fitchburg , Mass. , in 1891 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death ( Sell reports ) all firearms were marketed exclusively through the John P. Lovell Arms Co. , of Boston ( q.v. ) , but this dependence was then wisely ended , and thereafter the firm sold to all comers . Iver Johnson 's son , Frederick I. Johnson , was deeply involved in the business after his father 's death , but the firm was apparently legally controlled ( during most of those years in point here ) by Mary Elizabeth Johnson , Iver Johnson 's widow , acting first as Executrice and subsequently as Trustee of her husband 's estate . By 191 4 , sales of " Iver Johnson " revolvers from the Fitchburg plant had become very large indeed ( as they continue to be , even today ) , but the Grm also sold excellent shot-guns in various qualities , together with  | stock blanks , wrenches , gun- and rifle-swivels , bicycles , and ( after 1910 ) a line of cheaper revolvers which were marketed under the trade-name U.S. Revolver Co . Even prior to 1889 , Iver Johnson marketed solid-framed double action revolvers ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Short ) in addition to his single-action arms , the last of the " Suicide Specials " , a " Defender ' 89 " model , not being dropped from his catalogues until 1895 . Further , a simultaneous-ejecting double-action solidframe weapon ( in which the cylinder swung out sideways , through 900 , on a vertical pivot ) had been briefly produced under the U.S. patents of Andrew Hyde , but manufacture was not continued into those years relevant here . Until 1900 , the principal solid-framed double-action Iver Johnson revolvers were the " Boston Bull Dog " and " American Bull Dog " arms ( resembling that comparable Harrington &; Richardson arm shown on Plate 3 , lower ) offered in a choice of rim- or centre-fire calibres , and in various barrel-lengths . These weapons had no patented features , but were highly successful . In 1900 , this series was lightly remodelled , and thereafter offered as the " Double Action Model 1900 " , in 7 X ? 22 , 5 X ? 32 rim-fire , or 5 X ? 32 , 6 x ? 32 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a octagonal barrel was standard , but 4 or 6-in. barrels available at extra cost . A 7 x ? 22 rim-fire " Target " version with 6- or 9.1-in. octagonal barrel was introduced at the same time , but all wholesalers and retailers were forbidden to describe these two models as " Iver Johnson " arms , since they lacked the patented safetydevice later described . A cheaper " U.S. Revolver Co. " version of the Model 1900 line was also marketed , with round barrel and unfluted cylinder and , for a comparatively short time , the firm later offered ( possibly as a competitor to the Kolb revolvers , described below ) a solid-framed concealed-hammer self-cocking " Petite " revolver , in ? 22 rim-fire calibre and with folding trigger ; this arm embodied a hammer rebound protected by T. F. Bowker 's U.S. Patent No. 898717 of 15th September , 1908 ( which had been assigned to Mary Elizabeth Johnson ) , but was never very popular . Undoubtedly , the best known and most successful Iver Johnson revolvers in our period were hinged-frame self-ejecting models ( in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which were , admittedly with certain detailed improvements , marketed for over fifty years before it was thought necessary to vary their basic lock-mechanism . Arms of that type shown on Plate 4 should he clearly distinguished , however , from " Swift " or " U.S. Revolver Co. " weapons quite similar in external appearance , which were also  | manufactured by this firm . The " Swift " weapon need not detain us here , since it is discussed in later remarks upon the John P. Lovell Arms Co. ( q.v. ) , and " U.S. Revolver Co. " arms are described at the conclusion of these remarks . A self-cocking Iver Johnson " Safety Hammerless " revolver shown at the top of Plate 4 bears patent dates of 6th April , 1886 , 15th February , 1887 , loth May , 1887 , and 26th December , 1893 ; it also bears the notation " Pats . Pending " , and may conveniently be discussed here ( by reference to those improvements covered by the relevant patents ) , as personifying hinged-frame arms first introduced at about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolver No. 463344 of this model , that Leon F. Czolgosz shot President McKinley , at Buffalo , on the 6th September , 1901 ; his victim died eight days later . The patent date of 6th April , 1886 , referred to U.S. Patent No. 339301 ( which was secured by Iver Johnson , R. T. Torkelson and A. Fyrberg , with the two latter patentees assigning their interest to Johnson ) , amongst the claims of which was one relating to the " safety trigger " used in these self-cocking models . This device is visible in Plate 4 ( top ) , as a component hinged into the upper part of the trigger ; it operated to bolt that component ( by fouling the rear bow of the trigger-guard ) unless the user first displaced it by applying deliberate finger-pressure to the trigger , in that fashion normal when firing . The patent date of 15th February , 1887 , related to J. C. Howe 's U.S. Patent No. 357710 , which claimed a method for retaining the cylinder upon its arbor ( when the pistol was broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cut around a small collar at the front of the cylinder , which had to be withdrawn through a female thread cut into the barrellug , before the cylinder could be removed . The patent date of loth May , 1887 , referred to U.S. Patent No. 362631 ( secured by Iver Johnson and A. Fyrberg , the latter assigning his interest to Johnson ) , which covered an ejector-mechanism used in these revolvers ; save that the version illustrated has a coiled spring , instead of a flat spring proposed by these patentees , the ejector shown in Figure 7 is the subject of this protection . The patent date of 26th December , 1893 , related to O. F. Mossberg 's and Iver Johnson 's U.S. Patent No. 511620 ( for which Mossberg assigned his interest to Johnson ) , which covered the rather complex barrel-latch visible in Plate 4 ; this latch was released by raising the small thumb-piece protruding on the left of the barrel-strap . The legend " Patents Pending " , stamped upon these revolvers almost certainly referred to then-pending U.S. patent applications which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( dated  | 16th June , 1896 ) and A. Fyrberg 's U.S. Patent No. 566393 ( dated 25th August , 1896 ) ; the first of these was assigned to Mary Elizabeth Johnson , and the second , presumably whilst still an application , to Iver Johnson himself . The earlier protection related to that detachable hammer-shroud visible in Plate 4 , and the later ( which was by far the most important ) to an ingenious safety lock-mechanism later described . Early double-action hinged-frame Iver Johnson " Safety Hammer " revolvers marketed with the self-cocking arms ( and of a pattern also shown on Plate 4 ) normally bore the dates of the above-mentioned U.S. Patents Nos. 339301 , 357710 , and ( once it had been granted ) of 566393 . However , reference to the date of the ejector patent ( No. 362631 ) was sometimes omitted from these markings , and the date 13th March , 1888 , will be encountered on all weapons fitted with the simple barrellatch visible in Plate 4 ( lower ) , which was covered by Iver Johnson 's and A. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnson ) , prior to introduction of the more complex latch covered by the Mossberg/Johnson patent of 1893 earlier described . As with self-cocking arms , such markings concluded with the notation " Pats . Pending " . Figure 7 shows the details of Iver Johnson double-action revolvers developed by the close of our period , but the reader 's attention is here specifically drawn to a safety feature embodied from the outset in that mechanism , which was the subject of Andrew Fyrberg 's U.S. Patent No. 566393 , which was vigorously promoted by the description of pistols embodying it as " Hammer the Hammer " revolvers ( because no accidental blow upon the hammer could possibly fire weapons embodying it ) , and which met a richly-deserved success for many years after 1914 . In Figure 7 " v " is the hammer , " w " the trigger , " x " the lifter , " y " the pawl , and " z " the sear ; it will be noticed that a separate framemounted firing-pin " a " is used , which the hammer can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lock-mechanism is to that French design ( described in Chapter II , and illustrated at Figure 15 ) , so that the hammer " v " is raised in self-cocking fire by pressure on " w " raising the lifter " x " , which is in turn engaged with a tooth on the breast of " v " . Eventually , the hammer escapes from " x " ( and can fall because " w " has pressed back the sear " z " ) , when the tip of " x " is aligned with the firing-pin and transmits the hammer-blow to it . When the trigger " w " is released , the trigger-spring forces it forward , drags the lifter " x " downwards to re-engage the tooth on the hammer , and so frees the firing-pin to retract into the frame , under pressure from a coiled spring . The sequence of single-action fire may be deduced from Figure 7 , and presence of ' the sear " z " .  | The lock-mechanism shown in Figure 7 actually embodies certain design-features available only at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to demonstrate ideas introduced by earlier models . As study of the cylinder locking-notches in Plate 4 will show , for example , the first arms had no separate cylinder-bolt , indexing chamber and bore instead by means of a lump on top of the trigger , which engaged the lockingnotches only when the trigger had been pulled sufficiently far to the figure rear . In Figure 7 is shown that positive cylinder-bolt " e " covered by the claims of O. W. Ringquist 's U.S. Patent No. 968691 ( of 3oth August , 1910 ) , which was assigned to Mary Elizabeth Johnson , who had earlier secured rights to R. T. Torkelson 's U.S. Patent No. 903919 ( of 17th November , 1908 ) for the self-retracting and readily removable firingpin " a " shown in Figure 7 . One other distinctive feature of later lockmechanisms was the use ( in place of flat springs ) of draw-tempered piano-wire springs , which were introduced under Frederick I. Johnson 's U.S. Patent No. 1004172 of 26th September , 1911 . It will be observed from Figure 7 , that tension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjusting-bar ( against which it works ) in a series of mounting-notches in the frame , and it would be interesting to know if ' the patentee was aware of Br . Pat 10072/1905 , by W. J. WI I I ' I ' I NG ( q.v. ) , when this U.S. protection was sought . Tut &; 0 . Ms '  | Although their hammer rested upon the frame below the firing pin , and not as shown in Figure 7 , the lock-mechanism of concealed-hammer self-cocking " Safety Hammerless " revolvers also operated as above described , and later arms embodied the same improvements as double action models . Some improvements to the " Hammerless " line were ones of omission rather than addition , with the separate hammershroud ( covered by U.S. Patent No. 561963 ) being discarded in favour of a one-piece frame , and the complex side-lever barrel-latch ( covered by U.S. Patent No. 511620 ) being dropped in favour of the type of latch shown upon the double-action arm in Plate 4 . By 1914 , these improved Iver Johnson hinged-frame revolvers had discarded the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marketed in six basic models , namely , the " Safety Hammer Automatic " , the " Special 32 Safety Hammer Automatic " , the " Safety Hammerless Automatic " , the " Special 32 Safety Hammerless Automatic " , and the " Safety Cycle Automatic " ( hammer and hammerless ) pistols ; " Special 32 " arms were six-chambered 19 oz. revolvers , with sufficient extra metal in them to handle ? 32 S &; W Long or Colt New Police cartridges , whilst the other models could be had in 7 X ' 22 rim-fire and 5 X ? 32 or 5 X ' 38 centre-fire versions , with the " Cycle " arms available only with 2-in. barrels . Hinged-frame " U.S. Revolver Co. " pistols have only been observed by this writer in a concealed-hammer self-cocking model , available in 5 X ' 32 or 5 X ? 38 centre-fire calibres with 3- or 34-in. barrel respectively ; introduced around 1910 , these arms had the one-piece hammershroud of later Iver Johnson " Safety Hammerless " revolvers , but lacked Fyrberg 's " Hammer The Hammer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coiled variety . An earlier Iver Johnson venture of this kind is noticed in later remarks upon " U.S. Arms Co. " revolvers . " KOLB " revolvers Following those events recorded in earlier remarks upon the Foehl &; Weeks Fire Arms Manufacturing Co. , Charles Foehl became associated with Henry M. Kolb , of Philadelphia , and was joint-applicant with the latter ( between 1902 and 1907 ) for U.S. Patents Nos. 702735 ; 818177 ; 826788 ; and 847011 ; the patents related to revolvers of a pattern ( like Colt arms earlier described ) in which the cylinder was swung outwards from the solid frame , on a crane , for loading or ejection of cartridges . There is no evidence that Foehl and Kolb achieved production for such arms , but Kolb was also involved in the manufacture of another type of revolver , which achieved a limited popularity prior to 1914 , and  | it may be that Foehl ( until his death , in 1912 ) was a party to this production . At any rate , Foehl 's last U.S. revolver patent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an automatic cartridge-ejector for solid-frame revolvers ( similar in effect to the devices of H. A. SILVER and W.

The " Kolb " solid-frame arms were self-cocking , concealed-hammer pocket weapons ( similar in external appearance to an Iver Johnson " Petite " revolver , earlier mentioned ) , which had 12-in. barrels , paired cylinder locking-notches , folding triggers , and could be purchased either as the 6 x .22 rim-fire pistol shown at Plate 8 ( lower ) , or as a 5 X ? 32 calibre centre-fire model , which is now quite rare . On 5th April , 1910 , Kolb took out two U.S. patents ( Nos. 954190 and 954191 ) , covering firing-pin and arbor-retainer improvements to such arms , which protection was recognized in a marking " Pats . Apr. 5. 10 . Model 1910 " found upon such weapons . U.S. patents of 24th May , 1910 , and 13th June , 1911 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Kolb for design-features applicable to hinged-frame arms ( similar in appearance to his solid-frame models ) , but although some authorities recognize such pistols as actually made by Kolb , this writer has not been fortunate enough to encounter specimens for description here . " LOVELL " revolvers As mentioned in remarks upon " Iver Johnson " revolvers , the Bostonbased John P. Lovell Arms Co. were exclusive distributors of such arms until around 1895 , and during the later years of this relationship manufacture of a " Swift " model revolver was also commenced by the Iver Johnson Arms &; Cycle Works , to a design dictated by that Boston company . After exclusive access to " Iver Johnson " arms had ended , production of the " Swift " model at Fitchburg , for the Lovell company , apparently continued , and the weapon is therefore mentioned here as a specific " Lovell " arm , rather than as simply another " Iver Johnson " revolver . The John P. Lovell Arms Co. took an assignment of Arthur Freeman Hood 's U.S. Patent No. 391613 ( dated 23rd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparently used in the hinged-frame " Swift " model , but the name itself seems to have come from Captain Eben Swift , of the Fifth U.S. Cavalry , to whom Farrow attributed the design jointly with a " Mr. Lovell " . This writer has not secured a specimen arm for illustration here , but A. C. Gould ( in the 1894 edition of his work ) described a ? 38 calibre  | double-action " Lovell ( Swift ) " revolver as having been provided for test by him , with the comment that it appeared to be a well-made arm , but that " . . . it was discovered to be too large in the bore to shoot any of the ammunition provided , and was withdrawn " . It is not clear from Gould 's use of that term whether he used the description " double action " in the American ( i.e. self-cocking ) or British manner , and it is therefore uncertain if the " Swift " weapon had a " Hammer " or a " Hammerless " action . " MALTBY HENLEY " revolvers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York sporting-goods jobbers , which was earlier mentioned in relation to solid-frame selfcocking " Columbian " revolvers , made for the firm under U.S. Patents Nos. 376922 and 413975 secured by John T. Smith . In addition to those weapons , a very similar type of pistol was marketed under the firm name , in ? 32 or ? 38 centre-fire calibres , but acknowledged the date of yet another Smith lock-mechanism patent ( in place of that relating to U.S. Patent No. 376922 ) , namely , 17th March , 1885 , the date of U.S. Patent No. 314067 . Arms bearing these revised patent dates were sold by this firm as both the " Parker Safety Hammerless " revolver in ? 32 centre-fire calibre , and as the " Maltby , Henley &; Co . Hammerless Model 1892 " , in either calibre ; both versions were five-shot arms , but the heavier " Model 1892 " arm had a detachable side-plate which the lighter " Model 1892 " pistol had not . An example of the latter , shown at Plate 6 , ended the life of Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1900 ) , in circumstances leading to a verdict of manslaughter against its user . In years prior to 1889 , the predecessor firm of Maltby , Curtis &; Co. ( at 34 Reade St. , New York ) had organized a revolver manufacturing company at Norwich , Conn. , called the Norwich Falls Pistol Co. , which had produced revolvers , roller-skates , and tools , under the U.S. patents of William H. Bliss ; manufacture had been suspended in 1887 or 1888 , but the possibility is mooted that stocks of such arms were inherited by Maltby , Henley &; Co. ( for sale in the early years of our period ) , and that manufacturing plant from the assets of the Norwich Falls Pistol Co. could have been available for use in production of the " Columbian " and associated model revolvers , if John T. Smith 's resources at Rockfall were , for any reason , inadequate . " MARLIN " revolvers John Mahlon Marlin had been a self-employed out-worker to the New Haven , Conn. , gun-trade during the early 186os , but had begun , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolvers ( of which " XXX Standard " , copies of Smith &; Wesson arms became the best-known ) for sale under his own name , around 1872 . Shortly afterwards , he had begun to produce single-shot Ballard rifles at New Haven , and in 1881 the Marlin Firearms Co. was incorporated , and the first of a most delightful line of lever-action tube-magazine rifles was introduced . During 1898 , the first Marlin shot-gun appeared , and by its founder 's death ( on i st July , 1901 ) , the Company was a well-established firearms manufacturer , with product-lines outside the scope of these pages . There had been , however , two earlier periods of activity by the Company which are in point here , involving manufacture of a rifle with rotary magazine ( noticed in remarks upon A. W. SAVAGE ; q.v. ) , and an unsuccessful attempt to vary the Company 's revolver-making activities . Thus , between 1884 and 1889 , Marlin had secured seven U.S. patents for cylinder-bolt , ejector , and barrel-latch features applicable to hingedframe self-ejecting revolvers , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Patents Nos. 366794 ( of 19th July , 1887 ) and 385009 ( of 26th June , 1888 ) for cylinder-retainer and ejector improvements to such arms . In 1886 , production of single-action revolvers was ended , preparatory to introducing a double-action line under this protection , and five-shot hinged-frame self-ejecting revolvers of this type , embodying a lock-mechanism closely modelled upon that shown in Figure 9 , were then briefly manufactured in ? 32 or ? 38 centre-fire calibres , and sold from 1887 until about 1900 . For reasons not wholly clear ( when the uniform excellence of other Marlin arms is considered ) , this double-action revolver venture was never successful and , in an 1894 edition of his book , A. C. Gould actually criticized specimen double-action Marlin revolvers ( submitted to him for test ) as positively dangerous to handle through careless manufacture . If quality-control in that particular section of the factory eluded Marlin executives , the cesser of such production was a wise decision . " MERIDEN " revolvers Both double-action and concealed-hammer self-ejecting revolvers ( of small calibre ) were sold under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Frank de Haas has described this manufacturer as owned by Messrs . Sears , Roebuck &; Co. , a large American mail-order firm . In addition , Mathews credits the Meriden firm with manufacturing " Eastern Arms Co . " , " Empire State " , " Federal Arms " , ' ' yrbcrg "  | and " Howard Arms " revolvers although , as earlier indicated , at least two of these identifications may be questioned . A surviving catalogue , of 191 4 , however , simply refers to the Meriden Firearms Company ( of Meriden , Conn. ) on both the cover and on the arms illustrated in it , and mentions only the Meriden Firearms Mfg . Co. at its page headings . Further , this text lays no claim whatsoever to use of patented features in those lines of inexpensive firearms shown upon its pages , which comprise shot-guns ( hammer , hammerless and slide-action ) , rifles ( slide-action or single-shot , in ? 22 rim-fire calibre ) , and ? 32 or ? 38 centre-fire revolvers similar in appearance to those Iver Johnson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in question is the name of H. A. Astlett &; Co. , of I I3 ? I17 Pearl St. , N.Y. , presumably as a distributor of the Meriden company 's products . Since these arms are clearly illustrated in the Meriden catalogue , it is possible to point out that most of the long-arms closely resemble lines also offered at that time by the J. Stevens Arms &; Tool Co. , of Chicopee Falls , Mass. , and the suggestion is therefore offered that some " Meriden " arms , at least , were actually made up from components supplied by the Stevens company . As to " Meriden " revolvers , it is true that the Stevens company is not now remembered as a manufacturer of such arms , but the reader 's attention is drawn to later remarks upon patents secured by it , and the suggestion again made that components could have been supplied from Chicopee Falls , for working and assembly at Meriden into some or all of the pistols shown in the 1914 catalogue . Whilst it is true to state that the catalogue text @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also be said that it is equally silent upon those connections suggested by de Haas and Mathews , for ownership by Sears , Roebuck &; Co. and access to the patents of Andrew Fyrberg , respectively . " MERWIN HULBERT " revolvers Enough has been said ( in remarks upon " Hopkins &; Allen " revolvers ) to avoid need for description here of the activities of Merwin Hulbert &; Co. , or the successor Hulbert Bros . &; Co. , during our period . As to the revolvers sold by this New York firm , three basic types should be noted , as single-action " Suicide Specials " , and two types of double-action revolver ; the first were unremarkable solid-framed rimfire weapons ( sold under the names " Ranger " , " Dictator " , " Czar " or " Blue Jacket " ) , manufactured by the Hopkins &; Allen Mfg . Co. until 1898 , and part of the second category consisted of solid-frame " XL " or hinged-frame double-action self-ejecting " Automatic " Hopkins &; Allen revolvers sold ( with and without folding hammer-spurs ) as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workmanship in these arms was criticized by A. C. Gould , in the 1894 edition of his book . In the third category , however , were self-extracting ( rather than selfejecting ) arms of a type almost unique in America , which the Hopkins &; Allen Mfg . Co. made exclusively for the New York house ( under patents controlled by the latter ) , where the barrel was not hinged to the frame for operation of an ejector , but had to be unlatched , turned over on its arbor to free cuts in the top-strap from engagement with an inverted " L " - shaped joint on top of the standing-breech , and then pulled straight forward . This straight-pull movement operated in a manner also used by another American inventor ( O. JONES , q.v. ) , and withdrew the cartridge-cases from their chambers , as the cylinder moved forward in train with the barrel , by a star-shaped extractor fixed to the standing-breech . First introduced by J. Merwin , M. H. Hulbert and W. A. Hulbert around 1877 , in substantial single-action " Army " revolvers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ( during our period ) normally applied to double-action pocket models , often fitted with the S. S. Hopkins folding hammer-spur , in 5 X ? 38 or 7 X ? 32 centre-fire calibres ; however , ? 44 centre-fire calibre revolvers ( in both single- and double-action versions ) could also be purchased by those needing such substantial 36/41 oz. pistols , and a spurtrigger single-action pocket revolver was available to conservative buyers . Although not always acknowledging the source of their manufacture , such double-action weapons were of adequate quality , and some versions were sold with interchangeable 3 2- and 51  --  in. barrels . Amongst earlier patents , the double-action " M. H. &; Co . Automatic Ejecting Revolvers " ( as they were marketed ) acknowledged patent dates of 14th March , 1882 , and 9th January , 1883 , respectively relating to U.S. Patents Nos. 254798 and 270204 held by George W. Cilley , of Norwich , Conn . These were patents relating to improved double action lock-mechanisms suitable for such arms , and Cilley held three other U.S. lock-mechanism patents ( Nos. 263684 ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed that frame-configuration peculiar to Merwin Hulbert Arms . It is not known if revolvers were produced under those patents , however . " MINNEAPOLIS F. A. CO. " revolvers See Appendix II ? FINNEGAN , P. H. " NEW YORK ARMS CO. " revolvers See " Columbian " revolvers .  | " PARKER " revolvers See " Maltby Henley " revolvers . " REID " revolvers See Appendix II ? REID , G. E. " REMINGTON " revolvers Although a noted revolver manufacturer in the years 18J7-88 , the Remington Arms Co. had drifted into financial difficulties by the opening of our period , and a reorganization of that Company ( by a majority shareholder ) led to the discarding of this type of firearm , as a serious part of its production-line , after 1889 . It is probable that single-action " New Line " rim-fire and " Model 1875 " ? 44 or ? 45 calibre centre-fire Remington revolvers continued to be sold for some years , whilst stocks lasted , but this Company 's small efforts in the hand-gun field were , after 1889 , concentrated upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , almost to the exclusion of revolvers . A lightened version of the single-action " Model 1875 " revolver was produced and sold ( as the " Model 1890 " arm ) from 1891-94 , but the Karrs estimate total production at only about 2,000 pistols , and so Remington 's contribution to these pages must therefore be dismissed as negligible . " RUPERTUS " revolvers See Appendix II ? RUPERTUS , J. " RYAN " revolvers Thomas E. Ryan died in 1891 , after manufacturing cheap single action " Suicide Special " revolvers , of a type described below , for nearly a quarter of a century . He was based at Norwich , Conn. ( where Wm . Paul Smith credits him with forty-five employees and a monthly output of 30,000 revolvers , in 1887 ) , but marketed arms through his Ryan Pistol Manufacturing Co. , in New York . It is possible , but not established , that he began to manufacture double-action revolvers , between 1885 and the time of his death . " SCOTT " revolvers A brass-framed revolver similar to the " Columbian New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centre-fire calibre , with the marking " J. N. Scott Safety Hammerless " . This pistol acknowledged the dates of those John T. Smith U.S. Patents Nos. 376922 and 413975 earlier mentioned in remarks upon the " Columbian " arms , and it was  | presumably made at the same plant , but possibly to the order of another principal . " SMITH " revolvers In studying arms relevant to the period 1889-1914 , the reader may encounter two obsolete revolvers with the name " Smith " upon them , which strictly date from preceding years , but may still have been marketed into the early 189os . Otis A. Smith ( at Rockfall , Conn. ) had produced a series of solidframed single-action rim-fire revolvers , which should be distinguished from " Suicide Special " arms later mentioned , by their superior workmanship and use of a quick-dismount device for their cylinders , covered by his U.S. Patent No. 137968 of 15th April , 1873 . The patentee manufactured such arms in ? 22 , ? 32 , ? 38 or ? 41 rim-fire calibres , until 1890 or 1891 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A. Smith and John T. Smith had jointly secured U.S. Patent No. 251306 , and produced a five-shot ? 32 calibre single-action hinged-frame " Model 1883 Shell Ejector " revolver under that protection . This arm was still available during our period ( resembling the Smith &; Wesson revolver shown as a catalogue illustration on Plate 38 , save that it had a stud-trigger ) , and was later joined by other John T. Smith designs earlier described in remarks upon " Columbian " and " Maltby , Henley &; Co. " revolvers . " SMITH &; WESSON " revolvers In view of later notes upon the firm ( under D. B. WESSON , q.v. ) , and of excellent specialist works detailing the course by which such arms evolved , remarks here will be limited to describing those " Smith &; Wesson " revolvers available during our period . Thus the Springfield , Mass. , factory of this firm produced both hinged-frame self-ejecting and solid-frame swing-out cylinder arms between 1889 and 1914 , the latter having manually-operated ejectors of a type earlier described in remarks upon similar " Colt " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our period were : The Safety Hammerless , or " New Departure " models ; see Plate 36 . The Double Action models ; see Plate 5 . The Single Action pocket models ; see Plate 38 . The No. 3 New Model or Target models ; whilst the solid-frame arms of that period , with swing-out cylinders , were :  | The Model ( I ) ? 32 Calibre Hand Ejector ; see Plate 5 The Model ? 38 Hand Ejector Military &; Police The Model ? 32 ? 2o Hand Ejector Winchester The Model ( M ) ? 22 Calibre Hand Ejector ; see Plate 36 The Model ? 44 Hand Ejector ( New Century ) ; see Plate 38 Dealing first with hinged-frame arms , the Safety Hammerless design had been introduced as a five-shot ? 38 centre-fire weapon ( with barrel Icm ul ) ' 43 ? L o , 1 , : 4 figure " s " is the safety-lever , and " u " the safety-latch ; both are hinged at the lower end , and a flat spring normally holds " u " in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rearward movement . When the butt is gripped , the upper end of " s " is depressed and , in turn , tilts " u " upwards to clear the hammer for cocking by the trigger . The self-cocking lock-mechanism is conventional , using the mainspring stirrup to rebound the hammer , and having an ordinary lifter mounted upon a common pivot with the pawl . The cylinder-bolt is unusually long , however , and is operated by a projection beneath the hammer , which strikes a split-spring component as the travel of the hammer occurs , in cocking . lengths of 3+ , 4 or 5 inches ) in 1887 , and followed next year by a smaller ? 32 calibre version ; these were self-cocking concealed-hammer revolvers ( with that lock-mechanism shown in Figure 8 ) , using hinged-frame cartridge-ejection , and with a press-in safety-lever in the butt-strap , which blocked all movement of the hammer unless that lever was first depressed , by gripping the butt in a fashion normal for firing . Publicized as the " New Departure " , this design was popular until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such arms ( in the two different models ) were manufactured during our period alone .  | Indeed , the ? 38 calibre arm was so highly regarded that nearly one hundred pistols were extensively and seriously field-tested by a U.S. Ordnance Board , before that Board eventually secured adoption , by the U.S. Army , of a Colt " New Army " double-action revolver ( Model of 1892 ) earlier described . The .38 calibre Safety Hammerless revolvers made between July 1888 and August 1890 embodied features covered by five U.S. patents , respectively secured on loth February , 1877 ; 18th December , 1877 ; 11th May , 188o ; 4th August , 1885 ; and 11th October , 1887 . The patents in point were Nos. 187689 and 198228 ( D. B. WESSON and J. H. Bullard ) covering the cylinder-retainer and hammer-rebound , 227481 ( J. H. Bullard ) covering the ejector-cam , 323839 ( D. B. &; J. H. WESSON ) covering the grip-safety , and 371532 ( D. B. WESSON ) covering the rather complex press-button barrel-latch . In 189o , this line was extended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designimprovements were also embodied , in respect of a hardened steel abutment shoulder on the barrel-latch post ( D. B. WESSON 's U.S. Patent No. 377878 of 14th February , 1888 ) , hardened steel inserts on the wearing side of each cylinder locking-notch ( D. B. WESSON 's U.S. Patent No. 401087 of 9th April , 1888 ) , and a simplified press-button barrel-latch ; this latter feature was described in the claims of D. B. WESSON 's U.S. Patent No. 429397 , of 3rd June , 189o , as then already in use , although the design feature claimed in the patent ( a hammerblock working off the barrel-latch ) was never embodied in production arms . Finally , late in 1898 , this model was again modified , by replacing the 1890 press-button barrel-latch with a lift-up design , having knurled side-surfaces for gripping between thumb and forefinger . The ? 32 calibre Safety Hammerless model ( see Plate 36 ) was first offered with a 3- or 31-in. barrel , but the longer barrel was discarded around 1900 , shortly after a " Bicycle " model , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weapons are regarded by most authorities as having undergone only one design change during our period when ( in September , 1900 ) a press-button barrel-latch was replaced with the lift-up device adopted in 1898 for ? 38 calibre arms . On this contention , however , it is worth recording that pre-1900 Smith &; Wesson catalogue illustrations of the ' 32 calibre pistol show a pressbutton barrel-latch of the type introduced in 1890 for the .38 calibre arms , rather than the earlier press-button design covered by D. B. WESSON 's U.S. Patent No. 371532 ( above-mentioned ) which would presumably be the design feature to be reckoned upon if the ' 32 calibre model in fact underwent only this 1900 design change . In turning to Smith &; Wesson Double Action revolvers of a type  | shown at Plate 5 , it should be emphasized that these hinged-frame selfejecting models were quite elderly at the opening of our period , ? 32 and ? 38 centre-fire calibre versions having been introduced in 1880 , and a ' 44 centre-fire calibre pistol in the following year ; however , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ? 38 calibre weapon underwent design-changes in 1894 and 1909 , and the heaviest models were only discontinued in 1910 and 1913 , so that such arms may be legitimately noticed here . A lock-mechanism shown in Figure 9 was used in Smith &; Wesson Double Action models of our period ( other than a " Perfected " model , later noticed ) , and may be seen as little more than a cleverly modified version of that European service revolver mechanism discussed in Chapter II , and illustrated in Figure 15 ; the two smaller versions of this mechanism used that type of cylinder-bolt shown in Figure 9 ( which had been patented by J. H. Wesson as U.S. Patent No. 251750 of 3rd January , 1882 , and as Br . Pat . No. 5569 of 20th December , 1881 ) , but the ' 44 calibre arms clung to a more complex rocking cylinder-bolt requiring two rows of locking-notches around the cylinder , which was protected by D. B. WESSON 's U.S. Patents Nos. 222168 , of 2nd December , 1879 , and 228009 , of 25th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ models was that covered by the Bullard patent of 188o noted in remarks upon Safety Hammerless revolvers , whilst cylinderretaining and lift-up barrel-latch devices were to the D. B. WESSON/J . H. Bullard patents of 1877 also noticed with " New Departure " arms . A most noticeable change in the two smaller models , during our period , involved elimination from the trigger-guard of a reverse curve ( at the rear ) visible in Plate 5 , and this refinement occurred in 1889 for the ? 32 calibre pistol , but was not introduced for ? 38 calibre arms until 1894 and was never applied to the arms of heaviest calibre . All three versions , however , eventually embodied both the steel-shimmed cylinder locking-notches covered by D. B. WESSON 's U.S. Patent No. 401087 ( mentioned in relation to Safety Hammerless weapons ) , and hardened steel bearing-bosses fitted into the frame-walls and sideplates , to reduce friction incurred by rubbing of hammer and trigger surfaces against the sides of a pistol . Between 1889 and 1914 , the five-shot ? 32 calibre revolvers could be bought with barrel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and .38 calibre arms ( in " Double Action " or the late " Perfected " models ) with a barrel 34 , 4 , 5 or 6 inches long ; the ? 44 calibre pistols ( sold by " New Model Army " , " New Model Navy " , " Double Action " , " Wesson Favourite " , and " Frontier " names ) were offered in ' 44 Russian or ' 44 ? 40 WCF chamberings , with barrel lengths of 4 , 5 , 6 or 6 , i inches . " Perfected " ? 38  | calibre revolvers were introduced in 1909 , apparently in an attempt to prolong demand for hinged-frame arms , and differed markedly from any predecessors , since their lock-mechanism was that later described in remarks upon " Hand Ejector , Model 1 " pistols , and not the mechanism shown at Figure 9 . Further , the barrel was double-latched ( on a principle covered by D. B. WESSON 's U.S. Patent No. 68415o of 8th October , 1901 ) , so that the user raised a lift-up barrel latch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after he had pressed forward a sliding thumbpiece , on the left of the frame , to unseat a longitudinal bolt of a kind indicated in remarks upon D. B. WESSON 's Br . Pat . 6184/1894 . " Wesson Favourite " ? 44 calibre revolvers differed from other hinged frame arms in that calibre , only by the ingenuity expended upon machining all surplus metal from them . Standard " Double Action " revolvers of our period were generously stamped with patent dates , some referring to those few lately-patented features described above and others to past glories of design dating as far back as 1865 , but the " Perfected " model was , for obvious reasons , an exception in this respect . Patent dates in this case were 4th August , 1896 ( D. B. &; J. H. WESSON 'S U.S. Patent No. 565245 , covering hardened steel bushings for the sliding cylinder-latch , and a " hand lever " which operated the pawl ) , 8th October 1901 ( D. B. WESSON 's U.S. Patent No. 68415o above-mentioned ) , 6th February , ' gob ( J. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sliding hammer-rebound later described in remarks upon post-1905 " Hand Ejector " revolvers ) , and 14th September , 1909 ( C. M. Stone 's U.S. Patent No. 933797 , covering means later described for increasing the arc of the hammerthrow during self-cocking fire ) , instead of the other markings earlier mentioned . As to Smith &; Wesson single-action hinged-frame revolvers of the period , and whether as pocket arms or as " No. 3 New Model " and Target pistols , it must again be said that these were designs of an earlier period ; their beautiful workmanship and mechanical excellence ensured sufficient demand for production to continue , but their undoubted contribution to any state of the art had been made many years before 1889 . During our period , there were actually three single-action hinged frame self-ejecting centre-fire Smith &; Wesson revolvers marketed ; the 5 X ? 32 calibre Model No. 12 had a bird 's head butt and spur-trigger ( with available barrel lengths of 3 , 3 z or 6 inches ) , whilst the 5 X ? 38 calibre Model 188o had a flat-bottomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 , 5 or 6 inches available . Manufacture of both these models had ceased by 1892 ( a weapon shown at Plate 38 having  | rendered them superfluous , on its introduction in 1891 ) , although the Model 188o revolver continued to be catalogued for some years after that date . As can be seen from Plate 38 , the ? 38 Single Action Model 1881 revolvers had a trigger-guard in place of an earlier spur-trigger but the weapon embodied no mechanical improvement over its predecessors , and was chiefly remarkable for the fact that , as may be seen in Plate 38 , a single-shot target barrel ( of 6 , 8 or f o inches in length ) could be used interchangeably with the centre-fire barrel and cylinder and was available in ? 22 rim-fire and ' 32 or ' 38 centre-fire calibres . In the event , this weapon proved a better target pistol than pocket arm , and although manufacture of the Model 1891 revolver was not discontinued until 1911 , a single-shot target pistol incapable of conversion to a revolver was introduced in 1905 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in most successful use for decades after 1914 . As to the big " No. 3 New Model " and Target single-action hinged frame revolvers , in our period , the Smith &; Wesson catalogues of those times offered such arms in ? 32-44 , ' 38-44 , ' 38 WCF , ' 44 Russian , ' 44 WCF , and .45o Eley calibres , with barrel lengths of from 4 to 62 inches available for all calibres ( but with an 8-in , barrel also manufactured for the superbly accurate ' 44 Russian cartridge ) , and with special sights fitted to target arms . All barrels were impressed with patent dates , but ( as with most " Double Action " revolvers ) these related to protection secured in the 186os and 187os , when Smith &; Wesson had led American arms manufacturers into the era of hinged-frame self-ejecting weapons . These models had , in years relevant here , little to commend them save their superb workmanship and accuracy , for they had been early rendered obsolete by double-action swing-out cylinder arms next to be described . Thus manufacture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although dealers continued to catalogue them for some years afterwards . In turning now to consider solid-frame " Smith &; Wesson " revolvers with swing-out cylinders and manually-operated ejectors , it should be noticed that ( for good and sufficient reasons ) the Springfield firm here proceeded at a rather more leisurely pace than had been adopted by its principal competitor . Thus , it will be recalled , the COLT 'S PATENT FIRE ARMS MANUFACTURING CO . ( INC. ) ( q.v. ) introduced a " New Navy " revolver of this type as early as 1889 , but that Company 's hand-gun line then comprised obsolete solid-frame rod-ejecting pistols only , and some sort of ' fillip to the range must have been seen as an urgent need ; at Springfield , on the other hand , excellent hinged-frame self-ejecting revolvers had long been a " Smith &; Wesson " staple , so that  | little real need for the adoption of a competing design could be demonstrated during the i 88os or 18gos , and such an arm was not actually introduced until nearly seven years after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ejector , Model 1896 " by its makers , this first Smith &; Wesson swing-out cylinder design is today frequently referred to as the " Hand Ejector , Model 1 " , and shown at Plate 5 ( top ) ; it is a double-action revolver , chambered for six ? 32 S &W; Long cartridges , and was available in barrel lengths of 34 inches ( 174 oz. ) , 44 Fie . 9 . Smith &; Wesson double-action lock-mechanism for hinged frame revolvers . The firing-cycle of this lock-mechanism is the same as that for the French design described in relation to Figure 15 , but the cylinder-bolt ( shown separately , below , in the Figure above ) is peculiar to the American weapon . inches ( 182 oz. ) or 6 inches ( 20 oz. ) , with a choice of blued or nickel plate finishes , and target sights as an optional extra . The lock-mechanism is shown at Figure 1o , and will be seen to have a superficial similarity to the Colt mechanism shown at Figure 2 ( save for the use of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rocked in or out of engagement with the cylinder by the hammer-nose ) , but to be a most ingenious design in its own right , when examined . The cylinder was , of course , crane-mounted to swing sideways out of the frame ( when loading or ejecting cartridges ) and latched home in that manner later described with remarks upon D. B. WESSON 's Br . Pat . 6184/1894 . In Figure to , " A " is the hammer , " B " the trigger , " C " the cylinderbolt , " D " the pawl , " F " the trigger-lever , and " G " the rebound-lever ; the pawl " D " ( pivoted on " B " ) is held forward into engagement with a  | rotating-ratchet on the cylinder by means of " E " , a small " hand lever " , later protected by D. B. &; J. H. Wesson 's U.S. Patent No. 565245 of 4th August , 1896 . This " hand lever " rocks in a longitudinally-cut chamber at the top of the trigger and is tensioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pin projecting ( from the left side of the pawl ) into the hand-lever chamber , via an arcuate slot cut in the right side of the trigger . Hammer and trigger movements follow a cycle described for that Colt mechanism shown at Figure 2 , in self-cocking or single-action fire , but with the hammer of this Smith &; Wesson design operating the io . Smith &; Wesson double-action lock-mechanism , Model 1896 . " A " is the hammer , " B " the trigger , " C " the cylinder-bolt , " D " the pawl or hand ( tensioned by the hand-lever " E " ) . " F " is the trigger-lever , and " G " the rebound-lever. cylinder-bolt , and with the long trigger-lever " F " returning the trigger " B " to rest , after firing , and operating the rebound-lever " G " to turn the hammer-nose back off the cartridges . Engraved upon the Model 1896 Hand Ejector revolver shown in Plate 5 are references to patent dates of 1st July , 1884 , 9th April , 1889 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 21st May , 1895 , and 16th July , 1895 , some of which present problems in identifying those American patents to which they were intended to refer . Thus , W. Trabue secured U.S. Patents Nos. 30118o and 301181 on the first-mentioned date , and that reference was probably directed to both patents , as proposing use of a manually-operated star-shaped ejector ( in a swing-out cylinder ) , although not in the manner actually used here ; the second date was that of D. B. WESSON 's U.S. Patent No. 401087 ( earlier mentioned ) for the steel-shimmed cylinder locking-notches . The succeeding dates  | respectively related to U.S. Patents Nos. 517152 ( D. B. WESSON ) covering those cylinder-latch and hammer-block features described in Appendix II remarks upon this patentee 's Br . Pat . 6184/1894 ; 520,468 ( D. B. WESSON ) , which was an obscure reference for this particular model , but could be cited for use of anti-friction bosses in the framewalls ; 539497 ( D. B. &; J. H. WESSON ) , again obscure since the patent claims related to a sliding cylinder-latch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D. B. WESSON ) covering the trigger-lever " F " and rebound-lever " G " shown at Figure 10 . Smith &; Wesson 's next Hand Ejector revolver was catalogued by them as the " ? 38 Military , Model 1899 " , although it is more commonly described today as the " Model 1899 Army-Navy " or " Military &; Police " model ; this was a double-action revolver , chambered for six ? 38 calibre Long Colt centre-fire cartridges , and available in 294 OZ. ( 4-in. barrel ) , 30 oz. ( 5-in. barrel ) , or 314 oz. ( q-in. barrel ) embodiments . Lieut. - Col . R. C. Kuhn records that the U.S. Navy ordered 1,000 of the arms in 1900 , and that the U.S. Army received a like quantity in the following year ; the ? 38 calibre cartridge had ( as indicated in earlier remarks upon Colt arms ) an unfortunate combat record in the Philippine campaign , and although the U.S. Navy subsequently ordered 1,000 improved " Model 1902 " weapons of this calibre , the U.S. Army displayed no further interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a version chambered for ? 32 ? 2o WCF cartridges was offered with the ? 38 calibre arms , throughout our period . Although larger , the Model 1899 revolver was quite similar in appearance to Model 1896 pistols , and patent dates marked upon it recognized design features earlier described , in remarks upon U.S. Patents Nos. 30118o ; 401087 ; 539497 ; 542744 ; and 565245 . However , those markings also recognized further improvements to the 1896 design , by reference to patent dates of 22nd December , 1896 ( D. B. &; J. H. WESSON 'S U.S. Patent No. 573736 , for using the sliding cylinderlatch to bolt the hammer , if full latching of the cylinder had not occurred ) , and 4th October , 1898 ( D. B. &; J. H. WESSON 'S U.S. Patent No. 611826 , for a rocking cylinder-bolt situated over the trigger , in place of the Model 1896 cylinder-bolt in the top frame-strap ) , although regard was not had to the sliding cylinder-latch ( operated by a thumb-piece on the right of the frame ) , which had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1902 , one of the few Smith &; Wesson design features open to criticism was eliminated from " Military &; Police " revolvers , by provision ( in a new model ) of fore-and-aft locking for the cylinder-latch , in accordance with I ) . B. WESSON 's U.S. Patent No. 68926o of 17th  | December , 1901 . The date of this improvement was added to the markings upon such arms , and it was accomplished in that manner shown at Figure 71 , and for those reasons mentioned in remarks upon the patentee 's Br . Pat . 24597/1901 ; the refinement introduced a heavy barrel-lug ( in which the front latching-nib was located ) , which remains a distinctive feature of Smith &; Wesson revolvers to this day . Other changes in the 1899 construction involved use of anti-friction surfaces upon the hammer and trigger , as claimed by D. B. WESSON 's U.S Patent No. 520468 of 29th May , 1894 , and chambering for the potent ? 38 S &; W Special cartridge . 1902 was also the year in which Smith &; Wesson 's first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Known to collectors as the " Model ( M ) " , this was a seven-shot pistol , offered in barrel lengths of 24 , 3 or 32 inches , had its cylinder-latch operated by a large pressbutton on the right of the frame , and was produced in quite modest numbers . Between 1903 and 1906 , a number of detailed changes were made to existing Smith &; Wesson Hand Ejector arms . The Model ( 1 ) ? 32 calibre model of 1903 had a conventional sliding cylinder-latch ( located on the left of the frame ) and , save for a brief period between 1904 and 1906 , the rocking cylinder-bolt covered by that U.S. Patent No. 611826 earlier mentioned was embodied in it for the remainder of our period . The ? 38 calibre Military &; Police arm , after more minor changes in 1903 and 1905 , was fitted with a rebound-slide of the type shown in Figure 11 ; this was an important modification ( covered by J. H. Wesson 's U.S. Patent No. 811807 , of 6th February , 1906 ) , eliminating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanism at Figure 10 , and is used in Smith &; Wesson revolvers even today . In Figure 11 , " r " is the hammer , " s " the trigger , and " t " the rebound slide ; in self-cocking fire , pressure on the trigger " s " pushes back " t " to a point where the rebound lump on top of it is sufficiently far to the rear for the hammer not to strike that lump in falling . On release of the trigger , a coiled spring within " t " pushes the rebound-slide forward ( which movement , by a linkage shown in Figure 11 , also restores the trigger to its " at rest " position ) and the rebound lump strikes the base of the hammer " r " , and turns this back off the cartridges . An accidental blow upon the hammer , when it is down , should not drive " r " forward on to the cartridges , since the base of the hammer will strike the rebound lump on " t " , and prevent forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the hammer accidentally slips from under the firer 's thumb , in single-action cocking .  | The year 1906 also saw some redesigning of the Model ( M ) ? 22 rimfire revolver , from which the side cylinder-latch was now removed . To replace that device , a system quite similar to the Model ( 1 ) latch was embodied , where a knob in front of the barrel-lug ( which is visible on a later version of the Model ( M ) shown in Plate 36 ) was pulled forward by the user , as claimed by J. H. Wesson 's U.S. Patent No. 743784 , loth November , 1903 . In the same year ( 1906 ) , ? 32 calibre Hand Ejector revolvers also received the rebound-slide shown in Figure 11 . Smith &; Wesson double-action lock-mechanism , Model 1906. " a " is the cylinder-bolt , " e " the inner part of the sliding cylinder-latch ( which fouls the tail of the hammer , to prevent cocking , if the cylinder is not properly latched into the frame ) , " r " is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " t " the rebound-slide ; the pawl and hand-lever are shown only in outline , but function as described in relation to the lock-mechanism shown in Figure to . In 1907 , the firm produced its first heavy-calibre Hand Ejector revolvers , in the shape of a " New Century " pistol ( of that type shown at Plate 38 ) , which is now more popularly known as the " Triple Lock " model , since it embodied a three-point cylinder-latch covered by the U.S. Patent No. 688141 , of D. B. WESSON , discussed in remarks upon that patentee 's Br . Pat . 24588/1901 and shown in Figure 70 . Offered in barrel lengths of 4. , 5 , 62 or 71 inches , and in versions chambered for the ? 44 . Russian , ? 44 S &; W Special , ? 45 Colt , and ? 450 or ? 455 Hey centrefire cartridges , this was a superb revolver . Early models carried patent  | dates acknowledging U.S. Patents Nos. 565245 and 573736 earlier noticed , but specimens likely to be encountered by British collectors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are marked also with the patent dates of 8th October , 1901 ( D. B. WESSON 's U.S. Patent No. 684150 , covering use of the " Perfected " revolver 's sliding cylinderlatch ) , 3rd December , 1901 ( D. B. WESSON 's U.S. Patent No. 688141 , covering the cylinder-latch shown at Figure 70 ) , and 6th February , 1906 ( covering J. H. Wesson 's U.S. Patent No. 811807 ) for the rebound-slide shown in Figure 11 . After minor modifications to the lock-mechanism of ? 32 Calibre Model ( I ) arms ( in 1909 and 1910 ) , an important improvement to that mechanism was introduced in 1910 , under C. M. Stone 's U.S. Patent No. 933797 , earlier mentioned in remarks upon hinged-frame " Perfected " revolvers . This improvement ( which was applied to both " Military &; Police " and ? 32 ? 2o Winchester Hand Ejector pistols , in the same year ) improved self-cocking fire greatly , by providing a backward throw of the hammer through an arc as great as that for single action fire , to improve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a smoother motion to the hammer in the last moments of its self-cocking travel to the rear . Stone actually accomplished these aims by shaping hammer-toe and trigger-nose to engage at that moment when the hammer-catch slipped off the trigger in self-cocking fire ( which stole the extra bit of hammer-travel ) , and by realigning the pivots of hammer and trigger to yield a last point of engagement , between hammer and trigger , in a straight line drawn between those pivots . Finally , in May and June of 1911 , Smith &; Wesson issued two ? 22 rim-fire revolvers , which were the last arms relevant to these pages . The first of these ( see Plate 36 ) was an improved version of the Model ( M ) Hand Ejector , with square-bottomed butt and C. M. Stone 's lock-mechanism improvement , under U.S. Patent No. 933797 earlier mentioned ; the second ( known as the " ? 22/32 Target " , or " Bekeart Model " , after a dealer who suggested its design ) was actually a six-shot pistol , built upon the frame and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calibre revolver , with 6-in. barrel and target sights . " STEVENS " revolvers The .1 . Stevens Arms &; Tool Co. had been incorporated , in 1888 , to take over a twenty-five-year-old private firm . It was based at Chicopee Falls , Mass. , and manufactured considerable quantities of small-arms during our period , in lines which latterly embraced pump-action and double- or single-barrelled shot-guns , target pistols , single-shot or A  | repeating rifles , sights , and cleaning or reloading accessories ; most of these products were sold to U.S. dealers and to overseas agents ( the pre-1914 London sales offices being located at 15 Grape St. , off Shaftesbury Avenue ) , and the Company is still operating today . As remarked in relation to " Meriden " arms , the Stevens Company is not now remembered as a revolver manufacturer , but it is a fact that assignments were taken by it ( from the patentee , Oscar F. Mossberg ) of U.S. Patents Nos. 778500 and 778501 relating to revolving arms ; the first of these patents ( both of which were dated 27th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for use in a hinged-frame revolver with grip-safety , and the second to a double-action lockmechanism . This writer has never seen revolvers marked with either the relevant patent date or the Stevens name , but a possibility clearly exists that such arms were produced by this maker . " SUICIDE SPECIAL " revolvers This name was used by Donald B. Webster , Jr . to describe those inexpensive single-action , solid-frame , stud-trigger and predominantly rimfire pocket revolvers to which his trail-blazing book was devoted , and is here also extended to cover weapons of similar appearance , but better quality , which were made by the Colt and Remington firms . In terms of that period studied here , such arms were obsolete , and superseded by inexpensive double-action or self cocking designs made by firms like the Harrington &; Richardson Arms Co. , or Iver Johnson 's Arms &; Cycle Works , for example , but large stocks held by manufacturers formerly specializing in them , and a demand for revolvers selling at prices as low as 6o cents apiece , ensured a traffic in " Suicide Specials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed , most of those manufacturers wholly dependent upon " Suicide Specials " , as their stock-in-trade , were out of business , but it is believed that the following firms were ready to supply such revolvers ( although sometimes producing more modern designs , at the same time ) to wholesalers and mail-order firms , during our period : Aetna Arms Co. , New York ( until 189o ) Bacon Manufacturing Co. , Norwich , Conn.

Robertson 's U.S. Patents ( Nos. 708078 , 710008 and 816125 ) to the Thames Arms Co. were also recorded , and Mathews lists revolvers made under the first two patents as another product of this company . The earliest patent ( dated 2nd September , 1902 ) proposed use of a split spring-steel arbor for retaining the cylinder of self-ejecting revolvers ; the second patent ( dated 3oth September , 1902 ) covered an ejector mechanism for use in such arms , as did the third , which was dated 27th March , 1906 .

A small-calibre version of Lefever 's pistol was made by the Union Firearms Co. , of Toledo , Ohio , but little is known of this company , save that it also sold repeating rifles and double-barrelled shot-guns .

AUSTRO-HUNGARIAN revolvers During our period , a number of self-loading pistols were field-tested for possible adoption by the Austro-Hungarian armed forces , and two such arms ( the Roth M/1907 and Steyr M/1912 designs ) were in limited issue by 1914 . However , as a result of this forward-looking concern with competing hand-gun designs , Austrian service revolvers in issue between 1889 and 1914 comprised but three models ( only one of which actually appeared during those years ) , namely , the Gasser Model 1870 ? 74 , the Gasser-Kropatschek , and the Rast &; Gasser Model 1898 pistols . A rare Naval model of the M/1870 ? 74 Gasser is shown at Plate 7 ( top ) , but differs from the more common Army version only by use of a barrel-securing wedge ( passing through both barrel-lug and arbor ) omitted from the latter weapon ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an overall length of over I 2 2 inches ( 320 mm. ) , a 74-in. ( 184-mm. ) barrel ( rifled with six grooves , twisted to the right ) and weighing over 3 lb. ( 1370 g. ) unloaded . They were , moreover , gate-loaded ( so that each cartridge had to be separately ejected from its chamber , by use of a rod-ejector visible in Plate 7 ) , and this M/187o ? 74 pattern really differed from the original M/187o issue only by its use of a steel action-body , in place of an original iron component . The double-action lock-mechanism , with its distinctive leafspring half-cock device lying along the right side of the frame , was a relic from the past , and is sufficiently described and illustrated in another place. * The Gasser-Kropatschek **27;109;TOOLONG may be seen at Plate 7 ( lower ) , as merely a scaled-down version of the M/187o ? 74 arm , chambering six 9-mm. centre-fire cartridges , weighing slightly over 12 lbs . ( 770 g. ) unloaded ( with 4s-in. ( 120-mm. ) barrel ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) The Rast &; Gasser M/1898 revolver is shown as Plate 12 ( top ) , and was an eight-shot , gate-loaded , solid-framed , rod-ejecting , double action weapon , having a frame-mounted firing-pin and that " Schmidt Galand " lock-mechanism ( sketched as Fig. 12 ) , the basic operation of * The Revolver , 1865-1888 . A. Taylerson. llerbert Jenkins . London , 1965.  | which is described at p. 4o ; intended for issue to infantry officers and N.C.O.s , this arm was chambered for an 8-mm. centre-fire cartridge , had an overall length of about 9 inches ( 226 mm. ) , with a 42-in. ( 117-mm. ) barrel rifled by four grooves twisted to the right , and weighed just under 2 lb. ( 900 g. ) when unloaded . Though of curious appearance to modern eyes , these were beautifully-made pistols , with an improved loading-gate safety-device ( based upon the Portuguese " Abadie " system , later mentioned ) which not only disconnected trigger from figure hammer , when the gate was swung open , but also bolted the latter . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardened lead bullet ( propelled by a charge of smokeless Jagd  --  und Schiebenpulver No. 2 , at a muzzle-velocity of about 750 f.p.s. ) had a penetration rather than a knock-down value . One excellent feature was the take-down system , by which the trigger-guard ( the rear end of which was normally latched into the frame ) could be pulled down , on a pivot at its front , to release the hinged left-hand side-plate affording access to the lock-mechanism . Total production of Model 1898 revolvers is difficult to estimate ; this writer has seen serial-numbers only as high as 122432 , and believes that all weapons marked " Rast &; Gasser " were consecutively numbered . Writing in 1903 , 1. cleu alleged that an improved version of the N1/1898 revolver was then to be issued to Austrian cavalry , embodying  | " un extracteur collectif " , and using a charger for loading all chambers simultaneously ; the latter , presumably , of a kind similar to those devices mentioned in relation to W. DE C. PRIDEAUX or A. J. WATSON ( q.v . ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " as reference to a major reshaping of the M/1898 arm , by provision of a crane-mounted swing-out cylinder , or even a hinged-frame and selfejection . In fact ( although no specimen arm could be located , to clarify this point ) , any such improvement probably consisted in mounting a manually-operated star-shaped push-rod ejector in the cylinder , which could be operated after the cylinder had been removed from the frame . For an Empire containing a large small arms industry , AustroHungarian manufacturers of civilian revolvers remain curiously anonymous ( save as indicated in Chapter IV ) , with only the names of Viennese suppliers like Leopold Gasser and the associated firm of Rast &; Gasser , or Springer , now seeming to survive upon an appreciable quantity of arms . Possibly new self-loading pistol designs were more fashionable after 1900 , with designers and public alike but , whatever the actual reasons , Austrian civilian revolvers of our period are now best remembered in the shape of one particular pattern , a so-called " Montenegrin " weapon of the type shown in Plate 8 ( top ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King Nicholas ( 191 o ? 18 ) were required by law to purchase , so the story went , and this to a pattern made by companies in which ( again by rumour ) the sovereign himself held shares . Although Belgian revolvers ( both selfejecting and solid-frame ) of an appearance similar to that pattern now to be described will be found in some numbers , examination of surviving arms does suggest that certainly two ( and possibly three ) models of a relevant type of revolver were made in Austria , and that if a " Montenegrin " pattern ever formally existed then Austria was the logical source from which to secure supplies of such arms . For the purposes of these pages , " Montenegrin " revolvers are large , gate-loaded , rod-ejecting , double-action revolvers which , though solidframed and of heavy calibre , appear unduly frail in construction . They have the " broom handle " butt and lock-mechanism of that Model 1870 ? 74 Gasser weapon shown at Plate 7 , and are usually decorated with bone grips , coarsely engraved or chiselled frames @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used in them is ( save that it was centre-fire ) disputed amongst collectors today , and variously described as of If , 1175 or 12 mm. calibre . For many years , however , Kynoch Ltd. catalogued a " ? 44 Revolver ( Montenegrin Model ) " cartridge , with 30 grains of black powder propelling a 300 grain solid lead bullet , and the fact that an ammunition manufacturer of ' that status  | should list such a round until as late as 1926 suggests ( to this writer , at any rate ) that a large number of " Montenegrin " revolvers must have been chambered for it . Today , the most sought-after " Montenegrin " model is a 34-lb. ( 1475 g. ) , six-shot monster shown at Plate 8 , measuring 15 inches ( 375 mm. ) overall , and with a g4-in. ( 232-mm. ) barrel ; markings are profuse , and may embrace " Guss-Stahl " , " Akers Patent " , " Kaiser 's Patent " , or " Rast &; Gasser " , amongst others , but normally always include the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Montenegrino " . Another version has only five chambers , and measures I o inches ( 250 mm. ) overall , with a 5-in . ( I25-mm. ) barrel ; markings here may include the words " Extra Montenegrino " , " Guss-Stahl " , " Excelsior " , and " S. Marke " , together with the legend " L. Gasser , Wien , Ottakring , Patent " . A third ( six-chambered ) version , of similar dimensions to the second , is illustrated by Blair , who notes the same markings as allied with a crown over letters " N.I . " . BELGIAN revolvers As later remarks upon M. DOZIN , L. NAGANT , H. PIEPER , and PIRLOT &; TRESART ( q.v. ) should confirm , the Belgian firearms industry was heavily concentrated , in or around the town of Liege , and it was of surprising size for such a small country . The Liege manufacturing pattern was confused , in that part of the trade was in the hands of firms ( like those mentioned in remarks upon L. NAGANT , q.v. ) who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( dominated by such houses as Freres Dumoulin et Cie , Raick Freres , or Theate Freres ) consisted of factors and merchants , who maintained warehouse premises rather than factories . The latter sold firearms , but occupied themselves also in arranging the necessary manufacture ( from components which they supplied ) by independent craftsmen , who carried out the various processes of filing , assembly , or finishing , often by hand , in their own homes . Indeed , even true factories frequently used the services of these out-workers for certain products , with some weapons entering and leaving their premises as many as thirty times ( for the attention of various outside specialists ) before completion . Due to the effect of increasing mechanization upon Liege ( from the late 189os ) , it is impossible , in the compass of these notes , to detail that course followed by revolver manufacturers during our whole period . Clearly , however , when taken with the Belgian manufacturer or merchant 's normal intention to supply improved models , as frequently and as cheaply as possible , the system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolvers for those markets which it served . Indeed ,  | that outlay ( for adapting machine tools ) or simple factory-floor disorganization which would , for example , have deterred any large American manufacturer amongst those mentioned in Chapter I , from producing non-standard models in any but a production-run involving hundreds of arms , barely existed for a Belgian manufacturer or merchant . Foundries at Herstal ( a Liege suburb ) made components for a variety of industries , and would both manufacture rough revolver parts from foundry patterns or forging dies supplied by their customers , and treat cast material to make it malleable enough for filing . If necessary , these establishments were fully equipped to machine and bore cylinders , lock-frames , or barrels ( although the latter would be rifled , elsewhere , by firms or craftsmen specializing in that trade ) , so that the principal could pass amongst his chosen out-workers , revolver components in a wide range of production stages , and leave to hand-work those details of barrel length , shaping of frames , and so forth , which machine tools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms . Even by American standards , the output of Belgian revolvers was respectably large , having regard to those diffused methods of manufacture used in many cases , and Cmd. 2683 ? 14 mentions ( but does not break down , by type ) an average annual Liege revolver and self-loading pistol output of about 500,000 weapons , the figures for 1904 being 549,669 , and those for 1905 , 629,376 . Moreover , it is no exaggeration to say that Liege both could and would supply revolvers of almost any pattern and quality , to almost any market in the world where such imports were permitted at all , and in rim- , pin- , or centre-fire embodiments . Plate 9 shows one British firm 's range of the cheapest Belgian revolvers and , bearing in mind that prices shown include both the Liege supplier 's margin and Chas . Osborne &; Co. ' s mark-up , it will be appreciated how cheaply such arms could be produced in Liege , around 1900 it is significant that the same catalogue features only one American revolver of this type , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far better quality . The lock-mechanism used in Belgian revolvers of that kind shown at Plate g , was double-action , normally embodied a hammer-rebound , and was almost the ultimate in simplicity , as may be seen at Figure 13 ; here , " p " is the hammer , " r " the trigger ( on which the pawl " m " is pivoted ) and " s " a hammer rebound ; in self-cocking fire , " p " is lifted by " r " acting on the hammercatch ( pivoted in the breast of " p " ) , until it escapes and falls to fire a cartridge , whilst in single-action fire , thumbing back " p " rocks the trigger " r " to the rear ( by engagement of trigger-nose with hammertoe ) until the nose of the trigger engages a bent cut at the toe of the  | hammer , to hold " p " at full-cock until " r " is pressed . When " r " is released , after double- or single-action firing , the trigger-spring rocks " r " forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fitted , this movement ( since " r " rubs against " s " , as it moves forward ) raises the rear end of the rebound which , in turn , presses against the heel of the hammer , and turns this back off the cartridges . As will be noted , by reference to Plate 9 , such pistols were offered in small calibres , and another weapon in this category ( though of marginally better quality ) is shown at Plate 6 ( lower ) , and known to modern collectors as the " Velo Dog " model ; Spanish competition for the figure N.B. All springs have been omitted to isolate the main components . market in these arms was keen enough to be felt even by Belgian manufacturers , and although such concealed-hammer , self-cocking , solidframed , rod-ejecting pocket revolvers were normally chambered for that long 5.5 mm. centre-fire cartridge after which the model was named , versions were also offered in other small-calibre centre-fire chamberings . Another line of arms , with which the Belgian and Spanish makers competed for African and South American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large size ; these models ( some of which were in calibres as heavy as 15 mm. ) were of an obsolete pattern first introduced in the 186os . Liege also produced hinged-frame self-ejecting and swing-out cylinder revolvers during our period , although it was with the first  | mentioned that the factories really excelled , prior to 1914 ; swing-out cylinder designs then tended to be limited to such arms as the French M/1892 service revolver shown at Plate 14 ( or to Pieper and Nagant arms mentioned in Chapter IV ) , although a few " hammerless " pocket weapons of undistinguished type were produced . Many Belgian hinged frame self-ejecting revolvers were literal copies of Smith &; Wesson " Double Action " ( see Plate 5 ) , " New Navy " or " New Departure " ( see Plate 36 ) lines described in Chapter I , whilst others were copies of that " Pryse " weapon ( with press-button tong barrel-latch ) illustrated at Plate 24 ( lower ) ; however , smaller hinged-frame revolvers , with folding triggers , had no extensively manufactured American or British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms similar to solidframed Austrian " Montenegrin " types described above . The latter were also copied at Liege ( complete with their distinctive Gasser lockmechanism , as shown at Plate 8 ) , and such hinged-frame self-ejecting variants normally used that tong barrel-latch popularized in " Pryse " revolvers . However , a model produced by Auguste Francotte &; Cie had the barrel hinged to the top of the standing breech , and operated its ejector automatically , when the barrel was unlatched and tipped backwards over the holder 's fist . Finally , of course , service revolvers were also manufactured in Belgium , both for the armed forces of that State , and for use by countries lacking any arms industry of their own . By 1914 , the Belgian cavalry and gendarmerie had been issued with a Browning , Model 1900 , self-loading pistol ( in 7.65 m/m. calibre ) , but service revolvers were then still retained in issue by the artillery , and consisted of Model 1878 , Model 1883 , and Model 1878 ? 86 arms ; all were well-made , six-shot , solid-framed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with 12.2 g. lead bullets and a charge of 1 gramme of fine-grain artillery black powder ) , having 5s-inch. ( 140-mm. ) octagonal barrels , rifled by four grooves twisted to the left , and weighing just over 2 lb. ( 950 g. ) when unloaded . The Model 1878 pistol had originally been issued as an officer 's sidearm , with rod-ejector , take-down , and frame-construction details patented by Emile Nagant ; see , for example , his British patent No. 4310 ( of 22nd October , 1879 ) , which had expired in 1882 . The Model 1878 double-action lock-mechanism is shown as Figure 14 , and there compared with the Model 1883 single-action lockmechanism subsequently developed from it ; the latter was a rather unusual single-action lock-mechanism , in that the hammer rebounded slightly , after discharge . The double-action Model 1878 ? 86 lock-mechanism design also had  | a hammer-rebound , and had been arrived at by eliminating five components from the Model 1878 lock-mechanism ( namely , sear , searspring , trigger-spring , pawl-spring , and mainspring stirrup ) , and by using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been done with Model 1883 revolvers ; it became internationally popular , and is shown at Figure 19 , in a form used in Scandinavian service revolvers . In addition to providing the above-mentioned arms for issue to Belgian troops , Liege also manufactured a Nagant " gas-seal " design ( described in Chapter IV ) , which was taken up by the Russian armed forces , and from time to time supplied more conventional weapons to Argentina , Brazil , Denmark , Norway , Portugal , Romania , Serbia , and Sweden . Inquiry of South American military museums failed to elicit any information about the Argentinian or Brazilian arms ; however , these are known to have been a ? 44 calibre centre-fire Nagant design , which this writer assumes to have been almost identical to the Belgian Model 1878 ? 86 revolver ( or with those Norwegian M/1893-Swedish M/1887 arms shown at Plates 17 and 21 ) , and therefore to have had that lock-mechanism shown at Figure 19.  | DANISH revolvers Denmark appears to have had no native manufacturer of civilian revolvers , but ( whilst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have fostered a small production of service arms in at least one government arsenal . In 1910 , the Danish Army adopted a 9-mm . Bergmann self-loading pistol , which was actually produced by the Anciens Etablissements Pieper , S.A. ( see H. PIEPER ) , at Herstal , in Belgium , but until that date the side-arm issue consisted almost exclusively of Model 1865 and Model 1865/97 revolvers , in obsolete patterns . The first-named was a single-action " Lefaucheux-Francotte " 11-mm. pin-fire weapon ( with a solid frame and rod-ejector ) shown in Plate 1 o ( top ) ; the pistol so illustrated is actually the later Model 1865/97 ( converted from pin- to centre-fire at the Danish Kronborg Gevaerfabrik ) , but otherwise identical to the first design . In either embodiment , these revolvers measured just over 1 o inches ( 255 mm. ) in length , had 5 *-in. ( 128-mm. ) barrels , and weighed just under 2 lb. ( 87o g. ) when unloaded . It is probable , however , that more modern revolvers were tested by the Danish Army , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improved Nagant designs ( like those shown in Plate 17 ) predominating . In addition ( the Danish Army Museum has stated , in correspondence with an American collector ) several hundred double-action solidframed 9-mm. revolvers were actually made at Kronborg , in and after 188o ; these weapons had " Schmidt-Galand " lock-mechanisms ( see , for examples , Figs. 12 or 33 ) , and were most beautifully made . Specimen arms are , however , very rare today . Danish naval revolvers of our period are shown at Plate 10 ( lower ) , as the Model 1871 ? 81 and Model 1891 revolvers . The first of these may be seen to have both the lock-mechanism and appearance of a GasserKropatschek revolver shown at Plate 7 ( lower ) , but began life as a pinfire revolver , and was subsequently converted , at the Copenhagen dockyard , to that 11-mm. centre-fire model shown ; issue arms were marked upon the barrel " A. Francotte a Liege " ( in recognition of their source ) , measured about 10 inches ( 257 mm. ) in length , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 lb. ( 970 g. ) unloaded . The M/1891 revolver ( which the Tojhusmuseet credits also to Francotte , but which Dr. Arne Hoff ascribes to J. B. Ronge fils , another Liege house ) was a double-action , hinged-frame , self-ejecting revolver , of 9-mm. centre-fire calibre , based upon a Belgian commercial weapon that is known to modern collectors as the " Le Vaux " arm , in recognition of a name frequently found upon specimens ; the hall-round and  | half-octagonal barrel , and lever-safety , of Model 1891 Danish naval arms are not features of the Le Vaux version , and were presumably specified by the purchasing authority . M/1891 pistols measure about to inches ( 26o mm. ) overall , have 51-in. ( 137-mm. ) barrels , and weigh under 2 lb. ( 900 g. ) unloaded . DUTCH revolvers Civilian revolvers with Dutch markings are uncommon in British collections , and those few observed by this writer appeared ( from proof-marks ) to be of Belgian origin ; indeed , the first service revolvers issued to any Dutch forces had been imported from Liege @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relevant to our own period were of native manufacture , namely , " Model 1873 " revolvers ( produced in five versions , at the de Beaumont factory , in Maastricht ) and the less common " KNIL Model 1891 " pistol . Model 1873 revolvers were used by both army and navy , and are called " Chamelot-Delvigne type " revolvers in Holland ; such a practice underlines that risk implicit in use of unofficial names for service weapons , since ( apart from being also solid-framed , double-action , gateloaded , centre-fire arms ) Dutch Model 1873 pistols have nothing in common with , for example , French service revolvers to which a " Chamelot Delvigne " name is commonly applied . Thus the Dutch weapon is in 9.4 mm. calibre , has no attached rod-ejector , and uses a Nagant M/1878 lock-mechanism shown at Figure 14 , whilst French M/ 1873 and M/1874 arms are in 11-mm. calibre , embody attached rod-ejectors , and have that lock-mechanism sketched at Figure 15 ; the dissimilar appearance of these Dutch and French arms may also be noted , by reference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , respectively . Plate 11 illustrates the original " OM " ( Old Model ) Dutch M/1873 revolver below , together with three variants later issued and being , in order of ascent , the " NM " ( New Model ) , the " Kl.M . " ( " Klein " , or Small Model ) , and an arm " voor traangaspatronen " , using tear-gas cartridges ; the " OM " , " NM " and Kl.M. " weapons ( all in 9.4-mm. centre-fire calibre ) were distinct patterns , but a " K.S.O. " ( " Kamer schietoefening " or Indoor Shooting Model , in 6-mm . Flobert rim-fire calibre ) and tear-gas pistols may have been produced by modification to standard arms available , by breakage or otherwise , for use in such a manner . The " OM " revolver weighed about 25 lb. ( 1300 g. ) unloaded , had a 6-in. ( 161-mrn. ) barrel , and measured 11 inches ( 28o mm. ) overall ; although having a lock-mechanism similar to one used , in due course , for Belgian M/1878 arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ingenious Nagant take-down system adopted  | by the Belgians ( and shown in Figure 14 ) so that a large detachable side-plate gave access to their lock-components . In all versions relevant here , the Dutch revolver depended upon use of a separate rod , carried on the holster , for removal of cartridge-cases from their chambers . The " KNIL Model 1891 " revolver is shown at Plate If , and was issued only to the Netherlands Colonial Army . It was also in 9.4-mm. centre-fire calibre , weighed 1.8 lb. ( 825 g. ) unloaded , had a 42-in. ( 113-mm. ) barrel rifled with four grooves , and measured 85 inches ( 222 mm. ) overall ; as may be seen from Plate 11 and Figure 12 , the double action lock-mechanism was of that " Schmidt-Galand " pattern , mentioned in earlier remarks upon Austrian M/1898 revolvers , and an attached rod-ejector and improved take-down system were other features of a weapon greatly superior to that issued for Dutch home forces . It would appear that defects in the Model 1873 design were recognized , since Nagant revolvers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms shown at Plates 17 and 21 ) were tested by a Netherlands ordnance commission , but not adopted . Both basic patterns of Dutch service revolver were over-large for police-issue , and a lighter weapon ( of similar appearance to P1493 on Plate 9 ) was developed for that purpose . Chambering a 9.4-mm. centre-fire cartridge , such pistols are practically indistinguishable in appearance from a number of " Bull Dog " or " Constabulary " revolvers produced by the Belgian gun-trade , and were probably manufactured at Liege . Occasionally , this pattern of Dutch police arm will be found to have the 1-in. barrel designed for use with tear-gas cartridges . FRENCH revolvers During our period , French military thinking appears to have been against issue of handguns to its officers and troops , save in cases where ( by the nature of their duties ) personnel would otherwise have been quite unarmed without such a weapon ; the sabre was as a cavalryman 's primary arm ( use of which required any user 's full attention ) , whilst officers should concentrate upon directing their men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Navy ( which had , in 1854 , pioneered the issue of service revolvers to French " other ranks " ) had to retain in service , after 1889 , designs then several decades old , and could only augment such supplies with those models from time to time issued by the Army . By 1889 , such Army revolvers were of 1 1-mm. centre-fire calibre , and issued in solid-framed , rod-ejecting double-action six-shot Model 1873 and Model 1874 versions , the former to troops and the latter for officers only ; both models are popularly described as " Chamelot Delvigne "  | revolvers but , for reasons indicated with remarks upon Dutch service revolvers also called " Chamelot Delvigne " , use of that title should be avoided . Since it is less commonly seen , a Model 1874 revolver is illustrated at Plate 12 ( lower ) , but differs from the Model 1873 pistol only in minor detail ; thus the Model 1874 cylinder was fluted ( where a shorter Model 1873 component had a plain forward circumference ) , the metal was chemically-coloured ( where troopers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and rather more care was taken over the finish and fitting of parts for the officers ' version . In both cases , however , the lock-mechanism was that shown at Figure 15 , and was both well-made and reliable . Double-action lock-mechanism for French M/1873 and M/1874 service revolvers . In Figure 15 , " a " is the hammer ( which has a projecting tooth on its breast ) , " b " the trigger , carrying on a common pivot both the pawl " c " and the lifter " d " ( which latter engages the toothed hammer-breast , as shown , when " at rest " ) , and " e " is the sear . During self-cocking fire , pressure on " b " raises " a " by engagement of " d " with the hammerbreast ( and causes " c " to rotate the cylinder ) , until " a " escapes from the lifter and falls on to a cartridge ; at that moment when " a " escapes from the lifter " d " , the sear " e " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hammer , by a surface at the rear of the trigger . In single-action fire , " a " drags " h " to the rear ( by its engagement with the lifter " d " ) , thus causing " c " to rotate the cylinder , until " e " engages bents on the U  | under side of " a " , to hold it at half- or full-cock , as desired . Pressure on " b " , at full-cock , then disengages " e " from the hammer-bents , and " a " falls , as before . In either case , a trigger-spring restores the trigger to its forward position after firing , which movement drags down " d " , to re-engage the hammer-breast . Model 1873 revolvers measured some 93 inches ( 242 mm. ) overall and weighed about 25 lb. ( 1,195 g. ) unloaded ; Model 1874 revolvers measured just over 9 inches ( 239 mm. ) overall , but weighed substantially less , at around 1 u lb. ( 900 g. ) when unloaded . In either version , barrel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and specimen arms observed by this writer were marked " Mre d'Armes St. Etienne " , on their frames , and serially-numbered ; in a high proportion of observed cases , this serial-number was prefixed by a capital letter , which suggested that a global serial-range was not allocated to either model . During most of our period , such arms ( marked with an anchor ) were also issued to the French Navy and marines , as earlier mentioned . The oiginal cartridge had a low muzzle-velocity , and an improved Model 73 ? 90 round ( boosting that velocity from 140 m. /sec. to 190 m. /sec. ) was introduced , possibly based upon a naval cartridge with heavier charge of black powder . In 1885 , a new 11-mm. revolver was studied , and an example is shown as Plate 13 ( top ) ; this was still a rod-ejecting solid-framed arm ( like the M/1873 or M/1874 weapons ) , though of lighter construction , and details of the lock-mechanism embodied in it are not known . This revolver was probably designed to the wishes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommending a new service-issue sidearm , but was not adopted , the Committee instead transferring its official attention to another solid-framed rod-ejecting design , namely , the Model 1887 pistol shown at Plate 13 ( lower ) ; this pattern was issued for field tests , in limited numbers , and , in line with some military thinking of those days , was in much smaller calibre ( 8 mm. centre-fire ) than any predecessor . Save for its ejector-rod , pierced trigger-guard , lever safety-catch ( on the left of the action-body ) , and frame-mounted firing-pin ( visible in Plate 13 ) , this Model 1887 pistol was externally a quite close copy of that Swiss Model 1882 revolver shown at Plate 20 ( top ) , although it is not known whether the lock-mechanism used in it was actually that design embodied in the Swiss arm . It was not adopted , the Committee eventually approving a Model 1892 pistol . This French Model 1892 service revolver is shown at Plate 14 ( top ) , and is today sometimes mistakenly called a " Lebel " revolver ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a noted small-arms authority of the French Army , and actually did have a military rifle ( the Model 1886 )  | named in honour of his chairmanship of that Rifle Test Board which introduced it , but he had resigned his commission before the Model 1892 revolver was adopted , and there is real doubt if he contributed to such adoption . As may be noted from Plate 14 , the Model 1892 revolver was a sixchambered double-action revolver ( which chambered 8-mm. centrefire cartridges , propelling 12o-grain copper jacketed bullets at around 625 f.p.s. ) , but although solid-framed , was a swing-out cylinder design of that type mentioned in earlier remarks upon Colt or Smith &; Wesson arms . However , its crane-mounted cylinder swung out to the right of the frame , for loading or cartridge ejection , and not ( as in the American manner ) to the left . It weighed about I lb. 14 oz. ( 84o g. ) unloaded , had a 4-in. ( loo-mm. ) barrel , rifled with four grooves , and measured about 82 inches ( 239 mm. ) overall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lever on the right of the frame , which disconnected hammer from trigger when turned back ( in that fashion later described for Portuguese " Abadie " revolvers ) , and the whole left-hand side-plate could be opened , on a forward pivot , to give access to the lock-components for cleaning or repair . The double-action lock-mechanism ( which is sketched as Figure 16 ) was very similar to that Model 1889 Italian service revolver lock-mechanism shown in Plate 16 ( lower ) ; however , although of considerably better execution , this French design did lack an important safety-feature noticed in relation to the Italian arm . In Figure 16 , " a " is the hammer , " d " the trigger , " g " the pawl , and " k " the mainspring ; there are no separate pawl- or trigger-springs , since " k " ( by engaging a slot at the inner side of " g " , which is itself pivoted on " d " ) serves both functions , in addition to that of mainspring ; in either " at rest " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by engagement with those protuberances and notches visible in Plate 14 . The sequence of events in both self-cocking and single-action fire is virtually identical to that described for the " Schmidt-Galand " lockmechanism in Figure 4 , but with the mainspring here functioning exactly as if it were a " mainspring auxiliary " shown in that Figure . Most observed specimens of the Model 1892 revolver shared with their predecessors the use of a letter-prefixed serial number , making it difficult to estimate those quantities likely to have been produced ; M. josserand has , however , established that 176,103 revolvers of this pattern were made from 1892 to 1900 , inclusive . They are noted as issued to officers , by Bornecque , and were also apparently used by naval or marine personnel . I n addition to the service version , a model " de Saint-Etienne " was also studied , and is shown at Plate 14 ( lower ) ; this  | rare version is sometimes called the model " a pompe " , and used a cylinder-latching system similar to that described in relation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( q.v. ) , where the ejectorrod was pulled forward to free the cylinder for swinging out of the frame . The French small-arms industry was a large one , with Tulle ( a town in the Correze Department ) , for example , almost economically dependent upon one factory there , and substantial manufacturing centres at Double-action lock-mechanism of the French Modele d'Ordonnance 1892 service revolver . St. Etienne and Chatellerault , in the Loire and Vienne Departments , respectively , where both State and private production were carried on . However , revolvers of certain French manufacture are quite rare in both British and American collections , and it is very difficult to judge the extent to which such arms were commercially produced in France . Many weapons with the name of a French retailer prove , upon examination , to have been made in Belgium , and foreign-made copies of the Model 1892 service revolver were available , from Belgian or Spanish manufacturers , to such an extent that it is difficult to regard any appreciable part of the French small-arms manufacturing potential as occupied in this field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( with reference to W. DECKER , K. l ) OI3SI.AW and P. SCHMIDT , the GRUSONWERK A. G. , M. IIASSELMANN , II . LANGENHAN , P. P. MAUSER , E. PAUL ,  | R. TARGAN and the W. T. G. " WESPI " , and G. TRESENREUTER ) , German applicants for British patents relevant to this Chapter form an appreciable part of the total , but their own country actually contributed nothing of real value to revolver design , during our period . The best German hand-gun designers ( and there were none better ) concentrated instead upon self-loading pistols during most of that period , and a large small-arms industry seems to have left us nothing relevant ( and made between 1889 and 1914 ) , save one pattern of service revolver , some pin-fire arms , a variety of sound hinged-frame selfejecting copies of Smith &; Wesson designs , and quantities of cheap solid-framed , rod-ejecting , pocket revolvers , similar to weapons shown at Plate 6 ( lower ) and 9 . The German Model 1884 service revolver , for officers , shown in Plate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( chambering six 1o ? 6-mm. centre-fire cartridges ) , with an overall length of 105 inches ( 26o mm. ) , an unloaded weight of just over 2 lb. ( 96o g. ) , and a 42-in. ( 118-mm. ) barrel , rifled with four grooves twisted to the right ; the Model 188o pistol , for troopers , was similar ( see Plate 15 ; lower ) , although larger and of coarser workmanship , with an overall length of 135 inches ( 34o mm. ) an unloaded weight of almost 3 lb. ( 1320 g. ) , and a 7k-in. ( 18o-mm. ) barrel with heavy muzzle-ring . Neither Model 188o nor 1884 arms were fitted with an attached ejector ( the arbor serving that function , when removed from its seat ) , but both had a lever safety-catch ( on the left ) which bolted the hammer " at rest " , or in the half-cock position . The names of several makers appear upon both models , and it is believed that all were manufactured between the Erfurt Arsenal , on the one hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Gebr . Mauser &; Co. ( at Oberndorf ) , or Sauer &; Son , V. Chas . Schilling , &; C. G. Haenel , at Suhl . Serial-numbers appear to be uniformly low on Model 188o weapons ( no such number seen by this writer has exceeded 1 0000 ) , suggesting that a global serial-range was never allocated to them , but a Model 1884 pistol has been noted with a number as high as 45915 . Commonly , both models are dated and several specimens marked " Erfurt " were dated as late as 1894 . However , the German armed forces began to adopt Borchardt-Luger self-loading pistols , in and after 1900 , when these revolvers were withdrawn to police and reserve service . The lock-mechanism used in both Model 188o and 1884 arms was simple and reliable ; flat springs served the hammer and trigger , and the vulnerable pawl-spring ( working against a flat surface formed on the pawl-pivot ) was buried in the slotted hammer-breast . As may be seen in Figure 17 , a rocking cylinder-bolt was operated by the trigger , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tilt that bolt from engagement with the cylinder locking-notches . ITALIAN revolvers The Italian armed forces were issued with two basic patterns of solid-framed double-action rod-ejecting revolver , during most of those years between 1889 and 1914 ; both were six-chambered weapons , in 1o ? 35-mm. centre-fire calibre , and respectively named the " Model 1874 , Chamelot Delvigne " ( a pistol very similar in appearance to the French arm on Plate 12 ; lower ) , and the " Model 1889 , system Bodeo " shown in Plate 16 . Single-action lock-mechanism for German M/1880 and M/r884 service revolvers . N.B. Main- , trigger- , and cylinder-bolt springs have been omitted . As its name suggests , the Model 1874 weapon had a prior history in Italian hands , having been manufactured in no less than three slightly different versions ( the " Glisenti " , the " Pirlot " , and the " Brescian " ) , prior to August , 1888 ; at that time , a somewhat lighter pattern was formally substituted for the earlier ones , but it seems probable that this merely saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ' cavalry officers , N.C.O.s , certain transport personnel , and with the Carabinicri . Since most military text-books give dimensions apparently correct only for pre-1888 models , it is difficult to be certain , but this writer believes that even the improved Model 1874 revolver was a heavy pistol , weighing 2:3 lb. ( 1,134 g. ) unloaded , and measuring 11 inches ( 279 nn. ) overall , with a 6i-in. ( 156-Him. ) octagonal barrel ,  | rifled with four grooves twisted to the right ; in all cases , however , the double-action lock-mechanism was identical to a French version shown at Figure 15 , and was sufficiently well executed to ensure that reliability implicit in its design . The Model 1889 revolver shown at Plate 16 ( top ) was originally issued ( on 3rd June , 1891 ) to officers in the medical services , Army , and Carabinieri ; in 1906 , however , Carabinieri officers received instead a Model 1905 ( Haensler-Roch ) self-loading pistol and , in 1911 , all Army officers were issued similar Glisenti arms . As a result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the hands of load-bearing " Other Ranks " in the Italian armies , such as tripod- or ammunition-carriers in machinegun sections , and sanitary orderlies or stretcher-bearers . It was a less substantial arm than any Model 1874 pistol , weighing just over 2 lb. ( 910 g. ) , measuring just over 94 inches ( 235 mm. ) in length , and with a 4-in. ( 114-mm. ) octagonal barrel rifled by four grooves twisted to the right . Although coarsely executed in a version shown at Plate 16 ( lower ) , the lock-mechanism was so thoroughly satisfactory in use that it was virtually copied for the French Model 1892 service revolver ( in relation to which the cycle of its operation is indicated ) , but was apparently of quite elderly parentage . The point may never be finally settled but , save that it used a hammer-catch ( i.e. that component hinged to the hammer-breast , for use in self-cocking fire ) , the Model 1889 Italian service revolver lock-mechanism appears to this writer as having been anticipated , in every material detail , by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in 1875 ) , which is the principal subject of later notes upon O. JONES ( q.v. ) and A. T. DE MOUNCIE ( q.v. ) , and which was the basis for a mechanism used in Swiss M/1878 arms . However , although the Model 1889 weapon also embodied one safety-device copied from another earlier pistol ( where the loading-gate pivot served as a hammer-disconnector , in that fashion shown in Figure 18 , for Portuguese " Abadie " revolvers ) , it was not wholly derivative , and had another safety-feature unique in European service revolvers of this period , namely , a hammer-block . This component ( visible in Plate 16 ; lower ) , might be mistaken for a pawl-spring , on casual inspection , since it is jointed to the rear of the pawl ; however , the purpose which it actually serves is to ride between hammer and frame ( preventing the former from reaching the cartridges ) until the trigger has been pressed as far to the rear as it can possibly go . When this position is:reached , the rising paw has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relieving notch in the left side of the hammer ( see Plate 16 ; lower ) , so that when the hammier falls it can now reach a cartridge . Accidental  | blows upon the hammer , or mishaps in cocking , will no more discharge this revolver than such accidents with a Colt revolver of that type shown at Figure 5 . Model 1889 revolvers were made at several factories , normally had a letter-prefixed serial number , and may be dated ; the better-known factory-markings are those of " Castelli " ( at Brescia ) , the " Fabbrica d'Armi Brescia " , the " Metallurgica , Bresciana " , the " Siderurgica Glisenti " ( at Turin ) , and the " Royal Fabrica d'Armi Glisenti " , at Brescia . An improved " Glisenti Model 1894 " version of the Model 1889 pistol is listed by several authorities , and believed ( by this writer ) to be a version with trigger-guard ; however , revolvers with the distinctive folding-trigger of the 1889 design will be found bearing dates decades later than 1914 , so that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolvers Individual private possession was on a scale sufficient for each Japanese prefecture to maintain an official register of firearms within its borders , and hand-guns may be assumed to have formed an appreciable part of any total , but the Imperial armed forces took no precipitate action to adopt and issue such weapons . True , the Navy had purchased more than six hundred Smith &; Wesson " No. 3 , New Model " revolvers ( see Chapter I ) in 1879 and 1887 , but a naval pistol of native manufacture or design was not issued during our period ; ( by a Nambu self-loading pistol ) in 1914 , and it would appear that no general commercial manufacture of revolvers occurred in Japan , as a result of such adoption . The Japanese Army revolver is shown at Plate 19 ( lower ) , and was known as the " 26th Year " Model , in recognition that 1893 ( the year of its adoption ) was the twenty-sixth year of that Meiji era then current by the Japanese calendar . It was a six-shot , hinged-frame , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a study of desirable features in sundry Western arms . Thus , the self-cocking lock-mechanism was based upon a Continental " Schmidt-Galand " double-action design then used in British , Austrian , and Dutch service revolvers , take-down details had been pioneered by Emile Nagant , a Belgian , in 1879 , and both barrel-latch and cylinder-retainer designs were culled from Smith &; Wesson devices ( patented during 1877 ) used in the Imperial Navy 's " No. 3 , New Model " pistols . Save that its large hinged side-plate did make it easier to service than any other hinged-frame self ejecting service revolver , the " 26th Year "  | pistol was a poor weapon , badly manufactured . As issued , it measured about 82 inches ( 212.5 mm. ) overall , had a 4io-inch ( 117-mm. ) barrel , yet weighed 2 lb. 4 oz. ( 1,020 g. ) unloaded . Although the cartridge had a fairly authoritative muzzle-velocity ( at 750 f.p.s. ) , accurate shooting was difficult with the self-cocking lock-mechanism , particularly in the hands of cavalry , to whom it was largely issued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) listed an 8-mm . " Carabine Mourata " , Model 1894 long-arm as the Japanese service weapon of self-defence , and mentioned this revolver not at all . NORWEGIAN revolvers As was the case with Denmark , Norway depended heavily upon imported revolvers to arm troops issued with such weapons , but also maintained a small State manufacturing-capability within its own borders ; it is believed , however , that no civilian manufacture of any significance occurred during our period . Norwegian service revolvers in issue by 1914 ( when they were augmented by purchase , and subsequent manufacture , of the Colt M/191I self-loading pistol ) consisted largely of " Model 1893 " solidframe , double-action , rod-ejecting arms , chambering six 7.5-mm. centre-fire cartridges ; however , it is probable that earlier issues were represented by surviving specimens of " Model 1883 " , " Model 1864/ 1898 " , or even " Model 1864 " arms . Model 1864 revolvers were 11-mm. pin-fire weapons , largely purchased from France during 1864 ( in both single- and double-action versions ) , but also manufactured on a small scale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1864 ? 1898 pistols were modified survivors of the earlier model , in which their open frames had been bridged , with top-strap reinforcements , giving them a similar external appearance to that Swedish " Lefaucheux-Francotte " model shown at Plate 21 ( top ) . Model 1883 weapons were substantial , solid-frame , rod-ejecting revolvers ( in 9-mm. centre-fire calibre ) , of which nearly 800 had been purchased from the Liege factory of Emile Nagant ( see L. NAGANT ) , in both double- and single-action versions ; save that their cylinders were dimpled , rather than fluted , these weapons were merely Belgian M/1878 and M/1883 service revolvers earlier described . Norwegian Model 1893 service revolvers ( shown at Plate 17 ) had that double-action lock-mechanism shown as Figure 19 , and 12,964 of them were purchased from the factory of L. NAGANT ( q.v. ) , in 1893 ; a small quantity were also produced at the Kongsberg Vapenfabrikk , and 350 more were purchased from the Swedish Husqvarna factory ,  | during 1897 . In Sweden ( as may be seen , by comparing Plates 17 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in issue for some years , as the " Model 1887 " revolver later mentioned , and the 7.5-mm. centre-fire arms supplied to Norway are almost indistinguishable from Swedish issue sidearms ; they may be identified , however , by the acceptance stamps of Norwegian inspectors ( Jacob Maximillian Gran Paaske , and Ole Adolf Julsrud ) impressed upon them with the factory name , or by a pattern of foresight used . Both features are shown at Plate I 7 ( lower ) . PORTUGUESE revolvers Portugal had two " Abadie " service revolvers in issue at 1889 , namely , the Model 1878 ( for officers ) , and the Model 1886 ( for troopers ) , both of which were Belgian-made , solid-framed , rod-ejecting weapons , chambering six 9.1-mm. centre-fire cartridges ; issue of the officer 's model ceased entirely in 1908 ( when a 9-mm . Borchardt-Luger self-loading pistol was adopted as the service sidearm ) , but troopers pistols were then relegated to the Guarda Fiscal , and not finally discarded until many years later . A definite reason for the model-name lies in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the marking " L. Soleil , Liege " is also present . In dimension , these two models were similar only in calibre , and in relation to that four-groove rifling , twisted to the left , which was used in their barrels . The Model 1878 pistol ( shown at Plate 18 ; top ) measured 817-6 inches ( 218 mm. ) overall , had a 41-in. ( 113-mm. ) octagonal barrel , and weighed 1.63 lb. ( 752 g. ) unloaded ; the Model 1886 revolver ( shown at Plate 18 ; lower ) measured about zo inches ( 249 mm. ) overall , had a 51-in. ( 142 mm. ) octagonal barrel , and weighed 1.83 lb. ( 835 g. ) unloaded . The frames were of different weights also , but other more noticeable differences of detail can be seen in the rod-ejector and arbor of these two models , and ( internally ) in the method used for mounting their lock-mechanism ; the latter was , incidentally , of that Model 1878 double-action Nagant design , shown in Figure 14 . An important feature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " revolvers , was a loading-gate safety-device , elsewhere noticed in remarks upon Austrian ( M/1898 ) , French ( M/1892 ) , Italian ( M/1889 ) , and Swiss M/1882 service revolvers . The practical effect of the " Abadie " version ( operation of which is shown at Figure 18 ) was that when the rearward-opening loading-gate was swung back , this action first half=cocked the hammer , and then permitted the trigger to he pressed repeatedly without further cocking the hammer . It was not the ? refinre possible to fire the weapon whilst loading or unloading it , and  | the chambers were rapidly and automatically aligned ( without fumbling ) for loading , or use of the rod-ejector to clear any cartridges in them . In Figure 18 it will be seen that the inner end of the loading-gate pivot extends across the plane of that hinged hammer-catch ( on the hammer-breast ) against which the trigger-nose thrusts to raise the hammer in self-cocking fire . When the loading-gate is open , a cylindrical surface on the pivot forces back the hammer-catch , and pressure on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cylinder , without cocking Fie . 18 . Portuguese " Abadie " loading-gate safety device . ( Drawn by Senhor Joao de Figueiredo. ) the hammer ; when the gate is closed , however , that side of the pivot then opposite the hammer-catch is so shaped that the latter may be reached by the trigger-nose , in normal fashion . ROMANIAN revolvers The Muzeul Militar Central has no information upon the scale of issue ( if any ) to Romanian forces of that native revolver which is described in relation to H. DIMANCEA ( q.v. ) , and illustrated as Figure 39 . It is clear , however , that three different service revolvers ( together with a M/1912 Steyr 8.8-mm. self-loading pistol ) were in the hands of certain Romanian officers and troops , during our period . The most elderly design is shown as Plate 20 ( lower ) , and was known as " Captain Buescu 's revolver , Model 1876 " ; this gate-loaded , solidframed , rod-ejecting , double-action weapon had originally been issued as the " system Galant Lebeau , Model 1874 " ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Captain Buescu 's recommendations . Both Model 1874 and Model 1876 weapons were superseded by issue of the Steyr pistol , Model 1912 , mentioned above .  | In addition , more modern revolvers ( of 8-mm. centre-fire calibre ) were issued under the model-names " system Nagant , Model 1895 " and " system Saint-Etienne , Model 1896 " . The writer has not secured pictures of these Romanian models , but believes them respectively to have been copies of a widely- , circulated Nagant arm ( see , for example , Plate 17 ; top ) and of that French Model 1892 service revolver shown at Plate 14 ; the first was presumably supplied from Liege , but the Model 1892 arms could have been of either French or Belgian origin . RUSSIAN revolvers Appendix II entries ( with the possible exception of that for B. BEHR ) reveal no Russian contribution to that field covered by this Chapter , and the only novel revolver even to be associated with Russia ( between 1889 and 1914 ) was a Nagant " gas-seal " service weapon described in Chapter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wesson single-action , hinged-frame , self-ejecting revolvers ( of an obsolete model purchased , from America , between 1872 and 1878 ) survived in the hands of Russian troops , along with later German copies of them , until well after 1889 . SPANISH revolvers Writing in 1881 , Barado &; Genova had mentioned only one Spanish service revolver of that period , which was a large hinged-frame , selfejecting , single-action Smith &; Wesson pistol , with a detachable carbine-stock and , in view of the Spanish firearms industry then existing , it is tempting to suggest that this weapon was of native manufacture , perhaps by Orbea Hermanos , of Eibar , who were noted copiers of Smith &; Wesson designs . In fact , however , the Springfield firm had supplied such arms for Spanish service , during the 187os , and Parsons records both a shipment of the so-called " New Model Russian " revolver to Cuba , around 1875 , and delivery of 1,000 modified " New Model No. 3 " pistols ( sold as the " Russian Model of 1877 " ) to Spain itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barado &; Genova are markings found upon the earliest version of " Russian Model " Smith &; Wesson revolver ( and not upon either " New Model No. 3 " or " New Model Russian " pistols ) , it is clear that work remains to be done upon the source from and extent to which Spanish forces were armed with revolvers manufactured abroad , at the opening of our period . In one ? case , at least , there was no doubt when ( by Royal Decree , dated ( ith October , 1884 ) a double-action " Smith revolver " , manuIilctured by the ? Orbca Hermanos , was specifically approved for adop-  | tion , and became the Spanish officer 's Model 1885 sidearm at 18th November , 1885 ; according to " un Officier Superieur " ( whose remarks were published in 1894 ) , the trooper 's revolver then was a " Lefaucheux , Model 1883 " , but the details of both weapon and source are wanting . As to civilian revolvers of Spanish manufacture , the chosen anonymity of makers in our period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it difficult to establish the identity of manufacturers active between 1889 and 1914 . Mathews certainly notices weapons from Barcelona , Eibar , Elgoeibar , Ermua , Guernica , Madrid and Zumorraga , but largely in patterns unaltered for whole decades , which could have been produced at almost any time between 1885 and 1935 . The Orbea Hermanos earlier noticed , and Esprin Hermanos ( using the variously-spelled " Euskaro " trade-name , at Eibar ) , are certainly producers relevant to these pages , but other identities remain to be verified . Like their counterparts at Liege , Spanish makers could produce almost any pattern of revolver , and so inexpensively as to compete with the Belgian producers even at their cheapest levels of production . The Spaniards appear to have used rather more hand-work than the larger Liege manufacturers of our period , and to have had a smaller annual output ; total figures are difficult to find , but Artifex &; Opifex have provided annual-production figures for Eibar only , as 56,370 revolvers made in 1889 , 67,664 in 189o , 65,434 in 1891 , 66,1 o @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a generality , it is true to say that most Spanish commercial revolvers of our period were not of the best quality , and that extensive use of cast-iron components ( in association with obsolete proof rules ) made some of the cheapest weapons actually dangerous to their owners . However , prompted by some undoubtedly vile pistols supplied to meet the First World War demands , criticism of Spanish hand-gun workmanship has undoubtedly been carried to extremes . Since the French officer class never hesitated to carry Spanish sidearms , even under the most severe conditions , since considerable markets for them long existed in Africa or South America , and since so many specimens have survived to this day , it must be accepted that ( in all save the cheapest grades ) Spanish revolvers were at least as safe in use as their Belgian or American equivalents , though sometimes not as reliable . For a more specific and justified criticism , however , it can be said that all models relevant to our period were copied from the designs of other countries , and that Spanish manufacturers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adapting the mechanisms of others into forms acceptable to an industry using a high proportion of hand-work . Double-action solid-framed revolvers , with swing-out cylinders and manual ejectors , did not appear in substantial quantities until after 1914 , but a few lines externally almost identical in appearance to Smith &; Wesson arms of this type were produced ; internally , however , these 8-mm. weapons did not normally follow the American lockmechanism shown at Figure If , but instead used a design adapted from that ( shown at Plate 16 ; lower ) used in Italian M/1889 and French M/1892 service arms . Double-action or self-cocking hinged-frame self-ejecting arms were similarly based upon the Smith &; Wesson " Double Action " ( see Plate 5 ; lower ) , " New Navy " , or " New Departure " models described in Chapter I ; these were available in all the principal centre-fire calibres , and in poor qualities . An unattractive sales ploy , practised by certain makers , was the use upon these arms of a barrel-legend calculated to make the gullible ( or illiterate ) buyer believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Smith &; Wesson cartridges are those that are best for the Euscharo Revolver " , " S. &; W. Cartridges to be used for this Revolver " , or ( upon a self-styled " Model 1909 " copy of the Smith &; Wesson Safety Hammerless arm ) " Smith &; Wesson 's Cartridges are Those Best Suite the Euskara Revolver " , are examples . As to solid-framed , rod-ejecting revolvers , the principal types produced were of either double-action " Bull Dog " and " Constabulary " patterns , similar to that shown as Plate 22 ( top ) , or smaller self-cocking , concealed hammer " Velo Dog " models , with folding triggers , like that in Plate 6 ( lower ) ; the former were made in a variety of chamberings , the latter commonly in that 5.5-mm. centre-fire calibre peculiar to them , but occasionally for other small cartridges . In addition , pin-fire revolvers , of obsolete types , were made for certain South American countries where such arms remained fashionable . SWEDISH revolvers During 1871 , Sweden had adopted the single-action , 11-mm. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 21 ( top ) , and this weapon remained in issue , with selected personnel , for a considerable period of time ; thus , the Kungl . Armemuseum reports , it was still carried by sergeants and dismounted gunners , signallers , and medical or ambulance men , in 1897 , and was not finally superseded until 1907 . In that year , a Browning self-loading pistol was introduced by the Swedish Army , and a Model 1887 service revolver ( next de-  | scribed ) was passed over to men issued with Model 1871 arms , in substitution for that elderly design . As early as 1885 , shortcomings in the Model 1871 design had led a Swedish Army commission to seek more suitable revolvers for officers or senior N.C.O.s and , after trials with Gasser-Kropatschek ( see Plate 7 ; lower ) , Nagant ( Belgian ) , Schmidt ( Swiss ) , native , and Warnant ( Belgian ) weapons , a field-testing of thirty Nagant and a like number of Schmidt arms , had resulted in adoption of a Model 1887 revolver shown at Plate 21 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopted also by the Norwegians ( in a version shown at Plate 17 ; top ) , as their Model 1893 service sidearm , and was a six-shot , double-action , solid-framed , rod-ejecting pistol , in 7.5-mm. centre-fire calibre , with a 4-in. ( 112-mm. ) barrel . The lock-mechanism used in Swedish M/1887 revolvers ( as with Argentinian , Belgian M/1878-86 , Brazilian , Norwegian M/1893 , Romanian M/1895 , and Serbian equivalents ) is shown at Figure 19 , Fie . 19 . Swedish ( Nagant ) double-action lock-mechanism for M/r887 evolver. where " a " is the hammer , " b " the trigger , " c " the pawl , and " d " the mainspring , which also serves as both pawl- and trigger-spring ; the cycle of operation , in single- or double-action fire , will be obvious , by reference to earlier descriptions of lock-mechanisms using a hammercatch ( for example , that relating to Figure 13 ) , but it should be noted that here the mainspring tilts the pawl by engaging a flat on the pawlaxis , that this engagement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trigger , mainspring and hammer positions " at rest " coincide to rebound the latter . Although the first Swedish M/1887 service revolvers had been purchased from E. Nagaut 's factory , at Liege ( sec L. NAGANT ) , their  | later supply was from the Husqvarna Arsenal , in Sweden , whose present Director has confirmed those quantities actually manufactured . Under a Norwegian ministerial authorization ( of 25th March , 1897 ) an order for 350 revolvers was first filled , but thereafter manufacture for the Swedish forces proceeded steadily , with production-runs in 1898 ( 5,400 ) , 1899 ( 3,252 ) , 1900 ( 690 ) , 1901 ( 353 ) , 1902 ( 377 ) , 1903 ( 3,133 ) , 1904 ( 144 ) , and 1905 ( 383 ) , during our period , to total 13,732 Swedish service revolvers of native manufacture ; all were supplied to the Army Council complete with holster , spare cylinder , cleaning-rod , and turnscrew . The Model 1887 design proved satisfactory enough to be also commercially available from Husqvarna , whose catalogue Husqvarna Skjutvapen ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 35kr. , and there is no evidence that T. F. TORNELL 's quite valid improvement to it was ever seriously developed . Indeed , it is this writer 's belief that ( pace the inventions of G. ENVALL and W. T. UNGE , q.v. ) no other revolver was commercially manufactured in Sweden , during our period . SWISS revolvers By adoption in 1900 , and modification in 1906 , two models of the Borchardt-Luger self-loading pistol ( in 7.65 mm. calibre ) were issued to officers of the Swiss armed forces , so that available supplies of service revolvers were passed over to N.C.O.s ( in transport , service corps , or artillery ) likely to have but a formal need for sidearms . The revolvers in question were all six-shot , solid-framed , rod-ejecting , double-action weapons , known to collectors as the Model 1872 ? 78 ( " system Chamelot Delvigne , with Schmidt modifications " ) , Model 1878 ( " system Warnant " ) , or Model 1882 ( " Schmidt " ) arms . The Model 1872 ? 78 had a lock-mechanism ( also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolvers ) which is shown at Figure 15 , and must have been quite scarce by 1900 , since it had originally been issued ( in 1872 ) as a 1o ? 4-mm. rim-fire revolver , but was later converted to centre-fire when the then new Model 1878 revolver was introduced for mounted officers . This weapon measured about 11 inches ( 275 mm. ) overall , had a 6-in. ( 150-mm. ) octagonal barrel , and weighed over 2 lb. ( 1,000 g. ) unloaded . The 10.4-mm. centre-fire Model 1878 Swiss service revolver offers identification problems to anyone interested in establishing the sources from which its design was drawn . The Eidg . Waffenfabrik , Berne , where it was made , has described the arm to this writer simply as having been " after the system Scholberg and Cadet with lock-system Warnant " , whilst Rudolf ' Schmidt ( writing in 8489 ) described it as a " system  | Schmidt " weapon , with his only acknowledgement to Warnant made in relation to the rod-ejector . However , Schmidt 's own drawing of this lock-mechanism indicates that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Warnant , mentioned in Appendix II entries upon O. JONES and A. T. DE MOUNCIE , it was actually of a type midway between those mechanisms shown as Plate 16 ( lower ) and Figure 4 . Thus it had the rebound lever or " mainspring auxiliary " ( shown as " n " , in Figure 4 ) of the " Schmidt-Galand " lock-mechanism , but lacked any " hammer catch " pivoted to the breast of the hammer , as in Plate 16 . The weapon measured 9 inches ( 235 mm. ) overall , had a 42-in. ( 116-mm. ) octagonal barrel rifled with four grooves , and weighed over 11 lb. ( 75o g. ) unloaded . The Swiss Model 1882 service revolver shown in Plate 20 ( top ) was also called a " Schmidt " revolver ( in honour of Rudolf Schmidt , a noted Swiss small-arms authority , and Director of the Eidg . Waffenfabrik ) , and had that " Schmidt-Galand " lock-mechanism , shown in Figures 4 , 12 and 33 , which was so extensively used by late nineteenth-century revolver-makers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after 1887 ) loading-gate safety-device described in relation to Colt and Portuguese weapons respectively embodying such features ; they measured 9 inches ( 235 mm. ) overall , had 44-in . ( I16-mm. ) octagonal barrels rifled with four grooves , and weighed over 1 lb. ( 75o g. ) unloaded . The original cartridge had a paper-patched bullet , but ( from 1887 ) this was replaced by a copper jacketed Rubin bullet . TURKISH revolvers Purchases of rim- and centre-fire Smith &; Wesson single-action , hinged-frame , self-ejecting revolvers ( and German copies of them ) had been made for the Turkish armed forces , between 1874 and 1883 . However , it seems likely that such weapons were bought for issue to cavalrymen , and not carried on the person . Until around 19o8 , indeed , a sword appears to have been the only approved sidearm for personnel and officers on foot ; thereafter , pistols ( with knives and bayonets ) were carried by Turkish soldiers and officers , but no revolver or self-loading pistol seems to have been formally issued , even by 1914.  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not one generally prosperous for the whole British gun-trade . There were , of course , exceptional cases amongst manufacturers of military rifles , machineguns , and ammunition ( G. Kynoch &; Co. , for example , grew from a single-factory concern , with twenty-three clerks , five travellers , and a year 's trading-loss of ? 19,000 , in 1888 , to be the nine-factory Kynoch Limited , employing 235 clerks , forty-five travellers , and with a trading profit of LIOO , 000 , by 1904 ) , but the overall picture was one of declining British commercial small-arms production , yet of expanding output in Belgium , France or Spain . Even those later wars and disturbances noticed with the Introduction failed , for example , to boost the total of proofs at the Birmingham Proof House back to that modest plateau ( of slightly over half a million proofs ) annually enjoyed between 1889 and 1891 . Admittedly , a fair proportion of entries in Appendix II relates to patentees of stated British domicile ( though not necessarily of nationality ) , which might be taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ native ideas , but even the most casual examination of that listing demolishes any such assumption . Thus twelve names in the total are those of Patent Agents , acting for overseas applicants more interested in blocking British manufacture of their designs than in promoting the same , and only twenty-one patentees ( marked with an asterisk in the list ) actually achieved even modest commercial production of their inventions here .

It should be noted , as significant of the situation within the British firearms industry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as known to have produced their inventions commercially , nine of those cases related to protection secured before 1889 . The purpose of this Chapter being to deal ( as in Chapters I and II ) with those revolvers used or made in a particular country , the reader 's attention is directed to Appendix II for details of any other type of invention noticed in the listing above , which was patented in the United Kingdom between 1889 and 1914 . As to revolvers ( and bearing in mind that almost all commercial arms described in Chapters 1 and II were available to British buyers ) , the  | following is an alphabetical listing and commentary upon known United Kingdom manufacturers and suppliers of the period . ADAMS revolvers The Adams 's Patent Small Arms Manufacturing Co. traded at No. 391 Strand , London , until 1894 , when it moved briefly to Nos. 40 and 42 Crampton Street , S.E. ( at Newington Butts ) , but went out of business in 1895 ; with it , passed the firm of Adams &; Co. , at No. 32 Finsbury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be found upon both solid-framed and hinged-frame self-ejecting revolvers ( similar to those shown at Plate 24 ; lower ) which , the firm 's advertisements notwithstanding , it almost certainly did not make . In 1881 , the Adams 's Patent Small Arms Manufacturing Co. had been successors to a limited liability company of similar name ( established in 1864 ) which had supplied a large solid-framed , double-action rod-ejecting revolver , patented by John Adams , to H.M. Government , as an official service side-arm of .45o centre-fire calibre ; although superseded by the " ENFIELD " revolver ( q.v. ) in 188o , this Adams weapon remained in police and gaol service over the earlier part of our period and the Adams 's Patent Small Arms Manufacturing Co. certainly advertised itself as a revolver manufacturer and supplier of " . . . revolvers of every description " for so long as it traded . ACCLES and GRENFELL revolvers See Appendix II , i.e. " J. G. ACCLES " and " H. H. GRENFELL " . ARBENZ revolvers See Appendix II , i.e. " A. ARBENZ " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ II , i.e. " A. C. ARGLES " . BOURNE revolvers Joseph Bourne &; Son ( at zoo/ioi Bath Street , and 89 ? 92 Lower Loveday Street , Birmingham ) sold a full range of Birmingham-made small-arms and accessories to the British gun-trade , during our period . The firm 's catalogues embraced revolvers , but these were poor weapons , consisting largely of Belgian types shown at Plate 9 , with the addition of a cheap hinged-frame self-ejecting arm , significantly advertised as ... plain foreign make , not guaranteed " . CARTER revolvers See Appendix II , re " ; J. CARTER " , " H. WEBLEY " , " THE  | WESLEY &; SCOTT REVOLVER &; ARMS CO. , LTD. " , and " W. J. WHITING " ; see also " WEBLEY " and " WILKINSON " revolvers below , with Plate 24 ( lower ) . DIMANCEA revolvers See Appendix II , re " H. DIMANCEA " , with Figure 39 . DYKE revolvers Frank Dyke &; Co. were merchants and " manufacturers " of smallarms and ammunition during the latter part of our period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The firm sold both American and Continental revolvers of standard patterns ( including Velo Dog arms of the type shown in Plate 6 , lower ) , but ranged no closer to British products than the description " English Finish and Proof " , applied to certain solid-framed Continental arms . ENFIELD revolvers See Appendix II , re " O. JONES " and " A. T. DE MOUNCIE " , with Plate 19 ( top ) , and Figure 34 . FLETCHER and SILVER revolvers See Appendix II , re " W. FLETCHER " and " H. A. SILVER " , with Plate 30 ( lower ) . FOSBERY revolvers See Appendix II , re " G. V. FOSBERY " , with Plate 31 and Figures 40 , 41 and 42 . GREEN revolvers See Appendix II , re " E. C. GREEN " , with Plate 32 . HENRY revolvers See " Webley " revolvers ( Mark IV ) , below . JONES revolvers See " Enfield " revolvers , above . KAUFMANN revolvers During the 11313os , P. WEBLEY &; SON ( q.v. ) had manufactured two models @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , designed by that Michael Kaufmann noticed in later Appendix I1 remarks upon O. JONES and A. T. DE MOUNCIE ;  | Kaufmann held British Patents Nos. 4302 of 21st October , 188o ( for the lock-mechanism shown at Figure 29 , in comparison with a later version improved by J. G. ACCLES and H. H. GRENFELL ) , and 3313 of 29th July , 1881 ( covering a barrel-latch used in the first " WebleyKaufmann " model ) , whilst T. W. and H. WEBLEY held British Patent No. 5143 of 24th November , 1881 , for the ejector-mechanism , and H. WEBLEY held British Patent No. 542 of 1st February , 1883 , covering an improved barrel-latch used in the second or " Improved Government " model of this design . By 1889 , however , only the ejector patent remained in force ( see Table I ) , for P. WEBLEY &; SON had turned its attention to other hinged-frame designs , later described in remarks upon " WEBLEY " revolvers . Therefore , although it may be assumed that " WebleyKaufmann " and " Improved Government " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in use during our period , manufacture seems to have ceased before 1889 , and such arms can only be dismissed here as of an obsolete pattern . KERR or LONDON ARMOURY CO. revolvers The firm of James Kerr &; Co. ( at 114 Queen Victoria Street , E.G. ) also styled itself " The London Armoury Company " until , in 1894 , a limited liability company was registered as The London Armoury Co. , Ltd. , and took over that firm 's business ; the new company traded until long after 1914 . Although described as " small arms and ammunition manufacturers and agents " , it was in the latter field that both the original firm and the successor company shone , with such important agencies as those for Colt , Merwin Hulbert , or Winchester arms amongst their activities in this field . However , inexpensive solid-framed or self-ejecting revolvers ( of those types shown in Plates 22 and 24 ; lower ) will be encountered bearing the firm or the company name , and it is clear that a perfectly conventional retail business , selling arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolvers See Appendix II , re " H. or H. A. SCHLUND " . LINES revolvers See Appendix II , re " A. LINES " , and Figure 50 . MORRIS revolvers Sec Appendix 11 , re " R. MORRIS " .  | DE MOUNCIE revolvers See " Enfield " revolvers , above . OSBORNE revolvers As mentioned in Appendix II ( see " F. CASHMORE " , " C. O. ELLIS " , and " E. W. WILKINSON " ) , the Birmingham firm of Charles Osborne &; Co. , Ltd. sold a wide variety of small arms at its Whittall Street premises but , although advertised as " Manufacturers of Guns , Rifles , Revolvers and Pistols " , it seems certain that most of the revolvers which it catalogued were actually imported , and not made in Birmingham at all . The " Osborne " weapons shown at Plate 9 were all of Belgian origin ( albeit some may have been finished at Birmingham , from Liege components ) , and the same catalogue also featured Colt , Harrington &; Richardson , Iver Johnson , and Smith &; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm had an agency for the first ? and last ? named American revolvers , and it is noticeable that no named Webley pistol of any kind appears in the " Osborne " catalogue . Since Cashmore , Ellis &; Wilkinson troubled to secure that Br . Pat . 5151/1896 described in Appendix II , it must be assumed that their " Osborne " firm then had access to revolver-manufacturing facilities in the United Kingdom , but nothing illustrated in post-1896 catalogues seen by this writer can be definitely identified as of British manufacture , with the possible exception of a revolver ( offered in ? 320 , ' 380 , ' 450 , ' 455 or ? 476 centre-fire calibres ) closely resembling the weapon shown as Plate 24 ( lower ) . Certainly , no revolver embodying the improvements of Br . Pat . 5151/1896 has been observed , either in fact or catalogue . ROSSON revolvers Charles Rosson ( at No. 4 Market Head , Derby ) catalogued shotguns , rifles , revolvers and accessories , of good quality , during the 189os amongst them being Colt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ described , and including that shown as Plate 24 ( lower ) . He also listed " Rosson 's Revolvers " ( in " Constabulary " , " Bull Dog " , and " New Revolver " lines ) , which he did not illustrate , but which were probably of the general type illustrated at Plate 9 . The source of supply for such arms is unknown but ( since he also specifically listed Webley " R.I.C. " weapons described below ) was probably Liege . SCHLUND revolvers See Appendix II , re " H. or H. A. SCHLUND " .  | TRANTER revolvers William Tranter had been an important Birmingham revolver maker , in years prior to 1885 ( when he retired ) , and it is reasonable to assume that many of his well-made arms remained in use after 1889 . The Tranter factory ( at Aston Cross ) was also briefly involved in manufacture of SCHLUND revolvers , but Tranter-designed pistols were conventional double-action hinged-frame self-ejecting or solid-framed arms . WEBLEY revolvers The firm ( and subsequent limited liability company ) described in Appendix II entries relating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ REVOLVER &; ARMS CO . LTD. , never depended upon revolver-manufacture to stay in business , although choosing to manufacture and sell a surprising range of such arms during our period , latterly even in competition with its own self-loading pistols . It was at various times contractor to the Admiralty and H.M. War Department of Great Britain ( together with the London , Metropolitan and Dublin Police , and the Royal Irish Constabulary ) , as to India , the British Colonies , the French Government , the Imperial Chinese , Imperial Japanese , and Argentine navies , and to the Cape Mounted , Lisbon and Egyptian Police , and had ( for almost the whole of our period ) a monopoly in the supply of new issue service revolvers to the British armed forces . However , in relation to British civilians or British officers ( the latter being free to buy any revolver chambering service ammunition ) , competition from American or Belgian suppliers was keen , and there being no preferential tariffs to favour British arms imported into the various countries of the British Empire , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our period fall into two main categories , namely , solid-framed , gate-loading , rod-ejecting and ( the firm having examined and rejected the swing-out cylinder , hand-ejector alternative ) hingedframe , self-ejecting arms . As to the first category , by 1914 Webley solid-framed revolvers were offered in two basic double-action lines , being the " R.I.C. " and " No. 2 Pattern " models , both of which were available in a variety of calibres , and both of ' which used a lock-mechanism similar to that shown at Figure 32 , though lacking the patented cylinder-bolt of J. CARTER ( q.v. ) shown therein . Weblry 's " R.1.C. " line comprised :  | ( 1 ) The " R.I.C. No. 1 , ' 4501 ' 455 " model , a six-shot weapon , chambering either ' 450 , ' 455 , or ' 476 centre-fire cartridges , which was normally offered as a 30-oz. revolver with the 41-in. barrel shown upon a non-standard weapon in Plate 30 ( lower ) , but could be supplied with 6-in. barrel ( and weighing 33 oz. ) for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were sometimes made up with a springloaded rod-ejector ( housed in Colt style , against the barrel ) , apparently to simulate a " New Model Army Express " pistol briefly popularized by P. WEBLEY &; SON during the early i 88os ; specimens of this weapon are as rare as the arm which they imitated , and appear to be numbered into that global serial-range reserved for all heavy-calibre " R.I.C. " revolvers although , to date , this writer has only observed such specimens in the series 77000 ? 87000 therein . As shown at Plate 30 ( lower ) the shortbarrelled model was used as a vehicle for the improvements of W. FLETCHER and H. A. SILVER ( q.v. ) . ( 2 ) The " R.I.C. 831 ' 450 " , " R.I.C. 831 ' 455 " and " M.P . ' 450 , models , respectively a five-shot , I8-oz. revolver with 3-in. barrel ; a five-shot 20-oz. revolver , also with 3-in. barrel , but having cylinder and frame lengthened to accommodate the more potent cartridge ; and a six-shot 27-oz. weapon ( with 22-in. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by various shipping companies . Like all Webley " R.I.C. " revolvers , these models were rifled with seven grooves , twisted to the right . ( 3 ) The " R.I.C. No. 2 , ' 320 " model , a 12-oz. revolver , with 2-in. barrel , which could be supplied in ' 320 or ' 32 S &W; centre-fire chamberings. ( 4 ) The " Webley No. 5 ' 360 Express " ( see Plate 22 , top ) , which could be had in barrel lengths of 3 inches ( weighing 19 oz. ) or 4z inches ( weighing 20 oz. ) , and which chambered either the No. 5 ? 360 Rook Rifle cartridge , or standard ? 38 revolver rounds . This model in the " R.I.C. " line may have been introduced well after versions described at ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) above since , although specimens appear to be numbered into the same serial-range as those other arms , this writer has not yet seen a " Webley No. 5 ' 360 Express " numbered below 6i000 . As Major Dowell has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 38o chambering only , and with long barrel or with self-cocking lock mechanism and hinged-bar trigger ; the latter variant may have been a late one , two specimens so far observed by this writer being seriallynumbered 88844 and 100330 . Finally , as can be noticed in Plate 22 ( top ) , the cylinder-fluting and ejector-rod heads on early revolvers are in shapes later discarded for those patterns shown at Plate 30 ( lower ) .  | All of the " R.I.C. " models listed above could be bought in blued or nickel-plated finishes , and gold- or silver-plated weapons ( with exotic butts ) can be encountered . The names of retailers appear upon these revolvers more commonly than that of their maker , but it was standard practice for their model-name ( and the Webley " winged bullet " trademark ) to be impressed upon the forward side of each frame . The range of Webley " No. 2 Pattern " revolvers is shown at Plate 22 ( lower ) , all had 3-in. barrels , and the weight or calibre of each model can be read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly cheaper version of the Webley " R.I.C. " line ( though fitted with a " parrot beak " or " bird's-head " butt , less bulky than that fitted to their running-mates ) , and it is possible that some of their components were imported from Liege , for finishing in Birmingham , although their lock-mechanism was identical to that used in the " R.I.C. " series . It is worth recording that the " No. 2 Pattern " line shown in Plate 22 had been preceded by a similar series of Webley revolvers , which were also sold under , and marked with the name " British Bull Dog " ; these earlier models closely resembled that revolver shown as P. 1493 on Plate 9 , and were ( unfortunately for the collector ) matched by similar American and Belgian solid-frame revolvers , also marked " British Bull Dog " and only to be readily distinguished by their use of a prawled butt . The point is raised here in warning to the reader that not every revolver catalogued as a " British Bull Dog " arm will necessarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those " R.I.C. " models described above , " No. 2 Pattern " arms were available in a choice of finishes , including presentation , will be found to carry Webley 's model-marking and trade-mark , and were sold by retailers whose names and addresses may appear upon them . Webley hinged-frame self-ejecting revolvers of our period may conveniently be listed here in the following basic varieties , namely WebleyFosbery ; service issue ; commercial " Target " and so-called " Army " ; and " Police " or " Pocket " models , the first of which is sufficiently covered in Appendix II ( see G. V. FOSBERY ) . Although P. WEBLEY &; SON had secured its first War Department contract to supply hinged-frame self-ejecting revolvers in July 1887 ( that order being for Io , 000 pistols ) , the model purchased did not formally supersede earlier " Enfield " or " Adams " pistols , still in issue , until very late in 1892 . At that time , however , such competing arms began to be withdrawn and replaced by " Mark 1 " Webley revolvers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scaling of filrther patterns , namely ,  | the " Mark II " ( in 1894 ) , " Mark III " ( in 1897 ) , " Mark IV " ( in 1899 ) and " Mark V " ( in 1913 ) , to the exclusion of any other revolver as an official issue to H.M. armed forces . The " Pistol , Webley , Mark I , B. L. Revolver " is shown at Plate 23 ( top ) , and was a six-chambered , double-action , hinged-frame , selfejecting weapon , originally issued in .442 centre-fire calibre , but subsequently made in ? 455 and ? 476 centre-fire versions also . The majority of examples encountered will be issue service arms , but this model was also sold commercially , and can be found in plated finishes , with retailers ' names engraved upon it . Ignoring " Corps numbers " , later mentioned , or numbers used by shipping companies and other industrial organizations , the basic Webley Mark I serial numbers appear to be consecutive , from Major Dowell 's observed 679 up to late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 39000 serial range . All examined specimens measured 94 inches overall , had a 4 in. barrel ( Metford-rifled , as for all Marks , with seven grooves twisted to the right ) , and weighed about 35 oz. when unloaded . Originally this weapon had a solid standing-breech , but later models ( officially designated " Mk I* " ) had a separate steel shield dove-tailed into the standing-breech , which could be replaced whenever the firingpin hole in it wore to unacceptable dimensions . As was the case with all Marks of issue Webley revolver , this first example had the famous thumb-operated " stirrup " barrel-latch , which was pivoted upon a screw passed transversely through the standing-breech , and locked down the rear end of the barrel-strap when " at rest " ; the latch was protected by Br . Pat . 4070/1881 ( of J. CARTER and H. WEBLEY , q.v. ) , but claimed as an invention of E. C. GREEN ( q.v . ) . Cylinder and cylinder axis were removable , as a complete unit embodying the ejector ( or " extractor " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolvers ) , ejector spindle , and ejector spring , by removing an external screw visible on the left of the barrel lug , at Plate 23 ( top ) ; the cylinder axis was tubular , but slotted to permit bearing of the ejector lever against the ejector spindle ( sliding inside that axis ) to expel the ejector when the barrel was depressed upon its hinge . The cylinder was , of course , rotatably mounted upon the cylinder axis , and only to be detached from that axis by turning out the ejector spindle screw inside the axis , removing the ejector ( with spindle and spring ) and then turning out an anti-friction nut , normally concealed by the ejector upon which , bearing against the rear end of the cylinder axis , the cylinder actually rotated . Whilst this may sound a complex assembly , it was protected by Br . Pat . 514.3/1881 of T. W. &; H. WEBLEY ( q.v. ) , and it is hoped that  | Figure 20 will make the above description clear , together with operation of the rotatable lever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situ ) expelled the ejector when the barrel was depressed upon its hinge . As may be seen , that lever ( " a " in Figure 20 ) had a tooth upon its lower periphery , which bore against the front of the frame as soon as the barrel began to be tilted and therefore caused " a " to revolve upon the joint axis screw ; since the curved upper arm of " a " bore against the front Cylinder-assembly and ejector detail of Mark I Webley service revolver . ( After Br . Pat . 514311881. ) end of the ejector spindle , this rotation of " a " forced that spindle upwards ( carrying with it the ejector to expel the cartridges ) and compressed a spring around the spindle . Eventually , the tilting barrel overrode the tooth on " a " and ( since " a " turned upon an oval aperture ) forced it upwards into the barrel-lug , clear of the frame , permitting the ejector spring ( working against a screw on the front end of the ejector spindle ) both to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a " forward into engagement with the frame , when the barrel was tilted back and latched . One minute spring-steel lever , embedded in a slot in the wall of " a " , sprang out that component from the frame-hinge ( with its tooth projecting to engage the frame again ) , when the barrel was latched shut . " Mark I " Webley revolvers embodied a double-action lock-mechanism of " Schmidt- ( .gland " design , the basic operation of which has already been described in relation to Figure 4 , and which was used in  | certain Austrian ( see Fig. 12 ) and Dutch service revolvers also ; the Webley version followed that form shown at Figure 33 ( inclusive of the improvement , sketched therein , protected by the Br . Pat . 16638/1888 of J. CARTER , q.v. ) , but also had a cylinder-bolt developed by this firm , through use of which the cylinder was firmly bolted , whether the pistol was cocked or the hammer was down and rebounded . This cylinder-bolt is shown at Figure 21 , where " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cylinder-bolt ( pivoted about the axis of the trigger-screw ) , " c " the cylinder-bolt spring , secured by a screw , and " d " a fixed cylinder-stop formed integrally with " A " ; the parts are shown as they would be when at rest , and it should be noted that " b " has two minute bents ( cut on the upper side of its pivot ) with one or other of which , dependent upon whether " b " is tilted up or down , the spring " c " can engage . At rest , " d " is not engaged with the cylinder , but " b " is lodged in one of the forward cylinder locking-notches visible in Plate 23 ( top ) , and held there by engagement of " c " with the lower bent upon " b " . Rearward movement of " A " ( whether by finger-pressure when selfcocking , or via the trigger-toe in single-action fire ) eventually takes " d " upwards into engagement with one of the rearward cylinder lockingnotches visible in Plate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cylinder , and thus leaves the cylinder free for rotation by the pawl ; during this trigger-movement , however , " b " strikes the edge of that frame-aperture through which it reaches the cylinder , and this engagement tilts " b " upon its pivot , and then causes " c " to flick " b " upwards into engagement with one of the forward cylinder locking-notches , this time by engagement of " c " with the upper bent on " b " . The cylinder is thus double-bolted at discharge . When the trigger is released , it is restored to the " at rest " position by the mainspring auxiliary , and this movement ( since " b " is trapped against the cylinder ) overrides " c " , and causes that component to engage once more in the lower bent of " b " . This system worked well , and was protected by Br . Pat . 5778/1888 of J. CARTER and W. J. WHITING ( q.v. ) , although shown in the Specification as applied to a solid-framed self-cocking revolver which P. WEBLEY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by comparing Plate 23 ( top ) and ( lower ) , those " Mark II " Webley service pistols approved in 1894 differed only slightly in appearance , from " Mark I " arms , notably in the absence of any prawl to the butt , and in a bulkier hammer ; internally , use of a separate shield was maintained , and two mechanical changes occurred , one to the ejector lever ( " a " in Figure 2o ) , which now had a separate auxiliary lever and coiled spring , in place of a single spring-steel  | component ) , and another by use of a coiled spring for the hammer-catch , to replace the " Mark I " V-spring . This new weapon officially chambered ' 455 or ? 476 centre-fire cartridges , and was dimensionally almost the same as a " Mark I " revolver , although an alteration to the shapes of trigger-guard and barrel latch boosted its weight by f oz. ; serial numbers ran on from those applied to " Mark I " arms , and have been noted by this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 000 approximately . Cylinder-bolt detail from Mark I Webley Service Revolver . ( After Br . Pat . 5778/1888 . ) Although fractionally longer ( at 9z inches ) and heavier ( at 37 oz. ) than " Mark II " revolvers , " Mark III " weapons had the same general external appearance as their predecessors . Trigger-guard , barrel-latch , and lock-mechanism components ( other than trigger and hammer ) were interchangeable with " Mark I " , " Mark I* " or " Mark II " equivalents ; all " Mark III " parts interchanged with later " Mark IV " components . However , the cylinder assembly of " Mark III " or " IV " weapons would not interchange with that of earlier Marks , and constituted the only major improvement introduced by " Mark III " arms . Dowell records that early issues of the " Mark III " service revolver embodied a sear and spring , which permitted the hammer to be half-cocked ; this writer has not observed a weapon modified in that fashion , but assumes the modification broadly to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ component " e " of Figure 15 . As to the " Mark III " Webley cylinder assembly , its axis was now permanently fixed to the barrel-lug , and the cylinder ( complete with ejector , ejector spring , and spindle ) could be readily removed from that axis , by use of a simple catch shown in Figure 22 ; this system was protected by Br . Pat . 17291/1896 of W. J. WHITING ( q.v. ) , as a patent of improvement to his earlier Br . Pat . 3427/1891 , and was used in all subsequent Marks of ' Webley service revolver .  | In Figure 22 , " x " is called the " cylinder cam " , and is engaged ( at the part-arcuate surface visible on its left underside ) by fingers protruding from " y " ( the so-called " cam lever " ) and from the head of the jointaxis pin beneath " y " . The cylinder cam " x " is a stirrup , having its crossmember coming between the front end of the revolver cylinder " z " , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " is carried on that barrel-lug , by embracing it with arms pivoted to a screw passing transversely through the lug , and " x " may be tilted up or down ( on that pivot ) for its cross-member to engage or disengage an annular collar or groove on the front of " z " . Such engagement must obviously keep the cylinder fast upon its axis , and is effected via the cam-lever " y " and by so dimensioning the knuckles of the barrel frame hinge that the crossmember of " x " is sustained by wiping across the circumference of those knuckles , as the barrel is tilted to-and-fro upon its hinge . Since , however , it is necessary , both that the cylinder revolves unhampered and that " x " be capable of releasing " z " for removal , the knuckles of the frame joint are relieved by transverse grooves ( " b " and " c " in Figure 22 ) , and the cam lever " y " is provided for releasing " x " . Thus the cross-member of " x @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the barrel is latched , and is thereby clear of any friction against the walls of the annular retaining collar on " z " ; when the barrel is tilted down for removal of the cylinder , however , the cross-member of " x " is aligned with the deeper relieving groove " c " , and may be depressed into that groove ( clearing the annular collar altogether ) by use of the cam lever " y " . The latter has first to be released ( by removal of a retaining screw visible in Figure 22 ) , but lifting of its tail thereafter will turn the cam lever about its pivot , and cause the finger at its upper end to strike a pendant forward arm of " x " ; this pressure raises the forward end of " x " , and ( since the component is pivoted ) lowers the cross-member at its rear from engagement with the collar on " z " . Use of a flat nut ( instead of a screw ) , to secure its joint-axis pin , distinguishes the " Mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " arms , but instructions to unit armourers that " Mark IV " components be used to repair " Mark III " pistols can ( where markings are corroded or hardened grease covers them ) make ready identification of the earlier model sometimes quite difficult . However , the " Mark III " does appear to have its own serial-range , in which Dowell notes a pistol numbered as low as Io1 , and this writer has seen one numbered above i0000 . Revolvers reported with serial-numbers in the 70000 range have so far been found , upon examination , to be Mark IV weapons . " Mark I V " Weblcy revolvers were extensively carried during the  | South African war ( but it is doubtful if they saw much combat use ) , had a lighter hammer than the " Mark III " pistol , and that screwmounted cylinder cam actually shown in Figure 22 . The service version had a 4-in. barrel , measured 94 inches overall , and weighed 36 oz. , but specimens with barrels 3 , 5 or 6 inches in length are also reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms either chambering .2971 ' 230 small-bore centre-fire cartridges ( in place of the .455 service round ) , or embodying adaptors of a type mentioned in remarks upon J. F. and H. W. LATHAM , R. MORRIS or J. T. MUSGRAVE ( q.v . ) ; Dowell also notices a special target version ( in service calibre ) , supplied for sale by an Edinburgh gun-maker , Alexander Henry , and having a brazed-in replacement barrel rifled to his specification . The serial-numbering of " Mark IV " service arms remains to be clarified , for although the bulk of observed specimens fell into a range 76000-127000 , serial numbers well outside those limits have been reported to the writer . In full-bore versions , the " Mark V " service revolver and the " Mark Cylinder-release mechanism of Mark III and Mark IV Webley service revolvers . ( After Br . Pat . 17291/1896. )  | IV " issue arm appear identical , though a cylinder dimensioned for smokeless powders boosted the unloaded weight by an ounce , and this new weapon was also sold commercially with a 6-in. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were observed in a range 130000-170000 , but higher serial-numbers ( notably upon civilian arms , with 6-in. barrels ) have been reliably reported . In concluding these necessarily brief remarks upon Webley issue service revolvers , it may be useful to record that ( by 1912 ) these were officially to be stamped , on the upper part of the butt-strap , both with the number and the month of their year of issue ( " Ordnance marks " ) and with " Corps marks " embodying consecutive numbers , i.e. " R.S. " for The Royal Scots ( Lothian Regiment ) , " R.B. " for The Rifle Brigade ( The Prince Consort 's Own ) , and so on . It was standard practice also for the factory to stamp each service pistol with Webley 's own threeline frame legend as , for example , " Webley ? Mark IV ? Patents " . By the close of our period , three hinged-frame , self-ejecting commercial Webley revolvers were available in both target and regular versions , two being in " WG " and " WS " models @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or ? 476 calibre ) which are shown in Plate 25 , and one a pistol available in ' 38 or ' 32 centre-fire calibres , later considered ( with pocket arms ) in that category to which it then properly belonged ; additionally , the revolver shown at Plate 24 ( lower ) had been produced as a commercial " Army " weapon only , for part of that period , and some pistols of the " Mark IV " service pattern ( in full-bore or sub-calibre versions ) could also be classified as arms primarily intended for target shooting . The " WG " revolvers are sometimes called " Webley-Green " arms ( although their debt to E. C. GREEN has never been formally acknowledged ) and were in production from 1885 until about 1912 , when they were dropped from Webley catalogues , presumably as superseded by that " WS " series introduced around 1904 . In " Target " get-up , both " WG " and " WS " arms commonly had 72-in. barrels , with special adjustable sights , but a shorter ( 6-in. ) barrel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Army " versions , the 6-in. barrel was normal , but 4-in. barrels have been reported , and were definitely catalogued for the " WS " line . However , in " Target " or commercial " Army " versions alike , the " WG " and " WS " lock-mechanisms differed radically in design , and other more detailed differences must be noted . Since " WG " revolvers embodied both the famous stirrup barrel-latch and the double-action lock-mechanism claimed by J. CARTER and H. WEBLEY 's Br . Pat . 40701885 , it is unlikely that this model had been marketed prior to the date of such protection , namely , 31st March ,  | 1885 , and indeed there would have been little advantage to prior introduction since ( apart from the risk of prejudicing any intended patent application ) the Webley house was then selling weapons of a very similar type , as mentioned above in remarks upon " KAUFMANN revolvers " . However , Michael Kaufmann 's patents were allowed to lapse around 1888 and , whatever the scale of production achieved up to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first real publicity at Wimbledon N.R.A . meetings in 1889 . A Webley " WG " Target ( Bisley Model ) revolver at Plate 25 ( top ) , may be regarded as a typical example of its type ; the Webley " WG " ( Army Model ) pistol had a " parrot beak " butt similar to the " Mark I " Webley service weapon shown at Plate 23 ( top ) , in place of the flared butt of the target model , but both had large removable side-plates on the left of their frame ( giving access to the lock-mechanism ) and were rifled with seven grooves , twisted to the right . The patented lock-mechanism of the " WG " revolver is shown at Figure 23 , and its cycle of operation explained in the caption to that Figure ; the cylinder assembly , ejector-mechanism and cylinder-retainer were originally of a kind described in relation to " Mark I " service arms but , as may be noted from Plate 25 ( top ) , the latter device was shortly replaced by an improved retainer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicated in notes upon the " Mark III " Webley service revolver . This new cylinder-retainer ( visible in Plate 25 ; top ) was protected by W. J. WHITING 's Br . Pat . 3427/1891 , which gives some guide to dating of its introduction , and worked in a manner generally similar to the " Mark III " device , although not locked in its closed position by any screw . It will be recalled that W. J. WHITING 's Br . Pat . 17291/1896 ( which protected the " Mark III " retainer ) was admitted to be a patent of improvement to his Br . Pat . 3427/1891 , but the pattern 1896 retainer was never applied to " WG " revolvers . A " WG " Army model revolver weighed 40 oz. unloaded ( with 6-in. barrel ) , chambered .45o , ' 455 and ? 476 centre-fire cartridges , and could be supplied with a flared wooden butt , similar in shape to that target stock shown in Plate 25 ( top ) , mounted over the " parrot beak " handle . Target Model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 71-in. barrel ) and , although they would chamber all three cartridges , were sold as regulated to shoot that round actually specified by the buyer . In either model , a " WG " revolver could be bought with blued or nickel-plated finish , and the " Army " version was also supplied in full presentation engraving , plated , and with ivory or mother-of-pearl  | grips . Cased weapons are not uncommon ( some including sub-calibre single-shot or barrel and cylinder adaptors ) , and the names of a number of well-known retailers and gun-makers will be encountered upon the barrels of either model ; Webley house-markings consisted of the words " Webley Patents " ( with the winged bullet trade-mark ) on the left frame , and " WG Army Model " or " WG Target Model " , as appropriate , on the left of the barrel-strap , although a few early pistols were marked with model-year designations for 1889 , 1892 and 1893 . Serial numbers between 1485 and 22099 have been noted by ( or reported to ) this writer upon " WG " arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existed , or whether " Target " and " Army " weapons were separately numbered . Since both patterns embodied features covered by British patents earlier noticed , this writer is inclined to the view that one serial-range served for calculating any royalties due from P. WEBLEY &; SON to the patentees , but that opinion remains to be substantiated . Webley " WS " revolvers were introduced around 1904 , commercially to market improvements tested in " Mark IV " issue arms , and were almost identical to the latter in appearance , save for their use of a flared butt instead of the " parrot beak " profile ; see Plate 25 . As a result of this parentage , the " WS " lock-mechanism has already been described in relation to Webley service arms , all " Mark IV " service components would operate in " WS " weapons , ? 450 or ? 455 cartridges would chamber in them , and the pattern 1896 cylinder assembly and retainer ( see Fig. 22 ) were present . It is probable that a " WS " ( New Army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as a 37-oz. pistol , with 6-in. barrel and service sights , but a 36-oz. weapon with 4-in. barrel was certainly available by 1914 , alongside " WS " Bisley Target arms , with 7-in. barrels , and special sights ; " WS " ( New Army Model ) revolvers could be supplied in blued or nickel-plated finishes , but the target weapon was always originally blued . " WS " serial-numbers strictly related to our period are difficult to establish , because the model continued in production for many years after those of concern here , but they also appear to march within serialranges appropriate to Webley service revolvers Marks IV and V ; one low " WS " serial number ( on a " WS " Bisley Target weapon formerly in Major Dowell 's Collection ) was noted as No. 9898o and it seems likely that a level around No. 135000 had been reached by 1914 . In turning to consider a commercial Webley hinged-frame selfejecting " Army " revolver of that type illustrated as Plate 24. ( lower ) , the reader is reminded that this pattern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , although some Liege versions ( like hinged-frame " Montenegrin " pistols , for example ) can never be mistaken for anything else , there are others which are very difficult indeed to distinguish from the Webley model , unless they are available for detailed examination . Double-action lock-mechanism for Webley " WG " revolvers . ( After Br . Pat . 4070/1885 . ) In single-action fire , a conventional trigger-nose/hammer-toe engagement is used . For self-cocking operation , however , a " hammer-lifter " ( A ) is provided , pivoted upon the same axis as the pawl ( B ) , and pushes back the hammer ( C ) by engagement of a claw at the upper end of ( A ) with the breast of ( C ) ; at discharge the claw on ( A ) levers the hammer-lifter from engagement with ( C ) , and the latter falls . The pawl-spring on ( B ) presses against ( A ) , thus keeping ( B ) forward against the rotating ratchet , and ( A ) in contact with ( C ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which has a hammer rebound surface ; ( E ) acts also as a trigger-return , being engaged with a pivoted link on the underside of the trigger ( F ) . An integral cylinder-bolting lump on top of ( F ) is complemented by a see-saw cylinder-bolt , as shown . As can be seen in Plate 24 ( lower ) , Webley sold their revolver as the " No. 4 " Model ( and permitted it to be advertised as " Webley 's Army and Navy Extractor " ) , but the pattern is probably best known to collectors , in all its various forms , as the " Pryse " weapon . The name was that of Charles Pryse the Younger , a Birmingham gun-maker , who  | secured British Patent No. 4421 ( of 15th November , 1876 ) for a cylinderbolt used in early weapons of this type , but it has now become firmly associated with the distinctive barrel-latch , to the design of which Pryse 's patent contributed nothing at all . Webley " No. 4 " Model revolvers of our period had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sold in ? 455 or ? 476 centre-fire versions ( either of which would chamber .45o cartridges ) , with 54-in. barrels ; during the early 188os a Webley " No. 42 " Model had also been sold , with a shorter barrel , but may no longer have been available by 1889 . The barrel-latch was of the well-known " tong " pattern so firmly associated with so-called " Pryse " arms , where a vertical lever was pivoted ( under spring-tension ) at each side of the standing breech . At the upper end of each lever was a bolt , sliding transversely in the lump ( on top of the standing breech ) with which the barrel-strap engaged when the barrel was latched home , and these bolts also engaged a transverse hole in that barrel-strap , when latching barrel and frame together ; pressure on the lower ends of the twin levers ( by thumb and forefinger ) withdrew the transverse bolts , and permitted the barrel to be tilted on its hinge , for cartridge-ejection or loading . The " Webley 's Patent Automatic Safety Bolt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered by the Br . Pat . 1820/1884 of J. CARTER ( q.v. ) , whose patented cylinder-bolt ( under Br . Pat . 2555/1884 ) was also embodied ; the safety-bolt consisted of a pin attached to or operated by the left-hand barrel-latch lever , which pin projected into the lockmechanism cavity ( through a hole in the frame wall ) to bolt the trigger , if the lower end of that lever was depressed . Such depression occurred automatically , of course , when unlatching the barrel , but also occurred if the transverse bolts failed to seat because the barrel was not fully latched . The cylinder assembly on a slightly more expensive version of this Webley " No. 4 " Model was similar to that used in " Mark I " Webley issue service revolvers but ( instead of securing cylinder-axis to barrel lug by a transverse screw ) the more complex turnover-button device visible in Plate 24 ( lower ) was used , which took into a notch on the underside of the axis , to hold that axis into the lug . Due to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No. 42 " revolvers may be confused with other weapons of " Pryse-type " , their serialnumbers can only be safely compiled by reference to examined specimens ; however , it is tentatively suggested that they commenced at No. 1 , and ran consecutively up to something over No. 12000 . Blued or nickelplated finishes were available , use of the Webley " winged bullet " trademark and Webley model-name frame markings was common , and the  | names of retailers appear upon the barrels of many specimens . Due to the construction of the barrel-latch , target sights were not readily attached to " Pryse-type " revolvers , and it is unlikely that a target version of the " No. 4 " Model Webley revolver was ever produced . As to that final " Police or Pocket Model " category in the classification chosen here for hinged-frame self-ejecting Webley revolvers , the reader should be warned , at the outset , that relevant model-names are confusing , since commercial weapons were here given " Mark " modelnames similar to those used on issue full-bore service arms ( see Plate 26 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the first Webley pocket-sized hinged frame self-ejecting weapon was a six-shot ? 38 calibre " Mark II " revolver , which looked rather like a miniature " WG " ( Army Model ) pistol ; this had a " parrot beak " butt , the same thumb-operated stirrup barrel-latch , and a cylinder-assembly and simple cylinder-retainer earlier described ( for " WG " arms ) in relation to the relevant Br . Pat . 3427/1891 of W. J. WHITING ( q.v . ) . These arms ( some of which had frame-mounted firing-pins and flat-bottomed butts , as in Plate 26 " D " ) are quite rare , and their serial-range appears to run only from No. 1 to just over No . I000 ; they could be purchased in blued or plated finishes , but apparently only with 4-in. barrels ( rifled with seven grooves , twisted to the right ) and only in ? 38 centre-fire calibre . Around 1896 , the " Mark II " pocket revolver design was slightly varied , and a " New ? 38o Pocket Revolver " introduced as a replacement ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the relevant weapon was briefly catalogued as the " New Improved , Mark III ? 38 " or " New ? 38 Cal . Pocket Revolver " , and ultimately became listed simply as the " Mark III " ( Pocket , Target , or Police and Military Model , as the case might be ) , when memories of the Mark II had faded . In the concluding years of our period , a ? 32 centre-fire calibre " Mark III " Pocket Model was also produced but ( the superior " WP " revolver , later described , being available too ) was not particularly popular , and seems to have been dropped from the line around 1912 . As Plate 26 " A " will show , these " Mark III " pocket revolvers differed from the common version of the " Mark II " in having a flatbottomed , slightly flared butt , and in using a domed screw ( over the cylinder-retainer ) on the joint-axis , in place of a flat nut ; the lockmechanism of " Mark II " and " Mark III " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Webley issue service revolvers ) shown in Figure 33 . The " Mark I1 I " ? 38 ( Pocket Model ) was eventually offered with 3- , 4- al Id ( i-in. h:u rels ( in versions respectively weighing 19 OZ. , 20 OZ. , and 21 01. , unloaded ) rifled with seven grooves , twisted to the right . This  | writer has only observed the ? 32 calibre " Mark III " Pocket Model as catalogued with 3-in. barrel , but it seems a safe assumption that the other barrel lengths were available , on special order . For a brief period ( probably between 1900 and 1912 ) a special " Mark III , Target Model " was catalogued by the Webley firm , with 6-in. barrel , adjustable front and rear sights , and a frame-mounted firing-pin ; this revolver could be had in ? 38 or .32 calibres , at an unloaded weight of 21 oz. , and had a special frame ( found in no other " Mark III " pistols of our period ) adapted to mount a particularly large and comfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mark III ? 38 ( Police and Military Model ) " revolver was being offered , in barrel lengths of 3 , 4 , 5 and 6 inches ( for unloaded weights of 2I , 22 , 222 and 23 oz. respectively ) , and that version with 6-in , barrel and special sights became the " Mark III " Target Model pistol ; in all versions , this weapon had a large oversized two-piece butt . However , the special frame mentioned above was not retained for use in it . The " Mark III " series embraced presentation pocket arms ( fully engraved , plated , and with mother-of-pearl grips ) , and also a few weapons sold to commercial organizations , which were appropriately marked by their owners . Serial numbers ( apart from those upon the intermediate " Target Model " , mentioned above ) appear common to .38 and ? 32 pistols , and to have started at No. 1 ; since production was merely interrupted by the Second World War , it is difficult to assess the break-off point for our period , but this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To conclude these notes upon Webley hinged-frame self-ejecting Pocket , Police , or Target revolvers , the " WP " arms must be noticed ( although their production continued for some two decades after 1914 ) , and are shown in Plate 26 . " Webley 's New Hammerless Pocket Revolver " was introduced in 1898 , as a six-shot self-cocking weapon , in ? 32 centre-fire calibre ; the shrouded lock-mechanism was merely a modified version of that basic " Schmidt-Galand " double-action design used in Webley issue service revolvers ( see Fig. 33 ) , but with a cylinder-bolt and cylinder-retainer used in no other models . The bolt appears to have been that envisaged in Michael Kaufmann 's Br . Pat . No. 189 of 1st January , 1884 ( which had expired in 1888 ) , and the retainer to have been a device ( envisaged in the Specification to W. J. WHITING 's Br . Pat . 17291/1896 ) which worked transversely to the retaining collar on the front of the cylinder , instead of vertically , as in that version adopted for Webley service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In addition , this revolver had a  | thumb-operated safety-catch ( sliding on top of the hammer-shroud ) , which bolted the hammer when pushed forward , and a removable side-plate , on the left of the frame , giving access to the lock-mechanism ( see Plate 26 " B " ) . At an uncertain date ( possibly as late as 1905 , a year when that noted retailer of Webley arms , the Army &; Navy Co-operative Society , still did not catalogue any variant ) , a ? 32 " New W.P. Hammer Revolver ( Pocket Model ) " was introduced , to sell alongside the hammerless arm . This model had a double-action version of the hammerless lockmechanism , a detachable side-plate , and the same cylinder-retainer ; however , it lacked a safety-catch , and the barrel-latch ( unlike that for the self-cocking weapon ) had no thumb-piece , but was operated by thumb-pressure against a notched surface on the cross-piece ( see Plate 26 " C " ) . " WP " revolvers could be supplied in blued or nickel-plated finishes and ( by 1914 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only with 3-in barrels and at an unloaded weight of 17 OZ. ; engraved plated arms , with mother-of-pearl grips , are known . Serial numbers do not suggest that total production was large , but it has not proved possible to estimate that serial-range relevant to our period . WILKINSON revolvers Appendix II entries relating to H. W. and J. F. LATHAM must suffice for indicating both background and patents activity of The Wilkinson Sword Company Limited , of London , and it is enough to begin here by stating that this Company does not appear to have manufactured any revolvers at all , but merely to have retailed weapons made by others . Broadly speaking , Wilkinson-retailed revolvers of our period fell into two main categories , namely , standard models ordinarily sold by any maker , and Webley weapons embodying detailed improvements specified by the Wilkinson company to its supplier . The first category is wide , for it embraced civilian versions of Webley issue service revolvers , Webley " WG " ( Target and commercial " Army " models ) , Webley-Fosbery revolvers , and other hinged-frame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that shown as Plate 24 ( lower ) , and also some Colt or Smith &; Wesson arms of solid-frame swingout-cylinder type . In our second category , it would appear , only P. WEBLEY &; SON ( or the successor limited liability company ) were involved , those weapons within it comprising slightly modified Webley " No. 4 " and " WS " revolvers only , known to modern collectors as ( i ) ) the Webley-  | Wilkinson-Pryse , ( ii ) the Wilkinson-Webley , Model 1892 , and ( iii ) the Wilkinson-Webley Models of 1905 , 1910 , and 1911 . The Webley-Wilkinson-Pryse revolver ( first identified by Major W. C. Dowell ) was a version , in ' 455/.476 centre-fire calibre , of that Webley " No. 4 " pistol shown at Plate 24 ( lower ) , with enlarged knuckles at the frame-hinge , its cylinder-assembly held to the barrel-lug ( by a screw ) in that fashion adopted for " Mark I " Webley service arms , and with a bigger butt ; the automatic safety-bolt covered by Br . Pat . 1820/1884 of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cocked revolver from being broken open , or a weapon with improperly-latched barrel from being cocked . Wilkinson 's marking upon the Dowell specimen suggest that it was introduced prior to appearance of The Wilkinson Sword Co. , Ltd. , in 1887 . The Webley-Wilkinson-Pryse design was comparatively short-lived , and superseded by a weapon shown as Plate 27 ( top ) , which was both marked and sold as the " Wilkinson Model 1892 " revolver ; this six-shot double-action hinged-frame self-ejecting pistol was in the same ' 4551 ' 476 calibre as its predecessor , used barrel , frame , cylinder , and lockmechanism components from the Webley-Wilkinson-Pryse line , but had an improved barrel-latch and cylinder-retainer . The latch was now that Webley " stirrup " design protected by J. CARTER and H. WEBLEY 's Br . Pat . 4070/1885 ( a modification necessarily eliminating the safety-bolt of J. CARTER above-mentioned ) , whilst the cylinder retainer was a variant upon that used in Webley " WG " arms , under W. J. WHITING 's Br . Pat 3427/1891 ; here a chequered spring-steel thumb-button ( visible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by pressing that button inwards , then turning it towards the muzzle , with the barrel tilted down , instead of the lower , tear-shaped , lever visible on " WG " arms . Wilkinson-Webley revolvers , Models of 1905 , 1910 and 1911 were ' 450/.455 calibre Webley " WS " arms earlier described , but with the Model 1892 Wilkinson cylinder-retainer ( in place of the Model 1896 Webley device ) , no holster-guides , and a six-groove right twisted rifling for the two later models , in place of the standard Weblcy seven-groove pattern . The Model 1905 ( see Plate 27 ) was a 37-oz . " WS " New Army Model " revolver , with 6-in. barrel , rear sight dovetailed to the top of the barrel-latch , and both Wilkinson and Webley markings ; Model 1910 and Model 1911 pistols seem to have been available in either of those " WS " target and standard versions mentioned earlier . All three models were marked " Wilkinson , Gunmakers , Pall Mall , London , S.W. " on top of the barrel-strap , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Model 1905 and other " New Army "  | weapons have " Wilkinson-Webley ' 05 " ( or as appropriate ) on the left side of the barrel-strap , where Target arms have " Wilkinson-Webley , Model 1910 " ( or " 1911 " ) engraved upon the left-hand barrel flat . As Major-Dowell has recorded , it was the practice for WilkinsonWebley revolvers to carry a Wilkinson serial-number , as well as that basic Webley serial-number appropriate to the Webley model on which the variant was based ; thus a Model 1892 is numbered 9464/783 ( the first being the Webley number and the second being Wilkinson 's ) , a Model 1905 is numbered 127026/2977 ( on the same basis ) , and so on . Unfortunately , the practice was not consistent ( so that some WilkinsonWebley arms have no Wilkinson serial-number ) , and it is not clear if the Wilkinson serial-range was common to every type of handgun , or to every type of revolver , or was actually applied in separate series to each model of revolver sold by the firm . Against this background @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or production-figures for Wilkinson-Webley arms .  | " GAS-SEAL " ARMS IN a conventional revolver ( of that type , for example , shown at Plate 9 ) there is inevitably a leakage of combustion gases , between cylinderface and barrel , when the weapon is fired ; in theory , this escape must reduce that muzzle-velocity of which the chosen cartridge is capable , although the actual effect is small in barrels of a length normal for hand-guns , and a number of designers active in our period attempted to close the offending joint . Taken in order of date , Appendix II entries relevant to this Chapter are only those for H. PIEPER ( 1886 ) , the GRUSONWERK A.G. ( 1892 ) , L. NAGANT ( 1894 ) , C. RICCI ( 1894 ) , H. M. KIPP and M. C. LISLE ( 1909 ) , G. V. HAEGHEN ( 1909 ) , and I. H. RODEHAVER ( 1912 ) ; Leleu also commended the efforts of a Belgian named Gilthay but , as with certain other Continental designers ( mentioned in Appendix II remarks upon the OESTERREICHISCHE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Gilthay 's contribution to this art remains unknown . H. PIEPER 's Br . Pat . 2167/1886 aimed at preventing any escape of gas between revolver-cylinder and barrel , on discharge , by using the cartridge-case to bridge the gap , and his Specification mentioned the attainment of that end either ( i ) by use of a sliding barrel , or ( ii ) by means of a sliding cylinder , or ( iii ) by a breech-piece moving the cartridge-case forward and backwards in its chamber ; however the basis for the first two of his routes had been anticipated decades earlier ( see , for example , W. Greener 's Br . Pat . No. 2693 , of 21st December , 1854 , and E. H. Collier 's English Patent No. 4315 , of 24th November , 1818 , respectively ) , and Pieper therefore restricted the claims of his own Specification , firstly to the idea of using the cartridge-case as an obturator or " gas-seal " of the joint between barrel and chamber and , secondly , to a specific combination of parts for effecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Figure 24.  | In Figure 24 , " a " is the barrel ( sliding in the frame ) , " b " the cylinder , " c " the hammer , " d " the lever trigger-guard ( pivoted at " e " , in Winchester-rifle style ) , " f " a sliding bar linked to " d " , and " g " a link between " a " and " d " ; the cartridges are of a length to protrude from the front figure of their chambers , so that they bridge and seal the joint between barrel and cylinder , when " a " and " b " are in contact . The seal is , of course , made positive by expansion of the cartridge-case mouth on firing . At the upper drawing in Figure 24 , Pieper 's rifle is shown after discharge , with the hammer down , the barrel resting against the face of the cylinder , and the cartridge projecting between chamber and barrel ; in the lower drawing , however , use of " d " has levered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a fired case ) , cocked " c " through the medium of " d " , thus rotating and bolting " b " conventionally , and return of that lever will , via those linkages shown , restore the gas-seal above-described.  | Pieper 's guns and rifles of this pattern are not common ( although rumoured to have been marketed successfully in Mexico ) , and were only made in fairly small calibres . However , their design certainly constituted one answer to the problem studied here , and it must remain for surmise why the patentee allowed his Br . Pat . 2167/1886 to lapse so early in its potential life ( see Table II ) , when that principle of cartridgecase obturation claimed therein was so fundamental to any effective suppression of the gas-leak in revolvers . Pieper 's next venture into this field appears to have been with a revolver of that type shown at Plate 28 ( top ) , being a design for which he never troubled to secure British patent protection , but for which he eventually held French Patent No. 208174 of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weapon ( though actually made by the OESTERREICHISCHE **26;166;TOOLONG , q.v. ) appears closely to follow the design of Pieper 's M/1890 revolver , whilst the lower pistol is an improved Austrian version of that arm . Both examples are seven-chambered revolvers , in 7.62-mm. centre-fire calibre , with double-action lock-mechanisms , and crane-mounted cylinders ( swinging out to the left ) with manually-operated collective ejectors embodied in them . The upper specimen has its cylinder-latch forward of the cylinder ( as Pieper himself envisaged it ) , where the lower has a rearmounted sliding latch , similar to that used in Colt arms of the type shown at Plate 1 . As with his design of 1886 , Pieper used a long cartridge-case to effect the gas-seal ( on its insertion into the barrel ) , but now imparted the necessary reciprocating movement by sliding cylinder on to barrel , and not barrel towards cylinder , as in Figure 24 . To achieve this junction , a mechanism shown at Figure 25 was used , where " a " is the hammer , " b " the trigger , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " d " the cylinder , which carries within it two coiled springs , the inner being an ejector spring and the outer a spring constantly urging the cylinder rearwards off the breech-end of the barrel . Both chamber-mouths and rear-end of barrel are shaped for a male/female union when pressed together , and the cylinder-retracting spring above-mentioned is assisted by the stud " e " ( mounted on the trigger , rearward of the cylinder-bolting lump " f " ) , which also thrusts rearwards against the cylinder , when " b " is fully forward . In the Austrian versions shown at Plate 28 ( top ) , it seems likely that " e " was omitted , since the notches on the circumference of both cylinders appear consonant only with the objective of bolting by the trigger in either its " at rest " or rearmost positions , and not with cylinder-retraction.  | Basically ( as a comparison of Figures 16 and 25 will show ) , Pieper 's double-action lock-mechanism was quite similar to that design shown in Plate 16 ( lower ) or Figure 16 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a " , and instead used a component " g " , mounted on the left side of " b " , to pick up the hammer in self-cocking action . Assuming self-cocking fire , from the " at rest " position shown at Figure 25 , the cycle of operations was as follows : ( i ) Pressure on " b " raised " a " ( by the medium of " g " ) against the thrust of the mainspring , and removed " e " and " f " from engagement with the cylinder , which was therefore conventionally rotated by the pawl " x " , and thrust forward on its axis by the lump " h " ( on top of the trigger ) striking the metal of the cylinder between its two lowermost chambers . ( ii ) When chamber and barrel were aligned , the cylinder had been thrust forward on its axis sufficiently for the mouth of the cartridge-case in the chamber to enter the barrel and , at that point , the hammer escaped from the trigger and fell under power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) In falling , the hammer-face struck the swinging abutment " c " , which was hinged to the top of the frame ( at a point visible in Plate 28 ) and thrust this forward to bear against and back-up the cartridge being fired . A tooth " i " on the hammer also took into a notch on " c " to bolt the abutment home , and the locking of " c " was further assisted by the inertia of a hinged component " j " ( lodged in a cavity on the left of the hammer ) , also engaging the abutment. ( iv ) Release of the trigger after discharge , permitted " b " to be restored by the lower limb of the mainspring ( lodged , as shown , in the pawl pivoted on the trigger ) , which limb also struck the hammer-heel , and rebounded the hammer . Once free of hammer-pressure , the cylinder " d " was thrust back by its internal coiled spring ( and by " e " ) , and could push back the now unsupported abutment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or nickel-plated finishes , measured 264 mm. ( io5 inches ) overall , had a i 17-mm. ( 4s-in. ) barrel rifled with four grooves twisted to the right , and weighed 800 g . ( I4 lb. ) unloaded ; they were chambered to accommodate either the Russian 7.62-mm. centre-fire service revolver cartridge ( for that " Nagant " M/1895 pistol described below ) with 7-g. bullet , or a cartridge loaded with a 5-g. bullet , or a variant cartridge containing three spherical lead balls of 7.62 mm. calibre . Both black powder or smokeless cartridges were available ( the latter giving a iuuzzlc-velocity of 370 m. /sec. to the 5-g.  | bullet , or of 275 m. /sec. to the heavier ) , and either could be loaded from chargers of a type similar to that patented by A. J. WATSON ( q.v . ) . A weapon patented by the ACTIENGESELLSCHAFT GRUSONWERK ( in 1892 ) is shown as Figure 26 , and this writer has not succeeded in tracing any specimen arm . As may be seen from Figure 26 , 9 Qii211NI " h io @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patent of H. PIEPER ( q.v. ) , applied to double-action revolvers , fitted with that lock-mechanism described in relation to Figure 15 . Here , the sliding barrel was attached to the cylinder-axis which was , in turn , attached to the hammer by a hook ; when the hammer was cocked , therefore , the barrel was pulled rearwards to mate with female cones machined at each chamber-mouth , and the cartridge-case entered the barrel as a gas-seal . After discharge , the barrel was pulled forward again , by a coiled spring , and cylinder-rotation was effected by a bell-crank bearing on a ratchet  | cut at the front of the cylinder . As might be expected ( since H. PIEPER 's Br . Pat . 2167/1886 still ran ) , the claims of the GRUSONWERK A.G. 's Br . Pat . 7787/1892 were devoted to a method for moving the barrel , and asserted no right in the principle of it . In turning now to the gas-seal revolver of L. NAGANT ( q.v. ) , that arm may be accepted as the only weapon relevant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Russian government , in single-action ( trooper 's ) and double-action ( officer 's ) versions , and a commercial model shown in Plate 28 ( lower ) sold in sufficient numbers for examples to be found in even the most modest collections today . Apart from his Br . Pat . 14010/1894 , Leon Nagant held an earlier relevant French Patent ( No. 220988 of 16th April , 1892 ) , with equivalent Belgian and other protection upon this revolver , but the design remains little more than a skilful improvement to H. PIEPER 's ideas of 1890 , as may be seen by comparing Figures 24 and 27 . To simplify the drawing , Nagant 's single-action revolver has been chosen for illustration in Figure 27 , but the double-action version differed only in using a hammer with hammer-catch hinged to its breast , and in necessary modification to the sliding wedge-block " q " for accommodating such a hammer ; single-action weapons could be converted to double-action , and vice versa , by mere substitution of those two parts . Thus , in Figure 27 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trigger , " a " the pawl , " p " the abutment , " q " the wedge-block , and " r " a coiled spring constantly urging the cylinder rearwards along its axis . The revolver in question ( like that in Plate 28 , lower ) was sevenchambered , solid-framed , gate-loaded , and with external rod-ejector for expelling cartridges individually ; it was loaded with rimmed cartridges of 7.62-mm. centre-fire calibre , which entirely encompassed the bullet and the mouths of which protruded about 1 ? 5 mm. from th e  | front of the chambers , when in situ . As the cylinder was thrust forward , a male cone on the rear end of the barrel seated in a female cone in the chamber-mouth , and the protruding cartridge-case bridged the joint between barrel and chamber to make a gas-seal . Forward movement of the cylinder ( along its axis ) was imparted by the pawl " a " , which began to rotate the cylinder conventionally as soon as the trigger " n " turned rearward on its axis , caught at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ m " ; such trigger-movement eventually raised a cylinder-bolting lump ( on top of " n " ) into engagement with locking-notches in the cylinder circumference , but only after the rising pawl " a " had rotated the cylinder via a conventional ratchet on the latter . After the cylinder had been rotated one-seventh of a revolution , and bolted , in this manner , the pawl " a " escaped from the ratchet , but now ( due to an inclined surface at the top of the frame-slot in which " a " was riding ) it tilted to press against the rear of the cylinder and so pushed the latter forward along its axis , instead of rotating it , as cocking continued . This forward movement consummated the gas-seal , compressed the coiled spring within the cylinder , and was actually completed as trigger-nose and hammer-toe engaged conventionally at full-cock . Meantime , during this cocking sequence , the trigger had been sliding the vertically-moving wedge-block " q " upwards in its own groove in the frame , by engagement of the trigger-nose with a mortise formed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; at full-cock , the wedge-block " q " was jammed between the rear wall of the standing-breech and the abutment " p " . This latter was pivoted as shown in Figure 27 , and the pressure of " q " upon it therefore swung its head forward against the base of any cartridge in front of it , and thus backed up both the round and the cylinder on discharge , to prevent any movement which might break the gas-seal . The abutment " p " was , of course , pierced to permit the hammer-nose to reach and fire each cartridge . When the trigger was released , the lower limb of the mainspring ( resting on " a " , which was pivoted to " n " ) restored the trigger to its " at rest " position , a movement which drew the wedge-block " q " down into the frame again ; being now unsupported , the abutment " p " was pushed back about its own pivot , by the cylinder retreating under pressure from the internal coiled spring , and a knuckle on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bolting-lump ) engaged the cylinder also , and pushed it rearwards to assist the coiled spring . All was now ready for the next shot . Since the bolting-lump on " n " only engaged the cylinder lockingnotches when the weapon was cocked , another bolt had to be used for indexing the cylinder when carrying or loading the weapon , and this ( a feature claimed specifically by Br . Pat . 14010/1894 ) was effected by spring-teeth on the loading-gate , which engaged notches at the rear edge of the cylinder , whether the gate was opened or closed ; these teeth could be overriden by manual- or pawl-rotation of the cylinder , but engaged adequately for the purpose stated . As in conventional post1878 Nagant revolver lock-mechanisms ( see Figs. 14 and 19 ) , a hammer rebound was embodied in Nagant gas-seal revolvers , in the form of an extension to the upper limb of the mainspring , which bore against the base of the hammer , when the latter was " at rest " , to tilt it back off the cartridges . Russian governmental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have occurred in 1895 , and both singleand double-action models are commonly described as " Model 1895 " pistols ; an alternative contemporary name for them was the " revolver de 3 lignes " , in reference to their calibre of about ? 30 inches . Initially , the arms were made in Liege and shipped to Russia but , subsequently , manufacture in the Imperial arms factory at Tula ( 125 miles to the south of Moscow ) either supplemented or replaced Belgian production . For reasons unexplained , but presumably due to use of smokeless powder in the other weapon , Leleu noted the 7-g. jacketed bullet as having a higher velocity ( 300 m. /sec. against 275 m. /sec. ) in Nagant 's revolver than in that of H. PIEPER , and the also reported it as capable of pene-  | trating 20 cm. of white pine , at 20 metres distance from the 114 ' 5-MM. ( 4-in . ) Nagant barrel . In addition to this service version , the house of Nagant also sold such gas-seal revolvers in barrel lengths of 140 mm. ( 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yielded muzzle-velocities for the 7-g. bullet of 330 m. /sec. or 425 m. /sec. , respectively , and prompted some contemporary speculation upon the value of high-velocity revolvers in general , and gas-seal arms in particular . On the first point , some writers seem to have preferred American or British sidearms , firing a heavy slow-moving bullet , with high knockdown value against any assailant , rather than weapons of Nagant or Pieper characteristics , with fast-moving bullets completely penetrating their targets , whether human or equine . As to the second matter , Leleu pointed out that the actual effect of the gas-leak was small in an ordinary revolver , elimination of the ? 25-mm. gap between cylinder and loo-mm. ( 4-in. ) barrel of a French M/1892 service sidearm ( see Plate 14 ; top ) improving the service cartridge muzzle-velocity by only 26 m. /sec. , whilst increasing that gap to 1 mm. decreased the velocity by only 30 m. /sec. ; on the other hand , a 300-mm. ( 12-in. ) barrel , with ? 25-mm. gap , added 10 m. /sec. to the velocity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point ( with regard to muzzle-velocities ) either in a revolver barrel exceeding 12o mm. ( 4s in. ) in length , or in gas-seal features for short-barrelled black-powder weapons of this type , since the small 25 m. /sec. advantage of the service Nagant M/ 1895 revolver 's muzzle-velocity over that of the ordinary M/1892 French service pistol owed as much to the former 's lighter bullet and powerful powder-charge , as to its gas-seal feature . He conceded the advantage of really long barrels for use in arms of the Nagant or Pieper gas-seal variety , but did not comment upon the practical difficulties of carrying such weapons in the field . Leleu ( writing in 1901 ) further recorded that the Russian government had by then taken assignment of Leon Nagant 's patent rights in the M/1895 gas-seal revolver , rather than a mere licence under them , but that writer did not give details of the arrangements , unfortunately . Examination of available specimens yields some authority for suggesting that such arrangements may thereafter have prevented any manufacture of these revolvers in Belgium , save as expressly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " L. Nagant Brevete Liege 1898 " are quite common , and others with datings up to 1900 are known , whilst Russian service revolvers appear to be dated only in and all cr 1901 , with no such Nagant commercial dating observed  | ( by this writer ) at all . Subsequent Romanian issue of a " Nagant , Model 1895 " revolver mentioned in Chapter III would seem contrary to this idea of Russian exclusivity but , it must be emphasized , the Romanian pistol has not been positively identified as of gas-seal pattern , and may actually have been a conventional weapon , similar to that shown at Plate 17 . As might be expected , improvements to the solid-framed Nagant arm were studied , and Leleu 's remarks can be read as authority for the view that a hinged-frame , self ejecting design was developed ; in more concrete terms , Mathews actually illustrates ( as No. 1526 ) a " Model 1910 Special " revolver , as made by the Fab . d'Armes et Automobiles Nagant Freres , with crane-mounted swing-out cylinder , and manuallyoperated collective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that pivoted , rearward-swinging , type used upon French M/1892 service revolvers , and was in that same 7.62-mm. centre-fire calibre as its predecessors . To conclude these remarks upon the Nagant gas-seal revolver , it is in order to repeat that this weapon ( see Plate 28 ; lower ) quite closely resembled conventional Nagant service revolvers ( see Plate 17 ) in appearance , and that those arms were not infrequently marked " Brevet Nagant " . Further , both H. PIEPER ( q.v. ) and L. NAGANT ( q.v. ) made conventional solid-framed revolvers expressly chambered for the 7.62-mm. gas seal cartridge , although ( being cheap weapons ) they lacked either reciprocating cylinder or any other form of gas-seal . It is , as a result , quite common for the gas-seal weapon to be confused with others , on casual inspection or report . As to the inventions of C. RICCI ( q.v. ) , the weapon sketched as Figure 28 may be accepted as representative of various gas-seal revolvers claimed in his Br . Pat . 16272/1894 , not one of which used either barrel- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in accordance with one of those paths earlier-mentioned as listed in Br . Pat . 2167/1886 , by H. PIEPER , q.v . ) , Ricci arranged that each cartridge be successively driven forward from its chamber in the cylinder , to mate in the rear-end of the barrel . After discharge , each cartridge-case was withdrawn into its chamber again , and the cylinder thus freed to rotate for the next shot . The weapon shown in Figure 28 could be operated manually or ( after reversing the change-lever " a " , on its back strap ) would function semiautomatically , under recoil from each fired cartridge ; however , manualoperation alone was specifically envisaged for two other Ricci models ( one having a thumb-operated trigger ) , and another worked only by recoil .  | In all cases , however , a hinged-frame revolver chambered , tapered , rimless cartridges with concealed bullets , which were driven forward into the end of the barrel , in turn , by a sliding plunger ; the latter carried firing-pin and extractor , to fire the round aligned with it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so freeing the cylinder for further rotation . In a version shown at Figure 28 , this plunger was first thumb-cocked via " b " , either initially for recoiloperated fire , or after each shot , in manual operation . Springs and linkages within this weapon both maintained the plunger against the recoil of discharge , and rotated the cylinder automatically as the plunger began passing forward to seat a fresh cartridge . M. C. LISLE and H. M. KIPP 's gas-seal revolver ( under Br . Pat . 15753/1909 ) was a self-cocking weapon , with shrouded hammer and swing-out cylinder ; the latter component was wedged forward , via a rise-and-fall linkage in the lock-mechanism , to mate male and female surfaces on barrel and chamber-mouth . The hammer could be full-cocked , by trigger-pressure , and held for release by a second pull at the trigger ; since the unconventional lock-mechanism had no hammer-rebound , a manually-operated " retractor " ( on the left frame ) had to be turned to withdraw the hammer slightly from its discharged position , before the cylinder could be swung out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was never commercially produced . G. V. HAEGHEN 's Br . Pat . 18495/1909 envisaged a recoil-operated revolver , in which cylinder and barrel mated in a gas-seal when " at rest " , but in which the cylinder recoiled along its axis ( in a long frameaperture ) after firing , to permit cylinder-rotation . Only a coiled spring ( with the inertia of ' comparatively heavy components ) held cylinder to  | barrel , and it is therefore doubtful if any gas-seal still existed by the time that the bullet had left the muzzle . Our last relevant design was that of I. H. RODEHAVER ( q.v. ) , whose U.S. Patent No. 1042I45 of 22nd October , 1912 , proposed a reciprocating gas-seal cylinder for use in double-barrelled revolver firearms of that general type described ( in Appendix II ) in relation to Br . Pat . 6937/1911 ; no specimen arm is known .  | PATENTS THROUGHOUT that period relevant here , a British patent was a grant from the Crown ( for a period not exceeding fourteen years ) to the true and first inventor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an invention in the United Kingdom . This grant was made after application , suitable inquiry as to whether or not the invention was actually patentable under British law , and payment of statutory fees ; preservation of the monopoly for its full potential term , however , required payment of renewal fees for the fifth and subsequent years of its duration . Parliamentary recognition of power vested in the Crown to grant such rights lay in the Statute of Monopolies ( 21 Jas. 1 , c. 3 ) , but the mechanics of grant and enforcement were actually governed ( from 1889 to 1907 ) by the Patents , Design and Trade Marks Act , 1883 , or ( after 1907 ) by the Patents and Designs Act , 1907 ; remarks which follow are couched in terms of the 1907 Act , but are broadly true of the position prior to that year . An application for British " letters patent " could be made to the Patent Office by any person who claimed to be the true and first inventor of an " invention " , namely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others than the inventor did not use . An invention could therefore relate either to something entirely new ( which was a rare event in the field here , but might perhaps be claimed to have occurred in the matter of Br . Pat . 19839/1901 , secured by C. KRNKA and G. ROTH ; q.v. ) , or some new method for carrying out a known objective ( as , for example , in the case of Br . Pat . 8045/1900 from I. WHEELDON ; q.v. ) , which was that category into which most inventions covered by this book will be seen to fall ; in either case , however , novelty was absolutely essential and if , therefore , the invention had become known in the U.K. , by prior use or publicity , then ( save as noticed later , in remarks upon " Convention Date " patents ) no protection could he granted in respect of it .  | The inventor 's application for a British patent had to be accompanied by either a provisional or a complete " Specification " ; the first was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whilst the latter also described how the invention was to operate , and both types of Specification were normally accompanied by drawings . In the former case , however , an inventor had subsequently to file a complete Specification ( within six months of filing the provisional description ) , and every complete Specification had to end with a definite claim , or series of claims , as to exactly what constituted the invention . If the Patent Office was satisfied that the complete Specification revealed an " invention " within that definition mentioned above , and that the Specification was correctly drafted , then ( within twelve months of application ) it would be " accepted " and publicly advertised . If the advertisement aroused no public opposition ( as by bringing forward someone already using the " invention " , whose rights would thus be prejudiced by grant of monopoly rights to the applicant ) within two months , the patent was then granted and sealed by the Patent Office , on payment of fees . It should be noted that " acceptance " of a complete Specification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sealing ; the effect of grant and sealing was to establish the patentee 's monopoly , against all comers , from date of original application , for a term of fourteen years thereafter , but subject to payment of the annual renewal fees mentioned above . Every complete Specification ( whether to current or patent longexpired ) was filed at the Patent Office , and available , as today , for study by the public . Since the document had , by definition , to describe operation of the subject invention , these Patent Office records formed an invaluable store of data by which prospective patentees might establish whether their ideas had been anticipated , but this was not the primary object of the requirement that each patentee filed such a description of his invention . The basis of reasoning , from earliest days , had been that the Crown gave benefit to its subjects by encouraging inventors to practise in the United Kingdom , and should therefore be permitted to strike a bargain with them . In return for a limited period of monopoly , the inventor had to reveal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kingdom might enjoy the benefits of his ingenuity , once that monopoly ended . The existence of complete Specifications , on public file at the Patent Office , ensured that right to the Crown 's other subjects . Although it should be clear from the foregoing that each patentee owned a potentially valuable property , in the rights of monopoly  | granted to him by the British Crown , it will be seen from Appendix II that not all patentees were free to develop those financial possibilities inherent in their protection . Some patentees ( see , for example , J. CARTER or W. J. WHITING ) were acting for , or with , principals who really owned the relevant invention and patent , because they had employed the patentee when he invented the device ; others ( see , for example , A. J. BOULT or H. E. NEWTON ) were professional Patent Agents to whom inventors had communicated the subjects of the patent . In the case of these " communicated " patents ( where the Agent handled all technicalities , to save his principal the trouble ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unable to deal with it in any way contrary to his client 's wishes , and he normally assigned , i.e. transferred the patent to his principal , after grant and sealing . In the majority of cases mentioned in Appendix II , however , the patentee was free to exploit the patent himself , or to license others to use it , as he saw fit . Such men as D. B. WESSON ( q.v. ) or H. WEBLEY ( q.v. ) , for example , were members of or owned unincorporated firms manufacturing arms , and simply manufactured their patented devices through the organization thus available to them . F. VON MANNLICHER ( q.v. ) or G. V. FOSBERY ( q.v. ) , on the other hand , were patentees without private ways to manufacture their inventions , and therefore licensed manufacture and sale by others , equipped to work their patents , subject to payment of a suitable consideration , be it lump-sum , or royalty on each article made . In many cases , of course , the expense of securing the patent proved a purely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing to take a licence to work the patent , and ( upon this lack of interest becoming clear ) the protection was duly abandoned , by failure to pay renewal fees ; C. RICCI ( q.v. ) or B. F. , F. L. and A. B. PERRY may be cited as obvious examples here . To conclude these brief remarks upon that protection invoked by the inventors listed in Table I or II , the matter of a " Convention Date " safeguard available to certain overseas inventors should be noticed and the patents of M. V. B. ALLEN ( q.v. ) and O. HAGEN ( q.v. ) cited as instances of its use . In 1883 , an International Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property had been signed at Paris , and this treaty was modified in 1900 ; Great Britain had acceded as early as 1884 , and by 1907 twenty-two other nations were also signatories , constituting a Union for the protection of industrial property . They agreed , amongst various matters , that any applicant for a patent in one member State should enjoy a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member States .  | In those cases cited above , therefore , M. V. B. ALLEN ( q.v. ) applied for his British patents in 1905 , but ( since the United States and Great Britain were signatories to the International Convention ) those patents carried a " Convention Date " priority as if granted from the date in November or December of I904 when equivalent U.S. patents had been secured by Allen ; for O. HAGEN ( q.v. ) , his Br . Pat . 409/I9I2 had priority in the U.K. from 7th January , 1911 , as it had in any other member State where the patentee also secured protection in terms of his original Norwegian patent of that date .
