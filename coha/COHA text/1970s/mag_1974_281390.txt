The carefully written note contained a message that was frighteningly clear . Unless city officials paid the letter writer $1 million and assured him safe passage out of the country , he would set off an H-bomb in the middle of town . To make matters worse , the note was accompanied by a credible-looking diagram of a thermonuclear weapon . Consulted by city officials , experts at the Atomic Energy Commission refused to say for certain that the would-be bomber was not fully capable of carrying out his threat . <P> This melodramatic incident was not conjured up by a TV scriptwriter or a science-fiction novelist . It actually occurred in Orlando , Fla. , a few years ago . Only competent police work and a slip-up by the " bomber " revealed that he was in fact a 14-year-old high school honors student in science who was bent on nothing more than a spectacular hoax . What made the mischief so chilling was that nuclear blackmail by terrorist or criminal organizations is far from inconceivable . It is quite possible that a simple but devastating atomic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without advanced scientific and technical skills . <P> That is the conclusion of a growing number of nuclear experts . A report prepared for the Atomic Energy Commission and released last week by the Senate Subcommittee on Executive Reorganization labels the nation 's safeguards against nuclear theft and blackmail as " entirely inadequate to meet the threat . " A study conducted for the Ford Foundation by Atomic Physicist Theodore B. Taylor and Arms Control Expert Mason Willrich makes the point even more strongly . In " Nuclear Theft : Risks and Safeguards , " Taylor and Willrich report that amateur bombmakers could probably put together weapons as small as one-tenth of a kiloton ( equivalent to the explosive force of 100 tons of TNT ) . Such bombs , says Taylor , would be powerful enough to topple the twin towers of Manhattan 's 110-story World Trade Center or destroy the U.S. Capitol building . <P> Greatest Deterrent . Physicist Taylor 's warning has not been lightly taken ; his credentials are impressive . During his seven years at the AEC 's Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory , he specialized in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admits that the fabrication of such devices is beyond the capability of basement bombsmiths , he feels that the manufacture of less sophisticated and powerful weapons is not .
