DAYS OF HEAVEN Directed and Written by Terrence Malick <P> Days of Heaven is lush with brilliant images . Set in the Texas Panhandle just before World War I , this movie unleashes one spectacular panorama after another : snowy plains aglow in the blue light of a winter moon , wheatfields shimmering under a burnt autumn sun , expansive skies carpeted with cumulus clouds . There is enough beauty here for a dozen movies ; yet the total effect is far from pretty . Slowly but surely the sharp images carve away at the audience 's guts . <P> Like Badlands , Director Terrence Malick 's remarkable first film , his new work is a bleak and unstinting attack on America 's materialistic culture . But Malick is an artist , not a polemicist ; his scabrous ideas are expressed in the elegiac terms of a fable . In Days of Heaven he tells of a migrant worker , Bill ( Richard Gere ) , who travels from Chicago with his lover Abby ( Brooke Adams ) and his kid sister Linda ( Linda Manz ) to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shepard ) . Tired of " nosing around like a pig " and infuriated by his employer 's wealth , Bill decides to use the ravishing Abby to bilk the farmer out of his fortune . No sooner does the scheme get going , however , than Abby falls in love with her prey . <P> Out of this slender tale , which pointedly recalls Theodore Dreiser 's novels of the period , Malick constructs a complex web of moral ambiguities . He invites us to sympathize with the criminal Bill and Abby , who have a right to revolt against poverty . But he also arouses our affection for the privileged farmer , a kind and sickly man whose riches pay off only in loneliness and boredom . To Malick , all these people are victims of their innocent faith in a warped American dream . Their tragedy is that they blame themselves , rather than their false ideals , for the misery of their lives . Though none of the characters can find either happiness or justice , God ultimately passes his own judgment on their plight . Days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of locusts-a nighttime Apocalypse so damning that it makes the similar finale of Nathanael West 's The Day of the Locust seem tame by comparison . <P> To help carry out his spellbinding vision , Malick has turned to some of the most talented figures in European film making : Cinematographer Nestor Almendros ( Claire 's Knee ) and Composer Ennio Morricone ( 1900 ) . Their work is stunning ; yet there is no mistaking Days of Heaven for anything other than an American movie . Malick 's ability to capture the terror in plain , homespun settings recalls the spooky vistas of Painter Edward Hopper . The film 's naive narration-recited in deadpan colloquialisms by the teen-age Linda-is right out of Ring Lardner 's sardonic stories . In the tradition of these other native ironists , Malick keeps his distance from his material . Though built around a heartbreaking love triangle , Days of Heaven has no introspective dialogue and no Freudian fireworks . Accordingly , actors have been cast more on the basis of how they look than how they emote . Except for Gere , who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serves the movie well . In a more conventional film , perhaps , Gere might have caused severe damage ; here he is just an irritant .
