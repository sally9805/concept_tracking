n Boston , it is the best of times . Every day thousands of visitors and lunching businessmen flock to the restaurants and boutiques of the revitalized Faneuil Hall-Quincy Market commercial center on the city 's waterfront . An accelerating pace of condominium conversions signals the renewed interest of the well-to-do in residing in Boston . Its promoters proclaim it the nation 's most livable city . There is serious talk of tento fifteen new hotels in the city and $10 billion , of new construction in the - 14 1- , , 1980s . The recently dedicated Kennedy Library is a cultural star attraction . But it also is the worst of times . Five years after the implementation of school desegregation , black students bused to South Boston High are subjected to a fusillade of rocks ' and football-sized boulders thrown by masked Whites . A black football player is shot and probably paralyzed permanently during a scrimmage in the city 's Charlestown neighborhood , an area of intense antibusing sentiment . That precipitates two weeks of sporadic racial violence , including an attack by a band @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Common . There is serious debate over whether Boston is possibly America 's most racist city . To an outsider it may all seem a paradox . A city so vibrant and yet so troubled . An urban success story ; an urban tragedy . But for those viewing the situation up close it seems all of a piece . The winners in Boston are the investors , the tourists attracted to its growing vanity economy , the professionals who commute daily , abandoning the city at nightfall . The many who reside in Boston 's working-class neighborhoods , both black and white , however , find their fortunes are not rising with the tide . Unemployment in white South Boston exceeds 12 percent , more than twice the official citywide figure ; in black Roxbury it 's above 20 percent ; for the youths of both those communities an unemployment rate of 40 percent is now chronic . Burdened with - the- highest pi **34;2546;TOOLONG ... y airili-flux of middle- and upper-middle-income families back into Boston , pressed by skyrocketing rents ( and a 3 percent vacancy rate in apartments ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " revitalized " Boston has a place . for them . Rightly insecure about their futures , they turn on those below them on the economic ladder who , they fear , are trying to take their place . Whites turn on blacks ; blacks strike back at whites . Presiding over all of this is Bpston 's 50-year-old Mayor , Kevin White . First elected in 1967 as a " liberal " mayor of the John Lindsay school ( the alternative to Louise Day Hicks ) , he was re-elected to an unprecedented fourth consecutive term November 6 . With the nearly unanimous backing of all establishment figures and institutions , with a Daley-style machine tended by 1,500 city workers , he garnered nearly 55 percent of the vote against State Senator Joseph Timilty . No man is solely responsible for the city 's racial unrest . But Kevin White deserves a good share of the blame . In the last two years he worked assiduously to cultivate South Boston , the worst of South Boston . Whatever his intentions , his actions . seemed to give sanction to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks before the election , White retained on the city payroll James M. Kelly , the head of the South Boston Information Center , an organization dedicated to keeping the antibusing banner flying , to foreVeOriagnifying the city 's racial discord . Only when it emerged-that Kelly planned to hold an avowed whites-only meeting right in Kevin White 's City Hall did his ? municipal paychecks stop . White defended his retention of Kelly by asserting thatlie Was seeking to reach out to all segments of the community . When on Election Day he scored victories in both South Boston and Roxbury , he proclaimed that " we will in this city no longer be divided as a people . " He would have had a hard time convincing the group of black teen-agers who , just two days earlier , had had to lie on the floor of the bus they were taking home from a movie as it was stoned passing through South Boston . " We were riding home Niggers , kill the niggers , ' then thunk , thunk , and glass breaking and them coming right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something . " White had not unified the city ; he had brokered it . Few in Boston thought otherwise . Politically his strategy has been an unquestioned success ; socially it has been a disaster . One has to admire the skills of a man who can carry South Boston and Roxbury in the midst of racial discord , who can employ a James Kelly and win an endorsement from an Edward W. Brooke . And the fact is that with more time to perfect his machine , to polish his patronage operation , to cement his relations with permit-seeking , campaign-contributing developers , Kevin White can become an unbeatable mayoral institution . But such a result will not unify Boston . It is the most ethnic , the most turf-conscious of cities . White areas like South Boston and East Boston and Charlestown are geographically isolated . They are populated by the Irish who for years were told they need not apply , who wrested control from the Yankee establishment and who , with their future so clouded , are not about to relinquish it to blacks or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mayoral candidate in the preliminary election this year himself and the outgoing president of the city 's school committee , wrote recently in The Boston Globe , " White politicians in Boston are not willing to talk about racial problems in a way which will either offend or alienate white voters . In short , white politicians do n't want to talk about the truth . " Even after the election , when it seemed there might be no voters to offend , Mayor White persisted in talking of the city 's racial problems as a problem of law enforcement . To deal with it otherwise , of course , would have meant not only offending some voters but possibly disturbing the suburban-dominated establishment that likes the Mayor 's downtown style . It might mean discussing whether rent controls ought to be reimposed in the city , whether condominium conversions ought to be halted , whether tax breaks granted to new construction ought to be targeted away from downtown and toward the neighborhoods , whether jobs in new city-assisted projects ought to be set aside for city residents ; whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to alleviate the economic pressures that find quick release in racial strife . During the violence this fall , religious leaders , who had kept silent during past racial troubles in Boston , organized a petition against violence and bigotry . A few neighborhood summits were called . The business community took out newspaper advertisements to urge harmony . But no one whispered a word about how Boston suburbanites who benefit from the city 's successes might contribute something toward rectifying its failings . Never did major employers suggest any hiring programs aimed at Boston residents . Never did the city 's colleges talk about opening their doors wider to lower-income city students . Without such steps , Boston 's racial divisions will not soon be bridged . If low-and moderate-income Bostonians are uncertain about how they fit into the city 's future , they will resist attempts by other groups to claim their share . If you have some money to spend , Boston is a good place to live ; it is a habitable city and getting more attractive every day . In some gentrified neighborhoods , housing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now attracts offers of $50,000 . But public housing is in such incredible shambles that a Superior Court judge recently put it into receivership . There 's a new condominium garage on Beacon Hill  --  pay $8,500 and $66 a month and a nifty parking space is yours ; but public transit deteriorates daily and there is talk of doubling the fares . Downtown boutiques proliferate and flourish , but only a handful of neighborhood shopping centers could be described as prosperous . New hotels , new luxury housing and new restaurants abound on the waterfront , but the plans for a job-producing container-port facility flounder . Kevin White calls the Quincy Market a symbol of Boston for the 1980s . But black State Senator Mel King , like Finnegan a loser in the preliminary election for Mayor , notes , " I go down there and I do n't see anybody who looks like me . " James Kelly could probably make much the same point . The energy crisis and changing life styles do herald a brighter day for cities in the 1980s . By some measures that day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mayor White declared on election night , " We 're going to make it the first city among all in the world . " Maybe so . But it will depend upon who is compiling the rankings . ?
