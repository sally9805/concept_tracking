txt Defense Secretary Harold Brown said today that Saudi Arabia had agreed to " prohibitions and restrictions " on the use of F-15 fighter planes it wants to buy . Mr. Brown gave this assurance in a letter to the Senate Foreign Relations 1 Committee as Administration efforts to reach a compromise on its proposal to sell planes in a package to Israel , Egypt and Saudi Arabia met strong resistance ' in Congress . The committee , which is set ' I to hold a pivotal vote tomorrow on the Administration 's plan , is reported " deeply divided " on the issue . President Carter phoned members of Congress and Administration officials lobbied intensely in an effort to avoid a major floor fight on the package . Church Opposes Plane Sales While Secretary Brown sought a compromise on the sale of planes , a highranking State Department specialist on the Middle East urged Israel to accept the United States peace proposals as " perhaps the only possibility " for breaking the diplomatic deadlock . Page A15.1 In Egypt , President Anwar el-Sadat suggested in an interview @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Gaza Strip to Egypt as interim steps toward peace . Page A16 . As the diplomatic ' developments unfolded , the Senate Foreign Relations Committee met behind closed doors , and a senior Democrat , Frank Church of Idaho , said that he had decided to ' oppose all the proposed plane sales . But Senator Muriel Humphrey , Democrat of Minnesota , read a statement in support of the Administration . Outlook on Vote Uncertain Their decisions left the outcome of the vote tomorrow very much in doubt . It apparently depended on the votes of Senators Charles H. Percy , Republican of Illinois , and Howard H. Baker Jr. , Republican of Tennessee . Without them , the committee appeared evenly divided . Several key members of Congress said that the Administration 's compromise proposal to sell Israel 20 more F-15 fighter planes  --  to be delivered after completion of the current package  --  was inadequate because Israel would probably get the planes anyway . " It 's unacceptable , " said Representative Benjamin S. Rosenthal , Democrat-Liberal of Queens , a member of the House International Relations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's tokenism . It 's like giving ice in the winter . " In his unusual seven-page letter to the Foreign Relations Committee , Mr. Brown sought to assure its members that the // 60 ** that the Administration seeks for Saudi Arabia will not be used against Israel . Mr. Brown said that the F-15 , which is the most advanced fighter in the Air Force inventory , will be used by the Saudis " to defend their national territory . " " It would be folly , " Mr. Brown said , " to use the F-15 offensively against neighboring countries . This is particularly so vis-a-vis Israel . " Not only would the F-15 be relatively ineffective in an offensive mode and the risk of loss of the aircraft high , " he said , " but its use away from Saudi Arabia would leave vital oil facilities , urban centers and military installations without necessary air defense cover . " Mr. Brown made the following points about the proposed sale of ** to Saudi Arabia : 9The Saudi Government has given assurances that it will not transfer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nationals of any such country to train on the aircraft without the authorization of the United States . 9The Saudi ** will not be equipped with special auxiliary fuel tanks , called " fast packs , " which would give them additional range . CSaudi Arabia has not requested that the plane be outfitted with multiple ejection racks , which would allow the plane to carry a substantial bomb load . The United States will not furnish such racks and the Saudis have indicated that they have no intention of procuring , them elsewhere . 9The Saudi Government has given assurances that it does not intend to acquire any combat aircraft from other countries while it is preparing for and receiving the 60 F-15 's . These points and others were sharply contested by opponents of the sale of the ** to Saudi Arabia , which the Administration proposes should receive the planes by 1983 . Senator Paul S. Sarbanes , Democrat of Maryland , has suggested , for example , that the F-15 could be used to fly cover for Syrian or other Arab aircraft attacking Israel . Opponents also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diversionary attack in a new Middle East war and require Israel to send ** to intercept them . Senate and House foes of the arms package also assert that Mr. Brown 's insistence that the ** will not be based at the Tabuk air base , near " the Israeli border , ' avoids the possibility that the base might be used temporarily or for refueling . It was also pointed out by opponents of the sale that the aircraft is capable of carrying laser-guided bombs , which weight about a ton each , and that such bombs are available in Western Europe . No mention was made in the letter of these weapons . Meanwhile , Jody Powell , the White ' House press secretary , affirmed late today that the Administration was offering to sell at least 20 additional F-15 's to Israel and would give a " sympathetic " hearing to any request by it for more aircraft in the future . Mr. Powell , who also cited written assurances that the Saudi ** would be used for defensive purposes , said : " We are hopeful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Senate , that this proposed solution will indeed avoid prolongation of a debate which has unfortunately become increasingly bitter in some instances . " Besides the 60 ** promised for Saudi Arabia , the $4.8 billion package now includes 50 ** for Egypt and 15 F-15 's and 75 ** for Israel . Supporters of Israel such as Senator Jacob K. Javits , Republican of New York , have urged additional sales of ** to Israel as well as a reduction to about 40 in the number of ** sold to the Saudis . The F-16 is a new but simpler plane than the F-15 designed for air-to-air dogfights . The F-5 is a cheaper and less capable fighter used mostly by air forces in the third world .
