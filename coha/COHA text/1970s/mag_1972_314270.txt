When Zambia gained independence from Britain eight years ago , it was said that the country had two specific advantages over its neighbors : its copper mines , the richest in all Africa , and its idealistic young leader , Kenneth Kaunda . Zambia still has those assets , but both have been looking a bit tarnished lately . The price of copper has dropped from $1,400 to $1,070 per ton in the past three years , costing the country some $200 million a year in revenues . And Kaunda , now 48 , under increasing political pressure at home , has decided to take the drastic step of abolishing all of the country 's opposition parties and converting Zambia into a one-party state by the end of the year . The one surviving party would , of course , be Kaunda 's own United National Independence Party ( U.N.I.P. ) . <P> A presidential commission has already drawn up plans for a new constitution for what Kaunda calls the " Second Republic . " There is no doubt that the proposals will pass ; Kaunda 's supporters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , well over the amount needed to bring the new system into effect . <P> In recent months , Kaunda has dealt with his opponents with increasing severity . Two weeks ago , his government arrested and jailed the organizers of a small dissident group that had been formed less than a month before to fight the introduction of a one-party system . More than 100 other opposition leaders , including Kaunda 's former Vice President ( and boyhood friend ) , Simon Kapwepwe , were detained without trial this year . Many were subsequently released , but not Kapwepwe . So far , the government has not interfered directly with the largest opposition group , the African National Congress , which holds 21 seats in the National Assembly . But the A.N.C . ' s veteran leader , Harry Nkumbula , 58 , knows full well that his party is doomed . He recently lost a lawsuit in which he charged that the President 's Second Republic plan would infringe on Nkumbula 's civil rights under the present constitution ; he is appealing the court 's decision , but without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own followers are disturbed that the President , who is one of Black Africa 's most respected leaders , has abandoned his longstanding belief that opposition parties can be eliminated only by the voters . Kaunda , a missionary 's son , has changed somewhat from the serene , mild-mannered man in the khaki bush jacket whose patience and persuasiveness overrode much of the anger and bitterness engendered by the long fight for independence from Britain . He has a shorter temper nowadays , and is sometimes given to emotional outbursts . He is known to have been disturbed by a split within his party caused by the defection of Kapwepwe and a number of his followers . Last May a mysterious parcel-bomb exploded in Kaunda 's office but the Zambian leader was away at the time . Kaunda 's nervousness can also be attributed to his country 's economic problems . Despite the drop in copper revenues , Kaunda is under pressure from his countrymen to maintain the momentum of development of roads , schools and hospitals as well as housing .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
