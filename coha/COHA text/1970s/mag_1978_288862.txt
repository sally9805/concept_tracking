Germany 's Flick tries resolutely to lower his marks <P> When Friedrich Karl Flick wants to vent frustrations or have a little fun , he takes over as the drummer of the oom-pah-pah band at his favorite beer cellar , Munich 's Franziskaner . After a few brews , he and his buddies-a motley of virile game wardens and ski instructors - get their jollies by smashing glasses against the walls and hurling tablecloths , laden with plates and cutlery , across the room . Last year Flick and friends completely wrecked Ingo 's Discotheque in a boys-will-be-boys night of carousing , which ended with a brunch of beer and white sausages . Do proprietors complain ? Never . Flick , 51 , is invariably accompanied by a paymaster , who covers all damages , and by a dozen stony bodyguards , who are relieved every six hours by a different dozen . <P> These days Flick , a shy-looking industrialist with horn-rimmed spectacles , has a problem , and it may cause a lot more smashed crockery in those Munich beer cellars . He pocketed $1 billion when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stock of Daimler-Benz , which makes Mercedes cars . Under West Germany 's tax code , Flick has to spend all of that sum by Dec. 31 in ways that will " benefit the national economy " - or else pay 50% in capital gains and income taxes . <P> Investing a billion is a tiresome chore , even for a high-living heir who has spent fortunes on blondes ( he has married and divorced two of them ) , villas , Alpine ski resorts and hunting retreats . He also owns a 124-ft. yacht and a Grumman Gulfstream jet , which whisk him to his favorite playgrounds at the Lyford Cay Club in the Bahamas , the ski slopes at Snowbird , Utah , and the big-game preserves of Kenya and Alaska . <P> Flick inherited his fortune from his blood-and-iron father , Friedrich . <P> Papa was a self-made Ruhr upstart who earned a bundle speculating in scrap after World War I , created a vast industrial empire , and earned a seven-year war-crimes sentence for making P.O.W.s do forced labor for Hitler . Flick Senior bounced back after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1950 , he was ordered by the Allies to sell his rich holdings in either coal or steel . He chose coal and collected more than $50 million , which he used to build an even more prosperous empire based on petrochemicals , paper , steel-and Daimler-Benz stock . Today the Flick Group is a $4-billion-a-year conglomerate of some 100 companies that make products as diverse as bathtubs and Leopard tanks for the Bundeswehr . After Papa died at 89 in 1972 , his son got it all . <P> <P> Friedrich Karl Flick sold most of his 40% holdings in Daimler because he figured that the oil crisis darkened the future for cars . Until the present moment , he has been able to reinvest only $300 million , leaving $700 million to go . He bought 12% of the shares of the U.S. 's W.R. Grace Co. ( petrochemicals , real estate , restaurants ) for $130 million , last month acquired control of West Germany 's second largest insurance company for $100 million , and added $70 million to the capital of his conglomerate .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
