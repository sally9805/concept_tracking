Alain Robbe-Grillet ITIATIONS : A CYCLE Translated by Richard Howard Pretending F YOU ARE THE ONLY GIRL , you must pretend there are two . If there are two , pretend there are three . More than three , it is too hard , even with several windows and several mirrors of various shapes . If there are over three , better pretend to be alone . Suspect identity R ELSE RESORT TO SIBTERFUGES , like wigs , or makeup for lips and eyes , or even put on a clothe hat with lace and flowers , the kind known as a fun hat , making dreamy and exalted faces I it is hard to keep from laughing ) , imitating the faraway expression of someone who has just received a letter from a great distance , the Indies or the Andes or the Undies , from a nonexistent country , a blue letter telling incredible things : the story of the three little maids who lived at the bottom of a well , the story of the seven young girls married by Gilles de Retz , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Vanadium , the story about the 121 underage prostitutes of the Blue Villa in Shanghai , or about the 999 concubines of King Solomon , son of David ; or it might even be the story of the 11,000 virgins of Cologne , in any case the story of an unspecified number of girls who do not exist , good as gold and pretty as pictures , whose pictures multiply from page to page in a book you pretend to be seeing for the first time . Rules of the game H ERE IS THE LIST OF REGULATIONS : Both of you look at yourselves in a mirror , keeping your eyes as blank as possible , as if you were staring at something still farther away , something indefinite and hazy that is happening slowly without changing place . Dress each other up , draping yourselves in veils that are too short or else ripped to shreds . Wrap a piece of unlikely fabric around your hips . Make a gown out of the curtains . Put perfume on each other , applying it at all the most delicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Do n't make any mistakes . ) Read together an insane poem . Without taking your eyes off the mirror , repeat obscenities with a very romantic expression on your face . Then , each in turn , pretend to sleep white the other , having opened the book of poems to the same page , rereads the text aloud , switching the words around . The two bodies must be touching at some point throughout the whole reading , as if entirely by chance : a toe in an armpit , or the crook of an elbow around a nipple . Transform the corrupted text all over again by replacing the poetic words with vulgar terms for the secret parts of the female body so that the thing has no meaning at all . You can begin with nouns having the same number of feet as the original , then continue with words much too long or too short . Then go over to the window , raise the curtain and look outside , saying to invisible witnesses : " She 's such a fool : she does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Now return to the bed and whisper , distinctly , into her ear : " You 're nothing but a little whore , a puddle of dirty water , a stagnant swamp , a gaping cherrystone . " And then step back , giving her a sweet smile she does n't even sec , for she really has fallen asleep . Odors T HE ODOR OF A WET CLAM , as has been said , the odor of new-mown hay , the odor of wilted flowers , the odor of leather boots , the odor of shellfish , the odor of hair , the odor of horses . You hide yourself in a barn full of hay where it is much too hot , and you dance barefoot like madwomen , until you 're dripping with sweat . Suddenly you stop and you look out the smallest window , as if you had caught sight of something amazing out in the field . And you say slowly , without turning your head : " The bay filly is spreading her legs to take a piss . " Then you stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " You 're overheated , you wild colt , you 've got yourself all wet . " Gust of wind before the rain 0 N A SUDDEN WHIM , YOU MUST NOW pretend to he annoyed , so that the other one is obliged to ask your forgiveness . The fact that she has  --  apparently  --  done no harm is not taken into account , quite the contrary . ) Meanwhile , you turn your hack to her and comb your hair , indifferently . The little devil is used to changes in the weather , she shuts her eyes until the storm passes . But you tell her she must kneel , and you bend her neck so that she hides her shame , along with her face , in the hollow of her thighs . You tell her : " You 're heavy , you 're soft , you stick to me like a strand of seaweed . " And you take advantage of the situation to caress her soft captive shoulders , which just happen to be quite naked . Finally , since she 's so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story . More than once upon a time L most of the time , you might say ) there was a brand new little nightgown with pleats and lace inserts , which was swept away by a gust of wind on a stormy night . The gust of wind swept it right out the window into a thorny hedge it could n't get out of because it was caught on the prickly branches at the neck and the arms . After an hour , it was all torn , because the wind had turned it in every direction . Then a thunderbolt fell on the hedge to release it , and the bushes burst into flame , crackling like a yule log on the hearth . immediately afterward , it began raining in floods . When the nightgown returned to the house the next morning , it was barely worth tearing up to be used for rags . Nature muffled Y OUHAVE FALLEN SILENT . You have nothing left to say to each other . Your head is empty . Your ears are filled with the invisible hum of insects chirpins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country , before the last war , or toward the end of the last century , in a place without relatives and without boys , as usual . You have wicker picnic baskets and umbrellas instead of parasols . You are reading old-fashioned novels set deep in the heart of a phantom Africa , filled with incomprehensible psychological dramas in the damp heat and the chirping of the crickets . The coffeepot has remained on the table , under the big tree , with the breakfast cups that have not yet been cleared away . The voyeur 's bicycle has been stolen . It 's an old bike left in the sheepfold ( you 've always seen it there ) , and it 's always been called the voyeur 's bicycle , ever since some horrible story someone told about it . It 's easier to use than our girls ' bikes , because of the horizontal barthat keeps the skirt up in front and leaves the thighs free . The basket in the back and the handlebar have been loaded with field flowers . You are bored . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time . There is no more time . You have n't spoken to each other for days and days . I think you have lost your tongue . And suddenly you might have heard a strange noise : like someone around a bend of the path sharpening a big knife . You would look at one another , without speaking . And with the same impulse you would abandon the path , the bicycles , the baskets , and the parasols to take to your heels across the fields , through the underbrush . You would be very frightened . Then , as usual , comes a dizzying staircase and a long corridor , with blood running out under the door of a locked room . It 's the same Horrible story beginning all over again , in a dream , in the shade of a big motionless tree . Dozing demon S HE HAS CRIED OUT IN HER SLEEP . It sounds like a scream of terror that has not managed to escape her throat , where it turns into a kind of repeated rattle , a long rasping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , according to a swelling , movement of the burning depths . To take her hand is not enough to free her from the panic of the flooded abyss that drags her down . The seventh wave , a more violent one , wrings a moan of suffering from her . You must treat her more roughly , grab her shoulders , make her stand up , slap her , shake her like a rag doll . The scattered fragments of the nightmare break loose from her and fall at her feet , like incomprehensible rags . Half-awake at last , she sees herself stark naked in the rectangular mirror above the couch where she had collapsed and scarcely recognizes herself . She is still dreaming , lying on her back in the grass , exposed , yielded up , legs parted and her hands behind her neck , among the cushions of the huge motionless mirror , doubtless a magic one , a captive of its ghosts sleeping in her own arms . In order to release her from the hallucinatory caresses that still linger here and there over her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the path , the dewdrops , the remains of the bushes or the wilted flowers that have caught on the hair of her secret places , you must now wash her body with the water from the spring , gathered in the sunshine , for you can not rely on the water from the well . which is too deep . She whimpers a little under the long trickles of water that cover her body in every direction . Is she once again quite clean , innocent , purified for the sac-rifice ? You examine with meticulous care the most inaccessible nooks for the suspect traces that the demon might have left there . She lets you have your way . She has nothing more to say . She is not really there . Soon she will fall asleep again .

Now she 's even flying away , fluttering into the air quite easily with her heavy , sumptuous wings that make an infernal din .

Scarcely more than children , we were both bought by the sultan  --  because our parents were too poor to pay for our sustenance ? and raised in an antiquated palace filled with velvets and silks , furs , marbles , and doors sealed shut by enormous locks and chains .
