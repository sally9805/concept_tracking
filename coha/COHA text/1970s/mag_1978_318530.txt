Mary Lynch of Eagan , Minn. , used to have a pet white rabbit . Her neighbor , Tim Wilson , used to have a pet black cat . One day Cootus the cat crept out , confronted the rabbit , and , according to Lynch , the bunny died of fright . Lynch called the animal warden , and the cat was soon incarcerated at the local police station , where it hissed at its captors . Three hours after catching the cat , the cops carried it off to a firing range and dispatched it with a shotgun . <P> Wilson sued the police , and the court ruled in his favor , for there is an ordinance that animals have to be held five days before being disposed of . It awarded Wilson $40 for his cat plus $5,000 in punitive damages , thus teaching the police that there is more than one way to kill a cat .
