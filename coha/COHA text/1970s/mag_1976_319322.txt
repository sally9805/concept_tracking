HIGH STAKES by DICK FRANCIS 201 pages . Harper &; Row . $7.95 . <P> Ross Macdonald has his Southern California , Simenon his Paris . In much the same way , and with comparable surety , Author Dick Francis , 55 , has made the turf his own . An ex-jockey and veteran of 2,300 steeplechases , Francis has produced a string of suspense novels ( Blood Sport , Odds Against ) set in the alternately grand and seedy world of British racing-where society 's highest and lowest commingle and it is sometimes hard to tell which is which . <P> High Stakes , the author 's 16th book , is built out of elements by now familiar to Francis addicts-and evidently none the less gripping for wear . This novel of fers a softspoken , faintly eccentric hero and two villains of inexhaustible malignity . The love interest is a well-manicured miss of the type that used to be brought home to mother . There is a large supporting cast of horses . <P> Horseshoe Hard . Steven Scott , 35 , is a wealthy inventor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his profits into racing . He discovers that Jody Leeds , his trainer , and Bookmaker Ganser Mays have bilked him out of 35,000 . Unfortunately , Scott can not prove to anyone 's satisfaction but his own that his horses always lose when he places the largest bets on them , and Leeds threatens to sue for slander if this accusation is ever breathed aloud . <P> In trying to foil and unmask the scheming bookie and trainer , Scott is convincingly roughed up and nearly loses both his Lamborghini and his life . And he pulls off an elaborately improbable shell game involving not two but three nearly identical black horses . <P> As is his custom , the author throws in some technical arcana from a field unrelated to racing - in this case , the design and tooling of toys . If Scott 's marvelously complex and intriguing inventions for children do not exist , they ought to . The customary Francis love scene is oddly old-fashioned and straightforwardly sentimental , but about his own chief love the man is hard as a horseshoe . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he writes as High Stakes crosses the finish . May be not . But there are those who expect the annual Dick Francis entry as eagerly as they await the Grand National or the call to the post at Churchill Downs . Paul Gray
