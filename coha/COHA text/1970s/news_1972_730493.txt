txt China is preparing a collective system of leadership to succeed its aging revolutionaries , Mao Tse-tung and Chou En-lai . After a jarring internal power struggle , it is seeking a period of calm and stability at home and is striving to project an image of relative mellowness in foreign policy . These impressions , garnered during a visit to the . People 's Republic of China , were underlined by Premier Chou En-lai himself in a marathon session with American newspaper editors lasting into the small hours of the morning . Premier Chou expressed cordiality toward the United States but allowed as how neither he nor Communist Party Chairman Mao Tse-tung , who is studying English , are planning American visits . His jabs were reserved for the Soviet Union , whose leaders and policies were the subject of several scathing criticisms . This accords with diplomatic and other expert analyses that the Soviet Union now has become China 's enemy No. 1 . Shelters constructed During a visit to Peking University last week I saw students building air-raid shelters alongside dormitories . Air-raid-shelter construction was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news agency , Hsinhua , and is continuing inconjunction with Peking 's subway system . However , Chinese officials stress that these are purely defensive measures against Soviet attack . Premier Chou carefully painted a picture of China as nonexpansionist and outlined a gradual and transitional timetable for the reintegration of Taiwan with the mainland presumably intended to allay the fears of Taiwan 's non-Communist people . The interview took place this past weekend in the Fukien Room of the Great Hall of the People , a high-ceilinged salon covered with a seemingly endless expanse of rich , rose-colored carpet and hung with misty scenes of the exquisite Chinese countryside . Pauses for tea Premier Chou was dressed in a dark gray , high-buttoned tunic of traditional Chinese cut , adorned only by a small rectangular Mao Tse-tung button . The interview , with a 22-man delegation from the American Society of Newspaper Editors , began at 10:30 at night ( Peking time ) and continued , with interruptions for green tea , Chinese sweetmeats , pastries , and hot face-towels , for 3 hours and 40 minutes until 2:10 the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning to wilt , Premier thou appeared as spritely as throughout the interview and announced cheerfully that he intended to go on and finish the rest of his day 's work . He exchanged badinage about various American newspapers and personalities . The Toronto Globe and Mall Chou : man in charge At one stage , paying tribute to the diplomatic skill of Henry A. Kissinger , he said the presidential adviser was a man who could talk for 30 minutes without revealing a single fact . He faulted the American newspaper delegation for its all-male composition and said that a return delegation of Chinese journalists to the United States would include women . // *China plans post-Mao era // He also indicated that on the Chinese side the initiative for rapprochement with the United States came from Mao Tse-tung himself and that Chairman Mao prodded his subordinates to move more forcefully than they had proposed on the ice-breaking invitation to an American table-tennis team to visit China . Premier Chou refused to reveal the whereabouts or status of the disgraced former head of state , Liu Shao-chi , He spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's designated successor , Lin Piao , reported earlier by Chinese sources to have been killed in an air crash in Mongolia . But by agreement these remarks can not be reported until receipt of an official transcript in a few days time . Clearest indication that Chairman Mao and Premier Chou are looking to collective leadership to succeed them came when Premier Chou said the " very fact of making only one successor to Mao " had been a " plot " of Lin Piao . If one looked closely , said Mr. Chou , one could see there were " tens of millions of successors " to the early revolutionary leaders . Commenting on gaps in the Chinese Communist Party 's Politburo and Central Committee following the political purges of the " cultural revolution , " Mr. Chou said that though there might be a paucity of leaders well known abroad , there were in fact many able individuals in the " leading strata . " We are , he said , " making special efforts to see middle-aged and younger men get leading posts at earlier ages . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good deal of fluidity still in China 's leading ranks . Of five members of the Politburo 's standing committee , only Chairman Mao and Premier Chou are left . Of 21 members of the Politburo , only 10 are left . The Central Committee has been decimated and many ministerial positions are vacant . First step in a program to plug many of these holes would be summoning of the national People 's Congress , but there is no hint that that is about to take place . Clash assumed It is generally assumed that Chairman Mao and Premier Chou on the one hand clashed with Lin Piao on the other when Marshal Lin brandished the power of the Army . This was dangerous heresy in Maoist terms , which hold that the Army is always subordinate to the party . In foreign policy , Marshal Lin is alleged to have opposed the Mao-Chou plan for detente with the United States. - Marshal Lin lost out . But although the losers in China 's power struggle now seem plain , less clear are the ultimate victors who will rule China once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is for this transitional period that collective leadership now is planned . Economy capitalistic Premier Chou spoke at some length about the initial kind of administration the Communists would impose upon the Nationalist-held island of Taiwan . Peking claims Taiwan as an integral part of the People 's Republic . Taiwan 's economy is a thriving capitalistic one and the Pre mier conceded that it would not be possible " immediately " to make it conform to China 's Communist system . He proposed a step-by-step prograth . After China 's Communist take-over in 1949 , he pointed out , the Communists had for the first seven years kept in business those capitalistic enterprises required by the national economy . He claimed that for 10 years thereafter , the Communists had paid capitalist owners 5 percent interest on their capital . After 1966 , he said , the Communists had kept on capitalist owners but paid them salaries as employees of the state . He suggested a similar plan for Taiwan and said : " Maybe there are even more steps in this gradual transition , but I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be abolished ? Premier Chou said the People 's Republic was fully capable of assuming Taiwan 's annual budget of $800 million . " Once we take over , " he said , " we will not increase the burdens of the people there . " This was presumably a hint that China would abolish taxes , in line with economic policy on the mainland , and finance services and development by subsidy in lieu of taxation revenue . The Chinese leader sought to allay fears that his country 's vast population might cause it to " expand outwards . " Despite the worst drought in Northern China for nine years this year , he said , China would reap a satisfactory 250 million tons of food grains this year . It could improve its facilities for grain storage and also develop additional land within its borders . He said land presently under cultivation in China totaled only 12 to 13 percent of the total . He spoke warmly of developing Chinese-American relations and promisingly of increasing exchanges of scientists , journalists , and so forth . However he said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posed obstacles to the establishment of resident American correspondents in Peking . Soviet actions hit The Soviet Union was the target of his sharpest thrusts . Soviet actions along China 's borders he described as provocative . He was disparaging on a number of occasions about their intelligence system . In analysis of China 's internal political system , he said jovially , the " CIA branch in Hong Kong " was ahead oftheSoviet Union , " whose methods are rather poor , even though their embassy in Peking is the largest , and they have the greatest number of cars . " In summation the Prime Minister 's interview seemed to confirm the interpretation by many foreign observers of two important Chinese policy statements in recent days , namely the National Day editorial of Oct. 1 and the Oct. 3 speech at the United Nations by Chiao Kuan-hua , leader of the Chinese delegation . The consensus is that the policy statements established the Soviet Union as China 's principal enemy , were remarkably mild toward the United States and sought to downgrade the personality cult of Maoism in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
