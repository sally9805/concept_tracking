 | Powered parafoil-everyman 's flying machine ? @# I felt a lot as Wilbur Wright must have felt as he jogged alongside the odd-looking machine brother Orville was flying into history . Seventy-five years after that historic flight , I found myself jogging alongside another odd-looking flying machine as it bumped down a weedy runway . John Nicolaides , inventor of the powered parafoil , was preparing to run the hundredth flight test of his unique flyer . Nicolaides had enlisted my aid when I visited his laboratory at California Polytechnic , where he is chairman of the aeronauticalengineering department . I 'd heard that he had developed an inexpensive , safe flying machine ? but I was not prepared for the radical device I was soon to see buzzing about the hills , looking like a mosquito with a parasol . The flight began with shouts of " Switch on ! " and " Contact ! " A helmeted Nicolaides sat in the seat of the three-wheeled flivver as a technician yanked on the propeller . After a couple of pulls , the small engine roared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to make sure the shroud lines leading to a large nylon canopy behind the machine did not foul . Thumbs up Holding the lines , I dutifully trotted down the runway beside the little craft as it gathered speed . pass over the hills , then brought the machine easily to earth , with the parafoil flaring out like the wings of a landing bird . Flying air mattress The parafoil Nicolaides uses is basically a square parachute shaped like an airfoil . The multichambered envelope is stitched from standard nylon parachute cloth , but is left open along the leading edge . When launched into the sky , ram air from the parafoil 's forward motion inflates it . The resulting shape provides lift , as does any airfoil . The original concept was the brainchild of aerodynamicist Domina Jalbert . Kiteflyers ? scientists as well as sportsmen ? use parafoils PS , Mar. ' 72 ; so do skydivers PS , Aug. ' 71 and military paratroopers . But Nicolaides is the first to hang a propeller-driven cart from a parafoil to convert it into a low-speed flyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he chaired the aerospace-engineering department at Notre Dame . With funding from the Navy , Coast Guard , and Air Force , he developed a variety of uses for the parafoil , ranging from lifting cargo to retrieving remotely piloted vehicles . But much of his time went into the powered parafoil . When I visited his lab I saw a half-dozen versions of the flyer Nicolaides had built while developing the concept . Each had a bucket seat supported by a framework of metal struts , a small engine , and a belt-driven wooden propeller . The latest version of the flyer uses a 55-horsepower snowmobile engine . Traumatic tests During the years he was developing the flyer , Nicolaides quite literally risked his own tail . In one jarring crash , he broke his coccyx , and for three months had to carry around a doughnut-shaped pillow to use for sitting . " The early mistakes just came from ignorance , " he told me . " I overcontrolled on a number of occasions , causing the flyer to come Continued @#  | The lines became taut in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breeze and wafted upward , held down only by the two students running behind . They let go and the parafoil slowly rose into place above the machine . With a thumbs-up signal , Nicolaides gunned the craft and it . waddled away down the runway as rosswind blew the parafoil back I forth . Abruptly , the machine swooped into the sky , skimming ( r the brush at the end of the - away . Nicolaides banked into a m and sailed off above the rich California farmland , the craft looking like a toy in the distance . A rious heron flapped lazily up to r at the intruder in his domain . The flight was an excellent of the craft 's airworthiness , for swirling breezes and rising thermals among the hills made fo challenging ride . But the fly machine was equal to them , rid gently up and down as it flew . There was a bit of aerobatics when Nicolaides came in foi landing . He touched down on runway , decided he was not ha ' with the approach , and quit gunned the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anot  | in too hard . There were also times when the parafoil was just not rigged correctly . When I figured it out , the answer seemed obvious . " He still remembers his first good flight . It was in 1974 , flight number 76 . In the previous 75 flights there had been 45 crashes , so Nicolaides was ready for trouble . He had taxied about 100 feet when he saw the cloth wing behind him filling with air . Gunning the engine , he felt the little craft leap upward . An astounded Nicolaides found himself at 1000 feet almost immediately , soaring like a bird over the Indiana cornfields . " I was shocked , absolutely startled . The machine had just jumped into the air within a few hundred feet , when it would take 1000 or 2000 feet for a regular aircraft to get off the ground . " After that first flight at Notre Dame , and later at Cal Poly , Nicolaides , his colleagues , and his students refined the concept . " We designed for better and better aerodynamics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system , " he said . " The parafoil flyer is a highly integrated design , in which everything affects everything else , which is why we caution people against putting together their own . " Easy flyer The flyer is simpler to operate than a motorcycle , claims Nicolaides The engine throttle controls the altitude : Opening the throttle moves the flyer up ; closing it moves it down . A T-bar in front of the pilot is attached to a rudder behind the propeller ; turning the bar to the right moves the craft to the right , ( same with left ) . If the rudder becomes inoperable , the parafoil can be steered by pulling on the left or right shroud lines . " Flying the parafoil flyer is like sitting in an easy chair in midair , " Nicolaides told me . " After experiencing the flyer , I hate to travel in light planes any more . I feel all confined . " Because of the vehicle 's light weight and the parafoil 's large surface area , the machine rises and falls with air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind gusts or other oscillations . " Whenever I get a gust , I just let the flyer bounce , and it settles down immediately , " he said . " If the motor quits in midair , you have essentially a glider that can take you for miles , allowing you to choose a landing place . " Still , I thought to myself , there 's something a little scary about depending on a big piece of cloth for lift when airplanes need precisionengineered frameworks to maintain the wing shape . When I mentioned my doubts , Nicolaides contended that the parafoil is actually more rugged than traditional wings . " If you break a structural member on a wing , you 're gone , but the paraf oil has no rigid structural members . It 's maintained by the positive pressure at the leading edge , which will always exist as the parafoil glides forward . We had one contract with the Air Force in which we used a paraf oil for target practice . Even shot full of holes it flew quite well . " Flying flivvers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government money , it will most likely be first used by the military . The flyer could , for example , take over many of the reconnaissance jobs now performed by helicopters . But the flyer also has great potential for civilian use . In a back room of his lab , Nicolaides showed me one possible development ? a " suitcase flyer . " None of its pieces @# 86 POPULAR SCIENCE Open leading edge of multi-chambered airfoil is shown in head-on view ( left ) . Triangular flaps attach to shrouds for equal stress distribution . @# was more than two feet 1 Unbolted , the entire flyer , inclining engine and parafoil , fits two large suitcases . " The flyer weighs about pounds , and we have n't even be to investigate the new , lighter ma rials that could bring the we ' down further , " Nicolaides told " Such flyers could make one hell a change in civilian flying . For few thousand dollars we could out a machine that could be asse bled in a weekend and could driven to work in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fly , would simply take the parafoil out . lay it on the ground behind you , get in , and gun the engine . The parafoil rises off the ground , like a kite , and you 're off ! " Sport and commuting represent the most obvious applications , but Nicolaides sees a number of other possible uses . Mail delivery , for example , might be speeded up . " It seems inefficient to land mail by airplane , load it into trucks , and then have the trucks drive across country to post offices , " he said " An unmanned , radio-controlled parafoil could deliver mail directly from an airplane 's cargo bay to a post office roof . " Nicolaides ' desk is piled high with letters requesting flyers Though he is currently concentrating on military uses , he does plan to market the flyer commercially as soon as manufacturing , arrangements are worked out . When can we expect flocks of powered parafoils to soar across the sky ? Soon , Nicolaides hopes . He believes the flyer is safe , cheap . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T did for autos . And Nicolaides , whose name means " winged victory " in Greek , would like to be the Henry Ford of the skies .
