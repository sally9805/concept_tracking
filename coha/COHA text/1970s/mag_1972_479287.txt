IF YOU SPOKE TO ME on the streets of New York , you would assume that I was middle class , for there is nothing in my speech or mannerisms that assigns me to the despairing underclass of that city . As far as I can remember , my family on the lonely , volcanic island of St. Vincent was never destitute . We knew who we were , and we knew that in the social hierarchy of the island we had a secure place . My father was a self-made man . In his youth he had emigrated to the prosperous Dutch island of Curacao , and there he must have nourished his West Indian parsimony ; after a few years he returned to St. Vincent with enough money to build a stone house and buy a bus . He was called , then , " Pretty Boy Coombs , " for he was a striking figure , 6 feet 4 inches , handsome , self-assured , and given to wearing sailor caps and scarves in the tropical sun . He drove his bus with the certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to make his way , and soon he had other buses and drivers to drive them . By the time I reached puberty , my father and mother operated a retail store and planted arrowroot , sugarcane , and bananas on several acres of fertile land that they owned . As my father prospered , his name changed from " Pretty Boy " to " Big Man , " and as his stomach rounded , he assumed the position of town oracle . He would give advice on marriages , land disputes , and illegitimate children ; he would counsel cuckold husbands and regale his contemporaries with ribald jokes . The people in the town loved him , I think , because his laughter was like theirs and his pleasures very simple . He once told me that he had no inclination to do what other middle-class West Indians then loved to do , which was to make a grand tour of England . He could dream , he said , whenever he wanted to that he was standing in front of Buckingham Palace , and that dream cost him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my mother 's proddings , and even those lacked style . When he bought the first two-toned four-door Chevrolet on our island and hired a chauffeur to drive us around on weekends , lie did not hesitate to tell the man to pick up other passengers along the way and to charge them a dollar for the ride . On that tiny island , middle-class black parents wanted their progeny to do well in school ; to become men and women of whom they could be proud . They wanted us to believe in the efficacy of family life , to have respect for our elders and faith in God 's ultimate goodwill . They assumed that their children would never marry Orde Coombs is the author of Do You See My Lco.e . For You Growing ? to he published this spring by Dodd , Mead . below their class , and , floating as they did within the Western ambit , many hoped that their children would " marry light . " We were a privileged black group , and we did not have much feeling for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or the odd dollar , I suppose , but we could not conceive of them rapidly changing their station . We believed that the poor would always be with us , and we expected their overwhelming gratitude if we noticed them . N THE SUMMER OF 1960 , a group of I Choate students came to St. Vincent . They were on a goodwill trip to extol the decency of American democracy . We had never before entertained American students , although even then we had had our fill of those white American tourists who found our thatched houses " quaint " and our frangipani " fabulous . " But these young men had a certain easiness of manner , and because we had been raised under the regimentation of a pseudo-British grammar school , wr could not help but admire them . The were brash , spoke back to their teacher , talked about masturbatior and abortion , and in four days trier to tell us how to run our school . When one boy found out that planned to go the following year tr the London School of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yale He was sure that 1 would enjoy the American university , and that would be fascinated by America ' wealth . " The good life is in the Unite ( States . " he said . " I 've been to En gland three times , and many peopl there are underfed . " And so , in 1961 I came to America . Another of the students , the son of a famous television star , invited me to spend a few days with his family at their estate in Rye , New York , before I went to New Haven . The day after I arrived , we went to Harlem . Someone had asked me to deliver a package of West Indian herbs to an ailing cousin , and my host drove me there . It was a hot September day . Children were jumping rope while listless adults sat and stared at us as we parked . We walked up the four flights to the tenement apartment . and when we came down fifteen minutes later , the car 's back window had been smashed ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We asked if anyone had seen the culprit , and were told by everyone sitting in full view of the car not ten feet away that they had seen and heard nothing . I tried to smooth my rage , for I thought I was being made a fool of . With as much dignity as I could muster , I got in the car , as my friend smilingly said : Now you 've seen Rye , and you 've ; een Harlem . You 've almost seen America . " I did n't quite know what he meant : hen , but three days later I was to - eniember his remark when on our Nay to New Haven we turned off the ferritt Parkway at the Dixwell Ave-me exit . As we got closer to Yale , he black slum got worse until sudlenly , a stone 's throw away from that ' etid , garbage-strewn avenue , the lark and beautiful neo-Gothic towers ) f Morse and Stiles colleges thrust heir way into that autumn sky . Such uxtapositions of white wealth and Mack poverty I could understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself to believe that they existed in imerica , the vehement proselytizer of lemocracy . T HERE WERE FOUR black Ameri- cans in my class of more than , 000 , and one invited me to spend be Easter vacation with him in Washagton . I had told him that all the lacks I had seen so far had been 00r . " I know all about the rich singers , " had remarked , " and I have seen . co slums what about those in etween ? " It was in Washington , len , that I first met black middle-lass Americans . Right away I began ) feel a certain uneasiness , a sense tat I had not really escaped the ghtness of my own little island . It did not take me long to find out that in the Northeast many of the black bourgeoisie know each other , party together , and spend their summers in the quiet comfort of Highland Beach on Chesapeake Bay , in Oak Bluffs on Martha 's Vineyard , and in Sag Harbor , Long Island . Most of the young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ League schools or to Howard University or to Stanford . All were sons and daughters of the black professional class . Everyone had a car . No one had any friends in the black slums , and with the exception of making quick visits to poor relatives or picking up late-night snacks of ribs or chicken , my new friends stayed well away from the sprawling ghettos of Washington . I began to see , too , that there was a kind of ambivalence on the part of my peers as they faced their poor , uneducated brothers . They did not actually dislike the slum dwellers , but they feared their unpredictability , their refusal to live by " acceptable " codes . One spring night , I sat with my middle-class friends in the backyard of a very comfortable Washington home . We had hamburgers and steaks and a very warm feeling of camaraderie . The nephew of a famous black writer was also a guest in that house . The young man had been reared in comfort , and he took great pride in his uncle 's accomplishments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his uncle 's fans were whites who relished his tales of pseudo chivalry but did not know that their author was black . The young man had been menaced by four youths when he stopped at a light on 14th and U Streets . They had wanted him to empty his pockets , but he had gunned his car and escaped . Now in the safety of this bourgeois backyard , he vehemently denounced the " hooligans " who were making life difficult for everybody . Was there any way he could help these " hooligans , " I wondered ? He said no : " We have nothing in common but a black skin , and mine is not really black . They are barely existing while I am busy living my life . " I agreed that there were two distinct modes of behavior between poor blacks ? and his peers . But , I asked him , did he not see that it was only luck that separated his moneyed existence from that of the despairing people in the noisome ghettos ? He could n't help that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sympathy lavished on ghetto people . 26 Nobody ever spoke of how miserable " these people " made his life , since he always had to prove to white people that he was different . A LMOST TEN YEARS LATER , after the black pain and tumult and victories of the Sixties , after all the rhetoric of black unity and power , I heard the same sentiment expressed last summer in Oak Bluffs . The speaker , a sixtyish , once-beautiful schoolteacher whose mouth had grown slack from too much Johnny Walker Red with a touch of lemon peel , railed against the poorer blacks who come to Martha 's Vineyard for a weekend of revelry . As we sat among the pines and flowers of her garden , she said , " We are very , very down on what I call the rooming-house types . They own nothing , and they come up here with weekend money to upset our equilibrium . " There was , I gathered , peace and quiet on her part of the island until these blacks came . And although all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give all black people a had name . This woman , a charming lioatez. , s , lived a life of relative ease , and wanted the whites who gazed on her to know with absolute certainty that she was not like those other people with black skins . Her venom was not really all that difficult to understand . In the decade since I " became " an American , I have come to realize that it is the charade of integration that sparks these outbursts of indignation from middle-class blacks . The young man and the older woman saw themselves as standard-bearers for the race , and they knew that the poor black with his split infinitives could only he a symbol of equality in white-liberal drawing rooms . They knew that they too were symbols . And this caused their gorges to rise , for in education , money , and achievement they were , perhaps , no different from the whites who so identified them . It was the dichotomy , therefore , of wanting to be released as totems of admiration ? yet knowing that until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue to see them as extraordinary ? that caused their bile to overflow . They did not see that they had allowed whites to define them and chart their behavior . They did not understand that the proper measure of themselves could only be taken iron their pour black brothers and tha only the eyes of the ghetto would trul reflect their humanity . I know all thi ; because I too indulged for a time it the foolish pastime of trying to con vince whites of the humanity o : blacks . I would be sharp and win ) and charming at white cocktail par ties . I would become for the evenin the Ivy League black buffoon in resi dente . I considered it my duty to mee as many whites as I could and k overwhelm them with my intelligence What did it matter if I left with o throbbing headache and stumble ( ' home to Anacin and Alka-Seltzer : What if my mind boggled at asinine questions and vapid assumptions ? I was in there slugging , doing my Lill for the cause . With little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? lege nights spent trying to persuade two young men from Macon , Georgia , of the validity of black people 's lives . They were both wealthy , and considered themselves aristocrats . One was in my French class . Every question he missed , I answered . I made sure of this by studying French grammar late into the night . And to what avail ? To convince one Southerner that a black man knew more French than he did . And what good did this do ? None . For until he went to medi. cal school in the North , he was eon vinced that his maid , who said she could n't stand Martin Luther King Jr. , was a true reflection of black Southern sentiment . And he was con vinced that learning was a most diffi cult task for blacks . How I regre those useless energies spent under the banner of integration : how mud more fruitful it would have been to test my identification with the ghetto Hack and to learn that resilience ant hardiness from him that no school can teach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call to black unity , new kind of black bourgeois duplicit : has set in , for the middle-class blacl can now seem relevant to the blacl struggle , while remaining aloof Iron the battle . It has become fashionabl for blacks to say that they are in volved in helping other blacks . I myriad of organizations understaffed underfinanced , and manned by th black bourgeoisie are indeed tryin to rekindle black hope . But I wonde if the past is really past . When I corr mented recently on the expensive clothes of a colleague who worked with the poor , 1 was told : " l'm getting mine now . It 's not that I 'm selling out my soul , it 's just that I 'm bettering my body . " Last summer , during a weekend in Sag Harbor , I spoke to the bright and pessimistic wife of one of the growing cadre of black bourgeois problem-solvers who traipse from city to state to federal agency talking about " the needs of the people . " She felt that they approached the ghetto not as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in seeing a job done . " They talk about helping , " she said , " and they feel a bit more guilty than their fathers in being so openly materialistic . But they can not really identify with poverty . All these young management blacks have become white liberals . " Later she invited me to a beach party . As I sat in a summer night 's calm and watched the embers from ten moonlight cookouts glowing along the white beach , my bourgeois friends rapped about how their attempts to help poor blacks had been met with hostility and scorn . The impenetrable communications barrier sapped their energies to the point where they longed to escape from the very people they supposedly wanted to help . And then someone said : " We 're going to have to leave the real work to our children . They are the ones who have always lived with black consciousness , and they will make all black people one . " And another , his voice shaking with emotion , said : " We 've got to build the economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belts , they can take up the fight for all black people . " I listened that night as black people pledged their children to the black nation while they remained safe and on the periphery of danger . Did they think they could ever accumulate enough money in America so that their children would be able to spend their lives making philanthropic gestures to other blacks ? And what of the present ? Must we wait until tenyear-olds grow up before we throw off the crutch of class and move en masse toward real unity ? As the chatter died down , I asked a doctor , an old internist , if he thought that his peers should be redirecting their efforts toward the black poor . He said , no , then his face grew somber : " Have 30 you thought about how hard we have had to work for what little we have ? We can not lead , Mr. Coombs , because we are tired people . And no one wants us to lead because we have sold out too often . So we spend our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other . and we get drunk together . They say the younger guys are closer to their consciences , and that they will work with the poorer Negroes , but I do n't believe it . What I do believe is that in this country all middle-class Negroes are fucked up . " A THE ENO OF THAT long weekend there was in me a heaviness that would not go away , a feeling that in a time of challenge and danger these former integrationists are now floundering in their own indecision . They have not yet fully realized that no matter how agonizing the differ . ences of style , a tight coalition with their brothers in the horrible slums is vital to their ultimate security . For there is no security for blacks in individual success ; there is no escape from the seething underclass and therefore no way to avoid the political maelstrom . At no small cost to their psyches , these middle-class men and women have won a measure of American comfort . But the work , the sweat , the numbing effort they have put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had it not been for the racist crunch of their country , they would have by now tasted wealth . Yet they still find that they must work hard and scrimp on some necessities in order to keep up their posture of wealth , their pretense that they are free from financial stress . It is not difficult to understand why the black bourgeoisie should seek privacy and each other 's company . But if there was ever a time when the black masses ? bereft of leadership , dulled by dope , by unemployment , by an official national policy of disregard and disrespect ? needed the talented bourgeoisie with their degrees and their expertise , it is now . Many of these gifted people , however , seem to wallow in self-pity ; and cursed as Oreos by the militants , they no longer want to fraternize with the white middle class . Today , the middle-class black man is , perhaps , the most disturbed of all black men . He is in limbo , and will remain there until he clearly begins to see that the destiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T 9-1 FIE MATERIAL COMFORT of tl Northeastern middle-class bla. is , in 1972 , a direct result of the urb : fires of the North and of the blat Southerners who marched ( let ( minedly along their dustscapes al gave a semblance of change to th country . The thirty-to-forty-year-o black who holds down a good job the North must know that his prese success is a direct result of pa tumult . All his talent , all his elfo would not have otherwise given him toehold in television , in eonsultir firms , in brokerage firms , in adverti ing , and in publishing . If he doub this , he ha : only to look around ar see how small his numbers are ar how quickly the thrust to rem blacks has abated . Many of these black men know th ; they owe their livelihoods to the poorer , more militant brethren . The know , too , that with all the rnarchim the rioting , and the dying , the rel. tive condition of most black peop has not greatly improved . In foe only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and that the middle class . Seizing the momei of noisy change , armed with the efti cation that they had wondered hu they would use , they immediate ) managed to alter their econom status . If this is true , then the middl class blacks owe a debt to their poi brothers that mere benevolence ca not repay . The only way to cancel th debt is to try to lead the weary , ti dispossessed , out of their morass . I ea hear the chorus of middle-class ou rage : " Oh , but we have tried . We a. the ones who bring the lawsuits , wl hold the benefits and the Nights Excellence for the Urban League . " am not impressed . Though some inc viduals have , at great personal cos assumed the mantle of black ma leadership , most bourgeois blacl have cloaked themselves in recondi chatter about change and left the hat task of organizing to those less ti ented than they .
