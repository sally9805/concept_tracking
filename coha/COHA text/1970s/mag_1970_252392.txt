An article in February 's The Sciences , magazine of the respected New York Academy of Sciences , proposes that we are what we eat : " Thus when a person exclaims , ' Boy , do I feel like a steak today ! ' he may mean it quite literally . He may feel exactly like a large slab of meat : soft , raw , heavy . " That digested , the article proceeds to other insights into " the relationship between eating habits and personality traits . " <P> Take asparagus . " Subjects who spontaneously attack and eat the tip first are likely to be immature , fearful and dependent , unable to-defer gratification even briefly .

" Then there is the matter of eggs : " Several of the students , speaking of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really been born yet . " <P> Entitled " Freud Eggs , " the article has all the appurtenances of the learned-journal genre : discussion of control groups , statistical evidence , impressive phraseology ( " the egg syndrome , " " sensory food stimulator " ) , citations ( Journal of Ontogenetic Orthopsychology ) , cross-references ( " see ' Starving the Brain , ' The Sciences , Nov. 1968 " ) . The piece has elicited calls from doctors and scientists eager but unable to trace its sources . Small wonder : like everything else about the article , the sources are fictitious . <P> " Eggs " was whipped up by Sciences Staffer Harry Atkins with the full knowledge and encouragement of Editor Margery Barnett-who two years ago published another Atkins put-on , " Summer Migrations , " a pseudo-analytical piece on vacationing Americans . Says Miss Barnett : " Once in a while it 's nice to run something to get us out of the groove of reporting straight science . "                @ @ @ @ @
