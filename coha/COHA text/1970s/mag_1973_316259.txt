The first reports out of Wounded Knee , S. Dak. , suggested that history had been hijacked by a band of revisionists armed with a time machine . <P> The tiny junction settlement ( pop . 40 ) is the site of the infamous massacre of some 300 old men , women and children of the Sioux nation by the U.S. Cavalry in the winter of 1890 . It was overrun one night last week by roughly 200 armed members of the American Indian Movement ( AIM ) , a militant group best known for its week-long occupation of the Bureau of Indian Affairs in Washington last November . Thus a drama began to unwind at Wounded Knee , deep in an area where there is open tension between mostly impoverished Indians and whites . <P> Death . The protesters set up headquarters in a Roman Catholic church and ransacked a trading post . They took eleven hostages , all Indian residents of Wounded Knee , which lies inside the Oglala Sioux Pine Ridge Reservation , a 1 million-acre stretch of honey-colored hills . The Indians put up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takeover before a contingent of U.S. marshals in turquoise jumpsuits formed a cordon about the area . Some of the people curious and foolhardy enough to wander near the stronghold were met by spurts of gunfire from the hefty Sioux arsenal . AIM Leader Russell Means , an Oglala Sioux who comes from Cleveland , announced to newsmen : " We 've got the whole Wounded Knee valley , and we definitely are going to hold it until death do us part . " <P> Two days later , while rental cars full of reporters and film crews swooshed back and forth in the dust , a helicopter arrived with Senators George McGovern and James Abourezk of South Dakota , accompanied by aides to Senators J. William Fulbright and Edward Kennedy . Shortly before their appearance , the hostages , including one man with a serious heart condition , had been told that they were free to go . All were unharmed and remained-apparently by choice-in Wounded Knee . The two Senators then met at length with AIM spokesmen to discuss grievances . <P> They demanded an immediate investigation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government . The protesters also made a large point of calling for the ouster of the Pine Ridge tribal council president , Dick Wilson . In large part , the takeover reflected civil strife-a power struggle between two competing Indian factions . Facing off at Wounded Knee were moderates , led by Wilson , and the AIM activists , mostly Indians from outside the reservation , led by Russell Means . <P> Over the past year , AIM supporters have gone into a number of communities in South Dakota and Nebraska , seeking to investigate charges of discrimination against Indians . In early 1972 , AIM forced an investigation into the seemingly casual killing in Gordon , Neb. , of a 51-year-old Sioux , Raymond Yellow Thunder , by a group of whites . ( The whites are now out on bond . ) Negotiating in several other communities , AIM won some promises of improved conditions and at least the beginning of a dialogue with usually unfriendly whites . On the other hand , a month ago , in Custer , S. Dak. , AIM 'S tough tactics left a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least 37 Indians arrested . This kind of periodic outburst infuriates many Indians , who condemn the use of violence . One obvious reason : possible gains may be canceled out in the backlash from an angry white majority .
