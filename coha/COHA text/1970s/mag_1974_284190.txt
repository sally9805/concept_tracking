When William Craig , 49 , was Minister of Home Affairs in the defunct Unionist government at Stormont in 1968 , he ordered the Royal Ulster Constabulary to halt the first civil rights march by Roman Catholics through Londonderry . That decision contributed to the five years of violence that soon followed . It also launched " King Billy " Craig , now head of the Vanguard Unionist Party , on an unrelenting war on behalf of Northern Ireland 's Protestants . Throughout " the troubles , " his line has had a one-track consistency : Ulster , he believes , faces a takeover by the Catholic-dominated Republic of Ireland and this can be prevented only if Ulster 's Protestants band together in political and military opposition to union . A soft-spoken lawyer whose voice seldom rises above a whisper , Craig last week talked with TIME Correspondent William McWhirter in his suburban Belfast home , which is still scarred by a recent terrorist bomb attack . The views of King Billy : <P> ON UNIONIST GOALS . We would never form a government that would give Ulster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunningdale the power-sharing agreement was merely the trigger . The real target was the destruction of the Executive . We may not get everything we want , but we 're in a position to stop anything we do n't want . <P> ON ULSTER 'S PROTESTANTS . They 're sturdy individualists with a deep sense of tradition , industrious and keen on moneymaking , but they are prepared to throw it all away if their fundamental beliefs are attacked . Look at the farmers . They poured their milk down the drains in the morning and blocked the roadways in the afternoon . <P> ON NORTHERN IRISH NATIONALISM . If Britain persists in denying democratic rights to its own citizens , matters will be brought to a head , and we 'll ask for negotiation to set up an independent Ulster . We have now put the challenge to Britain that it must govern us as it governs Scotland and Wales . We 're quite happy to do without our own parliament if necessary , provided of course that we would have equal representation in Westminster . We had to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more people began to think that the Protestants would simply let things slide without a protest . The strike has been a sharp reminder to them that that is the last thing we are going to let happen . <P> ON SECTARIAN CONFLICTS . There are two nations in Ulster . It 's wrong to talk of just Protestants and Catholics . The differences are more fundamental than that . The Protestants look upon the Catholics as being a social liability . They present a tremendous social problem because they are far from selfsupporting , and their large family structures , existing on welfare benefits with high unemployment , are subsidized by the Protestant community . It 's a situation I 'm prepared to accept , but it 's the inescapable social and economic problems arising from it that have created too much distrust in the country . The Catholics think they are being deprived , but every effort to close that gap is looked upon by Protestants as an example of special treatment .                @ @ @ @ @
