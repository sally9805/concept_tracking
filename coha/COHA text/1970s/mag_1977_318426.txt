Exactly when the New Testament was written affects the interpretation of every aspect of Christian origins . Biblical scholars generally think that except for eight or nine of the letters attributed to St. Paul , the books were composed between A.D. 70 and the early 2nd century , with one or two even later . Fundamentalists believe every word in the Bible is literally true , but those who hold to " late " dating argue that much of the New Testament was not written by contemporary witnesses and tends to reflect later church views of Jesus and his Apostles . <P> According to the latest earth tremor in New Testament studies , the present scholarly consensus is wrong . John A.T . Robinson , 57 , Anglican dean of chapel and lecturer in theology at Trinity College , Cambridge , declares that all 27 New Testament books were produced in approximately the two decades before A.D. 70 , and that they are the work of the Apostles themselves or of contemporaries who worked with them . Since Jesus was crucified around A.D. 30 , this would mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and early church events . <P> <P> Up There . Robinson has long been one of England 's more distinguished New Testament critics , rather on the conservative side but no literalist on such matters as Christ 's miracles or the virgin birth . He became famous , however , through his 1963 bestseller , Honest to God , which set teacups rattling in many a rectory . Like America 's Episcopal Bishop James A. Pike , he scandalized the pious by belittling " our images of God as a Being ' up there . ' " His book also advocated what was called " the New Morality , " rejecting absolute rules of right and wrong . After he resigned as Bishop of Woolwich and returned to Cambridge in 1969 , Robinson wrote The Human Face of God , which criticized traditional formulations of the deity of Christ , particularly the idea that he preexisted in the Godhead before his birth . <P> Robinson now brings that same independence of mind to his closely reasoned work on chronology , Redating the New Testament ( Westminster ; $15 ) , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Testament ? ( Eerdmans ; $1.95 ) . What drew him into the dating game was the Gospel of John . In the 19th century newly liberated German Bible critics placed the fourth Gospel in the mid-2nd century because of its well-developed theology , but subsequent archaeological finds ( e.g. , the Dead Sea Scrolls and an early fragment of the Gospel ) forced the date back to A.D. 90-100 . Robinson , however , felt even that was " unbelievably late , " since the Gospel makes no mention of the sack of Jerusalem and destruction of the Jewish Temple in A.D. 70 . <P> At that point Robinson accepted the consensus typified by German Critic Werner Kummel 's listing in 1963 ( see chart ) . But , as " little more than a theological joke , " he decided to investigate the arguments on the dating of all the books , a field largely dormant since the turn of the century . The results stunned him . Owing to scholarly " sloth , " the " tyranny of unexamined assumptions " and " almost willful blindness " by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasoning was untenable .
