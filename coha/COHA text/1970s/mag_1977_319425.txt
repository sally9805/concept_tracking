In his famous book The Presidential Character ( Prentice-Hall , $10 ) , Duke University Political Scientist James David Barber classifies Chief Executives starting with William Howard Toft according to the energy they put into the job ( passive or active ) and their feelings about their presidential experience ( negative or positive ) . Based on that , according to Barber , they fit into one of four categories : passive-negative ( Coolidge , Eisenhower ) ; passive-positive ( Harding , Taft ) ; active-negative ( Wilson , Hoover , Johnson , Nixon ) ; and active-positive ( F.D.R. , Truman , Kennedy , Ford ) . TIME asked Barber , who has closely and critically studied Jimmy Carter for three years , to analyze the character of the President-elect . His report : <P> <P> Mr. Carter comes to Washington full of high expectations at a time of low hopes . Some see a Daniel delivered over to the lions of the capital city , crouched to devour his plainness . Some quake before their own image of a Confederate Cromwell , brassy with power , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the Yankees razed Atlanta in the war . And many beyond the Washington swirl have been convinced that whatever else he is , Jimmy Carter is a man of mystery who will continue to engage the political dramatists for years to come . <P> I believe Mr. Carter is less mysterious than he is made out to be . The Johnson-Nixon experience so shriveled our confidence in presidential simplicity that we have become a nation of uneasy skeptics , sure only that Presidents are seldom what they seem and attuned to hear in every little psychological discord the dirge of neurosis . Gerald Ford should have taught us better : that a President can be wrong in important ways without in the least being sick . Jimmy Carter may turn out wrong-is bound to in some ways-but I for one will be surprised if his major troubles grow out of his character . <P> Fragments of evidence from his early home times confirm Carter 's memories of love and challenge , of parents who were " there " in fact and in caring insistence that there were works to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to list among " healthy mental habits " this first one : " the habit of expecting to accomplish what you attempt . " By 52 , he and his folks were finding running for President-with all its frustrations- " the most gratifying , exciting thing we 've ever done . " Like F.D.R. and H.S.T. and J.F.K. , Carter discovered , as child and man , that he could count on sustaining memories as he reached beyond his experience to test his possibilities-and enjoy himself the while . <P> Carter 's transition from child to man is already well documented . His basic political world view probably was gathering itself in those years . A somewhat abstract appreciation of humankind , of the heroism of the everyday life , a little from Tolstoy , a little from Dylan Thomas . A growing sense that history could be nudged-even shoved-with some hardheaded planning and trying , as his own history showed . A slowly smoldering burn against a social order in which blacks had to take white meanness as a given . But in those days he did not say much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
