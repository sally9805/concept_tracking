Democracy has never had much of a place in the concert hall . Conductors and music directors jealously guard their ironclad rule over what to play . And as long as they satisfy the paying customers consistently , they get away with it . Currently , though , the Los Angeles Philharmonic is conducting a three-week experiment in participatory democracy as applied to programming . So far , the results suggest that dictatorship in taste may have its virtues . <P> Starting out at a campus concert at suburban Cerritos College , the orchestra invited the audience to pick the second half of the program from 23 classics . Among them were the Mahler First Symphony and Beethoven 's Third , Fifth , Seventh and Eighth . Even though the audience was composed largely of supposedly hip students , the winners were Ravel 's hoary Bolro and Tchaikovsky 's Romeo and Juliet overture . <P> The experiment soon led to a bit of unseemly partisan politicking . At one concert at U.C.L.A. , members of a local " Schroeder Society " demonstrated for Beethoven , while lads and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passing out " Vote for Gustav " leaflets . When the dust had settled , Mahler was the victor-by a single vote . Analysts pointed out that Beethoven might have triumphed had not his supporters split their vote among the four symphonies . <P> Taking a rather cool view of the whole contest , members of the Philharmonic are running a daily pool on first and second place .                     @x Democracy has never had much of a place in the concert hall .
