" The quality of a civilization , " wrote Yale Law School Dean Eugene V. Rostow some years ago , " is largely determined by the fairness of its criminal trials . " And in mid-July of 1974 , former President Nixon  --  himself a lawyer  --  reacted sharply against what he considered harassment by the news media  --  by declaring that " trial by jury , " not " trial by press , " is the basis for our judicial system . Such pronouncements by sophisticated members of the Establishment reflect the apparently common concern with the form of our system of criminal justice . It is significant , as Justice William 0 . Douglas pointed out in one of his opinions , that most of the provisions of the Bill of Rights are procedural . " It is procedure , " he pointed out , " that spells much of the difference between rule by law and rule by whim or caprice . " It is of at least equal significance that neither procedural safeguards nor the principle of adversary proceedings plays a large role in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The vast majority of criminal cases never come before a jury ; therefore , procedural issues are rarely considered . Indeed , the question of guilt or innocence plays a relatively minor role in the proceedings .

His Process of American Government is widely used in high schools and colleges . position of cases  --  the phrase is that of the courts  --  is usually the result of a haggling process that , in the words of one authority , " is more appropriate for the used-car lot than for the halls of justice . " A spate of cases in recent years has brought the plea-bargaining system into sharp public focus . On March 13 , 1972 , writer Clifford Irving and his wife Edith pleaded guilty four days after having been , indicted by federal and state grand juries on charges of grand larceny , conspiracy , mail fraud and possession of forged documents , ConViction on these charges , stemming from a scheme to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ autobiography of billionaire Howard R. Hughes , could have resulted in a sentence of 100 years for each defendant . Some rather sharp bargaining resulted in a sentence for Clifford Irving of two and a half years and a $10,000 fine ; Edith was to serve two months of a two-year sentence . New York State dropped all charges on the day the Irvings pleaded guilty to the federal charges . Some questions had been involved in the bargaining sessions : Would the prosecution recommend probation in return for a plea of guilty ? Would the authorities intercede with the Swiss Government , which wanted Edith for fraud in connection with her manipulation of , bank accounts ? Would Irving help McGraw-Hill recover the $750,000 involved ? On October 11 , 1972 , Spiro T. Agnew traded the Vice Presidency of the United States for his freedom . He pleaded nolo contendere to a charge of federal income tax evasion  --  only one of a number of charges that had been recommended by members of the prosecutorial staff , working directly under Atty . Gen. Elliot Richardson . He was sentenced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and walked out of court a free man . The bargain had been struck after Judah Best , Agnew 's lawyer , ' argued that Agnew did n't want to involve the nation in " a lengthy , bloody and convulsive battle , " but that his freedom was nonnegotiable . In a sometimes rancorous meeting , Richardson beat down the resistance of top aides to his agreement that no jail sentence would be involved . James R. Thompson of Chicago , who had been called to Washington by Richardson to work on . the case , later said that " I 've never seen a stronger case of bribery and extortion . Jf it had gone to trial , I 'm sure he would have been sent to jail . He was simply a crook . " In February 1974 , four suspects in a $547,000 robbery of the Maryland National Bank at Friendship Airport , were able to strike a profit-sharing agreement with federal prosecutors . A bank teller was unable to identify one of the suspects in a police lineup , and no witnesses could be found to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparently was convinced that the case w ould not stand up in court . After twelve houri of nego-ation in the jail , an agreement was worked out : the ringleader and the two suspected receivers of the stolen money were to be released in return for their agreement to tell - prosecutors and the FBI where $400,000 of the loot could be found . The fourth suspect , a parole violator , received a minimal sentence . The suspects  --  apparently knowledgeable in the art of criminal diplomacy  --  insisted that the contract be approved ' by the judge . An FBI spokesman told reporters , with a straight face , that the THE mum/October 26 , 1974 money was recovered as a result of " good , solid investigative work . " The three suspects walked out of the Maryland courthouse with a profit of $147,000. r , March 1974 , Harry L. Sears , former Republican leader of the New Jersey Senate and chairman of the 1972 Nixon campaign in New Jersey , was granted total immunity from charges of conspiracy , obstruction of justice and perjury in connection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financier Robert L. Vesco . In return , Sears agreed to testify against the bigger fish in the case : former Atty . Gen. John Mitchell and former Secretary of Commerce Maurice Stans . In the same month , Herbert Kalmbach , President Nixon 's personal attorney , pleaded guilty to two charges : a felony charge of soliciting $2.8 million for an illegally formed 1970 campaign committee , and a misdemeanor charge of offering an ambassadorship in Europe in return for a 1972 campaign contribution of $100,000 . Special Prosecutor Leon Jaworski announced that other possible charges had been dropped in return for Kalmbach 's col operation and full disclosure of " all relevant information and documents . " On May 16 , 1974 , former Atty . Gen.lRichard , G. Kleindienst confessed that he " did refuse to answer questions " about the involvement of the President and others in the ITT antitrust suit . In fact , Kleindienst had answered questions  --  but his answers were lies . On conviction of perjury , he would have faced disbarment and the loss of his Washington law practice . Jaworski @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge  --  a misdemeanor  --  because the former Attorney General had " voluntarily disclosed information material to the investigation . " Kleindienst drew a suspended sentence . Such cases make the headlines . But what most Americans do not realize is that plea bargaining has become the rule , not the exception , in the disposition of criminal cases in this country . Neither rules of law and evidence nor principles of due process are invoked , in more than 90 per cent of the cases that result in conviction . Of the 32,103 ' criminal convictions in U.S. District Courts in 1971 , 27,544-86 per cent  --  were reached via negotiated pleas . In the same year , of the 101,000 misdemeanor convictions in New York ' City , more than 98,000 ? about 97 per cent  --  were the result of guilty pleas . In , the majority of such cases , the system does not operate in as benign a fashion as in the cases described above , particularly when the defendants are poor or black . Faced with an overwhelming caseload , the police ; the prosecutors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the framework of the formal system of justice . Operating on an implicit assumption of guilt , the 399 authorities charge a defendant with the maximum offense possible , strengthen their position with a multiplicity of charges , and then bargain with him to accept a lesser charge than the maximum . Why do so many defendants give up their constitutionally guaranteed right to a trial ? To put it crudely , the defendant who insists on his rights may find that he faces additional punishment . First of , all , the chances of conviction are always high in a trial ; of the cases in federal , district courts that went to trial by jury in 1971 , 72.9 per cent ended in convictions . Moreover , the sentences tended to be much more severe in such cases than they would have been had the defendants pleaded guilty . The defendant is frequently advised by his lawyer to " cop , a plea " ? to give up his right to a trial in return for a reduced sentence . Plea bargaining operates in a variety of ways . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reduce the charges that he will bring against the defendant  --  giving prosecutors judicial powers that  --  in theory  --  belong to the courts . In return for guilty pleas , a prosecutor may drop felony charges that involve long jail sentences , and instead press misdemeanor charges . Agnew 's indictment was a case of plea bargaining at the prosecutor 's level . Often the deal is less explicit . All the charges are brought by the prosecutor , but he may agree , in return for a plea of guilty , to communicate to the judge the " cooperation " of the defendant or to " recommend " leniency , as in the Irving case . But even without such assurances , the guilty plea itself tends to soften the sentence . A study some years ago by the Administrative Office of the U.S. District Courts found that defendants in federal courts who had the temerity to insist on their right to a jury trial and who were subsequently convicted could expect to receive sentences about three times more severe than could those who pleaded guilty at arraignment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentences on a number of defendants charged with the same crime . Several defendants  --  all with prior conviction records  --  pleaded guilty . One defendant  --  with no prior record  --  insisted on his innocence and had been convicted by a jury . Those who , had agreed to a guilty plea were sentenced to probation ; the man who had been tried received a three-year jail sentence . The judge justified the differentiation in treatment on the ground that those who had entered guilty pleas " stood conscience-stricken in repentance before the court . " Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz followed up the case some years later and found that the " remorseful " defendants had all been arrested at least once thereafter , while the presumably unrepentant sinner had stayed out of trouble . Stanton Bloom of the Cook County Public Defender 's Office proposed an alternative interpretation to Christian Science Monitor bureau chief Howard James : " That 's the penalty imposed for taking up the court 's time . " Occasionally , especially when the stakes are high , the deal may be quite explicit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Maryland bank- robbery were anxious to have the deal legitimized by a judge ; they were sophisticated enough to know that a tough judge can exercise his 400 prerogative to set aside a prosecutor 's recommendation in a guilty plea . An example of the way the informal bargain can be frustrated by a judge can be seen in a highly publicized plea bargain . Prosecutor Earl Silbert struck a bargain with Watergate defendant E. Howard Hunt 's defense counsel that , if Hunt agreed to plead guilty to three of the six charges originally brought before him , Silbert would drop the other charges . Judge Sirica refused to dismiss the charges , ' however , leaving a discomfited Hunt the option of pleading guilty to all six charges or facing a jury . Hunt chose to plead guilty , but later moved to vacate ? that plea . As a result of Judge Sirica 's action in the Hunt case , the staff of Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox decided , in the cases of Jeb Magruder and Fred LaRue , to bargain before the indictment ; consequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been brought against him . In return for by-passing grand jury action , both agreed to plead guilty to one-count informations ( a prosecutor 's charge is an information rather than an indictment ) . Presumably , part of the bargain included agreements by both Magruder and LaRue to testify in the trials of other Watergate defendants . The system , as has been noted , is designed to keep the courts working and it functions by providing incentives for guilty pleas . Critics maintain that it works at a terrible price : it fails to do what a justice system is supposed to do  --  distinguish between the innocent and the guilty . Indeed , the plea-bargaining process tends to penalize the innocent and reward the guilty . In July 1974 , Frank Donnelly sat stunned in a Sarasota , Fla , courthouse as the man who admitted stabbing him almost to death pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of assault and battery and was set free die was credited with the time he had already served in jail ) . The defendant who knows he is guilty usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge . On the other hand , the defendant who is convinced of his innocence is often under tremendous pressure to accept guilt . A classic case is that of Laurence Blutcher , a black grocery store owner whose misfortunes were described by Eliot Asinof in The People Versus Blutcher . Blutcher contended that he was badly beaten by two police officers when he refused to pay a , weekly bribe . He had been charged with resisting arrest and assault  --  classic " cover charges " designed to protect police officers against potential citizen complaints . The district attorney offered Blutcher the opportunity to plead guilty to disorderly conduct  --  a misdemeanor that would involve no imprisonment and no permanent criminal record . Blutcher indignantly refused . When his case had gone to trial and was proceeding badly , Blutcher 's lawyer con- , vinced him to accept the bargain . Even as his lawyer 7 went up to tell the judge of the change of plea , Blutcher recalled , he thought that he should have stuck it out . ' " I could go to jail knowing I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " but that it was the law that had done the wrong . " But the acceptance of a false guilt was not enough . Blutcher was forced to sweat out a confession , an admission , an insistence under questioning by the judge , that THE NATION/October 26 , 1974 he really was guilty , and that he was not changing his plea out of fear or hope . Blutcher was freed , finally , but Asinof wondered whether the system serves the ends of justice . The filing of criminal charges to " cover " police abuSes , charges civil liberties lawyer Paul Chevigny , is a common device . In his book Police Power , Chevigny cites case after case in which police made arrests to turn potential complainants into defendants . Moreover , the filing of multiple charges is a method of adding to the pressure on the victim of police abuse . Under such circumstances ; it is hard to resist an offer to accept a guilty plea to a misdemeanor . " Many lawyers automatically recommend a plea of guilty to disorderly conduct , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge of resisting arrest . " To a poor defendant , or even one with moderate means , the specter of rapidly mounting legal fees must loom as a major deterrent to insistence on his rights . Self-respect is bought at a high price among the poor . The operation of the bail system may mean that the maintenance of his innocence is more than the indigent defendant can afford . The accused individual who can not raise bail must await trial in , jail . And bail is often set arbitrarily , with little consideration of either the ability to pay or the chances that the defendant may not appear for his trial . A report prepared for the American Friends Service Committee stated that " half of the national county-jail population is composed of untried prisoners . An indigent person arrested for a minor offense does time under brutal and degrading conditions in a county jail even though not convicted of any crime . " Frequently , after he has waited in jail for months , the accused may be urged by his attorney to plead guilty in return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " time served " sentence is another ploy in the pressure tactics applied to force pleas of guilty ; the defendant at this stage can walk out of court a free man , whereas if he continues to insist on his innocence , he may stay in jail for months more awaiting trial . Even if he is finally acquitted , under such circumstances the defendant will have been punished more severely for proving his innocence than he would have been for pleading guilty . There are no records , , of course , on how frequently innocent defendants succumb to the pressure to plead guilty to reduced charges . By the same token , there are no records of how often juries convict innocent defendants . But in the cases that went to trial , the rules of laW were observed . There were adversary proceedings , the guarantees of due process were applicable and the prosecutor was able to convince a jury that the defendant was guilty " beyond a reasonable doubt . " In such proceedings , questionable police practices that subvert the rule of law are exposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A guilty plea , on the other hand , covers up unreasonable searches and seizures , fail-/ ures to warn a defendant of his rights , the use of questionable interrogatory techniques  --  all the police abuses that the Supreme Court has curbed in the past two decades . Yet , despite all its subversi  --  n of the system of justice , plea bargaining is accepted and defended by prosecutors and defense lawyers alike . " Most defense lawyers and prosecutors , " says New York University law professor Peter L. Zimroth , " want to settle cases . The focus of the system is on accommodation , not confrontation and litigation . " Adversary proceedings , the , rule of law , the technicalities of due process are what law students study , in their classes . It is easy to forget that confrontation and litigation lie at the heart of our cirminal justice system .. To many , the most persuasive  --  and morally troublesome  --  defense of plea bargaining is the argument that a deal with a minor defendant may lead to the strengthening of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hope of reducing the charges against them , and the subsequent penalties , that helped persuade many of the Watergate defendants to name higher-ups in the conspiracy . Precisely because it is based on an attractive logic it is easy to overlook the fact that this defense subordinates the means to the end ; while it presumes to promote the principle of law and order , it subverts that of justice . The charge and the penalty for criminal activity are reduced to the status of marketable commodities . Laiv professor Willard Hurst of the University of Wisconsin uses the expression " the substantive importance of procedure " to describe the concept that means shape and even determine ends . The tradition of Anglo-Saxon justice is based on the commitment to the idea that adherence to the means  --  the procedures and the processes of justice  --  will , in the long run , serve the ends of justice more effectively than the punishment of the individual offender . This is the rationale that underlies the cluster of procedural technicalities that we call the Bill of Rights . In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the individual criminal is responsible for his own acts . His guilt  --  or the degree of his guilt  --  is the function of his own action , not of the information that he has available for barter . Most prosecutors argue that the ability to bargain is essential to their work in amassing evidence , especially in the realm of organized crime . It is illuminating to recall that similar arguments were presented by prosecutors in their criticisms of the Warren Court 's decisions in the Escobido and Miranda cases , circumscribing the methods police might use to obtain confessions . At that time , most prosecuting attorneys echoed the complaint of the police chief of Garland , Texas : " We may as well close up shop . " In the years since the Miranda decision , the evidence seems to support the prediction of Nevada Atty . Gen. Harvey Dickerson at the time : the police , he said , would simply have to become more proficient in gathering evidence than in coercing confessions . Some time after Miranda , Los Angeles Dist . Atty . Evelle Younger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between confessions and convictions ; he concluded that confessions were necessary in only about 10 per cent of the cases he handled . " I 'm amazed , " he said . " Like most iiiOsecutors , I had assumed that confessions were of the utmost necessity in the majority of cases . " And a number of studies since Miranda have indicated that , while the confession rate has , indeed , fallen off , the conviction rate has remained relatively stable . These findings sug- gest either that the police have become more professional , or that the weak cases never reach the courts . Some critics have begun to wonder whether , like the old justifications ' for , the coercion of confessions , the argument for the necessity of deals with criminals in order to unearth evidence may not be overstated . The fact is that the practice Of plea-bargaining not only subverts the basic foundations of our system of criminal justice , but  --  from the way it is applied in most cases  --  actually undermines the elements of deterrence on which criminal sanctions are based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less by guilt or by the nature of an offense than by the laws of the marketplace , then the deterrent function has been seriously eroded . The connection between sentence and offense becomes tenuous . Sentences are usually determined , not , by the need to protect society against dangerous criminals or by the need to deter criminal activity , or even the very natural urge to punish those who have offended society 's welfare or sensibilities , but by purely mechanical and bartering considerations : the condition of the court calendar , the vacancy rate in the jails and prisons , the work burden of the prosecutor 's office staff , the efficiency of the local police , the negotiating skill of the defense attorney and his relationship with the judge and the prosecutor . The innocence or guilt of the accused plays a relatively minor role in determining the severity of the sentence . It is plea bargaining , rather than the oft-cited " sof tnes 's " of the courts or the rigid adherence to the procedural protections built into the Constitution , that is responsible for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streets . The other side of the coin is ' that the same process operates to the disadvantage of those who may be innocent of wrongdoing , but who are not able to resist the pressures to cop a plea . Interestingly enough , the judicial systems of most European countries would not permit the unquestioned acceptance ' of guilty pleas . The governments of such countries operate on the assumption that an individual is not necessarily capable of determining his own guilt or innocence . While he may know what he did , degrees of guilt  --  indeed , guilt itself  --  may be determined by answers to questions with which he may not be competent to cope . For example , depending on such factors as motive , state of mind and " reasonableness " of action under the given circumstances , a man who shoots another may be guilty of murder , or he may be guilty of several degrees of manslaughter  --  or he may be guilty of nothing at all . Europeans believe , consequently , that it is the government 's function to investigate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underlying assumption is that the protection of the innocent  --  even against themselves  --  is as much a responsibility of the government as is the punishment of the guilty . Should we adopt the European policy of investigating every case ? Unless we are prepared to make significant changes in our justice system , overwhelming caseloads would make such a policy impossible . Perhaps , , some suggest , the almost simplistically obvious answer to the problem of plea bargaining is the removal of the need to do so : reduce the number of cases by decriminalizing many of the offenses that contribute to the clogging of court calendars . More than half the arrests made in the United States involve offenses against neither the person nor the property of any other individual . The so-called " victimless crimes " that flood our courts and prisons are based for the most part on an attempt to legislate personal morality . They include drunkenness ( about half of all prisoners in American jails have been committed for public intoxication alone ) , drug use ( about 35 per cent of the felony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for violation of the marijuana laws ) , " gambling ( despite the fact that in most jurisdictions , church-sponsored gambling is legal ) and illicit sex ( the laws against which are enforced in a highly selective manner ) . In many localities , it is a crime to keep a store open on a Sunday , to possess material that is deemed pornographic by loCal authorities or to attempt to commit suicide . John Kaplan , a Stanford University law professor , was one of a group of experts called upon to update the statutes of California some years ago . He argued that enforcement of the marijuana laws was stupid . " In an era when it 's not safe to walk the streets of an American city , " he declared , " it 's a waste to have the police spend any time on marijuana . " ( Kaplan was fired from the group by an outraged legislative committee whose chairman said , " . . I 'm worried about the permissiveness in this country today . We do n't propose to enact laws that will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a drain . " ) The court calendars , of course , would not be greatly relieved of serious cases by the decriminalization of victimless crimes . As one authority has pointed out , the drunks who fill the local jails are convicted within minutes . But the decriminalization of such offenses would mean that the efforts of the police could be concentrated on the more serious crimes in our society , and prosecutors could go to court better prepared in the serious cases . The importance of strengthening ' the efficiency of police and prosecutors can better be appreciated when it is recognized that the overwhelming majority of serious crimes in which the prosecutor resorts to plea bargaining are those in which he recognizes that he has a weak case . A recent survey among prosecutors revealed that " a weak case " was cited in 85 per cent of the situations in which prosecutors agreed to accept guilty pleas to reduced charges . There are those who argue that such weak cases should be removed from the control of prosecutors altogether . The report of the American Friends Service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and prosecutors is perhaps the major flaw in our criminal justice system . In addition to the elimination of victimless crimes , the report recommended a series of reforms . Money bail should be eliminated ; everyone awaiting trial would be released , except for those few for whom there is heavy evidence that they might commit violent crimes before trial : Even in such cases , failure to bring the case to trial within a specified period  --  an indication of a weak , case  --  would result in dismissal . 11A11 persons accused of a felony would be brought to trial , regardless of plea . The investigatory agencies of the state  --  crime laboratories , investigators and records  --  would be at the  --  disposal of both sides in the adversary proceeding . All discretionary sentences and indeterminate sentences would be eliminated ; the sanctions for each offense would be clearly fixed by law and imposed uniformly upon convictions The element of discretion in sentencing , the authors of the report believe , tends to operate to the advantage of the rich and powerful and to the disadvantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given the process of plea bargaining by the news media in the Watergate cases has made the American public increasingly aware of the practice , an awareness that can greatly aid any movement to reform . the system of criminal justice . And the recommendation by the National Advisory Commission on Criminal Justice Standards and Goals that the practice be phased out over a five-year period has brought hope to the critics of plea bargaining that the end of the system may be in sight . As both caseloads and publicity about plea bargaining increase , Americans are going to have to make a basic decision . Are we going to choose efficiency  --  an efficiency that some see as self-defeating  --  at the expense of justice ? Or , in the face of evidence that much of the public is profoundly punitive and vindictive , will we have the courage to opt for the application of the generally recognized and highly acclaimed  --  but frequently inoperative  --  principles of our system of criminal law ? ?               @ @ @ @ @ @
