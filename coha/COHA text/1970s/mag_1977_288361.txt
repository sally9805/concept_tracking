How will the Supreme Court finally rule on the Bakke case ? Nobody can predict the result with any certainty , of course , but many of the nation 's legal scholars expect the decision to go against Bakke . A sampling : <P> Theodore J. St. Antoine , dean of the University of Michigan Law School : " If you force me to bet , I 'm going to bet that they reverse the Bakke case and rule against him . . . In my judgment there will be some provisions left open for an affirmative-action program that will allow making race an admissions distinction . The vote might be 6 to 3 , and the majority opinion may be somewhat muddled . " <P> Harry Wellington , dean of the Yale Law School : " My guess is that they will reverse the California Supreme Court and send the case back for reexamination . They likely will say it is permissible to take race into account but a predetermined number or quota may not be acceptable . I would not be surprised if there were as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Gerhard Casper , University of Chicago Law School : " I assume the Supreme Court will try to come down with a very narrow ruling in the Bakke case . But whether it will rule in favor of Mr. Bakke , I just do n't know . The case is one of the most explosive ever , with great implications . The country is not ready to have the case decided yet . The court does not want to impose its will on the people when it will leave a large part of the country unhappy either way . " <P> Bruce A. Ackerman , Yale Law School : " The court will accept benevolent quotas . The basic idea will be that it is permissible for Government to act to redress past grievances . " <P> Derrick A. Bell Jr. , Harvard University Law School : " If the court applies the same standards of proof to Bakke 's claim that it has to civil rights proponents , Bakke will lose . To prove discrimination , you must also show intent to discriminate . The Justices will find that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficiently rational and reasonable way as to require the rejection of a constitutional attack . " <P> Alan M. Dershowitz , Harvard University Law School : <P> " The court will not reach the ultimate issue presented by the case . It 's a terrible case for a definitive ruling , partially because the real parties at interest are not at the bar . "
