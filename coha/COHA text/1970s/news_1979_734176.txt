txt As a campaigner , Prime Minister James Callaghan does n't rush ; he does n't shout ; he does n't panic ; he does n't even pander much to the television cameras . He is the leader of the Labor Party , usually the more radical of Britain 's two major parties , but he is trying to calm people down , not stir them up . The favorite uncle , big , a bit bluff , hearty and reassuring ? that is the image sought . The contrast with Margaret Thatcher , the intense and hectoring Conservative leader , could n't begreater . Watching and listening to Mr. Callaghan in action today , at the daily Labor Party news conference in London and during quick stops in this and two other Lancashire mill towns , you would have thought his party was comfortably ahead in the general election campaign . Decline In Tory Support It is n't . The Tories are still well out in front as the campaign enters its final phase , with the balloting a week from today . But the opinion polls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the party 's top strategists think they may be able to prevent Mrs. Thatcher from gaining more seats in the House of Commons than all other parties combined , even if they ca n't actually overtake her . The latest Gallup Poll , published yesterday , shows the Conservatives ahead by only 5 percentage points , a substantial decline since last week . If they lose more ground , the result could be another hamstrung Parliament , with the minority parties holding the balance of power . Mr. Callaghan has been studying the polls , those conducted for various newspapers and those taken especially for him . A couple of things jumped out at him : Labor was doing badly with women , and voters wanted to hear more about education , pensions and the National Health Service . The Prime Minister is almost as keen a student of polls as was Lyndon B. Johnson . Flanking him on the news conference dais this morning were not the usual Cabinet ministers but two obscure Labor candidates for Parliament , neither of whom is given , the slightest chance of winning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because Mr. Callaghan 's text for the day was " The Importance of the Family . " He - said a few words about healthy families building healthy societies , and then the women said that families needed better education , better pensions and a better National Health Service . No hope of that under the Tories , the Prime Minister declared . Not a word of it appeared tonight on the main BBC news program , which concentrated instead on ? Mr. Callaghan 's reaction to the publication of new statistics showing how serious last winter 's strikes had been . It was not something he enjoyed being reminded of ; the industrial unrest undercut Labor 's claim to be the party that could deal with the trade unions and increased the Tories ' standing in the polls . " I view it as an appalling figure , " he said gamely . But he warned that " cosmetic legal reforms " proposed by the Conservatives in the laws governing unions would only lead to a confrontation and a " return to the foolishness of 1973-75 . " That was when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of the country . Four hours later , the Prime Minister reached Rawtenstall , 170 miles northwest of London . He walked through a super . ? Market , nibbled on an apple and addressed a crowd of about 300 , in the parking lot . He told them . that they had better think twice about voting Tory because the Conservatives would end Government subsidies to the textile and shoe industries , on which the town 's economy de-pends : . A , cloudburst cut short his speech at the - Haymarket Shopping Center ' in Bury , so the Prime Minister moved on to Middleton , where he walked through a shopping mall with the local Member of Parliament , who is also named James Callaghan . Except for the infighting of the cameramen , it was a benign little walk , punctuated by autographs , waVes , smiles , an answer to a question or two and cheery calls of " All the best . " The Prime Minister ended up in another supermarket , and he seized the oc- , casion to make a political point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said to the cameras and mi. , croones , , " and said to the bakers , ' No , you ca n't raise your- prices until we 've finished investigating your profit . margins. ! Vote-Tory and you 'll lose the . Price Coinmissionand the price of bread will go up again . " The whole afternoon tour exemplified one of the Prime Minister 's toughest problems : the ineptitude of the Labor Party organization ; It was an important tour . Each of the places he visited was represented by a Labor M.P . threatened by defeat , and one of them , Michael Noble , won last time by a mere 203 votes . But the visit to Rawtenstall , in Mr. Noble 's constituency , was heralded by not a single poster . The visit to Bury was a candidate 's nightmare , with a feeble public-address system and a platform so ' low that ? many irithe crowd couldii'l see Mr. Callaghan . It could have been held inside instead of outside the shopping center , but apparently no one remembered that it rains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices ' also missed the television broadcasts ; it came too late in the day . . Mrs. Thatcher 's managers , ? however gimmicky their ideas ; do n't make mistakes like that : " You , wonder sometimes , " said a friend of Mr. Callaghan , " whose side the Labor organizers are really op . " The British . press has been as unkind to Mr. Callaghan 's campaign as it - has to Mrs. Thatcher 's . Sheds attacked for lack of substance , he for not *irking very hard . John O'Sullivan of The Daily Tele7 graph wrote that the Prime Minister was campaigning " in aCcordance'with electioneering theories of Greta Garbo . It seems that he wants to be alone . " " Yesterday 's main engagement in this rigorous campaign ; " said Simon Hoggart in The Guardian , " was at the Albany Hotel in Birmingham , where he was due to remain in his room for some six hours . The official reason for this was ' Prime Ministerial .. duties , ' which no doubt include the Prime Ministerial , bite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a catch . If . Mrs. Thatcher has outcampaigned Mr. Callaghan , even though she started later , more and more voters are telling the pollsters that they prefer him to her , regardless ' of their party preferences .
