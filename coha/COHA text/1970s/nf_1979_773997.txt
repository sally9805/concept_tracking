txt // The problem of end-grain in staining is a natural result of the tubular fibres of which wood is made . When exposed in a board end or turning , these fibres suck in more stain and get darker . The denser the wood , the less problem , but it is always there to some extent . The answer is to fill the end-grain before staining with shellac . Brush the shellac freely on the turning then rub off hard with rag dampened with denatured alcohol . Then let the shellac that soaked quickly into the end grain dry before applying stain . You may need two coats ? or thinner shellac ? experimentation is necessary to get the feel of this with different moods . // ing thing about white poplar , and that is that in plank form it has a very strong green streak running through the middle of it . And this can be pretty broad , too . But even with the green streak , it stains up to imitate cherry so well that it was used to make many fake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So never buy a cherry table without looking under it first for signs of this streak as such a table is worth a lot less than the real thing . Another way to tell the difference if the bottom of the top and leaves have been stained or painted is that poplar is a lot heavier than cherry . Now the stain . There is no question but that you are way ahead of the game if you use the fast-drying professional quality stains from one of the catalogue houses listed and discussed in the back of this book . Constantine or Craftsman have these stains , but I have to especially recommend Mohawk , because of the excellent color chart that they supply . And they have so many colors . So you can often find just what you need or at least start out very close , so that only a little tinting of the basic stain is necessary . Naturally this means starting out with a set of stains that corresponds to an artist 's pallet . The basic ones for tinting are the strong shades of : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MAPLE ? for its high content of yellow WALNUT ? believe it or not for the blue in it // and these go into your basic wood colors : brown mahog-any , brownish cherry , regular or palish walnut , the oaks , pines or whatever closest color you have selected from Mohawk 's chart of about fifty different ones . ( And in case you are involved with something exotic , they also have all the basic colors of the spectrum : red , orange , yellow , green , blue , indigo , violet . For memory fiends who want to never forget that list , the first letters of those colors can be thought of as spelling the name of my good friend " Roy G. Biv . " ) The final stain mixing is done this way : you start with ten drops of your basic color and add one or two of the color in which direction you want your basic stain to move . To see what you 've got , you try a brushfull ( about three drops ) of your mixture on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stain . So saving scraps of wood from the making of any replacement part is always a good thing , or you can test on the under-side of a table leaf , back of a leg or drawer-front , etc . And so you just keep fooling around with your little drops of stain until you get to your correct proportion of colors as known in drops . Then you mix up a large amount in that proportion . A couple of more thoughts : I am assuming that you realize that the color of the stain while still wet is the color it will be when a finish i applied to it . In the name of Allah , I beg you ? please do n't try // to mix or tint a stain in a bunch of old screw caps from cans and bottles . This is such a messy way to five . Do it right . Go to an art supply store and get what they call a divided pallet ? like the top of a tin water color box only with more separation or little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finishes For beauty and protection some easy ways and harder ones that are harder . Well , I suppose the first question you have is why should I complicate your life by telling you about more than one finish . Why not just tell you the best and let it go at that ? Well , the trouble is , some are easier to do than others , and the others ( that are harder to do ) are tougher than the ones that are easier to do . The easiest one , which is shellac , is fine if you are just going to look at it . While varnish , which is the hardest , will stand up to wear , pretty hot plates and even alcohol ? as in spilled booze or perfume . And in between these you have lacquer , which is a special case for several reasons , and a compromise between lacquer and varnish that modern furniture manufacturers have settled for . You may , too . I often do . But anyway , just so you get the whole picture let 's take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at some opaque finishes . // SHELLAC We 'll start out with shellac because it alone goes back a few hundred years , being the resin extruded from a tree in India when attacked , as I assume is common-place , by some bug or other . This comes orange or bleached relatively clear ( when it is ridiculously called " white , " this being especially stupid as there is also a shellac with a lot of white pigment in it used as a primer , or first coat , in interior house painting , because it seals knots in wood that would bleed into regular paint ) . Orange or clear shellac dissolves in and is thinned by ? or even easily washed off with ? denatured alcohol . It dries fast . You can get it from shiny to any degree of dullness by rubbing it with from fine to pretty rough pads of steel wool . Grades " 0000 " ( very fine ) to " o " ( pretty rough ) . Or you can easily raise its shine to a mir ror gloss by rubbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though linseed oil is traditional ) before it is completely dry . In fact when it has just become dry enough to touch lightly . This is the historic " French polish . " ( This resul can also be achieved by rubbing liquid shellac onto a piece of wood with a pad soaked in oil ? though the wood should first be primed with an initial brushed on coat of shellac . This way the glossy finish can be built up indefinitely . ) So then why has shellac fallen out of use ? For lots o reasons . In a dry atmosphere it cracks . In a damp one i // gets cloudy . Water on it turns it white in a few hours , and a strong martini will actually dissolve it so that a rag will wipe it off when you are cleaning up after all the drunks have gone home . But it is still awfully easy to use because it sets up so fast ? in a few minutes . And this means that if you have made any mistakes , you can wipe it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alcohol and start all over again . Lacquer is where modern chemistry has come from shellac to answer the needs of all kinds of finishers from factories to museums . Starting out as a kind of liquid celluloid in the early 19oo 's , it has now been per-fected in many a marvelous breed for every purpose . Different degree of dullness can be built into it . It can he made alcohol proof and wo n't blush , cloud , white spot or crack . It can be made with oils in it so that you can pad it on over a scuffed old finish to instantly resur-face it . Or it can be combined with an amalgamator that makes it possible to brush it over an old cracked shellac finish ( or an early bad lacquer one ) to restore perfectly . BRUSHING LACQUER This kind of lacquer is relatively slow drying ? about fifteen minutes ? has excellent self-leveling qualities and goes on a lot thicker than shellac . As such , it is useful for fine touch-up work with a small camel 's hair brush such // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will use it on almost every material discussed in this wh0000le book . And naturally brushing lacquer can be used on larger surfaces such as chests and table tops , but it is n't really good for this because brushing lacquer tends to pick up any stain in the wood which can result in light patches and streaks of the stain in the lacquer . The alternatives , of course , are spraying the lacquer on or brushing on varnish , which we will now go into . . SPRAYING LACQUER The only point in using a spraying lacquer , which dries on the surface in seconds , is speed of production . You can not only spray a piece in a fifth of the time it takes to brush coat it , but also your drying time is virtually eliminated . Five or ten minutes drying time is all you need between coats and fifteen minutes for your last coat . And between coats it rubs down with " 000 " or " 0000 " steel wool beautifully and also a lot faster than you can rub a varnish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine and have a place to use it and then learn how to use a spray gun . So the only time an antiques restorer would use one is if he was running a full time refinishing shop . In such an event , instructions for use and cleaning come with the set-up . But in case you have one without instructions , // the only trick involved is that you spray in cross strokes , starting near you and moving away so that over-spray does n't settle on areas already sprayed . And by spraying in " strokes " I mean that you pull the trigger to start your cross-spraying movement and take it off the trigger at the end of each stroke . For touch-up spraying you can , of course , use an air brush . And these are becoming very popular since you no longer need a compressor . They can now be operated by tanks of air that will spray a pint of fluid ? which is an hour 's worth of touching up ? for around two dollars . This concept of selling canned air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furniture restorers : a portable lacquer finish sprayer with enough power to really work .

Very easy to keep clean , too . See illustration for more details . PADDING LACQUER This lacquer is manufactured only by companies sup-plying professional refinishers . ( See catalogue descrip-tions in back of book . ) They are all secret and probably 4 ? THE FUN OF REFINISHING FURNITURE Each pressure tank will spray four jars of liquid thinned to the same consistency you would use with a regular compressor-run spray gun . The electric ones look good , but their vibrator mechanisms will only drive water-thin liquids .

Tell them I sent you . // patented formulas , but the result is a lacquer that you wipe on in a continuous motion with a pad of lint-free cloth ( about ten layers thick and made from an old sheet or pillow case ) . This sets as you wipe it on with the same pressure you would use to polish wax , so the pad must always be lifted off the surface in motion or it will stick to the surface . It is not a hard trick to learn , and you just keep applying a little more lacquer to the cloth to gradually build up as thick a finish as you need . This lacquer is very thin , so it is not used to start a finish . The wood must first have at least one sealer coat of shellac ; lacquer or varnish already on it . What it is re-ally incredibly good for is putting a new top surface on old worn and scuffed finishes because it squeegies into the surface roughness and produces an absolutely per-fect glossy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in about fifteen minutes . Then after another fifteen min-utes of drying time , this surface can be " cut " down to the degree of dullness you want by using " 000 " steel wool in long grain-following strokes . Finally a wax or oil-base polish is applied . This is the way a professional seems to be able to " refinish " a whole bedroom set in three hours . Naturally the surface to which this is done must be very clean , and it takes three steps to clean an old finish : First : Rub bard with a wet wasbrag to remove any water-soluble dirt . // Second : Rub hard with a rag wet with mineral spirits to remove any fat , ( luck grease or traces of wax . Third : Rub hard in grain-following strokes with " 000 " grade steel wool . Fourth : Dust the surface a lot with a dry brush and a flannel ( Both ( alternately three or four times ) .

Not to mention Rome and Paris wberc ' 411 have also traveled at great ex-pense to make sure you get the absolutely right dope in this book . AMALGAMATOR This amounts to lacquer thinner with some secret ingredients in to make it less volatile . As a result it can be brushed on an alligatored or very cracked old shellac or lacquer finish , and after a few minutes of letting it soak into the old finish , it can be re-brushed into a just- , like new finish . ( Pre-cleaning as for padding lacquer is , of course , also necessary for this . ) The secret ingredients in this stuff are supposed to keep such rebrushed finishes from cracking again , but in // That 's 000 grade ( fairly fine ) steel wool on the left and fine garnet paper wrapped around a block of wood to keep it flat on the right .

Sandpaper is for smoothing wood ? not flnishes ! So remember that , or you 'll be sorry . // One of the niftier secrets of refinishing is that badly dried out old shellac finishes ? and even ones that have turned white from exposure to damp air ? can be made to look like new by brushing them with denatured alcohol ( shellac solvent ) or lacquer thinner . The finish simply re-dissolves in its solvent , and you just brush it smooth and let it dry . Then you buff it with steel wool just as you would a new finish and put a wax or polish on it . // case you have any doubts , a thin top coat of varnish will certainly make it stable . This process is really only applicable to museum pieces in which you want to preserve the original stain tinder the finish that would be disturbed by removing the finish . Also the color of the old finish . But I just thought you would like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even those at your local paint store ? are a triumph of the chemical industry and in the last couple of decades have gotten as close to perfect as a product can get . The only thing you have to watch out for are the so-called " spar " varnishes because they are designed to dry on the surface but stay pliable underneath . This is fine for the masts of sailboats out in the extremes of weather all year . But this also makes it almost impossible to dull them with steel wool without the surface breaking and your steel wool getting caught in the gummy under part of the finish . There are two troubles that people have with var-nishing , but the cures for them are very simple . The first is " fish-eyes , " or open spaces that develop after you have finished applying a coat . This is because the surface was n't cleaned and steelwooled before you started as fish-eyes are caused by non-adherence due to traces of wax or oil on the surface . The second is dust specks , and what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not going out of the air , and it is not because you did n't dust the surface well enough . They are going out of the brush if you have // used it before . And I do n't care how well you think you cleaned it if you then let it dry out . So the solution of this problem is either to use a cheap new brush for every job , or to store your brush between uses of it by banging it in its own private can of mineral spirits , the whole thing covered with a piece of alumi-num foil and stored in its own private little cupboard . And to keep your varnish clean , never dip your brush directly into the can , but pour some varnish out into a soup bowl , and dip your brush into that . You can then apply the varnish as carefully as you want to , but I never have since I saw a couple of perpet-ually soused painters applying varnish to the transom of a yacht in a boatyard out in Greenport , Long Island one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strokes as if they were trying to beat up the wood . When the whole surface had been covered this way ? and fast , so they would have an extra five minutes to sit under the boat and have another drink before the foreman came by again ? they just tipped it off , and it dried perfectly . Their point in the bard brushing was to get a thin coat to prevent sagging on the vertical surface and to prevent " skips " ( small uncovered areas ) . So ever since I 've been varnishing the same way . And since I use small cans of fresh varnish and a cheap new brush for each job , varnishing is easy . As a matter of taste you can , if you want , thin your varnish slightly for easier brushing . You need only about a tablespoonfull of mineral spirits to a cup . // Every time I give a lecture some poor soul in the audience asks me how I get rid of the " invisible " dust in the air that causes " specs " in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't any such dust . If you ca n't see it it is n't there . And if it was heavy enough to fall on your table top , it would have fallen to the floor before you started . Node , the trouble is he 's got a dirty brush , even though he 'll never believe me. // Regular furniture stains are clear , like wines or colored glass . That is because they are dyes , with no pigment in them . But in every paint store you can buy tubes of heavily pigmented stains used for coloring paint that are generically called " colors ground in oil . " And these are opaque enough that by wiping or smudging them on a surface you can conceal f laws in the wood or even make a poplar table look like a cherry one . By mixing the four colors above you can get any of the colors antique wood normally comes in . For some cherry tones you might want a little orange , too . // Lacquers , being as good as they are these days , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he needs a top surface that will be subject to a lot of abuse , because while modern lacquers may be very good , modern varnishes are fantastic in resisting even such horrors as spilled perfume on a lady 's dresser , pure straight gin soaking all night on a cocktail table and a flower pot with a hole in its bottom standing for a week with water seeping down out of it . And even in such cases the common practice is to build up your finish of lacquer first , and then just one thin coat of varnish to top it off , because it is the nature of the varnish , not its thickness that does the job , and additional coats are a waste of time . Patina is one of those words that is used a lot by smarter-than-thou know-it-alls who do n't know what they are talking about . They tell you in their invariably smug manner that a true patina can only be obtained by aging or use of years of hand polishing .

When you finally wax the piece THE FUN OF REFINISHING FURNITURE You want an alcohol-proof table top ? Just lay one thin coat of varnish over the present finish . And the secret to a trouble-free job is that you buy a cheap new brush and a small fresh can of varnish for every job . And then you add 5% to l o% mineral spirits ( paint thinner ) to the varnish to make it spread nice and thin . You do that in the bowl . And be sure you get a varnish specifically recommended for furniture on the label . Avoid " spar " varnish as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // sparingly . An oil-base polish would make your patina less visible . A second kind of patina is the kind that occurs on the surface of unfinished wood that has been sitting around in the air for a hundred or more years . Through the effect of alternately damp and dry days and seasons the fibres on the surface of the wood become loosened to form a microscopic fuzz on the surface of the wood . Then someone comes along and waxes or shellacs the surface ( you see this most often in primitive or countrybuilt chairs ) , and although matted down now the fibres still impart a vague obscurity to the surface of the wood . The duplication of this look is also no problem for your restorer who wants to duplicate this look on , say , the leg of an Early American Windsor chair on which he has just replaced a leg . The new raw leg is simply bathed in a lye solution ( a full can of crystals sprinkled gradually into a quart of water ) . This will loosen the fibres on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brown . After rinsing the leg in cold water , this brown stain disappears immediately when the leg is soaked with Clorox . Then rinse well in hot water , dry thoroughly and wax or finish , I have a couple of pieces in my living room to which just for the fun of it I have done this . Both are reproductions made around 1930 , but I now pass them off as " oh , around two hundred years old . " So far only one person has laughed at me out of over a hundred I 've // shown the pieces to . And he is one of those honest old Yankees that was doing the same thing before I was born . And at that , what he caught me on was a design detail that was wrong , which I could have corrected in the beginning if I had understood it . ANTIQUED OPAQUE The idea of applying a transparent glaze onto a colored surface goes back as far as Ancient Greece in our western line of civilization ? as well as from the beginnings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice is to accentuate or give more depth to carved or irregular surfaces . And then it ha ; , been used secondarily to make things look older by simulating the grime and dirt that collect in the crevices of old and well used pieces . Thus we have the common use of the word " antiqued " when what we really mean is glazed . All kinds of materials can be used as a base coat and a glaze and they can both be many colors for a wide variety of effects . The commonest example in our world of antiques is the " antique white " French chair of the Louis ' and even earlier Italian furniture . After all , if the French could steal their cuisine from northern Italy , why not ( heir furniture , too ? In a classic ancient piece the whole chair would be smothered by rubbing plaster into the surface of the wood . Then it was all gold leafed and burnished . Over // this would be applied a white shellac of lacquer , and finally the glaze would be brushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And then a little more hard rubbing on the wear points would allow the gold to peep through . Such an effect has been mass-produced for years with the addition of fine spatterings of black paint as a sort of stylized worm-hole and a random chipping of white lacquer , both of which practices come under the term distressing . As such finishes are supposed to have more charm the more beat-up they look , the only restoration that would be appropriate would be touching them up with lacquer and glaze . Or with white shellac sticks and glaze . CHINESE LACQUER Mostly found on boxes and trays , but sometimes on furniture , the originals were brought back from the Orient by sailing ships as soon as the British Empire began trading around the world . The base material is now sold as Japan Colors , which is a heavily pigmented lacquer " paint . " The finish now , as then , is applied by brushing on a number of coats and sanding each smooth with very fine garnet paper . The final glossy effect is achieved by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear lacquer over that if desired . The old term for this // was " French polishing . " Now we call it " padding " as in the entry above on PADDING LACQUER . MILK PAINT Unlike the preceding four novelty finishes which do not inherently relate to wood , milk paint was almost always used on it . And with obscure exceptions , milk paint is found almost exclusively on primitive Early American furniture . Because it was the only paint they had to cover up what they considered to be plain ordinary pine . The term milk paint is a half misnomer , because it was made by mixing milk with buckets of blood collected at slaughtering time , offering a range ( if colors from pale pink to dark red , depending on the proportions used . But also strong colored clays were locally mixed with milk , and to a limited extent ( because of its cost ) yellow and blue pigments imported from England . This paint was used on virtually all Windsor chairs as again the wood just was n't considered to be worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walnut . So even today the scraped-down Windsor chair is not for you purists , even traces of the original paint left on the scraped-down ones are considered a plus value . On blanket chests this paint was also given a crude but very attractive false graining by swirling around some darker colored paint on the base surface before it // was dry . Often with a date in the middle . And this effect can easily be reproduced even by your tyro forger . It can be done with ordinary oil-base paints , your flat latex paints or you can even make up some milk paint using powdered milk and powdered dry color . Then , of course , you will want to batter the piece around with a chain and then give it a couple of coats of dirty shellac . 6 Patching &; Concealing The deceptive arts of visual ohs f ucation and illusion . If all the tricks in an antique restorer 's bag , , none is ore important than the combined use of shellac or lacuer sticks and touch-up powders . For not only do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ood , but also on stone , ceramics , metal , glass ? anying rigid . But their use is nowhere near as widespread as it ould be because people are afraid of them . They think at they are too hard to use , and this belief is en ? uraged by professional restorers , who are an ancient aft guild type . To scare people off they even go so far s to call the sticks " burn-in " sticks and the process of sing them " burning-in . " And the whole thing is n't anylung like that . There is no burning , with all its dangers connotations , at all . The sticks are melted at a very *w , safe heat such a low heat in fact that they will not inrt any finish at their hottest . // P do n't really believe that you could learn to use patching or " burn-in " sticks from this , but it does give you an idea of what you are up against . I do n't think anybody could learn it without watching it be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to watch him once for a half an hour . The rest is practice on your own . You find such people to watch in the back rooms of furniture stores , buzy as bees . 6o THE FUN OF REFINISHING FURNITURE Of course the origin of this is that the sticks used to be melted and applied with a knife blade that was heated over an open flame ? usually that of an alcohol lamp . But even this is now obsolete , and everybody except a few incurable old-timers uses an electric ironing tool made to reach and then maintain just the right heat . The wonderful part of these sticks is that they come in over a hundred colors , solid and transparent ? and about fifteen shades of white ? and when melted these can even be mixed to get exact matches . And , of course , the material is always the same color whether solid or melted . The process is quite simple . For purposes of tration , let us say that the problem is a cigarette burn on a mummy 's toe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make it the edge of the top of a Louis XIV side table . First you scrape the charred wood out with the blade of a sharp penknife , getting all the black away from the edges , but leaving perhaps some in the center of the bottom of the crater you are digging . If the wood in your hole shows up a lot lighter than the rest of the table top you can stain it to a pretty close match with a quick drying liquid stain . Or you can smudge in some touch-up powder . ( Which we will get to in the next section . ) Now you drip into the hole a mixture of your sticks that as a beginner you will have melted together in a teaspoon held over an alcohol lamp . Later on you can do // this right on your iron . With the iron you now press this glob smooth with the surface of the table top and finally sand off any extra with some very fine garnet paper wrapped around a perfectly flat block of hard felt . With padding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceal any signs of your patch by smudging tiny bits of touch-up powder over them , polish them in with some more padding lacquer , and then go over the whole top with padding lacquer so it will all have the same degree of shine to it . Which you can then dull with steel wool if desired . Simple , is n't it ? Now about those touch-up powders I just mentioned . TOUCH-UP STAINS Like the shellac sticks these powder stains come in a wide range of colors . They also have the fine quality of not changing color or shade whether wet or dry or mixed into padding lacquer ? or any lacquer or even shellac , for that matter . This makes them the ultimate material for the antiques restorer ? or forger , too , of course . And like the heat sticks they can also be used on many other materials besides wood . So where do you get these magic powders ? Again I must recommend Mohawk as the best source because of their giant color chart . And you can order them from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sets . 7 Repairing The hard part is to learn how to ? think about repairing . Then you 've got it licked ! Well , I do n't want to go very far with this , because there are many , many good books already available on the subject . Not to mention a steady flow of articles in the magazines . So I think I should only refer to the aspect of woodworking that specifically apply to antiques , an these you will find in the second part of this chapter that takes up specific problems commonly encountered . So in the next few pages I will limit myself to giving some reckless advice to anyone who wants to set up shop for repairing antiques as opposed to making furniture and so on from raw wood . And the difference between the two kinds of shops lies in the nature of the tools you will use more often in repairing than in building . The hand tools are about the same in both eases , ex64 THE FUN OF REFINISHING FURNITURE cept that the repairer will be using chisels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will also have much more need for a large vice that can be well padded with layers of woolen blanket or felt to hold finished pieces of wood ? like the carved leg of a Chippendale chair while you are trying to put on a new foot . Also you will run across gluing jobs that will take about a dozen various sized C-clamps with pieces of soft pine or hard felt glued to their pressure-exerting surfaces . For knocking loose jointed chairs and other things apart , you will also need a mallet whose head is made of rolled felt or leather . Or at least an ordinary hammer whose head has been softened by wrapping many lay , ers. of pieces of woolen blanket around it . And speaking of gluing , which is what ninety-five percent of all repair work on wood consists of , the ubiquitous white glues are fine for regluing fairly tight joints and for tacking small pieces onto larger pieces where there is no strain in use . But for serious gluing there is no substitute for good old Weldwood plastic resin powder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And if you mix it with sawdust to make a paste in stuffing loose joints you will never go wrong , because it hardens without shrinking like cast iron . On the negative side forget all about the syrupy brown glues . One of these has a famous name and you see it everywhere , but there ought to be a law against selling it . Which also goes for the brown flake glues that // Never let it be said that I criticized the modern white glues that are on the market under a hundred trade names these days . But they can soften under sustained moist conditions . Even so , they are fine for tight fitting Points where moisture will never get . But Weldwood not only penetrates wood fibres , but turns into some kind of rock . The only reason for not using it all the time is that you have to mix up little batches each time by adding water to the powder . // you have to heat up in a pot , fish glue , hide glue , etc. and the brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glues is that they are not waterproof or even slightly resistant to moisture after they have dried . Thus moist weather will loosen them , and they account for all the antique tables , chairs , chests and everything else that ever fell apart . Personally , I love gluing things together . That 's how I got in trouble with Steve Cook 's eleven-year-old daughter . The Cooks live right down the street from us , so one afternoon when I found a chair in their house that really fascinated me with its ricketiness , I just walked out with it when they were n't looking and brought it back a few days later solid as a rock with Weldwood . So that evening Steven and Gertie ( that 's his wife ) were wondering aloud at the dinner table what they could do for me to pay back the favor . That 's when their eleven-year-old daughter piped up with , " Well , if he gets such a kick out of gluing old chairs , why not just give him another one to glue ! " ( Hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really happen . ) And finally , another negative word about these contact glues that are like a thick , tan rubber cement , which have been especially pushed for attaching veneers . They seemed great when they first came out , but the passage of time has revealed that in some cases for some unknown reason they begin to loosen . // Of course , the best way to reattach or replace a piece of leg is with a dowel and Weldwood . No iron screws or straps will ever work . They will always loosen , but a glued dowel wo n't . What the above drawing does n't explain is how you hold your extension on the old leg while you drill your hole through it . Well , the answer is that you flattened both joint surfaces and glued your extension " foot " on to the leg the day before . Just so it would stay in place for the drilling operation . But it is the dowel glued in that really does the job . // PIPE CLAMPS . The head and foot fit onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can clamp wide or long things . Shown here is just a table leaf , but you can even use them to hold a seven-foot long sideboard together while your glue dries in its joints . The two pieces of the clamp come off the pipe easily , so you usually just leave them on a five foot length of pipe , keeping shorter and longer lengths of pipe in reserve . The pads are a must , as these clamps exert a tremendous pressure . Of at least three-quarter inch pine , the pads should extend three inches on each side of the clamp . // In power tools the big difference is that the repairer will prefer a small band saw to a table saw . This is obvi-ously because in antiques you have a lot more curved lines than straight ones . But , of course , it 's still nice to have both . And you 'll be a lot happier if you have two quarter-inch drills , one with a bit in it for sinking dowels and the other with a disc sander on it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have them both lying around ready for use . Incidentally , in repairing antiques you will be using a lot more dowels than screws . They are easiest to sink tightly and are more permanent because they have the same coefficient of expansion as the wood around them . Also your glue can bond into them as it ca n't screws . In fact the only use for screws in any cabinet work is to hold two flat pieces tightly glued together while the glue dries . And as far as the obscenity of screwing iron angles and straps onto furniture goes , I ca n't even think about that without getting nauseous . It is n't enough that they look terrible , but they do n't work . Again the problem is the different coefficient of expansion . Your wood may be expanding in the heat of summer and shrinking in win-ter only a minute amount , but that damn iron is shrink-ing and expanding a lot less ? with the result that any such repair is bound to tear itself apart in time . // BASIC METHOD OF PATCHING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of a blanket chest with one leg smashed off and lost . First you establish a straight flat edge on the leg by running it through a table saw . ( Having taken the end off the chest first , of course . ) Then you rough out a new leg a little oversize and give it a matching straight flat edge on the saw . This gives you a joint that will stay glued . In some cases you may want to add a V4 " dowel as shown or glue a reinforcing strip inside the leg . Near the edge so your " C " clamps can reach it . No screws or nails , please . // " C " CLAMP . This could be an illustration of how two of these would be used to reinforce that new foot on that blanket chest in another illustration somewhere around here . But it is n't , because there is no second piece of wood being held to the one piece in the drawing . Which makes this a pretty silly drawing , except to show what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clamping faces have to be padded so they do n't chew into the wood being clamped . ( Well , if you must know , the truth is that by the time it came to write this caption it was too late to correct this stupid drawing ! ) // BASIC METHOD OF PATCHING LEG . As with board , you first get yourself two flat surfaces . Then you drill into both of them to receive a short piece of dowel . By making your added piece oversize as shown above you do n't have to worry about not having your dowel holes exactly matching . After the joint is dry , you simply trim off the excess wood on the new piece . // It is really a shame that they still allow the old hide and hoof glues to be sold .

My Uncle Jake used to be able to do it , but time never meant anything to him anyway . So I was delighted when I got a job in a furniture action factory and one of the old timers there showed me you could get just as fine an edge on a motor driven grindstone if you were careful not to let the steel get too hot as this burns the fine edge right off . Just do n't press very hard and keep cooling the blade in water or oil . And an even more practical way to keep a chisel blade sharp is by pulling it across a file . This is also how you resharpen a circular saw three or four times before it needs a professional job because you eventually foul up the " set , " which is the alternate slanting of the teeth to left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your expectation of how ong it will take by about ten . The first thing about carving is that it is only sensib ith certain " good-carving " woods . White pine soup ( , cod because it is so soft . But it is so weak that it w hip out . That is to say , pieces will break off accidental t the slightest wrong pressure . Also a blade tends to slip in it and not cut in exactly as directed . The ideal wood for carving is Honduras mahogany and second best are the heavier , denser African and the l imitation mahoganies . A little harder but wit 1st as much response to the blade is American cherry when come the walnuts because they have a slight tendency to splinter as you cut them . Not much , but a little . The way you use the blade ? like good driving ? is defensive . Your objective is to cut away slices and wedge of wood without splintering it or busting out pieces you // do n't want to . And attacked brutally enough even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break . Of course , carving tools are useful , or they would n't exist . But I 've never seen a job of carving that could n't , with a little bit of patience , be done with the small blade of a very sharp penknife . Or do I mean the very sharp blade of a small penknife ? And that 's a good way to sta to get the feel of carving . Then real carving tools will b a delight because you can work about five times faster . About that sharp blade . This is where it is all at . An so some people resort to Exacto knives , but the troubl with them is that you ca n't hold them close enough t the point as you can with a penknife , a carving tool or thin chisel ( which is in essence a straight-blade carvin tool ) . The point being that you get to push the blad away from you . So sharpening is the problem , and the first point i that some steels sharpen better than others , and basic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . do n't know why , but it just does n't sharpen well . As t sharpening a cutting edge , you can use a file , a stone revolving stone , and you can find that in the section o Repairs . I was going to start out by saying that about the on thing you ca n't do with wood is cast it . But then remembered that you can . The medallions and bas-reli decorations you see on cabinet doors and panels is wood pulp east in molds . And , of course , you can do th // same thing for some repairs by mixing sawdust with glue and modeling it with a greasy blade or pressing it with wax paper . When this is fine-sanded after drying , this will take stain . Use a white glue . Weldwood is too hard to take any stain . Then with touch-up powders you can make the surface indistinguishable from the real thing . // ARMOIRES This is the French word for what the English call a clothes press and Americans are at a loss to call anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for hanging up your clothes . But there is a very good reason for using the French word , and that is that the ones you find in the United States are coming down ( by the truck-load ) from Canada 's French speaking ( and acting ) province of Quebec . They are about five to six feet tall and have two full length doors on the top . Some are empty inside , others have had shelves put in . Structurally they are of floating panel construction . That is to say that the sides and doors are made of wide boards fitted into slotted frames . And as they are of " primitive " construction this is plainly obvious . Usually they were painted ? originally ? lovely pale blues and yellows with milk-base paint . Whenever found with such original paint it should be preserved at all costs , and badly worn or scuffed areas should be touched up a matching color . This can be done with any flat water paint such as the poster paints that come in jars or flat interior wall paints that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide variety of tinting colors which you can add to white to get any color and shade you want . Should you ever want to remove any of the original // paint ? say , because there is n't enough left to be worth saving ? straight ammonia will do it best . Should the ammonia darken the wood , it can be returned to its nat ural color ( after the ammonia has dried thoroughly ) by flushing it with Clorox . Sophisticated French Canadians value these pieces es pecially as their panels have been carved to show a raised diamond shape in each panel . Then they simply scrape the wood with pieces of broken glass and wax it well . They just do n't seem to care about the original part the way us American connoisseurs do . If you want to buy a couple of thousand of these , I suggest you go to the vast antique storage barns of Rene Beaudoin in the small town of Defoy in the Province of Quebec . This town lies about a half mile south of the super highway that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is about three-fifths of the way toward Quebec , but you will have to get a Canadian road map to find it , as it is not shown on U.S. maps that show that southern part of Canada . Of course , I 'm pretty snobby about preserving old original paint , but I do n't suppose anyone will shoot if you stain and varnish one of these . Or even paint it and decorate it peasant style . In fact , I saw one in Boston not long ago that had been painted pure vermillion , stripped with gold and then wiped with a dark brown an tique glaze . Which is about as far as you can go , but I 'll // have to admit that it was stunning if you go in for that sort of dramatic effect . BEDS The characteristic trouble with old beds is that the people who made them did n't have sense enough to make them in sizes that fit modern springs ? inner or otherwise . The big problem , of course is that they are all too short , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is shown in our accompanying illustration ? as well as how headboards are made to fit in a slightly wider frame . Since these stretchers are usually made of a very hard and well-seasoned wood , this is not a job for an amateur carpenter , so after taking your measurements you are going to have to take your stretchers to someone who has some heavy-duty saws and experience in using them . You need straight cuts so the glue can bind the pieces together under the pressure of clamps . Weldwood , of course , is an excellent glue to use for this . Another effective method would be to drill holes and fit them with steel bolts , although it is a lot more trouble and not really necessary . Naturally your " new wood " patching piece is made a little oversize so you can trim it down and then stain to match .

And who ever heard of anybody breaking the leg off a bed ? BELLOWS When one of the wooden pieces of a bellows has been broken we have a more interesting problem than is obvious at first glance . The broken off piece is almost certainly there , because it is attached to the leather . The problem comes when you try to clamp it in position while your glue dries .

And your diagonally placed clamps will slip off and/or cause the glued-on piece to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to such a problem on any flat piece of wood is to place it on a wide board or rough table top and exert the clamping pressure between nails driven into the table .

This technique naturally applies to many other survey pieces of wood such as chair backs where it may even be // This is n't all floating in space . The bellows is laid on a board , the nails are driven into the board around it , then the wood blocks and wedges are pushed in to exert pressure while the glue hardens in the split . It is really amazing how the curviest things can be repaired if you have the patience to figure out or even custom-build a jig to hold them together in .

What they ca n't give you as scrap they 'll sell you or tell you where to get it . The first step is to clean off the edges of the wooden pieces . If the old leather can be taken off reasonably in-tact , you then use this as a pattern for your new piece . If not , use some old sheeting to establish a pattern by cut-ting a piece to approximate size and attaching it tempo-rarily to the wooden pieces with rubber cement .

And the tacks to use are the same kind upholsterers use , which are availa-ble in really big hardware stores , and certainly from up-holsterers . The trick in the actual process is not to try to glue the whole thing first , but to position the leather with a tack about every six inches . Then you glue and tack about four inches along at a time . // BLANKET CHESTS Whether of the long , low variety or the " standup " kind with one or more drawers ( real or fake ) , these invariably come in the rough with one or both hinges of the lift-top broken off and the wood under the hinges split from previous repairs attempted by some Visigoth using a sledge hammer or a pickaxe . ra If the strap hinges need to be replaced , reproductions can be had from Old Guilford Forge , Guilford , Connecticut , ground to matching shape and antiqued .

The real trouble was that over the years the board the top was made of has shrunk and is now anywhere from a quarter of an inch to an inch narrower . And when the front lip of the top is pushed down over the front of the chest , it has pulled on the screws holding the bottom half of the hinge to the back of the chest . Obviously an adjustment is necessary . The hard way is to bend the lower half of your hinge so that the joint exHOW // The tops of old pine blanket chests usually contract over the years causing them not to close properly and/or tear their hinges off .

See illustration . Another way is to reset the screws that attach the top half of the hinge to the top of the chest . Though some purists will object to this on the grounds that the move will show due to the exposed screw hole and the paleness of the wood under the hinge that is now exposed . In either case a strip of wood may be added to the back edge of the top to restore it to its original width . Properly stained and distressed , this will never be noticed . Especially if the joint is camouflaged with touch-up powders . Another alternative is to pry the front lip of the top off , and insert your widening strip between the lip and the front edge of the top . BENTWOOD This term usually refers to the furniture of the Victorian era that is now being exactly reproduced in Spain and shipped to the United States in great quantities . The problem with it is , of course , that when it breaks it splits and the wood springs apart so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glue sets when you try to repair it . The solution to this problem is to have the patience to fashion hollowed-out blocks of wood to be used inside of your clamps . And you can also give the hollows in these blocks a non-slip surface by coating them with contact cement and letting it dry well . It is // simply a matter of fooling around until you have good control of your clamping operation . ( See also Windsor Chairs . ) BOWLS The obvious way to refinish a wooden bowl ? if you want to use it to mix salads ? is to soak it with olive oil . The trouble with this , as with so many obvious things , is that it 's wrong . The bowl may look all right , but you have to spend the rest of your life eating salads flavored with rancid olive oil . A far better finish for a bowl that is to be used is a penetrating wood sealer .

Cracks are harder . Gluing wo n't work , because after a few months or a year a new crack will begin to appear just to one side or the other of your glued joint . But a glued quarter-inch dowel will work on one of the long bowls with handles on the ends . See illustration . In the really hard case of the round bowl the only thing that will work is a butterfly patch , and this has the great advantage of looking antique itself as you often find old bowls mended this very way long ago .

All this is not as hard as it sounds , because your " butterfly " does not have to be exactly symmetrical , because of our method of inserting it , which starts with our cutting its outline onto the outside surface of the bowl . ( Which incidentally remains clamped throughout this whole operation . ) Now , hollow out one side of the butterfly so that it fits snugly against the bowl , and glue it onto the outside of the bowl where the patch will be . This gluing is , of course , only temporary to keep the butterfly in place while you cut around its edges to start the hole that will receive it .

The incision you make in the bowl around your butterfly should be made with a thin blade such as an Exacto knife , a single-edged razor blade or a very sharp penknife blade , and need only go about an eighth inch deep ? but not less . Now carefully pry loose your butterfly , and continue carving out the hole in your bowl that is going to receive it .

Incidentally , partial or complete penetration of the butterfly patch through to the inside of the bowl is perfectly acceptable . You just need a fat enough butterfly , HOW TO DO IT FROM A TO Z The almost universal problem with hinges attaching box tops or lids is the splitting of the wood under the screws . Or around them .

Well , it all depends on what kind of a box you 're talking about , does n't it ? The only problem that I can think of that a box has that is inherent in its being a box is that the hinges have pulled out . And do n't they always ? So why do n't you just check back to the entry on Blanket Chests for the principles involved ? That leaves you only with the problem of finding small hinges , for which see the Appendix in the back of the book . BRASSES See accompanying illustration . BREAD BOARDS ( and Breadboard Table Tops ) Splitting is the problem here , because the main board shrinks laterally , and the end pieces do n't shrink longitu-dinally . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to be of interest to us antique lovers such shrink-ing is completed . So all you have to do is pry the ends off , pull out the old nails , clamp the split center board tight and nail your end-pieces back . If you are reproducing a bread board top and using // ioz THE FUN OF REFINISHING FURNITURE comparatively new wood , you might consider the trick Francis Hagerty has figured out for his reproductions . The end-pieces are only fastened in the middle , and no glue is used . This way the center board is free to eontract or shrink without splitting . BUCKETS What the old wooden bucket that has fallen apa needs is a good drink of water . You assemble the rattling pieces and hold them in place with masking tape while the whole thing is immersed in water for a week ? or as long as necessary for the wood to swell up really tight .

The reasons being that the // The way to prevent wooden panels from cracking is to let them float free to expand or contract . Mostly contract ? from drying out , of course .

Consisting of iron frames with wooden seats and backs , these seats , after being detached from their bub gies , are too low to sit on comfortably , and the most attractive and steadiest way to raise them is to mount them on a box built to size . This gives you a sort of magazine shelf under the seat . Or you can put a removable lid on your box for a nice shallow storage space to hide your good bottles of whiskey . Carriage striping will doll these things up a bit , as will a red velvet cushion . Then your house will look just like a sham English pub on Route 66 . CANE As any fool can plainly tell you , once caning has been damaged in any way the only solution is to replace the whole panel or section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now that any fool is plainly wrong . And has been ever since the white glues ( such as the widely distributed Elmer 's ) have been on the market . Because when cane is soaked in and coated with this kind of glue , the cane can be restored to ninety-five and // maybe a hundred percent of its original strength . Of course to make these repairs you need patience , two blocks of flat wood a little larger than the size of the damaged area and some sheets of waxed paper to face the blocks of wood to keep the glue from sticking to the blocks when they are pressing the cane flat from both sides . A great big C-clamp is also useful to press the blocks together while the glue is drying . But you can also use hand pressure , as the glue sets in about ten minutes and you can easily last ten minutes with your hands if you relax them for fifteen seconds every two or three minutes during that time . That is the general principle involved , and there are so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damage , I do n't think it appropriate to go into specific instructions for them all . But here are some more generalities that might help : First of all , no matter how bad the damage looks at first glance , I assure you that if you take the time to look at it and think about it , you will see that it can be repaired by breaking it down into steps , that is into three or four gluing sessions . In the first session you may want to glue together just the ends of a few broken strands to establish your restored position . This is clone by gluing the ends together while holding them in place by pinning them both to a small block of wood ( insulated from the glue by a small piece of wax paper , of course ) . lob THE FUN OF REFINISHING FURNITURE The next session you can glue together some strands running at right angles to the ones already glued . As you go along excess glue can be sliced off with a single-edged razor blade or even better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's picky-picky-picky all the way , but if you do n't like this sort of thing why do n't you take up bridge or bowling ? I suppose the most common problem with caning is a sagging bottom that has begun to give along one edge . In this case what you do is establish the seat of the chair upside down on a waterproof table top ( or one suitably covered with a plastic sheet or other waterproof covering ) . Then you soften the cane by soaking it with wet toweling placed on it . Depending on the cane you will have to keep this toweling wet for from twenty-four hours to four days . When the cane is as soft and pliable as it is going to get , you dry it and push it back into position and weight it down to dry flat . You achieve this by covering it with dry toweling and weighting that down with blocks of wood on which you stack books , gallon cans of paint or whatever . This can take an annoyingly long time , and you start out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then every four hours , then over night . But you can speed up the process by heating your toweling first on a hot radiator . You can probably get your cane dry in four hours by applying fresh hot , dry toweling every ten minutes . Or you can try // ironing it through a towel with a hand iron set for " cotton . When the cane is dry , you soak the whole seat in your white glue for fifteen minutes so it will penetrate the cane . Then you wipe it off with a clamp rag , and press it flat to dry over night between two sheets of waxed paper . You did this just to firmly establish the position of the cane . After twenty-four hours you peel the wax paper off , and trim any excess glue off with your Exacto knife . Another picky-picky job on which you should be reconciled to spending an hour and a half . But then you are ready to brush on a final coating of glue , top , and bottom , which you can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Depending on how thick your first coat was , you may want to go for the insurance by applying a second coating of glue after another forty-eight hours of drying time . And I think you should . After all , what have you got to show for your time if you waste it playing bridge or going bowling ? Now having said all that about repairs I still realize that there will undoubtedly be times when you will want to replace old caning with new . In that event , there are two companies which will supply you not only with everything you need , but also very good booklets of instructions on how to do caning from scratch . And since you are going to have to buy your cane from them anyway , there is no point in my reproducing their directions which are better than I could write anyhow . lob THE FUN OF REFINISHING FURNITURE In each case you ought to send along about fifty cen for their catalogues of supplies and direction booklets , These companies are : THE H.

CASTERS Aside from oiling the main problem with these is tha one is missing and what you need is a new matching se of four . Wise old antique dealers and junk shops savthese sets from junked pieces just for this purpose an . will sell them to you cheaply .

Porcelain ones are also available out of stocks left over from Victorian furniture factories , and you will find these advertised from time to time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with curved pieces in them present the worst problems , and the only way to repair them is with dowels , for which see illustration herewith and refer back to Woodworking in the introduction to this chapter . For all old chairs the problem is that they start falling apart because until a few decades ago nobody had invented a decent glue . The so-called hide , fish and hoof glues ? all the ones that look like a thick maple syrup ? and the ones you have to melt , just have no resistance at all to moisture in the air on dare days . So the only right way to re-glue a chair is to take it apart as much as possible by knocking it with a leather mallet or padded hammer . Then the old glue can be softened rapidly by soaking it with vinegar for about fifteen minutes . And you just scrape it off with a chisel and a penknife to get into any dowel holes . When re-gluing ( with Weldwood , of course ) be sure to make all the joints fit tightly by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit into , then cut the 1 // protruding ends off with'a razor blade for a neat job . All glue works best if it gets to dry under pressure , and this is especially true of the end of rungs fitting into chair legs . For this purpose someone has invented a strap clamp ? like a big cinch-buckle belt . Or you can use rope and twist it tight with a stick . A sort of chair tourniquet . There is a device around like a sort of glue hypodermic needle that you use to squirt glue into joints that you have drilled small holes in from the side of the leg . But these are a delusion because you have n't removed the old glue , which will crumble again in a few more years , and the new glue ca n't get at the bare wood to do its work . Often you will want to re-glue a chair with an upholstered seat without going to all the work of removing all the upholstery so you can knock the frame apart . And , strangely enough , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the edging strip and pull up the corners of the seat cover . You scrape as much old glue out of the now exposed joints as you can . Push in what new glue you can , tie or clamp and let the glue dry . This is , of course , a lousy job , but it is enough to hold your pieces of chair together rigidly while you do the real trick . And this is to drill holes across the joints and fasten them with fresh dowels ? the ends of which wherever possible will be covered when you tack your seat covering and edging back in place again . Exposed dowel ends are cut off and sanded flush . Then you stain them and conceal them with touch-up powders and spray lacquer . // Of course , you clean and re-glue the old dowels first , and let the glue set overnight . But then to get a really guaranteed job , you drill two new holes right through the front face of the chair leg , and insert two new dowels . Naturally , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front face of the leg has to be restored with some filler and touch-up powders . Well , I never promised you a rose garden . // u5ci , ow-E-R ' ' Plae-S of- pow E WEre ' 55A'R'e AND C07 O F FLIPS You can do wonders with dowel repairing on even the most complicated angles and curves . Of course you have to figure out where to put your dowels on each different piece , and the hard part is figuring ways to clamp the irregular pieces together tightly while you are drilling the dowel holes . It 's the sort of thing you have to enjoy doing , or you 'd go mad . // CHERRY TABLES ( etc . ) The repair of tables in general is taken up later in this chapter , but the Early American drop-leaf table is such a popular piece that it is somehow in a class by itself , and there are also some things to be said about cherry wood . The reason there were so many cherry tables made from colonial days almost up to the Civil War is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Honduras mahogany used in the furniture of the rich people in Philadelphia , New York and Boston . Some of it made in those cities , some imported from England . So all these early cherry tables were originally stained a dark red , as opposed to the lighter browns or natural that everyone seems to prefer today . And , so stained , you have to cross the room and look at the figure in the wood closely to tell the difference . About every house in the country must have had one of these tables until the coming of the Victorian era . And then these gems were considered to be out of style . So they were replaced by golden oak monstrosities and demoted to the kitchen or cooking shed or even the cel-lar workshop . That is why they are often found covered with black water marks , dirty oil soaked into them , and marked with circular indentations on the edges of their top from // meat grinders and other contraptions having been screwed onto them . And with tops and leaves warped . Happily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . WITHOUT sanding and thus losing the character of the worn and used surface unless absolutely necessary ! Sanding any antique wood unless totally necessary is the mark of the Visigoth and other direct descendants from cretin man . Some of the cures for these special ills of cherry tables are as follows : The warps come out beautifully with cherry by putting the concave side down on a flat grassy lawn on a sunny summer day for an hour , more or less . ( I speak as a New Englander . In autumn or spring it just takes longer , and in Southern California or Florida winter is just as good . ) But this will take a few trys on a few clays clue to a slight tendency for a flattened leaf to regress to its warp over night in your house . Or you often over-correct a warp and have to briefly reverse the process a little . That 's not as hard as it sounds , because it is great fun , and everybody in your neighborhood will be fascinated and come over to ask you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from water ? a blemish to which cherry is outstandingly susceptible ? come out like magic when you soak them ( after scrubbing off any surface grease with soap and water or finish remnants with paint remover ) with a saturate solution of oxalic acid crystals in water or denatured alcohol . The basic proceHOW // You really should put off taking warps out of table tops and leaves until a good hot sunny August day because the trick works so much faster with a really broiling sun . With pine in an hour or two , with the dense wood in maybe only one full day . But I have seen wood that took three days to straighten out even in a good hot sun . In any event , you will want to keep good old wet mother earth good and wet by lifting up your table leaf , etc. , every hour or so and pouring a pail of water on it . Also you can put rocks on top , or on the high corners in case of a twisted warp . // dure is to fill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in about a quarter of a pound box of oxalic acid crystals or until no more crystals dissolve on shaking . ( This stuff will sting in scratches but otherwise not hurt your bare fingers . In this case " acid " means only chemically opposite of " alkali , " like vinegar is . ) The wood should be good and dry , of course , so it will suck in the liquid . Works fast . In thirty-nine seconds to five minutes . Then flush off with clear water , wipe dry , and neutralize any traces of oxalic in the wood with a bath of pure vinegar . Let the vinegar soak for five minutes , then give the wood a final rinse with water ? like from a garden hose . You get oxalic acid crystals at any good paint store . If some Victorian ancestor has cleaned his carburetor on the top of your particular table , you can draw up some of the oil with a hot iron and blotting paper ? after a good soap and water scrubbing , of course . This will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary first step . The next step , which should be obvious to the meanest intelligence , is to soak the whole top of the table and both leaves with dirty oil from your crankcase or the drum down at your gas station . In other words , you do n't remove the stain ? because you ca n't ? you match it . It 's a matter of when you ca n't beat ' cm , join ' em . Now to further equalize appearances , remove the oil with a bath of weak lye water . That 's about a half can of // lye crystals to two quarts of water . Scrub this in a lot with an old fashioned bristle scrubbing brush . In addi-tion to removing the oil , this will also turn the cherry wood a delightful brown , making it quite unnecessary to stain the wood before finishing . Now flush and wipe your lye-water solution off the wood , neutralize any lye in the surface with a bath of vinegar , flush with water and let dry . If there is a fuzz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rub it off with " co " grade steel wool , and you can now proceed with staining the wood even darker if you wish and then finishing . For those who like their cherry wood lighter than it looks after a lye bath , this lye-given brownness can easily be removed by using a liquid laundry bleach as a neu-tralizing bath instead of the vinegar . It only takes a few minutes for the bleach to work . Then flush it off with clear water . There are reasons for all this neutralizing and flushing with clear water . Any traces of lye left in the wood 's sur-face will cause gummy spots in any finish you apply over them . Traces of oxalic acid will turn pink under the finish as it dries . Traces of the laundry bleach will affect any stain you might apply . There are two schools of thought about the signs of wear and marks of abuse . Some people try to conceal them as much as possible by scratching them out , stain-ing them , filling them with patching sticks and con-cealing them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their cherry tables wear their marks like badges of honor . The second group is right , because telling stories of what has happened in the past is what antiques are all about . It is beyond being a matter of what is ugly and what is beautiful . Marks left by meat-grinders on cherry tables in 188o are history . And when you try to change history , you 're crazy . CHESTS OF DRAWERS Sometimes when I think of the sorrows and ailments that can beset a poor chest of drawers I could almost cry . Especially an Empire chest drawers , because they . were designed and made so terribly . But we take those special problems up in the Empire listing under Furniture Styles . Here we are concerned only with common ills such as sticking drawers , loose or missing knobs and pulls , rattling drawers , musty smells and ordinary falling apart . Starting with the worst first , the only right way to reglue a chest of drawers is to knock it all apart so it lies around the floor like a kit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remember which piece came from where as you will find out that in anything antique , left side pieces are rarely interchangeable with right side pieces . Nor are the different drawers ever the same size or even shape . Which brings me to an important tip that I learned // the hard way . When you re-glue any " box " that contains drawers you are in danger of finding , after everything is dry , that all your drawers are a quarter of an inch bigger than the spaces they are supposed to fit in . This is due to shrinkage of the wood and that you have taken up all the slack with your re-gluing . Also you can find that your drawers tilt imperceptibly one way and your chest imperceptibly the other . Imperceptible , that is , until you try to get the drawers back in . The answer is to be sure you have the drawers back in their proper spaces while the glue in your box joints is drying . And then make sure your drawers fit into their spaces before their glue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually have to trim them down a little . The big thing is for your box to dry straight . Sticking drawers is caused by warping of the drawer sides or some other uneven ratio of drying in all the little pieces of wood involved , and if rubbing paraffin on likely spots does n't solve the problem some trimming with a plane will have to be done . When drawers are loose , first check and if necessary refasten the guides inside the chest . More frequently , especially if the wood is pine , the bottoms of the drawer sides will have chaffed away and/or worn grooves in the pieces of wood that support them . There is nothing easy to be done about this . It is a lot of fussy work , but you are just going to have to glue thin strips of new wood to // the bottom edges of the drawers and replace the supporting pieces inside the box . But the most common complaint of all is a chest of drawers with a musty ( or worse ) smell . Washing it out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it does n't help the smell . What you have to do is seal the smell in , and there are two approaches to this . The first is to soak every square inch of surface of both the box and the drawers with " boiled " linseed oil . This is n't really boiled , but just has a japan drier added to it . ( If you try boiling your own linseed oil you are going to end up burning down your house . ) The result is a chest of drawers that smells of linseed oil . But some people think that is great . Since I do n't , I apply a good thick coat of shellac ( two parts shellac to one part denatured alcohol thinner ) to all inside surfaces . If you are troubled with worms , ticks or dry rot , you soak all surfaces ? outside as well as inside ? with a product called Cuprinol . This is a base of petroleum distillate ( like mineral spirits or turpentine ) and wo n't hurt any exterior finishes . After a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in with shellac inside . If you ca n't get Cuprinol in your local paint and hardware store , they always carry it in boatyards , for dry rot in wooden hulls . For missing brass pulls and knobs , see the catalogue section in the back of the book . Wooden knobs are usually impossible to match or even find . Ideally these can // be turned on a lathe , but who has a lathe ? The alternative is to rough out a knob on a power saw and with a disc sander , then hold it in a vice while you finish it off with hand tools : knife , chisel , wood rasp , file , penknife . The best way to do this is to shape your knob on the end of a piece of wood about eight inches long so you have something to hold onto while you work on your knob , leaving the cutting of the knob off the end of the stick for your last step . CLOCKS If you think a foolish consistency is going to stop me from telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know me very well , because inconsistencies are just about my favorite thing in the world . The main " secret " is that you use benzine , which just happens to be lighter fluid . And if you are suspicious of that , you can also get benzine at a drug store for twice the price . Obviously you soak the works if possible , but you can also flush and brush . The second " secret " is that once clean you oil it with nothing but clock oil , which you have to get from your local watchmaker or Mason &; Sullivan ( see below ) . And the really good secret is that you do n't oil the cogs of the gears ? just the bearings . And you do that with a needle stuck into the eraser on the end of a pencil // The way you whittle a new knob ? whether you speed up the job with a power sander or not  --  is work on one end of a stick so you have something to hold onto . You do the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want a dowelless knob , just cut it off the end of your stick with a saw . // so that you can get the tiniest amount of oil possible into the bearing ? the more oil the more dust to be caught in it . Now about Mason &; Sullivan . This is the mail-order branch of a great clock company , so besides selling you oil , they also carry things like brass finials , hands , all kinds of faces , foot levelers , weights and replacement movements that are spring , weight , electric and battery operated . Even a reproduction of an old moving moon face for a grandfather clock ( around $6o ) COBBLER 'S BENCH Whether a detailed one used by a professional cobbler or one of the simple rough ones that every farmhouse had and used up to about 1900 , these benches all have one problem in common . And that is that the legs get loose where they were inserted in a hole in the seat plank and then the top of the leg was split and expanded with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punky just squirting some glue in the cracks wo n't work very well . For a good job knock the leg out of its hole with a hammer . Working from the bottom , chisel away the soft wood . Scrape the dirt and old glue off the top of the leg , and put it back in with a couple of wedges to hold it at the right angle . Soak the open surfaces around the top of // the leg with Weldwood glue . And finally stuff the spaces with a putty made by mixing sawdust into about a half a cup of Weldwood glue . When this putty has dried it hardens to the strength of hard oak , and can be sanded or ground or filed smooth . DECORATIONS By " decorations " I mean the flat-backed carvings or mouldings that are glued and nailed with small brads to the surfaces of furniture . The French went big for this in their Louis and Regency styles . The Adams brothers picked it up in England ; then you find it a lot in our own Renaissance Victorian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find stuff like this in your run of the mill hardware store in East Punkin , Vermont , or probably even in Rutland . You have to get to a city big enough to have some interior decorators in it , because they are the ones that use a lot of this stuff . Then if you are a friendly person , you can ask a decorator where he goes . If not , look in the " yellow pages " under Wood Products and Woodworkers . There is one mail-order house that I know of that has a limited line of these things , and that is Constantine . See Appendix for a description of their catalogue and address . // A lot of the classic styles of furniture ( and their good Grand Rapids reproductions ) have glued on decorations that look like carved wood , but are actually cast out of fine sawdust and some kind of glue . At any rate , if you are missing one of these you can get them from the Constantine mail-order catalogue . ( See Appendix . ) The above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find an exact match , knock the other one off and get two . // DESKS All the constructional problems you run across in desks are the same as those found in Chests of Drawers and Blanket Chests for which see listings above . For the special hardware used to lower some of the slant fronts , see the catalogue section in the back of the book . DRY SINKS For general construction problems see Blanket Chests and Chests of Drawers . The old ones are pretty scarce , but you can still find a few in the Back Kingdom of Maine , and in the spring they still come into Defoy in the Province of Quebec . FLOORS I do n't think the inclusion of floors in a book on restoring antiques is too far-fetched . After all , houses get to be antiques and people who care about antiques usually commit the ultimate folly of buying an antique house sooner or later . Besides , I know something interesting about old floors . Straight ammonia will dissolve the original bloodmilk paint on the old pine floors of Early American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the summer with the windows open and preferably // wearing a gas mask . But you do n't have to mop up the gunk afterward . You just lean in the window with a garden hose and flush it down the cracks . That 's good for the foundation . Tightens it up . Annoys the hell out of termites , too . And you can do the same thing with water-solvent paint removers for more recent layers of paint . This will give you floors that are a lot more authentic than if you sand them down , which is an atrocious thing to do to a really historic house . The most frustrating problem with old pine floors is the way the cracks between the old wide boards keep opening and closing . The expansion of the boards in summer and contraction of them in winter works loose any filler put into the cracks ? that is if you are a compulsive type that wants a floor sanded perfectly smooth . The trouble is that you are asking wide pine boards to be something that they are n't . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old wide pine boards , for heavens sake ? What we used to do ? and you still could ? was to fill them with a putty made by mixing sawdust with a mixture of half black paint and half spar varnish . You do n't try to bring this up to level , but push it in until you have shallow culverts running between the boards . This mixture is elastic enough so that the opening of any new cracks will be rare . But if you can stand the incredible cost of it , there is now on the market a modern caulking compound under // a variety of trade names that is the perfect material f , this job . Their generic name is " phenolic caulking co pounds , " and the one we get in New England is typ ' cally called Phenoseal , which you get through paint an . hardware stores or at boatyards . This lovely stuff corn , in regular caulking-gun cartridges in white , gray an , black , black being the one for floor cracks . It squirts i easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when dry ? in twenty-four hours . The only trouble ' that it costs ( at this writing , and I 'm sure things will gworse ) two dollars a cartridge , and I used up ten on th last old wideboard kitchen floor I fixed up ! Assuming you have a sanded floor ? and I suppose have to accept the fact that this is what most peopl prefer ? you are naturally going to want to varnish i Well , do n't . Modern varnishes are a great tough fil but they do n't work on soft old pine . They work on as and maple fine , but on soft pine they indent and crac every time you lean back in a chair . For soft old pine yo need the kind of wood sealers that are sold for use o basketball courts , usually indicated by incorporating th word " gym " in their names . This stuff sinks deep in the surface of old pine . In fact the pine sucks it in like sponge . So two or three coats are necessary . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but wears like iro Well anyway , oak . On top of this you should . natural use Old English floor wax . // FRAMES , GILDED It comes as a shock to some people to find out that their ornate gilded frames are really made out of plaster of paris and are n't carved out of wood . Well that 's the way it goes . If you go back to the fifteenth century in Italy , they were carved out of wood alright , but even those had to be faced with plaster of paris ( or the local fine clay equivalent ) to give them a smooth enough surface to take gold leaf ? which needs a very smooth surface so that it can be burnished without rubbing off . And then by Victorian times in the United States ( and anywhere else I guess ) the mass production boys just made solid plaster castings of the most ornate shapes and glued them onto plain frames . Or the whole face may be plaster , in which case the plain wooden frame was pressed into the plaster while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repairing these , broken-off pieces glue back easily enough with ordinary white glue . It is replacing missing parts that is the tricky business . If it is a small piece you can sculpt it out of artist 's modeling clay of the kind that air dries . And if this falls off when it has dried , you just glue it back on with white glue . Of course , that clay takes several days to dry , so if you are in a hurry , you can make a plaster of paris paste that takes about fifteen minutes to set by mixing it up with a solution of one-
