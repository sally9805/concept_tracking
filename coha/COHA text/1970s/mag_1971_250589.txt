For eight years a Pharmaceuticals salesman in New York City endured a Kafkaesque nightmare , applying for work to many firms and always being turned down , sometimes after he had been told that he was accepted . Reason : Atlanta 's Retail Credit Co. , one of the largest firms in the business of gathering and selling financial information about individual consumers , had been reporting erroneously that the salesman was dishonorably discharged from the Army . This was just one of many examples of damaging irresponsibility in the credit-investigation field uncovered in recent hearings before the Senate Subcommittee on Banking and Currency . <P> The thousands of computerized , credit-checking bureaus across the country constitute an awesome but lightly regulated intelligence network . The information they supply to stores , banks , insurance companies and employers intimately affects the borrowing potential , earning power and reputations of millions of Americans . Yet many are oblivious to the existence , much less the extent or accuracy , of the data that credit bureaus disseminate about them . <P> To give consumers protection against abuses , Congress passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week . The measure was adopted after testimony revealed that information on consumers is sometimes hastily collected for the credit-reporting bureaus by recent high school graduates , who get their information by checking newspaper reports of arrests and by secretly interviewing neighbors of the people under investigation . Prodded by supervisors trying to justify the service , some investigators aim for a 10% to 15% rejection rate in their reports . <P> Under the new law , however , if an applicant is rejected for a loan , a job or an insurance policy because of an unfavorable credit report , he must be told so by the person turning him down . He then has the right to examine the bureau 's files ; if he can prove that an item is inaccurate , it must be struck out . Bureaus must also be certain that their clients have a bona fide interest in the individual 's background . Finance companies are acceptable ; lawyers looking for ammunition in a divorce case are not . The FBI , the Internal Revenue Service and other Government agencies , which had easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to peek at an individual 's dossier ( except for checks on prospective employees ) . Credit-bureau officials who knowingly supply data to unauthorized clients risk a year in jail and a $5,000 fine . Says Senator William Proxmire , Wisconsin Democrat , who husbanded the bill through Congress : " At some point the individual 's right to privacy must take precedence over the creditor 's right to obtain information .
