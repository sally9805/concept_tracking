txt CAIRO ? " I 'm going to go crazy if I ca n't find some place else to live , " Fawzi Mansour Abu Lila said . " My relatives refuse to come and visit us here . Can you blame them ? " Abu Lila 's two-room dwelling is humble , but not bad by some Cairo standards . His problem , however , is that several bodies are buried in the yard , and the neighborhood is full of them . Abu Lila , 40 , his wife , and six children are among an estimated 350,000 persons who live in Cairo 's vast City of the Dead graveyard because of an acute shortage of housing in this sprawling city with a population of more than 8 million . " I 'M OBLIGED to live among dead people , but I do n't like it , " said Abu Lila , an employe of a building materials firm who was transferred to Cairo seven years ago from his hometown of Asdylut In southern Egypt . " I 've appealed to my company to send me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have told me it is under study . " Egypt 's housing problem is an outgrowth of a birth rate that is among the highest in the world and that has been little affected by family planning programs . The population is variously estimated at 38-40 million , and each year it grows by one million . All are crowded together in an area less than the combined size of Vermont and New Hampshire  --  the 15,000 square miles of Egypt that are not desert . BY.THE end of the century the population is expected to approach 70 million . The government ? estimates there is a shortage of 750,000 housing emits in Cairo . Many people live in precarious leantos on the roofs of dilapidated buildings , in tin shanties , in basement garages , and on abandoned building sites . By these standards , the inhabitants of the City of the Dead are fortunate . The City of the Dead , a six-mile-long strip of cemeteries along the northeastern rim of Cairo , contains an estimated .100,000 tombs , many of them elegant mausoleums  --  some 500 years old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mainly Circassian slaves brought by Saladin to fight his wars in the 13th Century . They later became the rulers of Egypt . A typical tomb consists of several rooms , with one reserved as a burial crypt and one or two as a place for family members to stay while visiting the tombs on religious holidays . The rooms are built around a courtyard , and in many instances bodies are buried beneath the courtyard , with stairs leading down to the graves . Technically It is illegal to live there , but families who own tombs generally . are happy to have squatters to guard the graves . The city of Cairo extended water and electricity service to the residents about 15 years ago . Schools also operate in some of the larger tombs , shops have been established , and the " city " has its own police stations . THE POPULATION of the City of the Dead swelled , after an estimated 700,000 persons were evacuated from the Suez Canal Zone because of Israeli shelling between 1967 and 1973 .

" When the owners of the tomb come around , we have to pretend we are guards appointed by the caretakers , " he said . Afifi Ahmed Afifi , 27 , one of Abu Lila 's neighbors who was born in the City of the Dead , recalls that as a boy he used to hide among the coffins , and sleep there , to escape his father 's wrath when they quarreled . " It means nothing to me , " he said . President Anwar Sadat has set construction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Other officials maintain that equal priority should be given to lowering the birth rate . " OUR BIGGEST single problem is In the family planning area , " said Ali Gamal Nazer , undersecretary of the economy . Population experts started warning back in the 1030s that Egypt faced an explosive problem , but it was not until 1066 that the government offically recognized it by launching a family planning program . At that time the birth rate was 43 per 1,000 population . Today , after 11 years of promoting contraception through 3,400 health units around the country , the government has managed to bring it down only to 37 per 1,000 . " The problem is in the rural area , which accounts for 56 per cent of the population , " said Dr. Mustapha H. Sammaa , deputy chairman of the Population and Family Planning Board . " IT IS IN the interest of the rural peasant , socially and economically , to have a large family . He plans on having at least 10 children , because he knows three or four may die . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one of the highest in the world . " Lots of children mean more hands to work in the fields . They mean security in old age , And the wife often wants a large number of children because she believes her husband will then be less likely to divorce her and marry another woman . " He said surveys have shown the average number of children desired by an Egyptian couple is 4.5. - Sammaa said a task force study concluded recently that traditional family planning methods have reached a plateau . " We concluded that the services available could only satisfy latent ? demand , but mot create new demand , " he said . TILE TASK FORCE has told the government the best way to lower the birth rate is to remove the incentives for large families by greater employment of women , mechanization of agriculture , industrialization , broadened social security coverage , and improved sanitation to lower the infant mortality ' rate .

" In the Nile delta town of Sirs EI-Layan , a cotton and cereal-groWing community of 20,000 population about 30 miles north of . Cairo , Dr. Hamdi Sharaf talks about the difficulty of promoting family services . OF 2,000 WOMEN of child-bearing nge in the town , he said , only about 450 participate in family planning and the dropout rate is 10 per cent a year . " It 's difficult to get women interested until they have had at least three children , " he said . " In some cases , the husbands refuse to let them participate , and some of the women say they are too busy to come to our clinic .

Only about five women in the village use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have never been introduced in . Egypt , and abortion is illegal . ONE PROBLEM In promoting family planning has been resistande from religious authorities . An Islamic conference in 1074 concluded that nothing in the Koran ' can be read as opposing family planning , but Sammaa said some sheikhs continue to argue that such programs are contrary to religious law . " Thirty to 35 per cent of ' them are illiterate , so it 's not surprising , " he said . Sammaa believes wilh an almost rollgious zeal himself that family planning must be pushed more vigorously than it has to date . " If this problem continues , it will destroy all hopes of development and progress and , in fact , threaten our very existence , " he said .
