txt The State Senate , after five straight hours of emotional debate , today voted 31-to-2G to replace the state 's 19th-century abortion law with one of the most liberal measures in the country . The bill . which would allow a pregnant woman and her doctor to decide the question of abortion , now goes to the Assembly , where it is expected to be debated next week . The measure contained no time limits on when abortions could be performed , no residency requirements or restrictions on how many times a woman could obtain an abortion  --  all points that had been raised by opponents of the bill . Assembly supporters , many of whom crowded into the Senate chamber jammed with spectators for the debate , which was described as " one of the most historic " of the Senate 's history , are optimistic of its chances in that chamber . Reformers in the Assembly have carried the battle unsuccessfully for the last five years and believe passage by the Senate  --  which is normally the more conservative house ? is the key to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called for reform and is considered likely to sign the bill should it reach his desk . In Maryland , the House of Delegates approved a bill to repeal the state 's laws regulating abortions . The measure now goes to the State Senate . Page 38 . The present New York State law , - one of the most restrictive in the country , permits abortions only to save the mother 's life and reformers have argued that it favors the rich who can obtain psychiatric reports to support a legal abortion , and forces the poor to resort to " butchers who illegally ply the trade " of abortions . Senate galleries were packed with spectators and a wall of staff members  --  mostly women ? circled the Senate floor , pressing against the backs of the rear row of Senate seats through the long hours of debate . The glaring lights of television  --  permitted to record the debate under a waiver of Senate rules barring photographers ? filtered through clouds of smoke , but the stuffy chamber was orderly through the long // hours of oratory . Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a round of hissing ? was a request for order required . From the first , the debate was directed at a personal level , as 57 men attempted to change a law that many women contend is of primary concern only to women . ? Senator D. Clinton Dominick , a Newburgh Republican and chief sponsor of the reform bill , led the way by pointing out that in his attempt to understand women he would have to relate to " one woman ? my wife . " Mr. Dominick , the father of " five wanted and 13ved children , " said his wife had recently discussed the matter with him and said that , at 48 years of age , she would seek an abortion if faced with another pregnancy . " And you know , " Mr. Dominick said very quietly and matter-of-factly , " I would have helped her . " It was clear from the beginning that Mr. Dominick , who is universally accepted in the Senate as one of its most respected members , was establishing a favorable field of debate for supporters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is nothing worse , " he concluded in his appeal to let women decide whether to bear a child , " than an unwilling mother and the unwanted child . It leads to divorce . It leads to broken homes . It leads to dropouts . It leads to battered children  --  neglected children . " ' The Senate majority leader , Earl W. Brydges , Republican of Niagara Falls , a long-time opponent of abortion reform and one whose opposition could have kept this bill from ever coming to the floor for debate , picked up the personal thread as debate ended . Disturbed by Bill One of the most gifted and persuasive speakers in the chamber , Mr. Brydges did not enter into debate until the roll was being called . " I am terribly disturbed by this bill , " Mr. Brydges said in his clipped , gravel-voiced manner . " I have kept my word to do nothing to keep this bill from coming to the floor or not to lobby personally against it . But I have a deep , real , abiding conviction that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are a bellwether state and many other states will follow our lead . " From the beginning of the debate , members of the Roman Catholic faith , like Mr. Brydges , took great pains to divorce their actions on the bill from the teachings of their religion . However , of the 22 Catholics in the Senate , 18 voted against the bill . The most liberal abortion law in the United States now is Hawaii 's , which went into effect a week ago and made the decision strictly a matter between a woman and her doctor . However , it requires that the woman be a resident of Hawaii for at least 90 days . An abortion to protect a woman 's physical or mental health is authorized in 12 states : if there is indication of fetal malformation in 9 states ; in case of rape in 11 states , and in case of incest in 9 states . A bill similar to the New York bill passed the lower house in Arizona two weeks ago and has gone to the State Senate . Legislation like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The courts have invalided the existing statutes in the District of Columbia and Wisconsin , but the decisions have been appealed , and doctors have not generally begun to perform abortions in these jurisdictions . The New York bill would repeal part of an 87-year-old law which reads : " An abortional act is justifiable when committed upon a female by a duly licensed physician acting under a reasonable belief that such is necessary to preserve the life of such female . " If the bill passed today by the Senate is approved by the Assembly and signed by the Governor , the New York law would be amended to read simply : " An abortional act is justifiable when committed upon a female by a licensed physician . " Other sections of the law would be amended to delete reference to the restriction allowing abortions only when a woman 's life is in danger . Many observers of today 's debate and vote  --  the first time the Senate has considered abortion reform  --  saw the action as an indication that rising public pressure for change is being felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarked , " we could n't even get the thing considered in committee in the Senate and this year it has passed . " Much of the pressure for reform has come from militant feminist groups , but a deep and consistent effort also has come from minority groups whose members most often become statistics in the grim catalogue of women killed by crude , illegal abortions . At 5 P.M. the 29th " yes " vote  --  the number needed for passage of a Senate bill  --  came from Senator Waldaba H. Stewart , a black Democrat from Brooklyn . " I rise to cast the deciding vote , " Mr. Stewart said , " to help move the . Empire State toward a new approach to a new society . We are venturing into new waters , toward a society in which we look honestly at ourselves and our relationships and our failures .. . Mr. President , 1 vote yes . " " Until we are willing to relate to the question of life after birth , I do n't want to hear of any immortality about death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not agree , " he continued , " with those whose morality allows them to support wholesale extermination in wars or who support a welfare system that bring slow death to those who are poor . " Opponents of the bill were equally impassioned in their moral pleas that their moral views could not accept the bill . Of these , Senator Edward S. Lentol , Brooklyn Democrat , was the first to speak of murder in connection with the bill . " Are you here today going to sanctify the killing of a child ? " Mr. Lentol asked . " I am not talking as a Catholic but as one with deep moral convictions and I say this is murder . " Senator John J. Marchi , Staten Island Republican ; companied a long , Yarnbliat philosophical discussion of the issue with color slides o anatomical drawings showing the stages of the development of a fetus . He was trying to convince ' his colleagues that even a 12 week fetus had many , characteristics he equated with human life . Senator William T. Conklin , Brooklyn Republican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of reform , spoke of the joy these " special children " bring to parents and of his deep-seated opposition to those who argued that abortion was justified to avoid the birth of retarded children .
