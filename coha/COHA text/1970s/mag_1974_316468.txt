Most astronomers believe that the universe was born billions of years ago in a so-called " Big Bang " -a violent explosion of a primordial clump of matter . Ever since , fragments of that clump - consisting largely of the islands of stars called galaxies-have been flying apart . But the universe is expanding at a steadily decreasing speed ; the outward flight of each galaxy is being slowed by the pull of gravity from the others . If that pull is strong enough , the galaxies will eventually be braked to a halt . Then they will begin falling back to crush together in a final cataclysm . If the tug of gravity is too weak , the universe will continue to expand forever . <P> An infinitely expanding universe is a concept that does not sit well with many scientists , but in their search of the heavens , astronomers have so far found only a fraction of the mass needed to produce enough gravitational force to halt and reverse the outward flight . Now , Astrophysicist Jeremiah P. Ostriker of Princeton University thinks that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At a recent meeting of the American Physical Society in Chicago , he suggested that enough mass to " close " the universe may be hidden in great halos of matter around the galaxies . His evidence comes not from direct observation of those halos , but from some scientific deduction based on Newtonian physics . <P> Newton 's laws dictate that the farther a planet is from the sun , the slower will be its speed in orbit . The planet Jupiter ( fifth from the sun ) , for example , moves much more slowly than the earth ( third from the sun ) . The same rules should apply to the billions of stars revolving around the central cores of distant galaxies , or to one galaxy revolving around another . In measuring the rotational velocity of the stars or galaxies , however , astronomers have discovered a perplexing fact : when the total observable mass of the galaxies is taken into account , the stars do not seem to slow their rotation sufficiently . <P> In an effort to account for this phenomenon , Ostriker worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the galaxies actually have ten times more mass than has been seen through the telescopes of earthbound observers , the velocities of the stars would satisfy Newton 's laws . Ostriker theorizes that the mass exists in invisible halos of small , dim stars , interstellar dust and gases , and perhaps even " black holes " - cadavers of huge , ancient stars , so completely collapsed under their own powerful gravity that not even light can escape from them . <P> If such hidden mass really exists , astronomers may soon know . Several of the largest telescopes are being trained on far galaxies in a search for hard , observational evidence of Ostriker 's halos.
