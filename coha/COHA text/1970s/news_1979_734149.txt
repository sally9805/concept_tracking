txt Would phasing out price controls on US crude oil really boost production ? New doubts are being raised about this in the wake of President Carter 's proposal April 5 to let price controls gradually expire during the next 28 months . A White House fact sheet indicates this " phased decontrol " should result in added production of about 200,000 barrels a day in 1980 . That would rise to about a million barrels a day by 1985 . Critics , however , including those from the industry , call the projections too optimistic  --  and suggest production could actually slump under the President 's latest energy proposals . Energy Secretary James R. Schlesinger , detailing the plan April 9 to Congress , said oil industry revenues should soar about $17 billion between now and 1981 . New taxes , he explained , would be delayed until that date . After that time , higher federal taxes would soak up half the added $15 billion in new annual revenues the oil industry could expect to receive under decontrol . However , at least three hurdles lie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various industry analysts . 1 . The new " windfall profits " tax . Along with decontrol , the White House would slap a 50 percent tax atop the regular corporate profits tax . While total industry profits should rise , even with this tax , the increase will be far less than originally expected . // From  --  a e 1 Lifting oil price lid 2 . Distrust of the White House . Presidential rhetoric that talks of " rip-offs , " " undeserved windfall profits , " " loopholes , " and firms that would " cheat , " all add to industry doubts . Administration officials say they will decontrol prices even if Congress does n't pass a " windfall profits " tax ? but many do n't believe it . 3 . Resistance in Congress . Sen. Henry M. Jackson ( D ) of Washington , chairman of the Senate Energy Committee , says he will fight to keep the present system of regulation on oil prices for at least two additional years . That controversy will spread another cloud of doubt over the industry , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ October . While much of the federal government 's fire is directed at the large , billion-dollar oil firms , 90 percent of America 's exploratory drilling actually is performed by smaller independent companies and individuals . Howard Useem , chief economist for the Independent Petroleum Association of America , which represents about half the nation 's 10,000 independent producers , says the President 's plan " is n't decontrol . " " This is just an exchange of one set of government controls for another , " Mr. Useem says . The independents are also worried about Mr. Carter 's rhetoric , Mr. Useem says . " Many of these producers work alone ? just them , their two kids , and maybe a partner or two . They try to do what 's right . They 're patriotic ... and then the President comes on TV and accuses them of stealing the country blind , and they get angry . " Furthermore , says Mr. Useem , these small producers are extremely reliant on cash flow . New taxes will both add to their regulkory burden and deplete the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If all these barriers can be bridged , oil industry sources say there is little doubt that output can be increased ? perhaps even beyond White House estimates . Oil industry sources say as much as 2 million barrels a day could be added to the 10 million currently being pumped daily in the US . ? This new oil would come from several sources . " Infill drilling , " putting more wells into known fields , would bring the quickest results , oil industry analysts say . That could bring added production onto the market within the next 24 months . Deeper wells in old fields , such as the Jay Field in Florida- and Alabama , could also be expected to bring in more oil . " Enhanced recovery , " using costly , advanced methods would be affordable under true decontrol . Finally , higher prices should encourage additional efforts , both offshore and in hostile onshore areas such as Alaska . One analyst with the American Petroleum Institute suggests that the most hopeful remaining area may be onshore Alaska ? but wells there can cost $20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Oklahoma .
