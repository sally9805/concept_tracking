txt The Rev. Francis X. Lawlor , alderman-elect from the predominantly white 15th Ward , ca n't figure out why everyone is so surprised over his visit with black Ald.-elect Anna Langford in the neighboring black fah Ward . True , there are some who believed him to be a white segregationist after his run-ins with his Roman Catholic order a few years back , when he was suspended . " Easy to Talk to " Mrs. Langford said she " ca n't believe people are this surprised about two people acting with some degree of intelligence . " She had had some indication he would be visiting her , she I said , because representatives of both wards already had met a few days ago . " We talked two hours . He was easy to talk to . To me , be did n't come across like a racist . We just sat there and discussed things . Before the election , people were saying Father Lawlor and I would be slugging it out . " Carrying Out Plan But in his unannounced visit Thursday night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was only doing what I attempted to do in ' 67 and ' 68 when John- Cardinal Cody stopped me without giving me a chance to explain what I was doing , " Lawlor said yesterday in an interview . He thinks his racial stand has been misrepresented . " In the meantime since the suspension , there has been a lot of crime , a lot of dead youngsters , a lot of burned-out buildings , " he said . " Maybe a lot of this could have been avoided if the political power s and the civil rights groups and the churches had cooperated with what I was attempting , rather than lower the boom on it . " He said he bad been plan . ning to visit Mrs. Langford for quite a while . Thursday night he went to visit burned-out buildings in his own ward , then just kept on walking to Mrs. Langford 's law office on 63d Street . Compliments Her Ability " It looked like a bombed-out area , " he said . " We 've got mutual interests ? schools , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more to follow up on . " She was a gracious host . She 's dedicated to the people , not to a party , and that makes a difference . She has a legal mind and talent , plus a womanly interest , and women like Anna Langford can make the difference for America . " I 've got no plans to expand the contact to other minority aldermen ; this is our bag down here . Everybody has been trying to build walls , mostly paper walls from the press . I 've been trying to build understand . ing . From the time of Cody , the whole thing has been miss represented . The minds of tot many people have been pois oned about what I 'm trying to do . " Explains Block Clubs What he did was organize block clubs to try to keep the whites in the city . He said he wants to make both the 15th and 16th Wards desirable places to live so whites wo n't flee to the suburbs and blacks wo n't flee to other areas of the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be trying to help ourselves , too , and get people to work together , " he said . " It 's not going to happen overnight , but it will during our terms of office . We have the brain and the brawn ; we have the numbers . Now it 's a matter of organizing . Like the Back of the Yards , we will work out our own destiny . " Mrs. Langtora s auttuae was to wait and see . And the two found many common points of agreement , she said . Both , she said , want to integrate the schools west of Ashland and " integrate the whole area peacefully . Whites do have a stake . They should not panic at the first sight of a black . " Good for Both Integration would be good for both , she believes . She has seen problems in all-black wards ? she believes that when a ward becomes all black , the city ignores it . She also has a concern for the black families who already live in Lawlor 's ward , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understanding among all people in the two wards .
