 | SOCIALISM IN CHINA It works . This is the conclusion that I brought home after observing the animated life on the crowded streets in five large Chinese cities , visiting communal farms , factories , and schools , and watching the endless panorama of the Chinese countryside glide by during long railroad trips through the eastern provinces . The 800,000,000 people ? this total may be smaller , no one knows for sure ? seem to be enjoying a decent , purposeful , and organized life , an equitable distribution of income and . for the time being at least , social harmony and peace . The contrast with the sea of misery and utter destitution enveloping the small islands of conspicuous prosperity and opulence in the rest of the so-called underdeveloped world is so striking that it is almost unbelievable . The train ride I quote from my diary from Hong Kong to Canton consists of two distinct parts : the first from Hong Kong to the border , the second from the border to Canton . The basic contours of the landscape are the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rising in the distance , freshwater creeks , canals , lakes , and ponds . On the low levels lush vegetation and intensive agricultural cultivation . The villages one passes on the first part of the trip are typical examples of the rural squalor one is accustomed to seeing in India and Puerto Rico or , closer to home , in poor backward areas of the old South . Creeks flowing by clusters of peasant dwellings are hardly more than open sewers , their shores strewn with debris and refuse of all kinds ; yards behind the huts and even the streets in front are garbage dumps . On the other side of the border ? as seen from my train window ? ducks and geese swim in the ponds , and the shores and backyards are not disfigured by trash . Later , on the longer train rides from Peking to Nanking , to Hangchow , and finally to Shanghai . over a thousand miles of rural countryside unraveled before our eyes : small towns , cities and villages , cornfields , rice paddies , irrigation canals , lakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plowing , harvesting , weeding , threshing ; little girls and boys watering buffalo , shepherding large flocks of geese and ducks or herds of pigs ; fishermen casting their nets ; gangs of workers laying railroad tracks ; carts pulled by donkeys , buffalo , or men , transporting stone , brick , sorghum. sugarcane , and other agricultural products . Masons were laying walls , lining irrigation ditches , building arching bridges over the canals ; women were washing laundry and attending to household chores in their backyards . There was n't an idle person anywhere . The prevailing agricultural technology is traditional , not to say medieval . Except for an occasional motor-driven water pump , most tasks are performed with the help of ingeniously contrived handmade wooden tools .  | To be sure , when you visit an agricultural commune you 'd think that trucks and tractors , harvesters , threshing machines , and chemical fertilizers were being introduced at a rapid pace , but there are obviously not enough of them to change the character of the landscape or to make decisive inroads on traditional , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electric lights , the well-known industrial exposition in Canton contained displays of foot-pedal-powered movie projectors and operating-room equipment . In many rural regions electricity is probably an exception rather than the rule . However , statistical information that could confirm this and similar conjectures does not seem to be available , at least not to a foreign visitor . @# The crowds in downtown streets of Peking . Shanghai , Nanking , and Canton corroborate the impression of the busy , purposeful existence that one sees in the country . Swarms of bicycles ( instead of our swarms of cars ) , large and small stores , eating places and refreshment stands are all full of customers . A group of neatly dressed , giggling schoolgirls are engaged in the task ? unusual for our schoolchildren ? of constructing a low brick wall . Some mix mortar , some chip old bricks clean , and others lay them , handling the trowel with almost professional skill . Across the street a troop of children , plastic school bags slung over shoulders , move along holding hands and singing with some discord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ song . On a playground at the corner teen-age boys play basketball . The most conspicuous expression of the egalitarian spirit in the new China is the neat loose-fitting shirt and trousers ? blue , white , or gray ? worn by men and women , young and old , on city streets . in offices , factories , and in the fields . But what is truly startling is the total absence of hungry and sickly men , women , and children in rags ? a sight so familiar to visitors in any underdeveloped area in Asia , Africa , or Latin America . According to current unofficial estimates , the average per capita income in China is somewhere between $150 and $170 per year , which is less than in many other underdeveloped countries and less than one-twentieth the average per capita income ( 1971 estimate , $3600 ) in the United States . But in China basic human needs absorb a fraction of the material costs needed to satisfy the demands of the high- and middle-income groups in our industrialized , prosperous society , and general living conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disadvantaged Americans at the bottom rung of our economic ladder . The " average " figures in present-day China , however , are not abstractions ; with little variation , they apply to nearly everybody . @# In China , for example , bicycles play the same important , not to say indispensable , role that private cars play in the United States . Not only does the factory worker , schoolteacher , and many a farmer rely on his two-wheeler to get to and return from work ; he also uses it for shopping trips and Sunday outings . The average monthly wage of a Chinese worker is 70 yuan ( according to the official exchange rate , 1 yuan is worth 47 cents , in purchasing power somewhat more ) ; the price of a new bicycle is about 140 yuan ? that is , two months ' wages . The average American worker earns about $400 a month and a new car costs in the neighborhood of $3000 or more , the equivalent of roughly seven months ' American pay . Thus , normal needs for personal transportation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a proportion of their yearly income , than a one-car family spends in the United States . The situation would , of course , be different if Mr. Wong owned a car and Mr. Wang , sensitive to his neighbor 's material progress , began to take a dim view of his bicycle . The span between the lowest and the highest income in today 's China is so narrow , however , that no significant difference between the life-styles of Mr. Wang and Mr. Wong arises . In an agricultural commune , a textile mill , and a machine tool plant , in a department store or in a hospital , as well as in the universities I visited , the ratio of the highest earnings to the lowest seems to be typically three to one , or , when compared across the board , four to one . No one is rich or even very well-to-do and , what is most important , no one is seriously deprived or destitute . The three basic staples ? rice and grain , cooking oil , and cotton cloth ? are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a pound and a half of rice or other grains per day per person ) ; the cloth ratio is short : it is equivalent to two jackets , shirts , or blouses and two pairs of pants per year . However , rayon , wool , and other fabrics are not rationed , and judging by the well-stocked shelves in stores and by the neat appearance of people everywhere , are in ample supply . They are priced higher than cotton . Work clothing is supplied on the job . A large district food store we visited in Peking has separate departments for dairy products , groceries , meat , fish poultry , fruit , and vegetables . Seventeen varieties of vegetables were arranged on the counter ; three grades of chicken eggs , as well as duck and goose eggs . After selecting one of the live fowls displayed in cages , the customer takes it home ten minutes later plucked and dressed . There are no long queues and the sales personnel I observed seemed characteristically helpful . Eighty percent of the Chinese population live and work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Numbering up to sixty thousand people , a commune is essentially a large administrative and managerial unit . Each settlement or village makes up 75  | a productive brigade . The actual operating unit is a production team that usually consists of one hundred to two hundred workers . Farming is supposed to be the main business of agricultural communes . The prosperous commune which I visited some sixty miles from Shanghai allocates only one-fifth of its labor force to industrial production , but this accounts for a full half of the commune 's total revenue . A basket-weaving establishment , a fertilizer plant , a shop manufacturing a simple type of threshing machine , and even a plant engaged in producing metal pipe might by some stretch of the imagination be viewed as a natural extension of the commune 's agricultural pursuits . But the factory turning out twenty thousand electric bulbs daily hardly could be justified on those grounds . The commune is not an enterprise bent on maximizing the net revenue from the pursuit of one particular line of production . Rather , it is a social organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working conditions for several thousand families in a particular location . Obviously , this purpose can be served better if diversified manufacturing employment is provided for members of what was a purely agricultural community . Economic planners in Peking pursue systematic policies of decentralization . The long-distance transportation needs of that vast country have put severe strains on the well-run , but greatly overloaded , railroads ; these are assisted to some extent by coastal and internal waterways . ( The Great Canal connecting the southern provinces with Peking is being restored after many years of neglect . ) Although the Chinese automobile industry is still quite small , each province has already developed facilities for producing its own trucks . But would n't emphasis on self-sufficiency tend to perpetuate the disparity between the standard of living in regions enjoying particularly fertile land and favorable climate and those that have neither ? The answer given me was that this strategy seems to be the most effective means of encouraging local effort and initiative . While in the long run the progressive spread of industrial activities ? concentrated in and around a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the disparity between material conditions of life in the cities and life in the country , other means are employed by the government to narrow this disparity more quickly . First of all , the agricultural tax , that is , the obligatory delivery of farm products to the government , was frozen several years ago in actual quantities of produce to be delivered , so that with the steady increase in production , the tax , expressed in percentage terms , fell from 12 to only 6 percent of the total output of agricultural communes . At the same time , the prices paid by governmental pro- curement agencies for farm products purchased b% them were raised , while retail prices at which they are sold to consumers were kept constant . The difference between the two is covered by subsidies financed from general public revenues . These revenues , incidentally , consist , in addition to the agricultural tax , of a turnover tax included in the price of all manufactured products and of profits from manufacturing and other productive enterprises owned by the government . The turnover tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much more equal distribution of income in China , it does not have the same regressive effects that the similar value-added tax being contemplated by the Nixon Administration would have in the United States . Moreover , luxuries are taxed higher than necessities ; the sales levy on imported watches is as high as 400 percent . The manpower policies of the government provide another effective means of counteracting undesirable tendencies toward inequalities which a single-minded emphasis on self-help might bring about . While in the United States the last vestige of obligatory public service will disappear with the replacement of the draft by voluntary military forces , in China military conscription provides a powerful device to make a very large number of young men and women serve not only the national defense but also many other kinds of public needs . For the 80 percent of the total population living in rural areas , the baggy green cotton army uniform and the cap with its small red star ? worn without distinctions by all ranks ? is no doubt the symbol of a most demanding kind of public service . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observed these green-clad figures performing ? either individually or in small groups ? daily calisthenic drills , then turning to entirely nonmilitary tasks such as cutting grass in the parks , turning it and drying it for hay . Through the windows of a train , I saw soldiers working on the tracks . An equally and probably more significant method of bridging the gap between town and country is the organized flow of young people from cities to remote agricultural regions . After graduation from high school , the seventeen- and eighteen-year-old boys and girls do a two- or three-year stint in agricultural communes . For this experience they are prepared in advance by the great emphasis put on manual work in all school curricula . I 've already spoken of high-school girls building a brick wall . One day ( sometimes one and a half days ) of the regular six-day school week is spent in shop or in other activities referred to as productive work . I saw these teen-age boys and girls shaping and welding bicycle wheel rims , stamping out and assembling parts for electric transformers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wooden boxes on an assembly line . In public parks one often sees groups  | of youngsters weeding lawns or planting flowers , their lunch boxes waiting on nearby benches . Students in universities and other institutions of higher education , while attending to their regular course work , are engaged at the same time in rather sophisticated productive tasks . On visits to Peking University , and to Futan University in Shanghai , we saw the students constructing oscillographs , manufacturing miniaturized integrated circuits , industrial lasers , and other types of scientific instruments and specialized industrial equipment . All professional and managerial personnel in various institutions have to spend a part of every year in a factory or on a farm doing manual labor . @# Mobility , or should one say adaptability , to spartan conditions of personal life is facilitated by ample provision of social services not available or available only to a limited extent even in such advanced countries as the United States . A working mother ? in China all women seem to be working ? leaves her child in a nursery school , kindergarten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of work . In the textile plant we visited , in addition to the half-hour lunch break , mothers were permitted to run over to the nursery twice a day to see how things were going . In case of need , the children can be left in these institutions overnight or even for a week . Both of my interpreters , a young woman and a young man studying in the Institute of Western Languages in Peking , were married . Their spouses worked , one as a technician in an airplane engine plant , the other as a teacher in a primary school . Both places of employment are situated on the outskirts of the town far from the university . During the week they lived in dormitories where they worked , and on weekends each couple was reunited in its own small apartment in town . A typical rent for working-family living quarters is 24 yuan ( $14 ) a year . In China there is a universal six-day work week , with only five additional national holidays per year . Those whose next of kin live in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave . Travel time is added to these fourteen days and the round-trip fare is paid by the organization to which one belongs . Retirement age ? the age at which one may but does not have to quit work ? is fifty-five for women and sixty for men . These relatively low limits are , I suppose , attributable to the great physical exertion required by the generally traditional technology in China . Industrial workers are retired at 70 percent of their highest rate of pay . In the agricultural commune we visited , retired members have to be supported by their children . If they have no children , the responsibility reverts to the commune : these elderly people continue to live in their own homes , but take their meals and spend much of their time on a rotating basis with neighbors . In a country where old age was always held in great esteem , such an arrangement would appear to be not only humane but practical as well . In addition to a secure old age , the commune solemnly guarantees each member 's right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family is now a thing of the past , the smaller family is used as a basic building block of the social organization . On a visit to a hospital , for example , my attention was directed to a patient being cared for by his wife and his daughter . " Eight hundred million people are more than enough for any country . " This or other similar remarks usually introduce the description of comprehensive measures taken to keep down the population growth . The usual marriage age is 26-27 for women and 28-29 for men . Neither of the two couples I mentioned above had any children as yet . A great variety of birth-control methods is not only made available to all but is systematically promoted by personal counseling to small groups and to individuals . The charge for an abortion is one dollar . In the cities these measures are said to have brought the birthrate down . In a suburban agricultural commune the birthrate is estimated at 3 percent , the death rate at 1 ? percent , which yields a growth rate of 1 ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth rate is still quite high . @# How about the overall performance of the economy ? American visiting economists are told that they will have to wait for a " normalization of the relationship between our countries " before they can be given a reasonably full quantitative answer to this question . Judging by what was said in a day-long discussion with members of the Economic Institute of the Academy of Sciences in Peking and by what one saw and heard during the rest of the trip , the management of the economy as reconstituted after the Cultural Revolution is circumspect and careful rather than bold and experimental . The typical order of priorities dominating the economic policies of most socialist and many nonsocialist developing countries is reversed . In China agriculture comes first , light industry second , and heavy industry last . In other words , to maintain and to increase the level of consumption are considered to be more important than large investments in building up industry and productive facilities so as to secure higher standards of living for remote future generations . This does not mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the contrary , experts estimate the present growth rate of the Chinese economy to be not less than 6 and possibly as high as 7 percent a year . Investment is financed not only by central gov- ernment revenues , which consist of retained earnings of industrial enterprises and agricultural communes , but also through individual savings . Not only workers but also members of farm communes are said to be depositing as much as 10 percent of their income in savings accounts . In the latter case the income is derived not only from " work points " earned in communal labor but also from sales ? to the government ? of pigs and other animals and produce raised on tiny " private " family plots . No public services , except schools , seem to be entirely free ; however , the charges are moderate , to say the least : entrance to the Forbidden City in Peking , now operated as a gigantic museum and recreation ground , costs five cents , a visit to a doctor , ten cents . A day spent in a hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expenses . Even these charges are , however , paid by the factory , the commune , or whichever other organization one belongs to . The methods of economic planning and many other formal aspects of economic administration seem to resemble very closely those in the Soviet Union . This is not surprising : during the early formative years of its existence , Russia was the principal , if not the only , mentor China had . The actual contents of these institutional forms differ , however , from what they are in Russia as much as the industrial exhibit now housed in the former palace of Soviet-Chinese Friendship in Shanghai differs from what was originally intended when that towering wedding cake of a building was gratefully received as a present from the Soviet Union . While industrial equipment of quite modern types can be seen in these exhibition halls , the technology mostly used in industry and agriculture is anything but advanced . When asked what goods are to be offered for export in the envisaged expansion of trade with other countries , Chinese experts supplied a list headed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great emphasis seems to be laid on attainment of higher labor productivity through improved management supported by a gradual introduction of newer but well-tested technology , such as wider use of chemical fertilizers , motor-driven portable irrigation pumps and tractors in agriculture , and replacement of steam power by diesel locomotives on the railroads . The disastrous famines which regularly afflicted China in the past have not recurred in recent years . Improved methods of cultivation have certainly helped , but rational overall planning is probably even more important . " We count on two good crops , two bad ones , and one disastrous crop every five years ; this is what we expect and what we have to be prepared for , " we were told . In other words , agricultural planners maintain the food supply by the building up of sufficient buffer stocks . The ancient Chinese emperors used the same type of planning . However , they did so only for the upper classes ; now a steady supply of basic foodstuffs is guaranteed for everyone . Of course , many countries , not only in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , boast much higher average per capita national income and also higher overall rates of growth . But in nearly all of these countries such figures conceal a staggering disparity between the well-to-do and the very poor . If all countries were rated not according to the levels of their average per capita income , but rather according to the average per capita income received by the poorest or 10 percent of their respective total populations . China 's relative standing among countries rated on the basis of average per capita income would in many cases be reversed . Although no figures are available , China , now near the bottom on one scale , would rise quickly much closer to the top . @# The unique accomplishment of socialist China is the establishment and , for the time being at least , effective maintenance of a social and economic order in which , in spite of a very low average per capita income , abject poverty has been virtually eliminated . Despite the modest material returns for their labor , all men and women capable of work appear to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be performing the duties assigned to them with diligence and good cheer . To explain why Chinese planners seem to be succeeding where others fail , it is important to underuand the fundamental distinction between the motivation required for the efficient production of so-called " public , " as contrasted to " private , " goods . In the case of a private good , the connection between the effort exerted by an individual and the product of that effort is unambiguous because it is direct . But if the gains that a member of our competitive society expects to derive from his own individual effort fail to materialize , in principle at least , he has only himself to blame . All he can do is find out what went wrong and try again . Even if he continues to fail , other members of the society can continue to enjoy the same private rewards for their own individual efforts as they did before . Not so in the case of collective action . A persistent discrepancy between promise and actual performance can , and as a matter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the incompetence of or misrepresentation on the part of the leadership and planners , or on antisocial behavior , that is , attempts to steal free rides by other members of the team ; or more often on both . The natural response in either case will be an open or covert copping out , and consequently a progressive disintegration of the entire system . This is one of the reasons why collective enterprise so often limps or  | even fails . The other reason seems to be that the organizers of collective action have a tendency to underestimate the total effort required to do the job and this raises unrealizable expectations and false hopes . In that case , even with the full . cooperation of those called to take part in it , the collective action will founder . Needless to say , disappointment , mutual suspicion , and recrimination are bound to follow . The Chinese planners seem to be able to deliver what they promise . There is , of course , an element of instability in this equilibrium . In spite of the fact that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a member of the team might nevertheless be tempted to get a free ride . Hence the steady stream of propaganda that tries to whip up enthusiasm for efforts on behalf of the common good . But much more important for the success of the Chinese system is the powerful reinforcing action of fulfilled promises themselves . The economists in Peking are aware of the delicate nature of the balance . When asked why the prices of most consumer goods are kept absolutely constant ? save for some seasonal fluctuation ? year after year , they admitted that such rigidity deprives the price system of its ability to function as a shock absorber reducing the discrepancy between supply and demand , but they explained that consumers would be disoriented and disturbed by prices moving erratically up and down . After the convulsions of the Cultural Revolution , economic planners proved themselves capable of satisfying the basic material needs of the entire population and they do not now promise more than that . Their expectations reasonably well fulfilled , the millions of workers seem to be exerting cooperative efforts , thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promise . The steady flow of refugees over the Hongkong border testifies , on the other hand , to the fact that the rigors of communal discipline prove to be unbearable to many of the people . How long can such an equilibrium be maintained ? While anything but stagnant , the predominantly agricultural Chinese economy is still very simple , even primitive . As productive investment grows and technology advances and the population increase slows down , the economy will begin to serve more than just basic material needs . But it will also be more difficult to manage . Decentralization and self-reliance ? as we are about to learn in the United States ? are less effective as the system becomes more complex and the mutual interdependence among different industries and different regions grows . At the same time , even in an egalitarian society , the people , as their basic needs become better satisfied , will want to have more freedom of choice . This applies particularly to freedom in the realm of ideas . In today 's socialist China , freedom of the spoken or written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The leaders would most likely say that such freedom is a luxury that a system based on mutual cooperation in the pursuit of a single common purpose can not afford . They would possibly add that the average man or woman confronted with a choice between the newly acquired sense of economic security and social equality on the one hand and intellectual freedom on the other would prefer the first . This most likely is correct . But it does not settle the issue . In the long run freedom or , to put it more positively , an open conflict of ideas would prove to be an indispensable condition for human progress and social advance . Not unlike food , freedom is a source of direct personal satisfaction , but it is also an indispensable condition of health and normal ' growth . After a long period of malnutrition , the appetite may disappear . But as the experiences of the Soviet Union and other , older socialist countries seem to demonstrate , first a few and then many of the individual organs show signs of debility , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose its capacity for healthy growth . Spasmodic adjustments ? of which the Cultural Revolution is one example ? may compensate for these deficiencies ; on the other hand they may not .
