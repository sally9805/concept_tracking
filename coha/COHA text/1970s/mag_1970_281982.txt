" The peasants are befuddled , " a French businessman said in Phnom-Penh last week . " Prince Sihanouk had been increasingly and-Viet Cong . Now he joins with the Viet Cong to kill Cambodians . I strongly doubt that the peasants will support him , even if he were to return to a ' liberated zone ' in the country . " That appraisal is shared by many observers , Western and Cambodian . If it is accurate , it may mean a considerably longer life for the regime of Premier Lon Nol than seemed possible a short while ago . <P> Partly Illusory . The chunky 56-year-old general , who led the group that ousted Norodom Sihanouk as Cambodia 's chief of state two months ago , has grievous problems nonetheless . Outside the now embattled sanctuaries . <P> Communist forces seem ubiquitous and unbeatable in the entire third of the country east of the Mekong River . Last week they launched a major thrust west of the Mekong as well , when a force of up to 600 Viet Cong and North Vietnamese seized the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forested Route 1 to within 30 miles of Phnom-Penh . <P> Despite the apparent menace , however , there are no hard signs yet that the Communists really intend to attack the capital . Moreover , their successes are at least partly illusory . The North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces have been operating in small bands , occupying a town or blocking a road for a few days , then disappearing when challenged by sizable force . Still , Lon Nol is taking no chances . <P> In Phnom-Penh , soldiers were installing Soviet-made 122-mm. artillery pieces to ward off any thrust from the south . Other troops , including elements of a 3,000-man contingent of Cambodian mercenaries who had fought with American Green Berets in Viet Nam , mounted a counterattack on Neak Luong . The tough , red-scarfed mercenaries , who were airlifted into Phnom-Penh last week to back up Lon Nol 's weak 35,000-man army , expect to link up with South Vietnamese forces that were closing in on Neak Luong at week 's end . <P> Pink Prince . In the political struggle for the loyalties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least holding his own ; at best , he is solidifying his position . He has , in fact , received an unexpected assist from Sihanouk . In Peking last week , the deposed Prince formally set up his own Cambodian government in exile , complete with a twelve-member Cabinet and a platform ineluding items like abolition of polygamy . His self-styled New Royal Government of National Union won instant recognition from several Communist countries , prompting Sihanouk to quip that , as a French-educated aristocrat and heir to a 2,000-year-old monarchy , he could not be a Red but only a " pink Prince . " Cambodia 's predominantly rural people may not be all that amused . They are not so much anti-Communist as anti-Vietnamese , and Sihanouk 's increasing dependence on Hanoi can only weaken his residual popularity . <P> Playing on this sentiment , Lon Nol 's government is continuing its strident campaign against the 500,000-member Vietnamese community . The drive has proved to be the new government 's strongest-if crudest-rallying point . At present , Vietnamese residents of the capital are allowed to leave their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
