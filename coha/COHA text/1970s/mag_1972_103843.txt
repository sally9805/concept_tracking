Could this be the famous Madman Muntz ? This balding little fellow in the gold-rimmed glasses , gazing morosely through a plate-glass window at the autumn gloom and the cranes and bulldozers tearing concrete out of Sepulveda Boulevard in Van Nuys , Calif. ? He folds a leg to sit on a white shoe at his desk ; he scratches ; he glumly lights another Marlboro . Out in the street , past the big sign that says MUNTZ MOTOR MANSIONS , the traffic is blocked into a creeping mess . " They 're killing me with this construction work , killing me , " he says , spinning his gold lighter . " Much more of this , we could be giving our stuff away and not enough people could reach us to carry it all out . " His lament was seasonal ; by spring , when his market hit its peak , the cranes and bulldozers would be gone and prospective buyers would once more flow unvexed along Sepulveda and into his parking lot . But now he fumed .

And MEDICAL AUTHORITIES AGREE : WALKING IS GOOD FOR YOU . ' SELL YOUR CAR TO Muntz . Beside a slogan that says , I buy ' em Retail-sell ' em wholesale MORE FUN THAT WAY ! was the old Madman logo , a little figure wearing a Napoleon hat , with scissors and a chain of paper cutouts . In those days he used to hire airplanes to fly over Los Angeles and other cities spelling out his name in the sky . But he has n't done that in a while now . " With this smog , " he says , " who can see the sky ? " // What Madman Muntz has been able to do better than almost any of his peers during the last 25 years  --  smog or no smog  --  is spot a trend . After cars he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In each case he caught the tide just right and made a lot of money by riding it . Unfortunately , he has not always showed the same acumen about knowing when to bail out . The result has been predictable : each of his fortunes was seriously eroded because he stayed with a good thing until it turned sour  --  and beyond . // Now he thinks he sees another wave rolling in  --  sports motorcycling  --  and he is paddling for all his worth to catch and ride it . No question , lightweight sport cycles , as they are called , are to the Southern California what snowmobiles are to the Minnesota winter sportsman . It is now difficult to climb high enough or walk far enough into the mountains and deserts around L.A. and San Diego to escape these noisy intruders . They are the final noxious link between modern man and the wilderness . Beyond everything , they are ubiquitous . That , at least , is the way Madman Muntz sees it , and he hopes  --  if the L.A. street maintenance people will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vision by marketing his own line of motor homes and Japanese motorcycles in that old , campy , surefire way . // After his period of glory as a used-car dealer Muntz became the nation 's largest individual new-car dealer , selling Kaisers and Frazers , brands of automobiles that have now disappeared and that Muntz says were pretty sorry to begin with . As an auto salesman on a grand scale , Muntz stuck to definite devices . His auto showrooms were open from 7 a.m. until 9 p.m. seven days a week . He insisted that his salesmen be dressed in the Madman 's idea of a sporty image , with their shoes shined and a crease in their trousers but none in their shirtsleeves . ( " A creased shirtsleeve might have been O.K. in New York in those days , " says Muntz , " but in California it was not hep . " ) The salesman would greet the prospect at the door and swiftly deliver him to the turnover man , whose job was to get the name on the contract . Muntz says the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Don Adams ( not the comedian ) , who in one year wrote 5,500 deals . A salesman received only $8 to $10 per car sold , but a salesman who did n't earn $1,000 per month knew he was in trouble . At the end of each month the two lowest-ranking salesmen for that period were automatically fired . // Muntz was still running around with movie stars then and going to nightclubs , and his name was used on the air by his friend Bob Hope as a household gag , as immediately identifiable in its time as , say , Ringo Starr or Knute Rockne in theirs . When the Kaiser-Frazer distributorship bubbled out of sight into a bog of disagreements between Muntz and Henry Kaiser , the Madman was ready to begin selling America what was already , in 1948 , becoming one of its obsessions  --  television . // In 1947 Earl Muntz had grossed $72 million in the auto business and had begun raising money for his TV venture from such investors as Hope and Bert Lahr . He started manufacturing his own TV sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a method designed by Muntz man Rex Wilson . Muntz calls it a " revolutionary simplification " of the TV set . For the first time that clumsy box in the living room did not look like the instrument panel of a twin-engine plane . There were only three knobs on the Muntz set  --  one for channel selection , one for volume and one for picture control . Prices were sensational for the time  --  $199.50 for a 10-inch screen up to $299.50 for a 12-inch consolette. // Muntz poured money into advertising with jingles ( " There 's something about a Muntz TV " and " Cheer , cheer for old Muntz TV " and his musical trademark , the ditty " M-U-N-T-Z , that 's Muntz " to the tune of Strauss ' Artist 's Life waltz ) and commercial messages that promised a Muntz salesman at your house to demonstrate a set within an hour of your phone call . Before long Muntz was making and selling 50,000 sets per month . By 1954 , in fact , Muntz TV was such a flourishing , expanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with being a big dealer is you can get killed fast , " Muntz , 57 , says as he lights another Marlboro and peers out the window at the syrup flow of traffic in front of Muntz Motor Mansions . " You get this momentum going , all these commitments . Two or three bad weeks , you 're burned . Muntz TV was doing $55 million per year . Then in 1953 General Sarnoff of RCA said everybody would have color TV by the end of the year . Our volume immediately dropped in half . When he opened his mouth , we were devastated . " // Muntz TV was reorganized and the Madman sold out his stock for 75 ? a share , down from $6 . He began looking around for something new and hoi . In the early 1960s he decided the blooming field would be stereo tapes and tape players for automobiles . Muntz helped to develop  --  some say he invented  --  the four-track stereo tape cartridge . Muntz Autostereo built the first 18,000 cartridge players in a plant in California and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year under the name Muntz Stereo-Pak . Muntz organized dealerships and signed contracts with record companies to get music for his tape library . // " With Capitol we had a guarantee to pay them $2.3 million over three years , " he says . " The Beatles were 20% of Capitol 's business and a good part of ours . If the Beatles had a big album , we made money . If they had a cold year , we got hurt . One year when they were in a slump we lost $300,000 . But I was producing 30,000 cartridges every day . I had no competition until about 1969 when everybody and his uncles and cousins jumped in . They started righting and bidding and drove talent costs up so high nobody could do well . " // Besides the competition , two other factors finally forced Muntz out of stereo tape . One was the development of the eight-track tape cartridge by Bill Lear . " I fought the eight-track concept , but Bill Lear got in there and convinced people . He won , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the rising number of music bootleggers. // " Bootleggers are doing over 50% of the business in tape cartridges , " Muntz says . " They save at least $1.25 in royalties on each cartridge . Many of the tapes you see in any auto stereo player are phony labels , bootlegged . Very few four-track tape cartridges are produced legally anymore . " In 1970 Muntz sold his Stereo-Pak outfit and once again pondered what it was America might need that Madman Muntz could offer . // He considered and rejected video tape cartridges , and when nothing else caught his interest sufficiently , the Madman decided to hang up his Napoleon hat , pull down his billboards , surrender his tables at nightclubs and retaurants that were folding faster than he was and do something he had never thought he would do . He decided to retire . // Muntz had begun his working life as an installer of car radios in Elgin , Ill . At the age of 20 he rented a used-car lot for $5 per month , bought 27 automobiles for $330 and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deals for another year . One of his first successes was selling a 1927 Whippet for $15 . He sold the same Chrysler five times to people who could n't make the payments . During the Depression of the 1930s , junk dealers were turning large profits in the car business by selling tires , parts and scrap metal , but Muntz kept at the occupation of selling cars that would run , and by the time he was 21 he had his own Chrysler dealership . Moving to the West Coast with his crack salesman Don Adams , Muntz worked with organizer Ed Lattner and advertising man Mike Shore . They invented the little logo figure , without Napoleon hat , with the slogan NO SEX , NO TRICKS , NO HIGH PRESSURE , but it was not until a radio ad said , " See this automotive madman immediately " that " Madman " Muntz was born . // Other than his merchandising interests and his fondness for tinkering with electrical gadgets , Muntz had also been involved in auto racing during the 1930s , owning three midget racers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sliding slowly into a funk of boredom . " For three months I climbed the walls , " he says . He continued asking himself , What Does America Want from Madman Muntz ? Muntz figured he would go on the road for a while to air out his mind . He borrowed a motor home  --  one of those self-propelled bedroom-kitchens  --  from a friend , actor Wendell Niles , and drove through Northern California and out to Yosemite . On the road Muntz realized he had found the answer . What America wanted was what Muntz was riding around in. // " I fell in love with that motor home , " he says . " It was better to have , cheaper and more fun , than a boat or a plane , both of which I 'd owned . And I saw so many motor homes on the road , I knew there would soon be a lot more . " // Typically , Muntz drove back and bought 76 motor homes of his own . He located a spot on Sepulveda , before the street began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly Madman Muntz discovered he had not , after all , found the answer , though he was at the first step . The answer to What America Really Wanted was not motor homes but motorcycles. // The way Muntz learned the true answer was that when people came in to lease his motor homes a great many of them asked for racks to be installed on the back so they could carry along their bikes . If there were so many who wanted to carry bikes aboard motor homes , the Madman reasoned , how many more must there be who had just as soon take the bikes without bothering with the motor homes ? Enough , he figured , for him to fade out of the motor home business and to buy 535 motorcycles to rent . // It is obvious to anyone who has taken a look around America that there is indeed already a bike boom . Not just motorjock gangs , or kids , or racers , but vast numbers of solid Middle Americans are banging along the roads on Hondas , Yamahas and Harley-Davidsons . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a motorcycle , it happens all the time . But the boom you see today is a gentle breeze compared to the hurricane of motorcycle lust envisioned by Madman Muntz. // " Whatever happens on the West Coast happens on the East Coast later , and this motorcycle thing is really growing fast in California , " says Muntz . " Almost everything in the country starts in the West and moves to the East . You can look for motorcycles all over New York in a couple of years . The big cause of the boom is the Japs "  --  he never calls them Japanese  --  " have finally come out with a motorcycle people will ride . Honda has made the industry , no doubt about it . The black-leather-jacket crowd hurt the image for a while , but whole families are getting into riding motorcycles now . It 's no more dangerous than football or water skiing . I damn near lost a leg water skiing in 1952 , so I know . People like the sporting aspect of motorcycles , the different clubs , races , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riding it someplace . " // The phone rings on Muntz ' desk . " Yes ... ? Well ... hmmmm , " he frowns , lighting another cigarette . " They both broke a leg ... ? Were they our bikes ... ? That 's rougher than a cob , boy . " // On the other end of the line is Muntz ' son Jim , 31 , who manages Biker 's Country , a 500-acre Disneyland for cyclists run by Muntz near Thousand Oaks . Jim was named for race driver Jimmy Snyder , who was killed in a crash in the 1930s . A skin diver , former member of an underwater demolition team in the Navy , a boat racer and enthusiastic water skier , Jim Muntz and a couple of assistants rent out 126 motorcycles to crowds of 500 or more at Biker 's Country . Race days , there may be 5,000 people arriving at the hilly , dusty site some 50 miles north of Los Angeles . // " When you first get a bike , you want to get your family and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the small office at Biker 's Country while motorcycles roar on the paths and racetracks outside . " Then you become the neighborhood 's No. 1 mechanic on Saturdays . Pretty soon your neighbors buy their own bikes , and wives who want to keep their husbands join right in , and the kids learn to ride , and it 's bikes under the tree at Christmas . Used to be , people said you were gutty , or even suicidal , if you rode a bike . Now old ladies ride them ; everybody rides them . " // A significant problem in the motorcycle rental business , though , is the insurance rate . Anyone who tends to be absentminded , for example , is liable to be heading toward a dandy wreck when he rides a motorcycle , which requires concentration , feel and an awareness of what is coming up next . Drunks on motorcycles do n't last long . On the streets there is auto traffic to contend with . Many auto drivers still seem to view motorcycles as a menace to be squashed . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and heavy denim pants by motorcycle riders . The outfit may save a few yards of skin when you are skidding on asphalt . // " Some guys can learn to ride a bike in five minutes , but I think it usually takes about a month of practice at a park like this before you ought to trust yourself out in traffic , " says one of Jim Muntz ' assistants . He is saying this to a visitor who nods vigorously . The visitor has just gone down a hill on a racecourse in a very showy end-over-end style while his bike lay peacefully in the dirt about three-quarters of the way up . " But it 's the greatest sport there is. " // The only thing Madman Muntz can think of that might delay the bike boom is the economy . " We 're hurt bad out here in California , " he says . " It used to be the kids had most of the spendable income , but this past summer the kids could n't get jobs . People out here are n't paying bills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take in as much money this year as I used to spend in a month on advertising Muntz TV. " // He thinks about this for a moment and his face brightens. // " But motorcycles are a hell of a lot cheaper to buy and run than automobiles , " he says , " and if you ca n't afford to buy a motorcycle , we 'll be more than happy to rent you a freeway-legal bike for $8 a day and only 86 a mile , and you can get through traffic jams like that one out there a whole lot easier than you can in a car . In a car you could grow a beard before you got down Sepulveda. " // He grins . On the wall behind him is a sign that says EVEN SANTA CLAUS BELIEVES IN MUNTZ.
