SHERLOCK HOLMES by WILLIAM GILLETTE <P> If Chinese customs prevailed in the West , this might be known as the Year of Sherlock Holmes . He is on the bestseller lists in a novel entitled The Seven-Per-Cent Solution , in which Sigmund Freud allies himself with Holmes , sharing , among other things , a mutual addiction to cocaine . Books about Holmes and his creator Sir Arthur Conan Doyle , already formidable in number , are proliferating with the breeding speed of the fruit fly . One Manhattan bookstore has an entire window display devoted solely to these works . There is only one James Joyce Society , but in the U.S. alone there are four official groups of ardent Sherlock Holmes fanciers . Apparently , the master sleuth defies definition . In a sense he himself is the case that can not be solved , a character about whom speculation never ceases . <P> A visit to Broadway 's Broadhurst Theater , where the 75-year-old American drama has been handsomely restored by England 's Royal Shakespeare Company , proffers at least one clue to the enduring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a seer . He is a master illusionist of the mind , a cerebral magician . He simply does not belong in the ordinary annals of sleuthdom . Even such outstanding detectives as Nero Wolfe , Inspector Maigret and Philo Vance pile up and sift the facts . Holmes notes the evidence with something like X-ray vision and pulverizes it with weary disdain in a sentence or two . His fictional colleagues may be clever ; he is clairvoyant . <P> It may be astonishing to contemplate , but another extraordinary aspect of Holmes is that , along with his violin , he sounds a metaphysical chord . He and Professor Moriarty are Manichaean twins , representing the endless moral struggle between good and evil . <P> Lady in Distress . If any of us lives to see a more perfect embodiment of Sherlock Holmes than that offered by John Wood it will only be by some special dispensation of Thespis . Little known to U.S. theatergoers except for his Guildenstern in Tom Stoppard 's Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead , Wood belongs among the top dozen actors of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ command . He moves with the lithe , menacing grace of a puma . In an instant , he can range from partygoer prankishness to inner desolation . At the core of his being , he is a raging , inviolate perfectionist . <P> The plot ? Does one tattle on Sherlock Holmes ? No . But yes , there is a beauteous lady in distress , purloined papers , low , seedy minicriminals , velvety London fogs , the claustrophobic peril of a sealed gas chamber and Holmes ' agile Houdini-like escape from it . Over everything lurks the brooding presence of Moriarty , played by Philip Locke like a Mephistophelean raven of evil . <P> As director , Frank Dunlop , who has already enhanced the year with the laugh-strewn Scapino , seems incapable of an error in pace , tone , stance or phrasing . He is a meticulous sculptor of actorscape-the distance , closeness , stillness and motion with which players relate to one another onstage . This company is not called the Royal Shakespeare for nothing : to the last man , woman and prop , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
