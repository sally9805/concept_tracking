txt CHESHIRE , Ohio  --  This little Ohio River town , population 315 , hardly seems the place to find signals of a trend that could affect people all over the country . Nothing much happens in Cheshire . The nearest sizable town is Gallipolls , 10 miles away , and not much happens there either . mutt noes lump= III ** IS arm nearly every day , a big tugboat pushes as many as 10 barges full of coal alongside the loading dock of the Ohio Power Company 's huge Gavin plant . There is nothing unusual about using coal around here , of course . It 's abun ? dant in southern Ohio , In Indiana and Illinois to the west , and in Pennsylvania to the east . And just south of the river in West Virginia are billions and billions of tons of the stuff . BUT THAT Is n't where most of this coal comes from . Some comes from the Amax Co.

A team of Tribune writers has found Industry is preparing for that day with a shift of Its own  --  from east to west in the search for coal . This article by Jon Margolis of The Tribune 's Washington Bureau is the first in a series of reports on the western coal barn . Casey filukro , of Gillette , Wyo. ? roughly 1,20 ( 1 miles from Cheshire as the crow flies . Most of the l ? emainder comes from a mine in Carbon County , Utah , 350 miles farther away . Needless to say , the coal does not come as the crow files . It comes by rail Dom the Great Plains to the Mississippi and Ohio rivers . At specially constructed terminals , it is then taken from huge environment editor , and James Coates of the Washington Bureau also have contributed to the series . " unit trains " that never stop and put onto barges , which take it to the edges of Kentucky and West Virginia . It 's the American version of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , From upstate New York to southern Alabama , utility plants in the eastern half of the country are switching from " neighborhood coal , " the Appalachian variety , to fuel from the West . EVERY DAY , hundreds of people , thousands of pounds of machinery , and hundreds of thousands of dollars arc flowing from East to West , simply because of the coal-buying practices of utility companies . The government-owned Tennessee Valley Authority already uses western coal for its plants in western Kentucky and Tennessee , and it is contemplating purchase of western coal for a power plant just 9D miles from West Virginia 's plentiful supply of low-sulfur , high-power oat . Elsewhere in the South , power plants in Alabama and Mississippi are negotiating for western coal . Even in upstate New York , about as far from the northern Great Plains as any other place in the country , the Niagara Mohawk Co. plans to use western coal , And what has happened so far is only the beginning . According to the U.S. Bureau of Mines , " there will be very substantial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next few years , with more than half of the new coal mined between now and 1980 coming from the West . MOREOVER , the actual mining of coal is but the tip of the iceberg . In just five western states , the Bureau of Mines reported , the energy industry is planning to construct 47 new power plants , 21 plants to convert coal to natural gas . and five new rail lines and a like number of slurry pipelines to take the coal out of the region , Taken together , these corporate plans portend a boom in the Western Great Plains ? and a decline in the East similar to the one being caused by the growth of the Southwestern " Sun Belt . " None of this is about to happen overnight . The course of major enterprise runs no more smoothly than that of true love , and some of those big projects will be delayed if they are built at all . STILL . IT Is already apparent that // The great coal switch Western coal boom will it undermine eastern U.S. ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mammoth shovel mine . Coal from the 25-foot-thick Rosebud seam is loads coal in a truck in Western Energy 's Colstrip , Mont. , shipped by Burlington Northern trains to the Midwest . // some of America 's biggest businesses are investing big money in the new coal . boom area and that the old , eastern coal areas are suffering because of It . Nor is the boom an unmixed blessing to the West , where many welcome the riches but others worry about the effects of large-scale strip mining on semi-arid range land and wonder if there is enough water to support both ranching and the proposed energy plants . Even stronger are worries about whether the Influx of people , machines , and money will destroy one of the last agrarian regions of the country , a sparsely settled land of prairies , gullies , and arroyos that is home to what one Montana rancher called " probably the most identifiable American lifestyle , " that of the western cowboy . IF THE PRECISE effects of the Great Coal Switch are not clear , neither are its exact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coal companies are just following good business sense and tile dictates of the market in seeking out coal that is cheap , easy to mine , and clean enough to meet the requirements of anti-pollution laws . By signing one contract with one mining company , a utility can virtually guarantee itself a long-term supply of millions of tons of the low-sulfur coal that is plentiful in the West . Tile coal is in huge seams , 100 feet thick in places , not far below the flat surface . " In some cases , our ratio of overburden to coal is as low as one-to-one , " said C. E. Smith , president of Exxon Co. ' s Carter Mining Co. in Gillette , That means that for every foot of coal seam , the big shovels have to scoop out just one foot of surface dirt and rock . This , of course , makes the coal cheap to buy : as little as $5 a ton at the mine mouth . To get the same amount of coal in Appalachia , a utility would have to negotiate contracts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of coal under much more dirt and in hilly terrain . The cost runs from $15 to $27 a ton . FURTHERMORE , that colon coal Is mined by members of the United Mine Workers of America , whose tendency toward wildcat strikes can interrupt the supply of coal . For tile last several years , the move to bring western coal to the East has also been the policy of both the federal government , and the corporations that control western coal . The coal industry in the West is dominated by the big oil and railroad companies and such giant concerns as the Amax Co. , a subsidiary of American Metals Climax , and Utah International , a subsidiary of General Electric . Many of these companies also mine coal farther east . " But they do n't control it back here , " said John G. Hutchinson , the mayor of Charleston , W. Va. , and a member of the Federal Energy Administration 's coal-advisory board . " We have an awful lot of independents running around here . " UNDER the Nixon and Ford administrations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ western coal through at least four actions : ? It opposed federal laws that would have slightly limited the amount of western coal that could be strip-mined. 46.9 Two such bills were vetoed by President Ford , ' ? The Interior Department proposed leasing out more federally owned western coal lands , even though " the industry ca n't possibly produce one per cent of the 16 billion tons they already have leased , " according to an Interior Department economist . o The TVA , g project that makes the government the country 's biggest coal consumer , turned to tile West for thousands of tons of coal . ? Most Important , the Federal Energy Administration fostered the belief that very little low-sulfur coal remained is the East and that the only way power plants could meet now federal clean-air standards without installing expensive " scrubbers " was by obtaining low-sulfur coal from the West , In its " Project Independence " and " Energy Outlook " reports , the FEA asserted that only coal from the northern Great Plains could meet expected higher demand with coal that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that the impression it has gotten from FEA is much tile same ? that only the %Vest could provide enough low-sulfur coal , " Most of the coal cast of the Mississippi generally has a higher sulfur content , " said W. Denham Crawford , head of the utility industry 's trade group , the Edison Electric Institute , " If there 's much low-sulfur coal in the East , it 's well-hidden . " Crawford is correct that the proportion of low-sulfur coal is higher in the West . But the notion that there is no low-sulfur coal In the East is demonstrably incorrect . According to the Bureau of Mines , almost 33 million tons of economically mineable , low-sulfur coal lies under the hills of Appalachia , most of it in Kentucky and West Virginia . Moreover , the bureau has reduced its figures by considering only coal that lies less than 1,000 feet from the surface in seams at least 28 inches thick , Appalachian coal men say they can economically mine coal that is deeper and in narrower seams . West Virginia officials count 46.9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A 1968 estimate by the Bureau of Mines estimated an additional 32 billion tons in other Appalachian states . ? EVEN THE reduced figures of the Bureau of Mines indicate enough lowsulfur eastern coal to supply all the utility and industrial plants for the rest of this century and beyond , even if the coal industry 's projected consumption rates for 1985 had been reached last year . In addition , the low-sulfur western coal is being used in some plants that are not required to burn it . The Gavin plant at Cheshire , for example , is allowed to burn coal with as much as 414 per cent sulfur , meaning that it could buy coal from an Illinois mine ' just 50 miles from the terminal in Metropolis , where the Wyoming and Utah coal goes onto barges . Much of that western ' coal is mined by subsidiaries of the American Electric Power system , which owns Ohio Power . In a sense , then , the utility company is paying itself for the coal . And in this case , the holding company also owns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rail-to-barge terminal where the coal is transferred , and some of the rail cars that bring it from the West . If prices along this particular supply line go up , the utility can pay its parent corporation more  --  and pass the extra costs along to its consumers . , holdings in the energy giants controlling the western coal mines . For example : Chase Manhattan Bank , in which the Rockefeller family has considerable influence , holds nearly 3 per cent of the stock of American Electric Power Co. , according to a 1974 U. S. Senate . committee report . Chase Manhattan is also generally assumed to hold a large share of Exxon , the Rockefeller-founded company whose mining subsidiary will soon ship coal from Wyoming to American electric plants in Indiana . And the bank holds 6.7 per cent of the stock in Burlington Northern , the biggest shipper of western coal to midwestern barge terminals . WHETHER these patterns influence corporate policy entirely a matter of conjecture . Bank officials insist that those stocks are held in trust and that the bank plays no role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says there are two reasons it buys western coal ? it is low sulfur and it is cheaper , which means that utility services will be cheaper for consumers , too . By the time western coal reaches an eastern plant , however , it may not be cheaper at all , inasmuch as the transportation cost can be higher than the price of the coal . What 's more , not all coal is alike . Some is more potent , and the most potent comes from the East , So the cost per British Thermal Unit ( BTU ? the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit of western coal can be higher even when the cost per ton is lower .
