GERALD STONE and his wife Beth made the long journey from the U.S. to Australia with their two daughters in 1962 , refugees from the nuclear-fallout scare of that year . Born in Columbus , Ohio , Stone , 37 , lived for five years in New York , where he worked for United Press International . As the senior reporter on the Australian Broadcasting Commission 's top television news show , he earns $11,200 a year , which he reckons would be worth twice as much in U.S. terms . <P> " It all seemed so unsophisticated , almost naive , " Stone recalls of Australia nine years ago . " Trucks stopped on highways to let schoolgirls cross the road . The groceries did n't keep paper bags , so you had to bring your own . " There were few Americans in Sydney in those days , he says , " but it was very pro-American . Australians had Hollywood visions of America as a land of big cars , big houses and beautiful people . The American accent had status here . " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in surprise , ' Why would an American come here ? ' " They no longer need ask . " The headlines have done it : the death of the Kennedys and Martin Luther King , the race riots , Viet Nam . " In 1962 , Stone was one of about 200 Americans who arrived in Australia for permanent or long-term residence ; last year the figure was 9,000 . <P> The Stones are about to move into their new , $30,000 four-bedroom home on a gum-tree-shaded site overlooking the middle reach of Sydney harbor . " My last trip to the U.S. showed me for sure that we lead a good life here , " he remarked one morning last week . " In Columbus , " he said , " old friends were afraid to let their kids go downtown to a movie . " At that moment his twelve-year-old daughter Klay was shopping alone in downtown Sydney . " They no longer seemed to know the answers to their problems , " Stone continued . " Once , for every American problem , there was a solution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fear of crime . Who needs that ? " <P> Stone is not altogether satisfied with the quality of Australian schools . On the other hand , he finds Australia a better place to raise his daughters . " Young people grow up here under less pressure of permissiveness , of drugs and pornography . Growing up here in the ' 70s is like growing up in America in the ' 50s. " - <P> Beth , who is taking university courses and working in a psychiatric health center , finds more to criticize . " There 's a Victorian inequality of opportunity for women here , a great waste of women 's resources . Women here do n't seem to think they have the right to speak . Even well-educated women hesitate to enter a dinner-table conversation unless asked . " <P> Her husband does not disagree . " Some of the main problems here are the lack of a viable political opposition , the status of women , and deficiencies in education , " he says . " But things are improving ; Australia is coming into its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adds , " In a word , Australians are healthier than Americans , and less perplexed . "
