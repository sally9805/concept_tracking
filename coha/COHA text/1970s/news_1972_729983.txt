txt A proposed settlement of the crippling national coal strike was accepted early today by leaders of the miners ' union after they had initially ' rejected it . The decision came after a day of tense negotiations . The report by an official Inquiry , issued yesterday morning , came close to meeting the union 's demand for an average wage increase of 25 per cent . After the miners ' leaders insisted they wanted more . Prime Minister Heath abandoned his policy against personal intervention and called the union officials and executives of the National Coal Board to 10 Downing Street late last night . Union Leaders Jubilant The leaders of the National Union of Mineworkers failed in their last-ditch efforts to win their full demands and settled for the substantial increase proposed by the inquiry . They did succeed in gaining what they called " important concessions , " including changes in bonus payments and an extra five days holiday a year . The president of the union , Joe Gormley , emerging with a laughing and joking group of miners ' leaders from 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concessions in the last 29 hours than we have done in the last 20 years . " They will now recommend acceptance of the proposals to their members and urge they cease their picketing . While power cuts will continue for several weeks , the absence of pickets will free coal already mined for use in generators starved of fuel , More coal-fired generators shut down yesterday and blackouts continued for up to nine hours in virtually every home . Officials said the power cuts yesterday were the most extensive so far and warned they would be worse next week . The preoccupation of Mr. Heath with the 41-day strike was underscored by his decision late last night to cancel the visit by President Pompidou of France , scheduled for this weekend . They had planned informal talks about the European Common Market at Chequers , the Prime Minister 's country residence . The official announcement said the Prime Minister told Mr. Pompidou that ' ' it might be more convenient " if the visit were postponed in view of Mr. Heath 's " personal involvement in the discussions " on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being caused by the I strike and urged them to settle in the national interest . Even if the miners endorse their leaders ' acceptance of the terms . Britons will continue to remain in the dark and cold for several weeks , It will take that long for power stations to replenish thei rcoal stocks . Inflation Is Noted Department of Employment officials estimated last night that the number of workers laid off because of the strike had risen by another 100,000 to 1.6 million . Officials said that most of the steel and the motor plants , operating at half-time under Government orders , and thousands of other factories would probably be closed down by the end of next week . In its findings , the court of inquiry said it understood the Government 's worry about inflation , " which presents the most serious threat to the standards of living of everyone including the miners themselves . " But , it went on , the miners are in a class of their own because of the " combination of danger , health hazard , discomfort in working condi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The court accepted union arguments that coal miners , once ahead in pay , had slipped behind workers in manufacturing . It added that the " fall in the ranking of coalmining pay has been quite unwarranted . ' If the National Coal Board can not support the pay terms from its revenue , the court said , then the Government should provide the money . It suggested a 16-month pay package , back . dated to Nov. 1 . If coal prices rose to cover the pay costs , the report said , the market for coal would drop by one-third and miners would be dismissed . If the Government wanted to avoid this , it would have to subsidize the board , the report added . One result of the dispute is likely to be a re-examination of the country 's fuel policy . At present , 75 per cent of Britain 's electricity is generated by coal in a deliberate move to keep mines open and to avoid overdependence on oil . Testimony by Coal Board officials at the inquiry underscored the problem .. , They said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profitable . Assoslatad Prost Miner on picket duty et electrical power station burns wood to keep warm . probably will be completed by Friday or Saturday . If the terms are accepted , the 280,000 miners could return to work by next weekend , and one of the worst industrial crises since World War II would come to an end . The union 's leaders caused alarm yesterday when they voted , reportedly 13 to 12 , to reject the proposals of the three-man inquiry , which was led by Lord Wilberforce . Even union supporters in the House of Commons were surprised . The initial response from the coal fields was mixed , with some miners welcoming the proposals and militants demanding that the union hold out until the claims were met in full . New Demands Expected In any event , it was clear to observers in London today that the miners had scored a notable victory . They receive a wage increase averaging about 20 per cent , which is two-anda  --  half times more than the unofficial ceiling the Government has tried to impose on wage settlements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's anti-inflationary efforts . Government and industrial leaders are now bracing for a rash of high wage demands from millions of workers in the current bargaining season . Apart from the expected economic impact of the settlement , many observers feel that Mr. Heath has also suffered politically from the crisis . His tough stance against the miners , who showed themselves capable of paralyzing the country , is increasingly being regarded as a miscalculation . Many believe the strike could have been averted had the miners been offered even less than their leaders have now succeeded in extracting . The original Coal Board offer ? about $5 a week more  --  was rejected by only a small majority of the coal miners in a vote . The Wilberforce inquiry , finding that the miners deserved " special treatment , " proposed that the basic pay of surface workers be increased by $13 a week to $59.80 and of underground workers by $15.60 to $65 a week . The union leaders went to Downing Street demanding $2.60 more than the proposals for each job . For those workers at the coal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ union demanded . It suggested $11.70 increase , bringing the basic pay of the coal-face workers to $89.70 a week . Union leaders were obviously satisfied with this recommendation . In his meeting at 10 Downing Street with the union leaders . Mr. Heath said his Cabinet had decided against any increase in basic pay beyond the proposals .
