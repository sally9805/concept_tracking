Joe Namath reported in last week at war with the press ( " Everything that 's been written about me is a lie " ) but with a softer message for autograph seekers , who came away with : // At week 's end there was no peace for the Jets , who lost 28-24 to the Giants with no Joe . // Meanwhile , in Milwaukee a small boy was asking Frank Robinson for his autograph , and Robinson told him to get a nearby mountain of a fellow in a goatee to sign , too . " Why ? What does he do ? " said the boy . " He used to play pro football , " was the somewhat inadequate explanation of Rosy Grier 's past . The boy asked Grier to sign up and added , " Would you please write ' football ' above your name so I 'll remember who you are ? " // What if somebody gets that boy to ask Namath the same question he asked Grier ? // Larry Winn Jr. , a candidate for Congress in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help him raise campaign funds by having local Republicans pay to play a round of golf with them . When the group could n't make it Winn decided that one ace might beat five of a kind anyway and hired U.S. Open Champion Tony Jacklin as his feature attraction . Winn charged $125 for the privilege of lunch , one hole of golf and cocktails with Jacklin . Fourteen foursomes , or $7,000 worth , teed off simultaneously , and Jacklin roared around the course in a cart , playing one hole with each group and hitting a tee shot on the next hole for the foursome 's high man . Fifty more people paid $25 apiece simply to watch the performance , eat and drink with Jacklin and see the presentation of such awards as Spiro Agnew watches and a Jack Nicklaus putter to the winners . Obviously a whole new fund-raising technique has opened up for politicians . How about $100 for free throws with Wilt or $1,000 to play the net for Pancho ? // Chicago 's placekicking specialist and free agent with a guitar , Mac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Johnny Cash 's San Quentin . The Bears , it seems , are not having a lot of fun in their Rennselaer , Ind . training camp this summer . As Percival sings it : // " You 've hosted me since ' 63 , I 've seen players come and go , And I 've seen ' em die , and long ago I stopped asking why . Rennselaer , I hate every inch of you , You 've bruised me and you 've scarred me through and through . " // Well , that sounds about right for a team that finished 1-13 last year . // The man meets That Girl ! Wowee ! Or sort of wowee , since in fact Stan ( The Man ) Musial has known Marlo Thomas for years , which is why he will turn up on her ABC network television show this season . The episode has already been filmed , and publicity types are hailing Musial 's masterly portrayal of Stan Musial in a two-parter entitled There Sure Are a Bunch of Cards in St. Louis . " Calm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are saying of his performance . But Musial should have been at ease . The setting was his St. Louis restaurant ( Stan &amp; Biggie 's ) , and the producers had duplicated the decor of the place right down to the last T-bone on an old Paramount lot . The next question is , will the critics call Stan a hit ? // Arthur Allyn , former owner of the White Sox , is a butterfly buff who once went all the way to Paris to buy part of a collection and has bid as much as $12,000 for a single specimen . So he took it pretty hard when he discovered that a collection he recently acquired , which he says was supposed to contain 120,000 butterflies , actually comprised no more than 50,000 specimens , and some of these a little moth-eaten . Bugged at the notion that he might have paid twice too much , Allyn has sued to recoup $16,000 of the $32,000 the insects set him back . // Whatever some people may think , both Abbie Hoffman and Muhammad Ali are appealing  --  their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals how come he 's been refused permission to go to Canada while Abbie Hoffman , of the Chicago 7 , has been given an O.K. to romp off to Cuba . Hoffman said in his request to the court that he had research to do for an article for a Cuban magazine Rebel Youth . Not only was his request granted while Ali 's was turned down , Hoffman 's trip to Cuba will originate in , you guessed it , Canada . // Picking a horse is tough enough , but consider the problem of the Irish ratplayer . At the All Ireland Rat Race Championships held in County Cork the contenders were running in several heats under different names . The winner was a rat called , at that point , Ilsilinzio  --  a fine figure of a rodent , to be sure , but the same rat had been eliminated earlier under the far more promising name of Nijinsky . // President Nixon , fond as always of the sporting reference , explained last week that it was n't so bad that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know in baseball if you bat .500 , that 's better than anybody 's batted since Ty Cobb . So we 're doing better than Ty Cobb on vetoes . " Fair enough , but some Washington Senator is sure to point out that .500 would n't be much of a won-lost mark . ( Or some historian , that Cobb 's best year was .420. )
