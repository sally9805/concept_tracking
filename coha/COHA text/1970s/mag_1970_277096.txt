Few prudent men would walk lightly into a university presidency today , and the presidency of the nation 's most renowned Protestant seminary is no exception . At Manhattan 's Union Theological Seminary , where campus dissensions are exacerbated by increasingly divergent views on the application of the Christian Gospel , the search for a new president has lasted for more than two years . Last week Union 's board finally settled on a personable , activist cleric whose chief credentials are administrative ability and courage : the Rt . Rev. J. ( for John ) Brooke Mosley , 54 , former Episcopal Bishop of Delaware and currently Deputy for Overseas Relations of the Episcopal Church . <P> Mosley will be a distinct departure for Union . Though the seminary was interdenominational from the start , Mosley is the first president who has not come out of a Calvinist tradition . He is not an academic like current President John C. Bennett , a pioneering scholar in modern Christian social ethics . Nor is he likely to emulate the firm-handed rule of another distinguished theologian , Henry Pitney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union to its peak of prestige . <P> Mosley comes from a pastoral background that may be particularly relevant to present-day conditions . One of Union 's problems is how to react to its inner-city environment on the edge of Harlem . Mosley , as a young priest , successfully built up an inner-city parish in Cincinnati . Another growing problem is fundraising , a fact of life that <P> Mosley learned well as a bishop . But the gravest problem at Union is direction : younger faculty and bachelor-of-divinity students want less emphasis on studies , more on involvement in society . Postgraduate students , older faculty and directors want to concentrate on preserving Union 's academic excellence . Whether that gap can be bridged successfully is doubtful , but Mosley seems more than willing to try . " The groups at Union fight hard for what they want , " he says , " and they want contradictory things . But I rather like that sort of process , and I 'm not unused to it .
