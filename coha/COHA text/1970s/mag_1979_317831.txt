There is no person in Washington who understands completely the meaning of $531.6 billion . The arguments last week about Jimmy Carter 's national budget were surrealistic political rituals designed more for personal identity by the combatants than real evaluation of where we are headed . The AFL-CIO 's George Meany stormed that the whole budget was an attack on " average Americans . " Former Health , Education and Welfare Secretary Wilbur Cohen called the small adjustments in Social Security " tragic , unsound . " And by the end of the week , Congress 's Black Caucus had declared the budget " immoral . " Each critic seemed blindfolded , feeling a leg of the elephant and calling it a tree . <P> The sheer immensity of the amount may be partly to blame . Bo Cutter , the man from the Office of Management and Budget who directs the preparation of the budget , has made it a point to remind his staff repeatedly that a million dollars is a lot of money . In the hundreds-of-billions environment , a million dollars can be lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cutter has had his staff calculate some other reminders : a million dollars ' worth of quarters stands almost as high as Mount Everest ; the number of stacked quarters in this year 's budget would extend as far as five round trips to the moon . In dollar bills , the Carter budget would weigh 531,600 tons . <P> No society on earth has ever produced so much wealth and given it to the Government , which then returns most of it in services for its citizens . This year 's budget is greater than the gross national products of all but three of the 159 other nations around the globe ( the three : West Germany , $650 billion ; Japan , $900 billion ; and the Soviet Union , $1.2 trillion ) . Joe Califano , the Secretary of HEW , who is constantly dieting , jogging and going to football games like a lot of other Americans , will manage $199.4 billion , which by itself exceeds the budget of every other organizational entity on the face of the earth with the exception of the U.S. and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world 's gold , never at its peak ( 1942 ) had such wealth in its vaults ( the 445.3 million oz. of gold in Fort Knox in 1942 would be worth a mere $104 billion even at today 's prices ) . <P> Has public money lost its meaning ? Some institutions measure their effectiveness by the amount of tax dollars they can get , not how well they are used . Politicians run on the amounts they get for their districts , not what the dollars do . In the mounting political debate , the billions of dollars become objects moved around on a game board in a contest between parties and ideologies . The people involved seem to worry more about how they play the game than about the national interest .
