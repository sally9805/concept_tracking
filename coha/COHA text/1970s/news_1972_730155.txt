txt Education Some educators are questioning whether media ads like this are really making a Valid point about high school dropouts . Dropouts : Are They Really Better Off In School ? A few years ago a public-service ad on television showed some run ! ners , one of them wearing boots made of lead , lining up for the start of a race . The race they were about to begin symbolized their lives and the less than subtle message was that someone who drops out of high school , like the runner in the leaden boots , bears a lifelong handicap . About 800,000 teen-agers drop out of school each year in the United States . Their reasons vary : They find class work too difficult or boring ; they can not adjust emotionally to the routine ; they must take jobs to help support their families . Whatever the reason , and rightly or wrongly , dropouts usually are tagged as " failures " of some sort . The most prominent handicap of the dropout , in the popular view , is the prospect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market , he often finds doors closed simply because he lacks a diploma . Educators of late have been taking a fresh look at the high school dropout , and serious questions are being raised about the long-time assumption that a youth is worse off for having left school before graduation , There is growing debate , too , over the question of whether the leaving means the youth , and not the school , has failed . Dr. Jerald G. Bachman of the University of Michigan 's Institute for Social Research has made a study of the problem , and he is one educator who thinks that dropping out in itself is " neither good nor bad . " While he does not intend to encourage young people to leave school , he contends that advertisements such as the one with the runner in leaden boots do not make a positive contribution to dealing with the problem . " The premise of such ads , " he asserted in a recent interview , " is based on a bad analysis of data and is largely misleading . " Dr. Bachman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that began when all of them were enrolled in the 10th grade . He contends that troubles that dropouts experience were present or predictable before they left school " and there 's little proof that dropping out makes matters worse . " He found that dropouts often had in common low socio-economic family backgrounds , low scores on tests of academic ability , poor grades and being held back . Furthermore , Dr. Bachman says that the dropout 's lower lifetime earnings  --  generally , though not always , true  --  have more to do with these factors in his background than with his not having completed high school . Therefore , Dr. Bachman disapproves of the antidropout campaign in the media for the following reasons : ? Evidence does not support the implication that if the potential dropout were to remain in school he could be just like his classmates who continue to graduation . ? The antidropout campaign in the media gives dropouts a bad name and encourages employers to make the diploma a requirement when it need not be . o Young people see through such oversimplifications , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dr. Bachman wrote of his findings in the April issue of " Today 's Education , " published by the National Education Association . " What Bachman is saying , in effect , is that some of the youngsters who are not making it in school would do better to drop out and find other channels to adulthood , " Dr. Owen B. Kiernan , the executive director of the National Association of Secondary School Principals , commented recently . " I support this thesis so long as the alternative channels are there , " Dr. Kiernan , the former head of the Massachusetts State Education Department , continued . " But if they just drop out and drift , I do n't believe they would necessarily be any better off . " Examples of the channels or roles are jobs and/or training in the building trades , allied health fields and assorted service industries . The secondary principals group recently commissioned a study on " American Youth in the Mid-70 's . " The proposition that dropping out can possibly be preferable to remaining in school is rejected by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argue that youths do acquire some benefits , however small , from school and that , in the real world , they usually get preference over dropouts in job-hunting . Nor are all observers willing to concede that sometimes dropping out means a failure on the part of the school , not the youngster . However , the blame is being placed on the school more frequently than it used to be . Schools that are interesting , exciting places will not hold onto every student , but some educators think they would help cut the dropout rate . " Changing the educational system is what keeps kids in school , " says Dr. , Hyrum Smith , the head of the antidropout program of the United States Office of Education . " What we have been doing wrong is trying to put everyone through the same rat race , " Dr. Smith told an interviewer , " There is no one answer for every student . We have to try different formulas .
