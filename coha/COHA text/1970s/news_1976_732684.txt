txt Mars has its wetter side . This is the baffling fact which ? scientists studying the water in the Red Planet 's atmosphere from the Viking orbiters have discovered . Although still drier than the driest place on Earth , the Red Planet 's arctic-like atmosphere shows some startling variations in the amount of water it holds . If all the water in the Earth 's atmosphere were suddenly to rain out it would cover the globe to a depth of slightly less than an inch . Doing the same thing on Mars would result in an ice skin an average of 1/500th of an inch thick . In some places the icy coating would be twice that thick while in others virtually absent . These variations hold a special fascination *Please tura to Page 9 From- page 1 *Scientists baffled by wet Mars for the Viking biologists . They feel that the more water there is the better the chances for life . For this reason the site chosen for the second landing ? at Utopia Planitia ? is on the " wet " side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water vapor , one must first visualize the , planet . Pear-shaped , its southern hemisphere bulges out and in the north , from 45 degrees north latitude to the edge of the polar cap , the planet tapers into a slight neck . On top of this sits the north polar cap . The south pole is nestled in a hollow . Now , add a huge bulge ? covering about a sixth of the planet 's visible face ? centered slightly north of the equator . This is the volcanic Tharsis region , capped with four calderas more than 15 miles high . From the western side of this area carve two low-lying strips ( Mediterranean Sea-sized ) : one headed northwest to the pole , called the Arcadian Plain ; the other running west a quarter of the planet before curving north at the Utopia area , where the Viking II lander is scheduled to alight . Only one more feature need be added . Run-. ning due east from the Tharsis region is the grand canyon of Mars , three times as deep as its earthly rival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francisco . At its easterly end are a series of twisting channels which drain northward into the Chryse Basin where the Viking I lander sits . This basin leads into the Acadalian Plain which also runs up to the north pole . Now the stage is set for the water vapor story . First , there is more water vapor in the air over low areas than in high areas at the same latitude , says Dr. C. Barney Farmer , head of the water vapor detection team . But as the Viking detector has scanned north from the equator it has found increasing amounts of water vapor ? as much as a thousand times more than that in the driest of places . In fact , over a dark area , fringing the north pole , presumably ice covered dust , the humidity is 100 percent . " I 'm surprised that it goes so far north , " says Dr. Farmer . He feels this is persuasive evidence that what is left of the shrunken north polar cap is water ice . There has been a long scientific argument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Martian caps . If there is a great deal then the melting of a cap could provide a thick enough atmosphere and enough water to cut some of the channels which have been seen . Totally unexpected is the course which water vapor takes below the north pole . It favors the Arcadia and Utopia Plains while shunning the Acadalia lowlands . " I ca n't explain it , " says Dr. Farmer . Arcadia is the richest in water vapor . Next comes Utopia . Acadalia comes in a poor third with considerably lower amounts of water , according to Viking instruments . " The fears of five years ago , that Mars is scarce in water , are not justified , " the scientist says . For instance , in the middle part of the planet the scientists have seen ground fogs . These develop gradually after sunrise . The scientists think ' they are formed of water ice . Like on earth , the fog tends to accumulate , in low areas . Another peculiarity of Martian water is its daily variations . Only up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water vapor concentration constant . Elsewhere it varies by about 20 percent : low at night , high at midday . Dr. Farmer finds this mystifying because his calculations find that this vapor should boil up into the atmosphere and blow away .
