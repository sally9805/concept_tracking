MCA bids for big bottler <P> Through its recording and Universal film subsidiaries , MCA Inc. has produced some of television 's more violent programs ( Baretta , Kojak ) , some very slick and successful flicks ( The Sting and , above all , Jaws ) and a stack of million-selling gold records , by Elton John and Olivia Newton-John among others . But entertainment alone has not satiated MCA 's voracious appetite for acquisition . It also has pushed into computer services , retail gift stores , publishing ( Putnam ) and finance ( Colorado 's Columbia Savings and Loan ) . Last week MCA decided that all these things would go better with Coke . It offered $30 each for all the common shares of Coca-Cola Bottling Co. of Los Angeles . Total price : $140 million . <P> That was not enough for CCLA managers , who denounced the MCA offer to shareholders as " not being representative of the inherent worth of your company . " Coke-L.A. , they pointed out , is about to wrap up a deal of its own to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CCLA 's marketing turf from Hawaii and the West Coast eastward . Both companies , like about 500 other Coke bottlers , are independent of the monster Coca-Cola Co. of Atlanta , which supplies bottlers for a fee with Coke syrup and rights to the trademark . The bottlers do not have to confine themselves to Coke : CCLA , for example , also bottles Canada Dry and Dr Pepper soft drinks . <P> MCA 's timing especially annoyed CCLA brass : the offer came before Coke-L.A. could release its third-quarter sales and earnings figures . These are usually the year 's fattest because of summer soft-drink consumption . CCLA 's sales last year were $165 million , v. $141 million in 1975 ; earnings rose to $11 million from $9 million . Coke-L.A. even filed suit to stop the takeover bid , charging that it was illegal because MCA began buying shares of CCLA before filing appropriate documents with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission . Trading in CCLA was indeed furious : through the last six trading days , more than 25% of the 4.3 million outstanding shares changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from $22 to $33.50 . Most of the buying came from arbitragers , or professional traders ( TIME , Oct. 17 ) , who scented a bidding war . <P> MCA , which last year earned a $90 million profit on revenues of $803 million , seems determined to make what it sees as a good investment . MCA is loaded with extra cash-$153 million in all-and needs a place to put it . Coke-L.A. shareholders have until the end of this week to decide whether to take MCA 's offer . If they do , the acquisition will move the movie business toward controlling not only what audiences see but what they buy in the lobby . Twentieth Century-Fox has taken over Coca-Cola Bottling Co . Midwest in St. Paul , and General Cinema bottles Pepsi and Seven-Up.
