Gerald Ford urged " giving greater relief to the so-called middle-income taxpayers - those in the earning brackets of $8,000 to $30,000 a year . " <P> Jimmy Carter promised to " shift the burden of taxes to where the Republicans have always protected - on the rich , the big corporations and the special-interest groups . " <P> With salvos like these , the candidates last week battled over the federal income tax . Ford was talking mostly about tax cuts , but Carter was urging re form to make the system more fair , a subject about which politicians usually talk a lot but do as little as possible . <P> First , powerful lobbies attempt to thwart all efforts to get major tax reform through Congress , even though nearly everyone agrees that today 's system bad ly needs a total overhaul . Second , re form makes taxpayers themselves uneasy because they are unwilling to give up the certainty of a deduction in return for only a promise to lower tax rates . In Federal Tax Reform : The Impossible Dream ? , Tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Circumventing this dilemma is a task worthy of a Solomon . " <P> The U.S. income tax code is a labyrinth of 40,000 pages that provide employment for tens of thousands of tax accountants and tax lawyers . More important , the system , which last year raised $120.7 billion from levies on personal incomes , 42.1% of the Government 's revenues , is laced with inequities . <P> By taking advantage of legal tax shelters , some high-income people greatly lower their taxes . Two typical examples : chiefly through investing most of his $151,000 income in Government-assisted housing projects , a St. <P> <P> Louis lawyer reduced his taxable income in 1975 to $29,000 . Because a Los Angeles taxpayer bought 300 head of cattle for $45,000 and borrowed $75,000 from a bank through a cattle-feeding loan program , he will be able to deduct about $55,000 from his projected gross income of $160,000 this year . Other tax shelters include silver options , oil leases , movie financing and sport franchises . These are all chancy businesses , and the tax breaks were set up to encourage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use such shelters , which makes them unfair in the opinion of many tax reformers . On the other hand , most middle-income taxpayers can take advantage of far more significant special considerations . <P> People who own homes-two-thirds of all American families-can deduct the interest they pay on their mortgages , a powerful stimulus for the housing industry . But the mortgage-interest deduction discriminates against renters . It also favors wealthy taxpayers , who frequently have large mortgages . About 25% of the $60 billion in personal income that escapes taxation each year because of deductions , credits and exemptions is kept by people with adjusted gross incomes of $50,000 or more , a group that constitutes only 1% of all taxpayers . Making use of the same laws , corporations avoid paying taxes on about $25 billion of their annual income . <P> Treasury Secretary William Simon last year made the most drastic tax-reform proposal of all . He would " wipe the slate clean of personal tax preferences , special deductions and credits , exclusions from income and the like . " By his reckoning , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with no loss of revenue .
