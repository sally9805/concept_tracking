GORKY Book and Lyrics by STEVE TESICH Music by MEL MARVIN <P> Imagine a somewhat insecure Bertolt Brecht writing a kind of Man of La Mancha about Maxim Gorky , the Russian Revolution and its after math . Add to this some of the folk flavor of Fiddler on the Roof and you get a rough approximation of what a strange and ambitious amalgam is represented by this musical now at Manhattan 's American Place Theater . <P> Playwright Steve Tesich , 33 , has attempted to use one man , Maxim Gorky , as the mirror of a homeland , Russia , undergoing radical social change . But it is more complicated than that . First of all , there are three Gorkys simultaneously onstage , a romantic boy ( John Gallogly ) , an idealistic young man ( Douglas Clark ) and an old and skeptical observer ( Philip Baker Hall ) who is still deeply moved by the plight of the Russian people . <P> Sweet Piety . The three Gorkys form a triptych of commentary upon each other observed at different ages . Without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth thinking about . He says that survival is mandatory and compromise may be its price . Only the living can change a society , never the dead . He indicates , very subtly , that perhaps Russian society can never be changed , even by revolution , since tyranny is the only tradition the Russians know , have , and trust for getting things done . <P> Against this unholy aspect of Russia , Tesich pits the sweet piety of spirit that still resides in its people . This is brought forth in the music and the dances which suggest a community of soul-something that we can recognize in the life patterns of U.S. blacks . <P> The 28-person cast is exemplary . Tesich spent the first 14 years of his life in Titovo Uzice , Yugoslavia , and something certainly stirred his Slavic blood when he wrote this sometimes erratic , sometimes ironic , but always moving musical .
