 | Asprin:Is One Really As Good as Another ? @# Look into most medicine cabinets and you 'll probably find a half-used bottle of aspirin , kept handy for minor ailments . We take aspirin casually , frequently ? and we take it for granted . After all , we think , it 's mild , it 's safe and , whatever the brand , it 's all the same ? is n't it ? But is one aspirin as good as another ? And if it is n't , is price any indication of quality ? Good Housekeeping discovered , in a sampling of more than 100 bottles representing 50 brands and purchased from all areas of the country , that the quality of aspirin does vary . We restricted our survey to plain aspirin , excluding the buffered and compound tablets ( Anacin , Excedrin , etc. ) also available for pain relief . We subjected the samples to a battery of 14 checks in our Institute laboratories , including the chemical tests of the U.S. Pharmacopoeia , which sets the official standards of purity used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspirin content , the percentage of non-aspirin salicylates ( impurities that can irritate the stomach ) and how quickly tablets disintegrate in an apparatus duplicating stomach conditions ( solid fragments lying in the stomach for any length of time also cause irritation ) . Only 68 percent of the aspirin we purchased passed these four chemical tests with flying colors . The most common defect , in 22 percent of the samples , was failure of the tablet to deliver a full 5-grain dose . Even more serious , six percent of the samples contained excessive impurities and two percent disintegrated too slowly . We also found that price was not always an indication of quality . Bayer aspirin , which was among the most expensive , was consistently pure . But the cheapest brand we bought ( 14 cents per 100 tablets on special offer ) also passed all tests , while one of the most expensive ( $1.39 ) did poorly . Prices were generally lower in the West and Southwest than in the East , and yet the overall quality was better . Supermarket brands INSTITUTE/BUREAU/RONALD H.

Rexall aspirin , generally priced above average , was available nationwide and , in seven out of eight samples , also passed all tests . It is not possible to draw firm conclusions about the quality of the regional or local brands tested . for which we obtained only one or two samples However , the large number of defects among all samples indicates buyers do not always receive the quality they expect . THE SIGNS OF SPOILED ASPIRIN While there is no sure way ( unless you 're a chemist ) to check the purity of the aspirin you buy . @# ASPIRIN continued from page 208 here are some sensible tips that you can use to check your home supply for spoilage . ( Caution : If you have young children , be sure the bottle cap is child-resistant . Regular caps are available for some sizes but convenience should not be placed over safety . ) ? Is the aspirin more than a few months old ? Even pure aspirin can lose its goodness once the seal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for heavy users . ? Was the cotton wadding removed from the bottle on first opening ? If left in , it can collect moisture and accelerate spoilage . ? Check for fragments of loose powder , broken or chipped tablets . In our sampling , 20 percent of bottles contained chipped or broken tablets ? which can be indicators of chemical instability . ? A sharp vinegar-like odor , noticeable when you first remove the cap , is a clear sign that the tablets are decomposing into irritating chemicals . ? Another sign of advanced spoilage : gray , mottled patches on the surface . ? Check the speed with which the aspirin disintegrates by dropping two tablets into water in a saucer . If they are still firm to the touch after a minute or two , then the aspirin is below the usual industry quality , even though it may comply with the official Pharmacopoeia standard . USING ASPIRIN SAFELY Aspirin is as strong as any drug , yet very few brands carry adequate directions for use ; indeed , we came across only two ( Bayer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a package insert . It 's absolutely essential to distinguish between the minor uses ? for simple aches and pains , to reduce a mild fever , or for a headache ? from the major requirements of the arthritic who needs repeated heavy doses , prescribed by a physician , to reduce the progress of inflammation in the joints as well as to relieve pain . During pregnancy , aspirin , like all drugs , should be taken only under a physician 's directions . And a pediatrician is the best person to advise on how to adjust dosage for the age and growth of a child . Mistakes could be serious , especially when repeated doses are administered . There are a number of conditions , too , that make self-medication with aspirin inadvisable in any dosage ? stomach distress , ulcer , asthma , bleeding or bloodclotting problems , or if you are taking prescription medicines . Beware of an overdose , if you are already taking other analgesics or salicylates in other drugs ? for example , compound aspirin , cold or hay-fever preparations .

A final tip ? published studies show that plain aspirin taken with a full glass of hot water enters the bloodstream faster than any preparation except effervescent tablets . ? - I Now , for the first time , everything I you need to know in judging the real I value of a piano .. . for the home , studio , I church or school .
