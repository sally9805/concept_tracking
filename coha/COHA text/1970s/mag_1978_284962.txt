The painter Giorgio de Chirico died of a heart attack in Rome last week . He was 90 , and his death removed one of the last connections between our day and the formative years of modern art . Nearly all who created the modernist vocabulary between 1900 and 1930 are dead . Four remain : Marc Chagall , 91 ; Joan Mird , 85 ; Sonia Delaunay , 93 ; and Salvador Dali , 74 . None have produced much work of consequence in recent years ; posterity will not have time for late Chagall or post-1939 Dali . Nevertheless , De Chirico 's career was so uneven as to have been unique . His impact on art would probably have been the same if he had died in 1920 instead of 1978 . He was the epitome of the artist as burnt-out case . <P> Between 1912 and 1920 , De Chirico produced a series of images-his pittura metafisica , or metaphysical painting-that altered the history of modernism . His empty colonnades and squares , populated by statues and shadows , exerted a vast influence on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ren Magritte and Salvador Dali all paid homage to the liberating power of early De Chirico . He seemed to have made the actions of the dreaming mind more accessible , vivid and poignant than any other painter . " If a work of art is to be truly immortal , " he explained , " it must pass quite beyond the limits of the human world , without any sign of common sense or logic . In this way the work will draw nearer to dream and to the mind of a child . " The tilted , exaggerated perspectives of De Chirico 's pre-1920 paintings , their dry meridional light ( he could extract more mystery from the harsh hour of noon than most people could find in midnight ) and their sense of theatrical expectation , like the hush that precedes the raising of the curtain , gave his work a superbly irrational quality . <P> On the stage of De Chirico 's early paintings , two cultures met . One was the " classical " Mediterranean culture that dominated his boyhood memories . Born in Greece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ De Chirico knew it well : the ocher walls of provincial towns , the neglected public gardens , the statuary and antique rubble . On the other hand , modernity was constantly thrusting its emblems into this dream : trains , clocks , surveyors ' instruments , rulers , protractors . From this collision between mythic time and measured time , an extraordinary poignancy arose ; and the best of these early De Chiricos have not dated . <P> Then , around 1922 , he made a complete volte-face . He was only 34 then , and the desire to be an old master seized him ; the modernist experiment was too uncertain , and history , he thought , would condemn it . " I have seen , " he wrote to Andr Breton in 1922 , " yes , I have finally seen , that terrible things are happening today in painting . " Amid hoots of derision from his former surrealist admirers , he marched firmly to the rear guard and took up an irritably defensive stance , maintaining it for the next half-century.     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
