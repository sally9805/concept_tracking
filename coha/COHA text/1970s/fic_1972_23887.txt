INTERSTICES s OMEONF . LE FT THE FREEZER DOOR ajar and the Princes ' hoard is melting . Frost weeps down the orange-juice cans to the wrapped cuts of meat below , then drools through the crack in the door and streams across the basement floor . It passes beneath Lucy Prince 's washing machine , her dryer , the rockers of Mark 's castoff hobbyhorse , then veers at a depression in the floor . It snakes beneath a table on which are stacked dozens of Lucy 's canvases , paintings from the years after Paris , before the hospital . Now it passes through an open door into the TV room , where Esther and Sidney make love , shortly after having been introduced . They knock the eiderdown off Sidney 's bed . When they fish it up , Esther says . " How did this thing get wet ? " And Sidney says , " It must be the storm . " " The heirs to half a million , " says Esther , " and they have a leaky basement .

The storm begins suddenly , just as the party is breaking up . Taylor Prince and wild Marsha , both drunk , put on matching rubber mach toshes ( one belongs to Lucy I and walk thror the rain to Marsha 's house . E STHER THINKS OF SEASONS .

Once she and Lncy had been down I together , exchanging woman talk while L ironed her sons ' clothes . Esther had been sit on this very hide-a-bed . She had been thinld Lucy looks like an angel since she chopped her gold hair short as a boy 's and left the sl tresses on the dining-room table for Taylo find when he came back from class . Esther been thinking : was Taylor really serious is he said his wife was going mad ? Esther een thinking these things when Lucy put down er steam iron and said : " I ca n't stand my firstorn .

Lucy was in the hospital en and Esther had come over to watch a docuentary on the Royal Family at Home . During nommereial , Taylor said : " Do you want to see lw Lucy looks when she 's having her shock ? , atment ? " And he gripped the arms of his air and went rigid , like the electrocution 2nes in films ; his head snapped back and his with went slack . " How horrible , Taylor , " titer said . Later she wrote a poem about it . Sidney turns toward her in his sleep . He sathcs into her hair . She was surprised at the e of him , for such a small and wiry man . He rt her with his lovemaking . " Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Esther over the phone . " I think you 'll like Incy . We taught at the same prep school . He 's Lard guy to know , but in many ways you two much the same . " So Esther went to the uble of washing her hair , even though she I washed it the day before . In what ways are the two of them much the le ? iidney breathes into her hair . Esther imagines self married to him . She knows he has just shed another degree . She knows that Taylor ted him to drive Lucy back from her con --  , scence in Boca Raton . Shc knows he is ty-three with the soft voice of Virginia . He is bably not as smart as she is . Esther pic:s herself the poetess-wife of a headmaster , umscrihed by tweeds and autumn leaves : ering down through eternal fails and tea rs of courteous voices that skim the abysses tly .

She had not finished studying art and being a handsome girl on iwn in Paris . She had not even had a French yet when Taylor flew over at Thanksgiving knocked her up and flew back to his unity . PLEASE SEND MONEY GET RID OF AE-5 OF YOUR VISIT LOVE L. , she cabled . GIFTED RESULTS WILL YOU MARRY ME. he cabled back . Shc got on the train and went to Hamburg . College friends of hers and Taylor 's were in the diplomatic service there  --  they would lend her the money . But Taylor called them first and told them everything . So Lucy arrived in Hamburg to her host 's transmittal of Taylor 's promise of happiness if only she would let things be . The host took her to his home and his wife went to work . Lucy loved Taylor , did n't she ? Lucy did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just yet and put an end to possibilities . Where , persisted the wife , would Lucy ever find another person so intelligent , so exuberant , and , let 's face it , so rich ? Probably nowhere , said Lucy , but nevertheless she would like to have a look around first and see what other qualities there were . The wife went sober , mystical : some things , she warned , arrive in their own mysterious hour , on their own terms and not yours , to be seized or relinquished forever . Lucy listened and drank gallons and imagined the thing in her womb moving . The wife played on this : perhaps Lucy was further along than she realized . It would endanger her health , her youth ; besides , how could she bear not to see how he would turn out , with the two of them being so gifted , so beautiful ? Lucy knew exactly how far along she was and she knew the child would probably be beautiful . At the end of the week she wired Taylor : LAUNDRESS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ninety-six-minute call .

" Listen , baby , buy two of the biggest eiderdowns you can find . They 're fabulous to sleep under . We 'll have one for us and one for him . " Five winters later , Esther and Sidney sleep under one . Upstairs in the children 's room , little Davie sleeps under the other . Mark , who cut short his mother 's career in art and freedom , is allergic to goose feathers . E STHER , WII0 IS SHE ? He thinks of mysterious , costly oils and those grave and suffering women whose names give fragrance to the Old estament , a queen who saves her people from slaughter . His nose buried in her hair , he is only pretending to sleep , wondering about the waywardness of his body that can ravish suffering Jewesses and goodtime girls but goes limp at the sight of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ festive table , candlelit with Lucy 's homecoming , Esther touched him repeatedly in the course of conversation . She was aware of him , playing to him . he knew that , even if Taylor had not taken him aside and said Sidney , she wants you . " She wants you , old man . She said you were inscrutable . " While Lucy was doing the crepes suzette - even better , Taylor said , than before her shock treatments  --  and the guests milled around in swirls of marijuana and rock , Taylor took Sidney aside and said , " You could make that scene if you wanted , man . She wants you if she says you 're inscrutable . " Sidney smiled inscrutably and said nothing . Taylor hooked his arm about Sidney 's neck joyfully . " You are , you are ! " he said . " I 've known you five years , but do I know you ? Does anyone ? " " What is there to know ? " Sidney grinned arid went hack to sit beside the Jewess he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the planes of his face , knowing he is watched . And he thinks of his father , who never finished grammar school . He calls up images of his boyhood , hidden now behind scholarship and inscrutability . Esther nutters her hands , and he sees how the nails are ragged . He feels himself grow big as a giant inside his pants . HE SHERBETS ARE MELTING NOW . Orange , 1 raspberry , and lime slush drips down on the cuts of meat . Taylor is the one who eats sherbet in this household . He likes the brittle sparkle against the backs of his front teeth . He likes to say , " It 's eating snow year-round . " Ile buys gallons of it at a time , now that Lucy can not shop . Taylor loves to shop . Taylor and the boys do the shopping . They make a game of it . Taylor will say to Mark . " Let 's see how many things we can buy with a bird on the front today , " and off they 'll go , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuffing , wild rice , birdseed. room freshener , anything with a bird on the front . Once , horseplaying at economy , they bought one of everything on sale . " This is fun ! " screams Mark . Then , cagily assessing his father , adds : " Why did n't Mommy like doing this ? " " She felt all the labels were getting back at her , " explains Taylor , picking up a box of Arm &; Hammer soda and running after the squealing child , gnashing his teeth , pretending to be a label in pursuit of Lucy . T WO FLOORS ABOVE THE TY ROOM where Esther and Sidney pretend to sleep , Lucy pushes up through light sedation to meet the wild storm . In the next room her children sleep . Taylor is not back from walking Marsha home . Lucy thinks of herself locked away in the remotest chamber of the tallest tower of the most unreachable castle on the highest peak . The storm tears through the trees and accosts the castle . But nothing can get in here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait for the foolish climber : the treacherous rocks , the howling storm , the rain like blades in his eyes , the steep , hopeless , unrewarding distance . In the dark , Lucy hugs her knees . Often , before the breakdown , she would dream of days in some foreign city . Her dreams would bui on one another . She knew the streets of this of she sat in its private gardens , she swore s : would never leave . Then she would wake sobbir Now she thinks of the city . She thinks of I poor ruined Sidney . But she no longer sobs . all seems remote . She is an angel . She is ck and clean . Whatever is , radiates through In colors her . She can be gold with the sun and gr with the storm . She can live in a house with off people and yet live as one alone . She can mana the shopping now . She understands the labs But Taylor prefers she need him .

He lay awake watching her from his o bed . Ile kept the lamp on so he could watch h She did not take her sleeping pill because it v so good to doze and wake , hoping each time catch him gone to sleep , to find herself unab. doned . Under the light his ordinary brown h was gold , like hers . She climbed into his bed a told him it truly did not matter . She said that had seen his love for her under the lamplight a they could he angels together , mingling fr head to foot . T AYLOR IS DRUNK . Rubber mackintoshes fl ping , he and wild Marsha leaf down rainswept street . Illuminations !

Taylor 's boy Mark goes to P sha 's school . During the months when Lucy sick in the hospital , and later in Boca Ra Marsha had been a good listener . On the o side of the graveyard , they will turn into sha 's street and she will expect him to corm He is willing . But at the moment he 's distra by thoughts of Esther and Sidney in his merit together . How many times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 've c discussed it . Relentless , inscrutable Sid Taylor is pretty sure be can get Esther to him about it . Maybe not at first . She will be loyal and silent for a couple of weeks , but then , Taylor knows Esther . She 'll break down and feed the whole thing into her creative meat grinder and what comes out she 'll ask him to read . " Will you come in for a drink ? " says Marsha . " How strange you look . All that rain on your face , " " I am in tiers , " Taylor replies . " There 's enough for everyone . A huge birthday cake , . hat 's me . " He 's back there in that basement , with Esther and Sidney . Oh how he wishes they itould all be like children holding hands in a : ircle , telling and sharing everything , sleeping Ind hugging one another . He has so much , so nuch to give .

Already 111 gone , in this order , are : sherbets , frozen range juices , Lucy 's raspberries and straw.erries put up from last summer before she rent under , all the frozen vegetables in their ardboard boxes , unbaked bread in foil , and ' aylor 's stock of pizzas . Now a shank of lamb sosens itself from the bandage of freezer paper , se whole side of a cow in her separate white ackages , the chicken breasts , the side of ork ... L YING IN THE DARK , her back to Sidney , Esther reviews the critical words and actions . larsha had wanted Sidney too . There had been moment of rivalry between the two women firing dessert when Marsha said , " Sidney , will - es put some Triple Sec in my coffee ?

Daylight will ne : it always does . He could slip out now , tly , pretending to be going to the bathroom stairs , and go to Lucy instead . Pressed against buttocks of the Jewess , he feels it might he , sible to rise and carry it , quick , like a candle Lucy 's room . O H NO , THINKS ESTHER , feeling the sex in him wake . She moves carefully away but his hand arrests her . He makes space for himself somehow . He covers her face with kisses . " Angel ... angel ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . T HE STORM IS OYER . Taylor drops his party clothes to the floor and climbs beneath the covers of the bed next to Lucy 's . A table separates them , piled high with magazines , journals , and whatever paperback on communication or schizophrenia or experimental literature Taylor is reading . Once he told Lucy when she asked about his future that he would not be ashamed to he a student forever . " Baby , you asleep ? " he whispers across the space . Lucy does not answer . Neither does she pretend to breathe as one asleep . After a while , she hears him breathing deeply , so she gets up , wraps her robe around her , and goes barefoot downstairs to clean up the party . W HEN , ESTHER WONDERS , will ? She hears Lucy at the sink , the clatter of dishes , soft bare feet with their Florida tan padding back and forth above her head . Esther wants some coffee , but she does not want to begin the day . Once she gets up , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although she has not loved him , the itinerancy of their night makes her sad . " I 'll be back , " she murmurs , in case he is able to hear , and gets up , searches the floor for her clothes . Her blouse has been touched by the puddle of water beside the bed . She is so sore she can hardly put on her stockings . As she tiptoes toward the stairs to the kitchen , she has an urge to rush back , throw herself across his body , kiss him goodbye . She hears him saying , " That was a test . If you had n't come back you would never have known . I love you , Esther . " T HE TWO WOMEN SIT across the kitchen table from each other , drinking coffee , leafing through different magazines . Davie makes patterns of wet breakfast food on his tray . Lucy says in her bell-clear voice , " I did n't know people still got hi-nosy . " Esther looks across and reads upside down : YOUR GIFTS CAN HELP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depressing , is n't it ? " she feels obliged to say . Lucy does not answer . What does she think of me. spending the night in the basement with their honseguest , wonders Esther . Lucy shows nothing . Those shocks have lowered her IQ , thinks Esther . She turns the page of her magazine and her stomach lurches , for there is a poem by a rival of hers . The poem is called " Afterwards . " It is about the resuming of boundaries after lovemaking . " Would you like to stay for lunch and go with us to take Sidney to the airport ? He leaves at two , " says Lucy tonelessly . Her eyes are so clear , so blue . " Oh God , no , " cries Esther . Then : " I did n't mean it the way it sounded . It 's just that I want to get home and do some work . " They hear Sidney 's steps ascending from the basement . Esther lowers her head into her magazine . Lucy pads to the stove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Hey , Lucy , someone left your freezer open and everything is ruined . " Esther looks up . Why does he look so smug , she thinks . G OD , SHE 'S MADF . HIM SORE . He puts on his socks , his pants , his T-shirt , and the lice-necked cinnamon sweater that Lucy bought him . Then he sees the stream trickling across the cement floor . It leads him into the adjoining room . He switches on the light , sees her washing machine , dryer , a stack of old paintings . He turns one over , dusty . Oh my poor Lucy , let 's get out of here . The stream stops at the corner of the freezer , the door ajar . Sidney looks inside and studies the mess . It was in progress , he thinks , while he and Esther opened their bodies . He is filled with a sudden energy and goes upstairs to tell the others . T HEY ALL THREE TROOP DOWN to survey the disaster . Sidney has not yet looked at Esther @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has reassumed the slouchy appeal that promised so much . Esther wishes the night were not over . " You 'll just have to have another party , " says Sidney , touching Lucy lightly on her brown wrist . " Ca n't refreeze this stuff , you know . Have a party tonight to celebrate my departure . " His laugh is strained . He does n't want to leave , thinks Esther . " Do you want us to help you get rid of this stuff ? " Lucy stands contemplating the ruin in the freezer . It does not seem to upset her . The eyes are blue and toneless , her skin clear . She shuts the freezer . " It will be all right , " she says . " I will throw it all out later . " T AYLOR SOAPS HIMSELF AND SINGS . He has left the shower curtain open so he can look out the window at the beautiful falling leaves . Why does Sidney have to leave today ? " Stay another month , old man , " he 'd said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virginia ? " " I 've stayed too long , " said Sidney , smiling inscrutably . " Well , you have n't , you know , " persisted Tay lor . " Why do n't you go to Europe ? That 's wha I 'd do if I did n't have my classes . " Sidney said " I 'd rather sit on the porch of my father 's hous , and reread Virgil . " Taylor admires Sidney so much , is a little ii love with Sidney . They should all go out to lunch . Taylor vril invite Esther , and then they will all go to th airport . Mark and Davie will love that . He wi explain the planes to them again . What to wear He selects a lime-green oxford-cloth shirt , dar green corduroy trousers , the alligator belt Luc brought him from Boca Raton , and ... this re and royal-blue paisley ascot .

IDNEY DRIVES ESTHER HOME in Taylor 's ca S The storm has blown the leaves from Li trees . Esther asks Sidney what time his pin departs . Two , he says . " Hut there 's a long layovi in New York . I wo n't get home until eight " Eight , " repeats Esther . Then she adds , " Tho in-betweens are hell . " They are silent . Sidra drives fast . Esther asks , " Are you one of tho . Southerners who hates black people ? " Sidn ( answers , " Are you one of those Northerners wl thinks Southerners hate black people ? " Thl both laugh .

" Go ( bye , " she says . " Hope to see you again , " he sa his courtesy topping hers . She waves and goes the leaf-strewn walk . By the time she reaches I dour , he has turned the car and is off . Estl goes inside . Her cat comes and rubs up agai her . She goes to the kitchen and opens a tin sardines and shakes some hard food into ' bowl . She changes his water .

He will drop by Esther 's place tonight , and maybe stop by and see Marsha too . A drink at Marsha 's just to show he 's no hit-and-runner , then over to Esther 's , popping an allergy pill on the way . Settle into her comfortable sofa and say , " Hey , guess who was beside himself to take down your address ? " " Can we stay and watch the planes , Mommy ? " Mark asks from the back seat . The car radio is on , and a warm , lively melody fills the ear . It has turned out to be a beautiful clear day . " If you want to , honey , " says Lucy , who sits beside Taylor , Davie curled into her lap . Flow serene she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All those clouds gone now . Taylor thinks she is even prettier than before . What , he wonders , could she be thinking , to make such a smile ? It is between him and his mother . She tells it to him every day , like a story . He must never tell the others , not his Daddy or Davie . It would hurt them , she said . The secret is : she loves him more than anything in the whole , whole world . So much that it made her sick . So much that she had to pretend not to , because it would make the others feel bad . That is why she used to act funny sometimes , pushed him that time beneath the water . But he knows better . She loves him . she said , more than life itself , which he does not understand exactly , but he feels the force of it The day she came home from Boca Raton , she took hint by the shoulders and her eyes were very blue . " You saved me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " I must try and look at it like that from now on .

But how can there be two of her , one to save her from the other ? Mark squints into the sun and thinks . Then forgets the problem ii his happiness . She has said they can watch th. planes and Sidney the man is going and the-can have their TV back again because he won ' be down there in the bed . C AN WE STAY and watch the planes , Mommy ? She knows Sidney is in the back seat , he son on one side , Sidney 's suitcase on the other He is sorry to leave . He is frightened of what h is going to .
