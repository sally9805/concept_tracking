a story by Joseph Papaleo THE WORD TO GO for Lydia T HIS HERE BELONGED TO momma . She had it made right after she was married . By Mr. Nardone , who had the store on White Plains Road . Across from the precinct . You remember the old man . Some of you . He was a wonderful carver . Look at the claws on the table legs . That 's his work . I ca n't believe none of you wants it ? " Millie was talking too fast , talking to her relatives , trying to talk them into what they should be grabbing for  --  the special furniture pieces of their mother and father , from the house in the Bronx where they had gone to live forever in ' 31 , but all of it shipped to Westchester after the death of Mr. DiMarco when the change started in the neighborhood . It was as if the death of the fathers , one by one , allowed the small corner lots to be sold to apartment-house builders and then city projects , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come moving in . These were the people who went to Immediato 's pork store , his window flashing with fresh , just-made sausage , and asked for ham hocks and cuts he never heard of . No one wanted the double bed with headboard and footboard in shining inlaid wood or the chifforobe with carved doors or the two long tables with ivory in the tops . It was stuff that did n't go in White Plains . Millie understood this , but she could not leave the country knowing the pieces would be thrown out . " I just ca n't give it to the Salvation Army , " she said again and again . " And you ca n't even find handmade stuff like this today . They 're getting big prices for it . " Millie was continually seeing the pieces exposed somewhere on a street , in a store window covered with filth , or destroyed , just as she thought of her parents ' graves in Good Shepherd , unattended because she was leaving for good . And most of them kept saying she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And her friends said , Oh do n't worry , you 'll be back in a year . But how , if they sold the house ? Mario would have social security and what they had saved , plus the cost of the house . They were signed up for a place outside Padova , but Millie had nightly dreams of floating in the air and calling and nobody around on the ground to help bring her down . As long as she floated she swelled up , and once sh got too big she would explode and die . At sixty five , the dream of dying was worse than ever . That 's why she was talking like a salesman " None of this is Ludwig Baumann stuff , " she said as if angry . " All that Hundred-Forty-ninth Stree crap we got sold and threw away when we move , up here . This is handmade stuff , and even th Protestants know how expensive it is . I bet Larr could tell you . God rest his soul . " The memory stopped Millie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty-three from heart attack , his wife living out in Huntingto with two sisters , only heard from at Christmas wit a card and a few snapshots . What could sh use the furniture for , three old widows in a house packed to the walls with their own stuff When Millie visited them she saw that they ha almost everything in triplicate : couches and tablt the rooms seemed to be giving birth to tables-and three TVs , three toasters , broilers , electr fans  --  like a store . Jack 's wife Emma felt the mention of Lan connected to her own feelings of loss for Jack , hi husband , and the second brother to go . Emu knew that Jack would have taken some of ti pieces : he had so loved them and everything abira the old Bronx house , always remembering tho : sweet , peaceful days , summers when he stain ( and waxed that furniture . But Emma hail sold hi house , too , and was living with her dauglit Noreen and family , in an upstairs apartment wi hills of stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that nobody wanted to buy ; sl understood Millie now . " Throw it all away . The hell with it ! " It w Billy . Billy was really disgusting . Emma look ' across at him as if he were somebody 's waste . " Why ? " Emma said to him . " Do n't you this they 're worth it . Your mother 's stuff ? " Billy looked at her , in shock for a moment h cause she did not speak this way . But she was widow now and had to speak for herself . " Emma he said . " I know it 's good stuff . Bat if it 's ; anchor , if it 's going to stop them from leavir then Millie wo n't go because of some damn wood " So maybe something is saying she should , go ? " Emma said . " Did you ever think of that ? That maybe she does n't want to leave her own people . Did your crazy head ever tell you that ? " Emma 's face was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breathing . They all knew she had become very nervous since Jack 's death , because he was too young , the shock was too great , though Jack had weighed two eighty-five and smoked three packs of Camels a day . But Billy always got her . Jack had told her years ago that Billy was a Socialist , the one brother who went to CCNY where they come back Commies . " It 's up to her , " Billy said . " I agree with you . But l 'm only talking about not making these things stop her life . " " Her life , her life . A couple more visits you could make up here and see her life and how it is . " Emma had surfaced again , spoken , then lowered her head . ILLIE WATCHED HER BROTHER carefully ; Billy l VI had been born when she was fifteen and had been like her own child . She had kept him in her room when Momma was shopping or cooking . And now he stood in the center of the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around his eyes . She could not take it ; his was the one aging face that shocked her , as if what time did to the others was understandable . But not in Billy , who had become an old man in a week . His baldness had happened like the rest , a short time after coming back from the war . Momma had blamed the hair loss on the steel helmets pressing on the hair muscles , but Millie had heard the stories of the islands where they burned out Japs from caves and sat smelling burning flesh for weeks and then even found their own men chopped up like pigs . She could never think of bamboo without getting sick , as if knives were going through her . " I 'm not going to change my mind now , " she said as quietly as possible , to avoid hurting Emma by seeming to side with Billy . " But me and Mario , we talked about this for over a year . Over and over . It was n't no easy thing . " Emma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by feeling the slow depression that came over her these days . She could n't shop when it happened , could n't watch TV , could n't talk to people for more than a few minutes without feeling like throwing up . She was living on Donnatal and Stelazine . It was coming on and she was turning pale , feeling the expectation of something , as if she would begin to shrink . Her daughter Noreen moved close to her , recognizing the mood , and held her hand . Late afternoon light began to hit the room and the furniture turned red . It was the rich , steady light of dusk , so transient but looking like it could stay forever . Noreen loved Millie , who had no children because of a late marriage , and had named her first daughter for Millie . Noreen had asked her husband about the furniture , but he had explained it was perfect stuff for a country house , if they could only afford one . Noreen looked up at Millie , sensing that she was going to speak , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Look , we all know what it is here now . I mean , why not get out of here ? We do n't breathe anymore . We live inside chimneys . The streets of Manhattan , the East Side , no less . You ca n't walk without getting attacked . Dope addicts own the sidewalks . Mario calls it the city of dogs . The streets are just filth , people with dogs doing their ditty all over the whole place . When he makes a delivery of plants  --  you ca n't believe it . Did you know they ca n't grow lichens down there anymore . That 's right . In those penthouse gardens . Lichens ca n't exist anymore in that city . " Noreen was nodding . " Maybe you and Mario should buy a country place . Like New Hampshire . We could all chip in and maybe run a hotel up there . " " Oh we saw it up there , " Millie said . " And how about the food all frozen and cotton bread and one TV channel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . People who do n't talk to each other . And you think they want us . " Millie looked at the room again . " Mario wants to rest . And with his own people around . The family is so nice there . We do n't feel strange there . Remember , I got a pretty dark complexion . " Billy laughed , but not the others , who did not like such comparisons and never thought of them . " Get out , " Billy said . " I do n't blame anybody for getting out right now . We 're a country of bomb throwers . Jailers . We 're going to start putting everybody away . Because everybody you do n't like is a Chinese Commie . " Millie did not like this kind of talk , even in joking . Billy was always knocking the country , but he had never lived anywhere else , nor even traveled to see what she had seen last summer , the police department making everybody register . Mario 's people had to keep identity cards . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brothers and sisters and cousins , always seeing each other , always making little trips , picnics up in the mountains and fresh fish from the rivers . There had never been the loneliness of White Plains , people too busy to see each other , the cold weather locking them all in , and hopeless for anyone who had never learned to drive , like herself . " Do n't look at me like that , " Billy was saying . " You all see the head-breaking in the streets . Kids getting shot . The big shots letting us die in our poisoned air . Some say twenty years and New York will have only poison air . We 'll all be dead . " Millie believed some of this . Mario , who had spent most of his life in Italy , saw it too but accepted without comment . He did not attack America ; it was only a dirty factory to him , where one came to earn money . And now his head was full of the days they would have , the geese and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and wine as fresh as running brook water , Valpolicella , and animals that had grown up eating food and whose meat was not a chemical factory . And market days , the inviting mountains ready in all seasons , and Venice nearby , and Cortina , the white paradise . Because of this , America was never an evil vision to Mario as it was to Billy ) . It was only the land of locked-in people nibbling bad food and unaware that loneliness was not a perpetual state . " Well , we just ca n't take it anymore , " she said to take away the rage the others were feeling toward Billy . " Mario has worked day and night here , and we ca n't keep money in the bank . You have to buy something even when you do n't have to buy . if you know what I mean . Shopping here is like day and night  --  there 's just two of us , but I 'm shopping all the time . Most of my mail is a 0 list of specials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robbed again . That makes three times . Oh you all know about all this . We just want a place we can go in peace . " NTOREEN WANTED TO PREVENT arguments , too . She saw her mother and Billy , both near blowup state , and wanted to make it calm . " I hope you find it nice . With the relatives and all that . Anyway , you can always come back if it got bad . " " That 's what 1 told Mario . And he laughed . " " Sure , " Billy said . " Come back to Bond bread and muggings and gas poison . " He was going again . " And a new war every day . And your tax going for more boom boom . Let me tell you , if Millie gets even one year of happiness over there , it 's worth it . " " Oh yeah , " Emma said . " We 'll all be dead . Where did you hear that one , big expert ? I suppose they 're going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his daughter choke . Yeah sure , I can almost believe it . " " He 's not going to stop the cars , the planes , the factories . The President is there to protect all the profits . He 's not going to stop anything . And the cops get sent out to chase bookies while the gas company is our hero- The airplane makers add a few billion to their bill . The oil company does n't even pay a tax . They got laws from payoffs to the men in Washington . And do you read how nice those cars are we buy  --  like they forget to tie the brakes on . " " Oh . he knows everything . " Emma turned to the others , but they were not excited enough , and she sensed it . " What is this man ? Our God ? That be knows everything . And how long before I 'm going to choke to death ? Oh , come on . " " I do n't make it up , " Billy said . " I read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy for a dime . You do n't even know that they 're yelling , that people get silenced . Thank God , we 're Italians . We do n't yell about nothing . We swallow all the bullshit they hand out from upstairs . Love it or leave it . We wave the flag . We stick it on our cars . And that means , if you do n't shut up , we 'll kill you . " Millie could see that the afternoon was breaking up . The others were beginning to move about , fidgeting with their coats and purses . Noreen got up to straighten her dress and went into the kitchen for v , - ater . Emma began to put on lipstick , and her son , Marty , who had been quiet on the couch , sat forward with the wish to punch his uncle , who disturbed everyone with his screams . Billy saw them turning away from him and became more excited . " They all came over here to had something good . " He turned to them one by one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And now it 's gone bad . Do n't you see it ? Do n't tell me you do n't sit in your chairs expecting the end . You 're just as scared as me , even if you do n't know why . Maybe you sit too long in front of Johnny Carson . You spend more time with Johnny than going to Sunday Mass . Two hours a day for Johnny , an hour a week for Jesus . Your eyes are full of shit . You never walk anymore . You go for vacation and lock yourself in a hotel in the mountains that 's your own bedroom on a mountain . " " Please , Uncle , there 's women here . " Marty had stood up straight , to remind his uncle of the language . Billy looked at him , trying to understand . He would not willingly insult women . " What is it ? " " What you 're saying . " " What did I do ? " Billy 's face was almost wild , a confusing series of old shocks fusing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they trying to silence him ? Had he said something he had not hoard himself ? " I 'm not crazy , Marty , " he said . " Your generation knows what 's happening . What kind of future have they left you ? " Marty did not answer ; he had been working for nine months with a computer company and they had already told him about benefits he had not dreamed about . The company had just offered him two weeks at their own country club . Billy turned to his wife and stared at her ; she understood the shocked face , the despair of being hated when he spoke with love for people and hate for the cruelty inflicted upon them . And when he sensed that people were moving away from him , he began to feel the weight of blame , as if he had done something wrong . He no longer could speak and stared at his wife . The others began to leave , went to the hall closet or the kitchen , moved through Millie 's rug-covered rooms getting prepared and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went and held his hand . " Let 's go , " she said , and Billy began again . " Wait . Just let inc tell Millie . Millie ! " He walked after his sister and found her in the kitchen . " Millie . I 'll take all the pieces . Whatever you want to leave . " She looked at his sad face and almost turned away . " All right , Billy . Thanks . Thanks a lot . We 'll talk about it . Talk it over with Joan . " " Joan understands . We 'll find a good place for it . I got stuff I wanted to throw away . And I 'll pay you . You can use the money over there . And get things for your new place . " " This is not for money . It 's all our property . I just want it safe . In a place it can stay . " Joan came in with Billy 's coat and together they said goodbye and went to the car on the quiet street . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concentration of the driving chasing off his hysteria . N THE EXPRESSWAY HE STARTED talking again , VI out of his thoughts . " I wish I could just turn the car around and drive someplace . Way far away . " " It 's the winters that get you , " Joan said . " The winters . Joan . It is the end , you know . When I think of Millie going back , it 's like the end of the whole thing . No one would dream of going back . Italy was only like a playland in the heads of our mothers and fathers . " " But he 's a special case . " Joan turned to face him . " Mario has family over there , as you know . And that 's a different thing . " " The best way is do n't consider it at all . Sure . Just like the rest of them . But I 'm telling you something . We moved into emptiness and it 's inside us now . I just want to get away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You ca n't get a job there . And nobody I heard of ever ran hack there . " " But Millie 's going back . " " Yes , I know she 's going back . And I know she 's got no kids , And she gets social security . And they got relatives waiting . Mario 's father has a business . " Billy nodded and was silent . Then he said , " A business . I got people come into my store who left Hungary with nothing . They made it . They 're okay right now . " " People are coming here , " Joan said . " There 's all that Communism over there . You have to admit that . People run away all the time . Cuba . Every-place . " " Do n't give me that Commie crap . That 's what they give me when I say anything . If I say we got more generals than garbage men . That do I care about Communism ? They are n't killing me . It all reminds me of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priest , and you tell him , do n't drink that , it 's poison . And he says to you , you do n't want me to insult the Church , do you ? " Joan grappled with the illustration ; there was something wrong with it , but her mind was obscured by her irritation at Billy 's insults . " How could you ever live in Italy if you talk like that . They 'd arrest you in a day . " " Arrest me ? " Billy was getting an echo of the heavy feelings , as if he had done bad things . " Yes , Billy . It 's a Catholic country over there . " Joan paused . " There 's only one country like this where you can speak what you want . " " I speak all the time and nobody even stays in the same room . " Billy felt he might cry ; then the mood turned to anger . " Anything you tell people that cuts into profit is bad bad bad . If they should lose a buck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but do n't touch my car . Oh , I do n't care . I just do n't give a shit ! " Joan turned quickly to his cracking voice . " So the end comes , Joan . The road goes one way and then the road goes back . " " And you are telling me you want to go there , too . You really want us to go . " " If I had something left inside . Maybe I could get out . But that store has a lock on me . A fortyfive-year-old man is a pail full of payments . And that 's the way it is . " He was silent for a while as he drove along . Then he put his right hand in Joan 's lap and drove with one hand . " Maybe I could swing it , " he said , " if I did n't get so mixed up . My head 's got furniture inside . " Joan did not answer and held his hand and let his mind rest as they drove the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and empty in night . The lights of the Caff ? Puglie were lit , and two men on the sidewalk were looking up at the sky while they talked . Billy parked the car and locked it while Joan waited . The lights in the front rooms were lit as they walked to the porch . Billy turned around to look at the sky . " Joan . Look . There 's a moon corn ? ing up over the church . " She stepped back and looked up as the moon . light grew strong and the clouds separated . After a few minutes the cold drove them inside . Joar went upstairs while Billy paced through the house unable to do anything or find his thoughts . Finally he phoned Millie . " Mario came in a minute ago , ' she said . " And he thanks you . He could n't sei shipping all that stuff over there . " " Then you 're set , " Billy said . " You can go . " " There 's so much to do . How can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 'll have to wai till he sells the business and he can make som decisions with me . " " Just take one day at a time ? " " And suppose I want to come back , Billy . An what if we could n't . And they took our either ship . " " Stop talking like that . You 're not going int the jungles . " " Why does it have to fall apart here , now ? Millie was talking to herself , " It did n't used to b like this . What happened ? " " Maybe it was always falling apart , " Billy sai ( " I never heard of a time when the world caul end in two days . Really , you have to be a monstE to exist here today . Mario says , in private , is n't strong enough to live here . He 's got to hal some peace . And he 's the only husband I got . " " That 's right , " Billy said . " So we got to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just keep remembering how nice was over there . I take out the pictures we to ( last summer every night now . And remember tl times we had . And that keeps me going a whil I just have to believe it 's real , over there . And n forget how good it was . Then I 'll make it . "
