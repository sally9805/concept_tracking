Will President Ford 's budget help the recovery ? Or slow it ? Or something in between ? The nation 's leading economists , who failed as a group to predict the nature of the recession or anticipate its depth , immediately-and predictably-differed on the answers . <P> There was a consensus among the economists , however , that whatever is done about the budget will have little effect on the recovery this year . There was also general agreement with Ford 's estimate that real output will expand about 6.2% this year , compared to a 2% dip last year . But the economists are worried-and sharply at odds with one another-about the impact of the budget and its $43 billion deficit ( down from $76 billion in fiscal 1976 ) in 1977 and beyond . <P> Joseph Pechman , a member of TIME 's Board of Economists who is on leave from the Brookings Institution , accepts the need for some tightfistedness but thinks that Ford 's budget goes much too far . Says he : " It 's terrible . I do n't think the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change too early . I just do n't think we should turn around so fast . " Pechman also criticizes Ford 's proposal to allow individuals to defer paying taxes on funds invested in certain stock plans . The economist argues that the idea- " an outrage " - would not increase investment and would do little for people making under $15,000 . <P> Arthur Okun , also a member of TIME 's Board and a senior fellow at Brookings , feels that the economy should be restrained somewhat , but not nearly as drastically as Ford recommends . Okun 's prescription : either scrap the $394.2 billion ceiling , allow spending to rise to $407 billion or so and keep the proposed $10 billion tax cut ; or drop the tax cut and let spending increase to around $417 billion . <P> In any event , Okun opposes Ford 's proposal to raise Social Security taxes on the grounds that it is " regressive , " meaning that proportionately the increase would hit low-income earners more severely than the well paid . The liberals also fault the President for wanting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ families with children to deduct as much as $400 from their income taxes . <P> Critical Point . The more conservative economists on TIME 's Board feel Ford is just about on target . " I feel comfortable about the move , " says Murray Weidenbaum of Washington University . Argues Beryl Sprinkel of Chicago 's Harris Trust &; Savings Bank : " We are devoting 40% of our national income to Government , and that 's too high . High spending means high taxes , and that means less left for the private sector . " <P> Helping the private sector is one of President Ford 's primary aims . " We are at a critical point in our history , " says the President , " a point where we can either allow federal spending and federal deficits to mushroom , or we can decide to restrain the growth of federal spending and restore the vitality of our private economy .
