" Ecology ? " scoffs a black militant in Chicago . " I do n't give a good goddam about ecology ! " In Georgia , Union Camp Corporation 's director of air and water resources , Glenn Kimble , wonders whether mankind will suffer " a whole hell of a lot if the whooping crane does n't quite make it . " Flowery-hatted ladies from the D.A.R . have served notice that concern over pollution " is being distorted and exaggerated by emotional declarations and by intensive propaganda . " Such backlash views are now being voiced in many parts of the country , although the protesters often have little more in common than the smoggy air they breathe . <P> Fancy or Fad . To some critics , the environmental movement resembles a children 's crusade of opportunistic politicians , zealous Ivy Leaguers , longhaired ecoactivists and scientists who speak too sweepingly and too gloomily . The D.A.R . labels the movement " one of the subversive element 's last steps . " Members of that element , the ladies add , have " gone after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going after our parks and playgrounds . " In the same vein , several newspapers from Alabama to Alaska solemnly stressed the happenstance that Earth Day ( April 22 ) fell on Lenin 's birthday . <P> The Red-plot notion hardly impresses serious critics like University of Chicago Economist Milton Friedman . Instead , they view the environmental movement as a mere fad that will soon vanish , like the War on Poverty . Friedman also decries the tendency of some crusaders to cast big industrial corporations* as " evil devils who are deliberately polluting the air . " He argues that the real source of most pollution is the consumer . <P> Both the leftist Progressive Labor Party and Conservative Columnist William F. Buckley Jr . see the movement as a diversion from more important national priorities . Joining them in this view are many antiwar students who feel that peace far outranks pollution as a protest goal . S.D.S. chapters on many campuses have also publicly embraced anti-ecology because President Nixon is publicly pro-ecology . <P> Blacks generally are the most vocal opponents of all . Cleveland Mayor Carl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the poor should take precedence over finding ways to combat air and water pollution . Says Richard Hatcher , black mayor of Gary , Ind. : " The nation 's concern with environment has done what George Wallace was unable to do : distract the nation from the human problems of black and brown Americans . " <P> Other protests are bound to come as industries start to fight pollution . In many cases , marginal operations might indeed be forced out of business when they have to take on the added burden of pollution safeguards . Armco Steel Corp. , for example , closed eight old open-hearth furnaces in Houston rather than equip them with costly antipollution devices . This kind of shutdown can cause economic havoc . Some cases : <P> &gt; U.S. Steel Corp . has threatened to close all its plants in Duluth rather than spend $8,000,000 for pollution controls required by the state . A shutdown , city fathers fear , would throw 2,500 people out of work and severely damage the city 's economy .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
