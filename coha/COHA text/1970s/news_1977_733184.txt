txt WASHINGTON  --  President Carter sold Thursday that he sees " no reason to reevaluate " his plans to withdraw troops from Korea after three United States Army helicopter crewmen were killed and one wounded and captured Wednesday in North Korean territory . In the South Korean capital of Seoul , tho United Nations Command announced that it has agreed to a North Korean proposal that the Military Armistice Commission meet Saturday 9 p.m . Friday , Chicago time to discuss the shooting down of the helicopter . The command had urged the meeting be held Thursday night or Friday afternoon Korean time , but the North Koreans refused . U.S. REAR ADM . Warren C. Denim Jr. , a senior commission member on the U.N . side , sent the following message to North Korea Friday morning : " Despite the fact that your side has again refused to hold the 385th Military Armistice Commission meeting at a time proposed , our side agrees to your . counterproposal ... " Since the actions of your side have resulted In a two-day postponement , our side also requests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " We are trying to let them know that we realize the mistake was made by the crew in going into the demilitarized zone , " Carter told a group of U.S. senators at a routine congressional breakfast . " Our primary interest Is In having the incident not escalate into a confrontation and also to account for the crew members . " The President and his press secretary , Jody Powell , said the Chinook helicopter was unarmed when it strayed about 2 , , z miles into North Korean territory around 9:20 p.m . Wednesday night Chicago time . CARTER SAID the South Korean troops in the area , apparently realizing that the North Koreans have orders to shoot  --  anything going into their territory , fired at least one warning shot . Two South Korean guard posts and one South Korean observation post reported firing warning shots at the helicopter to alert it that it was about to stray into North Korean territory , the Pentagon said . And although there are conflicting reports about what happened in the next few minutes , Powell said the chopper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North Koreans approached the helicopter , the crew apparently tried // Copter attack wo n't bar Korea pullout  --  Carter // to take off again , Powell said , and at that point it was apparently shot down by North Koreans , resulting in the deaths of two crew members . In a broadcast monitored in Hong Kong , North Kama said Friday it shot down the craft because its crew attempted to flee when grounded . The Korean Central News Agency said , " The unhappy incident entirely resulted from the errors of the military personnel of the U.S. side . " It said that the helicoptein landed after warning fire from North Korean forces , but the helicopter then took off and " our side was compelled to fire again . " IN ADDITION TO the two fatalities , a third crewman was killed after the chopper crashed , according to several reports , and the fourth was wounded and captured . The Pentagon notified the next of kin of those aboard the aircraft , but a spokesman said it was not known which of the four was captured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Chief Warrant Officer Joseph A. Miles , 26 , of Washington , Ind. , and CWO Glenn M. Schwanke , 28 , of Spring Green , Wis.  --  the Defense Department confirmed early Friday . The other two crewmen were identified by the ' department as Sgt. Robert C. Haynes , 29 , of Anniston , Ala. , and Sgt. Ron Wells , 22 , of El Paso , Tex . POWELL SAID THE North Korean officials have said the wounded crewman Is receiving medical treatment . The United Nations Command in the area informed the White House that neither the helicopter nor the crew members were armed , Powell said . The helicopter had left from Camp Humphreys , about 35 miles south of Seoul . It was scheduled to stop at a landing zone near the 21/2-mile-wide DMZ . Carter and Powell do not deny that the helicopter was in the North Korean portion of the demilitarized zone , but Powell said the craft was on a support mission supplyink materials ? probably cement  --  to South Koreans . TILE CEMENT was reportedly for a United Nations Command @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DMZ . V White House officials , apparently realizing this would be considered the first diplomatic crisis of Carter 's presidency , were careful to portray the encounter as a border incident and not an emergency . Carter said there is no firm indication so far why the crew veered into the DMZ . The President at one point surmised that they had lost their navigational fix In the mountainous terrain . But he added later : " We do n't know , obviously , what the attitude of the crew was , what their problem was . " LAST SUMMER , the ax murders of two American officers by North Koreans in a quarrel over a tree at Panmunjom drew new attention to America 's 33,000-troop presence in Korea . The entire U.S. ground force was placed on a precautionary alert , and the aircraft carrier Midway and a force of five supporting ships was sent from Japan to Korean waters . Although there was no American refellation for the ax killings , American and South Korean soldiers cut down the tree in the demilitarized zone that had set off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought North Korea was moving toward a softer stance in relations with its non-Communist neighbor . ON CAPITOL Hill , Gen. George Brown , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , testified before the House Armed Services committee and said the incident had not caused the joint chiefs to re-evaluate their support of Carter 's position on the planned withdrawal . Although the joint chiefs had recommended that a much slower and more modest withdrawal be , undertaken , they now support Carter 's plan to move more quickly .
