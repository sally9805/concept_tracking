An appointment with knowledge The conditions of a-solitary bird are five : The first , that it flies to the highest point ; the second , that it does not suffer for company , not even of its own kind ; the third , that it aims its beak to the skies ; the fourth , that it does not have a definite color ; the fifth , that it sings very softly . San Juan de la Cruz , Dichos de Luz y Amor I HAD NOT SEEN don Juan for several months . It was the autumn of 1971 . I had the certainty that he was at the house of don Genaro , a fellow sorcerer in central Mexico , and made the necessary preparations for a long drive to visit him . On the second day of my journey , however , on an impulse , I stopped at don Juan 's place in Sonora in the midafternoon . To my surprise , I found him there . My surprise seemed to delight him . He was sitting on an empty milk crate by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for inc . There was an air of accomplishment in the ease with which he greeted me . He took off his hat and flourished it in a comical gesture . Then he put it on again and gave me a military salute . " Sit down , sit down , " he said jovially . " I was going to go all the way to central Mexico for nothing , " I said . " And then I would 've had to drive back to Los Angeles . Finding you here has saved me days of driving . " " Somehow you would 've found me , " he said in a mysterious tone , " but let 's say that you owe me the six days that you would 've needed to get there . " I mentioned that I had reviewed my early notes and had realized that he had been giving me a detailed description of the sorcerers ' world from the beginning of our association . In light of what he had said to me in those stages , I had begun to question the role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take those power plants so many times ? " I asked . He mumbled softly , " ' Cause you 're dumb . " He tapped me on the head . " You 're rather slow , and there was no other way to jolt you . " " So none of that was absolutely necessary ? " I asked . " It was , in your case . There are other types of people , however , that do not seem to need them . " He said that Eligio , his other apprentice , had taken psychotropic plants only once , and yet he , was perhaps even more advanced than I was . " To be sensitive is a natural condition of certain people , " he said . " You are not . But neither am I. In the final analysis , sensitivity matters very little . You have already accomplished some tasks of sorcery , and I believe this is the time to mention the source of everything that matters . Sot will say that what matters to a warrior is arriving at the totality of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gesture to signal that he wanted me to stop talking . Apparently there was something or somebody nearby . He tilted his head to the left , as if to listen . I could see the whites of his eyes as he focused on the bushes beyond the house . He listened attentively for a few ITIOrftz:litS and then whispered that we had to go for a walk . " Is there somethi. ? - Lg ' wrong ? " I asked , also in a whisper . " No . Nothing is wrong , " he said . " Every thing is rather right . " He led me into the desert chapairal , to a small circular area free from vegetation , a spot about twelve feet in diameter where the reddish dirt was packed and perfectly flat . Don Juan sat down in the center of it , facing the southeast . He pointed to a place about five feet away from him and asked me to sit there , facing him . " We have an appointment here tonight , " he said . He scanned the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat until he was again facing the southeast . His movements had alarmed me . I asked him whom we had the appointment with . " With knowledge , " he said . " Let 's say that knowledge is prowling around here . " He quickly changed the subject and urged me to be natural , that is , to take notes and talk as we would have done at his house . What was most pressing to me at that time was the vivid sensation I had had six months before of " talking " to a coyote . That event meant to me that for the first time I had been capable of visualizing or apprehending , through my senses and in sober consciousness , the sorcerers ' description of the world , a description in which communicating with animals through speech was a matter of course . " We 're not going to engage ourselves in dwelling on any experience of that nature , " don Juan said upon hearing my question . " There are lots of things that you do now which would have seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not change , but your idea of yourself changed ; what wasimpossible before is perfectly possible now , find perhaus your total success in changing yourself is only a matter of time . In this affair the only possible course that a warrior has is to act consistently and without reservations . You know enough - of t ' ; 2. : ; warrior 's way to act accordingly , but your old habits and routines stand in your way . " I understood what he meant . " Do you think that writing is one of the old habits I should change ? " I asked . He did not answer . He stood up and turned to look at the edge of the chaparral. 1 told him that I had received letters from various people telling me that it was wrong to write about my apprenticeship . They had cited as a te-r ? , - ; : tent that the masters of Eastern esoteric dear. - oe7s demanded absolute secrecy about their teachings . " Perhaps those masters are just indulging in being masters , " don Juan said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ master . I 'm only a warrior . So I really do n't know what a master feels like . ' " But maybe I 'm revealing things I should n't , , ion Juan . " " It , does n't matter what one reveals or what one keeps to oneself , " he said . " Everything we do , everything we are , rests on our personal power . If we have enough of it , one word ut'ered to us might be sufficient to change the course of our lives . But if we do n't have enough personal power , the most magnificent piece of wisdom can be revealed to us and that revelation wo n't make a damn bit of difference . ' p ON JUAN WANTED TO KNOW the salient points . I began telling him that the difficulty of setting up the command to look at my hands seemed to be , quite often , insurmountable . He had warned me that the early stage of the preparatory facet , which he called " setting up dreaming , " consisted of a deadly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that some part of myself was going to do everything it could to prevent the fulfillment of my task . That could include , don Juan had said , plunging roe into a 4.5 loss of meaning , melancholy , or even a suicidal depression . I did not go that far , however . My experience was rather on the light , comical side : nonetheless , the result was equally frustrating . Every time I was about to look at my hands in a dream something extraordinary would happen ; I would begin to fly , or my dream would turn into a nightmare , or it would simply become a very pleasant experience of bodily excitation ; everything in the dream would extend far beyond the " normal ' in matters of vividness and , therefore , be terribly absorbing . My original intention of observing my hands was always forgotten in light of the new situation . One night , quite unexpectedly , I found my hands in my dream . I dreamt that I was walking on an unknown street in a foreign city and suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my face . It was as if something within myself had given up and had permitted me to watch the backs of my hands . Don Juan 's instructions had been that as soon as the sight of my hands would begin to dissolve or change into something else , I had to shift my view from my hands to any other element in the surroundings of my dream . In that particular dream I shifted my view to a building . When the sight of the building began to dissipate , I focused my attention on the other elements of the surroundings in my dream . The end result was an incredibly clear composite picture of a deserted street in some unknown foreign city . At the end of my report of this and other experiences in " dreaming , " don Juan went to the bushes . I stood up , too . I was nervous . It was an unwarranted sensation , since there was nothing precipitating fear or concern . Don Juan returned shortly . He noticed my agitation . He made me sit down and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to write . His argument was that I should not disturb the power place with feelings of fear or hesitation . " Why do I get so nervous ? " I asked . " It 's natural , " he said . " Something in you is threatened by your activities in dreaming . As long as you did not think about those activities , you were all right . But now that you have revealed your actions you 're about to faint . " Each warrior has his own way of dreaming . Each way is different . The only thing Which we all have in common is that we play tricks in order to force ourselves to abandon the quest . The countermeasure is to persist in spite of all the barriers and disappointments . A warrior chooses a topic by deliberately holding an image in his mind while he shuts off his internal dialogue . In other words , if he is capable of not talking to himself for a moment and then holds the image or the thought of what he wants in dreaming , even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to him . I 'm sure you 've done that , although you were not aware of it . " He walked to the edge of the bushes and peered into the foliage . He seemed to be examining something in the leaves , without getting too close to them . " What are you doing ? " I asked . He returned to me , smiled , and raised his brow . The bushes are filled with strange things , " he said as he sat down again . His tone was so casual that it scared me more than if he had let out a sudden yell . My notebook and pencil fell from my hands . He laughed and mimicked me and said that my exaggerated reactions were one of the loose ends that still existed in my life . I wanted to raise a point , but he would not let me talk . He then added that , judging by my production in " dreaming , " I must have learned how to stop my internal dialogue at will . I told him that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Juan had delineated another procedure : walking for long stretches without focusing the eyes on anything . His recommendation had been to not look at anything directly but , by slightly crossing the eyes , to keep a peripheral view of everything that presented itself to the eyes . He had insisted , although I had not understood at the time , that if one kept one 's unfocused eyes at a point just above the horizon , it was possible to notice , at once , everything in almost the total 180-degree range in front of one 's eyes . He had assured me that that exercise was the only way of shutting off the internal dialogue . I TOLD DON JUAN that I had practiced the technique for years without noticing any change , but I had expected none anyway . One day , however , I had the shocking realization that I had just walked for about ten minutes without having said a single word to myself . I mentioned to don Juan that On that occasion I also became cognizant that stopping the internal dialogue involved more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Myentire thought processes had stopped , and I had felt I was practically suspended , floating . A sensation of panic had ensued from that awareness , and I had to resume my internal dialogue as an anti-dote . " I 've told you that the internal dialogue is what grounds us , " don Juan said . " The world is such and such or so and so only because we talk to ourselves about its being such and such or so and so . " Don Juan explained that the passageway into the . world of sorcerers opens up after the warrior . has learned to shut off the internal dialogue . ) 1 " To change our idea of the world is the crux of sorcery , " he said , " and stopping the internal dialogue is the only way to accomplish it . The rest is just padding . Now you 're in the position to know that nothing of what you 've seen or done , with the exception of stopping the internal dialogue , could by itself have changed anything in you , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , that that change should not be deranged . " We talked until it became dark and I could no longer take notes in a comfortable manner : I had to pay attention to my writing and that altered my concentration . Don Juan became aware of it and began to laugh . He pointed out that I had accomplished another sorcery task , writing without concentrating . The moment he said it , I realized that I really did not pay attention to the act of taking notes . It seemed to be a separate activity I had nothing to do with . When it grew dark , he asked me to command myself to be silent and without thoughts . I could not do it at first and had a moment of impatience . Don Juan turned his back to me and told me to lean on his shoulder for support . He said that once I had quieted down my thoughts , I should keep my eyes open , facing the bushes toward the southeast . He added that he was setting up a problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be ready for another facet of the sorcerers ' world . Then something in me was turned off . I felt I was suspended . My ears seemed to unplug , and a myriad of noises in the chaparral became audible . There were so many that I could notdistinguish them individually . I felt I was falling asleep and then all at once something caught my attention . It was not something which involved my thought processes ; it was not a vision , or a feature of the environment either , yet my awareness had been engaged . I was fully awake . My eyes were focused on a spot on the edge of the chaparral , but I was not looking , or thinking , or talking to myself . My feelings were clear bodily sensations ; they did not need words . I felt I was rushing through something indefinite . Perhaps what would have ordinarily been my thoughts were rushing ; at any rate , I had the sensation that I had been caught in a landslide and something was avalanching , with me at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Something was pulling me into the chaparral . I could distinguish the dark mass of the bushes in front of me . It was not , however , an undifferentiated darkness as it would ordinarily be . I could see every individual hush as if I were looking at it in a dark twilight . They seemed to he moving ; the mass of their foliage looked like black skirts flowing toward me as if they were being blown by the wind , but there was no wind . I became absorbed in their mesmerizing movements ; it was a pulsating ripple that seemed to draw them nearer and nearer to me . And then I noticed a lighter silhouette which seemed to be superimposed on the dark shapes of the bushes . I focused my eyes on a spot to the side of the lighter silhouette , and I could make out a chartreuse glow on it . Then I looked at it without focusing and I had the certainty that the lighter silhouette was a man hiding in the underbrush . I was , at that moment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cognizant of the surroundings and of the mental processes that the surroundings engendered in myself , yet I was not thinking as I ordinarily think . For a moment I had the impression that I could hold the man and force him to remain where he was . I then experienced a strange pain in the pit of my stomach . Something seemed to rip inside me , and I could not hold the muscles of my midsection tense any longer . At the very moment I let go , the dark shape of an enormous bird , or some sort of flying animal , lurched at me from the chaparral . It was as if the shape of the man had turned into the shape of a bird . I had the clear conscious perception of fear . I gasped and then let out a loud yell and fell on my back . Don Juan helped me up . His face was very close to mine . He was laughing . " What was that ? " I shouted . He put his hand over my mouth and whispered that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collected fashion , as if nothing had hap ) ened . We walked side by side . His pace was relaxed ind even . A couple of times he turned around iuickly . I did the same and twice I caught sight ) f a dark mass that seemed to be following us. heard a loud shriek behind me . I experienced t moment of sheer terror ; ripples ran through he muscles of my stomach ; they came in spasms and grew in intensity until they simply forced my body to run . Suddenly I found myself again at don Juan 's house . Apparently he had also run , and we had arrived at the same time . " What happened out there , don Juan ? " I finally asked . " You had an appointment with knowledge , " he said . " I took you there because I caught a glimpse of knowledge prowling around the house earlier . You might say that knowledge knew that you were coming and was waiting for you . Rather than meeting it here , I felt it was proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set up a test to see if you had enough personal power to isolate it from the rest of the things around us . You did fine . " " Wait a minute ! " I protested . " I saw the silhouette of a man hiding behind a bush , and then I saw a huge bird . " " You did n't see a man ! " he said emphatically . " Neither did you see a bird . The silhouette in the bushes and what flew to us was a moth . If you want to be accurate in sorcerers ' terms , but very ridiculous in your own terms , you could say that tonight you had an appointment with a moth . Knowledge is a moth . " A AFTER A TIME , I heard a strange deep sound , like tapping on wood , that came from the chaparral . Don Juan jutted his chin , signaling me to remain alert . " That 's the little moth calling you , " he said in an unemotional tone . I jumped to my feet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an explanation . He made a comical gesture of helplessness , shrugging his shoulders . " You have n't fulfilled your appointment yet , " he added . I told him that I felt unworthy and that perhaps I should go home and come back when I felt stronger . " You 're talking nonsense , " he snapped . " A warrior takes his lot . whatever it may be , and accepts it in ultimate humbleness . He accepts in humbleness what he is , not as grounds for regret but as a living challenge . That 's why I told you earlier today that I did n't understand what masters felt like . I know only the humbleness of a warrior , and that will never permit me to be anyone 's master . " We were quiet for a moment . His words had caused me a profound agitation . I was moved by them and at the same time I felt concerned with what I had witnessed in the chaparral . My conscious assessment was that don Juan was holding out on me and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was involved in those deliberations when tile same strange tapping noise jolted me out of my thoughts . " You like the humbleness of a beggar , " he said softly . ' You how your head to reason . " " 1 always think that Fin being tricked , " I said . " That 's the crux of my problem . " " You 're right . You are being tricked , " he retorted with a disarming smile . " That can not be your problem . The real crux of the matter is that you feel that I am deliberately lying to you , ani I correct ? " " Yes . There is something in myself that does n't let me believe that what 's taking place is real . " " You 're right again . Nothing of what is taking place is real . " ' What do you mean by that . don Juan ? " " Things are real only after one has learned to agree on their realness . What took place this evening . for instance . can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agree with you about it . " " Do you mean that you did n't see what hap-pened ? " " Of course I did . But I do n't count . I am the one who 's lying to you , remember ? " His expression was deliberately comical , and we both laughed . I told him that what he had just said made me feel more afraid than ever . " You-re afraid of me ? " he asked . " Not of you , but of what you represent . " " I represent the warrior 's freedom . Are you afraid of that ? " " No . But I 'm afraid of the awesomeness of your knowledge . There is no solace for me , no haven to go to . " " You 're again confusing issues . Solace , haven , fear , all of them are moods that you have I learned without ever questioning their value . As one can see , the black magicians have already engaged all your allegiance . " " Who are the black magicians , don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magicians . And since you are with them , you too are a black magician . Think for a moment . Can you . deviate from the path that they 've lined up for you ? No . Your thoughts and your actions are fixed forever in their terms . That is slavery . I , ? on the other hand , brought you freedom . Freedom is expensive , but the price is not impossible . So , fear . your captors , your masters . Do n't , waste your . time arid your power fearing me . " I knew that he Was right , and yet in spite of my genuine agreement with him I also knew that ; my lifelong- habits would make me stick to myi old path . 1 did indeed feel like a slave . After a long silence don Juan asked me if I had enough strength for another bout with knowledge . " What do you really mean when you say that knowledge is a moth ? " I asked . ? " I have no other meanings , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 thought that by now , with all your accomplishments , ' you " 4ould have had enough power to see . You caught sight of a man instead , and that was not true seeing . " r RUM THE BEGINNING of my apprenticeship , r don Juan had depicted the concept of " seeing " - as a special capacity that one could develop and which would allow one to apprehend the " ultimate " nature of things . ? Over the years of our association I had developed a notion that what he meant by " seeing " was an intuitive grasp of things , or the capacity to understand something at once , oz perhaps the ability to see through human in , teractions and discover covert meanings ant ' motives . " I should say that tonight , when you faced the moth , you were half looking and . half seeing , ' don Juan proceeded . " ' In that state , although you were not altogether your usual self , you : were still capable of being fully aware in order to operate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world told yon Wat in th ( bushes one can only find animals prowling o , men hiding . You held that thought , and natu rally you had to find ways to make the work conform to that . thought . " " But I was n't thinking at all , don Juan . ' " Let 's not call it thinking . then . It is , rather the habit of having the world always conform t4 our thoughts . When it does n't , we simply mak. it conform .. Moths as large as a man can not b , even a thought , therefore , for you . what was in the bushes had to be a man . " The same thing happened with the coyote . Your old habits decided the nature of that encounter , too . Something took place between you and the coyote , but it was n't talk . 1 have been in the same quandary myself . I 've told you that once I talked with a deer ; now you 've talked to a coyote , but neither you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " What are you telling me , don Juan ? " " When the sorcerers ' explanation became clear to me , it was too late to know what the deer did to me . I said that we talked , but that was n't so . To say that we had a conversation is only a way of arranging it so I can talk about it . The deer and I did something , but at the time it was taking place 1 needed to make the world conform to my ideas , just like you did , I had been talking all my life , just like you , therefore my habits prevailed and were extended to the deer . When the deer came to me and did whatever it did , I was forced to understand it as talking . " " Is this the sorcerers ' explanation ? " " No . This is my explanation for you . But it is not opposed to the sorcerers ' explanation . " His statement threw me into a state of great intellectual excitation . For a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I tried to rephrase his statements , and we involved ourselves in a long discussion about the reflexive nature of our world . The world , according to don Juan , had to conform to its description : that is , the description reflected itself . I felt a shiver ; my heart began to pound fast . Don Juan signaled me to sit down and keep on writing . " If you get too frightened , you wo n't he able to keep your appointment , " he said . " A warrior must he calm and collected and must never lose his grip . " " I 'm really scared , " I said . " Moth or whatever , there is something prowling around out there in the bushes . " " Of course there is ! " he exclaimed . " My objection is that you insist on thinking that it is a man , just like you insist on thinking that you talked with a coyote . " A part of me fully understood his point ; there was , however , another aspect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evidence clung to " reason . " I told don Juan that his explanation did not satisfy my senses , although I was in complete intellectual agreement with it . " That 's the flaw with words , " he said in an assuring tone . " They always force us to feel enlightened , but when we turn around to face the world they always fail us and we end up facing the world as we always have , without enlightenment . For this reason , a sorcerer seeks to act rather than to talk , and to this effect he gets a new description of the world ? a new description where talking is not that important , and where new acts have new reflections . " He sat down by me and gazed into my eyes and asked me to voice what I had really - seen " in the chaparral . I was confronted at the moment with an absorbing inconsistency . I had seen the dark shape of a man , but I had also seen that shape turn into a bird . I had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to consider possible . But rather than discarding my reason altogether , something in myself had selected parts of my experience , such as the size and general contour of the dark shape , and held them as reasonable possibilities , while it discarded other parts , such as the dark shape turning into a bird . And thus 1 had become convinced that I had seen a man . Don Juan said that sooner or later the sorcerers ' explanation would come to my rescue , and everything would then be perfectly clear , without having to be reasonable or unreasonable . " In the meantime , all I can do for you is to guarantee that that was not a man , " he said . 1 W E WENT OUTSIDE , to the ramada in front of the house . Don Juan hooked the kerosem lantern on a beam . " We 're going to sit here , " he said , " and yoi : are going to write and talk to me in a very nor mal manner . The moth that lurched at you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come closer to look at you . That 's why I 've put the lantern or a beam right above you . The light will guide tht moth to find you . When it gets to the edge of tIn hushes , it will call you . It is a very special sound The sound by itself may help you . It is a song Ordinarily it can not be heard , but the moth our there is a rare moth ; you will hear its call clear ly , and , providing that you are impeccable , i will remain with you for the rest of your life . " i " What is it going to help me with ? " " Tonight you 're going to try to finish wha you 've started earlier . Seeing happens only whey the warrior is capable of stopping the interns dialogue . " Today , you stopped your talk at will . Arh you saw . What you saw was not clear . Yot thought that it was a man . I say it was a motE Neither of us is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I still have the upper hand becaus I see better than you and because I 'm familia with the sorcerers ' explanation ; so I know , a though it 's not altogether accurate , that th shape you saw tonight was a moth . " And now you 're going to remain silent an thoughtless and let that little moth come to yo a.ain . " I could hardly take notes . Don Juan urged ni to keep on writing as if nothing bothered MI He said that writing was the best shield that I had . At that moment , I heard a sound like a muffled creaking of a branch rubbing against another , or like the sputtering of a small motor heard from a distance . It changed scales , like a musical tone , creating an eerie rhythm . Then it stopped . " That was the moth , " don Juan said . " Per- ' , raps you 've already noticed that , although the ight of the lantern is bright enough to attract noths , there is n't a single one flying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , but once don Juan made me aware of it , I also noticed an neredible silence in the desert around the house . " Do n't get jumpy , " he said calmly . " There is tothing in this world that a warrior can not acount for . You see , a warrior considers himself ilready dead , so there is nothing for him to lose . " he worst has already happened to him ; there-ore , he 's clear and calm . Judging him by his cts or by his words , one would never suspect hat he has witnessed everything . " Don Juan 's words , and above all his mood , /ere very soothing to me. 1 told him that in my ay-to-day life I no longer experienced the obessive fear I used to , but that my body entered Ito convulsions of fright at the thought of what as out there in the dark . " Out there , there is only knowledge , " he said a factual tone . " Knowledge is frightening , . ue ; but if a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its awesome- esa.The sputtering noise happened again . It .. emed closer and louder . I listened carefully . he more attention I paid to it , the more ( Milt it was to determine its nature . It did not ! en ' to be the call of a bird or the cry of a land iimal . The tone of each sputter was rich and rep ; some were produced in a low key , others a high one . They had a rhythm and a specific iration . Some were long ; others were short and ippened in a cluster , like the staccato sound of machine gun . The moths are the heralds or , better yet , the iardians of eternity , " don Juan said after the and had stopped . " For some reason , or for no ason at all , they are the depositories of the ad dust of eternity . " The metaphor was foreign to me . I asked rn to explain it . " The moths carry a dust on their wings , " he id . " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " His explanation had made the metaphor even lre obscure . I vacillated for a moment trying find the best way of wording my question . But began to talk again . " Knowledge for a warrior is something that riles at once , engulfs him , and passes on . " " What does knowledge have to do with the dust on the Brings of moths ? " I asked after long pause . " The moths have been the intimate friends and helpers of sorcerers from time immemorial , " he said . " Knowledge comes floating like specks of gold dust , the same dust that covers the wings of moths . So , for a warrior , knowledge is like being rained on by specks of dark gold dust . " The problem for tonight is seeing people , " he said . " First you must stop your internal dialogue , then you must bring up the image of the person that you want to see ; any thought that one holds in mind in a state of silence is properly a command , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tonight the moth in the bushes wants to help you , so it will sing for you . Its song will bring the golden specks , and then you will see the person you 've selected . " I wanted to have more details , but he made an abrupt gesture and signaled me to proceed . After struggling for a few minutes to stop my internal dialogue , I was thoroughly silent . And then I deliberately held the brief thought of a friend of mine . I kept my eyes closed for what I believed to be just an instant , and then I became aware that someone was shaking me by the shoulders . I opened my eyes and found myself lying on my left side . I had apparently fallen asleep so deeply that I did not remember having slumped to the ground . Don Juan said we had to start all over . I FOLLOWED the necessary steps . The strange sputtering sound happened again . This time , however , it did not come from the chaparral ; rather is seemed to happen inside of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or arms were producing it . The sound soon engulfed me . I felt like soft balls were being sputtered out from or against me ; it was a soothing , exquisite feeling of being bombarded by heavy cotton puffs . Suddenly I heard a door blown open by a gust of wind and I was thinking again . I thought that I had ruined another chance . I opened my eyes and found myself in my room . The objects on my desk were as I had left them . The door was open ; there was a strong wind outside . The thought crossed my mind that I should check the water heater . I then heard a rattling on the sliding windows that I had put up myself and which did not fit well on the window frame . It was a furious rattling , as if someone wanted to enter . I experienced a jolt of fright . I stood up from my chair . I felt something pulling me . I screamed . Don Juan was shaking me by the shoulders . I excitedly gave him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vivid that I was shivering . I felt that I had just been at my desk , in my full corporeal form . Don Juan shook his head in disbelief and said that I was a genius in tricking myself . He flatly discarded my account and ordered me to start again . I then heard the mysterious sound coming from the chaparral ; I felt it as if it were coming from the depths of myself . The sound came to me , as don Juan had suggested , in the form of a rain of golden specks . They seemed to not be flakes but , rather , spherical bubbles . They floated toward me . One of them burst open and revealed a scene to me . It was as if it had stopped in front of my eyes and opened up , disclosing a strange object . It looked like a mushroom . I was definitely looking at it , and what I was experiencing was not a dream . The mushroomlike object remained unchanged within my field of " vision . " and then it popped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been turned off . An interminable darkness followed it . I felt a tremor , a very unsettling jolt , and then I had the abrupt realization that I was being shaken . All at once my senses were turned on . Don Juan was shaking me vigorously , and I was looking at him . I must have just opened my eyes . He sprinkled water on my face . The coldness of the water was very appealing . After a moment 's pause he wanted to know what had happened . I recounted every detail of my vision . " But what did I see ? " I asked . " Your friend , " he retorted . I laughed and patiently explained that I had " seen " a mushroomlike figure . Although I had no criteria to judge dimensions , I had had the feeling that it was about a foot long . Don Juan emphasized that feeling was all that counted . He said that my feelings were the gauge that assessed the state of being of the subject that I was " seeing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must conclude that your friend must be a very fine man , " he said . I was baffled by his words . He said that the mushroomlike formation was the essential shape of human beings when a sorcerer was " seeing " them from far away , but when a sorcerer was directly facing the person he was " seeing , " the human quality was shown as an egglike cluster of luminous fibers . " You were not facing your friend , " he said . " Therefore , he appeared like a mushroom . That simply is the way men appear in this specific type of seeing . " He added that every feature of the mushroom-like formation had a special significance , but that it was impossible for a beginner to accu ? rately interpret that significance . I then had an intriguing recollection . Some years before , in a state of nonordinary realit ) elicited by the intake of psychotropic plants , l had experienced or perceived , while I was look ing at a water stream , that a cluster of bubble ' floated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had just envisioned had floated ant engulfed me in exactly the same manner . Tr fact . I could say that both clusters had had tIn same structure and the same pattern . Don Juan listened to my commentaries with out interest . " Do n't waste your power on trifles , " be said " You are dealing with that immensity out there . ' He pointed toward the chaparral . " To turn that magnificence out there int , reasonableness does n't do anything for you . Here , surrounding us , is eternity itself . To engage in reducing it to a manageable nonsense is petty and outright disastrous . " He then insisted that I should attempt to " see " others of my acquaintance . He added that once the vision had terminated I should strive to open my eyes by myself and surface to the full awareness of my immediate surroundings . By the time I had finished calling on thirty-two people , I found that I had " seen " a variety of mushroomlike shapes and glows , and I had had a variety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheer disgust . Don Juan explained that men were filled with zonfigurations that could be wishes , problems , Sorrows , worries , and so on . He asserted that mly a profoundly powerful sorcerer could unangle the meaning of those configurations , and hat I had to be content with viewing only the general shape of men . My overall sensation was one of queasiness. lose strange shapes had made me feel trapped and doomed . Don Juan then asked me to call on people hat he himself would select . A new series of forms emerged . They were tot mushroomlike , but looked more like Japatese cups for sake , turned upside down . Their hapes were appealing and peaceful . I sensed hat there was some inherent feeling of happiess about them . They bounced , as opposed to ' le earthbound heaviness that the previous batch ad exhibited . " Why are those people shaped differently ? " asked . " They have more personal power , " he replied . " What has given them that lightness ? Were they born that way ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but we become earthbound and fixed . We make ourselves that way . So perhaps we may say that these people are shaped differently because they live like warriors . " W E STOOD UP and stretched his arms and legs . He told rue to do the same . / noticed that there was a tinge of light in the sky toward the east . We sat down again . He leaned over and whispered , " The last person you 're going to call is Genaro . " I felt a surge of curiosity and excitation . I breezed through the required steps . The strange sound from the edge of the chaparral became vivid and acquired new strength . I had almost forgotten about it . The golden bubbles engulfed me and then in one of them I saw don Genaro himself . He was standing in front of me , holding his hat in his hand . He was smiling . I hurriedly opened my eyes and was about to speak to don Juan , but before I could say a word my body stiffened like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long moment I did not know what to do or say . Don Genaro was standing right in front of me . In person ! I turned to don Juan ; he was smiling . Then both of them broke into a giant laugh . I also tried to laugh . I could not . I stood up . Don Genaro scratched his head and hid a grin . " Are n't you going to greet Genaro ? " don Juan asked . It took an enormous effort for me to organize my thoughts and my feelings . I finally mumbled some greetings to don Genaro . He Look a bow . " You called me , did n't you ? " he asked . I muttered my amazement at having found him standing there . " He did call you , " don Juan interjected . " Well , here I am , " don Genaro said to rue . " What can I do for you ? " Slowly my mind seemed to become clear , and I " knew " what had really taken place : don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon as they had heard my car approaching , don Genaro had slipped into the bushes and had remained in hiding until it got dark . Don Juan , since he had no doubt engineered the entire affair , gave me clues from time to time , thus guiding its development . At the appropriate time , don Genaro had made me notice his presence , and when don Juan and I were walking back to the house , he followed us in the most obvious manner in order to arouse my fear . Then he had waited in the chaparral and made the strange sound whenever don Juan had signaled him . The final signal to come out from behind the bushes must have been given by don Juan while my eyes were closed after he had asked me to " call " don Genaro . Then don Genaro must have walked to the ramada , waited until I opened my eyes , and then scared me out of my wits . The only incongruencies in my logical explanatory scheme were that I had actually seen the man hiding in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had first visualized don Genaro as an image in a golden bubble . In my vision he had been dressed exactly as he was in person . Since there was no logical way for me to explain those incongruencies , I assumed , as I have always done in similar circumstances , that the emotional stress may have played an important role in determining what I " believed I saw . " I began to laugh quite involuntarily at the thought of their preposterous trick . I told them about my deductions . They laughed uproariously . I honestly believed that their laughter was the giveaway . " You were hiding in the bushes , were n't you ? " I asked don Genaro . Don Juan sat down and held his head in both hands . " No . I was n't hiding , " don Genaro said patiently . " I was far from here and then you called , so I came to see you . " " Where were you , don Genaro ? " " Far away . " " How far ? " Don Juan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an act of deference to me , and that I could not ask where he had been , because he had been nowhere . Don Genaro came to my defense and said that it was all right to ask him anything . " If you were not hiding around the house where were you , don Genaro ? " I asked . " I was at my house , " he said with gre ; candor . " In central Mexico ? " " Yes ! It 's the only house rye got . " They looked at each other and again brok into laughter . I knew that they were kidding me but I decided not to contest the point any hi : tiler . I thought they must have had a reason fc engaging themselves in such an elaborate pre duction . I sat down . I felt that I was truthfully cut in two ; son4 part of me was not shocked at all and coul accept any of don Juan 's or don Genaro 's acts their face value . But there was another part me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscious assessment was that I had accep ed don Juan 's sorcery description of the worl merely on an intellectual basis , while my boc as a whole entity refused it , thus my dilemm But then , over the course of the years of n association with don Juan and don Genaro , had experienced extraordinary phenomena , ar those had been bodily experiences , not intelle tual ones . Earlier that very night I had In incredible visions through no other means the my own volition . I explained to them the nature of my painf and at the same time bona fide perplexity . " This guy is a genius , " don Juan said to do Genaro , shaking his head in disbelief . " You 're a huge genius , Carlitos , " don Genai said , as if he were relaying a message . D ON JUAN ORDERED ME to stop my though but to keep my eyes open , focused on tl edge of the chaparral in front of me . He sa that the moth had changed positions becau don Genaro was there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself to me , it would choose to con from the front . After a moment 's struggle to quiet n thoughts , I perceived the sound again . It w richer than ever . I heard first the muffled ste on dry twigs , and then I felt them on my hod At that instant I distinguished a dark mass reedy in front of me , at the edge of the chaparr . I felt I was being shaken . I opened my eye Don Juan and don Genaro were standing abo me and I was kneeling , as if I had fallen asle in a crouching position . Don Juan gave me sor water , and I sat down again with my ha against the wall . A short while later it was dawn . The chapi ral seemed to wake up . The morning cold w crisp and invigorating . The moth had not been don Genaro . My tional structure was falling apart . I did not wr to ask any more questions , nor did I want remain quiet . I finally had to talk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; enaro , how did you get here ? " I asked . Don Genaro made some ludicrous and utterly ilarious gestures with his mouth . " I 'm sorry , " he said to me , " my mouth loes n't want to talk . " He then turned to don Juan and said , grin-ling , " Why do n't you tell him ? " Don Juan vacillated . Then he said that don enaro , as a consummate artist of sorcery , was apable of prodigious deeds . Don Genaro 's chest swelled as if don Juan 's ords were inflating it . He seemed to have inaled so much air that his chest looked twice : s normal size . He appeared to be on the verge f floating . He leaped in the air . I had the imression that the air inside his lungs had forced im to jump . He paced back and forth on the in floor until he apparently got his chest uner control ; he patted it and with great force in the palms of his hands from his pectoral ruscles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tube of a tire . He finally sat down . Don Juan 's eyes were shining with sheer deght . " Write your notes , " he ordered me softly . Write , write , or you 'll die ! " Then he remarked that even don Genaro no nger felt that my taking notes was so outndish . " That 's right ! " don Genaro retorted . " I 've ! en thinking of taking up writing myself . " " Genaro is a man of knowledge , " don Juan id . " And , being a man of knowledge , he 's peretly capable of transporting himself over great stances . " He reminded me that once , years before , the ree of us had been in the mountains , and that Genaro , in an effort to help me overcome y stupid reason , had taken a prodigious leap the peaks of the Sierras , ten miles away . I membered the event , but I also remembered at I could not even conceive that he had owed . Don Juan added that don Genaro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Genaro at certain times is not Genaro but double , " he said . He repeated it three or four times . Then both them watched me as if waiting for my imnding reaction . I had not understood what he meant by " his able . " He had never mentioned that before . Isked for a clarification . " There is another Genaro , " he explained . All three of us looked at one another . I bene very apprehensive . You may say , " don Juan went on , " that at s moment Genaro is his twin . " That statement brought them both a fit of ghter . But I could not enjoy their mirth . My ly shivered involuntarily . Don Juan said in a severe tone that I was too heavy and self-important . " Let go ! " he commanded me . " You know that Genaro is capable of performing deeds that would be unthinkable for the average man . His double , the other Genaro , is one of those deeds . " After pondering for a long time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other like the self ? " " The other is the self , " don Juan replied . " What 's the other made of ? " I asked don Juan after minutes of indecision . " There is no way of knowing that , " he said . " Is it real or just an illusion ? " " It 's real , of course . " " Would it be possible then to say that it is made of flesh and blood ? " I asked . " No . It would not be possible , " don Genaro answered . " But if it is as real as I am ... " " As real as you ? " don Juan and don Genaro interjected in unison . Don Genaro threw his hat on the floor and danced around it . His dance was agile and graceful and , for some inexplicable reason , utterly funny . Perhaps the humor was in the exquisite . ly " professional " movements he executed . The incongruency was so subtle and at the same time so remarkable that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Carlitos , " he said as he sat down again , " is that you 're a genius . " " I have to know about the double , " I said . " There 's no way of knowing whether he 's flesh and blood , " don Juan said , " because he is not as real as you . Genaro 's double is as real as Genaro . Do you see what I mean ? " " But you have to admit , don Juan , that there must be a way to know . " " The double is the self : that explanation should suffice . If you would see , however , you 'd know that there is a great difference between Genaro and his double . For a sorcerer who sees , the double is brighter . " I FELT I WAS TOO WEAK to ask any more ques- tions . I put my writing pad down and for a moment I thought I was going to pass out . I had tunnel vision ; everything around me was dark with the exception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my eyes . Don Genaro announced that he was famished , and went to the back of the house . Don Juan also stood up and signaled me to follow . In the kitchen , don Genaro gave himself a serving of food and then began comically mimicking a person who wants to eat but ca n't swallow . I ate a huge amount of food , and so did don Juan ; then we all returned to the front of the house . The sunlight was brilliant , the sky was clear , and the morning breeze sharpened the air . I felt happy and strong . We sat in a triangle facing one another . I felt that I was again in top form and wanted to exploit my strength . " Tell me more about the double , don Juan , " I said . " A double is the sorcerer himself , developed through his dreaming , " don Juan explained . " A double is an act of power to a sorcerer but only a tale of power to you . In the case of Genaro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's because his impeccability as a warrior is supreme ; thus , you 've never noticed the difference yourself . But in the years that you 've known him , you 've been with the original Genaro only twice ; every other time you 've been with his double . " " But this is preposterous ! " I exclaimed . I felt an anxiety building up in my chest . I became so agitated that I dropped my writing pad , and my pencil rolled out of sight . Don Juan and don Genaro immediately began a most farcical search for it . I had never seen a more astonishing performance of theatrical magic and sleight of hand . Except that there was no stage , or props , or any type of gadgetry , and the performers did not seem to be using sleight of hand . Don Genaro , the head magician , and his assistant , don Juan , produced in a matter of minutes the most astounding , bizarre , and outlandish collection of objects which they found underneath , or behind , or above every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style of stage magic , don Genaro would proceed to find an object , which he would throw away as soon as he had attested that it was not my pencil . The collection of objects found included pieces of clothing , wigs , eyeglasses , toys , utensils , pieces of machinery , women 's underwear , human teeth , sandwiches , and religious objects . One of them was outright disgusting . It was a piece of compact human excrement that don Genaro took from underneath my jacket . Finally , don Genaro found my pencil and handed it to me after dusting it off with the tail of his shirt . They celebrated their clowning with yells and chuckles . I found myself watching , unable to join them . " Do n't take things so seriously , Carlitos , " don Genaro said with a tone of concern . After their laughter subsided , I asked what a double did , or what a sorcerer did with the double . Don Juan said that the double had power , and that it was used to accomplish feats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've told you time and time again that the world is unfathomable , " he said to rne . " And so are we , and so is every being that exists in this world . It is impossible , therefore , to reason out the double . You 've been allowed to witness it , though , and that should be more than enough . " " But there must be a way to talk about it , " I said . " You yourself have told me that you explained your conversation with the deer in order to talk about it . Ca n't you do the same with the double ? " He was quiet for a moment . I pleaded with him . The anxiety I was experiencing was beyond ' anything I had ever gone through . " Well , a sorcerer can double up , " don Juan : said . " That 's all one can say . " " But is he aware that he is doubled ? " " Of course he 's aware of it . " " Does he know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Both of them looked at me , and then the ) exchanged a glance . " Where is the other don Genaro ? " I asked . Don Genaro leaned toward me and stare ( into my eyes . " I do n't know , " he said softly . " No sorcere knows where his other is . " " Genaro is right , " don Juan said . " A soreere has no notion that he is in two places at once To be aware of that would be the equivalent o facing his double , and the sorcerer that find himself face to face with himself is a dead son cerer . That is the rule . That is the way powe has set things up . No one knows why . " Don Juan explained that by the time a warric had conquered " dreaming " and " seeing " an had developed a double , he must have also sta ceeded in erasing personal history , self-impo tance , and routines . He said that all the tecl niques which he had taught me and which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essenc means for removing the impracticality of havin a double in the ordinary world , by making th self and the world fluid , and by placing the outside the bounds of prediction . " A fluid warrior can no longer make the worl chronological , " don Juan explained . " And fc him , the world and himself are no longer object He 's a luminous being existing in a luminoi world . The double is a simple affair for a so cerer because he knows what he 's doing . ' I take notes is a simple affair for you , but yc still scare Genaro with your pencil . " " Can an outsider , looking at a sorcerer , al that he is in two places at once ? " I asked ( lc Juan . " Certainly . That would be the only way know it . " " But ca n't one logically assume that the sc cerer would also notice that he has been in places ? " " Aha ! " don Juan exclaimed . " For on you 've got it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has been in two places once . But this is only bookkeeping and has bearing on the fact that while he 's acting he h no notion of his duality . " I felt that if I did not keep on writing would explode . RINK OF THIS , " he went on . " The world I does n't yield to us directly , the description ) f the world stands in between . So , properly peaking , we are always one step removed , and nir experience of the world is always a recolection of the experience . We are perennially . ecollecting the instant that has just happened , ust passed . We recollect , recollect , recollect . " He turned his hand over and over to give me he feeling of what he meant . " If our entire experience of the world is recillection , then it 's not so outlandish to conclude hat a sorcerer can be in two places at once . his is not the case from the point of view of is own perception , because in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , Las to recollect the act he has just performed , he event he has just witnessed , the experience e has just lived . In his awareness there is only single recollection . But for an outsider looking t the sorcerer it may appear as if the sorcerer acting two different episodes at once . The orcerer , however , recollects two separate single istants , because the glue of the description of me is no longer binding him . " Don Genaro examined me with curious eyes . " He 's right , " he said . " We 're always one imp behind . " He moved his hand as don Juan had done ; is body started to jerk and he jumped back on is buttocks . It was as if he had the hiccups and le hiccups were forcing his body to jump back . e began to move backward in this manner all le way to the end of the ramada and back . The sight of don Genaro leaping backward a his buttocks , instead of being funny as it could have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intense that don Juan had to strike me peatedly on the top of my head with his auckles . " I just ca n't grasp all this , don Juan , " I said . " I ca n't either , " don Juan retorted , shrugging s shoulders . " Neither can I , dear Carlitos , " don Genaro lded . My fatigue , the bulk of my sensory experitee , the mood of lightness and humor that preMed , and don Genaro 's clowning were too uch for my nerves . I could not stop the agita ) n in my stomach muscles . Don Juan made me roll on the ground until I id regained my calmness ; then I sat down facg them again . is the double solid ? " I asked don Juan after long silence . They looked at me . " Does the double have corporealness ? " I ked . " Certainly , " don Juan said . " Solidity , cortrealness are memories . Therefore , like everying else we feel about the world , they are enemies we accumulate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my solidity , the same way you have the memory of communicating through words . Thus you talked with a coyote and you feei me as being solid . " Don Juan put his shoulder next to mine and nudged me lightly . " Touch me , " he said . I patted him and then I embraced him . I was close to tears . Don Genaro stood up and came closer to me . He looked like a small child with shiny mischievous eyes . He puckered up his lips and looked at me for a long moment . " What about me ? " he asked , trying to hide a smile . " Are n't you going to embrace me , too ? " I stood up and extended my arms to touch him ; my body seemed to freeze on the spot . I had no power to move . I tried to force my arms to reach him , but my struggle was in vain . Don Juan and don Genaro stood by , watching me . I felt my body contorting under an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sulk because I had not embraced him ; he pouted and hit the ground with his heels , then both of them exploded into more roaring laughter . The muscles of my stomach trembled , making my , whole body shake . I told don Juan that my body was pulling rue to leave . 1 waved my hand to don Genaro . I did not want to give them time to make me change my mind . " Goodbye , don Genaro ! " I yelled . He waved back at me . Don Juan walked a few yards with me toward my car . " Do you also have a double , don Juan ? " " Of course ! " he exclaimed . I had at that moment a maddening thought . I wanted to discard it and leave in a hurry but something in myself kept on needling me . Over the course of the years of our association , it had become customary for me that every time I wanted to see don Juan I would just go to Sonora or central Mexico and I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take that for granted and it had never occurred to me until then to think anything of it . " Tell me something , don Juan , " I said , half in jest . " Are you yourself , or are you your dou-ble ? " He leaned over toward me . He was grinning . " My double , " he whispered . My body leaped as if I had been propelled by a formidable force . I ran to my car . " I was just kidding , " don Juan said in a loud voice . " You ca n't go yet . " Both of them ran toward my car as I was backing up . They were laughing and jumping up and down . " Carlitos , call me anytime ! " don Genaro shouted .
