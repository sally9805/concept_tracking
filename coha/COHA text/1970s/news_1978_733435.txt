txt Letters Social Security : The Tax-Exempt Rescuers To the Editor . Despite vats of printer 's ink spilled over the recent statesmanship of the Congress in " rescuing " the Social Security system , one small detail was generally overlooked , even by those who boggled at the huge sums the American middle class will pay for Social Security in the years ahead . The small detail is that the members of Congress who voted the new taxes happen not to be paying one red cent themselves toward Social Security . Why riot ? " Oh , we have our own pension system , so we do n't care to join Social Security . " Thus Congress  --  and millions of Government employees ? leave to the rest of us the burden of carrying out the national support system for the elderly . Well , the university where I work has its own plan , too . I pay 5 percent of my salary into it , and , like the Congress , I do n't " need " Social Security either . The same is true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unlike Government employees , they have to pay into Social Security in addition to their own retirement schemes . Someone has to support the retired  --  unless , that is , you work for the Government . The public has now been told that Social Security is not a vested pension plan in which benefits are proportional to contributions , but rather a general tax on all working Americans to support retired Americans . That being so , the Congress has committed the one unforgivable legislative sin by taxing other Americans for a general social purpose while exempting itself . In short , Representation Without Taxation . Tea was hurled into Boston harbor for no greater an injustice . I am personally glad to do my share , even if it means ? as it will  --  paying up to 10 percent or so toward both an M.I.T. pension and Social Security . But my willingness evaporates when the whole Government cosily exempts itself from this same responsibility . We are also told that someone will " study " for a couple of years this little anomaly . Translation : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after election time  --  and perhaps another election , and another . " I have a suggestion . All private institutions which , like Congress and the various bureaucracies , " have their own pension plans , " should insist henceforth on exercising the same option the Congress has chosen for itself . They should decline to take further part in Social Security until all working Americans are taxed equitably and equally , regardless of what other pension plans they belong to , for the same national social purpose . Five will get you 10 that no court will enforce against a university , corporation or union which demands equal treatment under the law an act that so transparently violates the spirit of both the Fifth and the 14th Amendments to the United States Constitution . Two will get you 20 that when everyone figures out the number that the Congress has done on them , no members of congress or a tiovernment employees ' union will continue to insist on placing greed or political blackmail ahead of equity by continuing to vote taxes without paying any themselves .

Of Federal Spending and New York 's Complaint // John Caltlwall Arms ' Tragedy ' To the Editor : Your Dec. 21 editorial on SALT was an excellent examination of the dilemmas facing the United States and the Soviet Union concerning their landbased missiles . While it would be nice to think that we could somehow remove all those MIRV 's , I fear that we slipped over that watershed without ever really seriously thinking about it , and it is extremely unlikely that we can return . In the same way , we are now slipping over the cruise-missile watershed . This time we are talking more about it , but the momentum is too strong . We are caught up in a tragedy , in which the United States is basically determined to remain ahead of the Soviet Union on strategic forces and the Soviet Union is determined to catch up and if possible become the leader . The SALT negotiations are simply one of the stages on which this drama is being acted out . JOHN AUSLAND Oslo . Dec. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. SALT delegation . The Conservationists To the Editor : While it is difficult to persuade the non-hunting public to tolerate hunters so long as The Times continues to print ( and illustrate ) non sequitur hostile mail letters Nov. 30 and Dec. 23 at least you should permit the record to be set straight on conservation , a word popularized in America by Gifford Pinchot ( a hunter ) after it had been used in Great Britain for half a century to describe " the wise use of renewable resources . " Forest , fish and wildlife management , including the hunting of game species and the protection of most other species  --  yes , Virginia , hunters , not Cleveland Amory , pay wardens ' salaries  --  are involved with conservation . Thoughtful hunters helped establish the National Audubon Society , the National Wildlife Federation and the Nature Conservancy , and we are still in the vanguard of their support . Furthermore , Field &; Stream and Forest and Stream ( our precursor ) have been running articles attacking water pollution , commercial hunting and abuse of forest lands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expansion ' of the National Park system ( where we ca n't hunt ) since the 1870 's . While we welcome the support of non-hunters on issues of common ground , we do not enjoy the charge of some that we are collectively bloodthirsty maniacs , nor can we allow their attempt to steal the good name of conservation for their own . Hunters are often more concerned with the perpetuation of nature than are the more casually committed scanners of nature magazines . Anti-hunters may find this ? an indigestible thought , but it 's true nonetheless . People who believe that no creatures should be killed , that no forests should be cut , that , in fact , the goldfinch that comes to their feeder this winter is the very same bird that visited them a decade ago should be called ultrapreservationists , radical environmentalists , unrealistic extremists , or residents of the twilight zone , but please , nlAkne do n't call them conservationists , They are not . GEORGE REIGER Conservation Editor , Field &; Stream New York , Dec. 23 , 1977 To the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article headlined " U.S. Aid to Northeast is Reported Gaining , " with the subheading " G.A.O . Study Disputes Notion That Region is Shortchanged in Favor of Sunbelt States . " The findings may well give readers a mistaken impression , and not only readers in New York . The G.A.O . report is a study solely of direct Federal aid to state and local governments , which , the G.A.O . notes , constitutes but 15 percent of Federal outlays in any year . The G.A.O . study excludes such important matters in our economy as Federal employment ( down by 24,000 in New York City in the last 10 years ) , public works and defense procurement . As the study concludes , " This report does not provide the total Federal expenditures impact on the State . " New York does well on grants-in-aid largely for two reason : As our state has many poor citizens , we get a great deal of public assistance money , and as we have not only a high incidence of poverty but singularly high taxes , we do well under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next tragic subway disaster , may I shoot a few flares in warning of the very shaky and perilous state in which the trains now find themselves as they careen dangerously between express stops , especially on the Seventh Avenue line ? Motormen who race these stretches in total disregard of track and wheel disengagement possibilities should . also be suspended . Cargoes are merely humans . To the Editor : The year-end agreement signed in Seoul appropriately exhibits American relations with South Korea which have now settled into a familiar pattern . This pattern consists of two interwoven strands : South Korea 's assertion of nationalism by disregarding all that is wise and prudent in its national interest , and of our State Department 's equally insistent assertion of its professional autonomy through insensitivity to all that is reasonable and decent in the councils of the concerned . To a large extent , urgency to bring Tongsun Park to the U.S. to testify derives from the state of the American alliance with South Korea , which is badly in need of repair . The agreement making him available to judicial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except to provoks more Congressional Ire . President Park may have scored a point with his countrymen by standing up to Uncle Sam . Apparently , Ambassador Richard L. Snider considers this a step in the direction of a " more balanced and equitable relationship . " Seldom has a big-brotherly ' magnanimity been more condescendingly displayed . South Korea 's reluctance to let Mr. - Park appear in an open forum is attributed to its wishes to spare itself formulas , which take these two factors into account . As our state declines economically it becomes entitled to more of the Federal payments available to the distressed . This is surely no cause tor celebration , and , just as surely , it tells us nothing about the over-all impact of Federal spending on our state . As I have argued before , and at length , we know that we do well on this particular 15 percent of the Federal budget aimed at helping the poor ; our complaint is with the other 85 percent of the budget . In my view , the way in which it is raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have made the distinction between hardware and software in Federal expenditure . In brief , we get welfare ; the more fortunate states get infrastructure . The impact of Federal expenditures on the economy of states and regions is emerging as a major issue of social policy . I would we might at the outset strive for a certain rigor in the way we discuss it . DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN U.S. Senator from New York Washington , Dec. 29 , 1977 Secret Word To the Editor : All this angry talk about ex-Mayor Beanie 's final clubhouse ploy amuses me . Some time after his election the Board of Elections dropped me a note , announcing that I was being dropped from the rolls and would have to reregister because I had not voted in the last election . I wrote back this sentence : " Who wanted to vote with that choice of bums ? " In return I received a onesentence note : " You have been reinstated . " SHEPARD RIFKIN New York , Jan. 3 , 1978 further embarrassments as a result of his public testimony , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these many months one can not help but wonder just how much more there is to know about that sordid affair or how much more embarrassment to spare for the Park Government . All that South Korea 's intransigence does is cover the hollowness of the myth that has long since exploded . President Park stands naked before the world , without the benefit of the proverbial fig leaf . It has been suggested that the agreement leaves intact the Congressional power to subpoena Mr. Park once he arrives on the American shores . The Congress would be able to use that power ; however , it would do so at the cost of making the United States appear acting in bad faith . This would be at variance with the high purpose of the Congressional investigation . Far better would it be if the Congress repudiated the agreement and requested the President to renegotiate another agreement in Seoul so that it will be possible to obtain Mr. Park 's Congressional testimony without a recourse to high-handed  --  or underhanded  --  means . ** HA YIN !
