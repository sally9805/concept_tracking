At 6 a.m. one day last week a pleasant young man with a neatly trimmed brown beard approached the twin 110-story towers of the World Trade Center in lower Manhattan . He was wearing heavy hiking boots , and on his back was a burnt-orange pack containing a long coil of bright blue nylon rope . A curious window washer asked the stranger what he was planning to do . " I 'm taking a walk , " he said casually . And then he proceeded to : straight up . <P> Averaging about two minutes a floor , George Willig , 27 , climbed steadily up the northeast corner of the great south tower . He moved with a touch of clat and a forthright manner that clearly indicated he knew what he was doing . An experienced mountain climber , Willig had been planning his adventure for a year . He had punctiliously taken a day of leave from his job as a designer for the Ideal Toy Corp. , and was utterly confident that he would make it to the top of his own private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Willig had designed two special T-shaped metal blocks that locked into a track used to guide the heavy scaffolding that carries window washers up and down the outside of the giant structure . He was roped to the blocks , and each of his boots rested in a strap that acted like a kind of stirrup . To go up a foot or so , Willig used a pulley system . He would move one block as high as he could reach and hoist himself up . Then he would unhitch the lower block , attach it above his head and repeat the whole procedure . <P> Spring Happening . By the time he had climbed about ten floors , Willig had created a cheerful springtime happening . Down below , spectators were flocking to cheer him on . Television crews arrived . And so did the cops , but they too became caught up in the spirit of the climb . A couple of cops mounted a window washers ' scaffold and rode along with Willig for half the way-close enough to be of help if he wanted any . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aid of some policemen who acted as Sherpas , Willig scaled the final difficult passage to the roof . The jubilant cheers of thousands of spectators and a triumphant cacophony of horns rose faintly to his ears from 1,350 feet below , and he saluted his admirers with a wave . Then Willig turned and fell into the burly arms of the law . He was fingerprinted and questioned , then booked on charges of criminal trespass , reckless endangerment and disorderly conduct . The city threatened to sue him for $250,000 in damages-citing the cost of mobilizing the police force , the trouble caused by the traffic jams , the price of a police helicopter that had hovered fretfully overhead . <P> Why had he made the ascent ? " It was a personal challenge , " he said , " a challenge to my ingenuity . " The trade building , Willig said , " was very appealing . Very vertical . " Confronted by his talent , temperament and instant popularity , New York City soon surrendered and canceled the $250,000 suit . Instead , said Mayor Abraham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $1.10-a penny for every floor .
