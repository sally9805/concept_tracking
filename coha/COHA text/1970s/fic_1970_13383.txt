( The stage of the proscenium opening should be raked at a high enough angle so that any floor movement or choreography can be seen from anywhere in the house . Throughout the auditorium may be five small platforms , covering the theater seats , with stairs or ropes or bridges for the actors to reach them . There is a balcony stage left and another stage right where the opera singers will stand and sing in spotlights when necessary . Coming out from the proscenium opening on both stage right and stage left are two platforms against the house walls , wide enough to hold ornate chairs and from four to eight actors each . On stage right platform , which should be lower than the height of the main stage but high enough that the audience can see heads and shoulders , are male actors , dressed in the costumes of kings , emperors , presidents , prelates , etc .

Qualities , forms , and distances change , but the law of work remains the constant factor to which qualities , forms , and distances serve only as signs .

SIMONE I 'm not offering myself as an example ; every life evolves by its own laws . But you might think about it .

SIMONE I intend to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going into the factories , I 'm going to study the relationship of the worker to his work . Modern science has lost its soul because it reasons only about conventional symbols  --  objects . They become objects by the fact that they are black marks on , white paper , but which are universal by virtue of their definition . There should be a new way of conceiving mathematics  --  a way that its theoretical and practical value would no longer be distinct , but would reside in analogies . In man 's struggle with the universe , symbols would thus be relegated back to their rank as mere instruments , and their real function would be revealed , which is not to assist the understanding but the imagination . Scientific work would thus be seen to be in fact artistic work  --  namely , the training of the imagination .

ONE There 's no work these days . SIMONE One of my best friends knows the director of the company . THREE What 's it like ? SIMONE I 'm glad to be working in a factory , but equally glad not to be compulsorily committed to it . It 's simply a year 's leave for " private study . " ( As the speech continues , the ensemble enters and combines with one another to become the factory and machines . Simone works at her machine , and the speed of her speech builds with the speed of her work . ) SIMONE If a man is very skilled , very intelligent , and very tough , there is just a chance , in the present conditions of French industry , for him to attain a factory job . . . . ( Her visitors become machine parts . ) SIMONE . . . which offers interesting and humanly satisfying work : even so , these opportunities are becoming fewer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women ! The women are restricted to purely mechanical labor  --  Nothing is required of them but speed . . . . ( The machines begin to work in earnest. ) p. 31 SIMONE When I say mechanical labor , do n't imagine that it allows for daydreaming , much less reflection or thought . No . No . The tragedy is that , although the work is too mechanical to engage the mind , it prevents one from thinking of anything else . If you think , you work more slowly : ( The machines slow down and are silent . ) BARITONE ( Sings ) Speed , speed , speed Speed , speed , speed Speed , or the sack Speed , do n't talk back Speed , speed , speed If you wish to feed . ( Speaks ) Hurry up , Simone , you made only six hundred yesterday . If you make eight hundred today , maybe I wo n't fire you . ( The machines abruptly speed again . ) SIMONE I still ca n't achieve the required speeds . I 'm not familiar with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naturally slow moving , my head aches , and then I have the peculiar inveterate habit of thinking , which I ca n't shake off . Believe me , they would throw me out if I was n't protected by influence . Theoretically , with the eight-hour day , one should have leisure , but really one 's leisure hours are swallowed up by a fatigue which often amounts to a dazed stupor . Also , life in the factory involves a perpetual humiliating subordination , forever at the orders of foremen . p. 32 THREE How can you stand the suffering ? SIMONE I do suffer from it , but I 'm more glad than I can say to be where I am . I 've wanted it for I-don't-know-how-many years . ( The ensemble slowly breaks up the giant machine and exits , but Simone continues to work as she speaks . ) SIMONE But I 'm not sorry I did n't do it sooner , because it 's at my age now that I can extract all the profit there is in the experience . Above all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find myself among real men  --  some good and some bad , but with real goodness or badness . Goodness , especially when it exists in a factory , is something real . The least act of kindness , from a mere smile to some little service , calls for victory over fatigue and the obsession with pay  --  all the overwhelming influences which drive a man in on himself . Thought then calls for an almost miraculous effort of rising above the conditions of one 's life . Because it 's not like at a university , where one is paid to think , or pretend to think . In a factory one is paid not to think . So , if you ever recognize a gleam of intelligence , you can be sure it is genuine . Besides , I really find the machines themselves highly attractive and interesting . ( As members of ensemble arrive very slowly with real machines which they carry or manipulate , Simone exits , as if in a trance . The ensemble members stare and work their machines as if the machines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old women pull the cord attached to one cherub . The belly opens and jewels made of jello and candy tumble out , showering the audience. ) @x ( Simone enters with materials for letter . As she speaks the ensemble works out math forms i.e. equations or symbols with their bodies . ) SIMONE I need a physicist . I really need a physicist . Dearest Brother , please ask a physicist in America the following question : Planck justifies the introduction quanta of energy by the assimilation of entropy to a probability ( Strictly , the logarithm of a probability ) : because , in order to calculate the probability of a macroscopic state of a system , it is necessary to postulate a finite number of corresponding microscopic states ( Discrete states ) . So the justification is that the calculus of probabilities is numerical . But why was it not possible to use a continuous calculus of probabilities , with generalized numbers instead of discrete numbers ( Considering that there are games of chance in which probability is continuous ) ? There would then have been no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried ? Planck says nothing about it . T does not know of a physicist here who could enlighten me . What do you think about this ? ( The ensemble recites theories , goes into the audience to lecture them . Each actor should make up his own outrageous theories or speculations . The ensemble says to each other and the audience : " What do you think about this ? " as they exit. ) p. 35 SIMONE Your reply about Planck did not satisfy me . Have you read St John of the Cross ? ( Blackout . Ensemble stays in auditorium aisles , walking back and forth resolutely with eyes closed , whispering : " You do n't interest me . " ) SOPRANO You do n't interest me . BARITONE You do n't interest me . SOPRANO I ca n't see you . BARITONE You ca n't see me . SOPRANO I look right through you . I look right through you because when I look , there is nothing there to see . BARITONE You do n't interest me . You do n't interest me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't interest me . ( Simone on stage . This is her inside now : it slowly comes out as the singers sing , she passes people ; as she passes them , she " fixes " on them . They feel it , and begin to reach out to her as if in a trance . They stop short of touching , but their eyes stay locked . ) CHORUS You have nothing for me . I walk right through you You do n't even bore me I 've never heard you SIMONE ( Into mike ) No one can say you do n't interest me , without showing grave cruelty and profound injustice to the uniqueness of the individual soul . ( The ensemble actors move up onto the stage and form moving human structures two and three people high. ) p. 36 SIMONE There is something sacred in every person . CHORUS There is something sacred in every person . SIMONE But it is not his person . CHORUS But it is not his person . Not his person ? Not his person ? But if not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if it is not his person ? SIMONE It is n't his personality . CHORUS How can we sell him . SIMONE It is n't his personality , the personality he carries in his person . CHORUS But that 's the package . SIMONE So much baggage . CHORUS Give me a good personality any day , and I can come with him in every way . SIMONE So much baggage . SOPRANO I agree with the chorus . SIMONE So much baggage . BARITONE I would n't mind for a while to carry the chorus for an extra mile . SIMONE Not his person , nor his thoughts that I do n't know . Not his person , nor the way his arms grow . Not his person , nor the way his eye is lit . Not his person , but the total sacredness of His presence . His presence that hurts us when we must do without it . p. 37 CHORUS His presence when we must do without King , Queen , father , father , mother , mother , sister , brother , friend , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to live without your other . SIMONE Personality : Personality is n't what 's sacred to me . Human personality means nothing to me . If it did , I could easily put out the eyes of anyone as Oedipus did his own . He still had exactly the same personality as before . I would n't have touched the person in him , I would only have destroyed his eyes . What is it ? What is it that prevents me from putting out that man 's eyes if I 'm allowed to do it and if I feel like doing it ? CHORUS Put out his eyes . Burn his thighs . Pull out his tongue . Put it in Washington where it belongs with the other rotting dungs of tongues . ( Simone addresses audience , while human pyramids made by the actors slowly revolve : ) SIMONE The whole of your being is sacred to me , each one of you . But you are not sacred in all respects . You are not sacred because of your long bright hair , or your thick wrists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or the twinkle in your knowing eye , or even because your thoughts do n't interfere with mine  --  none of these facts could keep me from hurting you without the knowledge that if I were to put out your eyes , your soul would be lacerated by knowing the pain , and the fact that harm was being done to you . p. 38 CHORUS At the bottom of your heart From the time you 're a babe Though you are miles apart From your people . . . DUET You expect . You expect . You expect . SOPRANO With the certainty and the light When the sperm entered the egg . BARITONE You expect to go on being remade As the first Ecstacy of the trinity You were made . ( Pyramids disassemble and ensemble goes into dance formations . ) CHORUS You were made You were made SOPRANO You were made in ecstacy BARITONE Lying down or standing up , SOPRANO Crossed horizons or against the G E BARITONE You were laid as you were made . CHORUS Ecstasy . Ecstasy . Ecstasy . SIMONE ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us that goes on indomitably expecting , in the teeth of all experience of crimes committed , suffered , and witnessed , that good . . . . CHORUS ( Softly ) Good . Good . SIMONE That good and not evil will be done to you . It is this faith above all that is sacred in every human being . p. 39 ALL Woo ! ( Begin to dance ) CHORUS ( Like a thirties musical ) This above all This above all , This above all , Learn to walk in higher heels This above all , Baby This above all Learn to walk like you own The world ( Simone exits . ) CHORUS Learn how to kick and fly Learn how to fly Without getting sick Learn how to throw away the stick What you do is shove it up their ass It 's especially good When they run out of gas And you want nerve To carry the verve And show those nipples Let them ripple This above all Get as tall as you can before The geese begin To step all over you and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it with a smile . I 'd walk a million miles For one of your Luckies My bucky little rag-time Son-of-a-bitch You witch This was the days before Gary Learned to switch his horse And cocaine was running a close Second to anyone 's opium dream , It 's a scream But this above all This above all , learn how To look like you 're tall . The fall is funnier . The fall is funnier when you fall Right off that wall Oh be tall . There might be a light Outside the gate , Do n't you see it . There might be a light Outside the gate , Do n't you see it . Let 's burn gin to that . We need a light to show We 're right , We 're right Because we know in the Bottoms of your cups That might ca n't conquer right , That might ca n't conquer right , etc . ( Softer under next two lines ) p. 40 BARITONE There is no war on . There is no war on . ( Blackout ) ( Series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the town are pounding huge stones with sledgehammers . ) SIMONE Why are you cracking the rocks ? ONE We have to . SIMONE Are you going to build a wall or a garden ? TWO We 're out of work . SIMONE What do you mean you 're out of work , you 're working harder than I do . THREE We have to do this or they wo n't give us unemployment checks . SIMONE Give me one of those and I 'll help you . ( She stands beside the men and though she 's slower , still works . Then all run to the next scene . ) ( In the factory . The workers are having a sit-in . They sit on the floor , arms linked and swaying , singing " The International . " Simone is there too , arms linked with the workers , between two men . Two men in charge of running the factory are conferring with one another as the song ends .

I 'm afraid that in this struggle that begins to look like the classic struggle between the conservatives and the innovators the value of life is being forgotten . The conservatives do not know what to conserve , and the innovators do not know what to innovate  --  VOICE Revisionists ! Traitorous revisionists ! SIMONE Please , I ask you to pay one more minute of attention . It 's true so far as we know it that Stalin 's lieutenant S M Kirov was murdered . But Stalin is using this crime as a tool against many comrades who fought and sacrificed many long years to bring Marxist-Leninist concepts into being . If he is allowed to continue unchecked in this " purge , " there will be no chance for the dictatorship of the proletariat , because all his brothers will have been eliminated resulting in the dictatorship of one man , Joseph Stalin . We must show him that there is a world of opinion , considered and humane opinion by his brothers in other countries that condemn his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cruel persecution  --  ONE Traitor ! She 's a Trotskyite . ( Some people walk out. ) p. 43 TWO The purge is just and moral . Those men were working with the Germans to overthrow Stalin and so are you . I denounce Simone as a Trotskyite ! THREE Get her . FOUR Beat her up . ( They move slowly toward her . ) FIVE Smash her mouth . SIX Do n't let her open it again . SEVEN Kill her . SIMONE I 'm not a Trotskyite , I belong to no party . I am against totalitarianism in all its forms . If this " purge " continues in Russia , Stalin will succeed in creating a monolithic totalitarian unity and it will be an end to Lenin 's ideals and an end to people 's democracy . EIGHT Get her .

I 'll never forget your kindness and your bravery . PIERRE Those Communist fanatics want to drive us into war . You know that during the general strike they were working on the side of management to prevent our strike !

FATHER ( A warm man with natural charm ) Safe journey and God bless , my son . SIMONE ( Enters shyly ) Excuse me , Father .

SIMONE I 'd like to speak to you about Christ . ( They freeze , walk in a circle . She hesitantly approaches him again . ) SIMONE After working in the factories , I finally understood affliction . I began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to rise above the physical affliction of my headaches . Then in a Chapel in Solesmes where I 'd gone to hear the Gregorian music at Easter I was able to listen to the music in spite of pain . By an extreme effort of attention I was able to get outside this miserable flesh , leaving it to suffer by itself , and I found a pure and perfect joy in the unspeakable beauty of the chanting and the words . During the time I was there I also met a young man , a messenger I think of him now , who introduced me to George Herbert 's poem " Love . " From then on whenever my headache would reach a painful crisis , I would recite this poem fixing all my attention on it , clinging with all my soul to the tenderness it enshrines . One day , while saying this poem with all my attention , Christ Himself came down and He took possession of me. p. 52 FATHER Did you see Him ? SIMONE No , it was the presence of love , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love which I have never sought and which I 'd never thought existed . FATHER My child , are you seeking Catholic instruction ? SIMONE I do n't wish Baptism . FATHER But that is complete union . SIMONE I prefer to stand at the door of the church . FATHER Then you 're still a long way from Christianity . ( Again they freeze , walk in a small circle , relax , and she approaches him again . ) SIMONE Every day before I go out to harvest I say the " Our Father " in Greek . I try to do this with the utmost attention and if I do , Christ comes nearer to me now than He did that first time . FATHER It gives me joy to see the light growing within you . ( They freeze , she kneels and says the Pater Noster in Greek , or any language the actress would like . Then she stands .

You 're confusing reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and most severe in your judgments on that which could touch you the most . p. 53 SIMONE I have to beware of you . Friendship and the power of suggestion is what I 'm most susceptible to . FATHER But Baptism is  --  SIMONE I do n't want to belong to any groups . I want to be invisible , so that I can move among all groups . I 'm suspicious of structures , and especially the structure of the Catholic Church , it has been totalitarian since the time of the Roman Empire . FATHER You 're still locked into the narrow philosophy of Spinoza . SIMONE I 'd never read any of the mystics till my love of Christ , but now I see that Dionysus and Osiris are an early form of Christ . The Bhagavad-Gita when read aloud is a marvelous Christian sound . Yes , even Plato was a mystic . I see the Iliad now as bathed in Christian light . FATHER Your early intellectual training and culture are keeping you from contemplating the true mysteries of the Church dogma . Baptism is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for bearing with me for so long . I 'd never really considered the problem of Baptism as a practical one before . I 'm sorry to withhold from you what would give you the greatest joy , but God has other uses for me . If I felt His command to be baptized , I would come running at once . For now I think God does n't want me in the Church , perhaps at the moment of death . . . p. 54 FATHER It 's my only concern that you stay in readiness . . . .

On screens and slides , on scrolls , that come down , from projections , etc. , we should see films and stills of people in their death agonies . ) SIMONE Bonjour , mon cher ami . It 's good to see you again . I had no idea how long it would take me to get to London . MAN Did you go to America ? SIMONE Only because I thought it would be a faster way to get here , so that I can be of service to France . It took much longer than I 'd hoped . p. 57 MAN Your parents ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separated from me . I 've come to offer you my services to work for France . I distributed one of the most important clandestine publications in the free zone , Les Cahiers du tmoignage chrtien . But when I was there , I was consoled by sharing the suffering of my country . I 've come back to offer my self , because France 's misfortunes hurt me much more at a distance than when I was there . Leaving was like tearing up my roots . But I only left in the hope that I could take a bigger and more effective part in the efforts , dangers and sufferings of this great struggle . I have an idea . MAN Perhaps you 'd like to explain it to the Captain ? CAPTAIN ( Enters and bows ) Mademoiselle . SIMONE I have an idea . CAPTAIN Bon , they are needed . SIMONE This idea will save the lives of many soldiers . CAPTAIN Bon . SIMONE Many needless deaths happen on the field due to the lack of immediate care , cases of shock , exposure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Please consider it seriously , I want to work in secret operations , preferably dangerous . CAPTAIN Perhaps you should speak to the major . ( Exits ) MAJOR ( Enters ) Mademoiselle . SIMONE I really believe I can be useful . I appeal to you as a comrade to get me out of this painful moral situation . A lot of people do n't understand why it 's a painful moral situation , but you certainly do . We had a great deal in common when we were students together . It gave me a real joy to learn that you have such an important position in London . I 'm relying on you . MAJOR We can certainly use your brilliant mind . You were first in your class . SIMONE I want action . Here 's the idea : create a special body of front line nurses . MAJOR Of women ? SIMONE ( Nods and hurries on ) It would be a very mobile organization and should always be at the points of greatest danger . MAJOR But the horrors of war at the front  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's imagination that one can regard any woman who is capable of volunteering for such work as being very probably capable of performing it . MAJOR But they risk certain death . SIMONE They would need to have a good deal of courage . They would need to offer their lives as a sacrifice . MAJOR But we have never put our women in such danger . That 's why we men leave for the front to defend our homes and families . SIMONE There is no reason to regard the life of a woman , especially if she has passed her first youth without marrying or having children , as more valuable than a man 's life All the less so if she has accepted the risk of death . MAJOR But how to regulate . . . SIMONE Simply make mothers , wives and girls below a certain age ineligible . MAJOR I 'm considering the idea . SIMONE The moral support would be inestimable . They would comfort the men 's last moments , they would mitigate by their presence and their words the agony of waiting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essential role played in the present war by moral factors . They count for very much more than in past wars . It 's one of the main reasons for Hitler 's successes that he was the first to see this . p. 60 MAJOR I believe you should explain this to the General . ( Exits ) ( General enters , only nods . ) SIMONE ( Exhorting ) Hitler has never lost sight of the essential need to strike everybody 's imagination ; his own people 's , his enemies ' , and the innumerable spectators . One of his most effective instruments has been the S S. These men are unmoved by suffering and death , either for themselves or for all the rest of humanity . Their heroism originates from an extreme brutality that corresponds perfectly to the spirit of the regime and the designs of their leader . We can not copy these methods of Hitler 's . First , because we fight in a different spirit and with different motives . But when it is a question of striking the imagination , copies never succeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of thought to propaganda for the rear , yet it is just as important at the front . At the rear , propaganda is carried on by words . At the front , verbal propaganda must be replaced by the propaganda of action . GENERAL What do you propose ? SIMONE A simple corps of women performing a few humane services in the very center of the battle  --  the climax of inhumanity  --  would be a signal of defiance of the inhumanity which the enemy has chosen for himself and which he also compels us to practice . A small group of women exerting day after day a courage of this kind with a maternal solicitude would be a spectacle so new , so much more striking than Hitler 's young S S fanatics . The contrast between these women and the S S would make a more telling argument than any propaganda slogan . It would illustrate with supreme clarity the two roads between which humanity today is forced to choose . p. 61 GENERAL Merci . A very good idea . We will think about it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do . ( Typewriter and mounds of papers are wheeled out . ) GENERAL Four copies of each as soon as possible . There 's a war on . ( Blackout . The old men pull the cord attached to their cherub and ashes , bones and plastic baby dolls shower the audience . ) ( Simone , with a mike on a high platform , addresses a crowd . As she speaks , lights begin to go off and on . Strange noises  --  gunshot . Bit by bit the people leave and take up sides to fight the war . ) SIMONE We 're in a conflict with no definable objective . When there is no objective , there is no common measure of proportion . Compromise is inconceivable . The only way the importance of such a battle can be measured is by the sacrifices it demands . From this it follows that the sacrifices already made are a perpetual argument for new sacrifices . There would never be any reason to stop killing and dying , except that there is fortunately a limit to human endurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to defy analysis . And yet the most perfect example of it is known to every so called educated man , but , by a sort of taboo , we read it without understanding . The Greeks and Trojans massacred one another for ten years on account of Helen . Not one of them except the dilettante warrior Paris cared two straws about her . All of them wished she 'd never been born . Its importance was simply imagined as corresponding to the deaths incurred and the further massacres expected . ( Lights flicker and go out . People crawl in aisles and over audience . Lights  --  flashing ; crying , running. ) p. 62 SIMONE This implied an importance beyond all reckoning . Hector foresaw that his city would be destroyed , his father and brothers massacred , his wife degraded to a slavery worse than death . Achilles knew that he was condemning his father to the miseries and humiliations of a defenseless old age . All of them were aware that their long absence at the war would bring ruin on their homes ; yet no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all in pursuit of a literal non-entity whose only value was in the price paid for it ! ( Silence  --  then the war begins again . ) SIMONE For the clear-sighted , there is no more distressing symptom of this truth than the unreal character of most of the conflicts that are taking place today . They have even less reality than the war between Greeks and Trojans . At the heart of the Trojan War there was at least a woman , and what is more , a woman of perfect beauty . For our contemporaries the role of Helen is played by words with capital letters . If we grasp one of these words , all swollen with blood and tears , and squeeze it , we find it is empty . ( Silence  --  then just breathing . Then war begins again . ) SIMONE Words with content and meaning are not murderous . When empty words are given capital letters , then men on the slightest pretext will begin shedding blood . In these conditions the only definition of success is to crush a rival group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When a word is properly defined , it loses its capital letter and can no longer serve either as a banner or as a hostile slogan . ( Screams . Someone is shot while pleading not to be . Silence ) p. 63 SIMONE It becomes simply a sign , helping us to grasp some concrete reality , concrete objective or method of activity . To clarify thought , to discredit the intrinsically meaningless words and to define the use of others by precise analysis  --  to do this , strange though it may appear , might be a way of saving human lives . BARITONE How like a woman to reduce war to semantics . SOPRANO How like a man to reduce war to mathematics . ( All the men are lying on stage or in aisles . The women drag their bodies to a pile on stage as Simone speaks . ) SIMONE My dearest brothers , lying twenty years in your hospital beds , you are privileged men . The present state of the world is reality for you . You are experiencing more reality in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at this moment killing and dying , wounded and being wounded . Because they are taken unaware . They do n't know where they are . They do n't know what is happening to them . People not in the middle of the war do n't know what 's real . But you men have been repeating in thought , for twenty years , that act which took and then released so many men . But you were seized permanently . And now the war is here again to kill millions of men . You are ready to think . Or if you are still not quite ready  --  as I feel you are not  --  you only have the thinnest shell to break before emerging from the darkness inside the egg into the light of truth . It is a very ancient image . The egg is this world we see . The bird in it is Love , the Love which is God Himself and which lives in the depths of every man , though at first as an invisible seed . p. 64 MAN Will you help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will no longer be inside . Space is opened and torn apart . ( Silence for a moment . In pain and twitching like the men , Simone 's voice at first mirrors migraine pain , but then rises above the pain through the speech . ) SIMONE The spirit throws the miserable body in some corner and is transported to a point outside space . Space has become an infinity . The moment stands still . WOMEN ( Singing , facing audience from stage or in position in aisles ) The moment stands still ! The moment stands still ! The moment stands still ! The moment stands still ! The moment stands still ! The silence is dense . Sounds Sounds Silence is . The whole of space is filled Not an absence of sound But the moment is filled With the secret word . Once you break out of your shell You will know what is real About war . You will know the secret word You never knew before , Not the absence of sound But love , love , love , love , love . SIMONE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but a positive object of sensation . ( Singing ) You , when you 've emerged From the shell Will know the reality of war . The most precious reality to know Is that , war is unreality itself . ( Speaking ) You are infinitely privileged . War has permanently lodged in your body . p. 65 WOMEN ( Singing ) War is affliction , Fortunate are you to know SIMONE War is affliction . It is n't easy to direct one 's thoughts toward affliction voluntarily . To think affliction , it 's necessary to bear it in one 's flesh , driven very far in like a nail , and for a long time , so that thought may have time to grow strong enough to regard it . WOMEN ( Singing ) War is affliction , Fortunate are we to know . Fortunate are we . War is affliction . Fortunately we can not see it . War is affliction . SIMONE You have the opportunity and the function of knowing the truth of the world 's affliction . Contemplate its reality ! ( Men rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Simone begins to move through them , climbing ever higher on the platforms . ) MAN ONE Eat , Simone . ( She shakes her head and moves up ramp . ) MAN TWO Eat , Simone . ( She shakes head and climbs to highest platform . She 's weak and must hold onto the bars to stand up . A woman mounts an auditorium platform and mechanically intones . ) WOMAN DOCTOR ( At an inquest , British accent ) I tried to persuade Simone to take some food , and she said she would try . She did not eat , however , and gave as a reason the thought of her people in France starving . p. 66 ENSEMBLE ( Whispers over and over ) Strange suicide . WOMAN DOCTOR She died on the twenty-fourth of August , and death was due to cardiac failure due to degeneration through starvation . BARITONE ( Singing , as a judge ) Simone , aged thirty-four , committed suicide by starvation while the balance of her mind was disturbed . ( Chorus speaks ) WOMEN Strange suicide . Strange suicide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Strange suicide . MEN Refused to eat . MEN &amp; WOMEN ( As lights begin to dim on ensemble ) She refused . She refused . She refused . WOMAN ONE She would n't eat . She would n't eat the bombs of the Germans , she would n't eat the furnaces of the Nazis . She swallowed the pride of France , but it did n't stick to her ribs . CHORUS Strange , strange , strange , strange , strange  --  Simone would n't eat . Simone would n't eat . WOMAN TWO Her soul was full , she did n't have to eat . There 's no such thing as a personality . There 's no such thing as a mind when the body dies . The mind can die before the body dies . p. 67 WOMAN THREE She would n't eat . She would n't eat . She could n't eat when others starved . She would n't eat while Hitler carved the meat of her countryside . WOMAN FOUR While everyone else lived on spoiled cabbage leaves and boiled rainwater , Simone ate nothing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have been . What a tiny coffin they must have buried her in . ( Pin spot on Simone , dimming slowly , slowly , slowly , slowly to black . ) ( END OF PLAY. )
