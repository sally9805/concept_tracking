Nick 's hair is gray now . His shoulders are slumped ever so slightly . He runs one of the supermarkets in our town and when I first met him  --  after church on our first Sunday in town  --  he was tall and straight with jet black hair and glowing eyes . But he 's spent these last few years in the firestorm of revolution  --  the revolution of changing American food demands . The crosscurrents  --  indeed , the riptides  --  of these changes have elevated , inspired , baffled , and sometimes wearied the men and women who , like Nick Tomei , run the 208,000 retail food stores in the nation . It 's also deeply affected the people who produce and process the food . And it 's given a new sense of purpose and reward to those who brought about the revolution : the housewives and food-buying public of the nation . The evidence of the change they 've wrought is visible everywhere , from the research labs of major food processors to the shelves of the neighborhood supermarket . Consider the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are organic foods  --  agar-agar , blackstrap molasses , carob powder , kelp , granola , gruenkern , and goat 's milk . There are ethnic foods  --  Italian , Greek , French , Mexican , soul . There are easy-tocook foods  --  heat-and-eat , shake-and-bake , toteand-toast , brown-and-serve , boil-in-a-bag . There are , in fact , nine times as many different items in the average food store as when Nick was a boy : back in 1928 , the average retail food store carried only 867 different items , while in 1972 it carried 7,950 . The swiftly increasing scope and complexity of the modern supermart  --  indeed , of the whole food industry  --  is a response to the changing demands of the consumer in recent years . Some of the changes are obvious , such as the rising popularity of ethnic , organic , and convenience foods . Other changes were more subtle and so were the reasons behind them . Perhaps nobody has defined them more profoundly than Dr. Paul A. Fine , head of the Paul A. Fine Associates research group , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was happening in the great American food revolution . He presented some of his findings to the American Medical Association and its Food Science Council in November , 1971 . They included such percipient insights as : Breakfast is rapidly becoming a thing of the past . For generations , girls grew into housewives on the admonition that " breakfast is the most important meal of the day " and " never send a man out without a hearty meal under his belt in the morning . " The hearty meal figured to be juice and cereal or pancakes as a starter , then ham , bacon , sausage , or sometimes steak , witheggs or home-fried potatoes as the main course , followed or accompanied by something sweet  --  a sweet roll , a cinnamon roll , toast and jelly  --  and a large glass of milk . " Today , " says Dr. Fine , " that kind of breakfast is eaten most often only on Sundays , if then . We estimate that probably no more than 25 percent of U.S. households have anything approaching this kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ housewife . She does n't have to get up and cook ; she has to find mittens , change diapers , unknot shoelaces , get the galoshes on the kids , and perhaps drive for the car pool . Not to mention the possibility that she has to get out to work herself . On top of this , there is no set time for breakfast when everybody will meet for their " hearty meal in the morning . " Various members of the family get up and out at various times in the morning , from six-thirty until after eight o'clock . Since timing is of the essence in making breakfast  --  there is nothing worse than having soggy eggs or cold sausage or bacon  --  she 'd have to be a short-order cook for ninety minutes to two hours every day to give everybody " the most important meal of the day . " Moreover , she does n't have anybody to help her in getting a piping hot meal on the table in the morning . " She can demand and get help at dinner , " observed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teenage daughter who ' ca n't get my hair right ' to help in the morning ? " The result is that breakfast has become  --  in Dr. Fine 's word ? " individuated . " Everybody eats what he wants and skips what he does n't want : " Even small children are allowed to select their own cereal . " T - reit elders do n't often get as much nourishment " Coffee , juice , and a couple of vitamin pills aie standard breakfast fare for a great many adult : . , , " said Dr. Fine . The unplanned , disorganized na . ure of all this leaves the housewife very ups.it ; she thinks she should be in control of things and she worries that perhaps the members of her family are n't getting enough nourishment through this anarchic system . But she compensates ft r it by conceding that there 's not enough time to gel breakfast for everybody and " at least they ' re getting something into them . " The " main meal , " where the family ga hers to sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also in decline . This also is very upsetting to many a housewife , for she 's been brought up to regard this main meal as almost " sacred " . In certain cultures , if a person is absent from the " sacred " meal , a seat is left vacant to symbolize his presence ; in primitive societies , the preserved skulls of ancestors are actually " fed " on important occasions . Even in modern industrial America , high business executives feel compelle I to get home for dinner ? " it 's the only time I over see the kids " - even if it means continuing ill ( it work after dinner , late into the night . The hart fact is that if he does n't get home for dinner  --  if he goes out to dinner with a business acquaintance  --  he // does n't feel the impact of his absence as much as his wife does . For it is usually the wife and mother who feels the need for punctuating the day by having everybody gather around the dining table ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be upset by its gradual decline and disappearance . For Dr. Fine estimates that-in contrast to the seven-day-a-week ideal for main-meal consumption-it usually happens only three days a week . And then the " main meal " may last for as little as twenty minutes . The reason is that in modern America , many husbands do n't get home from work until after the smallest children have gone to bed ; other fathers and some sons are going to night school , the grade-school kids are at Little League or hockey , even the mothers may be off to Garden Club or the PTA meeting . There 's another factor : the time available for cooking the main meal has become increasingly limited , either because so many women today are working or because they 're immersed in the kinds of social and civic activities that keep them busy until evening . This is an irony , for as the horizons of food preparation are expanding , the time available to the woman to pursue them , through complex cookery , is declining . At the same time , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her time by demanding that she serve their " favorite " food . Thus the habit she tolerates in the morning- " individuated " meals picked up according to each individual 's taste-returns to plague her in the evening , when she has no time or inclination to make individual meals to please everybody 's palate . So she compromises : she develops a few menus with the " lowest common denominator " - with those foods that will satisfy all or most of the members of her family-and she serves them over and over again . " Some women appear to operate on as few as seven basic meals which are rotated with unswerving calendrical authority , " said Dr. Fine . " Most seem to use ten to fourteen basic meals with the rare ' experiment ' thrown in . " But the fact that the meals are the lowest common denominator tends to make the main meal less attractive to some members of the family ; they prefer to get their tastes satisfied by meals outside the home . Thus the structure of the main meal is weakened even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself might disappear . Almost half the time , the wife and mother is n't directly involved in the choice of the foods that her family eats . Some 40 percent of the money spent on food these days is spent for food consumed outside the home . Consider the frequency of outside eating : at coffee breaks during work-when many persons eat " breakfast " - or at the desk in the early work hours ; at school during recess or lunch ; after school in the local kids ' hangout ; and at business lunches or business dinners where the husband may eat so much-on an expense account , of course-that he feels he 's had his main meal of the day . Thus the total picture : while breakfast at home is disappearing , lunch at home is nonexistent , and the main meal , dinner at home , is in decline , the response of many people is-in Dr. Fine 's view-to get their individual tastes " fulfilled away from the main meal " and thus away from home . With so much eating away from home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intake of her family-and by implication the health of her family-is diminishing . Behind all this , Dr. Fine discerned yet another revolutionary change in eating habits : Americans no longer get " three square meals a day " in the historical tradition of the nation . Instead they have one meal a day-a meal that starts with juice and vitamins in the morning and continues through coffee breaks , snacks , TV watching , and before-bed gnawing with only an occasional interruption for ( a ) breath , and ( b ) a recognizable menu . To the housewife , all this offers the problems of high calories and no nutrition-she 's been taught that snacks are " junk " foods . ( Some are , in fact ; some are n't . ) So she . worries all the more : her family is going to get fat and have malnutrition at the same time . The import of all of this is that she feels she 's being frustrated in her womanly responsibilities : that of delivering health as well as food to her family . For everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to nutrition and nutrition is the key to health-ergo , food is the key to health . Yet the revolution in eating patterns has demolished everything she 'd ever come to understand about the patterns of good eating-and thus the pursuit of good health . " In a sense , " said Dr. Fine , " she feels that the future of the world is supposed to be in her hands and yet it escapes her constantly . " Among her responses-in the views of some persons-was to turn , in her anxiety , to the ethnic foods of her mother 's generation and to theorganic and " natural " foods of the younger generation . The ethnic foods were something of an emotive anchor ; they were something she was sure that all the members of her family would eat and their food value had been impressed on her by her mother and her mother 's mother . The organic foods of the younger generation promised more nutrition and " meaning " than processed foods , even though they cost a great deal more ; moreover , they gave her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she might have felt-were n't providing everything she wanted in the way of ideal food consumption for her family . Nowhere was the revolution in eating habits demonstrated more dramatically than in the turn to organic and " natural " foods . Rooted for years in fading farm , and mom-and-pop city business , " health foods " began booming in the late 1960 's as part of the " youth " reaction against the status quo . By 1970 , they were a $100 million-a-year business : by 1972 , they 'd quadrupled-they were a $4.00 million-a-year business . The number of health food stores increased from 1,800 in 1968 - when the fad was already rolling-to well over 3,500 in 1972 . The products they were putting on the shelves seemed to be multiplying like gerbils . Not long ago , just one large store , the Natural Foods Center operated by the Berkeley , California , food co-ops , offered 23 different kinds of nut butter , 80 different brands of herb tea , 50 different " natural " cheeses , and 110 different flavors , blends and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the counterculture , will protect you from everything from arthritis to itchy palms ) . And the prices were as expansive as the number of products . Vitamins , wheat germ oil , garlic capsules , and dessicated liver tablets were selling at markups of 100 to 300 percent of what they cost at wholesale . Wild honey shampoo began selling at $15.80 a pint , organic natural shoes cost $35 , and wheat-germ-and-yeast beauty mask marketed at $5 ? just in case you wanted to absorb " health " through your skin instead of your mouth . In April , 1972 , the Journal of Milk and Food Technology reported on a comparison of twenty-four health foods with twenty-four traditional foods and found the health foods sold at 70 percent more than the traditional foods . The reason is suggested by the one-time TV manufacturer who decided to open a health food store in the chic upper East Side of Manhattan . It cost him , he said later , $50,000 to make the place look like a barn . At the outset , the health foods drive was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two things happened . One was that the " revolution " began falling into the hands of the establishment . When Archon Pure Products was formed in 1970 to market health foods nationally , it boasted such backers as Clare Boothe Luce , Robert Sarnoff , chairman of RCA , the Rockefeller brothers , the Rothschilds , and some partners from Lehman Brothers , an old-line investment banking firm . The other thing that happened is that some exploiters began moving in  --  even on the counterculture  --  with extravagant claims about what health foods , and excesses of vitamins , could do for you . Milk could cure cancer , honey could prevent arthritis , vitamin E could help everything from the sex drive to protection against air pollution , and a brown-rice-and-nuts diet  --  the macrobiotic diet  --  could protect its proponents from an atomic bomb . ( " A macrobiotic person can not be killed by an atomic bomb , " said the late Georges Ohsawa , the leading philosopher of the diet . ) Once the exploiters began moving in , how did the food processors respond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of eating and the changing tastes of the American food buyer ? Some of them began marketing " natural " foods to augment their traditional products : Quaker Oats has a " natural " breakfast cereal , for example . Some of them have gone heavily into the heat-and-serve convenience dishes ? " if you ca n't warm it and serve it in twenty minutes , forget it , " says one housewife . Almost all of them are going into the production of a greater variety of food products in recognition of the greater range and location of food consumptionKraftco , which has a general renown as a maker of cheese products , actually markets some 6,000 food and non-food items worldwide . But the responses to the innovative demand  --  the processes and techniques  --  can only be measured by taking a close and comprehensive look at what one company is doing . Let 's take Kraft-co . As one of the largest food processors in the world ( it grosses some $3 billion a year ) , what it does inevitably influences what the whole world of food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone , " says William 0 . Beers , the forceful , sturdily built chairman of Kraftco 's board . " We'redealing with people and their ideas . " The ideas are rooted in the way that people express their preferences in food . Historically , the food processors watched sales for the expression of those ideas . Coffee-flavored ice cream sells well in the northeast  --  say Kraftco executives  --  but not in the rest of the country . Mayonnaise sells well on both the East and West Coasts but Miracle Whip  --  a product that looks like mayonnaise but is actually a salad dressing with a tangier zip  --  sells better in the Midwest . Barbecue sauce sold better on the West Coast and in the Southwest before it hit hard in the rest of the country , and yogurt also sold well on the West Coast before it spread to the rest of the country . " On the whole , the West Coast tends to be a forerunner of national trends , " says William H. Mallory , director of market research for Kraftco . By watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea of what the food-buying public will seek next , on a national scale . It can hope to do the same by watching the mail : Kraftco normally receives between 5,000 and 30,000 requests per month for recipes , but some months the requests have totaled 50,000 . By watching the trend in these requests it can discern some of the current drives in taste . But now Kraftco is turning to in-depth interviews involving thousands of families . We 're trying to get the housewife into the picture at an earlier stage , " says Bill Mallory . " What are her ideas ? How isshe changing ? How are her needs changing ' How can we meet those changing needs ? " It is up to Kraftco to trace the answe s and then to take action on them . Once a potential answer is discovered , it is delivered to the company 's Research &; Development headquar ers in Glenview , Illinois . This is a spare , spotless structure built around atriums  --  or inner court , ardson a suburban road some twenty-five miles northwest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything from the basic structure of food ? " We 're finding components in it that we did n't know existed a few years ago , " says R &D; director John White  --  to the total passage of food as it 's converted from a raw m to a body element . ( " We can tag a single element of a particular food with a radioactive isotope , " says John White , " and trace its progress i11 the way from the production process in ou - pilot plant through the digestive system of our aboratory animals . " ) Thus Kraftco 's R &D; is eq sipped not only for a searching examination of the food idea itself , but the systems of change that process and manufacturing might bring to it . The first step at R &D; is to examine the way the product might be used in the home , then to develop a formula that meets that use  --  a formula involving all the ingredients in the ultirnat : product . Every ingredient in that formula is examined for its nutritional value and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for use now and in the future . Thereafter , everything that happens to that food product  --  no matter how it 's cooked , stored , altered , or processed  --  will go into the computer so that a continuing analysis can be maintained of the nutritive value of the product . This is clearly a response to the concerns of the modern-day housewife about the nutritional value of the nonstop , nonstructured eating patterns that her family indulges  --  as well as to the imperatives of the U.S. government . For the government is requiring that , as of January I , 1975 , any product for which a nutritive benefit is claimed or to which a nutrient has been added must have all the nutritive benefits of the product listed clearly on the label . Indeed , the government now requires that many food products  --  TV dinners among them  --  carry certain minimum quantities of nutrients . More than that , it demands that certain foods be enriched with nutrients useful to the consumer . The amount of iron added to flour has been tripled recently and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addition , the mandatory levels of the vitamins thiamin , riboflavin , and niacin have also been increased . Today , four slices of enriched bread ( or close to four ounces ) will provide a young woman with all her daily calcium needs , with 15 percent of her protein needs , with 24 percent of thiamin , 19 percent of niacin , and 13 percent of riboflavin . While all of this is going on , the Kraftco R &D; researcher is exploring all the likely alternatives to the original formula . He may want to add a little more spice here , a little more sauce there ; he may want to reduce the pasta a bit and build up the vegetable content . " As you go along , it 's inevitable that there will be changes applied to the original concept , " says John White . Some of those changes are very subtle ones involving taste and texture . " Individuals have an amazing capacity for picking up the nuances of taste ; we still have not improved on the human palate as a way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those subtleties of taste are extremely important and vary from country to country . In several foreign countries , Kraftco sells products designed to suit the particular taste preferences of the country . In Germany a catsup flavored with curry , special sauces for meats , different types of cake mixes and a nutritious chocolate snack for children are manufactured and sold to appeal to the tastes of Germans . Australians are fond of a yeast product called " Vegemite . " One Kraft Foods Division official estimated that the product is found in about 90 percent of all Australian homes . Efforts to market it in the United States have failed because the product has a very salty taste and a peculiar smell which Americans find offensive , but the Australians find appealing . Other foreign countries where Kraftco markets products will also have special items found nowhere else but in that country . In all of this , the Kraftco researchers are examining just how to add and mix these elements . In fact , they 've already been analyzing the ideal methods for adding or preserving the nutrients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is aware of how the systems of manufacturing and processing can impact on the food value of a product : " We make every effort not to destroy or reduce the value of the nutrients that are in the raw materials , " says John White . In some cases , if any nutrients are lost in processing , efforts are made to restore the food to its original nutritional value . This is a very careful , complex precaution , for the food must go through high temperatures , through pressing and processing , through refrigeration procedures  --  through all the stresses and strains that any substance must endure before it is perfected for mass production . Even the final mass-production processes are to be analyzed , questioned , and appraised to make sure that they are thoroughly susceptible to quality control . ( In one Kraftco plant , which processes 2.86 million pounds of food a day , every aspect of the plant 's production is checked continuously by everything from computers to microbiological samples to the human mouth . " We taste a lot but we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member of one quality control lab . ) Beyond all this , Kraftco wants to make sure that the production process wo n't pollute the environment ? " We 're not , " says John White , " going to produce a great and healthful food item for our consumers and then pollute their environment while doing it . " Even when all this is known , the search for perfection in the product goes on . For example : In one lab there is a series of devices that reveal what happens to the product when it is shipped by truck or rail . One device is a jostling machine , which duplicates what happens to the product  --  perhaps a salad oil , or a mayonnaise ? " as it 's being jostled along on a truck for a givennumber of miles . " Another is an impact machine , which duplicates the smashing and bumping that a carton of Kraftco products might endure in being shipped by rail  --  what will happen to it as it is bumped back and forth on a highway crossing or as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another is a device which duplicates conditions at the various elevations in the United States  --  from mile-high Denver to below-sea-level Death Valley  --  so that the changes in the product due to various air pressures can be determined before the product emerges from the lab . In another lab there is nothing but a number of refrigerator cases and shelves , just as they appear in your local supermart  --  under exactly the same conditions of lighting . That is exactly the point : to find out what will happen to a product when it 's exposed for long periods to supermarket conditions , including the effects of light in its visible and invisible manifestations . ( " We 're looking particularly hard at the action on the ultraviolet end of the spectrum , " says John White . ) In yet another lab , more than 100 different kinds of wrappings are mounted on horizontal spindles sticking out from a wall . Kraftco has always been a leader in perceiving the importance of the packaging of a product in terms of its usefulness to the housewife . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wide mouth , for example ? " so the housewife can get the spoon all the way down to the bottom of the jar to get the last of the mayonnaise or dressing out , " says Chester Green , the company 's top vice-president in marketing and research . In this lab , the packaging principle does not embrace glass so much as various kinds and thicknesses of polyethylene film wrappings . " Some of them are ideal for sealing , " says John White . " Others are best for preventing moisture loss , still others for preventing gas transmission " - the infiltration of air which might reduce the quality of the food . This is why Kraftco uses laminations of several wrappings-not one thick wrapping-to protect certain of its products : through the laminations it gets the best of all possible actions . It also provides for a wrapping that the housewife can open without using hammers or dynamite-a wrapping that can continue to be used by the housewife when she puts the product in the refrigerator . For Kraftco 's concern is not just in selling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delivering the best possible product to the consumer in every stage from innovation to complete consumption . That 's why it wraps its Cracker Barrel cheese in a five-ply lamination-so that the wrapping can serve all the scientific needs for food protection , yet be easy to open and thereafter serve as a ready instrument to protect the food while it 's in the family refrigerator . The idea that 's being turned into a food product must go through profound testing in these and in many other labs at the Kraftco R &D; headquarters . When it 's passed all its tests in these labs , it still must survive several more tests on the outside . Among those are the tests in the Kraft Kitchens . These are a congerie of eight kitchens set in an enclave of warm woods and soft pastels on the sixth floor of an austere office building that was once a production facility hard by Chicago 's downtown lakefront . These kitchens are designed to duplicate in every possible detail the actual kitchen work in various phases of " the outside world " - i.e. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lab . One kitchen duplicates all the activity of a fast-food service facility , complete with deep fryers and steam ovens . Another duplicates a suburban outdoor grill , complete with a charcoal bed and brick linings . Still others are much like those you 'll find in any home or apartment except that they offer a wider choice of cooking possibilities-with gas , or with electricity , or in a microwave oven , for example , It is not just the equipment that is identical to that being used in the home ; it is that the lighting and decor and " move-around " space are virtually identical to that in the home kitchen . There is one exception : the Research Kitchen does not have bright colors on its walls or fixtures ; they are of beige or soft off-whites and the overhead lighting is white and neutral . ( " We wanted to eliminate colors which would reflect off certain foods and perhaps inspire a subjective judgment based on how the foods looks rather than an objective one based on how it tastes and ' handles , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relations for Kraft Foods . ) There are twenty-two home economists- " housewives " working in this area and every year they test and examine some 1,200 different products to see how they 'll work in the kitchen - at home or in a restaurant-as well as how they act and react in the lab . Not all of these are new or modified products ; some of them are old products with a new urgency . But some idea of the stringency and care of Kraftco 's research and development might be achieved by taking that figure and comparing it with the forty new products that Kraftco actually put on the market in 1972 i.e. , that one idea in every thirty gets past the Kraft Kitchens and onto the supermarket shelves ( or , if you want to conform to new-product testing exclusively , cut the ratio in half , one idea in every fifteen ) . The examination an idea gets in the Kraft Kitchens , and the way the home economists work with research labs personnel , is suggested by a new product which hit the supermarket shelves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ margarine and it was thought to be very convenient for the general use of margarine in the kitchen-substituting easy pouring for constant cutting-as well as for special uses with certain foods ( to pour on popcorn , spread on corn on the cob , or top pancakes or wheatcakes with , all of which are best when the traditional solid margarine-or butter-has melted to a liquid ) . But it was n't enough simply to melt margarine and package it in a plastic bottle instead of a paper carton . That simply would n't work at all . For to be useful in the kitchen , liquid margarine had to meet a great many practical tests . For example , it had to be smooth and somewhat thick , or creamy , in order to " set up " well on the food it might be used with . On the other hand , it had to be " thin " enough to flow readily out of a small spout , one with an opening , say , a sixteenth of an inch in diameter . That was just one specification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liquid that was thin enough to flow readily out of a small spout . Now add a complication : refrigeration . The margarine would have to be refrigerated , whether in the supermart or later in the home . That means that it would get cool and as it cooled , the liquid would tend to harden . Not to " freeze , " in a literal sense , but simply to get a little firmer and more solid . But that meant it would n't flow out of the spout when it was taken from the refrigerator ; it would be like trying to force solid butter through a small spout . Both the home economists in the Kraft Kitchens and the white-coated researchers in the R &D; labs could see the i mph-cations of this : one or two fri.strations with nonflowing liquid margarine- or episodes of impat ence while waiting for the margari ie to soften enough to become " ) ourable " - meant the housewife v ould never buy the product again . St now the research team , including the Kraft Kitchens experts , had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as one which wot Id be preserved perfectly in a refrigs rator without hardening to an " unpourable " state . All these contradic tions had to he worked out scientifically in the R &D; labs and then p-oven practically in the Kraft Kitc hens . And these problems were link ed inextricably with others- with t ie design of the spout and seal , for oxample ; and with the very design if the bottle ( it had to be designed no only for looks and for a woman 's hand-grip but to enhance the flow ) f the margarine when the bottle is near empty , so that the housewife is not gypped out of the use of the bottom ounce of the margarine ) . Altogether , almost five years of research a nd of testing-at both R &D; and Kraft Kitchens-went into liquid I arkay margarine before it was deemed ready for the supermarket . The effort was worth it : in a very short while , liquid Parkay margari became one of the rising new " si of supermarket sales . Beyond the Kraft Kitchens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea-t Arnedinto-product must survive . It s with the housewives of the country who will use the products . For K - aftco , like many other food processors , tests new products with the %/omen who 'll have to use them . The results develop insights that are sometimes invaluable . Not too long ago . several food processors developed sistems for spreading cheese on crack 3rs and bread by " squeezing " the package instead of spreading with a knife . Nabisco was one of the first i ' Ito the field with a system that involved a cheese spread in a can and squeezed out through a narrow nozz e with the aid of an aerosol valve . 1:raftco decided to try to eliminate b ) th the aerosol valve and the can-bo . h costly items-and thus lower t le cost while keeping the cheese quality high . Instead of the can , it developed a plastic wrapping that looked much like a sausage . Instead of tie thin nozzle and aerosol valve , it provided a wide opening in the plasti. : casing that would be closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whirl would look and feel somewhal in the packaging but which w.i ill soft and " flowable " enough a. : room temperature so that it could be squeezed by hand-through the opening .

Everything seemed to work perfectly in the labs and then in the Kraft Kitchens . In both instances , the persons working with the spread were well aware that the cheese spread did n't have to be kept refrigerated . When the product was put out for test marketing , Kraftco quickly discovered a stumbling block : the everyday user of the cheese was n't aware that the cheese spread did n't have to be kept refrigerated . And she did n't seem to notice that fact as it was spelled out on the labeling . The housewives in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for generations : they put the cheese in the refrigerator ?

So she 'd likely hand it to her husband and ask him to squeeze it out the opening ? " and he was so strong that he 'd squeeze hard enough to pop the cheese out the end of the package , " says William Mallory . This was reported back promptly to Kraftco 's researchers , who went to work to overcome that flaw . The plastic package was strengthened to prevent popping-at-the-end , the openingand-seal was redesigned to make it more efficient under these more strenuous conditions , the labeling was changed to make it even clearer that no refrigeration was needed , and the cheese process was altered ever so slightly so that the cheese spread would remain somewhat " squeezable " even if the housewife succumbed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to the market as " Squeez-A-Snak " and rapidly carved an appropriate place for itself in the marketplace . " Which would not have been possible without the ' playback ' from the homemakers , " says Mallory . This playback , this dialogue between food buyer and food processor , is a vital part of the Great American Food Revolution . There are those who claim that the food processors are not listening  --  that they are going their own way and imposing their will on the people . The evidence is in the supermarket , not only in terms of more food and more modern food  --  i.e. , organic and natural foods  --  but also in more subtle ways . One of them is in the dating of food in ways that are clear to the consumer as well as the food processor ; today it is possible for the housewife in the family to find a date on most food products which will tell her whether it 's fresh or not . Kraftco , like certain other food processors , regards this as a " pull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must pull the product off the shelf . In 1972 , Kraftco pulled about $18 million worth of food off supermarket shelves , not because they were in any way dangerous but because they 'd passed that moment of consistent and peak quality that Kraft-co , in this era of consumer consciousness , demands of itself . The supermarket is the place where all this becomes apparent as part of the firestorm of revolution in eating habits . But there is more than food involved in the revolution . The evidence is in the many nonfood roles that the supermarket now plays in American life . The supermarket operator today operates a check-cashing service for housewives ( " wo n't you please cash this check for ten dollars over the food bill ? " ) , and a rental service ( everything from party glasses to rug shampooers ) , and a nonfood store ( he sells everything from pantyhose to paperback books ) , and even a waste disposal service ( he may give away cardboard cartons to his customers but he has plenty more left : John 0 . Whitney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ super-mart in his chain disposes of eight tons of cardboard and packaging every week ) . For all this effort , the supermarket operator receives only pennies in compensation . If you buy twenty dollars ' worth of food in a supermarket , and then give a quarter tip to one of the checkout boys for carrying your hag out to the car , that boy  --  in pocketing your quarter  --  has made more money on your patronage than the supermarket owner has . No wonder Nick 's hair has turned gray . We thought he was running a supermarket all these years  --  a superbly effective one , in our judgment  --  when he 's really been trying to survive a revolution . That revolution has affected all of us , sometimes  --  as we have seen  --  in ways we did n't quite realize . Nobody knows quite when , or if . it will end . But it 's been a rousing experience so far . And the time of testing is not yet over . Before anyone jumps up from behind the stove and cries " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calmly and with shatteringly final emphasis , that every day is a fuel crisis in the internal mechanism of the human animal , and energy must be the end product . Therefore , in view of a general trend toward being at least aware of unwonted demands upon all types of fuel used in running households , it seems a good idea at this time to bring to the fore certain recipes which meet all the requirements of the " energy " season . Food to keep the body warm . Food to keep the body energetic . Food to keep the excessive use of fuel in preparation down . And , lest we forget , food which is pleasantly uplifting as to texture , variety , color , and above all , taste . And still , with all this in mind , we also want to think of the person preparing these dishes . Nothing offered here is complicated , but nothing isdull , either .
