txt For President Nixon , this is ... the crucial hour for cooling off in this nation and abroad , The first countrywide reaction to his 60-day price freeze , and accompanying proposals to limit food exports , give him a new period of grace to reverse inflationary trends . The moderation implicit in the fresh Hanoi-Washington agreements could , before long , offer President Nixon a way to end the bombing in Cambodia . And Mr. Nixon seeks , and has thus far , a cordial atmosphere for his talks with Soviet party leader Leonid I. Brezhnev . The prospects are for a reasonably successful meeting which will preserve the detente between the giants of communism and capitalism . White House efforts to clear the decks for the- Brezhnev visit were impeded by testimony of former White House aide Jeb Stuart Magruder that , in January he informed H. R. Haldeman , the President 's former top administrative aide and confidant , that there was a Watergate cover-up . White House correspondents then re-asked the question , which has persisted for months , " Was the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press secretary declined to answer or to say when the President would again discuss Watergate . The White House , meanwhile , continued to strengthen its staff on the professional ' political side with the return of Bryce N. Harlow to his post of counselor to the President . Mi . Harlow again took a leave of absence from his position with Procter &; Gamble . After the President 's economic message to the nation , Congress immediately junked its plans for a 90-day price and wage freeze to give Mr. Nixon a clear path ahead . Questions on the effectiveness of Mr. Nixon 's overall actions remain , however . The grumbling of consumer groups that prices were frozen at their highest level in 22 years was heard in the White House and Congress with sympathy , but no promise from any quarter that prices could be rolled back . There was general relief in bOth the political and economic community here that the President had abandoned what was generally conceded to be an ineffective , voluntary Phase 3 prograM . The caution which greets the new developments comes not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Treasury Secretary George P. Shultz says his personal judgment is that " patience " all around will be ? required and the direction the President now is taking " is a risk . " // *Nixon wins cooling-off time on two fronts // If this is judged as coming from a conservative who lost out in the infighting with John Connally pragmatists , it could be discounted . But Mr. Shultz , strong opponent of controls , remains in his office . Continued differences ' within administration high councils may , well hinder the President 's efforts to restore confidence in his economic leadership , it is assumed here , White House officials do not hide the enormity , of the task of piecing together a permanent program . In keeping with the instructions of President Nixon , they must find a way to satisfy the President 's preference for no controls and the widespread demands for a reversal of inflationary trends . In the prolonged extraction of the United States from Indo-China , Dr. Henry A. Kissinger mixes optimism and wariness in the same fashion as he did when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I am . not naive enough to pretend to you that the mere fact of again having agreed to certain works in itself guarantees peace , " he cautions , Congress remains , the power center to convince of both the validity of the President 's economic and Indo-China policies and his ability to put them into effect in these Watergate times . Recognizing this restiveness and suspicion , the President cultivates senators and representatives as never before in his 4% years or office . Dr. Kissinger rushed to Capitol Hill , the morning after returning from Paris talks . ? The presidential aide appealed to senators for " a finite amount of time " to work out a Cambodian agreement . Sen. Frank Church ( D ) of Idaho and other bombing critics rejected the request . Republican Minority Leader Hugh Scott of Pennsylvania said he would refuse to support bombing after the end of June . " If the cease-fire in South Vietnam is finally successfully implemented , as directed in the Paris agreement , there will be toasting and , cheers through the administration .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
