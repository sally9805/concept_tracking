At 10 G.M.T . one morning last week , as the disengagement agreement specified , an Israeli officer formally surrendered Kilometer 101 to the United Nations Emergency Force . A little more than an hour later the last five Israeli half-tracks and Jeeps pulled out . The blue-helmeted U.N . force struck its olive-drab tent on the Cairo-Suez highway that had been the site for the first face-to-face meeting of Israeli and Egyptian officers in almost two decades . Finally , Egyptian troops reoccupied the road to Suez . TIME Correspondent Wil ton Wynn , who followed them , filed this report : <P> On the outskirts of Suez , swarms of soldiers and civilians in militia uniforms were waiting to meet us . They happily cut loose with machine-gun and rifle fire into the air . Groups of ten or 20 in tur bans and long gallabiyas stood on wrecked enemy tanks that marked the farthest Israeli penetration into Suez . They waved Egyptian flags , along with olive and palm branches , and chanted : " Welcome to Suez . Salute the heroes who destroyed 32 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pigeons at his feet and a cup of tea in his hand , flashed a toothless grin and chanted " Allahu Akbar " ( God is the greatest ) . <P> Curious Booty . Two miles north of Port Taufiq , we crossed the canal on a barge to join the Third Army on the east bank . On a broad sandy plain , a curious collection had been assembled . To the rear , in a 100-yard semicircle , were arranged captured Israeli tanks , guns , missiles , shells and even the wreckage of a Phantom jet . In the center of the semicircle a white monument had been erected honoring the men who died during the Israeli siege of the army . In between booty and monument , officers and men representing all units of the Third Army were drawn up . <P> Somehow they did not look like survivors of a three-month siege . They appeared well fed . They stood smartly to attention , with uniforms incredibly clean and boots new and polished . Major General Ahmed Badawy , the tough Third Army commander , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighting indefinitely , and we were getting supplies regularly . I am not going to tell you how we were getting our military supplies , but we were getting them . " <P> Next day nine Egyptian Cabinet ministers arrived on a morale-building mission . They wandered among Third Army soldiers at random , embracing and kissing them and introducing themselves ( " I am Ahmed Hilal , Minister of Petroleum Affairs " ) . The troops swarmed around them , eager to tell stories . One soldier with an RPG ( Rocket Propelled Grenade ) antitank missile launcher slung over his shoulder almost wept when he met Mashhour Ahmed Mashhour , chairman of the Suez Canal Authority . <P> We drove on to ' Uyun Musa , a lonely spot on the Gulf of Suez where Moses was supposed to have found water by striking a rock ; now it was the site of the last fully intact fortification of the Israeli Bar-Lev Line . The 400 Egyptian troops manning it gave their visitors a rousing welcome . Standing on the ruined Israeli guns , they clapped hands , beat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their fortifications , " one improvised song boasted . " The Israelis fled ' Uyun Musa . We destroyed them .
