Walter Carlos : Sonic Seasonings ( Columbia , 2 LPs , $6.98 ) . When the Roman philosopher Seneca said , " All art is but imitation of nature , " he did n't know the half of it . Today 's electronic composer no longer bothers to imitate nature the way Vivaldi did in The Four Seasons . Tape recorder in hand , he simply camps at the seashore or in a rain forest , and lets Mother Nature herself compose an accelerando of breaking waves or a pizzicato polka of storm effects . Then he adds electronic sounds-whirrr , ping , eeeeeee , r-r-r-roar-and voila ! , the new art of sonic environments , " music " to the ears of those who would rather " hear " sound than " listen " to it . Walter ( Switched-On Bach ) Carlos here presents four tone poems-spring , summer , fall , winter-that give a good approximation of what a year 's hike might be like on the Appalachian Trail . Possible uses : mellifluous Muzak for a flower shop or Japanese tearoom , or dozy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Mozart : The Wind Concertos ( various soloists , the Berlin Philharmonic , Herbert von Karajan conductor ; Angel , 3 LPs , $17.98 ) . An exquisitely executed anthology for the Mozartean who has everything-or thinks he does . The selections range from what might be called the camaraderie concertos , the Sinfonia Concertante , K. 297b ( featuring oboe , clarinet , bassoon , horn ) and the Flute and Harp Concerto , K. 299 , to the solo works for bassoon ( K. 191 ) , flute ( K. 313 ) , oboe ( K. 314 ) and clarinet ( K. 622 ) . Von Karajan 's soloists , drawn from the Berlin Philharmonic , are superb . <P> Mozart : The Four Horn Concertos ( Barry Tuckwell soloist , Academy of St. Martin-in-the-Fields , Neville Marriner conductor ; Angel , $5.98 ) . As a solo instrument , the French horn lacks the innate variety of the piano or violin . That is a fact to be noted , then forgotten , while listening to this ravishing LP . Tuckwell plays the concertos as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the case of Nos. 3 ( K. 447 ) and 4 ( K. 495 ) is not too far from the truth . <P> Mozart : Eine Kleine Nachtmusik , Sinfonia Concertante for Violin and Viola , K. 364 , Symphony No. 32 ( Academy of St. Martin-in-the-Fields , Neville Marriner conductor ; Argo , $5.95 ) . Whether accompanying French-horn players ( see above ) or reinterpreting the Baroque repertory ( the Bach orchestral Suites , the Handel Concerti Grossi , Op. 6 ) , Neville Marriner is one of the best and busiest maestros on the London recording scene . His Mozart , an artful shading of sinew , sensuousness and sonority , is as good as anything he does . Indeed , Nachtmusik is the freshest , rosiest reading of that serenade to come along in years .
