txt A tall , expensively dressed man in his mid-50s , his hair beginning to gray , suddenly stood up , opened an attache case , took out two envelopes and dumped 1,000 $100 bills on the table . " Here 's your goddamned money , " said Chester Davis , general counsel for Summa Corp . and the personal attorney for billionaire recluse Howard Hughes . The room in the Capitol was hushed for almost 30 seconds . Then Sen. Sam Ervin Jr . D. , N. C. , chairman of the Senate Watergate committee , began to protest . " HE TRIED to say he did n't want to be responsible for that kind of money , that he did n't have any way to secure $100,000 , " said a source in the closed meeting between the Watergate committee and top Hughes aides . The money , reportedly the same $100,000 in cash given by Hughes aides to Charles Bebe Rebozo in 1969 as a campaign contribution to President Nixon and returned by Rebozo last June , had been subpenaed by the committee . Recovering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly locate a Sena te sergeant at arms . Accompanied by two Capitol policemen , he ordered the money counted and the serial numbers recorded , a task which took more than two hours . DAVIS DUMPED the money on the table after Ervin repeatedly had insisted that " the question is whether or not the committee is going to see the money , " according to the source at the meeting . The four-hour meeting concerned the money and whether Hughes aides can be required to testify in executive session before the committee staff without assurances they also would have the opportunity to testify in public . Davis has filed a suit claiming the law specifies they need not testify in private but can be required to testify in public . " Mr. Davis is willing to testify in public , but he does not want a distorted version leaked out of a private committee session , " said Richard Hanna . Howard Hughes ' public relations man .

Thus , Hanna claimed , the money consisted of Hughes ' personal funds and not corporate funds . FOLLOWING THE meeting . Ervin said Davis answered all questions asked of him but declined to discuss what Davis had said . Ervin was asked if Rebozo would be called to testify as a result of the information supplied by Davis . " There is very little doubt that Mr. Rebozo will be called to testify , " Ervin said . " In public ? " he was asked . " Yes , " Ervin responded . Rebozo already has told the committee that he got the money from Hughes aides in two installments in 1969 and 1970 . At the time he assumed the money was a Nixon campaign contribution , he said . The money never was turned over to the Nixon campaign committee but kept in a safe deposit box in a Florida bank controlled by Rebozo . In June the money was returned , according to Rebozo.            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
