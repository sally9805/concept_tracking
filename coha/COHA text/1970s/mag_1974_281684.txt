11 HARROW HOUSE <P> Directed by ARAM AVAKIAN Screenplay by JEFFREY BLOOM <P> For a good time , check in at 11 Harrow House . That is the London address - so this movie says-of the wealthiest , stuffiest and best-guarded diamond exchange in the world . Needless to say , such an institution is likely to cause a certain amount of envy and resentment among those forced to do business with it . Among them you can number a smalltime diamond dealer ( Charles Grodin ) , who is always being put down for violating its dress code or smoking in the waiting room , and a power-crazed tycoon ( Trevor Howard ) who wants to crack the vaults just for the hell of it . The third malcontent is an employee ( James Mason ) who is dying of cancer after 30 years of service , but just before the firm 's unbending insurance program would cover his family . <P> Abetted by Candice Bergen , as a thrill-seeking but good-natured deb , they determine to crack the uncrackable safe . At this point , what looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comic life that is about as refreshing as any adventure movie around these days . The grand plan calls for the orchestration of such oddly diverse elements as hand-painted cockroaches , an enormous piece of chocolate cake and a giant vacuum cleaner . Better still , it requires Grodin to convert himself from a chronically depressed victim into a man of action . That development-as his voice-over narration , rather like a rehearsal for a Woody Allen monologue , makes clear-does nothing to alleviate his deep existential dread . " She is a very good person , " he says with heartfelt gratitude as Bergen volunteers for a particularly dangerous bit of criminality . " This is a very frightened truck , " he observes as their robbery vehicle draws up in front of 11 Harrow House to begin the caper . His comment , when Howard 's mistress comes to their rescue after Howard has turned against Grodin and troops of bad guys are wildly pursuing him over hill and dale : " I wish I 'd been nicer to her . " <P> It is all very silly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in The Heartbreak Kid , is as funny as a schlemiel as he was as a Lothario ; Bergen has never been more loose and natural ; Mason is touching as a defeated man given a miraculous opportunity to close out life with a big win ; and no less a figure than Sir John Gielgud is humorously on hand as the fussy manager of No. 11 . This poised , stylish cast shines quite as impressively as the quarry in the vault . Richard Schickel
