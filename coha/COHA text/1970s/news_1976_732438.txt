txt Now that spring training camps are alive and well in Florida , Arizona and California , the baseball picture is bright  --  right ? Wrong . The players will work themselves into some sort of shape and start the season , as scheduled , April 8 . But that does n't mean the labor situation is in good shape , too . On the contrary , now that the camps are open the pressure for a quick settlement is off , it 's very likely that the apparent movement of the owners and players will dissolve into a state of suspended animation . It 's a state that could conceivably , exist throughout much , maybe all , of the season . First will come the reassessment of positions . The Players Relations Committee , the embattled owners ' negotiating group , will reassess its position today at a meeting in John Gaherin 's office on 42d Street . Then all the owners willi have a chance to assess and reassess the situation at a joint league meeting with Commissioner Bowie Kuhn at the Plaza Hotel tomorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associated with the Fourth of July . " It wo n't be the friendliest meeting I 've ever attended , " remarked one owner 's man . A minority , but outspoken , group of owners is irate at the concessions they felt the negotiating committee made to the players in last Monday 's " best and final " proposal . Some of the dissident owners even want to change the makeup of the committee , which consists of six club officials and the two league presidents . One source close to the negotiations suggested that it would n't be difficult to make that change . " I think the owners on the committee have had it up to here , " the source said . " Their , work is totally voluntary and if they get any more lip , they 'll tell them what to do with the job . " Besides an alteration in the committee , ' though , it appears there could be a change in the owners ' position on the negotiations . The Monday proposal is dead , at least technically , because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , always have a way of returning to the bargaining table , but in this case , if the rebellious owners prevail , the next proposals the players . see may be drastically less than what they have considered so far . Compounding the problem are the disparate views of the players ' action at their By JOSEPH DURSO special to The New York Times ST . PETERSBURG , Fla. , March ** began hitting baseballs with sticks in Florida ' ' and Arizona ? today as spring training arrived 18 days : late - and ? the ' training camps finally . sprang to life . The legal dispute over the 600 players ' contracts was still raging and there Were signs that prolonged bargaining would be needed to decide just how the major leaguers might break tradition acid become free agents . But while that question was being pursued by the negotiators in New York , the first wave of players started to arrive in camp to pursue baseballs in the sun . The camps were ordered open last night by the commissioner of baseball , Bowie Kuhn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was the third time in eight years that the five-week training period had been disrupted by labor woes and , except for the war years , it was the latest start for the camps in modern times . Some of the players had been working out in groups on public playgrounds and college diamonds , and they were the first on the scene today . The rest were expected tomorrow or even later in the case of Latin Americans with visa problems , and in many camps only half the usual number of men reported for work . " I look out and feel unrest , " said Joe , the general manager of the New York Mets , as he watched 21 of his players exercising here . " I do n't know if they 're Mets or free agents . I do n't know how long they 'll be here . " What will it finally cost us to live with a system of free agents ? It will cost us beaucoup millions  --  most in salaries to keep guys from jumping to other clubs . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salary and hope that 'll satisfy him . No , I 'm not licking my lips thinking that I can get a Reggie Jackson in return in the open market . No way . To acquire stars like that , you 'd need to make a capital expenditure that would be unreasonable for ? any other business . " The scene was being replayed up and down both coasts of . Florida and in Arizona where the 24 training camps began bustling before small but appreciative crowds of fans . Crosstown from the Mets base , the St. Louis Cardinals opened training on a field already populated with their farmhands . Across the bay in Tampa , the world champion Cincinnati Reds started ; the Philadelphia Phillies did the same in Clearwater , the Pittsburgh Pirates in Bradenton , the New York Yankees in Fort Lauderdale , and the American League champion Boston Red Sox at Winter Haven . The Mets camp was directed by the new manager , Joe Frazier , and by two minor league managers and the minor league pitching coach . Frazier 's regular coaches were struggling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel boom . About 60 percent of the Mets players made it , with 14 unreported . But the workers included Tom Seaver , who pitched 10 minutes of batting practice and who later reflected on recent suggestions that he had been a " militant " in the dispute with the owners . " It 's a great feeling , " Seaver said with emphasis , " to have stood up for what you think is right and to have accomplished what you wanted . " One thing that Seaver wanted , a three-year contract for $800,000 , was not yet accomplished . But came out of his office at Huggins-Stengel Field as the two-hour workout ended and quipped : " Gabe Paul 's on the phone . You 're traded to the Yankees . " Seaver laughed , and quickly added , alluding to his star pitcher 's contract : " I want to talk to you later . " Across the state in Fort Lauderdale , 14 Yankees reported and 24 did not . The players on hand included Graig Nettles , Elliott Maddox , Roy White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin traffic with the help of the Yankees ' prodigal son , Yogi Berra , a coach . " I see a bunch of Yankees , not free agents , " said Paul , the president of the club , whose vision differs from 's . " I do n't know what it will cost us in a year or two , but we 're not going to get into a bidding war for players . We 'll avoid that by trying not to lose our own guys . Playing in New York probably helps us keep them . " I think Bowie Kuhn made the right decision opening the camps in the face of a lot of opposition . It 's not a black day at all because of the uncertainty over the legal issues . The only thing I do n't like about the late start is not being able to play all the exhibition games . That 's where you determine the talent , so the young player will suffer the most  --  like a salesman not being able to show his products . " The Mets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including two in Puerto Rico , and will play for the first time next Thursday against the Cardinals . The Yankees have missed eight games so far and will cancel more , but hope to salvage a large part of their 28-game schedule . Both the Mets and Yankees agreed that this was truly the " first " day of spring training from a physical point of view , meaning they would not assume that some players were farther along because of their informal " exile " camps . But they also agreed that some pitchers had been throwing for nearly three weeks , even in scrimmage games . So , first day or not , the Mets used their best four pitchers  --  Seaver , Jon Matlack , Jerry Koosman and Mickey Lolich  --  for 10 minutes apiece . in batting practice . " Most of our pitchers are n't just starting , " said Jerry Grote , the catcher . " They 're really a couple of weeks along . " And did the players feel less " involved " because they might be entering the new era of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm not in any hurry to go somewhere , " Grote said . " I 'm happy where I am . Most guys wo n't jump  --  but the ball club will have to pay more to keep them . " Start of Spring Drills May Delay Settlement // executive board meeting in Florida Wednesday . The owners have developed the idea , at least for public consumption , that the players quashed Marvin Miller 's attempt to get them to reject overwhelmingly the owner 's proposal . One official said the players " put a leash on Marvin , " If the owners proceed with this belief as part of their strategy , they could run into problems because that view is 180 degrees from the picture painted by the players . They maintain that Miller never sought rejection of the proposal , but his and the board 's primary aim was ? to get camps open . Whatever they did at the meeting , this view goes , they did n't want to do anything that would give the commissioner an excuse not to order camps opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting was spent on trying to work out the proper wording in response to the owner 's proposed solution to the " oneand-one " problem , the court interpretation that says a player can - become a free agent after playing one year without a signed contract . " . . . the Players Association , " the board 's resolution said of the owner 's proposed eight team draft of free agents " is prepared to agree on such a mechanism , along the general lines proposed by the owners . . . " , One-third of the board members was opposed to that idea , feeling the players were going too far , but twothirds was willing to accept some kind of control over player movement in the next few years under existing contracts . As long as there Is no agreement on a new reserve system , the option-year concept remains in effect . That , of course , would be to the advantage of the players . The owners could try to show that an impasse has been reached in negotiations and , under National Labor Relations Board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Proving an impasse exists , though , is not a mere formality . For the time being , the owners will follow last year 's rules and hope it is n't next year before they reach a settlement .
