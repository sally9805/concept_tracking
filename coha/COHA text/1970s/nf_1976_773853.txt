txt // the animals housed . The main climatic factors from which protection is to be provided are ? high and low ambient temperatures , environmental humidity , solar radiation , winds and rain . Animal production . Animal growth , production and reproduction are the ultimate concerns of the farmer . Animal production and reproduction are not generally influenced by slight and normal seasonal variations in environmental factors . But when animals are exposed to extreme conditions for longer periods , the performance of animals is impaired ; resulting in death in extreme cases . Thus , animal houses should be so designed that they are cheaper and afford protection from extreme weather conditions . Expensive fittings and designs on a permanent basis should not be resorted to to face only brief periods of climatic extremes . Often it will suffice to make some temporary additions and alterations ( like provision of hessain cloth curtains as protection against bitter cold draughts on a very cold day ) to protect animals against short periods of inclement weather . Animal Shelter Designs The degree of environmental control provided by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the animals being reared and the natural climate from which they are to be protected . So far the ideal environment desired by different livestock in tropics has not been scientifically studied . Economics . Economics of the cost of construction , equipment and operations versus production returns dictate the extent of environmental control that can be attempted . Thus , as the genetic production potential increases and one tends to feed and manage the stock more scientifically , better climatic control by costlier but superior designs can be attempted for increased returns . Ventilation . Animals confined in a closed environment tend to alter the composition of the air by reducing the oxygen content and increasing the carbon dioxide and moisture content and by adding ruminant gases , ammonia from faeces and urine , and microscopical particles of dust from feed . For maximum comfort and productivity and for an optimum environment there should be proper ventilation in animal houses . Sufficient air must be exchanged to remove detrimental levels of water vapour , ammonia , carbon dioxide , dust and air-borne micro-organisms. // TYPES OF ANIMAL HOUSING It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be equally suitable for livestock farming all over the country , owing to the different methods of animal husbandry and/or farming priorities , which in turn are governed by climatic , geographic , economic and other conditions . All the same , there are , broadly speaking , two types of livestock houses : namely conventional barns and loose houses . Strictly speaking this classification holds good for dairy cattle housing only . What is followed for other types of livestock can be said as the modifications of these two types . The farmer has to select a type of housing , keeping in view his local conditions . The suitability of the different types of housing in different geographical regions is discussed in this chapter . Conventional Barns These are also called stanchion barns . These refer to housing in which the cows are confined together on a platform and secured at neck by stanchions or neck chains . The cows are fed as well as milked in this barn . The barns are completely roofed and the walls are also complete with windows and/or ventilators located at suitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any semblance to barns , except for the swine barns ; the swine are , however , not confined in a barn , but are let free . Animals and men caring for animals in barns are less exposed to harsh weather conditions . There is also a feeling that the animals can be kept cleaner and diseases controlled better in barns . Barns may be constructed in temperate Himalayan regions where the winters are prolonged and severe . In warmer parts , the air in barns tends to be humid and barn floors damp during autumn and rainy seasons ; and hence are not recommended . However , under loose housing system a milking barn or parlor is always constructed in which the cows are secured at milking time and are milked ( see under heading Buildings required on dairy farms ' , page 85 ) . Loose Housing This comprises of keeping cows loose in an open paddock or pasture throughout the day and night except at milking time . The open paddock is provided with shelter along one side under which the animals can retire when it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watering tank is provided and fodder is fed in common // mangers . Concentrates are fed at the time of milking , which is done in a separate milking barn . It is ideal to store dry fodder in the sheltered area where animals are allowed a limited access through movable fence ; this is known as self-feeding . The open paddock is enclosed by means of half walls or wooden or plain wire fences of convenient height ( Figs. 5.2 and 5.3 ) . All types of livestock can be housed and managed under loose housing system . This type of housing is suitable to most parts of the country except in temperate Himalayan region and perhaps in heavy rainfall areas . However , slight modifications of structure or use of extra fittings is often necessary to protect animals during extreme cold or hot seasons ( Fig. 5.4 ) . The loose houses are cheaper to construct , easier to expand and flexible in utility . Feeding and management of stock is easier in these because of common feeding and watering arrangements ; and animals are more comfortable as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent more stock than the standard can be accom modated in each loose house for shorter periods without unduly affecting their performance . Free Ranges Free ranges or the so-called ranches indicate a type of stock management rather than a type of housing . This comprises of leav ing stock free in a large estate ? sometimes extending to thousands of square metres . The farm headquarters is situated generally at the centre of estate . The area is generally a natural or cultivated pasture land with watering points and shelters located at convenient places . // This type of farming is suited for those animals that are not handled daily , such as beef cattle and sheep . Big cattle and sheep ranches are quite common in southern parts of America and in Australia . There is scope for rearing sheep on ranch conditions in the north-western arid parts and in some hilly regions of the country . SPACE REQUIREMENTS IN ANIMAL HOUSES Standards for space requirements for different species of livestock that are currently in vogue are based on experience and convention rather than on actual experimentation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain standards of space requirements for farm animals . These standards are for loose houses . There is a sort of insistence that animal houses in this country should be constructed as per these standards . Hence , discussions on different aspects of housing animals in this chapter are mostly based on the ISt standards . Floor Space Requirements The requirements of floor space per individual animal of differen classes on livestock farms are given in Table 1 . In the last column o this table is given the maximum number of animals that can b housed per pen . Under emergencies 10 per cent more stock can b put in each pen for short periods , otherwise more pens should b constructed to accommodate the extra animals , keeping in view th number of animals that can be housed per pen . Constructing a larger pen with an idea to house larger number of animals is no advisable as feeding and management of animals will not h sufficient ; bossy animals may keep the docile ones away from feed and water . In certain buildings like calving and farrowing pens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space ? more so its shape and size ? to be provided per individual animal has to be slightly differen than the standard requirements described above , due to obvious reasons . Details of such special space provisions are shown in the different layouts given in a later section . Feeding and Watering Space Requirements Apart from providing sufficient floor space in animal houses , care should be taken to see that the dimensions of manger and water troughs are such that all the animals in the pen have a free access Housing Farm Animals 87 drain towards the standings side of the passage is sufficient . The floor of the standing should be paved with a slope of 1 in 40 towards drains . There should be walls along the length and at each end of the sheds to support the beams of the roof . The roof of the shed should be gabled . The eves of the roof shall project out at least 50 cm away from the side walls . The side walls need not neces-sarily be complete ; large open spaces may be left in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to the roof , as is necessary in cooler and/or heavy rainfall areas , there shall be win-dows and ventilators at suitable places in the walls . Some device should be arranged to secure individual animals by neck in each standing ( Fig. 5.5C ) . The milking barn may , if nece-ssary , be extended to accommodate down-calvers as well as calves . Further , milch cows that are in heat can be left after milking in the // standings and inseminated right there . Sheds for milch/dry cows . These are sheds for housing milch cows and dry cows separately . On small farms a partition can be raised in one shed for housing dry cows separately . On farms with only a few animals , all the cows ? milking or dry ? can be housed together . These are simple sheds comprising of a covered portion and an adjoining open paddock ( see Figures 5.6 and 5.7 ) . The manger and water tank dimensions shall be as specified in Table 2 . The covered area should preferably be of cement concrete . Brick-on-edge or stone-slab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or kankar flooring should be laid . Moorum flooring is quite good for the open paddock , though brick-on-edge floor is better . Maternity pens . Pregnant cows are to be transferred into maternity pens or calving boxes two to three weeks before the expected date of calving . The number of calving boxes or maternity pens required is about 5 per cent of the number of breedable female stock on the farm . These should be located nearer to living quarters of farmer and/or milking barn so that the down-calvers are constantly observed . The pens can be constructed either in a row or in groups of two or four . The dimensions of each calving pen shall be about 3 X 4 m for covered area and another 3 x 4 m for the open paddock . The covered area shall have a 1.25 m high wall all around , barring a I.2m wide gate opening into the open lot . A manger and a water trough of proper size should be constructed in each pen . The floors shall be of moorum , brick-on-edge or cement paved with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animal shed . Sheds more or less similar to maternity pens in structure shall be located well away from the other sheds so that these sheds are inaccessible to other animals . Calf shed . The calf shed can be located either at the end or on the side of the milking barn . This facilitates taking calves to their dams quickly at milking time ( if weaning is not practised ) , and hand feeding of milk to calves if weaning is practised . If there is a large number of calves , the calf sheds shall form a separate unit ? but located nearer to milking barn , so that calves of different age groups can be housed separately ( see Figs. 5.5 and 5.6 ) . The dimensions of calf shed depend on the number of calves to be housed . The dimensions of mangers and water troughs shall be as per specifications . Floors shall be of cement concrete in covered area and brick-on-edge in open area . // Young stock shed . Older heifer calves from about six months of age to breeding age are to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ male calves are kept on farms beyond six months of age . When a large number of young stock is there , they should be divided into different age groups and each group housed separately . When their number is small , the young stock shed may be an extension of the dry animal shed or it may be a separate unit nearer to it . In the latter case , the sheds shall be constructed in a single row of sheds facing each other ( see Fig. 5.6 . ) . The constructional details of this shed are the same as for cow sheds except for the difference in dimensions of mangers and water troughs . // Bull sheds . The bull sheds should be constructed towards one end of the farm . There shall be one shed for each bull ; the number of bulls required being one for every 50 breedable females on the farm , if natural breeding is practised . When artificial insemination service facilities are available nearby , there may be no necessity to keep bulls on the farm . The bull shed shall have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a paddock of 120 square metres . Ancillary Structures on Dairy Farm Stores . Stores for concentrate feeds , hay , straw and equipment are a must on animal farms . The size and type of buildings for stores can be decided on the basis of the quantity of feeds and fodders that are to be stored at a time on the farm . Approximate storage space required for different feeds is given in Table 3 . These figures may be helpful in determining the sizes of feed stores , though a sound judgement of the situation is all that is needed . Sometimes the size of the concentrate store required is determined on the pre sumption that 0.2 m storage space is required per adult unit . There shall be one main concentrate store-cum-feed mixing room at a distant place ; but it is advisable to have a small ration room nearer to milking barn ( see Fig. 5.2 ) for storing prepared concentrate mixture temporarily for a day or two . On smaller farms perhaps one feed store near the milking barn ( see Fig. 5.12 ) will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rodent-proof . Silos . Silage is an important item of feed for dairy animals . Silage is obtained by ensiling chaffed green fodders in silos . Tower , pit and trench silos are in use ; but under Indian conditions trench silos will be more practicable and convenient . The capacity of different sizes of trench silos is given in Table 4 . The figures given in the first three columns are the cross-sectional dimensions of the trench . // The details of trench silo with self-feeding arrangements are shown in Figure 5.8 . The silos shall be made nearer to the cow pens , if possible . A movable sturdy wooden or metal fence or any other self-feeding device should be fixed to the open end of the trench silo so that the cows can feed on silage at will , thus saving the time and labour otherwise required for transportation and feeding or silage in the animal sheds . The trench for the silo can be a simple excavation made in a hard ground and then the floor and sides hardened by ramming and mud plastering . Cement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are longer lasting and seepage-proof . Milk house . Milk house is another important item of dairy // farm buildings . This is the place where the milk is collected , weighed , and stored in cans for brief periods ? before delivering to milk plants . Dimensions of milk house depend upon the quantity of milk handled daily ( Table 5 ) . This floor space can accommodate the milk recording equipment , milk cooling device in the form of bulk cooler , can racks , milking pail rack , sinks , washing outfit and furniture of the milk recorder . On very large farms the different components of the milk house i.e. recording-cum-milk cooling room , milk utensils and equipments room and washing room , may be constructed as separate units ( Fig. 5.9 ) . The doors and the windows of the milk house shall be made flyproof . The flooring of the room shall be of cement concrete , impervious and reinforced with iron strips located at suitable distances to make it hard wearing . The walls should be lined with white glazed tiles up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concrete slab ( like that of a laboratory bench ) shall be provided for keeping the milk testing apparatus ( Fig. 5.9 ) . Hay/straw sheds . As the common dry fodders ? hay or crop byproducts ? are available at the harvesting seasons only , one has to store these items for use throughout the year . Space requirement shall depend upon the manner in which the dry fodder is stored ( see Table 3 ) . Adult stock consume about 6 kg of dry fodder per day while young stock consume about 3 kg per day . Annual quantity of hay needed can be worked out on the basis of the number of days in a year when hay is required . The size of the shed needed to store this hay or straw can be calculated by referring to Table 3 . Sheds , preferably with walls on three sides , are better for storing straw or hay . Storing hay or straw as stacks in the open results in excessive wastage in the form of spoilage and deterioration . Sometimes a simple framed shed with gabled roof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animal sheds because of fire hazards . On larger farms the hay sheds can be made into sort of self-feeding hay bunks by placing movable wooden partition on one side edge of // the hay shed . The animals can eat hay at will from only the por tions accessible through this wooden partition and do not spoil the hay excessively . Fig. 5.10 . ( A ) . Handling yard for a medium sized dairy farm . A. Assembly pen , B. Collecting pen , C. Weighing machine , D. Weighing platform , E. Operators lounge , F. Working table , G. Trevis or Crush for cattle , H. Spraying chamber , I. Overhead sprayer , J. Spraying equipment . Handling yards . On larger farms it is advantageous and econo mical to construct one flexible handling yard that can he used for the three processes of animal handling , namely collecting , filing and control of individual animal for weighing , vaccination , marking etc . The sizes and numbers of different component pens of handling yards depend on the heads of stock handled . A simple design of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 5.10 ( B ) . On small farms provision of simple trevis or cattle crush is suffi cient for controlling animals . The constructional details of a trevis are given in chapter 2 . Layouts for Dairy Farms The first thing to be considered before planning to build a dairy farm is the size of farm and economic returns anticipated from the farm . A dairy farm should preferably be started with a small herd . The farm buildings can be constructed with cheap semi-permanent materials . As one starts getting good returns , and learns about farming in the process , one should increase his herd strength . And when one is established in the business one can construct extensive farm buildings with better materials . Suitable layouts for dairy farms of different sizes are given in Figs. 5.6 , 5.7 , 5.11 and 5.12 . Farmers may consider any layout de96 Farm Animal Management pending on their herd strength . The layouts are intended to show the sizes , numbers and locations of the different functional units . A farmer may modify these to suit his locations and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be an ideal house for the one or two animals kept by a small farmer in India , for whom dairying is only a secondary occupation . Considering a small farmer 's econo- // mic position , perhaps , the place where he keeps his cow or pair of bullocks presently , may be the best ; only it should be kept clean , dry and airy . BUILDINGS REQUIRED ON SHEEP AND GOAT FARMS Sheep are reared for meat or wool or both . Similarly goats may be reared for milk or meat or both . Requirements of building units are more or less the same for sheep and goats , except that additional buildings are required for goats kept for milk . // Sheep and goats do not require any elaborate buildings . Simple dry and clean sheltered enclosers are all that is needed . Often the flocks are penned in the open during fair weather and some tempo rary shelters are made use of in monsoon and winter . Sheep can be economically reared under ranch system . Details of sheds required // on sheep and goat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Generally , only half-walled sheds are provided for sheep with no open paddocks . Sheep are folded in the sheds during night time and taken out for grazing during day time ; hence , no necessity for separate open paddocks . Buildings for Sheep and Coat Farms General flock shed . Adult breeding ewes or nannies are housed in this shed . Each shed should accommodate about 60 ewes or nannies . The shed should be three metres high and should have moorum or brick on-edge floor ( Figs. 5.13 and 5.14 ) . In low lying and heavy rainfall areas the floors should preferably be elevated and in temperate Himalayan regions they may be made of strong wood . Shed for ram or buck . Rams or bucks are housed individually in these sheds . Alternatively , wooden partitions can be raised in a bigger shed ( Figs. 5.13 and 5.14 ) to partition it into stalls . Lambing or kidding shed . These are the maternity pens . Pregnant ewes or nannies are housed individually in these sheds . These sheds shall be made draught free . In northern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room heater shall be fixed in maternity pens , so that new-born kids or lambs are protected from cold during winter . Lamb or kid shed . Lambs or kids from weaning upto attaining maturity are housed in these sheds at the rate of about 75 animals per shed . By making suitable partitions ( see Figs. 5.13 and 5.14 ) in a larger shed ; unweaned , weaned but immature and nearingmaturity lambs can be housed separately . On larger farms however , three separate sheds may be constructed to house three categories of kids or lambs ( see Fig. 5.14 ) . Sick animal shed . Away from the other sheds one or more ( depending on flock size ) sick animal sheds of about 3 x 2 x 3 m size may be constructed . Shearing room . This is the place where sheep are shorn and hence , a shearing room is required only on farms where sheep are kept for wool . This room should be well-lit by having large glass windows all around . The floors should be cement paved and surface made smooth ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the shearing room there shall be two simple fenced lots where sheep can be collected before and after shearing . These lots should lead into the shearing room through 1.5 m wide passage . Accessory buildings . Next to the shearing room shall be located the wool store for storing wool and shearing equipments . This room // should have clean smooth floors and walls lined with glazed tiles upto a height of one and a half metres . The room should be made dust and damp-proof . There shall be three windows on three sides . There should also be weighing yards , stores for concentrates mixture , medicines , farm equipment etc. and sheds for hay straw storage at convenient places . The general details of these are more or less the same described under the heading " Ancillary structures on dairy farm " on page 91 . Another important structure required on a sheep farm is the dipping tank , the details of which are given in chapter 4 . Buildings for Milch Goat Farms Larger mulch goat farms are rarely seen in this country , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milch goats for family requirements . When a few goats are only kept , all that is required for them is a simple shelter under which are provided a water trough and feed manger ; the sizes of the latter depending on the number of animals housed . When large numbers of goats are kept there shall be separate sheds for different categories of animals such as milch goat sheds , buck shed , kidding shed and kid shed ( see Figs. 5.13 and 5.14 ) . The milch goats should be housed in one shed divided into a number of stalls , one stall for each doe . This facilitates milking and stall feeding of goats individually . The stalls may be arranged in two rows with a passage between them . The dimensions of each stall should be 0.8 m wide and 1.2 metre long ( see Fig. 5.15 ) The length of the shed depends on the number of milch goats kept . There should be partitions between stalls made of brick-work or stone slabs or iron tubing . Sometimes // a small milk room is constructed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analogous to milk houses on dairy farms . The constructional details of the buck shed , kidding shed , and kid shed have already been described . BUILDINGS FOR SWINE FARMS Experiments carried out all over the world have shown that hous-ing of pigs in proper structures is essential . Swine buildings apart from providing protection against inclement weather should also provide proper hygienic conditions required to maintain the heal-thy growth of pigs . A sort of semi-indoor system of swine farming in loose houses is generally suitable in this country . However , it may be necessary to modify structural designs and/or change cons-truction materials under an expert opinion suiting local conditions , especially at places where extreme climatic conditions prevail . Sheds for pigs are known as sties . There shall be sties to house pigs of different ages separately . Dimensions of the sties shall be as per standards given in Table 1 . Dimensions of mangers and water tanks in adult and young pig sties shall be as specified in Table 2 . Sties for Breeding Stock Boar sty . The boars should be housed in individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one roof . The number of stalls depends on the number of breeding boars kept on the piggery . // Gilt sty and dry sow sty . On smaller farms dry sows and gilts can be housed together ( Fig. 5.16 ) . On larger farms there shall be two different sties for dry sows and gilts ( Fig. 5.17 ) . These are simple loose houses in which the floor shall be cement paved in the covered area and brick lined in the open area . These sties shall be in a row . Three to ten pigs should be housed in each sty depending on stage of pregnancy . Farrowing-cum nursing sty . Each sty shall accommodate one sow with its litter . Pregnant sows are transferred to these sties two weeks before the due date and are left here during the nursing period also . The farrowing sty shall be so designed as to provide sufficient room for the nursing sow to sleep and the piglings to move about ( Fig. 5. 18 ) . Guard rails shall be provided along the walls 25 cm above ground level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lies down so that they may not get crushed between the sow and the wall . Sties for Young Stock Fattening pig sty . These are for housing pigs that are being fattened for the market . About 15-30 pigs should be housed in each pen depending on their age . Sty , for weaner piglets . Piglets that are weaned are housed in these pens upto six months of age . Not more than 30 piglings should be kept in each pen . Accessory Items Apart from the buildings for the stock , a few subsidiary buildings like weighing yards , loading and unloading ramp , stores , garbage boiling vats , wallowing tank etc. are also required on swine farms . Details of a simple weighing yard for pigs is shown in Fig. 5.16 . This is the place where pigs are periodically collected and weighed . The details of store are more or less the same as described under cattle housing ( see page 91 ) . There shall be a permanent ramp ( Fig. 5. 16 ) , on swine farms for loading and unloading pigs into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boiler room in which provisions are made for boiling garbage ( before feeding to pigs ) in big vessels or in jacketed vats with fire or steam generated in a boiler . There shall be one or two manure pits situated at least 15 m away from sties . As regards liquid manure , including urine and shed washings , a su.Yiable proHousing // vision shall be made for its disposal for irrigating the cultivated areas through gravitation . CONSTRUCTIONAL DETAILS OF DIFFERENT STRUCTURES The construction of buildings starts from the foundation and gradually rises from plinth to walls and roof . Then different structures are raised inside the buildings . The materials used for construction of different structures depend on their cost , local availability , type of farm buildings and other reasons . Construction of Floors The floors shall be hard , impervious to water and easy to clean . The floor may be of ( i ) cement concrete or paved with cement concrete flooring tiles ; ( ii ) brick-on-edge flooring ( iii ) stone-slabflooring , or ( iv ) moorum or kankar flooring . The best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made only in milking barns , stores , calf pens , shearing rooms , pig sties etc. where strength , cleanliness and imperviousness of floors are important . In general sheds of cattle and other animals , floors may be made of stone-slabs or brick-on-edge linings , i.e. stone slabs or bricks laid and set in cement or lime mortar . Moorum or kankar floors are cheapest but are messy and require constant maintenance . Moorum floors are all right in sheep pens and in the open area of pens for cattle and buffaloes . Certain bituminous floorings were tried in Western countries and found to provide a warmer surface . Wooden floors are also warm and can be tried with advantage in temperate Himalayan region . Floors should be laid over firm plinth the height of which depends upon the nature of the ground , the location and importance of the building , rainfall , dampness , drainage and possibility of nuisance from insects , scorpions , snakes etc . Its height is normally 45 cm to 90 cm ; can be higher in damper areas . It may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a gradient of I in 40 to I in 60 towards the drains so that wash water can run into drains easily . Special care should be taken to make the surface of floors rough and non-slippery in milking barns , passages leading to milking barn , calf pens , pig sties etc. where cement concrete floors arc laid . Brick-on-edge floors are sufficiently rough and may not require any special efforts , in this direction . The surface of cement floors can be roughened by imprinting the impression of a piece of expanded metal or suitable I06 Farm Animal Management wire mesh on the surface while the concrete is still moist . Elevated slatted floors made of bamboo splits or timber are some times used in portable houses for sheep and swine . Walls Under loose housing system walls are few and not so extensive . The covered area has walls only at the ends . The open area is en closed by one and a half metres high half walls . Walls should be erected over foundations of sufficient strength . The walls may be ' constructed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material suitable for the locality and climate . Stone or brick walls are costly but durable and hygienic . Bamboo and mud walls are economical and useful but are temporary and are difficult to keep hygienic . Concrete walls 10 to 12 em thick and reinforced with steel bars along their length and height are strong est and best but are very expensive . Walls supporting the roof and wall portions with which farm animals come in direct contact must be robust and materials such as brick , stone or cement concrete may be best at least for the lower parts of the walls . For ordinary walls , thickness should not exceed 35 cm , the side walls being fully thick and the lengthwise ones slightly less thick . Partition walls and walls lining the open area should be 22.5 cm ( two-brick ) thick . Height of walls shall be 2 to 2.5 metres for houses with sloping roofs . Walls and partition can also be made of galvanised corrugated iron or asbestos sheets by fixing to posts 2.5 to three metres apart . Usually the inner face of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The roof should be light , strong , durable , weather-proof , good looking , a bad conductor of heat and free from tendency to con-dense moisture inside . There are two types ofroofs sloping and flat . Flat roofs are preferred in low rainfall , dry areas while sloping roofs are desirable in medium to heavy rainfall areas . There are several materials available for roofing farm building including tiles , slates , G. C. I. sheets , corrugated asbestos and aluminium sheets , wood , thatch , bamboo etc . G. C. I. , asbestos and aluminium sleets have many advantages ; the chief being fire resisHousing // tance , easy fixing , reasonably long life , hygiene and cheapness in the long run . These being light materials do not require heavy roof supporting structures . Tiles and slates are cumbersome to fix and require heavy supporting structures . Wood makes the most comfor-table roof , being a good insulator ; but is liable to fire risks and is quite costly . Thatch and bamboo are most readily available and cheap materials ; these are good insulators and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these are unhygienic , especially during monsoon and harhour insects , flies , cobwebs and vermin and are highly prone to fire hazards . Though initial investment on thatch roofs is small , they are costly in the long run due to high cost of maintenance and frequent replacements . The slope of a roof is expressed as its pitch-angle of slope with the horizontal . The pitch should be 35 ? for thatched roof , 25 ? to 30 ? for a tiled roof and 12 ? to 18 ? for a sheet roof . The slope is generally kept steeper in heavy rainfall areas . The pitch should not exceed 45 ? at any rate . The roof can be single-sloped or double-sloped . Single-sloped roof can be used for huts and hay sheds upto a span ( dis-tance between side walls ) of 3 metres . Double-sloped roofs are used for more important buildings with wider spans . For single-sloped roofs the supporting walls or posts are higher on one side than the other and rafters are fixed directly on opposite walls or posts ( Fig. 5.19 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or roof frames . A couple-closed roof ( Fig. 2.20 ) or a collar beam roof ( Fig. 5.21 ) is suitable for spans of four to six metres . A king-post truss ( Fig. 5.22 ) has to be used for still wider spans , // In a loose house the roof has to be mostly supported on pillars . Pillars may be built either of stones , columns of bricks laid in cement mortar , cast iron pipes or hard wooden posts . Each of them shall be placed at intervals of two to three metres depending on the span and type of roof . The approximate width or diameter of pillars shall be as given below : In hot regions a ceiling of wooden planks , stout country cloth ( dungaree ) , old gunny bags , tarpaulin , compressed or loose straw or wooden planks should be fixed to the underside of the roof for heat insulation . For similar reason , the upper surface of roof may be painted white ( which reflects back radiation ) while the under sur face painted with darker colours . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eves with a 15 cm half-galvanised sheet gutter to convey and discharge rain water at a suitable spot for easy drainage . In dry regions , the water can be diverted and stored in tanks for future use . Mangers Mangers are very important structures in loose houses as the whole feeding plan may flop because of mangers of improper size . Mangers can be made either in the covered area or in the open lot . Manger dimensions should be as per standards given in Table 2 . The manger shall be of continuous type . Mangers can be made of stone slabs , wooden planks , bricks lined with cement mortar or of cement concrete . The flooring material of the manger may be the same as for floor of shed but the surface shall be rounded off and finished smooth . The tops of manger walls shall be arched rather than leaving flat . Mild iron plates may be fixed over the curb ( inner wall ) of the manger or recessed into curb wall in case the curb is made of reinforced cement concrete . Dimensions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Fig. 5.23 . A long pipe of suitable diameter shall be fitted all along the length of the manger just above and parallel to the inner wall of the manger , This pipe can be fixed in position // by means of a series of angle iron brackets ( see Fig. 5.23 ) jutting out from the roof supporting posts . This pipe prevents the animals from getting into the manger or jumping out over the manger and is very necessary in sheds for young animals ( Fig. 5.24 ) . Water Troughs Water troughs may be constructed with reinforced cement concrete , brick with cement mortar , stone slabs with cement jointing or plain thick G.I. sheets . The water tanks may be round ( generally in larger pens ) or rectangular and shall be located at convenient places in sheds as shown in different layouts . Its dimensions shall be more or less the same as that for mangers for different livestock ( as per specifications given in Table 5 ) . A two metre wide paved plat-form shall be provided adjacent to the water troughs to withstand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Details of round types of water troughs are shown in Fig. 5.25 . In smaller pens a tank can be made by raising an impervious partition towards one end of the continuous mangers . Hydrants Each water tank should have one hydrant the outflow from which may be controlled by a float valve . The hydrant can also be left without a tap and water let into the troughs at regular intervals so // that the water trough may get filled as the animals empty them . Hydrants with spouts to attach a hose should also be fixed in each shed at convenient places . The pens can be washed by flushing water through a hose . Drains Simple open type drains are most suited to loose houses . The drains should be located at about the junction of the covered and open areas . The drains shall be constructed out of the same materials as for the floor . The width of the drains may vary between 30 to 40 cm . A slope of 1 to 40 shall be provided to the drains . Shallow U-shaped drains with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drains with cut sides ( rectangular or triangular cross section ) . The drains in a row of pens should be made continuous by routing it through holes in intervening partition walls . Outside the building the drain may be led to a receptacle pit if it is desired to store this water . Otherwise the drains can directly be led into fields where fodders are grown . Gates and Passages There are two types of gates on a farm ? the one leading into individual pens and the gates on farm fences and roads . The latter should be wide enough to allow passage of trucks , tractors and carts . Similarly , there are passages leading to individual sheds or buildings and main farm roads . In general , the requirements of service passages arc similar regardless of the kind of animals . Accordingly , the suggestions given in Table 6 are equally applicable to cattle , sheep or swine farms . // Gates shall be made of iron or strong wood . Hinged gate ( Fig. 5.26 . I ) is better on animal farms . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shutting post by a hasp and staple . Double bar gates ( Fig. 5.26 . II ) are sometimes preferred for large animal sheds . Foot Bath and Spray Race These are important in protecting animals from contagious diseases and pests . A foot bath ( Fig. 5.27 ) is a tank 6 x 3 m at the bottom , 12 m x 4 m on top and 0.3 m deep and constructed near the entrance . This tank is filled with a germicidal solution . Animals and carts enter-ing and leaving the farm have to wade through this solution and in the process , the animals ' feet or the wheels of vehicles get dis-infected . Thus , no disease producing germs will be brought into the farm through incoming vehicles and animals . Spray races are for spraying insecticide solutions on animals for controlling insect pests . A spray race ( Fig. 5.28 ) is a 2.5 x 1.8 metre passage with a slope of 1 in 40 towards one end . Showers or sprayer nozzles are fixed overhead at a height of 2 metres above the platform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is kept rough to prevent the animals from slipping . Animals are taken on to the platform one by one along an enclosed passage and spraRousing // yed with insecticides or bactericides to protect them from flies , insects and bacteria . The excess liquid spray draining out of the platform can be collected in a tank and can be reused . Farm Fences A farm fence locates the boundary , protects the crops and pro perty from intruders , keeps the animals inside , sometimes serves as a shelter and improves the attractiveness and value of the farm . The fence must be light , strong and durable . The nature and size of holding , the crops raised , species of animals kept on the farm and materials available in the locality determine the type of fence . On farms fences are required for enclosing the farm premises , fields and pastures . Also , fences can be used instead of walls to en-close the open lots of animal sheds . Barbed wire fences are neces sary for enclosing farm area . For enclosing open lots of animal sheds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wooden poles , metal tubing , wooden boards or plain woven wire strands . Live thorny hedges can be used as farm fences in dry areas . A one and a half metre high earthern embankment along the boundary also ser ves as a good barrier . A wooden fence can be put up in areas where timber is cheap . It occupies less space and can easily be erec ted and removed . Wood should preferably be treated with creosote or other materials which process will prolong the life of the fence . Wooden fences are good for enclosing open lots of animal sheds . The fence can be of post-and-rail type with four or five 10 x 7.5 cm cross rails nailed to fence posts , 22 cm apart or a palisade type . Second-hand iron rails , angle irons or tubing can also be used for // fences . When iron is used the fence posts which should be two to three metres apart should be fixed in a firm bed of concrete . Wire fences , however , are more practical and longer lasting if done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wire are used for farm fences . Barbed wire should be used for fencing farm premises . It should be 1.5 metres high with 4 or 5 strands 0.4 to 0.3 metre apart . The line posts of fence should be three to four metres apart depending on the type of soil and material of posts . Details of wire fences for different animals are given in Table 7 . The end and corner posts of fences should be well fixed in a concrete bed and fur : her strengthened by a brace also fixed in concrete bed ( see Fig. 5.29 ) . Where a temporary enclosure is desired , such as enclosing pasture lots or when existing fences need bolstering from rougish or bossy animals it may be desirable to install an electric fence . Electric fences are hardly used in this country , nor are there any standard materials available for this . There is good scope for using electric fences where good pasture is available and grazing is practised . Animals can be confined to a lot on pasture for specific period by enclosing it by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fixed later around another lot after the first lot is fully grazed . The electric fence comprises of one or two strands of live wire ( one at 0.8 metre in height for adult cattle ; one at 0.4 metre in height for calves ; and two at 0.2 metre and 0.4 metre in heights for sheep ) fixed on wooden posts . As the animal comes in contact with the live wire the power gets earthed through the animal and it gets a // mild shock in the process . This discourages the animals from crossing the wire . Electric fences can be dangerous to men and animals . Fence controllers , wires , switches , etc. should be purchased from standard firms and got installed by experts . Men working on farms and people around should be educated about the wire fence and necessary safety precautions against accidents to both men and animals should be taken . // // M ORRISON defines nutrient as any food constituent , or group of food constituents of the same general chemical composition , that aids in the support of life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Water , proteins , carbohydrates , fats , minerals and vitamins are the well-recognised feed nutrients . Feed nutrients are to be ingested by the animals mainly for the following purposes : ( i ) providing necessary elements for repairing wear and tear of the body , ( ii ) providing raw materials for synthesis of body tissues in growth , ( iii ) serving as a source of energy for vital processes in the body , growth , work or production , ( ir ) for generating heat necessary for maintaining body temperature , and ( r ) serving as raw material for the production of milk , meat , egg or wool as the case may be . Water Water , the simplest of feed nutrients , plays an important role in almost all life processes . Being readily available and the cheapest , its importance is sometimes ignored . Animals require water for the formation of their bodies . Water acts as a medium and universal solvent in almost all vital processes like digestion , absorption , intermediary metabolism , excretion and even in reproduction . Water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and evaporation serves a major role in maintaining homeothermy of the animals . Water can absorb large quantity of heat with limited temperature change . Besides , animals get rid of a major portion of excess body heat evolved in metabolic processes through evaporating body water . Water also aids in maintaining the pH of body // fluids within normal range . Animals obtain water by drinking , as a constituent of feeds and through metabolic processes of the body . All feeds contain water . Succulent feeds like berseem contain as much as 90 per cent water . Dry feeds like hay straw and cereal grains on the other hand have 10-15 per cent water . When fats , carbohydrates and proteins are broken down in the body to liberate energy , water is produced as a byproduct . This is known as metabolic water . The quantity of free water that an animal requires varies with the water content of feeds it has received , the metabolic water avail-able , size and activity of the animal and the climatic conditions . Proteins The soft tissues and internal organs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transformation of food protein into body protein is a vital nutritional process which sustains growth and repair . A continuous liberal supply of proteins throughout life is necessary for this . Young animals require considerably more proteins for growth . Proteins are complex compounds , each molecule being composed of a considerable number of amino acids . The amino acids in each protein molecule is arranged in a particular definite pattern . Amino acids in a protein molecule have been compared to bricks in a wall . But , in this analogy , one should imagine that the bricks are of various size , shape and other qualities . The animals build their body proteins primarily from the amino acids absorbed from the digested dietary proteins . Absorption will not take place unless food proteins are broken down into amino acids . Twenty-four amino acids have been identified . Some or all of these may be combined in varying proportions and sequence to produce innumerable number of proteins . In order to synthesise a particular body protein in the animal system , all the amino acids required for it must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missing , all the rest will be wasted for tissue building and deaminated for liberating energy . The body has the capacity to convert surplus of some of the simpler amino acids into certain others . On the other hand , the large-animal tissues can not form certain amino acids from any other source . These are called essential amino acids which in the case of rats and pigs are : Lysine , Trjptophan , Histidine , Phenylal-anine , Leucine , Isoleucine , Threonine , Methionine , Valine and Argin-ine . Thesq. amino acids are , therefore , necessary for life and must // be supplied through feed in required quantities . The amino acids essential for one species are not necessarily so for another . The usage of terms essential ' and non-essential ' amino acids does not in any way imply that one group is more important than the other in metabolism or growth . The distinction only means that the essential amino acids have to be supplied from external sources as such . On the other hand , the non-essential amino acids missing in the diet can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain amino acids which assume more or less an intermediary position . The biosynthesis of these amino acids is slow so that it can only support life but not support active growth . An example is Arginine in pigs . Similarly , some of the non-essential amino acids have a sparing action on certain essential amino acids . Cystine can replace about one sixth of the Methionine requirement but has no growth effect in the absence of Methionine . Tyrosine can replace about one half of the Phenylalanine requirement . But it has no growth effect in the absence of Phenylalanine . The protein requirement of ruminants is entirely different from that of simple-stomached animals . The micro-organisms in the rumen are able to synthesise all amino acids from other amino acids and even from non-protein nitrogenous compounds . The pattern of protein metabolism is modified in the ruminant by the synthesis of microbial protein in the rumen . Ruminants digest these microbial proteins of high biological value in the intestines and absorb amino-acids . Even if the proteins in the diet of ruminants is of low biological value , lacking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ microbial protein of high biological value rich in all essential amino acids . Thus , the protein requirements are relatively simple for ruminants quality-wise . Besides , they are capable of utilising non-protein nitrogenous substances like urea to satisfy part of their protein needs . The rumen is non-functional in the new-born ruminant . Until the ru nen becomes fully functional , the protein requirements of the infant ruminant may be considered on par with simple-stomached animals . The protein in their diet may be carefully computed to contain the essential amino acids in the required quantity . Carbohydrates Carbohydrates form the major part of animals ' food . But none of them is found as such in the animal body , the only exceptions being glycogen and small amount of sugar . Derivatives of these compounds are present in the animal body in combination with // lipids or proteins . The term carbohydrate indicates the presence of carbon , hydrogen and oxygen , the latter two in the proportion as seen in water . These compounds are very important in nutrition of animals because they are the chief source of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and work . They also enable the animals to maintain their body temperature . Carbohydrates include sugars , starch , cellulose , hemicelluloses , pectins , gums and mucilages . Lignin is classified along with carbohydrates in feed analysis , even though it is not a true carbohydrate . The simplest of all the carbohydrates are the sugars which are sweet and soluble in water . They are classified into monosaccharides , disaccharides or trisaccharides depending on the number of sugar molecules present in them . Monosaccharides have five ( pentoses ) or six ( hexoses ) carbon atoms , in each molecule . Hexoses have the general formula C , HI , O , . They are more important in nutrition than pentoses having the general formula C , HloO , . Hexoses include glucose , fructose , galactose and mannose . Arbrinose , xylose and ribose are examples of pentoses . In nature we find certain compound sugars known as disaccharides . They are sucrose ( cane sugar ) , maltose ( malt sugar ) , lactose ( milk sugar ) and cellobiose . There are certain trisaccharides like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a polymer of glucose is a major component of animals ' diet . Plants store excess food nutrients as starch , as a reserve . Cereal grains like wheat , rice , sorghum and maize are rich in starch . So also are certain fruits like apples and tubers like potato , tapioca and yams . Starch is not soluble in water . But it is easily digested to sugars which are absorbed . Therefore , its food value is high . Cellulose is a more complex and less soluble and digestible carbohydrate . No known enzyme of large animals can digest cellulose . So , cellulose has a very limited role as a nutrient in the case of carnivorous and omnivorous animals . In them , it only aids in digestion because its bulk stimulates peristalsis and secretion of enzymes . It also opens up food materials thereby enhancing enzymatic activity . In ruminants and in other herbivores to a lesser extent , cellulose is a major food nutrient thanks to the intervention of microflora in rumen or caecum . Cellulose is broken down by the microbial enzyme cellulose . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caecum results in the formation of volatile fatty acids like acetic , propionic , butyric and valeric acids . These acids constitute the major source of energy for the ruminants . For // ruminants , cellulose has almost the same energy value as starch . Pentosans are complex pentoses . Grass hay and bran may have upto 20 per cent of pentosans . They are similar to starch as far as nutritional aspects are concerned . Lignin is a group of substances which are not chemically fully understood . They are found in the woody parts of plants . The process of lignification progresses as the plants mature more and more . Lignin is indigestible and often lignification takes place around cellulose fibres , thereby reducing the digestibility of cellulose also . Therefore , the stage of cutting plants for feeding animals is important . Any carbohydrate absorbed ( as sugar or volatile fatty acids ) in ? ; . excess of the body 's need for energy , is first converted into glycogen and stored in the liver . But , the capacity of liver ' to store carbohydrates as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is converted into fat and laid down in different regions in the body . Fats Feeds of plant and animal origin contain a group of substances insoluble in water and soluble in ether , benzine and chloroform . They come under the classification of fat , ether extract , or lipids . Fats in food serve as a source of energy . Dietary fats also find their way into milk or egg as their constituent . Excess fat is converted into depofat and stored in different parts of the body . Fats and oils are similar but for the difference that fats are solids and oils liquid at room temperature . Fats , like carbohydrates , incorporate carbon , hydrogen and oxygen in their molecules . But , hydrogen and oxygen are not in the proportion as they are present in water . The oxygen content of fats is much less and , therefore , on oxidation they liberate roughly 2.25 times more energy than carbohydrates . Apart from being a concentrated source of energy , fats aid in the absorption of vitamin A , carotene and calcium . Although fats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there has been an increasing realization in recent years that they play an essential role in the metabolic processes of the body , and that a certain minimum quantity in the diet is a must for health and well-being of animals . This is more so with young calves , lambs , pigs and chicks . Experiments on laboratory animals have shown that three uusat-grated fatty acids ( lenoleic , lenolenic and arachidonic ) are // essential for growth and health and that they can not be synthesised in the animal body . Whether these fatty acids are nutritionally essential in the diet of farm animals is not fully known . Available evidence indicates that they are not . Minerals The animal body contains a large number of mineral elements . Out of these , fifteen have been recognised as essential . They are calcium , phosphorus , sodium , chlorine , potassium , magnesium , manganese , iron , copper , cobalt , zinc , iodine , sulphur , molybdenum and seleneum . Apart from these , the animal system contains about 24 or more other elements . Some are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in food and partially retained by the animal 's body . On the other hand , some may have an essential role and might be required in micro quantities only . For example fluorine and chromium once considered as non-essential are now recognised as elements playing an essential role in the animal system . The role played by many trace elements in enzyme systems as constituents or activators is known in much detail now . Minerals play many a vital role in the animal system . As constituents of the skeletal tissue minerals impart rigidity and strength to it . Minerals also form part of the soft tissues and body fluids in the body . Nucleoproteins , which form the continuity from generation to generation , have phosphorus as a constituent . Phospholipids are an essential part of cell protoplasm . They also exert either stimulative or depressive effect on response and tonicity of muscles and irritability of nerves . Blood and other body fluids contain many minerals dissolved in them . These minerals are mostly responsible for maintaining proper osmotic pressure and acid-base balance in the system . Many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interactions . For example regular functioning of the heart is affected by the proportion of calcium , sodium and potassium in the fluid that surrounds it . Apart from this , the red blood corpuscles in blood are able to transport oxygen from lungs to the tissues and carbon dioxide from tissues to lungs due to the presence of haemoglobin which contains iron . Besides these general functions , each mineral has some specific functions also . Skeletal development in various species of farm animals is dependent on adequate calcium and phosphorus supply in the presence of vitamin D. A proper ratio between them is also important . // Calcium in blood plays an important role in blood clotting . Similarly , phosphorus is essential for phosphorylations in the course of intermediary metabolism of nutrients . Sodium , chlorine and potassium are mainly concerned with maintenance of acid-base balance and osmotic pressure in the animal body . They control water metabolism and influence passage of nutrients into cells . Besides , they have a role in transportation of respiratory gases . Magnesium has a role similar to calcium and phosphorus as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its nutritional role and metabolism are closely linked to those of calcium and phosphorus . Apart from the above mentioned , magnesium plays a vital role in many body processes especially as an activator in many enzymatic reactions . Manganese has an important role in skeletal development and growth and in reproduction . Iron is an essential part of the respiratory pigment haemoglobin . It is also a component in cytochrome , catalase , peroxidase and certain other enzymes . This mineral , even though present in the animal body in quantities less than 0.005 per cent , plays a very vital role affecting all life processes , being a constituent of oxygen carriers and oxidising enzymes or catalysts . Copper , another element required in much less quantities than iron , plays an important role in haemoglobin synthesis and red cell maturation . Presence of copper is necessary for the utilisation of iron . Copper is also a constituent of some of the enzymes like cytochrome oxidase , catalase , tyrosinase and ascorbic acid oxidase . Cobalt is a constituent of vitamin B12 and ruminants can synthesise the vitamin if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Therefore , cobalt is an essential mineral for ruminants . In non-ruminants , vitamin B12 has to be provided as such in the ration and cobalt in the ration can do very little help to spare the vitamin . Zinc plays an important role in keratinisation and calcification and as a constituent of many important enzymes it has an essential role . Iodine forms about 65 per cent of the hormone thyroxine of thyroid gland which regulates the development of the animal and the metabolic rate . Even though this element is present in less than one in two millionth part in the animal body , its absence in required amounts in the diet can cause disastrous consequences . Body contains comparatively larger quantities of sulphur , even // though almost all of it is in the organic form . The body can utilise mostly the organic sulphur which is part of the amino acids , methionine and cystine . However , rumen bacteria can synthesise these amino acids in the presence of inorganic sulphur . This process is of some significance when part of the nitrogen requirement is met through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the organic form . Sulphur is also part of insulin and glutathione which regulate metabolism . Molybdentun his been recognised for long as an agent that causes toxicity . But only recently it has been found that molybdenum in traces is an essential nutrient . It is a constituent of xanthine oxidase , an enzyme involved in purine metabolism . Poultry need more molybdenum as they need more xanthine oxidase in uric acid formation . Mostly , the need for this element is met through normal feeding and deficiency is very rare . Rather , the problem often is from excess of the element causing toxicity . Selenium in trace quantities is an essential nutrient in spite of its well-known toxic effect in larger dozes which cause alkali disease ' or blind staggers . This mineral has a role in preventing infant mortality and enhancing growth . Besides it prevents white muscle disease . Flourine , though toxic in larger dozes , has been found to reduce the incidence of dental caries in human beings . Other studies on farm animals could not establish an essential role for this . Similarly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of excess sugar . But the question whether it is an essential element or not has yet to be established . Vitamins Till the beginning of twentieth century , the generally established belief was that carbohydrates , proteins , fats , and minerals were the only essential nutrients , even though towards the end of 19th century many isolated discoveries in the field of nutrition were shaking the basis of this belief . During the turn of the century , F.G . Hopkins concluded that apart from the proximate principles , certain other organic substances in smaller amounts were necessary for life . These substances were later on designated as vitamins . It must be understood at this level that the vitamins as a group do not constitute a chemical entity ; on the contrary , most of them are chemically unrelated . However , considering them as a group is meaningful from the physiological and nutritional points of view . The field of vitamins is a very active one and by no means the // existing knowledge in the field a complete one . There are about 13 and odd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be discovered and the knowledge on the recognised ones extended in the coming years . Thus , most of the knowledge on vitamins lies in the future . Water Soluble and Fat Soluble Vitamins Vitamins are generally classified into water soluble and fat soluble vitamins depending on their solubility in water and fats . Members of the B-complex and vitamin C belong to the category of water soluble vitamins whereas vitamins A , D , E and K form the fat soluble group . Vitamins B-complex group include thiamine ( BO , riboflavin ( B ) , vitamin B ; ; ( pyridoxine , pyridoxamine and pyridoxal ) , niacin , pantothenic acid , biotin , folic acid , choline and cyanocobalamine ( B12 ) . Thiamine , as a constituent of the coenzyme carboxylase and otherwise plays an important role in intermediary metabolism . When this vitamin is deficient , many metabolic processes can not progress beyond a stage and some of the intermediary products accumulate in the tissues causing the deficiency symptoms . Beriberi in man , polyneuritis in birds and chastek paralysis in foxes are characteristic symptoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage of it . In pigs and poultry , the deficiency causes loss of appetite , stunted growth and emaciation . In addition pigs will show vomiting , nervous symptoms , subnormal body temperature and slow pulse . In birds , polyneuritis with frequent convulsions develop at a later stage . This vitamin is a metabolic essential for all species of animals and plants . It is a dietary essential in all animals except ruminants in which it is synthesised by the micro-organisms in the rumen . Riboflavin , relatively thermoduric in comparison to thiamine , is another vitamin which plays many essential roles in the intermediary metabolism and assimilation of nutrients . This is required to form many flavoprotein enzymes and coenzymes which act at important stages in the metabolic release of food energy in the body . " curled-toe paralysis " and diarrhoea are common symptoms of deficiency in chicken . In pigs , thickened dermatitic skin , distorted and stiffened legs and eye lesions develop . Riboflavin is essential for all the animals . But , in the ruminants , since the rumen bacteria synthesise them in adequate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B , ( pyridoxine , pyridoxamine and pyridoxal ) plays a vital role in several enzyme systems concerned with metabolism of // protein . Tryptophane will not be completely metabolised in the absence of this vitamin . This vitamin like other B-vitamins is a metabolic essential for ruminants . But , it is not essential in the diet of ruminants after the development of rumen because the microbial synthesis Hill suffice the requirement of these animals . This is a dietary essential in the diets of chicken and pigs and deficiency in ' the feed will cause lowered appetite , stunted growth and nervous symptoms . Niacin ( Nicotinamide ) is essential metabolically for all species of animals as it forms part of two important co-enzymes ? co-enzyme I ( NAD ) and co-enzyme II ( NADP ) . These co-enzymes are involved in a series of reactions in the metabolism of all nutrients , in which biological oxidation-reduction reactions take place . Thanks to microbial synthesis in the rumen , it is not a dietary necessity for ruminants . In other species like poultry and pigs , this vitamin is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In these species the requirement of the vitamin in the diet depends on the availability of tryptophan rich protein . On a liberal protein rich ration they require very little niacin in the diet . If both niacin and tryptophan ( in amounts required for protein synthesis and niacin formation ) are deficient in diet of pigs , dogs and poultry , deilciency symptoms develop . Pantothenic acid is another B-vitamin essential in the diet of pigs , poultry , dogs , etc. , but non-essential in the diet of ruminants due to microbial synthesis . In horses and rabbits most of the requirement is met from intestinal synthesis . This vitamin forms part of co-enzyme-A , which is essential for the nutrients to enter the tricarboxilic acid cycle in metabolism . Besides this , the vitamin has other metabolic functions also . Its deficiency causes stunted growth and skin and epithelial derangements resulting in gastro-intestinal and reproductive disorders . Its deficiency also causes nervous symptoms . Biotin is another essential B-vitamin which is part of many enzyme systems in intermediary metabolism . In ruminants , synthesis by micro-organisms takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is considerable synthesis in the intestine and there is no evidence at present indicating dietary deficiencies in any species of farm animals . However , in poultry a dietary need of the vitamin has been established . Feeding of raw egg-white has been found to produce biotin deficiency in many species due to the presence of avidin in raw egg-white which makes dietary biotin unavailable . Folic acid is yet another important member of the B-complex // group of vitamins . It is essential in the diet of poultry and most of the laboratory animals . Due to rumen synthesis , it is not essential in the diet of adult ruminants , although for infants , until rumen develops fully , it is essential . In pigs and rats intestinal synthesis of the vitamin meets their need . Folic acid plays an important role in intermediary metabolism . Choline is another nutrient classed as a B-vitamin . It is essential for the formation of cell structure . It also plays a role in fat metabolism of liver . Choline forms part of acetylcholine which has an important role in transmission of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pigs , dogs and young calves and Iambs . Vitamin B12 ( Cyanocobalamine ) is a metabolic essential for all species of animals . It is synthesised in the rumen by micro-organisms , provided cobalt is available in required amounts . It is a dietary essential in non-ruminants and young ruminants . Vitamin B11 prevents and cures pernicious anaemea in human beings . It has varied roles to play in intermediary metabolism and it enhances growth and reduces the requirement of protein of growing animals . Vitamin C is essential in the diet of only guinea pig , monkey and man , even though it is a metabolic essential for all species . Pigs have been shown to synthesise the vitamin in their gastro-intestinal tract . In cattle , on a vitamin A-deficient diet , there are evidences of reduced synthesis of vitamin C and deficiency of the same can develop . Vitamin A , an essential nutrient in the diet of all animals , is fat soluble . This vitamin is available from plant sources as its precursor , carotene . The animal body has the capacity to convert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintenance of healthy epithelial tissue throughout the body . When there is vitamin A deficiency , the epithelium becomes keratinized and thereby , susceptible to attack from invading micro-organisms . Thus , the epithelium of eye and respiratory , reproductive and alimentary tracts get affected with corresponding symptoms . Vitamin A is necessary for the resynthesis of visual purple in the physiological reactions taking place in sight . Deficiency of vitamin A will result in night blindness in all species . Animals have the capacity to store large amounts of this vitamin in liver . This is of practical importance because if the animals have access to vitamin A rich feed during lush seasons , they will not suffer from deficiency for the following five to six months even if they are fed vitamin A deficient diets . Vitamin D , another fat soluble vitamin , has a major role in calcium and phosphorus metabolism . Its main role is to increase the // absorption of calcium from the alimentary tract . Deficiency of the vitamin causes rickets in all species . Sunlight can convert body ergosterol into vitamin D. Similarly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of vitamin D. In the tropics and sub-tropics enough of ultraviolet rays fall on the animals for synthesis of the vitamin in adequate level . However , in temperate regions , especially during winter , this vitamin can become a dietary necessity . Vitamin E ( Tocopherols ) is important for the health of reproduc-tive system in rats and mice . But , in farm animals , attempts to find out any relation between reproductive disorders and vitamin E deficiency has failed , except in poultry where hatchability of eggs is reduced . Muscular dystrophy has been produced in many species due to vita-min E deficiency . Many times this may affect the cardiac muscles also . In spite of extensive research in the field , a concrete metabolic role has not been assigned to tocopherols . Many scientists were stri-ving to find a possible common physiological link between diverse pathological lesions and symptoms observed in vitamin E deficiency . The present belief is that tocopherols act as antioxidants , prevent-ing oxidation of other vitamins and essential constituents both in the intestine and in the tissues . Thus , lack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their characteristic symptoms . Vitamin K is involved in the coagulation of blood . When defici-ent , the coagulation time of blood is increased . Even though the exact role of the vitamin is not known , it is understood that the vitamin is required for the synthesis of prothrombin and plasma proteins in the liver . This vitamin is a physiological necessity for all species . But , it assumes an essential dietary role only in birds . In other species adequate amounts are synthesised by bacteria in the alimentary tract . COMMON FEEDS AND FODDERS Pastures Many species of livestock like cattle , buffaloes , sheep , goats and horses can meet almost all their requirements by grazing on good pastures ( see Fig. 6.1 ) . Pigs and poultry can also derive a certain proportion of their nutrients through pasturing . Pastures are com-paratively economical for animal feeding . Wherever grazing lands are available this system is the cheapest and should be encouraged . About 90 per cent of the livestock population in India subsists on naturally growing grasses . In 1951-52 out of 320 million hec128 Farm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of land were classified as grasslands . Except in and around forests , most of these so-called pastures are denuded by overgrazing and are not worth that name . They have to be fenced , cultivated with pasture grasses and legumes and subjected to controlled grazing to be of any significant value . Roughages Feeds with a higher proportion of crude fibre or non-digestible material are grouped together under the general term , roughage . This may be further classified into succulent and dry roughages depending on the moisture content . Succulent roughages are further classified into green fodder and silage . Green fodder includes leguminous fodder and non-leguminous fodder . Leguminous fodder consists of the stem and leaves of a group of plants belonging to the group Leguminosae . These plants , by virtue of bacteria of Rhizobium group in their root nodules , fix ' nitrogen from atmosphere and make it available to themselves , other plants , to animals and to man . They always have a higher nitrogen content and can form a major source of protein to farm animals . For cattle and buffaloes if legumes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ additional supply of protein . Legumes of importance as fodder crops include true clovers ( Trifolium species ) , Medics ( Medicago species ) , Crotalaria species and certain other miscellaneous legumes . Important true clovers useful as fodder crops are Berseem ( Trifolium alexandrimnn ) ( see Fig. 6.2 A ) , shaftal ( T. resupinatum ) , White clover ( T. repens ) , Red clover ( T. pratense ) , Crimson clover ( T. incarnatum ) , Alsike clover ( T. hybridum ) and Subterranean clover ( T. subterraneum ) . Among medics , Lucerne ( Medicago saliva ) , is the most popular fodder crop . Black medic ( M. lupulina ) and Bur clover ( M. hispida ) are other members of utility as fodder . Crotalaria group includes a large number of species useful for foraging like Sunnhemp ( Crotalaria juncea ) , Cow pea ( Vigna sinensis ) ( see Fig. 6.2 B ) and Kudzu vine ( Pueraris thunbergiana ) . Certain other legumes like soyabeans ( Glycene soya ) are also important in livestock feeding . Non-Leguminous Roughages Non-leguminous fodder generally contains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-leguminous fodder , special care has to be taken to add sufficient protein-rich concentrates // to balance the ration . They include many cereal fodder crops , perennial cultivated grasses , some indigenous grasses and introduced grasses . Important members of cereal crops used as fodder are Maize ( Zea mays ) ( see Fig. 6.2 C ) , Sorghum ( Sorghum vulgare ) , Bajra ( Pennisetum typhoides ) ( see Fig. 6.2 D ) , Oats ( Avena Sativa ) ( see Fig. 6.2 E ) and Teosinte ( Euchlaena mexicana ) .

They are at various levels of trial and introduction in the country and some of them offer good promise . There are many more species of fodder crops in the country . For a comprehensive review the reader is referred to Forage Crops in India ' by Narayanan and Dabadghao ( 1972 ) . Concentrates They are feed materials usually having low moisture and fibre content with relatively more digestibility . With regard to their protein content they can be further classified into protein-low ( basal ) and protein-rich concentrates . Basal concentrates include all the grains and some of their by-products . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus , they can be used in the ration of livestock mainly as a source of energy . This does not mean that they do not supply any protein . Often , the protein present in grains is highly digestible . But the proportion of protein present is low in them . Among the grains , maize , oats , jowar and barley are the most important . Use of wheat as a livestock feed has been banned by law . Only when it is spoiled in storage and , therefore , unfit for human consumption , // it can be used as an animal feed . These grains are rich in total digestible nutrients but have deficiencies which must be corrected by the addition of other feed stuffs . For example maize is deficient in two essential amino acids , viz. , tryptophan and lysine . The former is abundantly present in oil cakes and the latter in animal proteins or soyabean oil meal . Protein-rich concentrates have a greater proportion of protein as a constituent . They may be of plant or animal origin . Protein-rich concentrates of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pulses and grams like cow-pea , black gram , horse gram and Bengal gram form an important group of protein-rich concentrates of plant origin . But , since most of them are used for human consumption , their utility as an animal feed is limited and reliance has to be placed mostly on by-products . Oil cakes like groundnut cake , linseed cake , coconut cake , cotton seed cake and rape seed cake and rice bran are important by-products of this group . They are usually deficient in some essential amino acids and vitamin By , . These deficiencies can be corrected by adding concentrates of animal origin . The important animal proteins in livestock feeding are by-products like tankage , fish meal , meat meal , dried skim milk and dried butter milk . They supply certain essential amino acids like lysine which are deficient in feeds of plant origin . Similarly , these feeds are good sources of vitamin Bh which is absent in feeds of plant origin . Therefore , a certain proportion of animal proteins in the rations of monogasiric animals is a must for balanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the ruminal synthesis takes care of the demand for these essential food nutrients . NUTRITIVE VALUE OF FEEDS The nutritive value of a feed is determined by finding out the quantity of various nutrients present in it , which will be available to the animal for maintenance , growth and/or production . This has to be determined with respect to energy , protein , minerals and vitamins . The simplest and earliest method of determining the nutritive value of feeds was to estimate the composition of the feed with respect to various nutrients . It was soon found that large amounts of nutrients are lost through faeces and that the nutritive value of a feed stuff is more accurately judged when the digestible nutrients are taken into account . As a consequence , the feeding trial and digestibility trial techniques were developed ( see Fig. 6.3A ) . // Innumerable digestibility trails have been conducted the world over to determine the digestible nutrients in various livestock feeds for all different species and classes of livestock under different conditions and activities ( see Fig. 6.3 B ) . The different values @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ N.R.C. , Sen and Ray and some others . These values are even now extensively used for computing rations for livestock . The most important purpose to which feed nutrients are put is the production of energy and feed intake is , therefore , almost sy nonymous with energy intake . The concept of total digestible nutri ents which is the sum of all digestible organic nutrients ? carbohy drates , protein and fats ( the latter being multiplied by 2.25 because of the fact that it has 2.25 times more energy content than the former two ) represents the approximate energy value of a feed . These nutrients may be immediately used for energy or stored as glycogen or fat or get incorporated into the body tissue . Whenever there is shortage , energy stored in the form of glycogen or fat will be mobilised and when these sources are exhausted body proteins will be deaminated and used for energy purposes . Thus , every organic nutrient except vitamins is a source of energy . Besides , many nutri ents like vitamins and trace minerals are required because of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeds not only supply energy , but also other essential specific nutri ents , augmenting energy consumption through increased feed intake often corrects other deficiencies that would have been there had the feed intake been low . A feed nutrient , however much rich in energy it might be , will be of very little value nutritionally , unless it is absorbed , metabolis ed and made available for vital life processes . Thus , petrol or diesel // oil which are rich sources of energy are of little utility as livestock feed since they are not digested and utilised in the body . The first step in evaluating nutritional value of feeds was to measure the absorbed or digestible ' portion of the total gross energy . By calculating the energy voided in faeces and subtracting it from gross energy one obtains the apparent digestible energy . It is qualified apparent ' because the faecal energy deducted includes not only undigested feed matter , but also metabolic products like bile , digestive juices , desquamated epithelial wall , etc . When nutritional tools became more and more perfect , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the animal as com-bustible gases and urinary energy . The gases of digestion consist of methane mainly and traces of hydrogen and hydrogen sulphide . Loss of energy through this avenue is of any major significance only in the ruminants . Energy is lost through urine of the order of two to three per cent of gross energy by the excretion of incom-pletely oxidised non-protein nitrogenous compounds like urea and uric acid . When these two categories of energy are subtracted from apparent digestible energy , one arrives at metabolisable energy . The metabolisable energy represents the proportion of total energy that can be metabolised in the body for maintenance , growth , produc-tion and activity and for producing heat to maintain body tempera-ture . It has been observed that the heat production from fermentation and intermediary metabolism are often in excess of the animal 's needs depending on the environmental temperature . This energy is lost to the animal as heat , which can not be utilised for production or work to a major degree . This heat increment ? or food utilisation tax ? is also unavailable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been subtracted from metabolisable energy to arrive at net energy values . Net energy has been formulated by Armsby as the maximum proportion of feed energy convertible to work , milk , egg , meat and maintenance . Thus , this is the part of energy that is available to the animal for maintenance , growth and production . Out of this , the maintenance energy which corresponds with the energy for basal metabolism is more or less constant for an animal . The remaining portion of net energy can be transformed into the desired product and is termed the net energy for production ( NEp ) . It should always be indicated which is the product in question such as : The efficiency of conversion of NEp in a productive process is about 100 per cent . Therefore , if the NEp of a feed is known precisely , this can be the most accurate estimate of its feeding value . This is the direction in which modern nutrition is progressing and within the near future net energy values of different feeds for diffe-rent classes of livestock will be available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represents more or less the net energy . Starch equivalent values represent the quantity of starch that will yield as much energy to the body above maintenance needs as would 100 pounds of the feed in question . It is calculated as under : Protein Value of Feeds Protein serves some special uses in the body like synthesis of body tissues and as components of products of economic importance like milk , egg , wool , etc . Therefore , special mention of the nutritive worth of the protein component of a feed , as different from its use as an energy source in energy estimations , is necessary . The total quantity of proteins and the amino acid composition of the proteins in a feed are both important in nutrition . For the synthesis of proteins in the body , all the amino acids that form part of that protein together with sufficient energy should be simultaneously present . Body has the capacity to synthesise simpler amino acids from other amino acids . But the essential amino acids , which can not be synthesised in the body from other substances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if one of the essential amino acids required in the synthesis of a body protein is absent , all the other amino acids will be deaminated and used for energy purpose and thereby wasted for protein synthesis . There is a large amount of published data indicating that imbalances in the amino acid make-up of the ration result in minor to serious nutritional disturbances even if the total nitrogen requirement is met . This aspect of protein nutrition , i.e , the relative usefulness of the protein in a feed for meeting specific functions of protein in the body , is referred to as protein quality , // Digestible crude protein ( DCP ) indicates the percentage of digestible protein in a feed . This refers to only the quantity of pro-tein in the feeds and tells nothing about its quality . Nutritive ratio is calculated to highlight the worth of a feed as a protein source vis-a-vis other nutrients . It is the ratio of digestible protein to the sum of digestible carbohydrates and fat , the latter being multiplied by 2.25 . This is calculated as follows : RV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 , ? NB2 nitrogen balance for feed 2 , N1 ? average nitrogen intake . This value indicates how far inferior or superior one protein is in its quality ' to another . When compared to egg or milk proteins ( with a biological value approaching 100 ) the egg or casein re-placement values have about the same numerical values as biological value . Chemical score method determines the quality of a protein by considering the relative amounts of amino acids present in the pro-tein according to chemical analysis . Block and Mitchell in their It must be understood that the class of animal , age , physiological state and production will influence the effective biological value of proteins . Protein replacement values are employed to describe the relative protein quality ' of two feed-stuffs under similar conditions . Nitrogen intake from the two feed-stuffs are kept essentially the same in two balance studies . The difference between the nitrogen balances ( retention ) is expressed as a percentage of total average nitrogen intake . The complement of this percentage is the relative value of the protein examined . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for expressing the quality of proteins in quantitative terms have resulted in the development of expressions like biological value , protein replacement value and chemical score . The ability of a particular feed to supply necessary amino acids in the relative amounts needed for protein synthesis is referred to as its biological value . It is calculated as given below : // scheme of chemical score for protein quality take into account only he amino acid which is in greatest deficit compared to egg protein . Dser 's Essential Amino Acid Index ( EAA Index ) on the other hand rakes into account the deficit of all the 10 essential amino acids in comparison to egg protein . supplementary Role of Proteins When the protein requirements of animals are met from many different protein sources , the deficiency in one is likely to be covered by another and so on . This supplementary role played by each other will increase the feeding value of the total protein in the diet . The importance of including proteins fronl.different sources in the ration Df non-ruminants has to be seen in this light . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their infant stage , are capable of acquiring the essential amino acids through symbiotic microbial synthesis , irrespective of the protein quality of their ration . In the feeding of ruminants , therefore , proLein quality is irrelevant . All that one has to know is the total digestible protein content of the feed . An ideally computed ration for all non-herbivores should take into account individual essential amino acid content and total digestible protein . It will be useful to group feed stuffs according to the nature and deficiencies of their protein . Such a practice would help one to avoid selecting several feeds with common deficiencies . THE PROCESS OF FEEDING To understand the food requirement of animals precisely , one should understand the process of feeding . Feeding starts with the animal carrying the food material to the mouth ( prehension ) followed by chewing ( mastication ) , swallowing ( deglutition ) , chewing the cud ( regurgitation , in ruminants only ) , digestion and absorption . Digestion Digestion includes all the mechanical and enzymatic processes which take place in the alimentary tract by which food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into relatively simple chemical compounds which are mostly soluble in water for absorption . Reducing particle size mechanically will increase the surface area for enzymes digestive juices to act . Enzymes are organic catalysts which have been found to be proteins. // There are large differences in the digestive process in different types of animals . There are anatomical and physiological adap tations according to the requirements of their feeding nature . The digestive processes vary accordingly . The maximum difference is seen in the digestion between ruminants and non-ruminants . Digestion in the non-rwninants . The digestive tract in the non-ruminant is simple with a simple stomach . In the carnivorous ani mals , man and dog , the large intestine is small . In omnivorous animals like pigs the caecum and colon are increased in size . Herbi vorous non-ruminants show even greater development of caecum and colon ( see Fig. 6.4 A ) . The monosaccharides like glucose in feed are absorbed without digestion . Other carbohydrates like starch , glycogen and dextrin are acted upon by salivary and pancreatic enzymes which will con vert them into maltose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the small intestine before absorption . Disaccharides like lactose and sucrose are hydrolysed by enzymes of small intestine to their constituent monosaccharides . The digestibility of starch varies with the species of animal and the source of starch . Enzymes of protein digestion arc secreted by the mucosa of // stomach and small intestine and the pancreas . These enzymes ulti mately break down proteins into amino acids . There are evidences that the availability of amino acids from digestion varies and if an essential amino acid is liberated to a lesser degree in protein diges tion , than the overall protein , the quality of the protein is lessened accordingly . These variations in digestibilities result from structural differences in the proteins , either natural or as a result of feed treatment . Natural fats ( triglycerides ) and other lipids are acted upon by enzymes of fat digestion produced by the mucous membranes of stomach and the pancreas . The end products of lipid digestion are monoglycerides , fatty acids and glycerol . Hydrolysis of neutral fats to fatty acids and glycerol occurs only to a limited extent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and emulsifying fats which in turn will aid in their enzymatic hydrolysis. // Digestion in the Ruminants information on the process of digestion and nutritive value of feeds obtained from studies on non-ruminants has no significance for ruminants . The whole story of microbial digestion in these animals needs a different assessment ( Fig. 6.4 B ) . The herbivores generally have an expanded part of digestive system so as to hold the bulky fibrous feed and delay their passage to undergo microbial fermentation . In ruminants this enlarged part is represented by the rumen which is the biggest compartment in their four-celled stomach ( Fig. 6.5 A ) . The rumen can be pictured as a large fermentation vat which provides an appropriate environment for the continuous culture of microbial population consisting of large numbers of bacteria and protozoa . There is a symbiotic existence between the ruminant and the micro-organisms by which both are benefited ( Fig. 6.5 B ) . The micro-organisms are benefited as follows : ( i ) Ingestion of feed by the animal ensures a sure and steady supply of nutrients to the micro-organisms. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanisms of animal between 38 ? - 40 ? C. This is ideal for the growth of micro-organisms and they flourish as if grown in an incubator . The end-products of microbial degradation are removed from the site of fermentation by absorption and passage to lower intestines . The end-products , therefore , do not accumulate and inhibit further enzymatic digestion and microbial growth . The pH and ionic composition of the rumen is maintained within narrow limits favourable for microbial growth by the secre tion of large volumes of saliva by the ruminants which is rich in bicarbonate and other ions . The micro-organisms on the other hand help and modify the digestive process in the ruminants to the benefit of those animals as under : ( 1 ) Cellulose , which is not amenable to digestion by any of the enzymes secreted by the large animals , is acted upon by the cellu lose splitting enzyme , ceilulase , elaborated by the micro-organisms . Cellulose , pentosans and starch are hydrolysed to monosaccharides and then fermented to volatile fatty acids ( VFA ) . Acetic acid forms 65 to 75 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members of rumen VFA are propionic acid ( 20% ) and butyric acid ( 9% ) . Traces of other acids like formic , valeric , isobutyric , isovaleric and 2-methyl butyric acids have also been found in the rumen . The // important differences in carbohydrate digestion in ruminants from that of non-ruminants are that : ( i ) cellulose is utilised , ( ii ) the digestion is mainly microbial and , ( iii ) the end-products are VFAs and not glucose . ( 2 ) Proteins are attacked by bacteria and the end-products are usually ammonia and short chain fatty acids . Simultaneously , a synthetic process also takes place in which not only amino acids , but simple nitrogenous substances like ammonia are made use of to manufacture cell proteins of the micro-organisms . A considerable proportion of the protein needs of the animals are met through such microbial protein . These micro-organisms ultimately pass from the rumen to the lower stomach and intestines where digestion of the microbial protein takes place in the same way as protein is digested in non-ruminants . The most important result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dietary protein is converted into bacterial protein in substantial quantities . In this process , many essential amino acids are synthesised de novo , from the nonessential ones or simple nitrogenous substances . Thus , even if the animal is fed protein of poor biological value , it is converted into high quality microbial protein . Therefore , in the feeding of ruminants , quality of protein is not of much significance provided the total quantity is met . Besides , the micro-organisms have the capacity to incorporate nitrogen present in non-protein nitrogenous ( NPN ) substances like . ammonia and urea , into their cell protein . This gives us the option to feed part of the nitrogen requirement of ruminants as urea or similar NPN. ( 3 ) Vitamins belonging to the B-complex group are dietary essentials for non-ruminants . But in the ruminants they are synthesised by the rumen microflora in sufficient quantities to meet all the dietary needs . In other herbivores a similar synthesis to a lesser degree takes place in the large intestine . This may not meet all the requirements and some dietary supplementation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of transferring digested food material from the gut across the mucous membrane of the alimentary tract to blood and through it to various parts of the body . In certain cases instead of blood it may be through l ; mph ( Fig.6.6 ) . Absorption of carbohydrates in monogastric animals is mainly in the form of monosaccharides , especially glucose . Small amounts of these sugars may be absorbed from the stomach . But almost all the monosaccharides of carbohydrate digestion are produced in the // intestine . These are absorbed by the small intestinal wall . After entering blood in the capillaries of intestinal villi , they reach liver by way of portal vein . In the liver these simple sugars get converted into glycogen . This glycogen will be slowly converted back to glucose and metabolised according to the needs of the body . In the ruminants , the endproducts of carbohydrate metabolism are volatile fatty acids These fatty acids are absorbed from rumen , reti-culum , ornasum and large intestine . By far , the maxi-mum absorption takes place in the rumen itself . Acetic , propionic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Proteins are broken down to amino acids which are readily solu ble in water . They are readily absorbed by the villi of small intes tinal wall . After absorption , they are carried through blood to different parts of the body where they serve primarily as the raw material for tissue building . The absorption of lipids from the intestines is in different ways . Lower fatty acids and choline which are soluble in water are absor bed by the intestinal villi . Monoglycerides and insoluble fatty acids are made into an emulsion with the help of bile salts . This colloidal complex enters the epithelial cells of small intestine . The epithelial cells resynthesise triglycerides from monoglycerides and fatty acids having 14 or more carbon atoms . These triglycerides join with small amounts of cholesterol and phospholipids to form colloidal com plexes known as chylomicrons . These chylomicrons mix with lymph to form chyle and enter the systemic circulation through the thoracic duct . The short chain fatty acids , on the other hand , are directly absorbed into the portal circulation . FEEDING STANDARDS Scientists have come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properly balanced rations for meeting the nutrient requirements of various types and classes of livestock . These recommendations have been collected , classified , tabulated and revised from time to time and have come to be known as // feeding standards . Thus , feeding standards are tables stating the amount of various nutrients that should be present in the daily ration of different classes of livestock for optimum results in growth , work and production . A modern feeding standard is evolved on the basis of many feeding trials . This undesirable feature of feeding standards , that they are formulated by assembling scattered data from studies conducted at different experimental stations under different conditions , to a large extent , is unavoidable . The concept of feeding standards originated in Germany as early as 1810 when Thaer developed his hay values ' . Greuven in 1859 was the first to formulate feeding standards based on the proximate analysis of feed stuffs . Another German scientist Wolff and later Lehmann from the same country developed Wolff 's standards and Wolf-Lehmann standards based on digestible nutrients . This line was picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States and was further developed . These have finally found expression as Morrison Standards and have been revised from time to time . It may , however , be stated here that the evolution of feeding standards has been more a matter of additions than change in the original quantities . Present Morrison Standards include requirements in the form of dry matter , digestible protein and total digestible nutrients . He has given a range in these figures instead of only one figure . The standards also include net energy values , requirements of calcium , phosphorus and carotene . Atwater proposed feeding standards based on the " available fuel values " calculated by applying Rubner 's factors to digested nutrients . Feeding standards based on net energy values were first proposed by Kellner in Germany , the net energy being expressed as starch equivalents . On the same lines , Armsby from USA proposed a feeding standard where net energy values were stated in therms . In both these feeding standards protein requirements were expressed as digestible true protein . Somehow these were not widely accepted . Work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going on in many laboratories and , therefore , any feeding standard is bound to become obsolete in a few years . Consequently , it has been realised that these standards must be revised every few years to make them up-to-date in describing nutritionally adequate ration . The NRC series of feeding standards is the direct result of this realization . These standards include recommendations on minerals and vitamins and amino acids wherever it is relevant , in addition to protein and energy requirements . It is believed that the NRC // reports representing the pooled judgement of experts in the field of each species of farm animals should be considered as the most authoritative statements of the nutritional needs of farm animals in USA and Canada . The British Agricultural Research Council has prepared BARC Nutrient Requirements of Farm Livestock on similar lines for feeding livestock in UK . Similar standards are available in Scandinavian and other European countries . Sen and Ray have come out with a feeding standard of Indian animals which has been published by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research as a bulletin ( No. 25 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are based on inadequate experimental data . Therefore , it is needed that experiments on these lines should be widely carried out and the results formulated into suitable feeding standards for animals in India . There are no feeding standards available for buffaloes and feeding standards developed for cattle are being used indiscriminately for these animals . Buffaloes being the mainstay of dairying in this country , it is in our interest to develop suitable feeding standards for these animals . The first consideration in feeding standards should be the capacity of the animal to consume feed . This is measured by the total dry matter in the daily ration which could be eaten by the animal . Usually the dry matter intake is proportionate to the body weight . Cattle generally eat 2.0 to 2.5 kg of dry matter per 100 kg live weight . Buffaloes eat slightly more than this . As a general rule twothirds of the nutrients should come from roughages and one-third from concentrates . After having determined the dry matter need , the next step is to find out the need of various nutrients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ includes growth , work , gestation and breeding apart from milk production , egg production , etc . Maintenance Requirements An animal , even when it is not doing any work or yielding any product , will still he expending some energy in the essential physiological processes of life . Added to this , there is the energy required for repairing wear and tear of living tissues as well as energy spent in incidental muscular movements . The portion of an animal 's ration which would cater to the above needs is termed as the maintenance ration . It has been defined as the feed which would provide the energy and also the materials for resting non-producing animal to keep it in normal health and maintain a constant body weight for an indefinite period . The maintenance requirement of // an animal is not directly proportional to its body weight . It has been observed that the maintenance requirement is in relation to the metabolic body size of the animal which is a function of live weight ( live weight 0 ' 73 ) . The metabolic size is approximately equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requirements of dairy cattle as recommended in various feeding standards are given in Tables 1 and 2 in Appendix-A . Nutritive Requirements for Growth Growth requires synthesis of new body tissue and the raw material for the same has to be provided through food . In animals used as meat , growth is synonymous to production . In animals like dairy cattle reared for other purposes , the ultimate production in adulthood is influenced by the growth attained by the animal . Although the maximum adult size and development are determined by heredity , nutrition determines their attainability and the tissue required to attain them . Thus , an animal can be fed to maintain a particular growth rate ( within limits ) depending on economic needs . Feeding standards give recommendations for optimum growth at a particular body weight . These figures are inclusive of maintenance requirements . The standards recommended by NRC and Sen and Ray for growing dairy cattle are given in Appendix-A , ? Table 3 . Appendix-A , ? Table 4 contains the requirements of growing pigs , and Table 5 those of growing lambs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are adjusted as a percentage of total ration since the ad lib. self-feeding system is com , nonly followed . The intake of a nutrient is approximately controlled to the optimum level because of the physiological limitation in feed consumption due to feed volume . Nutrient Requirements for Milk Production The raw materials for milk production have to be provided through feed . Temporarily the animal may adjust shortages by mobilising its body reserves . But , if the shortages persist , milk production will go down and the health of the animal will be impaired . Heacker in 1914 improved the accuracy of feeding standards by showing that the nutrient requirements varied not only with the quantity of milk produced but also with its quality , especially its fat content . The recommendations for milk production for dairy cattle are given in Appendix A , Table 6 . The need for each cow for milk production may be calculated depending on its milk yield and percentage of milk fat and added to the maintainance requirements . However , in // the case of primipara which may be growing and producing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added to the growth ration . Feeding for Work The animal requires nutrients and energy for doing work and they have to be included in the ration over and above maintenance requirements . Usually the feeding standards recommended for work are inclusive of maintenance requirement . Appendix-A  --  - Table 7 gives the feed requirements of working animals . Requirements for Gestation A female animal has to provide nutrients for the growth of the foetus during pregnancy . This is negligible in the early and middle stages of pregnancy so that it can be ignored . But during the last one-third term of pregnancy , additional nutrients have to be provided to the pregnant animal for the growth of the foetus . If this is not done , it will adversely affect the health of the mother and in acute cases the development of the foetus . In milch cows , an extra allowance of 0.14 kg DCP and 0.7 kg TDN over and above her other requirements of maintenance and milk production , have been recommended by Sen and Ray from the sixth month of pregnancy onwards . If , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be added to the maintenance need only . Requirements for Reproduction Males and females require specialized feeding to bring about optimum breeding results . The cow does not require any additional nutrients over and above maintenance and milk production as it is bred when it is in milk . The requirements of the breeding bull inclusive of maintenance requirements are given in Appendix-A ? Table 8 . Sows when they are dry should be fed a ration low in energy as putting , on fat will detrimentally affect fertility . One or two weeks before breeding season onwards they are flushed ' by giving extra nutrients to increase rate of ovulation and , thereby , the litter size . Similarly , the boar requires extra rations for breeding . The recommendations for the classes of swine are given in Appendix-A ? Table 9 . The recommendations for feeding , breeding sheep are given in Appendix-A ? Table 10. // COMPUTATION OF BALANCED RATIONS Having acquired knowledge regarding the nutritive value of various feeds and their metabolic significance and having known the feeding standards , one is equipped to compute balanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the recommendations contained in feeding standards into actual formulation of feed mixtures and feeding practices . It is difficult to formulate rations which follow exactly the feeding standards because we are not computing rations from individual nutrients , but from various feeds which themselves contain many different nutrients in varying proportions . It has been found that , apart from bulk and filling capacity of the feed , the energy content of the feed is also a limiting factor for appetite and feed consumption . An animal will eat more or less of a feed depending on whether the energy content of that feed is less or more . Therefore , most of the nutrients are adjusted proportionate to the metabolizable energy . If computation of a feed mixture is done on the basis of dry matter , the lowered dry matter intake when the energy content of the feed is high , will result in deficient protein intake . Therefore , it is evident that the protein in the ration should be based on the energy content of the ration . In other words we must maintain the protein-energy ratio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done by making different feed mixtures varying in protein percentage , depending on its energy concentration . The concentration of energy in a feed mixture will be determined by the requirement , the feeds available and the capacity to consume dry matter . NRC standards for dairy cattle give specific recommendations for four production categories , growth and pregnancy . There are nine categories for beef cattle and six for sheep . Swines have four groups for breeding stock and six weight categories for market hogs . Often , the same feed mixture can serve for many categories and the only difference will be that of quantity . But , when the energy requirement increases significantly and the capacity to eat is limited , changes in the concentration of nutrients in the ration become a necessity . In computing rations , the dry matter , energy ( TDN , SE , ME or NE ) digestible crude protein ( DCP ) , minerals and vitamin A are given consideration , in ruminants . In non-ruminants , in addition to these , the essential amino acids and B-vitamins are also given importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the production requirements are added to these . Requirements for growth , work and reproduction are inclusive of maintenance requi-rements . For cows in milk , the maintenance requirement is cal-culated according to the body weight of the cow . The requirement for production is calculated by finding the nutrient requirement per kg milk yield according to its fat percentage and then multiplying this value with the average daily milk yield . The requirements for production are added to maintenance requirements . If the cow is pregnant beyond six months , the allowances for pregnancy are added to this . If the cow is below three years , as often happens when it is a first calver , the values for growth are taken instead of maintenance and production requirements are added to this . In the case of poultry and swine where self-feeding is commonly practised , the nutrients are prepared on a per kg basis . The nutrient intake is roughly controlled by the capacity of the animal or bird to eat . The concept of feed computation can be better understood thro-ugh examples . A typical example is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cow weighing 400 kg and producing on an average 10 kg milk per day with 4.5 per cent fat . The feeds available are green berseem , wheat bhusa , groundnut cake , wheat bran , barley , and maize . Computation Out of a total dry matter requirement of 8-10 kg two-thirds i.e. about 6 kg may be roughage and one-third i.e. 2 kg concentrate . The dry matter from roughage may be divided equally between green fodder and dry fodder . Therefore , the roughage fed can be ; To complete requirement , the animal needs 0.17 kg DCP and // 2.32 kg TDN contained in 2.5 to 3.5 kg dry matter . Therefore , it is evident that one should feed about 3 kg of a concentrate which will supply 0.17 kg DCP and 2.32 kg TDN . That means the concentrate fed should have a DC ) ? content of 6.0 to 7.0 per cent and TDN content of 77 to 78 per cent . Barley can be an ideally suited con-centrate for this animal . The ration can thereforebe : Preparation of Concentrate Mixture Usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ content incorporating many concentrate feeds and minerals are prepared for generalized use . The DCP and TDN intakes are controlled by offering different quantity of the mixture . For example , let us prepare a concentrate mixture with 12 per cent DCP and 70 per cent TDN . The ingredients available are , barley , oats , wheat bran , groundnut cake , cottonseed cake and mineral mixture . In order to make a concentrate mixture with a DCP content of 12 per cent and TDN content of 70 per cent the ingredients are classified into two groups , i.e , those having DCP content below 12 per cent and those above twelve per cent . The proportion of constituent feed stuffs are adjusted in the first group in such a way that the TDN of the mixture is below 70 per cent . Thus , the first mixture can be // The required concentrate mixture with 12% D.C.P. is made using the Pearson square . In the case of non-ruminants like the pig , care has to be exercised , . with respect to essential amino acids , and B-vitamins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least one source of animal protein in addition to the proteins of plant origin . Besides the ration is usually self-fed and , therefore , the energy and protein content are adjusted on a per kg basis . PREPARATION OF FEEDS FOR FEEDING Apart from deciding the daily ration we have to decide the form in which the feed has to be offered to the animals . There are many ways of doing this . We may want to measure out each feed-item according to the feed computation and put it in the feeding trough . On the other extreme , we might want to have all the feeds finely ground , machine mixed and pelletal which we would feed daily ( Fig. 6.7 ) . There are all sorts of possibilities in between these extre-mes which would work out well under certain conditions . One should find out the method of feed preparation that suits his con-ditions the best , which uses the available equipment best and which is the most economical . Out of a total of 19.62 parts , mixture I should be 17.62 parts and mixture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 89.8 and 10.2 resnectivelv . So the ingredients of the concentrate mixture will he : // Does Reducing Particle Size of Feed Really Pay ? It is often thought that reducing particle size of feed by grinding , chopping , etc. , increases their feeding value by saving on energy spent in mastication and digestion . But experience has proved it wrong . When the particle size is reduced , there is less chewing , less mixing and the saliva flow is reduced . This may actually reduce the digestibility of the feed . In ruminants this will result in rumen fermentation at a lowered pH , which has its bad effects . In these animals , when good quality fodder is fed , reducing particle size will not substantially improve feed intake , but it reduces digestibility . In the case of coarse fodders , the intake is increased at the cost of lowered digestibility . Thus , the value of these procedures depends on the nature of the particular feed and the kind of animal to which it has to be fed . Economic factors should also be taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their feed . Any attempt to increase intake by augmenting the rate of passage of ingesta through reducing particle size of feed has the inherent danger of reduced digestibility . Therefore , these processes may be adopted only when palatability has to be increased by mixing with other feeds , for making coarse fodder more easy for prehension and mastication so that spillage and wastage are reduced and when the teeth of the animal are defective or deficient . Grinding Seeds and Grains Often the thick outer covering of certain seeds and grains are not digested if they are fed as whole grains . Here again the usefulness of the process vary with the species and class of livestock and the grain in question . In general , very young and old animals benefit from grinding . For cattle all grains may be ground . Horses also need grinding except in case of oats and maize . Sheep and goats chew very efficiently and do not require any grinding . Pigs do not need any grinding except at infant stage and old age . The fineness of grinding in relation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grinding increases cost of grinding and reduces feed digestibility whereas simple cracking resulted in reduced cost of operation but with lowered utilization . Medium grinding and rolling or crushing have been found to be economical and profitable procedure . Pelleting and Waferization Among the newer methods of feed preparation are pelleting and waferization . Making hay into pellets or wafers saves storage space // and makes self-feeding and complete feeding systems simpler . Mixed rations , hay or concentrates may be made into pellets . This will reduce freight cost , storage space , and wastage in feeding . It will increase feed intake and increase gain in most cases . It has been found to increase feed efficiency . The sorting out of less palatable feeds will be prevented . It will reduce dust . It has also the advantage of less labour requirement and with pellets it is easy to feed mechanically . These advantages , however , may be offset by disadvantages , such as : cost of grinding and pelleting ; reduced rumination , sometimes leading to digestive disturbances or tympanitis and reducing labour requirements on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advisable due to socio-economic reasons in an underdeveloped country . Pelleted feeds are ideally suited for supplementing range animals on pasture as wastage from wind and weather is reduced . Chopping Green Fodder and Hay The usefulness of chopping is again determined by the nature of the feed and the type and class of animal to which it has to be fed ( Fig. 6.8 ) . As a rule , there is no need of chaffing fine stemmed green fodder . Only in the case of thick stemmed green fodder like jowar and maize , chaffing will be advantageous . If they are not chaffed the animal is likely to leave back the thick stems . For cattle , sheep and horses very little can be gained by chopping or grinding hay . But if long hay is not fed in proper mangers that prevent undue waste , considerable savings can be made by chopping it . The savings is more in the case of coarse and stemmy hay . Grinding hay not only increases the cost but also makes it dusty and less palatable to stock and reduces its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feed except in certain special cases . The digestibility or feeding value were not increased and often there was loss of nutrients due to this . However , cooking has been found to be useful in the case of potatoes , field beans and soya beans . Soaking Feed When facilities for grinding or cracking grains with hard outer covering are not available , it is a useful practice to soak them overnight in water before feeding . Care should be taken that such soaked feed does not become stale due to keeping it longer after soaking . // Slop feeding of pigs is adopted by many small scale farmers . But , it has no advantage over feeding dry mash and in large scale operations increases the cost of feeding operations . Fermenting , Sprouting or Malting Feeds These processes in general do not add to the nutritive value of a feed and at times there may be losses . In this country , sprouted gram is fed to cows as a cure for sterility and to induce heat in cows which do not have regular heat or those which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not beneficial . HAY Green fodder will be in excess of need during certain seasons and scarce in certain others . This is unavoidable however much carefully the cropping scheme has been prepared . Under such a situation preservation of green fodder during the lush season is a must for tiding over the difficult periods . This can be as hay or as silage . Preparation of hay by sun curing depends on the type of crop available and the climatic conditions . Thick stemmed crops like Maize and jowar are not suitable for hay making as it will take longer time for the stems to dry . Thin stemmed crops like lucerne , oats and grasses are suited for hay making . As the adage make hay when the sun shines ' goes , hay has to be made when the atmosphere is not overcast . Monsoon season , is not suitable for hay making as it will be raining havily and is always cloudy ( see Fig.6.9 ) . What is Hay ? The object in haymaking is to reduce moisture in green fodders to a sufficient degree so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or spoilage due to mold growth . In that process the endeavour should be to preserve the maximum amount of nutrients possible . The stage of maturity of the crop at the time of cutting is very important as far as nutritive value of the hay is concerned . An early cut means more nutritive value but less yield . Late cuttings on the other hand will result in less nutritive value but more bulk . A compromise , therefore , has to be struck . A stage when the gain due to increased bulk no longer could counterbalance the loss in nutritive value , is soon reached . In most of the cases this is the early flowering stage . The plants should be cut at ( his stage for the preparation of hay . // Properties of Good Hay ( 1 ) The fodder cut at the Proper stage will have the maximum nutrients and , therefore will make better hay . Delay in harvesting fodder for hay making will make the stems woody and lignified with the resultant deterioration in the nutritive value . Besides , a part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formation . Thus , crop cut at the proper stage can make good quality hay . ( 2 ) Good hay will be having a major proportion of the leaves preserved . The leaves are richer in nutrients compared to other parts . Shattering of leaves during the process of hay making will , therefore , reduce the quality of hay . ( 3 ) Green colour of hay is an indication of its quality . It means that a greater proportion of the leaves have been preserved and losses due to bleaching , leaching , fermentation , etc. have been minimised. ( 4 ) It will be made out of thin stemmed crops so that it is soft and palatable . ( 5 ) The crop used for hay making should be free from weeds and poisonous plants to get good hay . ( 6 ) Hay should not have more than 20-23 per cent moisture when stored . If there is more moisture , fermentation will take place , generating a great deal of heat . Ultimately it may lead to spontaneous combustion . Even if it does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affected . ( 7 ) Good hay will be free from dust and mold . ( 8 ) It will have a pleasant aroma which adds to its palatability . Different Types of Hay Depending on the crop from which hay is made , they may be classified as legume hay , non-legume hay and mixed hay . Legume hay are made out of leguminous plants like lucerne and other clovers . They are generally rich in proteins , vitamins and minerals as compared to non-leguminous ones . This hay is usually fed to young calves in calf-starter rations . The non- leguminous hay contains less proteins , minerals and vitamins . This type of hay may be from crops or from grasses . Those made from green crops like barley or oats are usually rich in carbohydrates . Mixed hay is made from a mixed crop of leguminous and non-leguminous plants . Such a crop is generally cut early as they do not come to the flowering stage simultaneously . The nutritive value of such hay will depend on the proportion of leguminous and non-leguminous plants . // How to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps in all the methods of haymaking : ( 1 ) Selection of suitable plant varieties and its cultivation on good soil with proper care in the form of watering , fertilization , etc . The seed-rate should be high to ensure dense stand of the crop which will result in finer stems , heavier yield and less weeds . ( 2 ) Cutting the fodder at the proper stage of maturity . For lucerne in the first cut , it is the early bloom stage and in the second and subsequent it is when one-tenth to one-fourth of the crops are in bloom or when new shoots begin to develop from the crown . For grasses it is when they begin to head out , for grain crops when grain is in the milk stage and for cow-pea when pods are half to fully matured . ( 3 ) Curing of the hay . In curing hay the objectives are to ( i ) preserve maximum nutrients , and ( ii ) to remove moisture sufficiently to avoid moldiness and spoilage . During curing , shattering losses should be minimised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care may be taken to avoid it . Leaves constitute roughly 50 per cent by weight but contain more than 70 per cent of the protein and 90 per cent of carotene . Bleaching and . fermentation losses . Even under ideal conditions there is loss of nutrients during curing . But , when the temperature is too high or when moisture content has not been kept low enough , severe losses due to bleaching and fermentation take place . The green colour of the hay is more or less proportional to the carotene content . Losses in nutrients due to leaching from rain is the major loss when one tries to make hay during monsoon season . The leaching losses are negligible if the rain falls just after cutting of the crop . Losses increase with the advancement of curing if leaching takes place . ( 4 ) Moisture content of hay . From freshly cut crop with a moisture content of 70 to 80 per cent , hay with the following moisture content has to be prepared . For loose hay ? 25-28 per cent water For baled hay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent water In order to judge whether hay is properly cured , two thumb rule methods are available . ( i ) The scrape method . With the nail try to scrape the epidermis from the stem of the plant . If the epidermis can be peeled from // the stem , it is not sufficiently cured . ( ii ) The twist method . A small amount of the hay is twisted in the hands . If the stem breaks a little and no ' plant juice ' comes out from the twisted stems , the hay can be assumed to have been cured well . ( 5 ) Storing properly . Enough care may be taken while storing hay to protect it from rain and sunlight . There are four popular methods of haymaking . They are field curing , mow curing , artificial drying and pelleting. 1 . Field Curing As the name indicates , cut plants are cured in the field itself to make hay . The various steps in this process are : ( i ) Cutting the crops . Any type of mower , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desirable to mow in the same direction . The crop is left there itself in the swath to dry partially . Time of cutting and the presence of dew have only slight effect on the quality of hay . ( ii ) Swath curing . Hay is dried much more rapidly in the swath than windrow . Therefore maximum advantage of swath curing may be taken to speed up the operations . But after a certain degree of curing there will be shattering and bleaching of leaves reducing the nutritive value of hay considerably . The forage should be left to cure in the swath until it is wilted sufficiently but before there is danger of shattering and loss of carotene due to bleaching action of sun . No definite time can be assigned for swath curing as it is dependant on climatic variables and the nature and density of the crop . Roughly the moisture at this time will be 40 per cent . ( iii ) Raking . After wilting forage to about 40 per cent moisture in the swath it is rolled into small loose fluffy cylindrical bundles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side delivery rake or with hand . It is better to do raking in the morning as dew makes the hay a little more tough and prevent shattering . ( vi ) Cocking . This is the process of making windrows into bigger heaps after hay had been cured partially in the windrows . Cocks are even protected with hay caps where rain and storm are expected . Due to labour shortage this step is discarded in many advanced countries . Hay is completely cured in the windrow . But in countries like India where labour is cheap cocking is advisable as it will give better hay with more carotene content . ( v ) Baling and storing . Pick-up baling directly from windrow is the most automated system where the baler attached to a tractor // picks up hay in the form of windrows and bales it . Stationary balers are also available where hay has to be carried to the baler . Where such machines are not available hay may be stored as loose bundles . 2 . Mow Curing ( Barn Drying ) Mow curing refers to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mows . Heated or unheated air is blown on to the mows until the moisture is reduced to 20-25 per cent . Swath curing is completed ' in the field itself and when the moisture is 35-40 per cent it is taken in the barns and placed on the mows . It takes seven to fourteen days on the mows with unheated air to cure the hay fully . With heated air it takes less time . Generally the hay produced in this manner will be greener and leafier and of a higher quality than field cured hay . 3 . Dehydration or Artificial Drying This is the process of chopping freshly cut or wilted fodder and drying it in artificial driers . For the large part , this is limited to large commercial operations where alfa an meal or alfa alfa leaf meal for use chiefly as a vitamin supplement for poultry and swine are produced . Such hay is consistently of superior quality . 4 . Pelleting The hay is made into pellets by a pelleting machine . This has the advantages of : ( a ) simplifying haymaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one-third to one-fifth ( c ) increasing the density and , therefore , the dry matter consumption of the animals ( d ) reducing labour ( e ) decreasing nutrient losses ( f ) making automatic feeding of hay possible , and ( g ) eliminating dust . But this requires costly equipments and , therefore , the small farmer can not afford it . Brown hay . Due to inclement weather , hay wilted to 50 per cent water content , will have to be stacked some times . Such forage will ferment and reduction in nutritive value will take place due to the excessive heat generated . The hay will turn brown in colour and hence the name . Such hay is not recommended due to poor nutritive value and fear of spontaneous combustion . It should be made only when there is no other alternative . // SILAGE Another important method of conserving green fodder is by converting it into silage . Silage can be called the fermented product of green forages where the acids produced by anaerobic fermentation of the sugars present in these forages preserve them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not in common use before 1900 , at present it has been widely accepted in all the major dairying countries . This widespread use is due to the following advantages : Advantages ( 1 ) It is less at risk from the weather than hay making . ( 2 ) The ensiling process is the only means by which the entire forage plant can be preserved in a succulent form . The crop can be harvested and stored at the time of its development when it has the maximum nutritive value . ( 3 ) Retains higher proportions of nutrients than hay because losses due to shattering and bleaching are minimized . Silage preserves 85 per cent of feed energy . Flay under best conditions preserve only 80 per cent and under poor conditions 50-60 per cent . ( 4 ) Silage crops have more yield than other hay-crops . Earlier cuttings at higher levels of digestibility is possible and regrowths are quicker . Thus , more feed nutrients can be grown on an acre of crops used for silage than an acre used for most other purposes . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheaply , more quickly and with less labour . ( 6 ) Mechanization from field cutting to feeding is easier with silage . ( 7 ) It requires less storage space than hay . ( 8 ) Fear of fire is avoided . ( 9 ) Practically any forage crop is fit for ensiling . Weedy crcps and crops with thick stalks can be ensiled equally well . ( 10 ) Many by-products can be economically used . ( 11 ) Where conservation is incidental to or integrated with grazing , silage making is more dependable as a method of cleaning up soiled swards and ensuring aftermath grazing . ( 12 ) Converting crop into silage clears the land earlier . ( 13 ) It is palatable and slightly laxative . ( 14 ) It is a better source of protein and carotene than hay . ( 15 ) There is a wider choice of feeding methods for silage . ( 16 ) Ensiling ensures better storage for a long time . // Disadvantages ( 1 ) Requires silo and special equipments. ( 2 ) Less amount of vitamin D in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved for preservatives. ( 4 ) Due to moisture content , tonnage and transporting charges are increased . ( 5 ) Wet silage can present difficult problems of disposal of effluent . ( 6 ) Smell from poorly fermented silage can create problems . ( 7 ) Wastage may be high when only small amounts are made at one time . The Ensilage Process It is not necessary to be a biochemist to make good silage , but some understanding of the ensilage process is certainly helpful in developing a silage system on the farm . In the ensiling process , the chopped plants are compactly packed inside the silo and sealed off from the outer atmosphere . The plants continue to respire and use up all the oxygen present in the trapped air , giving off carbon dioxide . This checks mold growth . Under these anaerobic conditions , bacteria , especially lactobacilli will ferment sugars present in the fodder crops to lactic acid and certain other acids . The acids produced dissolve in the plant juices . It is the concentration of the acid solution , rather than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for , the wetter the crop , the greater is the concentration of acid needed for stable preservation , i.e. , the lower must be the pH of the silage . The crops contain bacteria other than lactobacilli like the clostridium species . Clostridia can utilize sugars and lactic acid and produce butyric acid . They can also break down proteins . This is a process of rotting and decomposition and produces a vile-smelling unpalatable silage . The activity of clostridia is kept under check by acidity but is encouraged by moisture . Thus , excess of moisture will result in poor quality silage . Successful Ensilage Good silage should have a mild , pleasant aroma , an acid taste and a slightly greenish colour . It should be free from sliminess and mold growth and should have sufficient acid to prevent further degradation . Successful ensilage can be achieved by following the steps listed below : ( i ) The crop should contain an adequate level of sugars for acid // fermentation : Ensile forage species having naturally high sugar content , like forage maize , sorghum and meadow fescue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they have low sugar and high protein content which favour the growth of clostridia . Do not cut immature crops for silage making as they have high protein and low sugar contents . Crops for silage may be cut late in the day as sugar content increases during the hours of sunlight . When a crop is known to be deficient in sugar , add molasses as uniformly as possible before ensiling . The crop should not have a high moisture content : Avoid cutting immature crops with high moisture content , although de-laying too much will reduce the digestibility of the crop . Avoid cut-ting crops when soaked in rain or dew . If necessary , wilt the crop in the field before transporting to the silo . Consolidate and rapidly seal the silo as the oxidation of sugars can produce water . Also seepage of rain water inside the silos should be prevented . Exclude air from silage : When the crop is filled inside the silo , air is trapped in the meshes of the forage . Oxidation of sugars takes place with generation of heat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currents which draw in fresh air . Rapid filling , con-solidation with a tractor , chopping or lacerating , evacuation pump for further compression of the fodder , etc. are helpful . By corn-bining consolidation with quick and perfect sealing the air-free condition needed by lactobacilli is quickly established while at the same time the maximum amount of sugar remains to be fer-mented . Seal the silo as soon as filling is finished : This seal will have several functions . While the silage is warm it prevents the warm air from escaping and setting in currents bringing fresh air . It also prevents entry of fresh air when the fermentation has been finished and thereby keeps the silage stable . In un-roofed silos , this prevents the entry of rain water and diluting the acid which will cause rot-ting of silage . Wilting is perhaps the most controversial aspect of silage making . Excellent silage can be made from crops with high mois-ture per cent provided enough sugars are available for producing enough acidity . But immature crops with high moisture content are always low in sugar content also . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level of 25-30 per cent dry matter . If an additive is added , less wilting will suffice . An advantage claimed for wilting is that it will increase the dry matter consumption of animals espe-cially when animals are fed mostly silage . // ( iii ) Additives : Silage making is a chemical process and , there-fore , many ways of chemically preserving silage by adding certain substances have been successful . Several broad classes of additives have been tried : Those which supply additional readily fermentable carbohy-drates to produce preserving acids. eg. , molasses , sugar . Mineral acids ( mixed hydrochloric and sulphuric acids ) which give a stable , very low pH silage , and Organic acids ? especially lactic and formic acids ? which help in achieving a stable pH more rapidly . Alternatively , a cul-ture of lactobacilli can be used . Additives are not needed in making silage from crops wilted above 30 per cent dry matter or with high sugar-crops wilted above 25 per cent dry matter . They are necessary with problem ' crops like those with high moisture , high nitrogen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not enough that an additive reduces silage losses ? it must also give an acceptable feed . ( rii ) Expose the minimum surface when silage is being fed out : When a silo is opened , air enters and mold growth will set in all over the silage face . This is negligible if silage is removed fast enough ( say 15 cm per day ) . But wastage can occur if the race is exposed for a long time as it happens when silage is self-fed by too few number of cows . Thus , the size of the silage face may be planned for the number of stock to be fed . Crops used for Ensiling Almost all forage crops are suitable for silage making . Even some crops that are unsuitable as green fodder or hay due to bitterness or off flavour are suitable as silage as they appear to lose these qualities during ensiling . Maize is a popular crop for silage . It yields highly . Besides , at the stage of cutting for ensiling , it possesses the required dry matter per-centage and available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addition of any preservatives . Sorghum is another im-portant silage crop . The sweet sorghum is better for silage than the grain sorghum . It should be cut in the dough stage . Grasses and legumes when used for silage , are usually referred to as hair-crop silages . Ensiling them requires special methods due to the following facts : ( a ) They may not contain sufficient sugar to produce enough acidity to stop further bacterial degradation . // The legumes contain more protein and when acted upon by bacteria may produce ammonia which in turn will neutralize some acidity thereby allowing the decomposition to'continue . These forages are often high in moisture content . When berseem is used , its stem is hollow and thereby result in incorporating more air which will be difficult to remove . Special methods consist of : Lowering the moisture content by wilting . Adding mineral acids . Adding readily fermentable carbohydrates from which acid can be made . Making mixed silages with crops like sorghum or corn . Lacerating crops like berseem . It will be difficult to list all the crops that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are ; all grasses , lucerne , cow peas , oats , barley , red clover , ladino clover , etc . Types of Silos A very large number of different types of silos are in existence . These vary from massive concrete structures with complete equip-ment , to simple plastic bags . Other types include conventional tower silos , trench silos , pit silos , tube silos , clamp silos , wire and plastic silos and bunker silos . Tower silos are cylindrical concrete structures about 8-10 meters in diameter and 15 metres in height . Fresh forage is blown in at the top and when ready for use the silage is removed through a series of openings at one side . Trench silos as the name implies is a shallow horizontal pit . Its advantage is that it is very readily accessible thereby reducing labour costs . A low water table and clay soil are desirable in the location of trench silos . Often the trench can be dug into the side of a hill to increase accessibility . Pit silos , as the name implies , are pits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labour . Tub silos are upright silos of a very wide diameter . These tub silos are fairly easy to unload by hand . Bunker silos are suitably made in areas where soil is loose and caving in is feared , and where water table is high ( see Fig. 6.10 B ) . They are above ground structures composed of walls between which ensilage is compressed . The walls may be of wood , or concrete . Forage is put in and taken out of bunker and trench silos in much the same way . Trucks or tractor trolleys loaded with chaffed fodder // can be driven in , unloaded and driven through . Forage is then packed with tractors equipped with blades . Clamp silos can be used where soil is suitable and the water table is high . A shallow trench is dug and the soil is piled on either side to increase the height of the walls . Pack ensilage as high as possible and as compactly as possible . A good plastic seal is installed on top . Plastic sheets are used in different ways to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with plastic film and welded wire fencing . Silage hags are made of smaller tubes of plastic . They are small silos of 50 kg or even less . Tints , for small livestock operations inexpensive silage structures are available . The ends of each tube is double tied making a bag with a handle at each end . FEEDING CATTLE AND BUFFALOES There is much similarity in the feeding nature and requirements of the two species . Both are ruminants and therefore , utilize large amounts of roughages in their ration . Besides , many of the amino acids and B-vitamins are synthesized in the rumen making them non-essential in the ration of these animals . In spite of these similarities , it will be erroneous to assume that the nutrient requirements and feeding habits of cattle and buffaloes are the same . Buffaloes can utilize coarser feeds and their dry matter requirement is slightly high . At present information on the feed requirements of buffaloes is scanty and invariably feeding standards of cattle are applied blindly to buffaloes also . This suitation needs improvement . Feeding Minch Cows However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of no use unless they are fed and managed to achieve maximum economical production . A cow with good genotype represents a factory capable of producing large quantities of milk and butter-fat provided the inputs in the form of feeds are available in adequate quantity . It has been discussed earlier that a dairy cow needs feed for maintenance , for development of foetus and for milk production . Besides , in the first lactation , a cow may be growing and producing simultaneously so that allowances for growth has also to be incorporated over and above other requirements . Therefore , the first step in feeding a cow is to calculate the total requirements as per any of the common feeding standards . In this country , during the past // 10-15 years the price of cereal grains , oil cakes and other byproducts have risen very fast , so that , today an average concentrate mixture is a much more expensive source of feed nutrients than good green fodder crops . Research and experience in the country prove that feed costs for milking stock can be substantially reduced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observed that if ad libituna supply of good quality leguminous fodder is available , no extra concentrates are necessary up to 10 kg milk production in cows and 7 kg in buffaloes . Above that , the cows may be fed 1 kg concentrate mixture for every 2.5 kg milk produced . Buffaloes require 1 kg concentrate for every 2.0 kg milk . But this is only a thumb rule . Actual feeding may be done on the basis of the requirements calculated as per feeding standards . All feeding schedules are meant for the average animals . Individuals may need more or less concentrates than given in the feeding standards . One must carefully watch the animal and increase or reduce the ration depending on whether the animal is becoming lean or fat . Under loose housing system and self-feeding practices , it is not possible to feed roughage to animals , individually . Group feeding of roughage combined with individual feeding of concentrates at the time of milking is a generally accepted practice . Cropping Scheme and Feeding Schedule Feeding schedule is tied up with the production of crops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question : " What crops shall I grow , how much and when ? " If one guesses badly and runs short , he either has to underfeed or he may have to pay premium prices on the market . The feeding plan should be flexible , simple and workable . Any far sighted dairyman will have at least one-third of the annual requirement of the fodders stored either as silage or hay so that his feeding plans are not adversely affected by crop failures . Time to Cut Forages Forages are more valuable when they are reasonably young . On further maturing they become woody and lignified with , consequent reduction in the digestibility of nutrients . On the other hand harvesting the crops too early will reduce the yield and make the crop succulent . Therefore a via media has to be struck . Usually at the flowering stage there is maximum yield of digestible nutrients and , the forages should be harvested at this stage . // Feeding High Producers The major problem while computing rations of high yielders , is that with bulky feeds it is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the limit of its dry matter intake capa-city . The physical limitation of volume-intake prevents full use of the rumen . The space in the rumen is limited and once filled , it can-not be reused unless the previous material passes into the lower digestive tract . Answers to " how to maintain an optimum fermentation in the rumen ? " and " what a farmer can do in the feeding manger to accomplish this ? " , will give solution to feeding of high producers . Farmers can control rumen fermentation by : ( a ) Composition o the ration , ( b ) Ratio of ingredients in the ration , ( c ) Quantity of feed supplied , ( d ) Frequency of feeding and ( e ) Physical form of the feeds Composition and Ratio of Ingredients in the Ration To ensure adequate intake of food energy , a mixture of fodde and grains is offered . The grains have the tendency to change the microbiological and chemical atmospheres in the rumen . With a greater proportion of grain , the dry matter intake and digestibility increase but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect of adding grain to forage has got an optimum point and any further increase in the proportion of grains will only bring down the efficiency . Ration Density x Digestibility Intake is influenced by digestibility as well as density of the ration . A measure obtained from the multiplication of the two ha sufficient relevance in the feeding of high yielders . It has been obser ved that maintaining a density x digestibility value of 35 is desirable for proper rumen fermentation . In practice , one may combine feed stuffs having a value above 35 with those having a value below 35 to strike at an optimum ration and to maintain the value at thirty five Table 2 gives density x digestibility values of some cattle feeds . An example indicating the combination of various feeds to arriv at a value of 35 for the total ration is given below : Quality of Forage Many people have a misconceived idea that the deficiencies of a poor quality fodder can be made good by feeding more concentrates . Actual experience , however does not contribute to this contention . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of intakes can not be over-emphasized . At any level of grain feeding , an animal fed high quality fodder will yield better than one fed low quality one . By increasing the amount of concentrates , the damage caused by feeding poor quality forage can not be retrieved on one hand , and increase in cost of milk production can not be prevented on the other . ( i ) Role of Crude Fibre in the Ruminant Ration . Crude fibre is very important in the ration of milking cows because the cows need acetic acid for maintaining normal milk fat percentage as well as total milk production . It is well known that the acetic acid production in the rumen is dependant on the percentage of cellulose in the ration . Acetic and other volatile acids originate from the fermentation of cellulose and other constituents in the feed . A certain percentage of crude fibre in the ruminant ration is a must . Higher percentage of grains in the ration reduces cellulose digestibility and causes disturbances like depressed milk fat , depressed milk production and in extreme cases damage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The quality of cellulose in the ration also has its influence in this situation . // ( ii ) Importance of Rumen Protozoa . Rumen Protozoa are highly sensitive to rumen pH . In high levels of feeding , protozoa exert a moderating influence . The protozoa take away a large quantity of starch granules out of circulation from the rumen fluid , when large amount of grains are fed , thereby denying an explosive growth of starch splitting bacteria which would otherwise cause a huge acid production resulting in dangerous low levels of pH . Later on , these starch granules are available to the ruminants at a slower rate as and when the protozoa die and get digested in the lower alimentary canal . A large quantity of grains fed in a single doze , will overwhelm the protozoons and the consequent low pH will completely annihilate them . Further lowering of pH can have bad consequences . This necessitates the dividing of the ration into different parts and feeding at frequent intervals . Frequency of Feeding In ordinary course of fermentation there are five distinct phases viz. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phase and inactive phase . Out of these , the exponential phase is very important as maximum damage to production or health of the animal occurs during this phase . The fermentation curve resulting from a single feeding is similar to the one in a fermentation vat for alcohol production by batch method . If ratio of grains to crude fibre is wide in a heavy ration , the rumen pH may drop to very low levels during the acceleration phase , adversely affecting the milk production and milk fat percentage . Accelaration phase is followed by exponential phase the duration of which is dependant upon grain ration . At a low level of feeding for low producers this phase is short-lived and is not of any serious consequence . But at higher level of feeding necessitated by higher production , a higher proportion of soluble and easily digestible carbohydrates like starch may result in serious consequences . One way to overcome the detrimental effect of high level of feed ing ( both concentrates and roughage ) is to feed parts of the same ration at frequent intervals . By feeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are reduced , while with four times a day , they are almost eliminated . Under such a feeding schedule the rumen pH is not considerably lowered . This results in greater digestibility and better utilization of protein . Saliva flow and frequency of feeding . The sodium and Potassium salts entering rumen through saliva are primarily responsible for buffering activity in the rumen . A high concentrate ration compared // to a high roughage one induces lesser saliva flow and consequently contributes towards lowering of pH in the rumen . But when the high concentrate ration is fed at different intervals , the mineral con-tent in the rumen returns to normal level . Mixing grains with roughages . It is a common practice to feed grains at the time of milking , particularly in case of weaned ani-mals . Roughage is offered either before or after milking . It is natu-ral that when a large quantity of concentrate is fed at milking time , the appetite of the cows will be reduced for sometime and they are not likely to eat forage immediately . Consequently , there will be four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of forages . The feeding of concentrates separately from roughage during a four-time feeding schedule reduces acetic acid production and incre-ases propionic acid . When grain alone was fed as one of the four feedings , it further aggravated the condition . It has been observed that feeding grains on top of silage increased the fat percentage and milk production . The preceding discussion is aimed at impr-essing upon the reader that the conventional way of feeding grains separately at the time of milking is not conducive for optimum fermentation in the rumen of high producers . Concentrates have to be fed either mixed with roughages like silage or after the animals have consumed a certain amount of forages . However , for inducing let down of milk , if necessary , a small amount of grains may be fed at the time of milking . Grinding , chaffing , pelleting , etc . Yet another attempt to combat the problem of low intake was to increase the rate of passage of ingesta by treating the food materials by grinding , chaffing , pelleting , etc . But when the particle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less flow of saliva and all these result in a rumen fermentation at a lowered pH , which has bad effect . There is also a significant reduc-tion in digestibility . When high quality fodder is fed , reducing particle size may not increase intake , but it reduces digestibility . In the case of coarse fodders it increases the intake , but a price has to be paid in terms of reduced digestibility . Thus , it is evident that the ruminant is well equipped for decimating fodder by itself by rumi-nation and that any attempt to increase intake by augmenting rate of passage of ingesta through a process of reducing particle size of ingesta will only result in reduced digestibility . Chaffing may be done only with a view to reduce wastage in the case of very coarse fod-de rs. ( ii ) The level of feeding also influences rumen function . Feeding // at a higher rate , lowers the mean time spent by food material in the digestive tract , with decreased digestibility . The digestibility is further lowered if fodders are chaffed to smaller particles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the one hand to increase intake of nutrients by high yielders to support high levels of production , where as on the other hand , intake of larger mass of food or processing aimed at increasing intake , seriously affects rumen function and digestibility . The reduction of particle size and increasing rate of intake can not be recommended as measures for meeting the nutritive requirements of high yielders . Guidelines to Feed High Yielders ( 1 ) include optimum proportion of forage and concentrates in the ration . Good results are obtained by feeding a ration that derive 30-40 per cent of the feed units from grains and 60-70 per cent from forages. ( 2 ) The forage should be of excellent quality cut at the optimum stage . A short delay to cut the fodder can adversely affect its quality . The inferior quality of the fodder can not be made good completely by either increasing its quantity or by increasing the amount of concentrates . ( 3 ) For high yielders , the density x digestibility value of the total feed be kept around 35. ( 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintain a continuous fermentation in the rumen . The cows should be fed a minimum of four times a day at six hours intervals . Each feeding should comprise of both grain and forage . But if animals are to be fed for low levels of production , there is very little to be gained by frequent feeding . ( 5 ) When high levels of grains are fed , feeding it mixed with the roughage or feeding it after the animal has consumed a certain amount of forage will assure the maximum feed utilization . ( 6 ) Processing and reducing particle size of fodder may not be done unless they serve a specific purpose . Feeding Breeding Bull Breeding bull should be fed good quality roughage and sufficient concentrates to keep them thrifty , but not fat . When the bull is receiving a liberal supply of good quality forage , it needs an additional 2-3 kg of 13-15 per cent protein concentrate mixture . Feeding excess of silage or hay is undesirable as it will make the bull paunchy and less efficient in mating . Nutrient supply in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intensity of service . For bulls used in artificial insemination where maximum number of ejaculations are received , the schedule given in Appendix A Table 8 may be followed . Feeding Young Stock When a calf is born its rumen will not be developed and it will take a few months until rumen is fully developed and start functioning . Until then the calf is similar to a simple-stomached animal nutritionally . It implies the following : ( i ) Essential amino acids should be provided in required quantity in the ration of calves . In other words they will benefit from high quality protein and from a mixed source of protein . ( ii ) Vitamins belonging to the B-complex group are a nutritional necessity for them apart from vitamin A and D. ( iii ) They can not utilize non-protein nitrogenous substances like urea. ( iv ) They require more minerals for growth of bone , muscle and other tissues . Importance of Colostrum Feeding In cattle the antibodies ( gama globulins ) are transferred from mother to the calf through colostrum . These gama globulins will be absorbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forming a ready made antibody resistance system for the calf against all the disease producing agents and other antigens the mother has had encountered during its lifetime . This will protect the calf against diseases in the early stages , until their own antibody manufacturing ' system takes over . Thus , if colostrum is not fed , the calves are denied antibody cover and , therefore , will remain susceptible to many diseases . Most likely , they will perish due to some disease or the other . Besides , colostrum is highly nutritious . It is slightly laxative and prevents constipation . This is helpful because the diet of the young calf being totally devoid of crude fibre is constipatory . Feeding the antibiotics . Antibiotic feed supplements like Aureomycin , Terramycin , Penicillin and different combinations of these antibiotics when supplemented in feed result in : ( 1 ) Improved appetite ( 2 ) Increased growth ( from 10-30 per cent ) ( 3 ) Smoother hair coat ( 4 ) Reduction in incidence of calf scours // For example feeding Aureomycin at a rate of 80 mg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an increase of 10-30 per cent in their growth rate . It has been observed that the antibiotic feed supplementation is more effective in less hygienic environments . Feeding the young calf . The calf that is worth raising deserves raising well . The feeding and management during the early stages of life greatly influence the future production when it grows into a mature cow . The new born calf should get colostrum for three to five days . If the calf is weak to drink milk on its own , it may be helped to do so by holding it up to its mother 's udder or by pouring the milk into its mouth . When weaning is practised in zebu breeds where maternal instinct is well developed , it is better not to allow the calf to suckle at all . Even the colostrum may be milked out and fed to the calf from a pail or from a nippled can ( see Fig. 6.11 ) . Teaching a calf to drink from the pail . Withhold feed to the calf for two to four hours and let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milk and let the calf to suckle from it . Slowly lower your fingers to the pail containing milk pushing the calf 's head if necessary . By repeating the process the calf will learn to drink from the pail . The pail should be very clean . Milk given should be heated to body temperature . Nipple Feeding . In Western countries , milk utensils fitted with rubber nipples are used to feed milk to weaned calves . Milk at body temperature is poured into the vessel which is kept at the level suitable for the calf to suckle . Strict hygienic measures in washing and sterilizing the nipples and vessels are necessary to avoid calf scours . Avoid overfeeding . Overfeeding young calves causes calf scours . It is better to keep the calf on the hungry side than overfeed it . Similarly , milk with a high fat percentage also causes scours . Milk from a cow with low fat percentage can be fed or the milk with high fat percentage may be diluted with hot water and fed . The calf should he fed according to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 12 kg body weight per day . The calf 's appetite and condition may also be taken into account . Rate of growth and age are other important factors . Schedule of feeding calves . The calf is first fed colostrum for 2 to 4 days and then whole milk for a period of 10 to 14 days . After this the whole milk may be substituted with skimmed milk , partially in the beginning and completely after two months . Skimmed milk is // rich in protein but comparatively low in energy . Therefore , when skimmed milk feeding is introduced , an energy-rich concentrate mixture may be given . Besides these , the calves may be started on good legume hay or early cut green fodder from second week on-wards . This will stimulate rumen development and establishment of proper rumen micro-organisms and will enable the calf to adapt to cheaper roughage feeding at an early stage . These roughages may be fed ad libitum , increasing the quantity offered as these animals gradually adapt to such type of feeding . The feeding schedule for crossbred calves is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an adult bullock has two components , viz. ( i ) the maintenance requirement , and ( ii ) the requirement for mecha nical work . The maintenance requirement of the bullock is similar to that of the cow and is a function of the body weight . In doing work , a portion of the nutrient energy is used up in muscular con-tractions and the remaining is wasted as heat . The nutrient require ment for work production is , therefore , dependant on the body weight , type of work and duration . The work may be light or heavy depending on the purpose to which the bullock is utilized . There has been little information available on the exact energy and pro tein needs for working bullocks . However , work done by Kellner indicates that muscles are not broken down in work if enough energy is available . Similarly the requirements of vitamins and minerals are also not increased significantly for work . Based on these assumptions and also on the accurate standards available for // horses , Sen and Ray formulated the nutrient requirements for working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standards are inclusive of maintenance need . For light work the requirements can be met through roughages . But for heavy work , supplementation with energy-rich concentrates is a must . Management of Grazing The main objectives of ideal grazing management should be : ( i ) to maintain the pasture in the highest state of herbage produ-ction , ( ii ) to provide the maximum amount of nutrients to the grazing animal and ( iii ) to maintain soil fertility . Over-grazing of a continuous nature is the greatest single factor which causes deterioration of grasslands . A smaller number of wellfed animals is always better than a large number of half-starved ones both for the animals as well as the pasture . Therefore , systems of grazing have to be evolved that will restrict the number of animals let in for grazing at a time . In deciding the number of animals given access to the pasture , the carrying capacity of the grassland should be taken into account which is expressed in terms of area of grassland needed per animal in an average season . Allowing grazing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early grazing . Even when the number of animals allowed grazing is small , if grazing is of a continuous nature the effect is a cumulative one . Grazing animals have their preferences for certain more palatable grasses . On account of this selective grazing habit , more palatable species tend to get depleted if continuous grazing is allowed . To avoid this , grazing has to be deferred ' or in other words it has to be discontinuous . As the animals daily need feeding , this can be achieved only by a rotational grazing system in which when part of the grassland is subjected to grazing the other part or parts are given rest to recoup . The various grazing systems are described below : ( 1 ) Controlled continuous grazing . The number of livestock allowed for grazing is limited depending on the carrying capacity . Grazing is continuous , but altogether stopped when the certain preferred species of grasses reach a minimum . This is better than the uncontrolled grazing going on in Indian pasture lands . ( 2 ) Deferred grazing . This system is applicable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formation and seed maturity in part of the pasture by delaying grazing there . This // gives chance for the perennial grass to make good growth and accumulate sufficient nutrients in reserve to maintain its vigour and produce new shoots from the shed seeds , next year . The grassland is divided into three compartments . One compartment is earmarked for seeding and the other two are subjected to grazing alternately . Grazing is allowed in the seeded ' compartment at an appropriate stage when the seeds are mature and the plants are not too old and unpalatable . Grazing at this stage helps in broadcasting of seeds also . Grazing in the other two compartments ensures tender forage while alternating the plots gives a chance for the grasses to recoup . One plot out the of the three is left for seeding yearly in rotation so that in a period of three years each segment gets a period of recuperation and rest . ( 3 ) Rotational grazing . The whole pasture is fenced into a convenient number of sub-units . They are subjected to grazing in rotation at suitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shifting from plot to plot gives the animals the advantage of a steady supply of nutritive , young herbage and at the same time provides sufficient rest for the pasture to recoup after each grazing . The only disadvantage is that this does not provide time for seed setting and maturity . ( 4 ) Rotational deferred grazing . This system is beneficial when seeding is desired as in annual species and when the perennials do not have sufficient density . The whole pasture is divided into three equal compartments and fenced . Each compartment is grazed continuously for one-third of the total grazing season and protected through the remaining two-third of the season during which time the seeds mature . By the time the animals are allowed to graze the third compartment , the seeds would have been shed . When they go back to first and second compartments the seeds in those would have also ripened and got shed . In the second year the rotation will start from the second compartment and in the third year from the third compartment . Ilohenhehn system . This is an improved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war . In this system , the pasture is divided into many small plots of equal size . Grasses are raised with application of large quantities of nitrogenous fertilizers . The dairy cattle are then divided into three groups , viz. high yielders , medium yielders and low yielders . They are let into the paddock by rotation so that the opportunity for grazing most nutritious immature grasses goes to the high yielders followed by medium producers and lastly low yielders. // FEEDING SHEEP AND GOATS Since sheep and goats are raised almost entirely on roughages , the cost of production will be lower than that of poultry and pigs . Sheep and goats farming due to its quicker and better returns on investment provides an additional source of income to farmers who normally depend on crops for their livelihood . Thus , these animals fit in ideally in a mixed farming system . At present , extensive grazing on marginal grasslands is going on . The indigenous breeds of sheep and goats can subsist under the most adverse circumstances on scanty feeding . But their productivity is very low compared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production , exotic breeds are introduced and crossbred progenies produced . When exotic genes are thus introduced , the whole feeding pattern has to change . The sheep and goat raiser will have to give special attention to feeding their animals to raise them satisfactorily . Supplementary feeding . The animals will graze on crop stubbles , weeds and grasses on fallow as well as range lands . This will meet the requirements of the animals only partially . Their diet may be supplemented with cultivated fodders , grains and oil cakes , especially so during the critical period of production cycle occurring during the period of the year when the nutrient supply is inadequate . Feeding the Breeding Ewe The profits from these enterprise depends largely on the knowledge and ability of the farmer to feed his flock economically and yet derive maximum productivity . For purposes of convenience , the feeding of the ewe will be discussed under the following headings : 1 . Flushing ewes , 2. feeding during breeding , 3. feeding during early and mid-pregnancy , 4. feeding during late pregnancy , 5. feeding at lambing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the time lambs are weaned until flushing time . ( 1 ) Flushing . About two weeks before the onset of the breeding season , nutrition of ewes should be stepped up to promote their body weight . This practice will bring ewes into heat earlier in the season thereby giving early lambs . It also has the effect of bringing the ewes into heat at more nearly the same time than otherwise , resulting in a more uniform lamb crop . Besides , flushing also increases the lambing rate and incidence of multiple births in the flock . Flushing rations for ewes may consist of : ( a ) A good mixed pasture of legumes and grasses , // ( b ) A grass pasture plus 150 grammes of wheat bran per head per day , ( c ) Grass pasture plus 250 grammes of grains and 450 grammes of oil cakes ( d ) Legume hay full fed plus 100 grammes of wheat bran and 150 to 200 grammes of grain and ( e ) Green fodder at the rate of 10 per cent of body weight and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period is usually during the latter half of May , in India . Over . fat ewes . Overfattening will result in excessive fat deposition around ovary and other internal genital organs resulting in reduced fertility . A good shepherd should watch for over fattening at least one and a half to two months before the onset of breeding season . The overfat ewes may be gradually brought down to the desirable lean condition , by reducing the ration and exercising . As and when the farmer gains in experience , his endeavour should be to constantly check and keep the ewes in condition for flushing ( rather on the leaner side ) by mild reduction in feed and providing exercise . ( 2 ) Feeding during breeding season . The ration provided during flushing will continue during breeding season also . ( 3 ) Feeding during ear ! ' and mid-pregnancy . Good feeding during gestation is the keystone for a healthy strong lamb crop . If feeding is inadequate or defective , weak or dead lambs will result . A weak lamb at the start is a liability than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ productive life of an ewe is extended if she receives good feeding during her gestation periods . Proper feeding of the ewes is advantageous in that it : ( i ) increases the number of strong healthy live lambs horn , ( ii ) prolongs the productive life of the ewes , ( iii ) increases milk yield by the ewes resulting in healthier weanlings , ( iv ) improves the wool productivity , ( v ) lessens the incidence of lambing paralysis , and ( vi ) decreases the probabililty of ewes disowning their lambs as a result of exhaustion and weakness . The early and mid-pregnancy period is not very critical nutritionally . This does not mean that the ewes do not need properly balanced ration . It only means that extra nutritional requirements due to pregnancy is not much during early and mid-pregnancy and that the whole of their needs can be met entirely by grazing . Some rations recommended for exotic ewes during this period is as follows : ( 1 ) Grazing . On a good pasture . ( 2 ) Sorghum silage . One to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one kilogram per head per day . // ( 3 ) Ad libitum supply . Plenty of maize or sorghum fodder plus 50 gm of oil cakes like ground nut cake , per head per day . ( 4 ) Grazing on siubbles and harvested fields supplemented with 100 gm of oil cakes per head per day . This period falls from 8 July to September 15 in India . ( 5 ) Feeding during late pregnancy . The period from 16 September to 1 November is the most critical period nutritionally . During the first part of this period ( 16 September to 1 October ) ewes may be allowed to graze on crop aftermaths , wild grasses and weeds . Their ration must be supplemented with available green fodder fed at the rate of five kilogram per head per day . During the last one month of pregnancy ( 2 october to 1 November ) the foetus grows rapidly in the uterus . Lack of enough energy in the feed can cause pregnancy disease or ketosis in ewes . Therefore , molasses or grains ( barley , maize , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 225 gm per head per day . Further , ewes should also receive available green fodder at the rate of seven kilogram per head per day . ( 6 ) Feeding at lambing time . As lambing time approaches or immediately after lambing , the grain allowance should be materially reduced , but good quality dry roughage be fed ? free choice . After parturition the ration of the ewe may be gradually increased so that she receives the full ration in six to seven days time . In general , bulky and laxative feed-stuffs may be included in the ration during the first few days . A mixture of wheat bran and barley or oats at 1 : 1 proportion is excellent . Soon after lambing , the ewe must be given just enough of slightly warm water . As soon as first Iamb is born , set up creep feeders with Iamb starter ' ration . An ideal starter ration can be 16 parts ground nut cake and 84 parts barley grain and available green or dry fodder . ( 7 ) Feeding lactating ewes . Ration for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is necessary for rapid growth of lambs . If they are provided good pasture , the requirements are more or less met . When supplementary feeding is necessary , the amount of additional feed may be calculated as below : An average ewe 's daily pasture requirements can be replaced 50 per cent by 450 gm of good hay , 1.4 kg silage or 250 gm of grain . If they are fed cultivated green fodder , ten kilogram per head is sufficient . ( 8 ) Feeding of ewes from the time lambs are weaned until flushing time . This is the least critical period with respect to nutrient requirements . Ewes may be maintained entirely on pasture . Poor quality pastures and other roughages of low quality can be advantageously // untilised during this period . Feeding Rams for Breeding Rams in normal condition require some additional nutrients during the breeding season . An overfat ram on the other hand needs thinning before the commencement of the breeding season . This may be gradually done by a combination of feed reduction and vigorous exercise . The common practice is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Under such circumstances the rams will get the same ration as the ewes . Usually , it will meet the nutritional requirements of the ram . Where there are facilities for separate feeding of the ram , it may be given half a kilogram of a concentrate mixture consisting of three parts oats or barley , one part maize and one part wheat bran per day . Lamb Feeding Feeding suckling lambs . This is the early . part of a lamb 's life in which it is dependant on its mother 's milk to a considerable degree for its nutrition . This period ends when the lambs are wean-ed . It will be most economical to put the ewes and lambs on good pasture . Grazing on good pasture will sustain milk production of the ewes at a high level . Similarly , the lambs also will nibble at succu-lent green forage . But , the pastures available are often of poor qua-lity and poorly managed . Under such circumstances , the rations of these lambs may be supplemented with grains and oil cakes in addi-tion to their mother 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the availability of pasture , one may decide to raise them or sell them as feeders at weaning time . Feeding early-weaned and orphan lambs . Lambs are usually weaned at five months of age . But early weaning at eight to twelve weeks of age has been found to be advantageous and will intensify the whole operation . Similarly , some lambs may be orphaned due to the death of the ewe or due to disowning by the mother . Young suckling Iambs on creep feeding , early-weaners and orphan lambs must be well fed . Ration for creep feeders , early weaners and orphans . Upto six weeks age , grains should be cracked before feeding to lambs . After this , grains can be fed as such except in the case of hard grains which may be cracked , crimped or rolled . These infant Iambs should get good pasture or high quality legume hay preferably in the pelleted form in addition to the grains . If legume hay or good quality pasture is not available and if only // poor roughage is fed , then their grain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with approximately 12 per cent digestible crude protein . Studies at Ohio State University indicate that lambs can be raised well upto eight weeks with milk from the ewe and dehydrated lucerne pellets . From eight weeks onwards they need grains and oil cakes . Complete pelleted ration consisting of roughage and concentrate , both mixed and made into pellets has been found to be advantageous . Lambs had been found to consume more and grow faster . The pellets are self-fed and the nutrient intake is controlled by varying the composition of the pellets as the capacity of consuming bulk is more or less fixed . To start with , the pellets will have 65 to 70 per cent roughages but decreased gradually to 50 per cent by ten to twelve weeks age . A few recommended rations for the creep feeders and early weavers are as follows : ( i ) Maize 40 per cent , oats 30 per cent , barley 30 per cent plus lucerne hay fed ad libitum. ( ii ) Oats 20 per cent , maize 40 per cent , barley 20 per cent groundnut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iii ) Maize 25 per cent , oats 40 per cent , wheat bran 20 per cent , groundnut cake 15 per cent plus vitamins supplements . ( d ) Feeding from weaning to market . The types of feeds used and the methods of feeding will vary with the economic and climatic conditions and the feeds available . In developing countries , the policy should be to utilize grazing lands , waste lands and aftermath of grain crops as far as possible and supplement whatever is deficient , with harvested good quality fodder , hay or concentrates . Table An average lamb may be fed 225 to 450 gm of a grain mixture // listed in Table 4 depending on the grazing conditions . If there is plenty of grazing 225 gm is sufficient . In over-grazed grass lands they may be given 450 gm of the concentrate mixture plus half to two kilogram of good green fodder . Sheep Grazing Grasslands in India are over-grazed and generally in very poor condition . There is very little attention paid at present to develop the pastures . Improvement of pastures is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All the uncultivated lands can be converted into community pastures with some effort ( Fig. 6.12 ) . Boundaries of pasture should be fenced , land reclaimed , ploughed , irrigated and seeded with lucerne and grasses . Pasture should be divided into compartments for rotational grazing . It should be managed to support 10 to 12 ewes and their lambs , per acre . Farmers keeping animals on pasture should be charged fees on per head per day basis . The amount will be spent on management and upkeep of the pasture . It will be desirable to change the pasture for grazing periodically as sheep consume less due to the monotony of grazing if they have to graze on the same pasture continuously . Feeding of Goats Goats have special feeding habits as different from other ruminants . With the aid of their mobile upper lips and very prehensile tongues goats are able to graze on very short grass and to browse on foliage which is not the common feed of other livestock . Under extensive conditions , goats may be used to convert otherwise useless browse plants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the goats enable them to meet their nutrient requirements in adverse feeding conditions in which quality and quantity of feeds ; mailable are inadequate for other species . Under semi-intensive conditions , supplementing grazing with harvested green fodder and concentrates become necessary . Under intensive system of confinement rearing , all the roughages and concentrates have to be provided . The amounts to be fed depends on body weight , age , physiological status and milk yield . About twothirds of the energy requirements of mature goats should be met through roughages . Half of the roughages should be leguminous ( green lucerne , berseem , peas or hay made out of them ) and the rest half green grasses . Instead of green grasses , tender tree leaves can also be given . Depending on the quality of the forages the fol-
