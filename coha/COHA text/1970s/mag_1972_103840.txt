It is one of the rites of spring in New York , like dodging potholes in the streets and mailing a deposit for the summer cottage out in the Hamptons . As the snow melts each year the Rangers skate boldly into the Stanley Cup playoffs and then skate quickly and quietly out of them . Most seasons the Rangers do not even stay around town long enough to compete with opening day at the baseball parks and the golf courses . In fact , since they last won the cup 32 years ago , the Rangers have survived the first round of the playoffs only twice . And now  --  horrors  --  here were those dastardly Montreal Canadiens waiting to ravage them once again . // Why pick on New York ? Could n't the Canadiens pull a John Lindsay for once and drop out ? Were n't 10 Stanley Cups in 16 years enough ? What else did they want , the city ? They had n't lost a playoff series to a team from the United States in 10 years . And look what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing , though , despite the great Hab Hex the Rangers thought they were going to beat the Canadiens . And all things considered , even with Center Jean Ratelle , their most important player , still sidelined because of a cracked bone above his right ankle , the time was right . No longer did Montreal have Jean Beliveau to dazzle them or Mean John Ferguson to brutalize them . Sure , Ken Dry-den would be in goal for Montreal , but the Rangers had lost only one game to the Canadiens all year  --  a meaningless 6-5 skatefest the last day of the season  --  and had scored almost live goals a game against Dryden while the rest of the league had averaged two . Before the first game Wednesday night , scalpers were getting $120 for a pair of $13 tickets that offered both a terrible view of the ice and the fragrant aroma of circus elephants , compliments of Ringling Bros , and Barnum &amp; Bailey . // Inside Madison Square Garden the Canadiens easily found the way to their dressing room by following the circus signs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his players dressed . " It 's strange , " he said , looking out onto the ice . " New York beat us all year , and we beat Boston and Boston killed New York . The only way we can beat New York now is to play like Boston does . We 've got to stop the Rangers at center ice and not let them get their passing game going . But my guys do n't play like that . The forwards do n't come back and check , and the defense-men back in on Dryden . If we play like that we wo n't be around very long . " // For his part , Emile Francis , the little boss of the Rangers , was preparing a surprise for Bowman and Yvan Cournoyer , the speedy right wing who scored 47 goals for the Canadiens during the season . Francis realized that none of the Rangers he had used regularly was quick enough to derail Cournoyer on his swoops around the rink . The only Ranger who could accelerate with Cournoyer was Gene Carr , a 20-year-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year ago . Normally Francis takes the George Allen approach to youth : he uses his kids only as a last resort . Indeed , for the playoffs he had reacquired two of the Rangers ' old smoothies : Ron Stewart , 39 , and Phil Goyette , 38 . But now he was going to have Carr check Cournoyer , or at least try to . // At the start Bowman felt he had to assign an exclusive shadow to only one Ranger , Left Wing Vic Hadfield , who had scored 50 goals . The obvious choice was Rejean ( Peanuts ) Houle , the pesky wing who covered Bobby Hull so effectively in last year 's cup . However , there is one basic difference between Hull and Hadfield . Hull rarely resorts to physical retaliation over a checker 's attentions . Hadfield does . If Houle planned to shackle Hadfield the way he harassed Hull  --  an elbow here , a stick there  --  then his body eventually would bear some marks , too . Nothing illegal , of course . Just fun and games . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first game for slashing Hadfield , and after that he was just plain ineffective . // Until this season Hadfield had never scored more than 26 goals . The instant he got the puck on his curved stick he would fire it . Occasionally it went in ; most of the time it landed in Section B , Row C , Seat 4 of the mezzanine . " I always got a lot of oohs and ahs , " Hadfield said , " but I did n't get many goals . " So Hadfield changed his style and learned to sneak around behind the defensemen and wait for crisp passes from Ratelle and Right Wing Rod Gilbert . Of his 50 goals , at least 35 were scored from less than five feet away . " He scored 10 goals against us during the year  --  seven or eight against me , " Dryden said . " The longest was no more than four feet . Nowadays most players prefer to shoot from 40 feet out or farther , and here 's Hadfield with 10 goals that probably do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was tied 1-1 near the end of the first period , and there was Hadfield on Dryden 's doorstep as Bobby Rousseau , who replaced Ratelle at center , stole the puck in the corner . " Bobby ! " Hadfield screamed in a voice that could be heard 40 rows away . Rousseau obediently drilled the puck across the crease and Hadfield fired it behind Dryden . " Another four-footer , " the goaltender mumbled . // Frank Mahovlich tied the score 2-2 early in the third period , and for a time it appeared that the teams would skate into overtime . Enter J.C . Tremblay . After Dryden he is Montreal 's make-or-break player . On some nights he is J.C . Superstar ; on others he is J.C . Snowshoes . In Montreal he usually is the former ; on the road , the latter . As one Canadien player said , " Sometimes J.C . forgets to pack his courage when we go on the road . " // Yet it was Tremblay who risked his life to save others from a hotel fire in St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrowly escaped . // " You would n't believe it was J.C . up there dangling from a ladder , " a teammate said , " but it was . I ca n't tell you how courageous he was . " // After a strong start against New York , Tremblay somehow got stuck in reverse and spent the rest of the game skating backward on Dryden . With slightly more than seven minutes remaining , Tremblay had the puck in the corner to Dryden 's left . " I started to make my deke on Gilbert , " he said later , " and the puck got away from me . " It rolled to Rousseau . Again Hadfield was parked at Dryden 's crease . " Bobby ! " he yelled . The puck was there in a flash . Dryden was beaten on another four-footer and the Rangers won the game 3-2. // " We 've got to watch Hadfield , " Tremblay said . " That 's the trouble , " said another Canadien . " We 've been watching him . " // The following night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but in rapid order Defenseman Dale Rolfe and Stewart both scored from the goal mouth to put the Rangers ahead . // Later Tremblay took a puck in the face and went off for 10 stitches , so Terry Harper came on to replace him . Harper rivals Chicago 's Keith Magnuson for the annual gamest player award . He will challenge and tight anyone , and though he usually loses , he does inspire his more reluctant mates to greater efforts . When Harper appeared , bodies began to crash , and suddenly Hadfield lost his mortgage on the patch of ice to Dryden 's right . Playing their best hockey since the start of the series , the Canadiens tied the score in the second period and continued to dominate play until Harper and Hadfield clashed in the last minute of the period . // Harper was sitting on the bench when Hadfield skated past and brushed him with his stick . " Because of my injured thumb I ca n't control my stick very well , " Hadfield explained , smiling . " When I skated past their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from me . " At the next whistle Harper leaped from the bench , skated toward Hadfield and unloaded a left elbow , but it missed . The two jawed for several minutes , until Francis removed Hadfield and sent out Glen Sather , his No. 1 disturber . " I told Sather to whisper sweet nothings in Harper 's ear , " Francis said . " I told him to tell Harper what a nice fellow he is. " // Sather , who spent one summer taking graduate courses in child psychology at Memphis State University , told Harper he liked the way he parted his hair . Up came the elbows . Up came the sticks . And both were penalized . " That Sather , he 's a master , " Francis said . " Hey , we 're all kids , are n't we ? " was what Sather said . // Sather 's enterprise obviously stirred the Rangers , for they roared out for the third period and scored three times to take the game 5-2 . The winning goal came only 20 seconds into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from about 15 feet . Dryden blamed himself for the goal . " I lost track of the net , " he said . " I made a terrible play . No excuses . " // Carr dominated Cournoyer , holding him to only two shots , but the Canadiens were able to stymie Hadfield , too , thanks mostly to Harper 's body bending . Goalie Eddie Giacomin played solidly for the Rangers in both games and New York 's penalty killing was spectacular , with Fairbairn and Walt Tkaczuk handling the puck so effectively that the Canadians had no shots at Giacomin during four of their eight power plays . // As the series switched to Montreal , Bowman mapped a few changes : he planned to get Cournoyer away from Carr . He would have Henri Richard and Claude Larose , two of his most industrious skaters , play head-to-head against Tkaczuk and Fairbairn , respectively . " The only way to stop them is to outwork them if you can , " Bowman said . // The scalpers in Montreal were getting only $60 for a pair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for what Francis predicted would be a physical game . " I have n't told my guys to hit and I have n't told them not to hit , " Bowman said . The Canadiens hit . Peter Mahovlich dazed Fairbairn with a vicious elbow , then Jacques Laperriere smashed Bruce MacGregor into the boards . Hadfield came onto the ice and gave Harper a hard shot , and three Canadiens hacked away at Hadfield in return . Jacques Lemaire slammed Brad Park into the boards , then Peter Mahovlich slashed Fairbairn . Before the period was 16 minutes old the Canadiens had been given 10 minutes in penalties , and they had to play almost nine of those first 16 minutes shorthanded. // Miraculously they escaped , thanks to Dryden . For many minutes the Rangers passed the puck back and forth along the crease . It looked like a Ping-Pong game with Dryden the judge . Ken robbed Hadfield , then Goyette , then Gilbert , then Tkaczuk , then Gilbert again . " I think the Rangers just got tired from passing the puck around and did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Dryden said . Francis kept shaking his head . " I have never in all my days seen so many passes go through the crease without getting into the net , " he said . // Once past that barrage the Canadiens played a style of hockey they had not exhibited in New York . Tremblay was marvelous , having one of his J.C . Superstar nights . Montreal defensemen continually stopped the Rangers at the blue line , and in the second period the Canadiens broke through on the power play as Frank Mahovlich converted a perfect pass from brother Pete . Later in the period Marc Tardif backhanded a 15-footer past Giacomin after Rod Seiling had blocked his original shot . // Montreal made one defensive lapse in the period when Ron Stewart sneaked behind the defense , took a pass from Sather and beat Dryden cleanly , but after that Dryden and Tremblay kept the situation under control , and the Canadiens won 2-1. // " It 's pretty simple , " Harper said afterward . " When we do n't let them stand around and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are spectators , we lose . " // Back at the Forum on Sunday night the teams went on a scoring binge . First to hit was Fairbairn for New York , then Rousseau , then Lemaire for the Canadiens , followed by Rousseau once more , Montreal 's Tardif and the man who wanted to reclaim his old property adjacent to Dryden , Vic Hadfield . This was all in the first period and the Rangers led 4-2 . No muscle to speak of was utilized by either side , possibly because the teams were playing their fourth game in five nights and were willing to let the sticks talk . // Montreal gained a little in the second period with a goal by Cournoyer and got another in the third from Harper to tie it up and lift the Forum 's lid . But with five minutes remaining one Pete Stemkowski stole the puck from guess who  --  yep , Tremblay  --  and beat Dryden . An empty-net goal made it 6-4 and a 3-1 lead in the series for little old New York . // Ah , spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
