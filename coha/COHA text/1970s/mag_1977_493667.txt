Guaranteed Jobs for Economists After many months , President Carter has been talked into accepting the Humphrey-Hawkins bill , a proposal known officially as the Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act of 1977 . The title is a clue to what lies inside . In the form now settled on , the bill amounts to a promise to make a promise each year to improve the economy , create jobs and put a chicken in every pot . Senator Hubert Humphrey of Minnesota and Representative Augustus Hawkins of California , in keeping with the spirit of the bill , promised to get it through Congress quickly . Likewise , on November 14 , the President promised to sign it as soon as it is passed . They must be cheering in the Bronx . The clunky phrasing of Humphrey-Hawkins is easy to ridicule , and several newspapers have already done so . The most recent example comes from Richard Nixon 's former economic advisor , Herbert Stein , who introduced a parody bill of his own in the Wall Street Journal . It was called the " Full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan to reduce the " unmarriage rate " to four percent and use the powers of the federal government to " promote meaningful relationships . " A handful of conservatives takes it more seriously than this , saying it will create inflation . Liberal editorialists have dismissed it as a toothless tiger . Senator Humphrey 's assistant , Timothy Barnicle , who has worked on the proposal for years , said last week that " the press is more cynical about it than the politicians . " He thinks that the world has been a bit hasty in its judgment , and he predicts that the same people who argue now that the bill is too weak will be arguing next March that it is too strong . The congressmen who persuaded Carter to endorse the plan believe they have accomplished something important , Barnicle says , and that judgment seems reliable to him . His case , which he defends vigorously , is that Humphrey-Hawkins will change the character of debate on economic decisions and " increase the political stakes . " While it does not require the government to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it does attempt to focus policymaking on two or three key promises each year . I his in itself is an achievement , Barnicle says , for the first step in getting a President to do something is getting him to say plainly that he will do it . In specific terms , the bill requires the President to file an economic report each year with Congress . The report must set forth " the current and foreseeable trends in the levels of unemployment , production , real income , productivity and prices , and a review and analysis of recent developments affecting economic trends in the United States . " That 's the beginning . Once the President has finished with forecasts , he must set out " annual numerical goals for five years for employment and unemployment , production . . " et cetera . At this point , the drafters of the bill took leave of self-restraint and pencilled in some of the numbers they want to hear . They could n't wait for the President to choose them himself . The goals for the first report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rate of no more than three percent for civilians aged 20 or over , 5 and to no more than four percent for those over lb years . Step three : after setting goals , the President must describe the " program and policies " he will undertake to achieve them . In addition , the bill divides the tasks into short-term and medium-term goals , sets regional and structural reform goals , youth employment and job training goals , requires congressional approval , takes inflation into account and requires the President 's budget to " be consistent " with his goals . Many procedures are laid out in detail , and the whole document reads like an office memo , not public law . Suffice it to say that the new system is meant to " hold the President 's feet to the fire , " in Barnicle 's words . Every year he will be compelled to make a promise and to explain why things are or are not going as promised the year before . Humphrey , Hawkins and their cosponsors are probably correct in their guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of attention . It will make numbers even more important in congressional debate than they are now and impose more rigorous econometric rules on politics . But what will it contribute ? Not a solution to the plagues of inflation and unemployment . It may contribute instead a new way of looking at things , an economist 's vision of public life . Humphrey and Hawkins , and now Carter , have accepted the idea that the government will know better what to do and behave more compassionately in making economic decisions if it sees the world as an economist does . We are not convinced of this . We submit that the economist 's view is not necessarily clearer than the politician 's . And we doubt that congressional talk will be made more lucid by shifting it away from standard English toward a more thickly orthodox economese . We can imagine nothing more stultifying than a debate in a parliament of bad economists . Quite without the help of mechanisms in this bill , we know today that millions of Americans who want to work can not find jobs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their elders and that black young people as a group face a future that rightly can be called desperate . The President wants to change this , and so does Congress . They can not decide which way to go , but knowing they can not be idle , they vote for more of what 's been done before . Businesses will be given new tax breaks next year , and at the same time hundreds of thousands of public jobs but not enough ) are being created for the unemployed poor who live in cities . The federal government has undertaken to subsidize city and state budgets through other channels as well , largely for the purpose of keeping the employment statistics up . What does the Full Employment Act add to all this ? Goals and timetables , that 's what . It says : " Faster , please , and with more jargon . " Deadline Time For ERA The question of extending the time limit for ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment for seven more years will come before Congress early next year . For those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eliminating all varieties of sex discrimination in this country ? and we do -- it 's tempting to support the proposed extension without much reflection . ERA advocates warn that if the extension is not granted , ratification may not be successful in this generation or the next . The proposed ERA left Congress in March 1072 . In the next year , it passed 30 of the 38 state legislatures necessary for ratification . By March 1075 , only four more states were needed , After that , momentum shifted . Only one more state has been added ? Indiana , this year . Attempts to ratify in other states have failed many times . Three state legislatures which previously ratified the amendment ? Nebraska , Tennessee , Idaho ? have since passed bills purporting to rescind their ratification , The legal validity of these attempted rescissions is not clear . Despite the commitment of the Fords and the Carters , and despite lopsided majorities in the public opinion polls favoring ratification , the ERA has been nearly at a standstill for the past two years . Congress applied to ERA the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That deadline is only 15 months away , and this occasions the move for extension . Those promoting the extension argue that the time limit is not sacrosanct . Before the 18th Amendment in 1917 , there was no time limit for ratification . The custom began only because someone discovered unratified amendments , proposed as far back as I 8o0 , with no date for expiration , floating around in the states . Many were unsuited to the times and no longer desired , but they could become effective at any time , with ratifications years back and under different circumstances counting toward the required two-thirds total . Proponents also contend that the seven-year figure need not be invariable . Seven years may be appropriate for amendments that are easily understood ( like the 18-year-old vote or prohibition ) . But those as ambiguous and potentially far-reaching as the ERA require a larger job of public education , and hence more time . The ERA , of course , is still vital , still very much responsive to the needs that inspired it Thus , they ( continued on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to kill it with the imposition of an arbitrary time limit than to grant an extension . Even if Congress has the power under the Constitution to extend the time limit , we have some reservations about the idea . Time allowed for ratification never has been extended before , and it may prove a shortsighted political strategy . The ERA is the only constitutional amendment on the liberal agenda . On the right , where all the action is these days , there is a passel of amendments ? against abortion , against busing , for school prayer , and abolishing federal indebtedness . They also are warming up the machinery in Article Five of the Constitution ( and never before used ) that provides for the calling of a new constitutional convention that could pass amendments to its heart 's delight and bypass the ratification procedure entirely . If any of these becomes an active possibility ? particularly the constitutional convention idea ? we liberals might be happy for a reputation of particular probity and decorum when it comes to constitutional amendments . It is also likely that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whit . Proponents of the ERA contend that once a state legislature has endorsed a proposed constitutional amendment , it can not change its mind . So far , the Justice Department has supported the position that rescissions are ineffective . But this position is harder to maintain if proponents of the amendment are allowed to extend the time limit indefinitely . It does n't seem quite fair that one side can change its mind but the other can not . It also undermines the apparent purpose of the ratification machinery that two-thirds of the states approve of a new amendment simultaneously . The Supreme Court has never squarely decided either the rescission question or the extension question . An attempt to extend the deadline may set the wheels in motion for a final decision on both these issues , and it may not be one ERA supporters will be pleased with . The mood of this country definitely has shifted ? note the abortion battle in Congress ? and the momentum of the ERA has been reversed . Surely it 's at least as likely that a few more states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years and the right to do it , as it is that the legislatures of the Deep South and the Mormon West will collapse and pass the Amendment . Finally , there is an elemental notion of fairness involved here . The seven-year period set for ratification of constitutional amendments is a neutral procedure , universally understood and applied and relied on by all sides . Because the rule is not demonstrably unfair , we suspect that changing it now would undermine support for ERA among the general public . Merely suggesting it is more ammunition in Phyllis Schlafly 's arsenal . Constitutional provisions , especially ones with large symbolic content such as the ERA , can not be made effective by courts alone . Theyrequire , if not the support , at least the acquiescence of people in general . That is unlikely to come if people feel the ERA has been " snuck through . " The 27th Amendment is not on the books right now primarily because right-thinking men never have accorded it a high priority . There are some highly placed male politicians in this country who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't done much more . Then too , it 's a basic prescript of politics that you try to make it easy for a politician to deliver on his pledges , not more difficult , and the women 's movement has gotten a little diffuse and distracted lately . For all the good spirit and consciousness raising that emerged from Houston , those who feared that a critical priority item like ERA might get lost in the expanding and shuffling priorities of the women 's agenda were right . There is nothing like a deadline to concentrate the mind , and ERA proponents of both sexes could use a dose of that right now . On balance , a seven-year extension seems a risky dodge . We 're against it , and we hope the Congress will kill it early so it does n't drain off energy , money and time that could he better spent elsewhere , in places like Georgia , Florida , North Carolina , Nevada and Illinois .                    @
