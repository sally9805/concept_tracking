txt Americans Find Mexico No Drug Haven By JUAN de ONIS Special to The New York Times MEXICO CITY , July 18 ? At least 187 United States citizens are in prison in Mexico on narcotics charges ? among them at least a dozen young stuI dents or vacationers who were arrested with small amounts of marijuana in their possession . Some of the Americans are drug addicts and others have police records in the United States for trafficking in drugs . The consequences of arrest in Mexico on drug charges can he more serious now than in the United States , largely because of the strenuous effort Washington has been making to obtain stronger action by the Mexican authorities against drug traffic across the border . Furthermore , an American , once arrested , faces badly crowded prisons rife with violence and corruption . The Americans are held in 22 penitentiaries and jails , from border cities such as Tijuana , Nogales and Ciudad Judrez , where some were seized trying to smuggle drugs into the United States , to tourist centers such as Acapulco and Mazatlan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most of the prisons are badly ! overcrowded . The Juarez jail , for example , has more than 800 people in facilities built for 300 . In some institutions visited by this correspondent , the Americans  --  their number , according to United States consulates , has increased threefold in nine months  --  share with Mexican criminals the personal insecurity , sexual abuse , and corruption that characterize prison life here . Knives are the commonplace possessions // Americans Find Mexico No Drug Haven With money sent by family or friends , Americans and others who are more prosperous can buy extra food and cigarettes at a " commissary " run by one of the prisoners who has influence with the authorities as well as outside connections . An insipid plate of beans is the standard prisonfare . It usually takes up to $1,000 for those Americans who can raise money to pay for the f lawyers who frequent the pri'sons and who claim influence with judges to move up trial dates and arrange light sentences . The Americans are often ? tricked into large , fruitless payments . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can legally set bail . Drug charges , including the transportation of marijuana , can involve sentences as long as 12 years , but first offenders arrested with small quantities generally get lighter sentences . The standard way out of ' Mexico in such cases is to forfeit bail , which runs from $250 to $500 , and skip across the border . The prison experience has confirmed some Americans in a cynical attitude toward Mexican law enforcement and justice . Some say they would have avoided jail if they had bribed the policemen who arrested them . Shakedown Attempts Described There are numerous reports , some of which have been made privately to the United States consulates , that drug arrests often begin as attempts to shake down visitors who have been sold marijuana by police agents . " The trouble is , you do n't know Spanish and you are all confused when they get you , so you do n't pay off before they get you to a judge , " said a student who was arrested while trying to smuggle 150 pounds of marijuana into the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you become just a body here to be ransomed . " The Mexican campaign against drugs has growing public support since the publicizing of evidence that marijuana and amphetamine pills are being sold widely in high schools and in nightclubs frequented by teen-agers . Since October the federal police have made 1.378 arrests , including 204 foreigners , mostly Americans . President Gustavo Diaz Ordaz has given orders to the Attorney General and the Ministry of Defense to pursue a program of eradicating marijuana and opium-poppy plantations and to increase surveillance of highway , airplane and ship movements of marijuana and " hard " drugs . Vastly Lucrative Trade Mexico is the largest single source of marijuana smuggled into the United States and is also an important way station for heroin from Europe and cocaine from South America . In addition to amateur marijuana smugglers on trips from the United States , the enormously lucrative trade involves well-organized , heavily financed professional rings that have built up their business through political payoffs and police protection . This week , to intensify a joint United States-Mexican program set up in January @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexico $1-million worth of helicopters and light airplanes equipped with sensor devices and weed killers to support the eradication campaign . Agreement has also been reached to assign the Mexican customs service the responsibility for control of drug traffic to match strength- ' ened customs control on the United States side of the border . The cooperative measures are considered by the United States authorities to be important steps forward from the situation last September , when the ? Nixon Administration shocked Mexican officials by imposing a virtual blockade of the border for 10 days to halt smuggling through customs points . The severe inspections caused distruption of commerce and delays in the daily movement of thousands of Mexicans who work and shop in United States border cities from Texas to California , as well es of many American tourists , and there were complaints from Mexican officials and Chambers of Commerce . Operation Cooperation grew out of long negotiations that followed a relaxation of the inspections .

There are also at least 15 persons who are under indictment in the United States on drug charges but who remain at large here . // of men who have records u homicide . Convicted killers and heroin addicts are thrown with others in prisons where the only men behind bars are in solitary confinement . During a recent two-week period in one prison there were three stabbings , one fatal , in the presence of Americans . The guards , following the code that prevails in Mexican prisons did not intervene . " One guy was stabbed for 8 cents , " said a 21-year-old American who graduated from a Middle Atlantic university last year . A principal cause of assaults is the addicts ' need for money to buy heroin , which is readily available at a price through guards or trusties who enjoy special privileges as dealers . A dose of " bad " heroin sells for a dollar , a prisoner said .

Most prisoners held by a judge on narcotics charges can expect to spend at least six months in custody before their cases come to trial . Court dockets are jammed , and there is only one judge in most districts . Since last year judges have not been granting bail . In most prisons a man can gain some measure of personal safety and comfort by buying from the warden a cell in a " privileged " section , separate from the dormitories , where prisoners sleep on bunk racks stacked five high , with about a foot of headroom between bunks . Two Americans in a typical institution share a cubicle 8 feet long and 5 feet wide , with a bunk bed and a pile of blankets . An electric fan , a few books , toilet articles and a girl 's photo occupy the only shelf .
