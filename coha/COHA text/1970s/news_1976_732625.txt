txt A CITY investigation is under way to determine if consumers are being defrauded by radio and television repair firms . Jane Byrne , commissioner of the city 's Department of Sales , Weights , and Measures , said Monday she would like to see TV and radio repairmen licensed by the city to provide better control over possible deceptive practices . The investigation was triggered by a Chicago Tribune Task Force series on consumer abuses by auto mechanics . Byrne said . " After the Tribune series , " she said , " we kept getting letters saying , ' So far so good , but how about the radio and TV repairmen ? Do we have to wait for the newspapers to investigate them before something is done ? ' " We checked our files and found that radio and TV repairmen complaints p'oduced the second highest volume received in my office , following only auto mechanic complaints . " LAST YEAR , Byrne said , her office received 120 complaints about radio and TV repairs . Thus far this year , her office received 81 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even higher after our investigation is publicized . " In some cases , Byrne said , her office has been able to mediate complaints against TV and radio repairmen , often getting bills adjusted or getting defective sets returned or traded . She added , however , that if a licensing law went into effect , the city would test the repairmen to determine if they are properly trained . " RIGHT NOW , " Byrne said , " you can look in the Yellow Pages and see repair . men advertised as ' authorized , ' but authorized by whom ? " She said she would like to see an ordinance regarding TV and radio repair similar to the ordinance being considered by the City Council regarding auto repair . The auto repair proposal calls for a $200 licensing fee and provides provisions for cancellation of the license for deceptive practices . The proposal also provides that mechanics must present specific estimates to the consumer prior . to doing any work on the car .                @ @ @ @ @
