txt After more than four weeks of wrangling and intermittent deadlock , the Senate approved today the basic outline of a tax on " windfall " profits that will divert $178 billion from the oil industry to the Government over the next 11 years . The Senate will not formally complete action on its version of the measure for another day or two , but agreement between supporters and critics of the tax on a key amendment broke a , deadlock and raised the possibility of sending President Carter a final draft before Christmas . The revenue figure in the Senate bill represents a qualified victory for the White House , which was highly critical of the $138 billion measure that emerged from the Senate Finance Committee . At one point , that revenue figure dropped to $128 billion but then rose an additional $50 billion in a series of steps . Bill May Be Considered Next Week The version of the legislation approved last June by the House of Representatives would raise $276 billion . A conference committee , which could begin deliberations next week , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senate voted by 78 to 13 late today to add a $23 billion minimum tax provision to the oil tax bill , a feature that had been hammered out in closed negotiating sessions over the last several days . Opponents of the bill , generally Republicans and oil-state Democrats , agreed to accept some tax on newly discovered oil , which had been totally exempted by the Finance Committee . A factor in their acquiescence was the higher prices announced yesterday by four members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ? Saudi Arabia , Venezuela , the United Arab Emirates and Qatar . Earlier Accord Collapsed An earlier agreement , negotiated by Senator Robert C. Byrd , the Democratic majority leader , collapsed when some liberal Democrats called it too soft on the industry in the light of billions of additional dollars the higher world price would assure for domestic producers . The amendment finally approved by the Senate will impose a 10 percent tax on revenue derived from newly discovered oil above a floor of $20 a barrel . The current market price is $23.50 and it Is expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Together with a 20 percent tax on both heavy oil and tertiary recovery , the amendment will produce $23 billion over 11 years . Other versions of the minimum tax that failed to win agreement ranged from $15 billion to $25 billion . Senator Byrd scheduled a full working session of the Senate for tomorrow and said he was hopeful that work on the bill might be completed then . A major obstacle is disposing of an amendment that would subject oil income received by state and local governments to the tax . Such a move is strongly opposed by Senator Russell B. Long , Democrat of Louisiana , the Finance Committee 's chairman , who has threatened to kill any bill incorporating such a feature . There are a number of other amendments to the tax bill pending , but none that are likely to alter the $178 billion revenue figure materially . Many are not directly related to the measure and will be prohibited if the Senate votes to restrict debate . For the third consecutive day today , a cloture motion failed to muster the 60 votes required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , that such a majority would be on hand to approve a cloture motion on Monday , if the oil tax debate lasts that long . Senators cast 56 votes for restricted debate today , but there were four absentees who had supported cloture earlier , so that Senator Byrd predicted confidently that such a motion would carry on Monday . The oil price increases announced yesterday by the four OPEC producers and the additional announcements expected on Monday at the OPEC meeting in Caracas , Venezuela , will inevitably increase domestic oil industry profits dramatically and , accordingly , raise Government income from the oil profit tax . The last OPEC increase in June came while the House was debating its version of the bill and all the figures involved had to be revised upward by billions of dollars . Some senators believe it would be possible to reconcile the Senate and House bills in
