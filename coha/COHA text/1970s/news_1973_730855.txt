txt The political impact of the Kennedy-Wallace get-together in Alabama is already being assessed here as a " feeler " by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of the 1976 presidential wind . As this is written , just before the Senator was to mount the same platform with Gov . George C. Wallace in Decatur , Ala. , this appraisal of their meeting there was being made by political observers here : ? For Senator Kennedy it was a strong indication that the Massachusetts Democrat had lost at least some of his disinclination to run for president which has been based , at least in large part , on the fears of the Kennedy family that such a candidacy might make him the target of violence . Without undue risk Senator Kennedy is known to believe that this threat has eased , perhaps to the point where he might make a presidential bid without taking undue risk . ? For Governor Wallace it was a show to the home folks that his acceptability had moved far beyond the strictly white , conservative , Southern identification of the past . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this gesture of goodwill , is embracing the other politically . // * Kennedy in ' 76 ? // Senator Kennedy says he is honoring Governor Wallace for his courage in the aftermath of the assassination attempt made on the Alabama Democrat during the last presidential campaign . Mr. Wallace welcomes Mr. Kennedy for this act of personal kindness . But at no point does he endorse any of Senator Kennedy 's philosophy ? or Mr. Kennedy himself as a possible presidential candidate . ? Both men take political risks in this little " summit " meeting in Alabama . Mr. Wallace 's " hard hat " supporters and those generally who like his hard line on race issues may ' view this as a sign that he is softening . And Democratic liberals ? and particularly the black community ? may find this get-together more than they can bear . On the other hand , both groups may merely view the Kennedy visit to Governor Wallace as wholly a commendable act of goodwill on the Senator 's part .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
