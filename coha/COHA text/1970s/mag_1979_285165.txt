COVER STORY <P> Ted decides he has to take on Jimmy , and a tumultuous campaign begins <P> It is smoky and sweltering in the high-ceilinged Pennsylvania Room at the Sheraton Hotel on John F. Kennedy Boulevard in Philadelphia . Some 300 Democrats have paid $250 each to attend a fund-raising reception , but instead of bunching around the bar and the hors d'oeuvres table , they are jostling for position at the door , waiting for the main attraction . " I do hope I can just see him , " an elderly woman gushes . <P> Suddenly , Ted Kennedy strides into the room , his flushed face beaming and his right hand reaching out . " Ooh , " squeals an elegantly coiffed woman . " He shook my hand . Did you see that ? This hand right here . " Kennedy sweeps through the room , bellowing in his Boston accent , " Hi , how are you , good to see you . " " Go , Teddy ! " someone yells . Kennedy gives a short pep talk for the object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to introduce the man who will be the next mayor of Philadelphia , " Kennedy says . Green takes the microphone and shouts : " I want to thank the man who will be the next . . . " He is drowned out by laughter and applause . <P> An hour later , showered and changed into a fresh dark-blue suit and white shirt , Kennedy is on the podium in the Sheraton 's grand ballroom . He has been working on his address until the last moment , and sometimes he stumbles over the notes in the margins , but he is one of the most effective stump speakers in the country , and his vigorous attack on Jimmy Carter comes through loud and clear . Though he does not mention the President by name , the words leader and leadership keep recurring , 17 times in all . This is Ted Kennedy 's main theme , tonight and in the long months ahead . Scoffing at Carter 's suggestion that the Government 's powers to solve problems are limited , Kennedy sounds a more ebullient tone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counsels of defeat and despair , excuses for leadership that has failed to do its job . " He echoes , deliberately and inevitably , the older brothers who were assassinated . " We can light those beacon fires again , " he promises . " From the hilltops of America , we can send another call to arms , a call for more effective action on all the challenges we face . " The crowd of 600 partisan Democrats roars in approval , and when Kennedy strides off the stage , the six-piece band in the balcony plays music from Camelot . <P> Twenty minutes after that , at a rally of 3,000 working-class Democrats in South Philadelphia , Kennedy clambers onto a table . He has no text . His sentences are simpler . His speech strikes a booming rhythm , and the crowd chants in response to him . " At other times in our history when we were facing problems , we did n't throw up our hands in despair . " " No ! " shouts the crowd . " We did n't talk about malaise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes the reply . " We rolled up our sleeves . " " Yes ! " the people shout . " And set out on the job to be done . " <P> " Yes ! " " And we can do it again . " The crowd begins to chant : " We want Teddy ! Teddy ! Teddy ! " * <P> The last of the Kennedy brothers , the youngest , the most vulnerable , the most thoroughly political , is finally running for
