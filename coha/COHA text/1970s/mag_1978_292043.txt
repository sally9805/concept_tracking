" Socialism in its various manifestations is now the world 's dominant political and economic ideology , " says World Editor John Elson , who edited this week 's eleven-page report on the proliferation of the left . To back up his statement , Elson had at hand some formidable evidence : a foot-high pile of reports filed by 24 TIME correspondents around the world who assessed the consequences of the global revolution . <P> For many of our correspondents , working on this report was the culmination of a deep , ongoing interest in socialism . Eastern Europe Bureau Chief David Aikman , for example , concentrated on modern Russian and Chinese history while a doctoral student at the University of Washington . As our Hong Kong correspondent , he covered the People 's Republic of China . Traveling in Eastern Europe for this week 's story , Aikman talked with a variety of individuals , from tractor drivers on collective farms to bank managers , and found that " few people had given a thought to socialism as a philosophical entity , and none were really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <P> One of the fascinations of compiling such a story was documenting the startling contrasts of worldwide socialism . While Moscow Bureau Chief Marsh Clark watched Soviet President <P> Leonid Brezhnev receive visitors in a gilt room once used by Catherine the Great . Correspondent Lee Griggs recalled witnessing the beginnings of a dozen socialist countries when he was our man in Africa from 1959 to 1962 and again from 1972 to 1977 . " The ceremonies , which were usually held in the soccer stadium of the new capital city , were full of joy , " says Griggs . " At midnight , as the old colonial flag was lowered and the new flag was raised , the crowd would cheer and fireworks would greet the birth of a nation . Yet when I revisited those countries a few years later , the promises of socialism had become the ploys of power politics . " <P> The special report was written by Associate Editor Burton Pines and researched by Ursula Nadasdy de Gallo . Pines , who taught European history at the University of Wisconsin and served as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also conceived the remarkable map that accompanies the story . Designed by Paul Pugliese , the head of our map department , and researched by Noel McCoy , the map shows the economic system , standard of living , and degree of political freedom in 134 countries . The result is a visual representation of the political phenomenon of our times .
