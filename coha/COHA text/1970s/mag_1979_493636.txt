I came to the writing of biography through Lytton Strachey . My imagination was fired when li was a girl by reading a copy of Eminent Victorians in my parents ' house in North Oxford . For me , that moment when I read his essay on Cardinal Manning was , in its modest way , like the moment when Gibbon was in Rome and heard the sound of Vespers on the Spanish steps : his vocation came to him . He would write the history of the decline and fall of the Roman Empire . What I admired about Lytton Strachey ? and still do admire , incidentally ? was his immense readability . I naturally assumed that his research was impeccable . The idea of peccable research ? if there is such a word ? was quite foreign to me , and it was n't until much much later , reading Michael Holroyd 's admirable biography of Lytton Strachey , that I realized how very peccable much of it was . Nevertheless the seed was planted that biography could be exciting , that information could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was a very important lesson to have learned so early . Mercifully it survived three years studying history at Oxford and many more bringing up children , until the moment , having written on antique dolls and toys ( which fitted my nursery way of life ) I was ready to embark on my first biography , that of Lulu Antonia Fraser is the author of Royal Charles : Charles II and the Restoration ( Alfred A. Knopf. ) about several . ) This new reviewer Although Mary Queen of Scots is by no means the subject of my recent study , I learned so many lessons in researching and writing my Mary Queen of Scots ? and also incidentally from my readers afterward ? about the nature of biography , that 1 must dwell on her for a moment , on royal Mary as a preface to royal Charles . First of all , I tackled the character of Mary Queen of Scots from an uncommitted angle , if I may use such an unfashionable word . Partly out of ignorance and a rather open mind , I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did my research in the most conscientious way I knew how , learning 16th-century Scots , for example , to read the documents ? not something I would do for just anyone !  --  visiting France , Scotland , working in innumerable libraries , and wherever possible working from the primary sources . I did not approach her character in order to prove anything about her I imagined 1 knew already . Of course I had had a notion from childhood of Mary Queen of Scots as a very glamorous person , but I did not aim to prove that she was an ill-used creature , or a sex maniac , to cite but two possibilities . By reading Queen Mary 's letters in the first instance , and other material later , I believe that I was able to build up a much truer picture than if I had approached her nature with a preconception . In his book On Historians , Professor Hexter quotes Donald Kagan as dividing historians into " lumpers and splitters . " This division , Professor Hex-ter believes , is far more effective than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that between Marxists and non-Marxists . I quote Professor Hexter : " Historians who are splitters , ' " that is those who like " to point out divergences , to perceive differences .. do not mind untidiness and accident in the past : they rather like them " Lumpers , that is those who " want to put all the past into tidy boxes . . . do not like accidents ; they would prefer to have them vanish . " Now if the analogy is carried through to biography , I think biographers can be divided into provers and inquirers . Provers want to prove o thesis about a given person , and will rake their material very thoroughly ? that is not in question ? in order to establish it . Inquirers , on the other hand , will read the same material with an open mind and ask themselves not how can I prove X , but what does this material prove ? In short , one might sum up the two schools of biographers even more simply as " Hows " and " Whats . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her letters that Mary Queen of Scots was a sexually passionate woman ' As opposed to : what do her letters prove about Mary Queen of Scots ? I found her , incidentally , fascinating but not passionate , more interested in power than in sex . By temperament , I am a " whatter " and my researches about Queen Mary confirmed my view that I would never have discovered the facts I did if I had approached her from the stereotyped point of view of so many other books . Coming on , then , to the subject of King Charles II ( 1630-85 ) it was invaluable that I was a " whatter . " Here the equivalent of Mary 's alleged passionate nature is the delusive catch phrase about Charles ? the Merry Monarch . So delusive is it ? in England certainly ? that my English publisher kept optimistically advertising the book in advance in their trailer catalogues as " the coming biography of the Merry Monarch . " But to me , one of the important discoveries I made about King Charles II , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if anything he was a melancholy monarch , although that is n't a quite accurate phrase either . But the conventional picture of this roisterous fellow ? a girl at each elbow , chucking Nell Gwynn under the chin and enjoying her oranges , a spaniel somewhere around ? no , this simply did not emerge at ail . Yet it would have been easy to have discovered that evidence had I been specifically looking for it . After all here is a man who lid love pleasure . King Charles himself said on the subject of sin to Bishop Burnet that he rated falsehood and cruelty the two greatest sins . But God , he was convinced , would never damn a man " for allowing himself a little pleasure . " The pleasures he loved certainly included women . The roll call of his mistresses is an impressive one , from Lucy Walter , his first mistress , to Louise Duchess of Portmouth , his last . Then , he loved the theater , and it was thanks to his patronage that actors and actresses , hitherto a rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the great English racing center of Newmarket owed everything to his patronage . He took part himself ? it was n't just a spectator sport ? and he rode and won a race when he was 45 , which the reports make clear was due to his horsemanship , not the sycophancy of courtiers giving way to their king . Charles II also loved gardens and all aspects of what we would now call the environment ? town and garden planning . The fire of London , appalling storyas it was , did give the opportunity of replanning London ; Windsor Castle and St. James Park both owe an enormous amount to his replanning , although the fact is sometimes ignored because King George IV came afterward and replanned it again . Charles made St. James Park into a wonderful place of popular recreation , introducing gondolas onto the new canals , rare birds , including a pair of pelicans from Astrakhan , a present From the Russian ambassador . All this , and he loved swimming ( five a.m. in the Thames ? ugh ? the courtiers did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love of dogs was another thing the courtiers had reserved feelings about : I always imagine they felt as present day courtiers are alleged to do about Queen Elizabeth ll 's corgis . " God bless your Majesty , but God damn your dogs " cried one stalwart after being nipped , for the king 's dogs were extremely spoiled . Now this was obviously a man who was not indifferent to pleasure . I would go further and say that King Charles II was a genuine hedonist . Yet the more I examined his extraordinary and dramatic life , the more I realized that he could not possibly be described as merry . " A happy childhood ? the boy in the Van Dyck pictures ? yes , loved by his parents and loving them in return But how was this a preparation for the traumatic events that followed ? At the age of to he was sent by his father to the House of Lords , to plead for the life of his minister Strafford ? a man Prince Charles knew and revered , Strafford was executed and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the age of 12 the prince was involved in battle ? the most bewildering form of battle to a boy , civil war . He left his father Forever at the age of not quite 14 , left England for Jersey and France when he was nearly 16 . Finally , when he was 18 , his father was , as Charles viewed it , cruelly murdered by the English revolutionaries , and there was not a thing the Prince of Wales , demanding , pleading , but moneyless and troopless , could do about it . So at 18 , Charles II was , as a contemporary put it , " King in nothing but the name . " From this point on , things got worse . For the next 11 years the new King Charles II was mainly in exile , always poor , always begging , always aware that he could not help those who depended on him , turning now to France , now to Spain , now to anyone who might assist him . His mother Henrietta Maria nagged at him . They quarreled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insulted him . When Charles did embark on a campaign with the aid of the Scots , the Scottish Presbyterians insulted his parents and made him pray to atone for their " bloodguiltiness " ? an appalling prospect . When the Scottish army was defeated at Worcester , thereafter the king wandered in perhaps the most famous escape story in history , a fugitive hunted by the very people he had been brought up to believe were his loyal subjects . And then it got worse ? worse and worse , more poverty , more humiliation until the totally unexpected wonder of the Restoration in 1660 which occurred , as all contemporaries said , out of the blue . As a young civil servant named Samuel Pepys wrote in one of the first entries in his diary : " Indeed it was past imagination both the greatness and the suddenness of it . " As I studied this period , first when I wrote about Cromwell and then concentrating on King Charles II , I began to realize that no man could emerge unmarked by these experiences . It was then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affable creaturewas greeted by those crowds on Restoration Day , May 20 , 1660 . Here was a man who had been betrayed , and never knew when it might happen again . King Charles 11 , then , feared revolution , because he had experienced it . What he could n't know was that he would die in his bed 25 years after this Restoration , the last absolute king of Great Britain . People argue about whether a biography can be written of a person to whom the writer is hostile . The answer is : yes , of course it can . Otherwise there would be no dispassionate biographies of characters like Adolf Hitler . Nevertheless , for me personally it would not be possible . I must Feel a kind of initial sympathy if I am to spend five years of my life on a given subject . Besides , in the kind of interpretative biography 1 aim to write , 1 think some kind of sympathy is positively important . After all , prejudice against people makes one a bad judge of them ? worse than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not in favor of someone , and do not try to get inside his or her skin , you may fail to create a coherent picture . Carlyle put this very well , 1 think , in his studies of Heroes and Hero-Worship when he reached the subject of Mohammed and wrote unabashedly : " I mean to say all the good of him I justly can . It is a way to get at his secret . " That 's it : getting at the secret is not achieved by hostility . Nevertheless I do not acquit Charles II of many moral failings both in my mind and , more important , in my book . I think his dreadful experiences dulled him , so that he was kind by nature , cynical by training . Yet a biography is not a series of moral judgments : it is essentially a recreation of one particular individual , set against the background of his age . Ah , there 's the rub . This to me is the real problem of the biographer 's art , the placing of the individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a man of his background , how much is he atypical ? Above all , a biography is not a history of the 17th century . In many ways Charles II was not at all typical of his time . Let us take three examples . I will begin with his tolerance . King Charles 11 was undeniably a very tolerant man . He wanted everyone to have his or her own religion . As the Declaration of Breda stated on the eve of the Restoration , he promised " a liberty to tender consciences . " He was , at first , as good as hisword , allowing the Jews officially to reenter Britain for the first time and attempting toleration for the Catholics , though in that he finally failed . All very delightful : but we must realize that what seems delightful to us was frightening and highly suspect in the king 's own time . People wondered : what was his game ? Was he giving away England to the foreign papists ? It can indeed be argued that this toleration was politically unwise , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our own values into our judgments on the past : they become warped . Take another example ? acceptance of secret subsidies from the French king . Here the position is reversed . We find this perfectly dreadful , as if the president of the United States were discovered taking bribes from Russia . How underhand , how corrupt , how dangerous ! Now here we have to realize that what the king did , reprehensible or not , was not in any way unusual . The Whig leaders were in fact being heavily bribed at the same time by Louis XIV , although all their public utterances were against monarchical absolutism . This discovery incidentally so upset the editor of their state papers in the 18th century , that he wrote : " I felt very near the same shock as if I had seen a son turn his back in the day of battle . " The third example is rather more beguiling . King Charles II had a sense of humor which we much appreciate today . You really could make up a book of the wit and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a short book , I can assure you . Perhaps the most famous example of his quick-wittedness occured when his crony Lord Rochester composed an impromtu rhyme about him . Rochester produced : To which the king relied urbanely that his words were his own but his deeds were his ministers ' . Then at the moment of the Restoration itself , on the day of the triumphal processions into London , the king remarked that it was obviously his own fault that he had been away from England so long , for since he had arrived in England he had met no one who did not passionately wish for his return . Finally , when the courtiers twitted him because his mistress Barbara Castlemaine had become a Catholic , King Charles replied that he never interfered with the souls of ladies , but only with their bodies , in so far as they were gracious enough to allow him . However , I must emphasize that this lovely kind of wit was not as popular then as it would be now : indeed one of his critics , Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became a prince ; there was a suggestion of It ; semaieste about these wisecracks , not quite what was expected of a king . Lastly let us take the question of Charles ll 's relations with women , He adored the company of women , their conversation , to have supper with them , chat with them , he was astonishingly faithful to his mistresses , even if he was faithful to several of them at once . It 's typical of him , I always think , that on the last active night of his life King Charles had supper with three of his mistresses , transformed into duchesses : Barbara Duchess of Cleveland , Louise Duchess of Portsmouth , and Hortense Duchesse de Mazarin . None of them was even remotely young by the standards of the time : in fact I worked it out that among them they had been in his service , if I may so term it , nearly 50 years . Yet once again this liking for women 's company was not a good quality in the eyes of King Charles 's contemporaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was a popular anecdote to illustrate this . In the late 1670s , the Accession Day of Queen Elizabeth I was increasingly celebrated , actually as a piece of Protestant propaganda . Somebody asked why such a fuss was made about the Accession Day of a Queen . The reply was : because she , being a woman , chose men for her counselors , a heavy hint that the opposite was taking place with King Charles II . I must end on a more personal note . While I was researching my book on King Charles , I asked myself which of all my subjects I would most like to have met : Mary , the fascinating queen , Cromwell , the great man , or King Charles . I decided without hesitation that for his humanity , his warmth , even for his inner melancholy , my choice would always be King Charles II .
