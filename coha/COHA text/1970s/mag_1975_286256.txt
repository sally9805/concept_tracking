When Chicago Plumber Eugene Quinn , 44 , was laid off from his $8-$10-an-hour construction job a year ago , he thought he could count on $98-a-week unemployment compensation , to which the Illinois Bureau of Employment Security said he was entitled . But for five months the IBES failed to send him so much as a dime . Since his wife Mary Anne 's earnings as a file clerk do not cover much more than food for the family of five , the Quinns ' electricity and phone bills went unpaid , and both services were cut off . Finally , on Aug. 8 , Quinn got checks for $1,938 of the $3,212 that the IBES owed him . Since then , there has been nothing-though Quinn makes weekly trips to the bureau to ask for his money . " All they tell me is to come back in seven to 14 days , " he says . <P> Unfortunately , Quinn is not alone in his anguish ; thousands of other jobless Illinoisans also have been kept waiting to get their benefit checks for inexcusably long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since the IBES has been no more efficient at keeping track of how far behind it is than at handing out the money . But in August only 46.8% of Illinois jobless got their first checks within 28 days of filing a claim-the standard laid down by the U.S. Department of Labor . By contrast , 80% of the jobless in New York and Ohio , and 88% in California , got their first checks on time . <P> Repossessed Cars . Each day some 40 to 50 desperate people telephone " Call for Action , " a national public-interest program broadcast in Chicago by radio station WIND , to complain that they are not getting **25;4984;TOOLONG checks to which they are entitled . Some tell stories of having cars repossessed or heat cut off ; others plead for aid in getting emergency food . Says Illinois Republican Senator Charles Percy : " It 's the biggest snafu I 've ever seen . " He calls the IBES " the Bureau of Employment Insecurity . " <P> A 240-page report issued by the Labor Department , and a later preliminary state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad performance mostly on poor management . The findings read like a horror story in bland bureaucratic prose : employees confused about their responsibilities and shifted from job to job so frequently that they never learned their jobs ; a near absence of planning ; managers unaware of how many staffers they could hire ; offices that were unclean and unsafe ; chronic shortages of supplies ; employees " indulging in frequent coffee breaks , extended lunch periods and early departures . " Worst of all , the state study found , the IBES was still using computer programs written twelve years ago for less complex machines than it now owns . Says John Day , an auditor for the state legislature : " The bureau is making a sophisticated computer behave like it was built in 1957. "
