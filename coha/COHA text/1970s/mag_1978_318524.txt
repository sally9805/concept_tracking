And maybe a new planet <P> It revolves around the sun at a mean distance of 5.9 billion km ( 3.7 billion miles ) once every 248 years . Even in powerful telescopes , it is visible only as a fleck of light . Pluto , the solar system 's ninth planet , was not discovered until 1930 , and little is yet known about it . Now astronomers have learned surprising new things about the faroff planet : it appears to have a moon , seems to be much smaller than previously estimated and may some day be stripped of its title as the outermost member of the sun 's family of planets . <P> While Astronomer James Christy was examining photographic plates of Pluto last June-taken with the U.S. Naval Observatory 's 155-cm ( 61-in. ) reflecting telescope at Flagstaff , Ariz. - he noticed an elongation in Pluto 's image . Checking back on photographs made in 1965 and 1970 , Christy found similar stretching , always in a north-south direction relative to the earth . After further measurements , Christy and his colleague , Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually a moon hi a 19,300-km ( 12,000-mile-high ) orbit around Pluto . The great distance from the earth had prevented astronomers from resolving the planet and its nearby moon into two separate specks of light . <P> Harrington reckons that the moon ( which Christy has tentatively named Charon after the mythological boatman who ferried the souls of the dead across the River Styx to the underworld ruled over by the god Pluto ) is about 800 km ( 500 miles ) in diameter . It lies in Pluto 's equatorial plane and circles the planet once every 6 days 9 hr. and 17 min. - an interval identical to Pluto 's own period of rotation . Hence , an observer on one side of Pluto would always see the moon in the same position in the sky . On the other side , it would never be visible . <P> Until the mid- ' 60s , Pluto was thought to be a planet with roughly earthlike dimensions . Not so , say the Naval Observatory astronomers . Using the presence of the moon and knowledge of its orbital characteristics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of the earth 's , its density perhaps less than one-third and , most significant , its mass only .2% . This means that their shrunken Pluto may not have enough gravitational pull to account for suspected irregularities , previously attributed to it , in the orbits of Uranus and Neptune , the seventh and eighth planets from the sun . Then what could be disturbing the two larger planets ? Perhaps , suggests Harrington , it is " a new massive object , possibly even a new planet . "
