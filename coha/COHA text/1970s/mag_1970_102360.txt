Where was the President last week when Martha Wilkinson really needed him ? Mr. Nixon , the sports fan , welcomed Ted Williams and Vince Lombardi to Washington , phoned Orville Moody after he won the 1969 U.S. Open , played host for a cocktail party for baseball 's All-Star teams , called Gil Hodges when the Mets won the World Series , personally crowned the University of Texas No. 1 in college football and also phoned congratulations to Hank Stram after the Kansas City Chiefs beat Minnesota in the Super Bowl . // But where was he when Miss Wilkinson  --  who lives and plays golf within a few miles of the President 's alma mater , Whittier College  --  was winning the U.S. Women 's Amateur golf championship at the Wee Burn Country Club in Darien , Conn. ? Martha is still waiting for the phone call . // Actually , Miss Wilkinson , 21 , lives in Anaheim , Calif. and works in nearby Fullerton , but most people think she is from Whittier because she plays golf at the California Country Club there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bastanchury  --  Martha 's best friend , who really is a resident of Whittier  --  " people come up to us and ask if we know the President personally . " They answer no. // Despite the silent telephones at Wee Burn last Saturday after Martha rallied for a 3-and-2 victory over Cynthia Hill of St. Petersburg , Fla. in the 36-hole final , Jane Bastanchury does not think the President will completely overlook Martha 's triumph . " Mr. Nixon sent me a very nice letter and a personalized golf ball a few weeks ago after I won the Women 's Western , " Jane said . " I 'm certain that he 'll send Martha a letter and a golf ball , too . " // Presidents aside , Miss Wilkinson was an overpowering player in the Amateur right from the start . She was medalist in the 36-hole qualifying test , with a two-over-par 150 , and then in 100 holes of match-play competition she never made anything worse than a 5 on her scorecard . Cracking off respectable 220-yard drives and incredibly accurate short irons , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally showed impeccable poise . // Her toughest match and closest call came in the first round against 17-year-old Nancy Hager of Dallas , probably the most eye-pleasing girl in the field . Nancy led 1 up after 16 holes , but Martha evened the match at 17 and won it with a birdie four on the long , uphill 18th . In the second round she squandered an early 3-up lead and had to win the 16th and 17th holes to eliminate Mrs. Pattie Boice . Martha beat Mrs. Dorothy Germain Porter , the 1949 amateur champion , in the third round , rallying from a disastrous three-down predicament after five holes . Then , in the semifinals , she shut out Shelley Hamlin , last year 's losing finalist , 5 and 4 , playing the required holes in two under par , her best string of holes all week . // By contrast , her competitor in the finals . Miss Hill , lived dangerously most of the week . She had to eagle the first hole of a sudden-death playoff just to qualify . Then she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against Mrs. Marcia Dolan . In the second round she caught fire briefly , and was two under par while routing Mary McKenna of Ireland , 6 and 5 . Then she faltered again in the quarter-finals , falling 3 down to Mrs. Richard J. Canney in the first three holes before shooting three birdies in five holes and taking a 1-up lead after nine . After all that she finally won the match by birdieing the 19th. // Her semifinal bout with Jane Bastanchury was , well , chaos . Two up after nine holes , Cindy suddenly lost four straight holes and was 2 down . Just as abruptly , she birdied the 14th and 15th holes to even the match , then won the 16th to go 1 up . At 18 she made a difficult 12-foot putt for another birdie  --  her third in five holes  --  and gained the finals 2 up . // The championship match was hardly one of those grim-lipped , no-love-lost affairs that most men 's contests turn out to be . Indeed , Martha , Cindy and Miss Bastanchury are all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been tournament-hopping around the country in a two-car caravan in which the order of formation is dictated by statutory imperatives . " Jane and I drive in the lead car , " Martha explained , " because the speedometer in Cindy 's car broke and she never knows how fast she 's going . " Before hitting upon this arrangement Cindy had brushed against the speed laws . " I was on my way to Tulsa , " she said , " and when I looked at my speedometer it read 64 mph , so I pulled out and passed this policeman . A minute later he hit his siren and waved me to the side of the road . ' Young lady , ' he said , ' I could n't believe you 'd pass me . You were going 80 . ' " Cindy put her best face forward and got off with a stern warning . // Martha , Cindy and Jane usually stay in the same motels and frequently dine together . Two weeks ago , during the Curtis Cup matches in Newton , Mass. , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was saying goodnight to Cindy and Martha , who were sharing a motel room , and when she opened the door to leave , the man from across the hall happened to be looking straight into their room . And , as Martha expressed it , " we were n't all dressed . " Five minutes after Miss Bastanchury left , the girls ' phone rang . It was the guy from across the hall , wondering if he might speak to the blonde in Room 314. // When they arrived in Darien four days before the Amateur , they decided to spend a day sightseeing in New York , doing the tourist bit on their first trip to the Big City . " We took a sightseeing bus around Manhattan , but the bus broke down and we had to push it to get it started . " // Jane drove Martha and Cindy to the course for their 36-hole championship match , and then the girls had breakfast together . Cindy  --  wearing her Budweiser flip-it hat , smoking cigarettes , chewing gum  --  birdied the 17th and 18th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lunch . But after an hour-and-a-half recess Martha surged back and won the first three holes to take a 2-up lead as Cindy experienced some trouble with her driver  --  hitting into a trap on No. 1 , pulling too far left on No. 2 and hooking out-of-bounds on No. 3 . Cindy won the fourth with a birdie two , however , and she seemed ready to even the match at the fifth . // Instead she made a poor approach , and Martha dropped a tricky putt for her par . That turned the match , as Martha then won the 7th hole to go 3 up and later birdied the 10th to take a 4-up lead . Martha closed out the championship at the 16th when Cindy , whose nickname is Ducky , hit an approach shot into the water . " Any time I 'm near the water , " Cindy said , " I hit the ball into it . That 's what a duck is supposed to do , is n't it ? " // Right . And a President is supposed to call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
