West Side Story , the 1957 Broadway musical about two warring teenage gangs , ends in a hopeful hymn to togetherness : " We 'll find a new way of forgiving , somewhere . " In the years following , that magical somewhere became in reality a sad nowhere of hard drugs and forgotten loyalties . Now , however , the gangs are back on the streets with a vengeance born of a decade of upheaval . The battleground is no longer Manhattan 's West Side but the Southeast Bronx , a predominantly Puerto Rican ghetto where more than 70 " cliques " or " organizations " have formed in the past year . The members - mostly dropouts , reformed junkies , displaced Viet Nam veterans-are older , angrier , better armed and more socially aware . Their avowed enemy is not a rival gang but society . " In essence , " says Benjamin Ward , deputy police commissioner for community affairs , " what the kids are saying is : ' Dammit , you 've failed us . And if you 're not responsible , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced the rumbles of the 1950s have , if anything , worsened . The population density of the Southeast Bronx-500,000 people crammed into 5 sq . mi. - is among the nation 's highest . Housing , health care , employment and education are woefully substandard . Fifty percent of the children under six have never been immunized against polio . Forty percent of the area 's families are on welfare . More than 10% of residents between 15 and 44 are heroin addicts . Says one of Mayor John Lindsay 's minority specialists : " The Puerto Rican experience in New York has been a total disaster . " <P> In the Southeast Bronx , the unrest has spawned gangs with such sinistersounding names as the Savage Skulls , Young Sinners , Savage Nomads , Mongols and Reapers . Each clique has from 20 to 50 members ruled by a president , vice president and warlord . Their " colors , " elaborate coats-of-arms stitched to the backs of their denim jackets , depict bloody skeletons and skulls , fire and lightning . Their arsenals include not only clubs , chains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rifles , shotguns and , say youth workers , hand grenades and machine guns . <P> Although centered in the Southeast Bronx , the gang subculture exists in Brooklyn , Queens and even Chinatown : pitched battles between immigrant Taiwanese and U.S.-born Chinese youths recently resulted in two homicides . In Castle Hill , a lower middle-class neighborhood in the East Bronx , teachers at Adlai Stevenson High School say that a gang of black girls called the Black Persuaders is one reason for a rash of student transfers . The Persuaders ' initiation rite requires the new member to beat up a white girl .
