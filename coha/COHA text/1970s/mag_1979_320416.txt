The Cambodian tragedy has also stirred a number of individual relief efforts . Two Irish partners , Wicklow County Farmer Tim Philips , 41 , and Dublin Sportswriter John O'Shea , 35 , recruited a five-man flight crew and this month took a four-engine cargo plane loaded with 26 tons of food and medical supplies worth $200,000 from Dublin to Bangkok , and then into Phnom-Penh . The Irish dairy and sugar industries , a supermarket chain and a tobacco company donated the supplies , and the Irish government provided $80,000 for flight costs . That mercy mission , as Philips told his brother-in-law , TIME Staff Writer David Aikman , afforded a rare glimpse of the grim reality inside Cambodia . <P> As their plane neared Phnom-Penh , Philips and O'Shea observed that there was practically no cultivated land . " I 've been flying light aircraft for a long time , " Philips said , " and I 've never seen a countryside more devoid of people . " There were few signs of life at Phnom-Penh 's airport ; landing instructions had come from Ho @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The plane was met by representatives of the International Red Cross and of UNICEF . At first it was not clear how the unloading was to be done . Then emerged a ragged line of Cambodian men , scarves around their heads , guarded by two soldiers . <P> They were desperately hungry . When a bag of sugar accidentally burst in the plane 's hold , the workers descended on the sugar from all sides , scooping it up into their pockets and even licking it directly off the floor . <P> Philips and O'Shea soon talked their way into a guided tour of Phnom-Penh . <P> Their driver was Cambodian , but one of the two escorting soldiers was Vietnamese . " The place seemed completely deserted and ruined , " Philips recalled . " There were a few people squatting on the sidewalks heating food or water in tin cans over a wood fire . Others , many in rags , were pecking about in the gutted interiors of houses . Everyone seemed to be completely aimless , moving with no sense of purpose . The only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <P> There were several soldiers ; Philips and O'Shea could not tell from their uniforms whether they were Vietnamese or from Heng Samrin 's Cambodian units . They showed their visitors the Independence Monument and seemed eager for them to have a look at Sihanouk 's palace . Later some of the plane 's crew approached a group of Cambodian soldiers . " How are things compared with a year ago ? " one was asked . <P> " Much better , " he replied . <P> " Is it good under the Vietnamese ? " <P> " No , but it 's better than it was . " <P> " What would you prefer ? " <P> " We would like to be free . The Vietnamese do n't care what happens to us . " <P> After his return to Bangkok , Philips spent a day at one of the huge refugee camps . " It was the nearest thing to Dachau I have ever seen , " he recalled .
