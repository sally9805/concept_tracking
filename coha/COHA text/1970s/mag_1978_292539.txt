QUARTET IN AUTUMN by Barbara Pym Dutton ; 218 pages ; $7.95 <P> Four faceless London clerks , nearly invisible even to their employers , share an office . So vague is their work that even they are not sure exactly what it is they do . Only one thing is certain : they are about to retire , a prelude to dispiriting old age . Barbara Pym , in her first novel in 16 years , indelibly sketches this Quartet in Autumn , whose lives , spent in bedsitting rooms or empty homes , are marked with small regrets and smaller pleasures . <P> Letty , occasionally wondering why romance has passed her by , is careful about her appearance , the kind of woman who " saves " her new tweed suit . Marcia is eccentric and suspicious . Although she hardly eats , she constantly adds to a large hoard of tinned food ; she mysteriously refers to an operation she had several years previously , little knowing that her mastectomy has become common knowledge . The two women are the first to leave , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luncheon by Norman and Edwin , their former officemates . <P> Into this quiet , ordinary situation Pym works the subtlest of nuances , endowing her characters with quiet dignity and endearing quirks . Norman is sarcastic , but he always stops just short of abrasion . Edwin , a large , docile widower , is so bland as to be almost invisible ; he fills his mouth with candies and his hours with a ceaseless round of churchgoing . <P> It is at the reunion that Pym unobtrusively begins to peel the layers from her characters . Arriving at the office , Letty notices that the two men have spread themselves out , occupying the space that once held all four . She experiences again " the feeling of nothingness ... as if she and Marcia had never existed . " But her attention quickly shifts . " Looking around the room , her eyes lighted on a spider plant which she had brought one day and not bothered to take away when she left . It had proliferated ; many little offshoots were now hanging down until they dangled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aside , only to return again , create the underlying rhythm of their days , until Marcia 's mental backslide brings a sharper focus . Pym charts the courses of these blameless lives , informing them with a wise , rueful compassion that is all too rare in contemporary fiction . <P> GOLDEN BATS AND PINK PIGEONS by Gerald Durrell Simon &; Schuster ; 190pages ; $9.95 <P> In the middle of the Indian Ocean , east of Madagascar , the island of Mauritius took several million years to develop animal forms that exist nowhere else in the world . But what nature can accomplish in eons , humanity can undo in millenniums , and that is exactly what the species Homo sapiens has done on Mauritius . By his own actions-and those of the animals he has introduced-man has already done away away the flightless black parrot , the giant Mauritian tortoise and the dodo , the huge bird whose very name has become synonymous with extinction . Now civilization threatens the rest of this island nation 's rare birds and mammals .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
