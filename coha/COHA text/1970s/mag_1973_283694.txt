He stood before the bench , fingering some notes that he had written on an envelope , still a tall , erect , impeccably tailored figure . But his face was gaunt , and the familiar baritone , once so sternly confident and self-righteous , was surprisingly soft . Last week Spiro Agnew appeared in a hushed and packed Annapolis , Md. , courtroom to fight what one of his attorneys called " professional decapitation ' ' - disbarment . <P> " Do not strip me of my means of livelihood , " pleaded Lawyer Agnew to the panel of three judges , his voice nearly breaking . " Do not impose upon me the ultimate sanction . I ask you instead to impose a reasonable period of suspension ... so that at some later day I might resume my practice and attempt to bring credit upon my state and upon my profession . " <P> The Maryland State Bar Association had voted without objection to seek Agnew 's disbarment after his resignation as Vice President and his decision not to contest the Government 's charges of evading federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week that the charge that Agnew did not deny was a felony involving " moral turpitude . " Agnew should be disbarred , argued Alfred L. Scanlan , an association lawyer , " out of respect for the courts , out of respect for the legal profession , out of need to protect the public and for the administration of justice . " <P> Friend in Need . Next week the judges are expected to make their recommendations on Agnew 's fate to the Maryland Court of Appeals , which will have the final say . Agnew has good reason to sweat out the verdict : he needs money desperately . His legal expenses so far amount to at least $200,000-and they will rise much higher if , as anticipated , the Internal Revenue Service presses him for the payment of back taxes . An " Agnew Defense Fund , " started by W. Clement Stone , the Chicago millionaire , so far has collected only about $40,000 . <P> To get by , Agnew will need more help than that from his friends . What friends ? " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sinatra . " Agnew and Sinatra dined with two other people at Chicago 's classy , brassy Pump Room a few weeks back ( total tab : $150 ) , and the aging crooner is asking members of his crowd to contribute to the cause . Sinatra is also acting as agent for the book that Agnew plans to write some day , and is said to be asking $500,000 . So far , no takers . <P> While Agnew 's future remains in doubt , he is preoccupied with his past . <P> Most days he leaves his heavily mortgaged $190,000 home in the Maryland suburbs and is driven in a Government-owned Lincoln by a Secret Service agent to a tan town house across Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House . There , with a staff of eight , he sorts the 400 cartons of his papers that cram the three floors of the narrow building and overflow into another house next door . <P> Agnew also writes hundreds of letters - many in longhand-to supporters who have deluged him with 37,000 pieces of mail since his world collapsed .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
