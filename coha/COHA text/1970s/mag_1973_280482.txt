An hour before the wet dawn of Nov. 4 , 1966 , the swollen Arno River sent cataracts of water sluicing through the narrow streets of Florence and deposited half a million tons of mud , silt , rotting butchers ' meat , excrement and sticky black fuel oil on the city 's stone and stucco . At that moment , the future of the city and its artistic heritage seemed uncertain . The water was everywhere-soaking into the fragile wood of old carvings and panel paintings , expanding its cells and cracking it , seeping up inside walls and working outward through the surface of their frescoes , causing bloom , mold growth and discoloration , flaking the surface of porous stone like puff pastry . <P> Florence was confronted with the worst problems in the history of art conservation . But technology , as World War II showed , is stimulated by disaster . Today the art Restoration Laboratories in Florence 's 16th century Fortezza da Basso have become the world 's proving ground for conservation methods-thanks , in large part , to the collaboration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The techniques used by the more than 60 restorers and artisans in the Fortezza make most earlier methods look antediluvian . Says Umberto Baldini , 50 , the dynamic head of the laboratories : " Once , restorers were like doctors who were trying to operate on a body without having done anatomical research . But the emergency of the flood made it obvious that art and science had to be brought closer together in a long-range program of research . " <P> Baldini 's allusion to medicine is more than casual . Even when the floodwaters had receded , hundreds of frescoed walls in Florence remained so damp that the paintings were threatened by a bacterial onslaught of molds and fungi . " If we had not found a solution , " says Baldini , " those frescoes would have been devoured by micro-organisms . " He and his colleagues ran through dozens of mold-killing antibiotics to test their effect on paint . Finally one was left : Squibb 's Nystatin , a stomach medicine , which did not harm the pigments . But it came in the form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall . At last the University of Florence 's chemistry department found a way to render powdered Nystatin soluble , and it was sprayed on the frescoes . <P> One spectacular result of this collaboration between art and science will be seen for the first time in seven years this summer . Like many other frescoes , Fra Angelico 's Crucifixion , in the chapter house of the cloisters of San Marco ( see color page ) , was suffering from a chronic problem that predated the flood : a pockmarked rash , resulting from crystallization within the plaster .
