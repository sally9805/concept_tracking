txt THERE REALLY IS a Santa Claus . Just ask apy of the ' Chicagoans who thought they would n't have any Christmas at all this year . There are thousands of them scattered around the city , devastated by poverty and illness . Most did n't Wive the money to buy enough food for their children , much less to think about a-fancy Christmas dinner . They all . need so many things  --  essentials such as blankets and winter coats and furniture  --  that frivolous Christma9 presents were out'of the question . So while most Chicagoans were having a great time buying presents and partying just before Christmas , these people had spent some depressing weeks , feeling forlorn and forgotten , forced into explanations of why Santa was n't going Cod-sued on page 4 , cal . I Neediest Families thank city 's Santos // to come this year . BUT SANTA surprised them all . Actually , thousands of Santos  --  or Santa 's ' helpers  --  were responsible . They sent clothes and food and toys and , of course , money  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Families Christmas-Fund . At least One hi every four Chicagoans receiving public aid  --  there are more than 700,000 of them  --  should receive a check from the fund by the new year . One suburbanite sent a $75 money order to pay a family 's gas bill  --  their service had been cut off because they had fallen behind in payments . Another man has provided a free , furnished apartment  --  forever  --  for a sick woman who takes care of her two young granddaughters . THE CHICAGO Lighthouse . for the Blind is going to make sure several children with eye problems get the necessary treatment . Several people invited families to share Christmas dinner at their suburban homes . Others brought Christmas trees , boxes of gaily wrapped presents , and packages of holiday foods to these families ' apartments .

Nancy , who two weeks ago said she could n't think of what she wanted for Christmas because she had no time to play , was bubbling over with excitement when she described her new coat and sweaters , the holiday ham and turkey , and  --  the toys and games she and her brethers have received . " Christmas is going to be a lot better than we thought , " she said . " My mother feels so happy that she just starts crying when people bring us stuff . You would n't believe all we 've been given . " EIGHT-YEAR-OLD Vincent Robinson had . just about given up hope of ever getting the artificial leg he 'd been waitColumn 1 ing for since last summer . Now , thanks to the Chicago Rehabilitation Institute , he 'll have his leg in just a few weeks . " He 's really beginning to believe in Santa Claus again , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when a story was published about Virginia Mincey , who was dying of cancer and could n't afford a telephone that would have enabled her to speak to her children in Kentucky . They all wanted to pay the telephone installation and service costs for the sick woman . Unfortunately , Mrs. Mincey died during the holiday season . But clothes , food , toys , and more than $500 poured in for this family .

" Eileen Enrich had been sleeping on the floor with her two children  --  she had been evicted from an apartment and although she eventually found another , she did n't have the money to get her furniture out of storage . Chicagoans sent Mrs. Eurich $350 in recent weeks . " She was so happy she was crying , " said a Salvation Army social worker . Mrs. Eurich and the others all still have troubled lives , beset by constant financial and medical problems . But Christmas is a time to forget and enjoy , at least for a little while . For these families , that was the best gift of all .
