txt An overwhelming majority of nuclear reactor inspectors feel that their bosses , Nuclear Regulatory Commission ( NRC ) officials , are not covering up safety issues . But there are a few who claim that the NRC is not giving proper consideration to matters . This is the result of a confidential Monitor survey of the 149 regional inspectors of the NRC . Fifty-four of the nuclear reactor inspectors responded by mail to questions on their views of how well the agency is doing its job . Charges of an NRC cover-up and mis- management were raised late last year by two NRC engineers , who resigned in a flurry of publicity . They claimed that they had raised important safety issues which were suppressed by NRC managers . This was followed by newspaper reports that a number of other NRC staffers privately agreed with those who resigned . // From page 1 *Inspectors on A - plant safety In the Monitor survey , all the respondents said that nuclear reactors as currently operated are " reasonably safe . " Several maintained that they are considerably safer than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When " asked " has the Nuclear Regulatory Commission , to your knowledge , covered up and brushed aside nuclear safety problems of far-reaching significance ? " 89 percent of those responding answered in the negative . Two respondents , however , indicated this had taken place , while two others replied that the survey had not asked the right questions . Typical of the majority of the responses is one which reads : " The management of NRC has been faiily responsive to safety issues . " A less-representative , more extreme reaction : " We spend too much time reacting to ' concerns ' that.have been brought to our attention by people that know nothing about reactors . These ' concerns ' are usually nothing , " was also a common reply . But one inspector said : " One should realize thAt individuals within the NRC are not dumb enough to bury a problem . They just study it to death . " Another considered the question " minor . " he wrote : " You should ask ' are nuclear reactors constructed to the requirements ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflect the reactors as built ? ' The answer is No . ' ' Does NRC inspect the work in progress ? ' The answer is ' no . ' " Yet another respondent suggested that the Monitor was " barking up the Instead , he said " you should concentrate on the conscious effort by NRC to erode the morale of its watchdog force , , the regional inspection and enforcement groups . " Erosion of the will to inspect ' of reactor inspectors means no safeguards , no matter how strong they appear on paper , will strengthen nuclear-plant safety , " he said . ? This same person charges that there is ark " old boy " system for staffing supervisory posi- ; ' . tions that fills them with classmates of NitC. directors in Washington and military officers retired from the Navy 's nuclear program . The group was also asked whether they were satisfied with the response of the NRC management to ' safety concerns which they had raised . The NRC has five regional inspection offices and it is the attitude of supervisors.at these offices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questioned by critics . Eighty percent of those responding professed satisfaction with how their higher-ups handled matters , although a significant number bewailed the slowness of the process , Fifteen percent claimed they have never had anything serious to report . " Bureaucratic paperwork is beginning to interfere with our inspection efforts and primary responsibilities , " one man objected . Another inspector claimed that the commis7 Sion management has consistently " diluted " the significance and proposed corrective actions which he has raised . Several of his colleagues , however , argue that the tendency of management is to overreact . From some of the answers to these questions , it is obvious that many reactor inspectors are completely committed to nuclear energy . For example , one questionaire - was returned with a single statement penned boldly in blue ink : " Nuclear power is this country 's only energy salvation . it is the amateurs who are running the program that make it dangerous , " The Director of NRC 's Inspection and En-ffmement Division , Ernst . Volgenau , had no immediate comment on the Monitor survey results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the other side , Greg Thomas a Washington representative of the Sierra Club , said " People ' in that field nuclear energy have a technologically optimistic bias . They make too much of the rather sterling safety record of nuclear energy . But this is mischievous because we are worried about extremely rare events which , if they happen , are extremely serious " A surprising number , when asked whether they had previously been employed in the nn-clear industry , replied in a way which implied that they consider themselves to be a part of the industry which they inspect . This could be due to a misunderstanding of the question . But if not , it supports the contention of one of the few dissident inspectors . Seventy-six percent of the survey 's respondents said they had worked in the nuclear industry . Four percent began with the AEC and then moved into the Nuclear Regulatory Commission . Thus , most of the nation 's nuclear reactor inspectors are content with the present state of affairs . But this does not resolve the question of whether this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an objective analysis of the situation ? despite the break-up of the Atomic Energy Commission two years ago that was intended to develop this very objectivity .
