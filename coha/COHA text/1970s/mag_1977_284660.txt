Charles Lindbergh was much taken with ecological and environmental issues in his later years , and all three of his surviving sons seem to have inherited his enthusiasm for nature , Jon , 44 , is an oceanographer in Seattle . Land , 40 , is , appropriately enough , a rancher in Montana , The most striking of the three , however , is Scott Lindbergh , 34 , a preserver of unusual species in an unusual place : <P> <P> The Dordogne Valley in southwest France is known for its richly forested hillsides , its spectacular rock formations , its prehistoric cave paintings and - perhaps most fondly - for its truffles and foie gras . It also happens to be the home of Peripherique , a six-pound black howler monkey and rogue male , whose treetop wanderings inspired local farmers to name him after the high-speed roadway that encircles Paris . Like all howl er monkeys , black or red , Peripherique has an amazingly overdeveloped set of vocal chords : his mere coo , echoing across the valley like the roar of a hungry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more astonishing is the fact that he roams the Dordogne at all . Peripherique 's proper habitat is the rain forests of the Amazon River valley half a world away . Yet he and 36 other delicate South American primates flourish in the Dordogne under the permissive care of Scott and Alika Lindbergh . <P> Dwindling Breeds . The youngest son of Charles Lindbergh , Scott has devoted the past eight years to studying monkeys and looking for ways to preserve dwindling breeds . Scott 's Belgian wife , Alika , a former movie actress and novelist , encouraged him to become a naturalist after they met in 1967 , when Scott was in his last year of philosophy studies at Cambridge University in England . With Alika , Scott studied animal psychology at the University of Strasbourg , and began turning his attention to a growing brood of rare monkeys that the two were collecting from friends who had tired of them as pets . In 1973 they bought a ramshackle 17th century manor house at Verlhiac , 100 miles northeast of Bordeaux , and turned it into a simian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sakis , titis , cotton-head tamarins and marmosets , as well as the howlers - live in somewhat better style than the Lindberghs , who keep only two of the manor 's ten drafty rooms heated . By contrast , their primate wards have roomy indoor cages painted pink ( the monkeys ' favorite color ) that are equipped with real tree branches to perch on , ultraviolet lights to ward off infection , radiators , circulating water , and hammocks for naps . Their diet is lavish . Scott calls it " saturation feeding " ; Alika , though promoting it , calls it gas-pillage - " sheer waste . " The animals are served such an abundance of fruits and vegetables that they eat only the choicest parts and toss away the rest - just as , the Lindberghs say , they would do in the jungle . Scott and Alika have found that many of the monkeys - normally vegetarian - turn omnivorous in captivity , needing meat to survive the colder weather and the drastically reduced range of foods in winter .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
