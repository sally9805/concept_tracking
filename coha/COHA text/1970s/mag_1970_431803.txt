 | I love doctors . They listen to most of the things I say to them , and they cure most of the ills I bring to them . I admire them because they know more than anyone can possibly know ; I worry about them because they work harder than anyone can possibly work ; and I suppose it sounds silly , but I do think they look so strong in their crisp white coats . I also hate doctors . They honeycomb their offices with little cubicles where I sit for hours , half-naked and magazineless ; and they employ receptionists who must be bred for this purpose in laboratory jars . They are far too niceynice on the outside , and icy-ice on the inside , to be real people . I am chilled by the recorded voice which sometimes answers a doctor 's phone ; I am frustrated to the point of madness by the difficulties of making appointments ; and I suppose it sounds silly , but I do think they look so smug in those silly white coats . I am not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctors . The truth is that not many people are , today , because a lot of things have changed in the medical world , and most of them are good ? but a few of them are very bad indeed . Way back in the old easygoing days when flu was just called " flu , " and preventive medicine consisted of tying a bag of herbs around your neck , there was a book called What To Do Till the Doctor Comes . I ca n't be sure the herbal tea it recommended actually would " loosen the phlegm " as promised , and it may have been that the mustardplaster recipe it offered would sear , rather than clear , any patient 's shrinking chest . But , regardless of what is inside the book , there was a whole world of healing comfort in the title on the outside , with the solid assurance it gave that the doctor , Himself , would indeed sooner or later come . Times change , of course . Nobody bothers with simple domestic flu any more ? we all insist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , through science , what herbs could not ward off through smell . And we no longer even expect the doctor to come to us . We feel , instead , a sense of almost childlike gratitude when we are allowed to go to him ! But , old times  | or new , whether the doctor drives his horse and buggy out to the farmhouse , or the patient drags himself out of bed and down to the office , the one ancient verity remains ? sick people need doctors . And it is right at that point that man 's modern methods come smack up against man 's ancient needs . Because surely it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a sick man , today , to enter into the presence of his doctor . I remember the afternoon last summer when I cut my hand on the bridle of a pony at a friend 's farm . A few days later I woke up with a stiff neck and an odd tightness in my jaw , though the cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show I was n't at all concerned , I glanced idly through our firstaid book , looking for " lockjaw " under ' L " ? and finding it under " T " for teta- nus . I knew it was silly to worry about a little symptom like tightening in the jaw . But under " Tetanus " the ' book said flatly : " The first sign of the disease is a sensation of tightness in the jaw . " At that , my mouth seemed to clamp shut more tightly . But my eyes unfortunately did not and I read on to learn that the disease , caused by any cut or scratch made by anything that has been in contact with an infected horse , is far from pleasant . So I went hurriedly to the phone to call our family doctor . The first sound I heard was his own , immensely reassuring , steady voice . " This is Dr. Browning .... " " Oh , Al , " I said , " I hate to bother you and it 's probably nothing , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . " Beneath the confiding tone of my voice a little tinny music seemed to be playing . I paused to let the line clear and heard the repeated message start again : " This is Dr. Browning . I am out of town and the office is closed . In case of real emergency call Dr. Power at .... " " Thank you , " I said foolishly , and hung up , already torn over the decision of whether or not this was a " real emergency . " I mean it must be a million to one chance that anyone would get lockjaw , for goodness sake . I shrugged and chuckled aloud to show how silly my fears were . But the easy " ha-ha " came out a strangled " herhherh . " I grabbed the phone again and dialed . " Watson , Strong , Power and Snerd . " It was a proclamation , not a greeting . " May I speak to Dr. Power please ? " " Are you a patient ? " The woman obviously did n't care how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urgently , who I was . " I was referred by Dr. Browning 's office . I have this cut and .... " " Dr. Power is on hospital rounds . He will not be available until two o'clock . " " Well-may I speak to one of the other .... " " Just a moment . .. . " And then she cut the telephone wire . At least that 's what it sounded like . I clutched the  | dead phone , trying again through stiffening jaws to laugh at my fears . When she came back she had the relaxed tone of a receptionist who has just enjoyed a pleasant coffee break . " Watson , Strong .... " " Yes . I wanted to talk to .... " " I told you " ? her words were individual pointed icicles ? " you will have to try calling after two . " Her emphasis on the word " try " was clear . It was then ten o'clock in the morning . I waited until two o'clock , slowly stiffening . At least I thought I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All I did know was I wanted a doctor . I called at 2:01 . The line was busy . It stayed busy . For a long , long time . Finally ... . " Watson , Strong . . . . " I interrupted her recital of the Holy Four and asked again to speak to the doctor . " Doctor 's ** At her words I felt burning panic explode into incoherent entreaty . " But - I-think- I-need-a- tetanus-shot - right-now **33;760;TOOLONG .... " " A shot ? " she said distantly . " Oh , you 'll have to call back later in the week . We do all our shots on Fridays . " " BUT BY FRIDAY I MAY BE .... Resolutely I clamped my jaw against any further outburst . It was awfully easy to clamp my jaw , and quite hard to unclamp it enough to say placatingly , " Please have the doctor call me when he 's free . " A slow-creeping hour later he called . He listened . He was comforting . He cared ! " Why do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at you , " he said . " I 'll put my nurse on . " Abruptly the sunshine warmth was gone and I heard again the deep freeze of my old enemy . " I 'll try to fit you in at 5:25 , " she said frostily . " You 'll probably have to wait . " I went . I waited . My spine , as I sat there , was rigid with indignation at what I had gone through to get there ; my knees were weak with worry at what had brought me there . And by the time I got into the doctor 's office I was a basket case . He , of course , was wonderful . He said there was probably nothing to worry about but he 'd give me the serum just to make sure , and he gave it to me . Then he leaned over to look at me with real concern . " You do n't look well at all . Have you been under any special tension recently ? " Oh , doctor ! I could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you now . I certainly had been under special tension . It 's kind of like a disease . It 's called " Trying To Call the Doctor , " and there 's an awful lot of it going around . It 's a tough disease for doctors to recognize or treat , but the simple fact , members of the medical profession , is that almost every patient you see today is much sicker by the time he gets to see you than he was when he first thought he needed your help . The truth is , sirs , that just getting to see you , these days , is enough to make anyone sick . And I 'm not just talking about emergency calls , either . It 's even worse when a well person , heeding the advice he hears about the desirability of " regular checkups , " tries to make an appointment for one of those . In our town , for example , the very words , " I 'd like a checkup , " makes some receptionists laugh out loud and makes all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great month-passing handfuls . Last fall my little daughter said she could n't see arithmetic problems on the blackboard without getting chalk dust on her nose , so I called our excellent eye doctor . " What seems to be the trouble ? " his nurse inquired . " Well , she ca n't see too well , and ... . " Oh ? you just want a checkup . I see . " There was a long page-flipping silence . She finally allowed that she had an opening on February 11 at 2:10 ? or , roughly , five months and four and a half days in the future . Of course a doctor , sitting snug inside his examining room , ca n't be aware of this , but the simple fact is that even this brief attempt at communication between my world and the medical world tied me in knots . It was n't only that I faced the practical difficulty of not being able to put that appointment down anywhere , since my engagement calendar , unlike the doctor 's , only goes to the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even though it 's a very small thing , all we ordinary people would really appreciate it if doctors would tell us how they get those several-year books so we could get them , too . ) The other thing that produced unhealthy tension in my mind was that " 2:10 " stuff . I mean I really think it 's time they know that we know that no- body 's fooling anybody with these little knife-edged time slots like 2:10 and 3:40 . No matter what they say , we know we 're dealing here with D.O.T. , or Doctor 's Office Time , and it has no connection at all with Eastern Standard . An appointment for 2:10 means we 'll probably get in sometime between 3:40 and suppertime . We know doctors ' schedules are unpredictable and we do n't really mind waiting , but I do think it 's time we told all those metronome ladies that they 're writing with water , not etching in brass , when they inscribe their little appointment cards . But the major failure in doctor/patient communication concerns the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their own waiting rooms that tell us to get regular checkups , or do n't they ? Our local gynecologist , just as an example , is an efficient and fast-stepping fellow who does all he needs to do to check my female health in , oh , roughly , three and a quarter minutes . I called last June and was awarded a niche in his schedule for early in October . Now what I want to know is ? Is that really the first three and a quarter minutes he has free ? Or is he and our dentist , who schedules a seven-month time lag , and the internist , who will give you a physical two and a half months after you ask for it ? are they all trying to tell us they would rather we would n't come around until we 're really sick ? There are areas of the world , I 've heard , where you pay the doctor to keep you well and stop paying if you get sick . Maybe a scheme like that would appeal to our doctors here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would then be a lot easier to come by . But no matter what minor frustrations , exasperations and tensions we all suffer before we actually gain the healing presence of the doctor , we all are humbly grateful for the dedication and concentrated effort they extend to us . As I said , I love doctors . They listen to the things I say to them ? when they have time ; they cure the ills I bring to them ? when I finally get to see them ; they know more than they usually need to know ; and they work harder than they actually should be allowed to work . But the time has come when all of us should bare our breasts ( only speaking figuratively , of course ; we 're still not out of the waiting rooms ! ) and tell the real story to the AMA , the College of Physicians and Surgeons , and anyone else who is concerned with the science and practice of medicine . The fact is , ladies and gentlemen of the medical profession , the science of medicine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things we have n't yet found out how to catch ? but the practice of medicine is fading fast , which is why your patients may seem a little irrational , once in a while . We love you for all the marvelous things you do , and we know we simply could not live without you . But we do wonder , sometimes , when your phone does n't answer and your appointment book is filled , if we are going to live long enough to get to you .
