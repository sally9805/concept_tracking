1978 ' s hits ( and flops ) were full of surprises <P> In the ' 30s , when times were tough , movie audiences lined up for screwball comedies , wonderful bits of fluff like Bringing Up Baby with Katie Hepburn and The Awful Truth with Irene Dunne . In 1978 , a year of falling dollars and rising prices , audiences often made similar choices . Thought was out . Thrills and chills and , most of all , sheer fun were in . Films that did well were ones that packed an old-fashioned entertainment wallop .

" Whether it 's laughter or screams , anything that gets the adrenaline going gets people into the theater . We are in an era when people are looking for a jolt .

Smoke 's budget was $1 million , but it has already grossed 38 times that . <P> The jolts did not have to bring belly laughs . As always , people liked to be scared . Probably the biggest hit of the fall was Midnight Express , the hyped-up story of an American college boy 's escape from a Turkish jail . Without any visible means of box-office support , i.e. , genuine stars , or even a few recognizable players , Express has already made $52 million .
