In 1971 , when Lewis and Ruth Goldfarb wanted to buy a new $54,500 house in a development in Fairfax County , Va. , they needed to have a title search done by a lawyer . Since the title had been searched less than a year before by the developer , the new check involved no more than a few hours of work , but every lawyer who replied to the Goldfarbs ' inquiries ( 20 in all ) said the job would cost more than $500-based on the minimum rate fixed by the local bar 's fee schedule . Goldfarb decided to sue . Last week the Supreme Court agreed with him that the title-search fee schedule was " a classic illustration of price fixing . " <P> Brushing aside the Fairfax County bar 's contention that its price list was merely advisory , Chief Justice Warren Burger found that " the fee schedule was enforced through the prospect of professional discipline from the state bar . A naked agreement was clearly shown , and the effect on prices is plain . " Such naked agreements were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some kind of minimum fee schedule covering legal services . But in recent years the number has dropped to 18 , as lawyers began to worry that they might indeed be subject to antitrust laws . The traditional theory was that antitrust regulation did not cover the " learned professions . " If that were so , said Burger last week , " lawyers would be able to adopt anticompetitive practices with impunity . " Conceding that some " forms of competition usual in the business world may be demoralizing to the ethical standards of a profession , " Burger nonetheless held that where title searches and the like are concerned , " the exchange of such a service for money is ' commerce ' in the most common usage of that word . " <P> Vain Effort . The court 's unanimous decision did not specifically apply to all legal fees , much less to fees charged in other professions ; but the implications are strong . " The decision shows that all professions are subject to the antitrust laws , " exulted Alan Morrison , a director of Ralph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case . " Doctors , lawyers , accountants , engineers-all must now recognize that when they do business in the community , they 'll be looked on as businessmen . It means lower prices and more competition . " Indeed in Virginia , in a vain effort to head off the court 's decision , the county bar dropped its schedule last winter , and the average title-search fee paid to lawyers has already fallen by about one-third .
