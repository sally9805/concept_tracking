 | LIVING OR DEAD , every city has a unique character , I believe ? an essence distinctly its own . But when I first saw the capital of ancient Chimor in 1967 , I felt pangs of doubt . Here , on the coastal desert of northern Peru , stood the fabulously wealthy center of a kingdom that had vied with the mighty Inca empire . But how could one hope to recapture , in this dun-colored sprawl of mud-brick ruins , the urban personality of Chan Chan ? It was simply too big . Covering roughly nine square miles , it was the largest preColumbian city in South America . I wandered past great desiccated earthen walls , some 25 feet high and nearly 2,000 feet long , . They surrounded baffling mazes of corridors . courts , and rooms , shrouded for five centuries in sand and dust . If there was an order , a plan , to Chan Char. from my lizard's-eye vantage point I certair. could not see it .  | . e answer came about a year later , at Peabody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : ement over a set of aerial photographs .. it had been made in the 1920's. - Look , " said Carol . " You can see repetitive terns here . There are nine of these huge led compounds right in the center of the r . Each is generally rectangular , and most m to have three distinct sections . " In the compounds we could pick out the  | same types of symetrically arranged rooms . halls , plazas , and platform mounds . Other architectural features repeated themselves many times . " This city did n't grow haphazardly , " I agreed . " Its builders followed very specific plans and rules . " " So ? we can break it down and analyze it in modular units , " Carol reasoned . " If we study one or two examples of each type of building , we can interpret similar ones . If we do this for enough patterns , we 'll be pretty close to understanding the urban personality of Chan Chan . " I was convinced . The National Geographic Society was receptive to our plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support from these institutions , we launched major field operations at Chan Chan in 196 - with a staff of a dozen U. S. and foreign scholars and students . Early Menu Offered Mastodon We set up headquarters in a rented twostory home on the outskirts of Trujillo , several miles from the ruins . And over the past four years our team has mapped , probed , and explored not only Chan Chan , but also scores of others among the more than 2,000 archeological sites scattered through the surrounding Moche Valley , from Pacific surf to Andean foothills . In search of the city 's roots , we have traced its inhabitants ' ancestors as far back as shadowy hunters who feasted on a mast , .. don carcass some 10,000 years ago . We were hardly pioneers . The irony of Chan Chan is that for five centuries it has been too well known . Built between the 13th and 15th centuries A.D. , the city reigned as seat of the Chimor dominion that eventually stretched some 600 miles along the Pacific coast .

When Pizarro 's conquistadors reached Chan Chan some 65 years later , it was partially abandoned , yet still rich .

And ever since , huaqueros grave robbers ? have dug for treasure , hea ing wreckage upon ruin . Yet the lonely , ravaged city survives huge adobe monument to one of the dri  | alfalfa now grows over the plowed-up ruins . We had to make do with information from the aerial photographs . As the mapping proceeded , we could readily see more and more repetitive patterns . A number of large rectangular pits ? more than 125 of them throughout the city ? caught our immediate attention . Earlier visitors had pondered them , too , identifying them variously as sunken granaries , reservoirs , and clay quarries for making adobe brick . We chose one of the smaller depressions and put a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncovered traces of a clay ramp ? evidence that people once moved in and out of the pit . Had it been submerged , the ramp would have dissolved ; thus the old excavation could not have been a reservoir . Then we found cobblestones lining the ancient walls . This ruled out the idea of a clay quarry . My Peruvian foreman , Andres Castillo , observed that the soil was growing more moist as we dug , and demolished the granary theory . " It is too damp , " he said . " The corn and beans , they would spoil very fast . " The Final Clue : Shattered Jars At last , one afternoon a workman shouted excitedly from the soft shadows 30 feet below : " Hay ceramica ! " Carol and I scrambled down the ladder to the excavation floor . Dozens , then hundreds , of shards ? undisturbed for centuries ? came to light as we brushed away the sand . " Water jars , " Carol said , and the evidence fell into place . The clay ramp ended about a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cobblestone walls were stained white with calcium carbonate , deposited by evaporating water . Now the jars had appeared . We were standing in the bottom of a huge walk-in well ? the first of its type ever excavated in coastal Peru . One of my staff workers , Kent Day , examined other depressions and found the pattern repeated throughout Chan Chan . " The same ramp sections , traces of cobblestone wall , and shards from large jars , " he reported . These wells supplied the city with water as long as irrigation kept the water table at high level . The wells went dry when the canals , and Chan Chan itself , were abandoned . The people of Chimor , unfortunately , left no written language . What little we know of them comes indirectly through their Inca conquerors , who borrowed heavily from their culture , from artifacts , and from legends 321  | preserved by several early Spanish c iclers . One anonymous fragment lists rulers of Chimor and tells of the dom 's founder , Taycanamo , who c ashore on a log @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to govern land . .. from across the sea . " Taycanamo 's successors expanded kingdom northward along the coa. : ; the Gulf of Guayaquil , and south nearly to Lima . From Chan Chan ruled with , apparently , a harsh Thievery , for example , was a capital fense ; those disrespectful to shrine . buried alive ; adulterers were flung cliffs . Herb doctors enjoyed high pri i but one who bungled and lost a p  | morning I found John sitting at the edge of his excavation looking happy , if tired . " I know what we 've got now , " he said with a grin . But it cost me a lot of sleep ! " He had gone to an all-night fiesta with Zacharias , one of his workmen , who lived in a large barrio an urban shantytown on the outskirts of Trujillo . Between numerous rounds of corn beer and rum , John explained , he had a chance to examine some of the barrio houses . " Many of them are built of cane and reed , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the windward side , the people often stack a low row of bricks or stones to anchor the walls . " At ancient Chan Chan the pattern was the  | same : The incomplete stone-and-adobe foundations generally faced the prevailing coastal winds . The cane-and-reed walls had long since vanished ? re-used , or perhaps burned as firewood in this fuel-scarce region . Much of the city 's general populace , we were now convinced , lived in these tiny , tightly packed quarters on the west flank of the civic center . With an estimated 10,000 such living rooms , Chan Chan may have had a peak population of some 50,000 . To learn more of how these prehistoric barrio dwellers fed themselves and made a living , John selected a black-looking midden and put his crew to work sifting the refuse through a window screen . From desiccated seeds and other fragments of food , we could soon read a virtual daily menu of the people of Chimor : corn , squash , sweet potatoes , lima beans , chili peppers . Desert Folk Still Look to the Sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domesticated guinea pigs showed up in the screens ? a delicacy still offered by modern Trujillo 's restaurants . The ancient people of Chimor also relied heavily on the sea , as do their descendants . In the jumbled barrio we found copper hooks , fragments of fishnet , and gourd floats . In one room John discovered tufts of raw cotton , dozens of pieces of thread , and several copper needles . Nearby he turned up a number of spindle whorls , some of them still unfinished . In another room a pile of copper slag came to light , along with several metalworking tools of stone and a tiny oven . " There was plenty of manufacturing here , " John observed , " but apparently not on a large scale . It seems to be more on the order of cottage industries . " The barrio , we concluded , was the seat of small-scale production , occupied not only by farmers , fishermen , and laborers , but also by skilled artisans who furnished the diverse services and craftwork demanded by a city of this magnitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chan , we searched out ancient rural communities whose inhabitants contributed to the city 's maintenance . At a seaside village beyond the northern margin of the Moche Valley , archeologist Richard Keatinge found sunken gardens where fishermen probably harvested the reeds used to make their fragile boats . We sifted for food National Geographic , March 197 ?  | remains at several farming villages along one of the old roads leading to Chan Chan . Deep within the Moche Valley , Richard and I located and mapped a rural administrative center from which the bureaucrats of Chimor supervised the construction of the canals and the flow and distribution of their waters . While surveying ancient settlements in the steep foothills one afternoon , I joined European-trained specialists Paul Ossa and Claude Chauchat in digging beneath a huge rock overhang . We had unearthed a lance point and a few stone flakes ? obviously the work of early hunters ? when an uneasy sensation jolted me . " Let 's get out of here ! " I shouted . The others needed no urging ; they had felt it too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the slope behind us as the earth shook and rumbled . Even on the relative safety of the plain we found it difficult to stand . The noise was incredible . The initial shocks continued for perhaps three minutes , and great towers of dust rose thousands of feet . When the earthquake subsided , I retrieved my motorcycle ? flung over on its side ? and headed for Trujillo , with Paul and Claude following in their jeep . We wove around broad cracks in the road , passing scores of collapsed houses in outlying villages . Our staff was safe and our headquarterslaboratory stood intact , but the colonial center of Trujillo lay in shambles . It was days before we learned the full devastation of the great quake of May 31 , 1970 : more than 60,000 Peruvians killed ; scores of towns and villages wiped out . The antiquities of the Moche Valley fared better . Most heavily damaged was the Huaca del Sol ? the Pyramid of the Sun ? a massive River of life to Chan Chan , the Chicama-Moche Canal today is only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north of the ancient city . The conduit funneled water 50 miles southward from the Chicama River to irrigate Chan Chan farmland . Seepage from the fields kept the water table high and city wells full . Aided by a separate National Geographic Society grant , workers under the direction of Dr. James S. kus , assistant professor of geography at California State University , Fresno , excavate the aqueduct across Quebrada del Oso ? Gully of the Bear ? where the canal spanned a dry wash more than 900 feet wide . Though the desert coast of northern Peru receives less than an inch of rain a year , rivers coursing from the Andes bring a reliable flow of water to modern farmers , who use portions of the Chimu canal system in the Moche Valley .

Aside from a limited area that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all . The great led compounds stood silent and brooding they had for centuries , disturbed only by reckless hand of man . mpounds Spacious , But Few Could Enter It was these compounds we would have to derstand before we could hope to comprend the urban personality of Chan Chan . What function had the vast structures rued ? In the late 1700 's a Spanish cleric , iAop Martinez de Companon , concluded t they had been palaces . Other scholars beved them to be commercial wards , or quarrs for various craft guilds . Early in our mapping program we observed something odd about the compounds . Each had but one or two narrow entrances . Interior doorways , similarly , could admit only one or two people at a time . Few hallways or corridors had entrances at each end ; doors were placed to keep pedestrians on a twisting , angular course . Clearly , although their walls enclosed hundreds of rooms , the great compounds were not designed to make movement easy for large numbers of people . If anything , they were meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this view , we found few wells inside the walls , whereas John Topic had turned up many in the crowded barrios . Almost certainly the huge compounds held relatively small numbers of residents . What , then , were the hundreds of rooms used for ? Many seemed to fall into distinct types ? the repetitive patterns Carol and I  | had noticed in the old aerial photographs . As a warm and windy summer set in , excavation began in the smallest of the great enclosures . Small courts , lined on three or four sides by rows of narrow buildings , occupied much of the area inside the high walls . Each building was subdivided by adobe walls ? three to five or more rooms in a row . Kent Day set to work with a crew to strip away centuries of accumulated soil . Each chamber had a single small opening facing the courtyard . Curiously , the doorways were raised two or three feet off the floor . " People did not live in these rooms , " allowed Juan , one of the workmen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he would trip and break his neck ! " Everyone agreed ? these were not living spaces . But what were they ? The narrow rows of rooms were situated deep within the compounds , in areas difficult to reach , suggesting that they had not been centers of activity . Storerooms , perhaps ? Kent and his men excavated room after room , but found each empty except for fallen mud bricks . Had they contained grain or food , there should be telltale traces : a broken jar , a few kernels of dried corn , even rodent droppings . But there was nothing . At last one day a broadly smiling Ker. : called me over to a partially cleared room " What do you think of this ? " he asked , an , : cut out a piece of floor with his trowel . I : seemed much like any other chunk of so ' : But as I turned the specimen , more here , " Kent said . " It lookas if a large bundle of cloth had been laid othe adobe floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removed , but the dried mud preserved the imprint . Audiencias Deepen the Mystery This was a stroke of luck . Prehistoric A : -. - dean peoples were master weavers ; the be of ancient Peru 's fabrics compare favorably craftsmanship with the finest textiles of meci : - eval Europe . And the artistic products of the : ! looms played an integral part in the system of tax and tribute among pre-Columbian states . Kent 's discovery implied that Chan Chan 's storerooms were built to hold fine textiles , and very likely other valuables as well It was not surprising , then , that the rooms had been stripped of their rich stores wh the compounds were vacated . Small U-shaped rooms , open at one en , " ?  | made up one of the most intriguing architectural patterns at Chan Chan . Each inside wall , about nine feet long , had two large deepset niches which , we speculated , may once have held ornamental objects or figures . We called these niched chambers audiencias , because they were reminiscent of scenes found on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seated in a little openfronted enclosure , seemingly conducting business or holding an audience with the people standing outside . The audiencias faced onto courtyards , and were strategically situated . It was all but impossible to reach the storeroom complexes and the compound interiors without passing one or more of the U-shaped rooms . Scraping away time-dried soil in many audiencias , we found intricate friezes sculptured deep into the clay plaster . Pelicans , gulls , and cormorants ; crabs , crustaceans , and starfish adorned the walls . Marine life formed the most prominent motif . The sea , known as Ni , reigned as an important deity in the Chimor pantheon . Worshipers cast sacrifices of white maize flour and red ocher into its waters , and prayed to Ni that the fish might be plentiful . The friezes imparted a hallowed aura to the audiencias . Further proof lay under the clay floors . Ulana Klymyshyn and Tony Andrews probed beneath several of the largest chambers , and found earth-stained bones of one or two adolescent girls , entombed in a seated position . In ancient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ensure the favor of the gods . Adorned by symbols of Ni , and consecrated by human sacrifice , the audiencias lay beyond the realm of the common man ; whoever occupied them was highly prominent ? perhaps even sacrosanct ? in Chimor society . We may never know the exact function of the audiencias . We can speculate that they played some role in controlling movement within the wealth-laden compounds . Perhaps they served , as well , as " offices , " from which the government and commerce of the kingdom were administered . Chimor Kings Born of Stars One evening after a sweltering day in the field , Carol and I sat in the laboratory mulling over what we had already learned about the great walled compounds of Chan Chan . She summed it up succinctly . " We 're dealing with a handful of people occupying elegant , spacious surroundings superior to anything else in the city . These elite quarters have a holy aura about them , overlying a basic concern with the storage of valuables . " These two key themes ? sacredness and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spanish account . Legend held the Chimor nobility to be the creation of two stars . Born of celestial bodies and descended from the mythical hero Taycanamo , the kings of the empire must have been regarded as divine . The matter of property appeared in the remarkable legal preoccupation with stealing ? both a capital crime and an odious religious offense . Quite likely the sovereigns of Chimor considered ownership their divine right . Slowly , the personality of Chan Chan was beginning to emerge . The towering compound walls epitomized Silver men five inches high carry a litter and burial pod past a funerary urn holding a cockatoo feather . Cocoonlike coffins , often shown in Chimu art , may have been the mode of burial for important persons . A tomb in the Chancay Valley , north of Lima , yielded this artifact to a probing huaquero. 335  | the city 's marked polarity , separating sacred fr dane , the rulers from the ruled . The walls kep lowed nobility ? and their divinely held wee within a cloistered world . One major architectural pattern in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loomed a huge adobe platform , several stories hi flat-topped mounds ? the most dominant of th ( buildings ? lay guarded by labyrinthine corri audiencia-controlled halls . Among these platforms , the scale of the destru appalling . Holes the size of bomb craters riddled ings ; several were completely cored . Obviously Spaniards had employed an army of laborers in the city of Chan Chan . The looting still continues , though on a mi At dusk huaqueros slip into the ruins , carrying c , light , and chewing coca to brace against the de They stay until dawn , poking and digging for gi buried riches . Intuition whispered that these great plunde form mounds had once been the tombs of king needed evidence . New Treasures From Ancient Chamber ! Two of our graduate students launched the inve Six-foot-plus Tom Pozorski towered over his ti Geoff Conrad , as they surveyed , mapped , and construction details of the mounds . At the foo platform , in a central chamber built against its f they found a small stone-lined trough , some fill ( white-and-red powder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mollusk Spondylus . Seashell dust . A Spanish chronicler tells us the inue of a king of Chimor included such functic the Blower of the Shell Trumpet ; Master of the I Throne ; Steward of the Face Paint ; and the Pr the Way ? who scattered seashell dust where his about to tread . Geoff and Tom began excavating the best-1 and next-to-smallest platform at Chan Chan ; th contained only 25 chambers . Although it had 1 sacked centuries earlier , the looters sought gold a discarding less-valuable materials in quantities an archeologist 's heart . As the excavation progressed , intricate fab colorful embroideries came to light in and about Lengths of finely woven cloth in rich designs thrown over the platform edge . Their motifs those we had found on the audiencia friezes ? n birds , and stylized human figures . Remains of ornate pottery lay everywhere ; deftly carved gourd bowls , small wooden objet beads , and fragments of ornaments crafted of cop and inlaid shell . Collecting merely these dregs great treasure , we were recovering far more  | 1 in three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ platform , we had e , - tier discovered the remains of many .. mas buried beneath the floor ? testimony t , the sacrifice of highly valued animals . From the audiencias , too , we had unearthed rificial victims . We fully expected to turn up further evidence of human sacrifice . We did ? on a scale that proved awesome . Probing just a few of the 25 cells yielded remains of some ninety bodies . Geoff spent more than a week in a single chamber , recording skeletons stacked like cordwood . By conservative estimate , 200 to 300 individuals had been entombed in the mound ? and this was among the smallest of its kind . Tom 's painstaking analysis of the bones bore out our belief that these were sacrificial victims . " There are no males here , " he said , " and no old people or children . We 've found nothing but females ? either adolescents or young women . " The remains showed no marks of violence . Probably the victims had been poisoned or garroted and interred deep within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farther through the grave robbers ' rubbish . A giant T-shaped tomb came to light . Occupying the central position in the platform , this was obviously the key sepulcher . Gone were both the body and contents of  | this pivotal crypt , looted long ago . But it was obvious now that the platform mound had been built to enshrine the occupant of the T-shaped tomb , who was then surrounded with the wealth and women needed to ensure a god-king regal status in the afterlife . The seashell dust , the buried riches , the massive human sacrifice , all pointed to the platform mound in each compound as the tomb of a Chimor king . Carol voiced a clinching argument : " The old legendary king-list states there were ten independent monarchs before the Inca conquered Chan Chan . But the first one , Taycanamo , was probably a mythical founding figure , just as Romulus was to Rome . That leaves only nine rulers who can be historically verified . How many burial platforms are there ? " There are nine . Epilogue Written Amid the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nine divine rulers of Chan Chan constructed his own compound to serve as palace , royal . coffer , and mausoleum . When he died , apparently no sacrifice of wealth or human life was too great to ensure his return to the celestial pantheon . His compound became a great and sacred shrine , tended by royal relatives and retainers . Meanwhile his chief heir ? the new lord of Chimor ? founded his own highwalled domain , repeating the cycle . Here . then , was the elusive essence we had sought so long to capture . Just as the nine great compounds dominate Chan Chan , so too did the great god-kings of Chimor bestow upon the city its unique urban personality . This was a place of sacredness , wealth , and military power centered upon each celestial king in his turn , that he might ? with blessings from the gods ? build . expand , and rule a desert empire . This was the spirit of Chan Chan . And yet in its dry , crumbling ruins we could read a curious , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the towering compounds was abandoned and Taycanamo 's heirs departed , the barrio dwellers moved into the once-forbidden sacred civic center , threw up their rude huts , and for a time even farmed in the silent sunlit plazas . Thus they transformed the regal personality of Chan Chan into that of the urban proletariat . Perhaps while god-kings seek immortality in opulent mausoleums , it is the common man who ultimately proves more durable .
