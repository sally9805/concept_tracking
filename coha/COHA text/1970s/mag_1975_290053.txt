Died . Michael Flanders , 53 , gruff-voiced English musical comedian best known for his long partnership with Schoolmate Donald Swann in their wacky At the Drop of a Hat revues ; of an apparent heart attack ; while vacationing in North Wales . Crippled by polio during World War II , the bulky , bearded Flanders performed from a wheelchair , while the spindly , cricketlike Swann hunched over his piano diffidently , squeaking multilingual ballads . Their routines were a confection of bluff nonsense ( " If God had meant us to fly , he 'd never have given us the railway " ) . Flanders and Swann entertained cabaret and theater audiences in Britain and elsewhere for twelve years with songs such as Mud , Mud , Glorious Mud and I 'm a Gnu , until the pair split in 1966 to pursue separate careers . <P> Died . Richard Conte , 59 , veteran Hollywood heavy ; of a heart attack ; in Los Angeles . An Italian barber 's son from the mean streets of Jersey City , Conte started out on Broadway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gangsters ( Cry of the City ) , grim-faced war heroes ( Purple Heart , Guadalcanal Diary ) and other macho roles ( including Susan Hayward 's sadistic husband in I 'll Cry Tomorrow ) . Although he struggled to break into romantic or comedy leads , Conte remained typecast in hard-guy roles , most recently as the tight-lipped Mafia chieftain Don Barzini in The Godfather . <P> Died . Larry Parks , 60 , journeyman film actor who became a celebrated casualty of McCarthy-era antiCommunism ; of a heart attack ; in Studio City , Calif . A B-movie player in the early 1940s , Parks ' fortunes rose sharply after his brilliant performance as Singer Al Jolson in the 1946 hit The Jolson Story , which earned Columbia Pictures more than $8 million and brought him several more starring roles . But his career was shattered in 1951 when he was subpoenaed by the House Un-American Activities Committee , which was investigating Communist influence in Hollywood . Parks became the first of dozens of actors , writers and directors to admit publicly to party associations , and was forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contract , other acting jobs grew scarce , and Parks was compelled to take up a new profession : selling real estate . - <P> Died . Clyde Tolson , 74 , J. Edgar Hoover 's almost inseparable No. 2 man at the FBI for 42 years ; of heart disease ; in Washington , D.C. A taciturn lifelong bachelor , Tolson joined the fledgling bureau in 1928 and soon became what Hoover called " my strong right arm . " Though his title was associate director ( he was responsible for administration and investigation activities ) , Tolson handled a pistol convincingly in many of the spectacular arrests that built the FBI 's G-man image in the 1930s . But mainly he was the director 's loyal alter ego : he shared J. Edgar 's bulletproof Cadillac , his meals , his afternoons at the race tracks , and inherited the bulk of his $551,500 estate when Hoover died at 77 in 1972.
