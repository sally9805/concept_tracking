It sounds like a sure-fizzle formula . <P> No sex , no excitement , and precious little for a white , middle-class audience to identify with . Just two blacks , father and son , running a junk shop in Los Angeles and playing a continual , if affectionate game of oneupmanship . Yet NBC 's Sanford and Son , which premiered in January , is already one of TV 's top ten shows . With so much seemingly going against it , what does Sanford have going for it ? Above all , it has Redd Foxx . <P> Foxx , at 49 the dean of black comedians , might have been preparing all his raffish life for the role of Junkman Fred Sanford . " He 's an old black dude , and he do n't take no stuff , " explains Foxx . " He 's a con artist . He thinks up elaborate , wily tricks , and I enjoy him . " Most of his tricks are directed against his son Lament ( Demond Wilson ) to keep him from marrying and leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would end up like her mother , " King Kong in bloomers . " He is constantly complaining about his nonexistent heart ailment . " What if I have a heart attack and have to call the doctor ? " he asks . " You know I ca n't dial the phone with my arthritis . " <P> Teasing Laughs . The show was created by Bud Yorkin and Norman Lear , the team that produced All in the Family , and like Family , Sanford is adapted from a successful BBC series . Foxx 's Sanford is at times a sort of black mirror image of Family 's bigoted Archie Bunker . When he spots a white nurse waiting to give him his chest <P> X ray , he announces , " I ai n't goin ' in there with that ugly old white woman . " A policeman asks him about a gang of thieves . " Were they colored ? " the cop inquires . " Yeah , " Sanford answers , adding-after the appropriate pause - " white . " <P> Foxx 's delivery of such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funnybone . With timing that would take an atomic clock to measure , he teases a laugh like a yo-yo on the end of a string . A figure of grizzled aplomb , he can get up from a spread of ham hocks and pinto beans , then strut through a junky living room as if he were Louis XIV in the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles . <P> The son of an electrician in St. Louis , Foxx ran away to New York when he was 17 , determined to break into show business . His first " club " was a street corner , where he played a washtub in a group named the Five Hip Cats . <P> Somewhere along the way he adopted his stage name , which was inspired by Baseball Great Jimmie Foxx and the red fox in children 's stories . His real name was Sanford , which Yorkin and Lear borrowed for the show . <P> Dirty Jokes . Eventually , Foxx worked up to the Chitlin ' Circuit , the trade name for the black clubs and music halls around the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other comics , he discovered the dirty joke . He recorded his first " party " album in 1956.
