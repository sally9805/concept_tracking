DEAR SIRS : Joseph ' Ruskay 's excellent " New Muzzle for Churchmen " The Nation , Oct. 2 on IRS harassment of religious bodies incurring the displeasure of the Admin  --  istration omitted two significant facts of the story : ( 1 ) Americans United for Separation of Church and State , though it carefully adhered to IRS guidelines for tax-exempt groups , had its exemptions removed in 1969 merely for taking a public position in defense of the Supreme Court 's interpretation of the First Amendment ; and ( 2 ) IRS has bothered the National Council of Churches and other groups while ignoring the quite extensive political efforts of the Roman Catholic Church to obtain government funding for parochial schools and to impose upon all citizens its particular views on birth control and abortion . It would seem that the Administration wishes to reward religious groups it likes and punish those which disagree with it . This is an " excessive entanglement " of govern  --  ment and religion of the sort the Supreme Court found unconstitutional in 1971 in Lemon v. Kurtzman .

As a long-time observer of West Africa , Guinea in particular , I feel this visit will be important to the liberation of Guinea from Portugal . At present , according to U.N . observers , two-thirds to three-fourths of Guinea is controlled by the PAIGC , and the Portuguese presence is reduced to armed fortresses around the cities . The Portuguese - are afraid to let- go of Guinea because they have their own domino theory , which is that if Guinea is liberated , then the other colonies ( Angola and Mozambique ) will soon follow .

Ravetz 's Scientific Knowledge and Its Social Problems by Mr. Theodore 4Roszak The Nation , Mar. 27 was brought to our attention long after publication . We noted that your reviewer deals in the first few paragraphs of the review with Albert Ein  --  stein and the work which he did for the U.S. Navy Depart  --  ment during World War II . Whatever contribution Einstein may have felt it his duty to make to the scientific research of the Navy during the war against Hitler  --  and we doubt that Mr. Roszak is in a position to evaluate it  --  we most strongly object to Mr. Roszak 's characterization of Einstein by saying that he " traveled the downward path from pure science to bomb physics in a swift , unbroken progression " ; that he " unique  --  ly embodies . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " the mushroom cloud gathers like a lurid nimbus about that saintly , sadly gentle face with which Einstein , too ironically , - was gifted . " Otto Nathan , Trustee The Estate of Albert Einstein The other day I received a letter from Maurice H. Stans , the President 's bagman , saying that CREEP is in " des  --  perate need " of funds and promising me a bronze 1972 Presidential Campaign Medal if I would kick in with $15 or more . The medal would be " a unique and priceless keepsake . " It would indeed  --  a reminder of the 1972 cam  --  paign in which an incumbent Republican President raised a war chest of $45 million which he refused to share with other Republican nominees . Herbert Klein has been quite explicit : " The number-one consideration is the Pres  --  idential race . " As to other Republican nominees , they are " a secondary consideration , but not a forgotten one . " These other nominees are being told that " the coattail effect " of a big win for Nixon will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicates that voters , by a 57 ? to-36 margin , feet that it is a good idea to have a Presi  --  dent of one party and a Congress of the other , and field reports indicate that the Democrats will retain control of both the House and Senate . But there is another side to the President 's coldhearted attitude toward his party and its nominees . The candidates about whose re-election he cares most are Democrats  --  specifically , Senators Eastland , Sparkman and McClellan . Gil Carmichael , the GOP nominee in Mississippi , is justly indignant at the way he has been ostracized . Even Agnew ignores him . In Alabama , Winton ( " Red " ) Blount has been given the bum 's rush by his " friend " in the White House , who fears that if Senator Sparkman should be defeated and the Democrats control the Senate , Senator Proxmire would become chairman of the Banking , Hous  --  ing and Urban Affairs Committee . In Texas , Senator Tower , " a short man in a tall state , " has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but an explicit endorsement has not been forthcoming ? Lyndon Johnson and John Connally would n't like it . Nixon 's Southern strategy involves him in situations in which he must , show a preference for certain Democrats and that in turn should help the Democrats retain control of the House and Senate . The prospect does not disturb the President ; on the Contrary , he is pleased by . it . " Our columnists , " Rep. Clar  --  ence Long ( D. , Md. ) explained to his colleagues on October 10 , are " claiming to be puzzled as to why Presi  --  dent Nixon is not fighting hard to get a Republican Con  --  congress . Why should he ? He gets what he wants from this one , We have a compliant Republican minority . We have an obliging chairman or two on the Democratic side . And the President has been able to outmaneuver us by arrang  --  ing a token veto now and then of a popular program . After shooting the works on handouts to corporations and corrupt foreign governments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as railroad retirement or the educa  --  tion bill , and he vetoes that , knowing that if we are going to do a responsible job , we have to overturn it . Then he can claim that Congress is overspending . Why should the President want a Republican Congress ? He is getting what he wants with this one and he , has the added advantage that he can blame it all on the DernoCrats . " The most recent illustration of the Nixon technique is his veto of the Water Pollution Control gill which was strongly recommended to him by William D. Ruckelshaus , his ap  --  pointee as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency . Congress has now overridden the veto and will be blamed for adding $24 billion to the budget , and Nixon , in one sly way or another , will claim credit for the measure with its proponents , as he did in the case of the railroad retirement measure . It was predictable that , sooner or later , the President would emerge from his various retreats and say a few words not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would the plague , but to the electorate . He could not resist the temptation to appear before the National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in South  --  east Asia , a splendid audience since its members have been supporting his policies . Kissinger had been scheduled to address the group but the President decided to sub  --  stitute for him . Whenever tension builds up in the Presi  --  dent , he becomes highly emotional and lashes out at the opposition as he did on this occasion . These outbursts are to be encouraged ; they reveal the real Nixon . On this occasion , encouraged by the response of his captive audi  --  ence , the President went on a 1962 California-style binge , denouncing opinion leaders , the media , presidents of uni  --  versities , professors , certain business leaders and , in brief , all those who did not agree with his decision last May to counter " the massive Communist invasion " of South Vietnam . Predictably he praised himself effusively , called attention to his " courage , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old Nixon . Let 's hope he makes more such appearances . CREEP has now been charged with large-scale political sabotage , as well as espionage . The most recent disclosures ? in Time and The Washington Post  --  have to do with what might be called " the Segretti connection . " The cast of characters is from fraternity rowat the University of Southern California and includes Ziegler , Chapin , Strachan ani Segretti . Out across the country , eight individuals have told The New York Times that Segretti attempted to recruit them for a variety of undercover activities . Time reports that Segretti was paid $35,000 for his work and that Justice Department files show the money origi  --  nated with CREEP and was funneled to Segretti by Herbert W. Kalmbach , who has often represented the President in his " private " affairs . The new sabotage charges are , if anything , more serious than the wiretapping and bugging that went on at Water  --  gate . They provide a vivid insight into what Martha Mitchell must have had in mind when she sounded off about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  tage can make a shambles of any political campaign ; there is almost no way to guard against it . Yet Administration spokesmen would have the public believe that most of these acts of sabotage were of the " awfully funny " frater  --  nity-row variety , a form of college humor , USC style . As a former staff member of the " college humor " magazine at USC , I resent the implickion . Our " humor " may have been pretty crude , but it was never venal . Segretti is said to have told one of the men he attempted to recruit that ? THE ritaloN/October 30 , 1972 " a lot of laughs " were involved in some of the antics being planned : Whoever it was who had $300 worth of liquor , a $50 floral arrangement , a truckload of cakes and 200 steaming pizza ; pies delivered to a Muskie fund-raising function at the Washington Hilton , all sent COD and none ordered by Muskie or his staff , must have thought that this was a screamingly funny caper . More significant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Administration 's response to them . For example , Ron Ziegler , " tense and emotional " like his boss when on the defensive , tried to brush them off as " hearsay " and " innuendo . " Clark MacGregor , who now directs CREEP , read a curt statement at a press conference and then brushed past reporters and newsmen , refusing to answer any questions . Neither Ziegler nor MacGregor made explicit denials of the charges ; they merely refused to discuss them . Kalmbach and Chapin were neither accessible nor loquacious . Obviously the Administration intends to maintain a stony silence and ride out the storm . The tactic has worked fairly well on the espionage charges ; the Watergate case has now been set down for trial on November 15 . In both the espionage and sabotage disclosures , all trails lead directly to the President 's top advisers and confidants and through them to him . Under the circumstances , as Tom Wicker has pointed out in The New York Times , " the spectacle of Richard Nixon piously pledging to ' halt the erosion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual accountability for individual action , ' is obscene . " CAREY MCWILLIAMS News Blackout The International Commission of Enquiry into U.S. Crimes in Indochina held its third session from October 10 to 16 in Copenhagen . It was major news all over Europe . In the United States , the subject of the enquiry , there was an almost total news blackout . Former Sen. Ernest Gruening , editorial associate of The Nation , him  --  self telephoned from Copenhagen to A. M. Rosenthal , managing editor of The New York Times , to request coverage . Mr. Gruening reports that he was told the Times would " consider " it . - When the commission learned that the American news media were carrying little or nothing about the enquiry , which was focused on American mass bombing , it de  --  cided to send a delegation to hold a press conference in New York . It was held on October 16 , the closing day of the enquiry in Copenhagen . The participants ' in  --  cluded a number of well-known American anti-war ac  --  tivists , among them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Anthony Russo , co-defendant with Daniel Ellsberg in the Pentagon Papers case . Rep. Herman Badillo was there and three foreigners : Derek Roebuck , an Australian law school dean ; Thich Thieu Chau , director of the Vietnam Overseas Buddhist Assn. , and Frode Jakobsen , a member of the Danish Parlia  --  ment and former delegate to the U.N. , who was a mem  --  ber of the commission 's investigating team in North Vietnam that included Ramsey Clark . A few journalists from major news organizations at  --  tended the conference , including a reporter from the Times . But the following day the paper carried neither a story on the conference nor on the closing of the com  --  mission 's enquiry in Copenhagen . One can understand that any responsible news organization would be wary of an ad hoc war crimes commission , but this one is headed by a world-recognized social scientist , Gunnar Myrdal , and includes two Nobel Prize laureates from the West and scores of well-known , reputable parliamen  --  tarians , scholars , lawyets and journalists , all but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the press conference an entirely proper question was asked of the panel : in effect , what procedures were followed at the Copenhagen enquiry to insure that it was fair ? Derek Roebuck replied that the procedures of a common law court were followed scrupulously and that he would stake his reputation as a lawyer on the fairness of the enquiry . As to what the commission learned , no one will be surprised : It heard witnesses from both halves of Viet  --  nam , from Cambodia and Laos , from the international team of investigators and from Americans who had served with U.S. forces in Indochina that the bombing was of such magnitude and so indiscriminate in its effect that it constituted nothing less than genocide . Also , dikes were being bombed when there were no conceivable military targets nearby . And Frode Jakobsen told the press con  --  ference that , while he was not sure he could agree with the North Vietnamese that American pilots deliberately chose hospitals as targets , he was convinced from his visit that they made no genuine attempt to avoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were removing the red crosses from hospital roofs . If the mass media had been doing their job , they would have passed on to the public the commission 's information that the RAND Corporation has quietly declassified some 60,000 pages of testimony ; based on interviews in South Vietnam . Available from the U.S. Department of Commerce , National Technical Informa  --  tion Service , Springfield , Va. , 22151 , this testimony , according to Mr. Russo , makes the kind of reading that President Nixon would not approve of , especially just before the election . RICHARD J. WALTON ' Blood Bath ' The Asian scholars at Cornell University who put together the report on the " Air War in Indochina " last year have come up with a new study destined to stir controversy , not so much in the Pentagon as in the Metternichian corners of the White House and State Department . Titled The Myth of the Bloodbath : North Vietnam 's Land Reform Reconsidered , it will be pub  --  lished later in the fall by Cornell 's International Rela  --  tions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the North Viet  --  namese liquidated opponents of their land reform pro  --  gram in the 1950s and will be bloodthirsty again unless the United States keeps up military pressure to gain favorable terms for the Thieu government  --  is a point of contention between President Nixon and Senator Mc ? Govern . Mr. Nixon turned theory into assertion at a news con ference during the summer when he said that " a minimum of 500,000 were murdered and assassinated " in North Vietnam and " at least another half-million died in slave labor camps " during " their so-called land reform " from 1954 to 1956 . Further , he said that " at least one million " were " marked for assassination " if a Communist government ruled South Vietnam . The Cornell study knocks down Mr. Nixon 's figures and predictions , which are so basic to the American posi  --  tion in the Paris negotiations as well as in explanations to the electorate here . The author of the study , D. Gareth Porter , has lived and worked in Vietnam and speaks Vietnamese and French . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vietnamese pub  --  lications as the Lao Dong party 's official organ , Nhan Dan ( The People ) , and Saigon and Washington state  --  ments and reports . Several of Cornell 's most distinguished Asian scholars ? Profs . Benedict Anderson ; George McT . Kahin and David Mozingo  --  provided expertise and back  --  ground for The Myth of the Bloodbath . These are the main findings and conclusions of the 59-page Cornell study : ? American presence in Vietnam has been justified by portraying Hanoi 's leaders as ideological fanatics who would execute former foes if allowed to gain power in the South . This is , based on allegations concerning North Vietnam 's land reform program from 1953 to 1956 , when supposedly hundreds of thousands of innocents were killed . The study says these claims are fiction be  --  cause they derive from propaganda , careless scholarship and avoidance of original documents . One individual in particular is accused of misusing evidence , twisting translations and selling the blood-bath theory ? Hoang Van Chi , a former North Vietnamese landlord who worked for the South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Central Intelligence Agency , the United States Information Agency , and now is a course chairman at the State Department 's Washing  --  ton Training Center ( in Virginia . $The portrayal of land reform as a plan to liquidate landlords misrepresents the policies of the Hanoi govern  --  ment . None of the allegations is supported by documents . Instead of mass terror and murder , the land reform program emerges as a planned , comparatively moderate social-economic transformation in response to real griev  --  ances and inequities in prerevolutionary Vietnamese so  --  ciety . Rather than indicating the deliberate killing of hundreds of thousands , the broader body of data evalu  --  ated in the study concludes that probably no more than 2,500 landlords were actually sentenced to death . " The 2,500 figure , even if closer to the truth , clothes no regime , capitalist or Communist , in moral rectitude , " says Professor Mozingo , director of the Cornell East Asia project . " But it is a far cry from the wild and extreme propaganda put forth by agencies in Saigon and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Ameri  --  can public an image of the North Vietnamese as ruth  --  less , doctrinaire men . . . . The ? myth is crucial ammuni  --  tion for the Nixon Administration 's rationale that Wash  --  ington 's terms for keeping the Thieu regime in power are the only reasonable , humane bases for settlement . " ? President Nixon has escalated his own rhetoric by multiplying the number of blood-bath deaths as re  --  quired to rationalize American policy . Th 1969 , he used journalist Bernard Fall 's figure of 50,000 deaths . In 1971 , he talked of 500,000 deaths . In 1972 , - 'he doubled it to 1 million ( adding 500,000 assassinations to 500,000 slave-labor camp deaths ) . The Cornell researchers found that the National Security Council was unable to explain how the President had arrived at his latest total . Neither the Administration nor the Cornell study can explain President Nixon 's projection of the million marked for assassination in ( South Vietnam . Obviously , it is -a guess that can not be supported or refuted . What is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the American election differences and Paris , talks . HERBERT MITGANG The Great Hacienda Mystery It has frequently been observed that Richard M. Nixon is an extraordinarily private man . But for the connota  --  tions , one might say secretive . At the same time , Mr. Nixon seems almost to invite inquiry into his more or less private affairs , in particular those involving money . Currently , we have the San Clemente puzzle , discussed by Wallace Turner ( The New York Times , October 15 ) in a long article that nevertheless raised more questions than it answered . As press and TV continually remind us , the incumbent President moves among three White Houses  --  the histori  --  cal one in Washington , the Florida or Southern White House , and the Western White House . In the first , like any other President , Mr. Nixon is only a tenant at the pleasure of the electorate . The other two he owns , al  --  though considerable government expense is involved in making them safe for him to occupy . Thus , at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than $60,000 in tax money to build a stucco wall around the land and to construct gazebos and a gate  --  house . The federal government also pays a gardener to maintain the grounds . In his May 12 , 1969 statement Mr. Nixon listed his real estate holdings as worth $365,400 , subject to liabil  --  ities of $25,500 . But that was before he took over the San Clemente property , on which he splurged to a greater extent than heretofore . Including land and buildings , it is a $1.4 million estate . In Mr. Nixon 's itemization of September 16 , 1972 , reflecting his net worth as of June 30 ; he valued his Florida and California holdings at $809,747 , subject to mortgages and trust deed obliga  --  tions of $518,038 . The discrepancy between the $1.4 million purchase price and the evidently much smaller figure cited by the President for his San Clemente holdings may be due to conftision about how much land he owns . On May 12 , 1969 , before the transaction was closed , John D. Ehrlich-man told reporters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 acres of the total 22 acres . Nobody seems willing to disclose what has happened in regard to the other 17 acres , which in a neighborhood like this , with ocean frontage , etc. , are certainly worth far more than the house and its encompassing 5 acres . The previous owners say they are " out of it " and Mr. Turner was told over the telephone that the status of the property was " other people 's business and not yours or anybody else 's . " That would be true if only private parties were involved , but since the President discloses his net worth , and the San Clemente property is part of that , it is very much a reporter 's business to find out who owns what . But all is confusion on that point . Current title to the whole property is vested in a " corporation deed of trust " filed by Title Insurance and Trust Company on July 15 , 1969 . This would indicate that the property has been put up as security for a loan . The loan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the borrower , and who the lender ? The role of the title insurance concern appears to be that of dummy owner . It is becoming ever more difficult to get Mr. Nixon and his numerous friends , colleagues and associates to level about anything . What is the purpose  --  particularly in this case ? Real estate transactions can not be indefinitely hidden . To use one of his favorite phrases , the President should make " perfectly clear " now  --  not after November 7 ? all the facts with respect to the ownership , control and operation of his Western White House . A couple of years ago the United States Information Agency issued a propaganda film intended to show the romance and heroism of Vice President Spiro Agnew . USIA films can be distributed only in foreign lands , which is a pity , for this film had a profound message , and the place to deliver it was here at home . Since most readers can not see the film ( only newsmen and politicians are permitted domestic screenings of USIA films ) , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , that USIA film makers , an extremely talented group of fellows when it comes to making silk purses out of sows ' ears , had worked more than a year and had spent an estimated $50,000 in an attempt to put ' together some  --  thing exciting : A covey of uniformed men is shown climbing aboard a big jet . We 'll see much , much more of that jet before we 're through . Whine of the jet . Voice off screen : " His father came to this country as an immigrant from Greece . His mother was born in this country . His name ? Spiro Agnew ! " Now we see Agnew coming off the plane and we get the title in big yellow letters : AGNEW ? Narrated by John Wayne . Wayne informs us that Agnew is on his way to visit eleven Asian nations on a 37,000-mile trip , " A journey of friendship . One man representing more than 200 million people . A journey across a world and back , but for Spiro Agnew it is all part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ' few short years has brought him from , a comparative stranger to the majority of his fellow countrymen to the man who now stands at the side of the President of the United States of America . " Agnew is shown telephoning in the plane 's cabin . Wayne : " Where does the journey of a man 's lifeprop  --  erly begin ? In his boyhood , in Maryland , his home state . Through the eyes of young Spiro Agnew it was a world in which imagination could become reality . All was possible . " A still photograph of young Agnew is flashed on screen , Then more shots of the plane , landing and taxiing . Agnew gets off plane , Filipino crowd cheers , somebody puts a lei around his neck . Scene moves to military grave  --  yard where Agnew places wreath on tomb . Crowd cheers . Wayne : " Never before has a Vice President played such an important part in foreign policy . " Another picture of the Vice Presidential plane with Agnew reviewing troops in background . Wayne says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign in this crowd spells it " Spero . " While Wayne recounts Agnew 's regard for civil rights and education , we see pictures of water buffaloes , then another shot of the plane . Into the new USIA color footage is spliced some old , brown , cracked film showing Agnew taking the oath of office as Goveinor of Maryland in 1966 . Then we are brought back to Asia to the sound of a gong and a picture of a Buddhist shrine . The Vice Presidential plane is in the background . Agnew climbs aboard again . Wayne makes an indirect allusion to the race riots of ; Agnew 's term as Governor , and of how Agnew had suppressed the black militants . Wayne : " The country knew of him now  --  a man who spoke his mind . . . In July of 1968 , the greatest challenge of all . " Scene inside GOP convention hall . Nixon and Agnew embracing , balloons falling from ceiling . Crowd cheers . Next scene , Agnew being sworn in as Vice President . Wayne : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Scene moves to Cape Kennedy blast-off site . Agnew puts on hard hat . Another picture of the V.P. plane , close up . Agnew steps inside the plane . Wayne : " Sometimes the voice of controversy , praised by some , denounced by others . But on one point there is agreement , he is still the man who speaks his mind . " Now we get a couple of rostrum shots as Agnew briefly scolds students and the pres . The airplane is in the back  --  ground again . Wayne : " Thirty-seven thousand miles . But most of the continuing journey remains . " Now the plane is right up next to the audience , overflowing the screen . Now it is on the ground , being wheeled quietly into a giant hangar .
