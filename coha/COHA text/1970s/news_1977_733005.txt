txt James P. Grant . president of the Overseas Development Council . sounds like a dreamer. lie talks of the eradication of the worst aspects of poverty on a worldwide basis by the end of the century . That goal , however , could become official policy of the United States and other important industrial countries . There is talk at high levels in Washington of major new initiatives to help the third world ? a sort of Marshall Plan for poor countries . President Carter and Secretary of State Cyrus R. Vance have already verbally approved the January suggestion of World Bank president Robert S. McNamara for a new independent commission to make recommendations on the economic relationships between the rich and poor nations . That commission , it is thought , could be ready to make its proposals for relieving world poverty by the end of this year . Formal appointment of the commission is being delayed until early . June . But it is understood that Willy Brandt . former chancellor of West Germany and current Chairman of the Social Democratic Party , has informally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of State Henry A. Kissinger and Sen. Hubert H.

Research by Mr. Grant 's council indicates that it would require relatively modest economics steps . The industrial countries , for instance , would have to step up their low- or no-interest foreign aid to 0.5 percent of total national output . Washington experts say the Carter administration is likely to be much more sympathetic to the plight of the third-world nations than the Ford administration . The new administration , for instance , now is willing to discuss with the third-world countries the question of stabilization of individual commodity prices and the possibility of later " pooling " the funds set aside for each commodity , so that one might borrow from the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an overall policy toward the third world . In a report to be released later this week , the Overseas Development Council will suggest that the administration has two options : ? It could essentially carry forward the existing policies , though with more energy and feeling for the third world . ? Or , it could " recognize the end of one era " and launch a series of major new initiatives " to make the world substantially better . " The council , a nonprofit research and public education body in Washington , would clearly prefer the more grandiose scheme . It is perhaps noteworthy that the author of the report , Roger D. Hansen , is temporarily working in the White House . Over the weekend , key officials of the major industrial countries met in Washington to prepare for the economic summit May 7 and 8 in London . Already , foreign participants noted , the United States has shown a determination to be more forthcoming in the North-South dialogue .
