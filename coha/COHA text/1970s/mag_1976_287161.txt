In the race for supremacy between the nation 's three leading banks , one is lagging badly . Last month , while the Bank of America and Citibank reported nearly 12% increases in earnings for the second quarter of the year as compared with the year-ago period , the Chase Manhattan reported a dismal 44.7% decrease in profits , to $30.1 million , v. $54.5 million for the second quarter of 1975 . The Chase remains a powerful financial institution , with $43.9 billion in assets . But clearly it has lost its front-running momentum . <P> Wall Street analysts had predicted that the Chase would show a decline . But the worse-than-expected results gave new life to a major topic of debate on the Street : What is wrong with the Chase ? To which a top analyst replies archly : " Two things : David Rockefeller . " <P> Name Trouble . The situation is more complex than that . When he first took over as president in the early ' 60s , Rockefeller greatly enhanced the bank 's image and developed into one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vigorous force in expanding the bank 's retail and commercial business . But now his name seems to magnify the Chase 's problems . A Rockefeller somehow should not be beset with the financial problems that affect ordinary bankers . Yet David Rockefeller is at least partly to blame for the bank 's problems . Since the bank has historically been known as the Rockefellers ' , David was destined for the top job ever since he joined the bank 's foreign department in 1946 . <P> His clear shot at the top had the effect of discouraging the kind of compulsive overachievers who were attracted to its rival Citibank . Under the leadership of the aggressive Walter Wriston , Citibank overtook the Chase in 1968 and is now challenging the Bank of America for the No. 1 spot . While Wriston has vigorously recruited executives from far afield to put new zip into banking , Rockefeller has fostered a clubby-his critics say complacent-atmosphere in the Chase 's upper echelons . <P> When Rockefeller took over as chairman from George Champion in 1969 , he inherited one big mistake-the Chase 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of America and Citibank were making major and highly profitable inroads . Rockefeller belatedly corrected that failing . But under his leadership , the Chase made other errors . Citibank set up a special data-processing operation with a team of industrial engineers to cope with the growing volume of checks and other paper . Chase , though it has computerized its operations , still has not completely solved its paperwork problems .
