To most beleaguered males , it would seem that the U.S. has enough demonic spokesmen for Women 's Lib without having to import them . But Germaine Greer , 32 , who arrives this week to publicize her new book The Female Eunuch ( McGraw-Hill ; $6.95 ) , has some outstanding credentials . A contributor to the European underground press and lecturer at the University of Warwick , she has a Cambridge Ph.D. , lean good looks , an unquenchable stream of bright , wild talk , much of it unprintable , experience on the telly , and a new proposal for the oppressed sex . <P> A six-foot-tall Australian , Greer is billed as the rare feminist who likes men . In fact , she seems obsessed by sex . Her marriage lasted only three weeks , but she speaks freely of her pleasure in being a sort of super-groupie , and the sort of woman who can tame violent men . Indeed , there are a few passages in her book that make her sound more like a Helen Gurley Brown than a Kate Millett @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you have joy and strength , you will never be lonely . ) <P> Affirm the Libido . Most of The Female Eunuch is a thorough exegesis of the tenets of Women 's Lib-exaggerated , unreasonable , but written with passion , wit and a bottomless supply of earthy words from centuries back. * Though Greer is erudite , her book is far less intellectual than Kate Millett 's Sexual Politics , with its long , scholarly analyses of Mailer , Lawrence , Miller and Genet . Greer is more interested in the popular press , which she combs for illustrations of her thesis . To her , woman has become a eunuch , a poor creature castrated and forced into passivity by men , who have somehow commandeered all the world 's energy . <P> Many American feminists assume that a woman 's libido must be denied if she wants to get on in the world . Quite the contrary , says Greer . What vitiates women 's energy is their suppression of their sexuality . Nor does Greer agree with the radical women who believe in giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , is the arena of confrontation in which new values must be hammered out . <P> Forget about Organs . Greer is also concerned about the " clitoromania " of some of her American sisters . Freud believed that in the psychosexually mature woman , the primary erogenous zone was the vagina , but Masters and Johnson found the clitoris equally important . Women 's Lib theoreticians were delighted , and Anne Koedt 's pamphlet called The Myth of the Vaginal Orgasm has become an important part of the liberation canon , bought today even by high school girls with inquiring minds . Greer takes bold issue with the notion of " the utter passivity and even irrelevance of the vagina . " It is time , she says , to put the clitoris in its place as only " a kind of sexual overdrive in a more general response . " More important , one should make love to people and not to organs .
