THE TALK . OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment OUT in Akron , Ohio , there is an underground church called Alice 's Restaurant , which figures in the most amiable story of the season just past . This group , led by unfrocked priests and unchurched ministers , was doing a deal of earnest good work in a quiet way , all to dramatize and protest the commerc ; alization of Christmas . At shopping centers , for instance , they passed out leaflets calling upon shoppers to limit individual gifts to two-fifty and to devote the overplus to the poor . Then it occurred to one underground churchman , David Bullock by name , to demonstrate the fate that would inevitably befall the Holy Family in a society of heartless abundance . " Joseph and Mary were poor people , " Mr. Bid-lock observed , and he proceeded to devise a scheme that would reveal " what would happen when a poor young couple dressed like Joseph and Mary tried to get a room nearly two thousand years after the birth of Christ . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bullock , in beard and robe , walked out of the cold and darkness of Akron into the lobby of the Downtown Holiday Inn , accompanied by a young woman and a donkey . " I need a room for the night , " be told the manager . " My wife is heavy with child . " He then filled nut the registration form , identifying himself as Joseph of Nazareth , travelling with his wife from Judea . Then he waited . The night manager , Mr. Robert Nagel , affabi ) observed that they had come a long way and handed over the key to Room 101 . ( Tahirim . ) We picture Mr. Bullock with the key in his hand , his rented donkey lurking behind him , and his faith in human nature crumbling to the ground . To crown his discomfiture , Mr. Nagel offered the wayfarers a free meal . But , alas , in an era of affluence , satiety , like the indiscriminate rain , is apt to desand upon the just and unjust alike . " We were n't very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I asked him if we could have some drinks . " Then he added , " And you know what ? He sent them around . " For his own part , Mr. Nag-el was under no illusions about the financial standing of his new guests . " I knew they could n't pay , " he said . " I mean , a donkey is not a normal form of transportation . " One would like to shake him by the hand . We thank Mr. Nagel for adding immeasurabl to the merriment of our Christmas , and fur h 's exhibition of that unpredictable , shrewd , and sometimes highly inconvenient human generosity that makes sweeping moral judgments so risky -- even for the most earnest of moralists  --  and makes life so rich ) interesting for the rest of us . Saga A r maw1-E is not an uncommon animal , " says young Jolyon Forte in John Galsworthy 's novel " The Man of Property . " According to young Jolyon ( the family rebel , who has recently been resuscitated , along with the rest of that cantankerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , the time Forsyte is any man who " knows a good thing .... His grip on property  --  it does n't matter whether it be wives , houses , money , or reputation  --  is his hallmark . " Galsworthy himself , a graduate of Harrow and New College , Oxford , and a non-practicing member of the bar , clearly knew a good thing when he saw it . " The Man of Property , " first published in London in 1906 , turned out to he the opening section of a trilogy called " The Forsyte Saga , " which , in turn , was revealed to be the opening section of a trilogy of trilogies known as the " Forsyte Chronicles . " Although these volumes made up but a small part of Gals-worthy 's enormous literary output  --  some twenty novels , more than twenty-five plays , innumerable short stories and essays , plus a " Collected Poems " ? it was the Forsytes who were largely responsible for the ever-widening chorus of critical acclaim that reached a crescendo in 1932 , when Galsworthy was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no true Forsyte ever put much faith in fancy-sounding titles . Far more impressive , in Forsytean terms , were the facts and figures showing that during his lifetime Galsworthy was one of the best-selling authors of the Western world . His American publishers , Charles Scribner 's Sons , for example , sold about a million Galsworthv volumes . The Nobel laureate 's literary reputation  --  and sales  --  suffered a disastrous decline shortly after his death , in 1933 . True , the basic Forst to hooks remained in print  --  even when , in recent years , annual sales fell as low as two thousand . And there were occasional flurries of renewed interest , as in 1949 , when Metro-GoldwynMa er brought out a movie entitled " That Forsyte Woman , " starring Greer Carson , which grossed a piafectly respectable three million eight hundred thousand dollars . Such windfalls , however , were in the nature of long-deferred dividends , rather than an index of the underlying health of the Galsworthy corpus . Then , in 1967 , the British Broadcasting Corporation decided to turn the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twentysix-chapter serial for literate adults , and before you could say " three-percent consols " the Forsyte business was booming again . All the facts and figures associated with the revival have a solid ring to them . The B.B.C. has admitted to production costs of two hundred and sixty thousand pounds ( approximately seven hundred thousand dollars ) , not counting royalties paid to M-G-M for the TV rights . The script contains three hundred thousand words of dialogue ; there are a hundred and twenty speaking parts , roughly a third of which can be considered major ; and the entire series , under the name of " The Forsyte Saga , " has already been seen , or is scheduled for broadcast , in forty-two countries , including the Soviet Union ( dubbed ) and the United States . In England itself , the serial attracted some seventeen million viewers , who gathered religiously around the telly each Sunday evening the word " re-ligiously " being unavoidable in this context , since the broadcasts overlapped the hour of the traditional evening service in English churches , and apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up between the Men of God and the Men of Media over who ought to be preempted by whom . Those Men of God who decided to stand on principle saw church attendance fall off drastically , which prompted some of their colleagues to take a more pragmatic view . Canon Ernest Corbel ' , of Diss , Norfolk , explained his reasons for rescheduling vespers in these words : " I am not saying that worship is less important than television , but there is no reason why we can not enjoy both . " Meanwhile , Galsworthy 's name was heard once more across the book counters of the nation , with nearly one and three -- quarter million volumes sold in the last three years . On this side of the Atlantic , the three major commercial networks turned down the opportunity to purchase " The Forsyte Saga , " presumably because they saw no profit in a literate situation drama set in Victorian and Edwardian England , and filmed in stylish but unostentatious black-and-white . As a result , National Educational Television , the non-profit public network , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a hundred and forty thousand dollars . On Sunday , October 5 , 1969 ( at 9 P.M. Eastern Time and Mountain Time , and 8 P.M. Central Time and Pacific Time ) , N.E.T . fed the first episode to its hundred and sixty-seven affiliated stations , ranging from IVNDT , Channel 13 , in New York , to KVZK , Channel 2 , in Page ) Pago , American Samoa . Audience response , while hardly on the British scale so far , has been impressive According to a spot survey commissioned by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting , which is helping to underwrite the costs of the broadcasts , Chapter 5 , " A Man of Property , " " captured " about three per cent of all television sets turned on in four major cities during its allotted time . This figure would hardly warrant a footnote in the regular Neilsen ratings , but for N.E.T. , which is accustomed to thinking of its prime-time audience in percentage points of a percentage point , it is considered a breakthrough . The fan mail , which has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that rarest of twentieth-century American phenomena , an over -- thirty cult . One octogenarian expressed his gratitude by saying , " It brings back many happy hours of my youth . " Another viewer suggested that a suitable followup might be a serial based on Thomas Mann 's " Buddenbrooks . " A lady in Vermilion , South Dakota , described her successful campaign to persuade her friends to join in her Sunday-night " vigils " : " I introduced them to the Forsytc.s with tea and sherry parties , and they 've shared my enthusiasm ever since . " And a correspondent in Millburn , New Jersey , sent to Channel 13 a subscription check with this comment : " ' The Forsyte Saga ' presentation makes the enclosed check imperative . What a wonderful thing to do for this country , particularly at this unsettled time . " The impact of all this raw sentiment on the book market here is just beginning to be felt . Scribners has dusted off its old Forsyte properties and expects to have three hundred thousand copies in print by the end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dollar ninety-five apiece , or in hard-cover at ten dollars per trilogy . Full royalties are being paid to the Galsworthy estate on all titles -- even on " The Man of Property , " which passed into the public domain in this country in 1966 . To no one 's surprise , midtown bookshops like Brentano 's , Wornrath , and Scribners ' own retail outlet are reporting unusually heavy demand , especially from middle-aged women , while campus stores like the Yale and Harvard Co-ops have found almost no interest among undergraduates . And , speaking a language that any Forsyte could understand , the night clerk at the East Side Book Store , on St. Mark 's Place  --  whose clientele has been snapping up Abbie Hoffman 's " Woodstock Nation " ? reports that , as far as he is concerned , Galsworth ) is " a stiff . " He has n't sold one copy in two months . Camaraderie ' A MAN we know was riding in a taxi down Lexington Avenue one icy night last week and noticed that his driver was a Young fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light , and our friend had just begun to think about the large number of young men with long hair he has lateh seen driving cabs around town when a car behind skidded into the rear of his cab . The young driver uttered the expected niceties , muttered something about " Waitil I get in hands , " and hopped swifth out of the cab , prepared for hattic . The skiddi car turned out to he another cab , operated b e young fellow with very long hair . The two drivers walked slowly toward each other , pale hirsute warriors in the cold light of a street lamp . The ) sized each other up for a brief moment , quietly shook hands , climbed back into their cabs , and drove off . Our friend is still pleased about the matter . Travel Plans THE American Geographical So- bet ) ' s annual dinner at the St. Regis-Sheraton Roof proceeded from the usual greetings of its president , Dr , Serge A. KorfE , through awards of honorary fellowships and medals to distinguished geographers , to on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , director of the Institute for Space Studies of NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center . The title of the talk was " The Apollo Missions , " but Dr. Jastrow went on from a discussion of the moon to a discussion of the live-in prospects on Mars ( quite promising ; colonies likely I , on Jupiter and Saturn ( prognosis poor ; their gravities would crush us ) , on Venus and Mercur ) ( ditto ; either too hot or too cold 1 , and , beyond the solar system , on the stars . " The bridge that separates us from the star ; is impassable , " be said , and rein/ rked : The closest star visible in the Northern Hemisphere , Barnard 's Star ... is thirty-six trillion miles away . If we could travel at the speed of light  --  a hundred and eighty-six thousand miles per second  --  we would need six years to reach it , and at today 's rocket speeds the trip would take a hundred thousand years . The nearest star to the sun  --  Alpha Centauri visible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closer . Most of the other one hundred billion stars in the Milky Way are hundreds or thousands of times more distant . To a space scientist , apparently , the word " impassable " does not mean " impossible . ' ' " Is there no wa ) in which we can reach these remote objectsP " Dr. Jastrow asked , and continued , " I can think of four wa s in which we can cross that gap . " For the first of these , he invoked something he called the matter-antimatter annihilator : We know from laborator3 experiments that antimatter and matter , brought into close contact , annihilate one another in a burst of energy containing the equivalent of their entire rest mass . This complete conversion of matter to energy satisfies the basic fuel requirement for interstellar travel . If copious quantities of antimatter can he manufactured on the earth and combined with matter at a controlled . steady rate , we will have a rocket engine capable of approaching the speed of light . This achievement is so far beyond the limits of nuclear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if not thousands , of years in the future . For the second , he adduced the deep freeze : If medical research conquers the problem of suspended animation for humans , space travellers may pass hundreds or thousands of years in frozen sleep , ageless , drifting through the cosmos in an automated spacecraft . When the craft approaches its destination , the travellers will he awakened by a computer . After completing their survey , they will head back to earth , steeping again until they are awakened to step out into a world bearing little resemblance to the one they left hundreds of centuries earlier . For the third , he adduced terminal germination : It may be possible to transport germ cells  --  sperm and ova  --  which could he combined in artificial wombs , under coin ? puter direction , as the craft entered the alien solar system toward the end of its journey , so that full-grown crew members would he ready to explore the new planet on arrival . Fur the fourth , lie conjured up the space ark : At the present rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years we should be able to build giant space arks , the size of the Queen Mary , which would be self-sustaining and able to maintain life for an indefinite period , replenishing their depleted energy supplies periodically by " fuel stops " at a succession of stars on the way to their destinations . These arks would be miniature earths , growing their own food and carrying with them the culture of the parent civilization . Generations would he horn , live , and die on the way to a distant star . The population of each ark mighr number some hundreds or thousands of men and women . Life would be tull for everyone , and each person would have a demanding task to perform in this micro-society . The survival of the ark would depend on qualities that are held in great esteem by society today . Emotional stability , tact , and a high level of cooperation would be well regarded in the confined world of the space ark " Would anyone he eager to accept such missions , knowing that he never would see the earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a resounding yes : Judging by the past , there is little doubt that people would . From the ancient Greeks to the American pioneers , the history of exploration has been in large measure a history of men who struck out on dangerous and arduous journeys to settle unknown worlds , with no expectation of ever returning to their homes . Stimulated by these prophecies , we struck nut , a few days later , on a journey to the Institute for Space Studies building , at 112th Street and Broadway . We found the director , who is a boyish-looking man in his middle forties , in a large room on the seventh floor containing a big blackboard covered with equations . " We 're the long-haired part of NASA , " he said . " We have a staff of a hundred and eighty mostly theoretical physicists . We work on the origin of the universe and the physics of the moon , but our more immediate , bread-and-butter work relates to weather forecasting finding the causes of weather disturbances which will lead us to long-range weather predictions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They make simple statements in a symbolic form . We run them off in our computer , downstairs . The program started in Washington , in 1958 , but in 1961 I persuaded in bosses in NASA to transfer it to New York , because there are more universities here . Our proximity to Columbia is an advantage . I teach there , and some of my colleagues teach there and at New York University , Stony Brook , Yeshiva , and City University . We recruit astronomy and atmospheric-sciences Ph.D.s from those places . We have a rotating pool of around twenty National Academy of Sciences Fellows , including foreigners , who are assigned to us . ' They come and go . We help them find places to live . " We mentioned his interstellar suggestions at the Geographical Society dinner , and lie said he was incorporating them in a book he is working on . " Our planet will soon be a very small speck in our own eyes , " he said . " We will move out in the solar system and beyond it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 'll he off the solar system in less than a thousand years . I think curiosity will become overwhelming . Would you like to see our computer ? " Dr. Jastrow presented us with a copy of a hook he has written , " Red Giants and White Dwarfs : The Evolution of Stars , Planets , and Life , " which has sold a hundred thousand hard-cover copies , and another hundred thousand in paperback , and we followed him to the elevator . Hunting the Egress JUST plain getting out of places these days poses special problems that know no boundaries . A much-travelled friend writes from a Bangkok hotel that a sign attached to two vertical wooden bars on the metal grille of his veranda reads PUSHING THESE Two WHITE BARS HARDLY WILL MAKE AN EMERGENCY EXIT Long-Winded Lady WE have received the following communication from the longwinded lady : " Tonight , I stood on the traffic island in the middle of Broadway at Forty-fifth Street and watched a 1- , - spectahly dressed middle-aged woman sing ' Bei Mir Bist Du Schiln ' at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could see . She was blind drunk , and from the sullen expression on her face I would say she was n't enjoying herself much . Her face was dark red , and on her short gray-black hair she wore a tiny hat of navy-blue felt trimmed with stiff net . She had n't enough breath to belt out the song , as she was trying to do , so she screamed the words in a hoarse voice that was colored more by bitterness and defiance than h ) music , but she kept good time with her umbrella , which she held high , pointed at the hoarding over the marquee of the Astor Theatre . Her hand seemed a lot steadier on the umbrella than her feet were on the ground , and as she sang and waved she did little humps and grinds with a desperate coquetry that shamed her matron ' ) dress and the sensible black shoes she wore . The last word of each line was a high point : ' " Bei mir bist du schOn ? Means that you 're grand . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're the fairest in the land . ' There were thousands of people on the street . It was just past seven o'clock , and Broadway was well into the evening phase of her everlasting rush hour . The sidewalks were so jammed that you would n't think there was room for one more pair of feet , and on each side of the traffic island the cars raced by , going downtown , speeding for the Battery with the green light all the way , it seemed . But the traffic island was very solid , and even seemed quiet and in darkness , as though the roar and the blazing lights and the frantic movement all around had swallowed it up and made it invisible . There were three of us waiting there besides the drunken woman , but we stood on the safe part , where the cement base of the island widens out to form a little platform , and she was balanced on the narrow runway outside the low cement wall of the " flower bed , " where bits of shrubbery wither in a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cloth and paper . It seemed she must either fall forward under the wheels of the cars or fall backward into the rubbish , but she kept her feet somehow . Her umbrella ( of beige silk , to match her gloves ) was very long and thin and excessively pointed , and her manner with it was vigorous . There was a lot of punch in THE NEW YORKER 19 " It 's a parade to celebrate the first National Nov People Week . " ? ? the way she waved it . The three of us standing on the island with her were just as much afraid of her as we were afraid for her . Arc just stood and watched her and wished the light would change , so that we might all be released from our oasis . I had seen her a few minutes earlier , on the east side of Broadway , near Forty-eighth Street . Wu walked alongside- each other there for a minute , pressed together by the great crowd . It was a night to he outside . There was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transfixed by lights that are too bright and not friendly . Those powerful storefront lights and cinema lights are meant for merchandise , not for human beings , and as we pushed along there the deep-dyed neon rays of red and green and blue- and white gave each face in the crowd a family likeness , so we all seemed to he related  --  dubious , discolored copies of one another . I first noticed the woman next to me because of the exhausted way she put her feet to the ground , and when I looked at her face I saw that she was drunk , but although she did n't seem conscious of the people around her she did n't seem lost . She seemed to know where she was , all right , as though she took the same route every night on her way home from work . She had a dull , sad face , the face of a derelict who is able to recognize only what is hateful to her , and which would change in sobriety only to grow watchful and , so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy in her navy-blur winter coat , and she ? carried a huge black leather handbag with a copy of the Post fitted into its side pocket . As soon as I saw an opening in the wall of hacks ahead of me , I hurried forward , and did n't see the woman again until she appeared on the edge of the traffic island and began to sing . When the light changed at last , the car that drew up alongside her was a taxi , and as soon as it stopped she slammed her umbrella down flat on the top of it and began staring in at the driver . He prudently raised his arm and grabbed the umbrella and held it tight against the top of the cab , so that she could n't lift it or pull it free . ' Come on , lady , ' he said . He was grinning , but he looked worried . I crossed over to the sidewalk and went along to the bookshop next door to the waxworks museum . It is really not a bookshop but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the queer objects manufacturers devise for sale as souvenirs . At the back , there is a small hook section , with cheap sets of the classics , and popular works on psychology , and paperbacks . I looked until I found a Dorothy Sayers . I took m3 time , because I did n't want to go outside and see that woman again . When I finally went out , the-re was no sign of her . She was gone , or if she was nearby she was quiet . At any rate , she was no longer in her place on the traffic island . I wonder about her , and how she came to be helpless like that in public . I wonder at the power of her nightmare  --  that it could wait for years and then trap her when she was finding her way home . I wonder hem much of all this she will remember tomorrow . Not much , think . Kind memory will fail her to save her for another day . She will say , ' Oh , what a blackout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomorrow she will have quite forgotten the dangers she survived and the adventures she made for herself on her way home tonight .
