txt Waiting It Out in Rhodesia Secretary of State Vance and British Foreign Secretary David . Owen did the only thing they could when they met this past week with the parties to the Rhodesian conflict : They listened , and made no promises . That was sensible , because the United States and . Britain . lack leverage to force a compromise between Prime Minister Smith and his new-found black partners on the one hand and their black Patriotic Front challengers on the other . Yet Washington and London may well have the logic of events going for them . Once the two Rhodesian sides step close enough to the precipice , they may decide that talking is better than fighting . ? The burden of compromise is likely to fall harder on the Salisbury Government than on the Patriotic Front . In the recent exploratory talks the Front went some distance ( but by no means all the way ) toward accepting the current version of last August 's Anglo-American plan , which still looks like the fairest way to provide for genuine majority rule while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British caretaker authority and United , Nations supervision of elections for a postindependence government . By contrast , the Salisbury Four ( Mr. Smith , Bishop Muzorewa , Mr. Sithole and Chief Chirau ) told Mr. Vance that they would " consider " the Anglo-American plan . But they contend that since they have already embarked on a course leading to rule by Rhodesia 's 97 percent black majority , it is up to the Front to come along on their terms . There is probably more bravado than substance behind their assertion that the future lies with them . Mr. Smith 's three black colleagues assume that once the guerrillas see black faces in the government they will abandon the struggle . But by some accounts , blacks have greeted last month 's " internal settlement " with skepticism at best , hostility at worst . It may , hence , be just as likely that the war will heat up as the training camps in Zambia and Mozambique turn out additional fighters , and as Soviet and Cuban aid ( if not active intervention ) intensifies . And as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , increases and the Rhodesian economy continues to decline , more whites are likely to conclude that the internal settlement has not worked . Their now gradual exodus from the country could become a torrent . Then the situation would resemble South Vietnam in 1975 : the guerrillas would be able to pick up the pieces . That distinct possibility is what keeps Joshua Nkomo and Robert Mugabe , the leaders of the Patriotic Front , from going further toward compromise . Yet they too must reckon that events might not go their way . The hospitality of neighboring Zambia and Mozambique is crucial to the guerrillas . But the war has crippled their economies . Zambians , especially , are said to resent the costs and the Rhodesian retaliatory attacks that the guerrillas have thrust upon them . While Moscow and Havana might increase their aid to the guerrillas , there is no sign they will do much to help Zambia and Mozambique . Secretary Vance and Mr. Owen seem to think that the way to narrow the gap between Mr. Nkomo and Bishop Muzorewa is to open one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Perhaps . But nothing is more likely to cause Mr. Nkomo to nail himself to Mr. Mugabe 's mast ( red flag atop it notwithstanding ) than the present well-advertised effort to pry him loose . And the premise upon which the effort rests is itself shaky  --  that if Mr. Nkomo comes to terms with the Salisbury Four , the several thousand guerrillas now loyal to him will do the same . Much depends upon the terms Mr. Nkomo might choose . Thus it all comes back to the internal agreement . Mr. Nkomo and Mr. Mugabe are right to oppose it . The constitution it decrees in advance entrenches minority white power for too long ; the procedures it sets out for holding elections offer inadequate assurance of participation by the Patriotic Front . The virtue of the AngloAmerican plan is that it comes as close as reason can to arrangements which protect minority rights but allow for effective majority rule and for a fair determination of majority wishes . For the next several months , therefore , as the guerrillas stick to their guns , Mr. Vance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
