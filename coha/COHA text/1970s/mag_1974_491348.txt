In America , the ways to the top are certainly various , and the proof of that is Jimmy Snyder , best known as " Jimmy the Greek , " but born as Demetrios Georgios Syno  --  dinos . We 're accustomed to reading about the boy who sold newspa  --  pers , worked at odd jobs around factory or office , rose in the firm , and one day became a U.S. Senator or scientist or corporation presi  --  dent . But in Jimmy the Greek we have a man who , in his puberty years , dealt blackjack in rough gam  --  ing houses in Steubenville , Ohio , walked out when loaded dice were rolled , concentrated on college football to the point of scholarly fascination ( but only to make odds on the games ) , survived the world of gambling , and one day , broke through . Jimmy as the Oddsmaker for the Nation won renown for abilities and knowledge beyond the gaming rooms and bookie joints . He had become an expert on the phe  --  nomenon of probability , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communications , public relations , politics and government , and even academia , because the Brookings Institution , and its nest  --  ful of scholars , had him as an infor  --  mative guest one day .

At fifty-four , Jimmy the Greek has arrived , and though euphemisms like " consultant " now describe his work , he remains as Oddsmaker for the Nation . He simply is a man who can look at a situation in sports , politics or business , apply his vast skills of calculation , and provide quite reliable odds as to how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To trail him even for a few days is to experi  --  ence a huge ( 229 pounds ) , lumbering , restless man whose mind never stops and whose callers never fail to express their insistence . Jimmy ar  --  rived back in Las Vegas , the city which thrives on chance , the day after the celebrated tennis match in Houston between Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs . That lively event left Jimmy with ambiva  --  lent feelings . He had made Riggs the 5-2 favorite , and ground his molars as Riggs faded before the sure , strong game of Ms. King . Jimmy finally concluded that Riggs had exhausted himself in pre-match exploitation , and had failed to get in shape . Jimmy 's decided the odds are now even in a rematch , providing that Riggs trains properly . " Everybody thinks I am so down because we made Riggs the favorite , " Jimmy told one and all back in Las Vegas . " Why hell , one of our biggest coups down there was the publicity we got for my client . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tremendous big winner , right in front of fifty million people . " Jimmy 's client , of course , was Nabisco , manu  --  facturer of the Sugar Daddy all-day sucker . Just before the match , on national television , Bobby Riggs presented Ms. King with a giant version ( " the world 's biggest " ) of the Sugar Daddy suck  --  er , as though it were a degrading message . Who in the TV audience does n't know what a Sugar Dad  --  dy is now ? " I paid them each $10,000 for going through with that stunt , " says Jimmy . " That was cheap exposure . i was lucky that Howard Cosell put the camera right on them . " The nerve center from which Jimmy creates such schemes is on the second floor of the Tropi  --  cana Golf Club , with its heavenly thick carpeting , smart decor , and look pronouncing that this is really class . Jimmy 's huge , glistening white desk is mounted on a platform so that when he sits there , he virtually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pants . The desk has the usual col  --  lection of knickknacks and memen  --  toes , but the real business is run through the console telephone with its urgent flashing lights . Everybody wants Jimmy , even on Saturday . He tells them that the quarterback in question has a bum shoulder , that 's why the number is 3-2 . He gets tickets for friends . He lets the Tropicana Hotel desk know that the best suite should be ready for visiting officials of the Greek government . A marketing group for " Jimmy The Greek 's Pro Football Schedule Scorecard " ( $1 a copy and in type so small , the middle-aged might as well give up ) has been waiting in the outer room for hours to cajole him into making radio and TV commercials to sell it . He sum  --  mons the names of firms which might help distribute the new item . He relents and tapes the commer  --  cial . He calls for Mountain Valley water by brand name when he 's thirsty . Two TV sets and a radio are con @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in agony . He had made the University of Southern Califor  --  nia ( USC ) a nineteen-point favorite over Georgia Tech . USC was slow to move , and if they had n't pushed nine points across in the last quar  --  ter , Jimmy would have looked terri  --  ble . The score is now 23-6 , and the end is near . Jimmy is going to be two points off , and that 's purgatory for him . The phone rings again . There 's a mixup at the front desk . A dentist named Dr. Phedon was mistakenly given the suite reserved for the two visiting dignitaries from the Greek government , one of whom is a Dr. Phed  --  ron-Hatjulis . " A 100.1 shot , " says Jimmy in his annoyance . " A 100-1 that an American named Phedon would come in and get the room . " It takes some push for Jimmy to get the surprised American Phedon out of the room and the stalled dignitaries in . With the sweat running down his chubby face . Jimmy hurries from his posh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Las Vegas . The traffic flow is fast and endless , and he must cross the broad road to the sprawling luxury ho  --  tel he represents as public relations counsel . The important Greek officials are waiting . " See this traffic ? " he asks me . " The management figures it 's 2-1 I get killed out here one day . " He soothes the Greek visitors with flattery , a round of drinks , and reminiscences about his pleasurable trip to Greece . All 's well , and he makes plans to host the important visitors at dinner that night . Then , hurry back to the Golf Club and his offices , where a crew from NBC 's " Today " show waits . The phone is ringing , and Jimmy is telling somebody he does n't know what the number is on that game yet , call back in a couple of days . Then he tells his assistant , George King , who assists in putting Jimmy 's syndi  --  cated column on sports odds together , to delete this and delete that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deep , soft as silk , pow  --  der blue , velveteen couch , fit for a rajah . On camera , he explains the Riggs goof : " To use the Watergate way of saying it , at this point in time , Riggs was a 5-2 fa  --  vorite , but ... . " Political odds are no harder to fig  --  ure . No , he , Jimmy , has n't laid a bet in eleven years , although 70 percent of adult Americans make a wager once in a while be  --  cause " betting is a chal  --  lenge to the human spirit. - He went on : " I hate gam  --  bling , especially casino gambling " ( the kind his own hotel becomes rich on , and that 's a bit of a heresy ) . He covers himself , though , by describing such gambling as recreation , and if you know the odds are that you are going to lose , why then it is just en  --  joyable recreation , and " Las Vegas is the greatest place in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NBC crew to visit Greece , do some program , and " may  --  be I 'll get their account " - the latter uttered half in humor and half in hope . Now he must hurry home to dress for his din  --  ner with the visiting Greek officials . " They 'd like to build a hotel in Greece named after me and give me half , " he said as he was driving his Oldsmo  --  bile through well-appointed neighborhoods . " The land alone would be worth it . You know the six richest men in the world are Greek ? They know how to do it . Onassis is nothing compared to them . " He pulls up on the cres  --  cent driveway in front of his ground-hugging , ranch home . Inside , he 's sur  --  prised how neat everything is , and he goes to the kitchen to kiss his wife of twenty-one years , Joan , an attractive , smiling woman who seems happy making hamburgers for dinner , but not to be eaten by Jimmy this night . The radios and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ games are going . Jimmy goes out by the swimming pool where Anthony . hand Own Home I Rent Telephone ( include area code ) Street 4 some and strapping though only nine , is shooting bow and arrows . Father and son are affectionate with each other , and Jimmy , another glass of Mountain Valley water in hand , stands by to check his son 's archery skills . But after a few moments Jimmy says , " There 's not much time , " and hurries into the 28 THE SATURDAY EVENING POST January /February ' 74 house to dress , instructing me to play table ten  --  nis with Anthony , which I do . But the game is soon interrupted because Jimmy hustles out , dressed par excellence , a bit of perspiration on his brow . " Good-bye , dear , " he calls to the kitch  --  en , and lie 's on his way again . He will dine and talk and sit up with his Greek guests until 2:30 a.m . Next morning , at 10:30 , eight hours after say  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jimmy the Greek yawns and begins telling me the story of his life . He was born September 9 , 1919 , near Steubenville , Ohio , a tough mill town on the Ohio River , which has neither gained nor lost population over the years , and remains a hometown forever for the scores of thousands who left there . His father , Georgios , ran a small grocery on Fifth Street which supplied neighbor  --  hood folk and small restaurants as well . When the family gathered around , uncles and aunts , the talk was always that Jimmy was destined to be  --  come a priest in the Greek Orthodox Church , just as one member of the Synodinos family had done for generations . The very name Synodinos means church . Jimmy recalls , " Oh boy , they 'd say , Demetrios will be the priest . ' I went to church and believed and all that . But early in life , everybody found out I was n't going to be a priest . My mother would say , in Greek , ' This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's going to be some big attorney or something . He wants to do things . He would never be satisfied being a priest ' " Had she lived , I 'm sure my life would have been entirely different . I would have gone to college . 1 would never have gotten involved in gambling and things like that . " Jimmy says his mother passed away in " a horrible situation " one night in March , 1929 , when he was nine . " It was quite a tragedy , " he said painfully . " My mother 's sister , my aunt , had left her husband and she came , of course , to our house to stay . He his uncle came over one Saturday night and just waited for them outside with a gun and just killed them both . And then he killed himself . " When mother died that way , I became a big boy , right then and there because whether it was games or football and bicycles , it just seemed like all of a sudden that those things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plateful from Jimmy the Greek . His father , aghast at the horror afflicting his fam  --  ily , took his three children to the Greek island of Keos to live , to cleanse their memories of trage  --  dy . There was sun and sea , and as Jimmy remem  --  bers , " the figs and the fruits and the vegetables , it was beautiful . " His father had enough savings so that he did n't have to work in order to sup  --  port his family . At night , Jimmy hung around with older people who played cards , and when he was n't being tutored , engaged in his first form of gambling . " We put drachmas coins on top of a stone , and we would throw stones to knock the drach  --  mas off , " he explains . " The drachmas would fly and you would win , or whosever stone was closest to the drachmas won . I went out andfound the smallest rock to throw so I could con  --  trol it . 1 had quite a bit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , the family returned to Steu  --  benville , just as the Depression deepened . George Synodinos had married a woman he met in Greece . She spoke no English when they all ar  --  rived in Steubenville . " He never should have come back , really , but if he had n't , I guess there would n't be a Jimmy the Greek , " Jimmy says . " Dad was living off some insurance policy that he retired off of at $1,000 a month , a fantastic amount of money in those days . We could have lived fine in Greece on that . " When they returned , Jimmy was twelve , and he looked around and saw " the hard times , and all that mill dirt I looked so healthy and had all that olive color , and two girls in Stanton Park looked at me and said ' Look at that handsome guy . ' I said to myself , Gee whiz , I wish I was older . ' " When I was twelve I became a hustler . I got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the junkyard and made sixty cents , eighty cents , something like that . One day I saw this frame of a bicycle and I said to this guy , ' Gee whiz , what do you want for it ? ' and he sez , Gim me a quarter , ' and I said okay . Next thing I knew I was out getting parts , and I remember buying a New Departure brake and putting bicy  --  cles together , a part here , and a part there . I finished up with five of them and renting them out to kids for ten cents . I was always making a buck . " It 's a legend now that Jimmy at fourteen forged his name to his school savings account so he could take the money out and bet it all on Cavalcade to win the Kentucky Derby in 1934 . He was hooked on betting now , and hung around Steubenville 's pool halls and betting parlors . At home , though , his father reminded him to think about college . Jimmy wistfully recalls : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school and he 's going to graduate and he 's going to go out and show everybody . ' " My father was so confident I would be a success . It was almost a fanatic attitude , On Sun  --  day all the Greeks came to George 's home be  --  cause that was where all the food was on the table , the little buffet for Sunday . They played cards , pinochle . During the Christmas holidays , they played poker . " In school , Jimmy was an erratic student . Like most boys , he tried football . " I was a very well-to-do six footer , " he says , talking about his build and not his wealth , " at the right weight and very trim . I had decent hands , and if you got it the ball out there , if I touched it , like the coach said , ' If the Greek touches it , he catches it . ' " 1 can never remember being called anything but the Greek , and not exactly in fondness all the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ohio , you had the Polacks and there were always the blacks  --  and you had the Irish bunch , and you had to fight your way through school . " I remember tackling on the kickoff once , and the boy that took the ball was Sullivan and he got up and said , ' You do n't have to hit so hard , Greek . ' And I said , ' We 're not playing touch . ' On the first play af  --  ter that , here they come , a wide-end sweep , and then everybody is heading for the Greek . Somebody put a block into me , and I 'm still trying to catch the guy that 's got the ball . " In those days , they had leather shoes with cleats on the bottom with nails in them . I know I 'm go  --  ing to my grave with this , but he stepped right on my hand , and I 'm looking down on it and it is bleed  --  ing like crazy , and I could see the bone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' Do I need this ? ' and decided I could n't play football after that . So I played football from then on but in a different way , by betting fifty cents or a dollar with the kids . " After high school , Jimmy went fast for the money , and one day his banker said , " ' For God 's sake , Jim  --  my , do something about your name , it 's spelled ten different ways on your checks , and its murder . ' " " So I said , ' I guess I 'll go by the name of my uncle , who took Snyder , ' " Jimmy recalls with some regret . " I 've always been sorry for it , believe it or not , because there 's nothing Greek about Snyder . If I had taken Stevens even . or Stephanos , or my mother 's name , Sultani  --  Claudias . " Jimmy went into an underground life in the seamy streets of Steubenville . " We had eleven gambling houses , There were never any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nolan ran that whole county . For eleven years , that town ran wide open and yet there were never any killings , any rapes , nothing . Origi  --  nally , they had crooked dice and cards , but that got straightened out . We were shooting craps One night and I caught somebody maneuvering , try  --  ing to put some crooked dice . We were just young guys . 1 did n't say a word . I just picked up the money and walked out . I said if I have to worry about things like that all the time , I might as well forget about it .

Up there , they were run by Bill Hecht , a real beautiful , wonder  --  ful businessman . Billy immediately saw that I knew the Southeastern conference . He was a good man . But he quit in 1952 when that Kefauver thing got going . " In the late Forties , Jimmy became self-conscious about his gambling .

Old Baruch says , ' Young man , you 're go  --  ing to be broke and rich seven times in your life . Be sure you watch the seventh . ' I 've never forgotten that . " The Fifties were Jimmy 's heyday for betting . He won and lost millions in that decade and until 1962 when the law changed . Interstate betting was prohibited ; a 10 percent federal tax was levied on intrastate betting . In 1951 , he had perhaps his biggest single bet loss when he took Ken  --  tucky over Santa Clara in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kind Jimmy likes , and which could then be placed in betting parlors in many states . Today , only Las Vegas has parlors . Betting , says Jimmy , is when you match your wits and knowledge against another man 's , and thus it is a challenge . Gambling can be mindless such as when a person plays slot ma  --  chines , craps or blackjack . When Jimmy was betting , he picked win  --  ners in football , baseball , basketball , hockey , golf tournaments , and elec  --  tions . He bet Nixon in 1960 and lost , though he won on individual bets on Nixon carrying California and Ohio . He never lost on Eisenhower and he picked  --  though he says he did n't bet ? the winners in the 1964 , 1968 and 1972 presidential elections . Jim  --  my used to even lay odds on execu  --  tions , and had it 4-1 that Caryl Chessman " was a favorite to go " ( to the gas chamber ) in 1960 , which he did . Jimmy has also set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington , D.C. , what New York City 's chances were for another power failure , and who might win an Oscar in the Academy Awards . Jimmy had been in Las Vegas many times before he moved his family there to live in November , 1956 . He opened a betting parlor called " Hollywood Sports Service , " which , like all such parlors , became shabby and grimy , with cigarette and cigar butts and crumpled papers in characteristic profusion . Jimmy 's soon did more business than any oth  --  er parlor in Las Vegas . Betting was one way Jimmy made money in his shop . But the steady profit came from the vigorish , the oddsmaker 's operating margin . Each bettor had to wager $11 for every $ 10 he expected to win . Thus Jimmy would adjust the point spread so that in a football game , say , both teams drew bets of $1,100 , for a total of $2,200 ; Jimmy would only have to pay $2,100 , no matter how the score came out . The $100 difference was Jimmy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the money moved toward one team , the odds-maker was in trouble , and from this point on , it would take a certified public accountant , or Jimmy him  --  self , to calculate how the oddsmaker could escape without , as Jimmy says , " being carried out feet first , baby . " Jimmy was known in the trade as an independent , and not hooked up with any mob . He claims he never felt danger . " Certain people asked me to join and things like that , " he explains , " hut I did n't enter into any propositions with them , and they re  --  spected me because they wanted me to give my figures , and to bet with me . " I got heisted one time , in my ho  --  tel room in Miami , and some guy , let us call him an acquaintance , found out about it , and he called me and said , ' You come on back down . ' When they robbed me I had $3,300 in cash and this ring and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave me $2,700 and my ring and watch . He told me the guys who robbed me were busted , so he let them keep $300 apiece . So I said , Here 's $700 more for them . ' I did n't ask my acquaintance how he found these guys , and I still do n't want to know . " Happily for Jimmy , when the new anti-gambling laws took force and he was forced out of betting , about 1963 , newsmen and writers discovered him . Jimmy did research projects for publications and in turn was interviewed about his magnifi  --  cent skills in odds-making . " Jimmy the Greek " became known as Odds-maker for the Nation . With his le  --  gions of contacts , he seemed a nat  --  ural for public relations . " I guess 1 always did public rela  --  tions and did n't know it . People said , Hey Jimmy , you know so and so , why do n't you ask him to do this ? ' Finally , in 1964 , when I did a guy a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' Let 's see what we can do here for Jimmy .

" In 1966 , Jimmy formed his P.R . firm , " Sports Unlimited , " and picked up a client named Howard Hughes , who paid him $100,000 a year for openers . On Hughes 's or  --  ders , Jimmy lobbied successfully against the resumption of high-mega  --  ton nuclear testing in Nevada and also kept dog-racing out of the state . He also tended P.R . for Hughes 's Las Vegas hotels . But after four years Jimmy lost the account when the ec  --  centric Hughes fired his chief execu  --  tive and Jimmy as well . " I never saw Hughes even once , " Jimmy says . " I just serviced his operations , you know , his hotels . I did n't do his hold  --  ings . I was sort of the firefighter , the out-front guy . " So here was Jimmy , in his late forties , seemingly retired from the gambling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person  --  ality and superiority in oddsmaking . The tribute came to his door  --  speak  --  ing engagements at $1,500 to $2,500 a speech ( he averages forty a year ) ; lucrative fees for doing TV commer ? cials ; another $100,000 a year from his syndicated column and his Mutu  --  al Radio Network commentaries ; and most profitable of all , the public relations accounts . So there 's Jimmy talking it up , and spinning ideas for the Tropicana Hotel ; Lum 's and 011ieburger fast food chains ; Aurora Products ( toys ) ; Pacific Holding Corp. ; Bigelow Mo  --  bile Homes ; Time , Inc. ; Edge Shav  --  ing Cream ( Johnson Wax Co . ) ; Sys  --  tems Management , Inc. ; and the Uni  --  versity of Nevada .

" He can get more done than an entire New York P.R . firm . He has imagination , contacts , and knows how to sell . " P.S. : Jimmy is promoting Brown 's two businesses  --  Lum 's Restaurants , and the new " 011ie 's Trolleys " chain . In Kansas City , the Chevrolet dealers went wild about Jimmy a few years hack , and paid him handsome  --  ly for ads proclaiming : " America 's #1 Oddsmaker Just Took the Gam  --  ble Out of Buying Your Next Car- a Chevrolet . " Jimmy comes at you on the TV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Edge wanted it 3-1 , but Jimmy says it was only 5-2 . Jimmy is so dead-serious about oddsmaking that he goes through torture on Saturday and Sunday af  --  ternoons if the games come out one or two points off from his forecasts . For Jimmy , that game is the culmi  --  nation of years of experience , and weeks of tedious information gather  --  ing . Behind Jimmy 's decision for the right " number " on a sports event are four men expert in sports oddsmak  --  ing ( " they got 110 years ' combined experience " ) ; two-score sportswrit  --  ers across the country whom Jimmy phones personally , as well as the owners of some of the pro football teams ; and occasionally even the players themselves , though Jimmy wo n't own up to that . Plus those for  --  ty newspapers and magazines Jimmy subscribes to , reading their sports in  --  formation the way a good physician should read the medical journals . Plus those well kept filing cabinets brimful with information about teams , players , their mental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idiosyncrasies about cer  --  tain stadiums , the incidence of vic  --  tories on home fields , the records of the coaches  --  every factor that can go into a performance . His overall rec  --  ord on picks is 85 percent right . What Jimmy did n't consciously realize is that his eclectic system , phone calls and all , approximates the scientific method . But a man like Jack Higginson , executive vice-presi  --  dent of Systems Management , Inc. , a computer service firm , knows Jim  --  my 's skills and that 's why he signed him on as consultant and P.R . man one year ago . One of S.M.I. 's accomplishments is the " Bio-Curve , " based on bio  --  medical theory , wherein , say , an ath  --  lete 's peak productivity can be chart  --  ed along with his lows . " People 's per  --  formance in life is cyclical , " explains Higginson , " and if you chart a per  --  son for three years , day by day , test ing his physical , emotional and men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pattern . " Jimmy has been doing this for years , and making projections out of a man 's past performance . He studies and listens harder than anyone I 've ever been with . He takes everything out of my mind , and when he 's finished , I 'm beat . " Thus Jimmy , in tandem with Higginson 's firm , with unusual accuracy , charted the bio-curves of Chicago Cub players , the Los Ange  --  les Dodgers and the foot  --  ball players of the Oakland Raiders . Even more excit  --  ing was Jimmy 's study of the home run production of Hank Aaron , the Atlanta Braves star , who neared Babe Ruth 's record last sea  --  son . On August 25 , Jimmy calculated that Aaron would hit 7.6 more homers in the rest of the season , and thus come within 1.4 homers of tying Ruth 's rec  --  ord . Aaron hit eight more homers , and who can say Jimmy was off ?

We 're going to form a mar  --  ket research company , maybe even do a stock let  --  ter , not stock tips , but a market trend situation . I 'm proud that we picked the day that the Dow-Jones av  --  erage would break 1,000 . " There 's not a damn bit of difference between re  --  searching for a bet and re  --  searching a business situa  --  tion . The only difference is that you put your money up immediately on a bet . " Jimmy will have to build this new effort around his present public relations staff of nine full-time em  --  ployees and ten consul  --  tants . For his political ef  --  fort , he already has a string of political reporters across the country whom he can phone ? and pay  --  for infor  --  mation . He claims he has re  --  fined his political research considerably from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professional pollsters . It had to do with a mustache . " I came home one day and told my sister I was go  --  ing to raise a mustache so I would look older . She told Continued on page 118 continued horn page 98 me that women did n't like mus  --  taches , and the next day I noticed Dewey 's mustache in a newspaper picture . That bugged me , so I hired four women and put them in front of a grocery store to poll women on mustaches . Of the 500 girls ' school . I became Catholic , too . " Joanie 's very attractive , even at forty-four . I call her the ' hard eight ' and she says , ' What does that mean ? ' She 's such a square . She 's always talking to me about my work . In fact , she handles all the money now . " Last October , I 'm going through the bills with the accountant and every other bill was for a check writ  --  ten to Joanie . I blew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

' I said , ' I 'm not peeved , honey , but you spend too much money . From now on , you 're going to take all my money , deposit they asked , 350 did n't like mustaches , 125 said they did , and 25 said , I do n't care what it is as long as it 's a man . ' So then I polled 1,500 other people in Ohio , but no on mus  --  taches , and saw that Tru  --  man-Dewey was a toss-up in Ohio , which meant bad for Dewey because Ohio usually goes Republican . I picked Truman , and I won $170,000 in bets . " Years later , observers noted that Jimmy the Greek had a good average on picking elections . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days before the 1968 G.O.P. convention , and a few days before the 1968 election that fall bravely made Nixon an 8-5 favorite over Humphrey , who was fast closing the gap . Among the impressed was Jack Anderson , the columnist , who arranged with Jimmy to print his political fore  --  casts . Accordingly , Jimmy correctly picked George Wallace to win the 1972 Florida primary , and was on the nose in other key Democratic primaries . He was off on George Mc  --  Govern , but was right in proclaiming that the Cali  --  fornia primary between McGovern and Hubert Humphrey would be close , though pollsters said other  --  wise . He had Nixon the fa  --  vorite all the way in 1972 . " I ca n't go by polls be  --  cause what I add up is elec  --  toral votes , " he explained . " That 's what elects you , baby .

He met his wife , Joan , when she was vacationing in Florida in 1952 , and they soon married . " We 're happier now than we 've ever been , " Jimmy says .

Her father was a prominent Indiana businessman and she graduated from St , Mary-of- the-Woods in Terre Haute , a Catholic it , and you and the accountant are going to make all the checks out . You 're going to sign them . You are the keeper of the money from now on . ' You know , she 's written only two checks to herself since last October ? " But Jimmy confesses this is a real marriage , not a no-go like his first . " It cost me seven dollars to get mar  --  ried the first time , and $700,000 to get rid of her . But I got my daughter Vicky out of that , and raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine guy here in Las Vegas . " Jimmy and Joanie had four chil  --  dren , but sadly , two were born with cystic fibrosis . James , seventeen , seems to be successfully growing out of it , though he laments , " Why do I have to take three medicines and twelve pills a day and nobody else does ? " But he 's healthy enough for archery , bowling and karate . Their youngest child , Christina , died in 1968 , at the age of two and a half . She was a fragile , beautiful child , who spent much of her life in the hospital . " The most heartbreak  --  ing thing in my life was the death of our little girl .
