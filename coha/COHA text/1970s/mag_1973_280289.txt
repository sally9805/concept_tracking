It may have been the most neatly buried nugget in all that John Dean said . In one brief paragraph of his 245-page testimony before the Senate Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities last week , Dean dropped an obscure reference to a client of Super-lawyer F. Lee Bailey 's who " had an enormous amount of gold " to dispose of . As Dean told the story , the gold had come up during a luncheon conversation he had on March 22 with John Mitchell . What was Bailey up to , and how was Mitchell involved ? The story behind Dean 's fleeting remark lies somewhere between the fantastic and the farfetched . <P> It seems that a group of men learned of a hoard of hidden gold . The cache was old Aztec gold , they insisted , 60% pure . Some of it was in the form of artifacts , the rest in gleaming gold bars . What is more , there were 100 tons of it in all . At the current rate of $120 per oz. , their startling find would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , private individuals are not permitted to deal in gold without a license . The gold was buried on a military reservation in New Mexico , and the men ( there are a total of 50 in the claim consortium now , says Bailey ) did not want to risk going onto Government property to claim the gold without prior agreement that the Government would issue them a license to sell it . <P> Such a tantalus of riches required special handling , and the consortium sought the services of Bailey . Initially skeptical , Bailey requested that he be permitted to visit the site . Although he received tacit permission from the Government , the group refused to allow it , fearing that when they sought to lead him there , they might be arrested . In an effort to solve such problems , Bailey had called John Mitchell in mid-March . Mitchell first referred the matter to then White House Chief of Staff H.R. Haldeman , who was " nonresponsive . " Mitchell next suggested that Bailey " try the White House " on his own , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of contacts with the U.S. <P> Treasury Department followed . When Bailey took his case to Thomas W. Wolfe , director of the Treasury Department 's Office of Domestic Gold and Silver Operations , Wolfe bluntly told Bailey his clients were full of " malarkey . " In a June 5 letter to Bailey , Wolfe brushed off the attorney with a tart reminder that any gold discovery must be reported to the Secret Service , and then offered a less than heartfelt suggestion that Bailey ask the Army for special permission to locate the gold on its land . <P> Last week Bailey continued to decline to name his clients and remained upset at the prospect of the gold 's being stolen . Apparently , the gold has already been the object of pilferers in the area . Bailey argues that his clients are entitled to the full value of the gold , even though they will have to pay 50% of it to the Government . Bailey threatens a lawsuit if the Government fails to honor his clients ' request . But there is reason to wonder if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a new version of the old treasure of the Sierra Madre story , " said one Treasury official . " Every couple of years somebody claims to find that treasure . But the treasure never materializes. "
