txt The weekend rally in New Haven protesting the murder trial of Black Panther leader Bobby Seale ended peacefully , contrary to predictions that it would result in large-scale violence . Two sunny days of heavy political speeches were marred only by scattered evening skirmishes between a relatively few violence-bent demonstrators and New Haven police and National Guard troops . Some 2,000 guardsmen had been called up , although they were kept out of sight of the green , and 4,000 Army paratroopers and marines were flown into neighboring states on standby on Thursday . .7t The only serious incident was a small explosion in the Ingall 's hockey rink , causing around $75,000 worth of damage . At this writing the culprits had not been found . The rally attracted about 15,000 outside visitors ( compared with predictions of up to 50,000 ) , mostly seriously political students or Yippies ( self-styled " cultural revolutionaries " ) from Boston , New York , Philadelphia , Washington , Ann Arbor , Mich. , Ohio , and as far as San Francisco and Louisiana . Pressure sought Predictions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks before the rally by BlaCk Panthers and the " Chicago 8 " suggesting among other things that demonstrators burn down Yale , bring guns , and " off pigs ( kill the police ) . " The demonstrations , organized by largely white Panther support committees , were aimed at putting pressure on the government to free Bobby Seale and the other eight New Haven Panther defendants , as well as at focusing national and international attention on the trial . ( Numerous European newspapers covered the demonstration . ) In speeches before and during the demonstrations , the " Chicago 8 " ( five of whom were convicted of crossing state lines to incite a riot at the Democratic National Convention of 1968 in a trial which originally included Bobby Seale ) repeatedly emphasized the effectiveness of mass pressure in aiding defendants in political trials . // * Cooling it ' at Panther rally // But shortly before the weekend , Panther leaders did an abrupt about-face on the violence issue . They explained that the black community in New Haven would suffer reprisals if white demonstrators did damage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being by superior force and numbers . As a result Panther leaders were the primary force in preventing outbursts from many demonstrators bent on violence . Along with student marshals from Yale , who won the admiration of Police Chief James Ahern , Panthers patrolled the New Haven green and nearby streets on Friday and Saturday evening admonishing people to go back to the Yale campus , and insisting that those doing violence were " pig provocateurs . " Police and National Guard conducted a large-scale tear-gassing of the campus on Saturday night to " clear the streets , " although many of those on the streets were newsmen and students forced out of their dormitories by drifting gas . Decision stirs controversy The Panther decision to " cool it " aroused controversy among many demonstrators . " For weeks they 've been telling us to come down here with guns , and now suddenly they change , " yelled a New York student . " We 've got to prove ourselves as revolutionaries , " he yelled , echoing a recurrent theme . " You 're here to follow what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived to calm the scene . " When the time comes , we 'll tell you what to do , " he admonished . Radical focal point This conflict showed some of the tensions between the Panthers and their white supporters . At a time when the white radical movement is fragmented and largely undisciplined , the Panthers provide a charismatic , well-organized focal point . Thdy also provide an example of radicals apparently unafraid to take violent action  --  which they say is in self-defense  --  and who have paid dearly for it in numbers shot and arrested . This gives them added attraction in the eyes of white radicals mired in intellectual discussions . But the conflicts which observers note within the Panther Party  --  over whether or not to encourage alliances with whites , and whether to restrain violent action  --  have confused some of the Panther supporters . " There are two revolutions going on , " insists Abbie Hoffman , " and white radicals should n't feel they have to only follow the Panthers . " Cambodia linked Despite these conflicts the Panthers are likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future , along with the issue of American involvement in Cambodia , which several platform speakers linked up with the trial issue . Plans are already tentatively scheduled for a rally in Washington on May 9 to protest both those issues , and the " Chicago 8 " called for all radicals to make their way to New Haven this summer to keep the pressure on the trial . There is one issue , however , on which all Panther supporters agree : They say the Panthers are being systematically persecuted by the government and can not get a fair trial , and that they must be freed " by any means necessary . " Little political communication But with few exceptions there was little political communication between Yalies and the visitors . Said one Yale student : " Most people here are still discussing the legal issues of providing a fair trial , even though they have their doubts whether it can be done . But on the green , that issue was never mentioned . " Although an estimated half of Yale students left for the weekend , mostly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , those who remained put together a massive organization which impressed most visitors . The 12 Yale colleges dished out rice , salad , Familia , bread and cold drinks . Housing centers , comfort stations , toilets , and medical aid stations were neatly marked with large green and red symbols on the outside . Fifty roving medical teams moved about the campus , and four emergency medical centers were set up . Most of these had little to do but treat tear-gas victims . For Yale , the May Day weekend came as almost an adjunct to a student strike which had been in progress ior a week before . The strike centered on the trial issue , as well as that of Yale 's relationship to the black community which surrounds it . On Sunday Dr. Kingman Brewster , Yale president , called for a return to classes on May 5 , after expressing his " profound gratitude " to Yale students . Most students contacted by this reporter seemed willing to return . However , the strike steering committee , which discussed the five strike demands with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unsatisfactory . " The committee is calling for a continued , noncoercive strike .
