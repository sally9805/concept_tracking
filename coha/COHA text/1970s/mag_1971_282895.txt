ON the bleak coast of the Barents Sea , where the Soviet Union shares a common border with Norway near the roof of the world , the Norwegian defense force of 400 men is frequently witness to a disturbing scene . They watch on radar as the Soviets practice assaults on the coast of their Kola Peninsula , some 300 miles away . In the Soviet war games , the attacking force is always victorious and the defenders are always defeated . <P> That spectacle points up a growing Soviet threat to the northern flank of NATO , which extends from Norway 's North Cape to West Germany 's Baltic coast ( see map ) . NATO 's northern command is outnumbered by the Soviets four-to-one on the ground , seven-to-one in aircraft and six-to-one in ships in the north . " The Russians are very busy displaying raw military power on the northern flank , " reports TIME Correspondent John Mulliken , who recently toured the region . " It is a significant example of how the Soviets intend to use the pressure of their operational armed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1980s . " <P> The Russians ' overwhelming military predominance in the northern flank is most evident in the icy waters of the area . Since the Soviet navy launched a massive buildup after the 1962 Cuban crisis , it has become , as Jane 's Fighting Ships notes , " the supernavy of a superpower . " Moscow 's growing strength at sea has long since been noted in the Mediterranean and in the Indian Ocean . But the fact is that the northern fleet , the smallest in the Soviet navy at the end of World War II , is now the biggest-the superfleet of a supernavy . <P> Operating out of ice-free Murmansk , the northern fleet has an estimated 560 ships , including 160 submarines , more than 65 of them nuclear-powered ( but not counting sizable forces in the Baltic , plus the East German and Polish navies ) . By contrast , the entire U.S. Atlantic Fleet has 358 ships , of which 40 to 50 are assigned to the Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean . Since 1968 , the U.S. command has been cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is scheduled to lose another ten ships by next summer . Says Norway 's Rear Admiral Magne Braadland : " The threat to the U.S. is not coming from Viet Nam and not from Central Europe either . It is sailing from Murmansk . "
