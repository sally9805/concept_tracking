When an economy disintegrates , the ideas which have supported it are likely to fall apart as well . With the U.S , economy devastated by simultaneous inflation and unemployment , with the dollar falling more rapidly than a tragic hero , with the rise of competition from the Japanese , and with total world domination no longer a real possibility , all those apologists for the American system who praised its prosperity , affluence , and ability to solve every problem that could ever arise find themselves as unemployable as aircraft workers in Seattle . Some , to be sure , pretend they never meant it and imperceptibly alter their analyses so that they become moderate critics of the society , in the fashion of John Kenneth Galbraith . Others just forget what they said , knowing that in America anything which happened five years ago is likely to be forgotten if it is not mentioned . It certainly is fascinating that economics , which prided itself on being such a " hard science , " could have been so blind about the directions that the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economics requires a re-examination of the alternatives to it , particularly the conservative and radical approaches . Watching the liberals play intellectual musical chairs with their hypotheses leads one to a guarded respect for writers like Milton Friedman , who are at least honest , even if they are wrong . But Friedman was never able to control his sympathizers , since it was the capitalists themselves who murdered laissez faire , and as a result the only tradition with any potential viability is the radical tradition in economics . There is such a tradition , even if it is rarely taught in economics departments . There was Marx , of course , but in this case one need not even go to Europe , for the United States gave the world Thorstein Veblen . After him came a series of iconoclastic writers , men like Robert Brady and Paul Baran , who taught and wrote their books in comparative isolation . ( When I was in graduate school one of my most famous professors told me never , under any circumstances , to read Brady 's Business as a System @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to memory . ) And in the past few years , the creation and success of the Union for a Radical Political Economics insures that the tradition will live . Conventional economists who pride themselves on hiring only the " best " young economists for their departments now find themselves with rooms full of Mdrxists wherever they turn . The stagnation of one approach is intimately connected with the , vitality of the other . In this context , one turns to Douglas Dowd 's new book with anticipation . Dowd is one of those courageous people THE NATION/October 26 , 1974 who maintained his fidelity to a radical tradition in economics during the bleakest years for dissenters that this country ever experienced . Along with the Monthly Review writers like Paul Sweezy , Leo Huberman , and Harry Mag6doff , he kept that tradition alive when T almost no one listened and has survived td see that tradition flourish . Dowd has also remembered Veblen , seeing him for what he was , a radical critic of a system in the making , when some , like Daniel Bell and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pure cynic , and others , the remaining radicals , saw only Marx . Finally , Dowd is , and always has been , a political economist , one not likely to lose himself in mathematical formulations , one who knows that economics is inevitably about politics . Clearly here is a man whose time has come . In spite of these good auguries , The Twisted Dream is a disappointment . The purpose of the book is to , provide an introduction to the changes that have ? occurred in the economy of this country leading up to what Dowd describes as , a full-scale social crisis existing at this moment . As he rightly observes , " the question why , when asked of social problems , is always historical , " but , and this is also to his credit , Dowd does not just tell a story . Instead , the book is organized by , themes , not by eras , and in each theme ( agriculture , economic concentration , the role of the state ) , historical considerations are introduced . Basing himself on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he tries to show how every aspect of life in the United States has , been affected by the rampaging desires of an economic system whose appetite can never be satisfied . As a review of a wide literature on the problems created by capitalism , the book succeeds . Nevertheless , as an attempt to advance our understanding of the state of the United States , it faces certain problems that it does not overcome . In a venture of this sort , to do too much is to do too little , acrd this is the contradiction which emerges in each chapter . The problem would seem to be this : the fear of radicalism in American academic life led to the creation of a theoretical vacuum in which the Marxist , tradition in economics was consigned to footnotes in the textbooks . When that vacuous consensus broke down , , when it was discovered that Marx had laid the foundations of a genuinely useful theory , economists and political scientists found themselves with a promising new approach , but one in which great gaps existed . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect of the long drought and then the sudden downpour is that new understandings are being advanced so rapidly that there is little chance to absorb them all . This is not , in short , the best time to try the synthetic venture that Dowd attempts here , for the material he wants to bring together has not yet solidified into a consistent approach . As a result , he has to fudge over some important theoretical issues , a tendency which some examples may illustrate . First , Dowd poses some theoretical difficulties which he then proceeds to ignore . Consider this sequence of sentences : ! The decline and fall of the Roman empire has been cited innumerable times by critics of Western society , as though what happened there and then can happen here and now . It can not , because the societies have more differences than similarities . Some of the similarities are nonetheless telling . " The theoretical issue is whether or not one can make historical generalizations . There is much to be said on either side of the argument . But what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is first to say that no generalization 's can be made and then to blithely go about making them . It would not be much of a fault if , this case were an isolated one , but it is not . Is American capitalism more American or more capitalist ? That question , which raises the issue of whether Marxism is an iron law or allows for variations , is avoided in a similar manner , though here Dowd does address the issue in more detail . Will the United States become a Fascist state ? No , says Dowd , it will not , but on the other hand it might . One gets the feeling that in a survey of this sort , it would be better not even to raise questions like these if one can not interrupt the narrative in order to explore them in detail . A second series of theoretical problems is more , conceptual . At one point we are told that " inflation is a political rather than an economic problem , " a brilliant insight which requires further exploration . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationship between them must a radical see ? Here Dowd relies on the conventional distinction made in American universities . Economics is about money and scarcity , politics about power and public policy . At this point , such a distinction is no longer tenable . Marx outlined a theory in which his " economics , " based on the labor theory of value , and his " politics , " based on a theory of the state which was sketched but ( contrary to what Dowd says ) never completed , continuously interacted to the benefit of each . Marx refused to allow others to define for him what those crucial terms meant , and radical thebrists of the present generation must do the same . Dowd must be aware of that , for he says that a labor movement must be " political , in the deepest sense of that term " ? but he does not indicate what that sense is . Followers of a thinker who continually explored the debilitating effects of the division of labor , American Marxists have ironically created such a division among themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , prefer the Marx of Capital , the man who dissected an economic system . The other group , philosophers and political theorists , see another Marx , the Hegelian , who used a philosophical language and addressed himself to problems far removed from what they contemptuously call " positivistic economics . " The point is that Marx himself was in neither of these schools , but a thinker who was both a theoretician and an economic analyst at the same time . Any writer who leans too heavily toward one approach or the other loses something valuable , and Dowd 's book is , in the final analysis , too much by an " economist " and not enough by a " theorist . " What might at first seem abstract and irrelevant questions ( What is politics ? What makes a generalization true ? ) are necessary parts of his enterprise , and should have figured in his book . There is one useful social activity which does not require great theoretical advances , and that is the debunking of existing preconceptions  --  another skill in which Marx excelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His critiques of the notion of the United States as a benevolent world power , of the idea that economic opportunity exists for all , of the assumption that we are in the presence of a neutral state which is the condition for a pluralist paradise , are all good ones , even though they are now familiar . And he writes in an informal style which is ) as rare among economists as it is among most groups who have a vested interest in confusing people . When it comes to summarizing the mess that U.S. capitalism is , one is not likely to find a better written , more thorough summary than his . When it is a question of why that condition exists , Dowd , despite his interest in history , does not Jake us as far as we would like to go . The problem is that the first task is no longer vital ( liberals are now our best critics of liberalism , and capitalists of capitalism ) ? and for that very reason , the second is essential . Radical thinkers in whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , the rapid crumbling of United States capitalism will leave them standing in the same place. , ?
