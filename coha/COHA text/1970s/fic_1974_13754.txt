Three characters . RACHEL , a young woman , the age of a daughter of the middle-aged woman if the middle-aged woman had had children in her early twenties . RUTH , a middle-aged woman . NAOMI , a woman near seventy . They are just three generations . The young woman 's father , the middle-aged woman 's husband , the elderly woman 's son are dying of cancer in rooms close by . The three women have been sharing one another 's grief for the past six months . They have been set apart by the length of their grief , and anyone who watches them does so from a distance . The three women are present at an extended predeath wake made possible by modern science and medical research . There is no ritual , there is not even the empty outline of one , to prescribe how to handle this situation . They are inventing their responses . The women are not filling time . They are obsessed with its passage . Each second brings them closer to the death of the men who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is what happens in their play : First , they tell stories , the same stories they have been telling each other for months . Then , RACHEL returns like a messenger from the sight of the dying . And finally , the three women turn to each other . They ask one another for support and they grow strong together . RUTH I saw the doctor walking down the hall . I thought , my husband has died in the operating room . The doctor walked directly to me and without a word to prepare me said , " The ulcer we were looking for is cancer . " The cancer had already spread from the stomach where it started to the throat , to the small intestine and maybe to the colon . He told me I should let my husband die . It would take three months at most . But at a cancer research hospital he would have a chance for a longer life . I could n't let him die without a fight . He 'd be afraid to die . I decided not to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 3 RACHEL For so long there has been only this routine . Up in the morning . Into the car . Onto the highway . Through these halls . Into his room . The conversation I end up here . These two women and I eat lunch together . I tell Ruth not to take the meat and scold Naomi about the fried foods and the sweets . We eat too much every day and we come away hungry . We who will be mourners make a life for ourselves around the rhythms of their dying . NAOMI The last weekend they let me take him home I made honey cake for him and lentil soup . Favorite foods from when he was a boy . His aunt and uncle came and we drank wine together . I would have lit the candles but I was so busy in the kitchen , I missed the sunset . The three of them were talking in the living room and they forgot . It 's been so long . I consoled myself as I used to console myself when he was young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's washing and mending and cleaning to be done . When the work is shared the Sabbath can be kept . But a woman alone with a growing son keeps the day holy in her heart or not at all . " When I sit with him I pretend he has another fever . I sing to him . A grown man . I sing to him and stroke his forehead . Sitting by his bed I half forget and half expect the fever to break suddenly and his eyes to open clear and out of pain . RACHEL Not long before my father 's operation he came to me . Or maybe I was looking for him there . We were in the front seat of the car , parked in the driveway . He was behind the steering wheel . I was next to him . He took me in his arms and he cried and cried on my shoulder . He held me in his arms and he stroked my hair . He kissed my neck , my ear lobes and my lips . I thought I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to kiss that way unless you were married and it was even worse if the man you wanted was married to your mother . We kissed a long time in the car . We were both crying when we parted.Some of the sadness he faced along with his sickness was that I was growing older and would leave him for another man and part of my anguish is that in his pain he turned from me back to my mother . And soon we 'll be separated for the last time . Without ever having been together we 'll be kept apart forever . p. 4 RUTH My father was a late bloomer . He had never been excited by my mother . But he became excited by me . When I was twelve he began to hug and kiss me in the warmest , most affectionate way . Then , slowly , what he was doing dawned on him . He turned on me with such contempt . He stopped talking to me . He accused me of sins that seemed so vile when he said them . When I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stomach like an animal cowering in the corner of some cage , he would come to me and ask forgiveness.I learned to love like this . One minute I was in the midst of it , the next I was shut off from it like a half-wild creature kept tied outside the door . I met my husband the year my father died . I used to wait outside the window , shivering in the cold , counting the minutes till he came . I waited for him until he told me that he loved me . After we were married he would often wake up crying in the middle of the night and hit his head against the wall and sob until I comforted him . Holding his head against my chest his mouth would find the nipple on my breast.The night before his operation I put my head on his naked stomach . I traced around the mound of flesh with my fingers as it rose and dipped softly into the damp creases of his groin . I said , " Tomorrow your beautiful stomach will be scarred and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from when I bore him children . " Your stomach will be imperfect then like mine . " p. 5 NAOMI My father , who every day thanked god he was not born a woman , naturally wanted a son . Instead god blessed him with a daughter so brutal to her mother during childbirth that the wife could not conceive again . My father 's love turned angry like his god 's . He never spoke except to humble me.When I found out my baby was a boy it was as though my sin had been atoned for . I had never been a blessing but now I had been blessed by love . My husband did n't care about the baby . He would n't look at me or at the child . He would n't touch me . He never picked the baby up . He wanted all my time and when I could n't give it , he sulked.When my husband died my old boss took me back . I did fine stitching work on hats . I sewed most of the night . During the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The nights passed almost without my knowing . He would find me asleep in the chair some mornings and tugging at my arm would get me up to light the fire and make the breakfast , pack his lunch , get him off to school . What a flurry we would make in the kitchen . He would pull on his trousers standing by the stove , hopping from one foot to the other . I would stir the oatmeal over his jumping head . Sweeten it with jam or honey , pour in rich milk . And bread , big slices of black bread with cheese between them , I packed for his lunch . And cookies and some fruit . " Save the bag , " I said . And sometimes he would . RACHEL ( she has come from a visit to her father 's room . ) He is sitting up in a chair with a metal bed table pulled around in front of him like a school desk . He 's working on a puzzle . Last month someone brought him a thousand piece puzzle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given him a new puzzle . He 's sitting in a chair engrossed . Someone has given him a puzzle of a duck . A wooden puzzle with just ten pieces . A duck with a smile on its face . I stood in the door and watched him for a while . He was putting down the pieces one by one , taking a long time to find the shape that fit the space he 'd made . He stopped when I moved closer and looked up at me . He almost remembered who I am , or almost did n't remember . He looked at me as though he thought he knew me and then he looked down at the puzzle piece and then up again at my face in the door . We stayed like that.A minute more we stared . I could see the recognition come across his face . He let go of the piece of the puzzle in his hand and said , " hello , babe . " Said , " hello , babe , " to his daughter . Said , " hello @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the door . The woman who saw that the puzzle piece he had just let go of was not the one that would fit next in place.I thought I might meet him over that puzzle . We could have finished it off together . I could have given him my opinion . His fingers might have picked out the pieces I selected . He 's sitting in a chair propped up by pillows . His anus is too diseased to take his weight directly . His narrow hip bones would scrape against the leatheret . He weighs 98 pounds . There 's not an ounce of flesh left on his frame . The skin on his face is stretched across pure bone.Next to my father 's chair on a stand is the intravenous feeder connected to his left arm by a clear plastic tube . Through that tube drip the fluids that let him continue putting together a wooden puzzle of a duck.The doctors look in hourly to marvel that this obsolete frame is still , technically speaking , in working order . They have hacked out the way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death . Here I am watching my father move down it . What are the words I 'll remember when he 's dead . Here he comes now past own locomotion , past eating , past hunger and voluntary excretion , rounding the corner past mind.He 's living officially . He 's alive according to the fine measurements of our fine scientific establishment.What are the words I 'll remember when he 's dead.The mind has gone away . The light of the eyes has long been out . And the flesh is left alone in a chair . ( Silence . ) He should be dead . p. 6 RUTH ( comes to her . ) Rachel . Be quiet now for awhile . Let the suffering inside you settle . You 'll grow accustomed to the suffering . You 'll learn to wear it like you might wear an old coat . In awhile the covering that seems so heavy to you now will stretch and you 'll be moving free again within it . Time makes all things bearable . RACHEL It does n't help to know that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grief will have grown greater . If it 's so it 's because each grief is one bead on a string upon which other , heavier beads are being strung . RUTH Once you were happy together . There were many times when you were a pleasure to him . Accept it as a mercy that he lived to see you grown . RACHEL Lies from a person who has seen what I 've seen , who knows , or might know , what I know . RUTH My husband is terrified of dying . He wants to go on living . RACHEL It 's exactly what he wants that he 's not getting . RUTH When he shakes in my arms what do you want me to answer ? " Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death , I will fear no evil : for thou art with me : thy rod and thy staff comfort me . " As I read him the words of the Bible I also begin to tremble . p. 7 NAOMI ( chants in Hebrew . ) Shema Israel/Adoni eloeinou/ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our God/The Lord is One . ) RACHEL Naomi , as much as your son needed you when he was young , I need you now . Or more than that . When he was a baby sucking at your breast . No . More . When he was a fetus breathing your blood , taking his form from your flesh . I need you that much . I give up my father as I have to . Come with me now . Give up your son since you must , but do n't give up your struggling daughters . NAOMI My son is the only one I ever cared for . RACHEL And who will you care for when he 's dead . NAOMI He 's still dying . What gives you the right RACHEL I take the right because my father 's dying faster . I 'm a woman and I 'm good at suffering silently . But I have not been good at living . And now think how out of my fear , I have become good at killing . Because I stand and watch his torture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is evil in not doing and I feel that evil alive inside myself . I feel it growing in me like a poison vine that winds around the healthy stalk . I am burdened by a parasite so ugly yet so well-disguised it feeds off my will without my knowing ; it has filled itself off my hunger . p. 8 NAOMI You blame yourself too much and then unable to bear it by yourself you blame us . Accept that things can not be other than they are . However you explain it , they would still be dying and we would still be staring at it : daughter to father , wife to husband , mother to son . RACHEL We are just shadows of ourselves and they in their deathbeds are shadows of shadows . Men without muscles , without wills , without minds . Unable to talk , to reason , to imagine . Not shadows even , but dark spots . Dark spots left on life . NAOMI I 'm an old woman and I see my only son is dying . I need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass . I ca n't consider what could have been . I 'm an old woman and I 've prayed to god to end my life instead of his . But with every pain he suffers I am stronger . Every time he cries my determination grows . The joke of motherhood . When her child needs her , she endures . Joke again . The child never feels more bandoned , never turns against her with more bitter rage than he does now , watching his own mother watch him die . RACHEL You should n't have to feel your grief alone for then the will to prolong it strengthens . If grief is all I know of life I can not help hold onto grief . Until it seems impossible to end the grief by ending the hold on me of the one who makes me grieve . Ending it I would be left without it , I do n't know who I am. p. 9 NAOMI My life is almost over . I can not question it the way you do . My life is a pattern and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a pattern in the cloth itself . Not a fashion that can be put on or taken off at will . One does n't change the way the threads have come together without unraveling the entire piece of cloth . I understand what you are saying , I ca n't participate . I ca n't continue to exist if everything is taken from me . RACHEL The pattern that you make extends its shape from you through Ruth to me . I know I have the right to change it in my life . Do I have that right still if changing my life demands that you change yours . NAOMI Let me be . Let me spend my energy mothering my dying son . The thought sounds strange to me even as I say it . Of all a mother 's functions my son 's illness has already fully stripped me . My son moans in his bed . He moans from deep inside his throat . " How do you feel , " I ask him . Drugged , he feels nothing except he has been betrayed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could I have known it . How could I have born the hardship of his early years and education if I had thought there was this one lesson I should teach him . I did n't bring him up to watch him die . What mother does this ? RACHEL Some must have . Why do some people but not others put on their finest qualities like brilliant colors and flaunt their living beauty in the face of death ? p. 10 RUTH One of you is old , the other young . One 's life is nearly over , the other 's just begun . But I 'm in the middle of my life . Who am I if I 'm not my husband 's wife ? My children have grown up and gone away . My husband 's dying : And I who thought I had a position , have none . Once he 's dead I might as well never have existed . I 'm nothing . Who am I ? RACHEL Fear of death keeps him living . Fear of life keeps you clinging to him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a frightening occupation . But remember , you made children from the center of you where eating , feeling , loving are united . Find the healthy breath inside you that allows you to still his heavy breathing . Take life for yourself from the one who is dying . RUTH I ca n't do it . If I did it it would be murder . It must happen slowly and I must show grief openly . Do n't push me . A man is dying who has hit me , who has called me whore , who has ridiculed me before my children , and convinced me I am nothing . The same man who sought my bed and showed off my stylish beauty to his friends . RACHEL Letting him live wo n't quiet the wish to kill inside you . But there 's a human limit to hate , the limit love puts on it . Love is a changing emotion and they are past changing . Everyday they are less than they were . So we let them go for love 's sake or we let ourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dying had a body whose love I wanted and whose love I thought I needed . For love 's sake I waited while he came into me from behind and I buried my face in the folds of the pillow and clawed the varnished bedstead . For lack of his love I 've run screaming from the room . I 've thrown plates of food on the floor and crawled after every crumb while he sat tipped back in his chair . I 've put my hand through the storm door and walked barefoot on broken glass . Locked myself in the bathroom and spit up blood , straining to hear someone 's step in the hall . I 've apologized for everything I 've ever done . NAOMI Ruth , the cycle can not end unless we end it . My son will die a better death if you reach out to me . RUTH I 'm the one between you . I must find my strength from my unhappy place in time . What has been passed down has been passed through me . So I can also pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll receive it and return it modified with age . We three . Three generations . We are all the firsthand knowledge nature lets us have of what 's before , what 's to come . Past , present , future , embodied by us three . Now we exchange it . RACHEL We 'll go down the hall together and take the intravenous needle from his arm . I 'll hold his hand and watch his passage . p. 12 RUTH Then we 'll go on to my husband . I 'll hold his hand and watch his passage . NAOMI And we 'll come to my son at the end of the hall . I 'll hold his hand and watch his passage . RUTH We plan their deaths together but we stand alone when we stand for the last time in the gaze of son , husband , father . Lonely twice over . Lonely from our need to be alone . Lonely , too , as the murderer is lonely . It is still murder we commit in just a minute . We three women do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be done . We will put our hands around the plastic tube and pull the intravenous eedle slowly from the swollen arm . And tomorrow and the next day and the next day we will be without this person 's presence . RACHEL My will grows outward toward my body . The thought steps forward and the human act takes shape . My father 's sickness worked the life force in reverse . The will was absent first , then the body shriveled . And the memory of the man who lived there  --  empty . When I let him die it 's the emptiness I murder . ( RUTH 'S wail is heard ; she has done it . ) NAOMI Now we are alone . Alone with our lament . Left alone by our own hands with our sorrow.The three women ( RUTH returns . NAOMI acts . The chant continues . NAOMI returns . RACHEL acts . The chant continues . It is done . The three women lament together . Their lament is a song . It passes through all shades of grief and brave exaltation. ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
