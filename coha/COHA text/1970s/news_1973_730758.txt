txt The Nixon administration is groping for ways  --  to slow down runaway inflation , as bad news continues to pile up for American consumers . Since the beginning of the year , consumer prices have risen at an annual rate of 8.8 percent , compared with 3.4 percent for all of 1972 . And now Herbert Stein , chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers ( CEA ) , says " tax increases " are being considered as one way to drain some steam from the overheated U.S. economy . This is a new departure , for until now President Nixon has insisted that his economic policy , coupled with federal budgetary restraint , would preclude higher taxes . Clearly a concerned White House believes something must be done to preserve cred ? ibility with consumers , beset by sky rocketing prices since the President lifted the lid on mandatory controls Jan. 11 . Hopes wiped out Dr. Stein concedes that the explosive infation of the first quarter of 1973 wipes out earlier CEA hopes of achieving an overall 3 percent infation for the current year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will lose ground , even if their wage earners receive the annual 5.5 percent pay increase Mr. Nixon 's guideline allows . The White House says the guideline stands ? must stand if inflation is not be further fueled by a wage-price spiral . Anxiety about rising prices is causing Americans to splurge on consumer buying ? snapping up new cars , color TV sets , and even houses , apparently in anticipation that prices are going to climb even more . This is unusual , declares the University of Michigan 's Survey Research Center . Ordinarily , says the center , an inflationary period causes consumers to " reduce their spending and increase their saving . " // *Taxes loom to curb inflation in overheated U.S. economy // " The present approval of buying in advance , " adds the center , " suggests that confidence ? in the dollar has been badly shaken in recent months . " Personal spending by Americans , reports Dr. Stein , rose at an annual rate of 16 percent during the first quarter of 1973 , following a 9.5 percent rise in 1972 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , suggested Dr. Stein , might be one way of cooling off demand . Another possibility being discussed in Washington , but not specifically mentioned by Dr. Stein , is a temporary surcharge on personal and corporate income taxes , to scoop off excess purchasing power . The CEA chief ruled out , meanwhile , a new price freeze or reimposition of across-the-board wage and price controls , such as prevailed during Phase 2 of the President 's new economic policy . Steps considered The administration , indicated Dr. Stein , is considering ways to make the " voluntary " Phase-3tougherwithout restoring to blanket controls . All these ideas , says Dr. Stein , are being considered , with no decisions taken . The White House , he added , still expects budgetary restraint ? a proposed $268.7 billion spending ceiling for fiscal 1974 ? plus a tighter credit policy by the Federal Reserve Board , will act to slow inflation by the latter part of the year . This does little , however , to calm the growing fear of many Americans that inflation will continue to bite into their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this year . The Agriculture Department , for example , reported the cost of enough U.S.-grown food to feed a theoretical family of 3.2 for a year rose $49 in March , after earlier steep increases in January and February . It now costs this theoretical family , says the department , $1,458 to feed itself for a year ? $157 more than a year ago . Grocery prices Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner . By R.

Soaring retail prices , led by food , had created strong pressure in Congress to legislate some form of price controls to replace Phase 3 . In the end , however , the House voted to give Mr. Nixon his requested simple extension of control authority for one year , to April 30 , 1974 . Similar action by the Senate is expected this April 30 , the day the President 's current authority expires . Rep. Wilbur D.
