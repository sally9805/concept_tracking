 | WOMEN 'S LIB BACKLASH Some women fear the feminine liberation movement while others are just happy at home with the kids From the beginning , some men feared and hated the Women 's Liberation movement . That was to be expected . What 's surprising is the number of women who feel the same way . How has it happened that a movement designed to free women for a wider life , to raise their consciousness and build their self-esteem , has seemed to so many women a gigantic put-down ? Today , for instance , my mail contains a letter from a devoted mother of five . " In spite of the common cartoon image of the average homemaker glued to the TV , " she writes , " I work all day at my job . I take pride in keeping my house not only clean but beautiful . Our family is caught up in the celebration of every season and holiday . I cook ' real ' meals rich in nutrition and flavor . I do the research necessary so that my family can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Easter . I pass along to them their rich Italian heritage ? songs I remember from my own childhood , stories I was told . I plan our vacations carefully . Yet liberated women keep asking me , ' Are n't you working yet ? ' What do they think I 've been doing these past 18 years ? " SOME DEMANDS SUPPORTED Surveys show that most American women support the central demands of the liberation movement : equal pay for equal work , fair hiring and promotion practices , an end to the many legal discriminations against women . But many resent the movement 's rejection of homemaking as an appropriate and fulfilling female role . " That get-in-there-and-fight talk is fine for a professionally qualified woman , " a friend said to me recently . " It does n't mean much to someone who has no salable skills and who 's really happy at home with the kids . " Though officially the Women 's Lib platform supports the freedom of women to do whatever they choose , prominent liberationists often speak as if those who choose to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insist they are neither are told they 've been so brainwashed by society that they do n't even realize how they 're being exploited . Is it any wonder that the response is anger ? Of course the backlash is not really new . It 's been there all along . In the beginning , though , it was the flamboyant reformers who caught the public eye and the TV cameras . Now that the first excitements are over ? the parades and strikes and tales 1 ! bra-burning ( which never really : c curred anywhere ) ? the news media has turned its attention to a silent majority that 's just now finding t voice . And they 've discovered that for every woman who renounces men -- and-marriage there are many more who say , as did a respondent in a consumer poll : " As a housewife and mother , I would rather be a feminine woman than a woman feminist . " WHO ARE OPPOSED ? The opposition to Women 's L does n't all come from aggrieved homemakers . Some people are , quite simply , put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Betty Friedan , an intelligent and dedicated champion of women . does n't exactly melt the heart . Nor do you have to be a shrinking violet to shrink a little at the image of Jill Johnson leaping topless into a pool at an elegant public gathering , or of Kate Millett in karate garb . Then there are those spokeswomen who describe childbearing as humiliating slavery , and heterosexual love as a form of rape . In defense of the bizarre exhibitionism of some women 's libbers , it 's worth pointing out that without just this sort of excess , no one would have paid much attention to demands for women 's equality . " Typical " women do n't make news . Whatever the justification for the movement 's histrionics. though , a great many women simply can not identify with Gloria Steinem and Germaine Greer . ( And no doubt at least some resent these glamorous creatures for their almost incredible combinations of brains , beauty and success . ) Though there 's surprising agreement on women 's rights to job equality continued on page 56 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ platform are by no means universally supported . Abortion is a hotly disputed , emotionally charged issue ; so are day-care centers , since some women ( as well as men ) fear they will ultimately contribute to child neglect and the further decline of family life . Conservative women are repelled by the movement 's association with Gay Liberation , to say nothing of its implied endorsement of bisexuality . The proposed designation of Ms. for all women gets a cold eye from many . ( " I like Mrs. , " Mayor John Lindsay 's wife said recently . " It took me long enough to get it . " ) As for cosmetics , perfumes and bras , abhorred by militant libbers because they 're part of the sex-object mentality ? how a woman feels in this area is likely to be determined by her natural endowments . I like the realism of the woman who , asked about giving up her bra , shrugged , " That 's fine if you 're a 30AAA . But what about us 36D 's ? " The message from Women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No more man-the-master , no more woman-on-a-pedestal , no more **25;1047;TOOLONG and **25;1074;TOOLONG . It 's clear , though , that not all females have rallied to this cry . Maybe it is the result of brainwashing , but a lot of women do n't want to restructure . They enjoy having doors opened for them . And I 'm not thinking only of super-frillies like the members of the anti-lib organization , Pussycats ( motto : " The lamb chop is mightier than the karate chop " ) . Even women who 've made it in a man 's world , successful career types , are just as likely to expect that their coats will be held and their cigarettes lit . And some ardent feminists themselves may be inconsistent . A national poll last year found that while a majority of women under 25 did n't want to be " treated as sex objects , " an even larger majority enjoyed being whistled at ! And while most women of all ages opposed discrimination in hiring , nearly all were against women being drafted into the armed services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well by either men or women . Some of what 's called " backlash " against Women 's Lib is more properl. described as indifference . Basically the movement speaks to white , middle-class Americans . It has little relevance for blacks of any class their experience is too separate . " The Women 's Liberation movement , " says Ida Lewis , former editor of Essence " is basically a family quarrel between - white women and white men . And or general principles , it 's not good to get involved in family disputes . The role of black women is to continue the struggle in concert with black men for the liberation and self-determination of blacks . " Women 's Lib also says little to a woman who , for instance , left school after the eighth grade and now lives on welfare with her family . Even the movement 's natural constituency , educated urbar or suburban women , often remains aloof ? for the most elementary human reason : Caught up in the concrete problems of daily life ( jobs , cooking , pregnancies , whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vividly aware that a point-by-point marriage contract would n't help them " solve the current crisis of a broken dishwasher or the baby-sitter who did n't show . Other reasons for the backlash can be dismissed briefly . There 's the professional woman who says , " I made it on my own . Why ca n't other women do the same ? " ( To movement leaders . she 's an Aunt Tom . ) There 's the woman who really is n't interested in anything except having fun ( So what on earth are they yammering about , all those neurotic females hung up on achievement ? ) . There 's the sourgrapes type ( It 's too late for me to be liberated , so why should those others get all the advantages ? ) . But probably the most interesting opposition to the movement is the result of what psychologists call " reaction formation . " In plain language . this is an individual 's attempt to protect himself against unacceptable impulses by going to the opposite extreme . So , the mother who feels resentment toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become overfriendly ? and the woman who , deep down , smoulders over her housewife role continued on page 58  | may attack the liberation because it speaks to her su desires . Reading about those pated wives who leave husba children in order to find th selves , she feels a dispropo fury . Hussies , sluts , tramps , a disgrace to womanhood . . . louder she rages , the less she that small , uneasy-making voice : " I 'd like to do that too ! " A woman who finds herself sonably upset by Women 's Libe would do well to attempt an h self-appraisal . What is it in her that makes the movement 's de so galling ? Such probing can be ful but productive . If , having sen explored her feelings , she can she 's a housewife by free choice , cause homemaking satisfies her d est needs , then she has no rea to feel apologetic or threatened . the same token , she has no reason remind her family of sacrifices m for their sake ? or to expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-examination does produce such reassuring results ? What if a woman feels , frankly , that s would have made a better chemist than cook , a happier businesswoman ' than baby-sitter ? Coming to such a conclusion hurts . It takes courage But it can be constructive too , for only by facing up to real feelings can one deal with them effectively . A woman who realizes that she 's beer pushing the lid down on a kettlefu of boiling discontents can be helped . by Women 's Lib , to come to terms with these feelings and work out a happier compromise . Women 's Lib is , like most things human , a mixed bag ? a combination of lofty rhetoric and petty complaints , of reason and illogic , idealism and sheer vindictiveness . But what it 's really talking about is free choice : freedom to take a job and freedom to stay home , freedom for women to fulfill themselves and equal freedom for men . The consciousness-raising it advocates can lead to new self-confidence , making women aware of the choices they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it urges that people respect each other as individuals , not as symbols . In the tumult and shouting , this message sometimes gets overlooked . @#
