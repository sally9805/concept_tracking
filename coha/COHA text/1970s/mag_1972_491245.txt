My husband has been in six accidents since 1963 . In all but one he was drunk and responsible and he was never arrested or given a drunk-driver test . . . . 1 live in mortal fear that he will kill or maim someone . I have pleaded with my husband to seek help but so far he has re-'Used . We have four small children and while I have contemplated leaving him many times because his drinking not only affected his driving but also his family life ( or lack of it I guess I am a coward , . . . Since I have to be both mother and father now , 1 do n't see how 1 could manage to work full-time and still give the children the attention they need and deserve . Someone has to see and do something about situations such as mine , and 1 sincerely hope that your article meets with great success in solving some of these problems . The anguish was clear . The urgency was real . In the days and weeks after " The Killer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of The Saturday Evening Post , thousands of such letters poured into the offices of the Post . They were a response to one of the great tragedies of our times : the personal tragedy of excessive drinking and the public tragedy of the drunk-driving toll-the 30,000 or more people killed and 800,000 persons injured in alcohol-related accidents every year . They were more than that . They were a recognition of the new insights that research has given us about drunk driving-most notably that the killer drunk is not the occasional or social drinker ; he 's a chronic drinker , frequently a confirmed alcoholic whose behavior is destructive of self and family as well as of the accident victim . They were also a cry-wounded , deep , almost atavistic- that something drastic be done about the killer-drunk : " After all , " wrote one agitated reader , " they used to hang horse thieves ! " The very passion of the messages reflects the insistent clamor that action must be taken-nowto curb the killer drunk . The range of concern and of potential action is suggested in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his daughter were killed by a drunken driver , " wrote Mrs. Florence M. Rees of Waitsburg , Washington . " I want to see people afraid to drink and to drive . " - " Somewhere I read of a community where first offenders ( after being sobered up , of course ) were made to sit through movies taken from real life of horrible accidents , " Mrs. Carl Hounsell of Conway , New Hampshire , wrote . " Perhaps shock value works . " - " I believe that a drunk who kills with an auto should be tried for murder , not just manslaughter , " D. Bryce Warne wrote from Midland . Texas . " I believe that our courts are just not strong enough . Our society too easily forgives the drunk . " - " Change the laws to make the charge second-degree murder when a drunken driver is involved in a fatal accident . Or aggravated battery if anyone is injured . With no parole , " suggested J. H. Kloppenbu rg of Dolton , Illinois . - " Being an insurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be given to the drunk driver , including confiscation of the car tags and car , if necessary , followed by a jail sentence if the offense is repeated even once more , " said Mrs. John Ray Harper of Victoria , Texas . - " All first offenses might require the offenders to work out a fine at some public service job , " wrote Gilbert I. Beckwith of Seattle , Washington . " Repeaters must not be allowed to drive until they can show clear evidence they have kicked the habit . " - " Public listing of all driving offenses and mandatory reporting of all drunk driving arrests , regardless of conviction , into a nationwide computer bank for use by police and insurance companies , " C. L. Cotton of Columbus , Ohio , proposed . - " Establish treatment centers ... that help the drunk person discover what his problem is and how he can solve it , " wrote Janice Rosenberg of Philadelphia , Pennsylvania . " Before treatment , get the drunken driver out of his car and off the road . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a coronary . fearing I might possibly have an accident , " " stated Catherine V. Ogilvie of Denver , Colorado , offering an example of what the person afflicted with another disease , alcoholism , might do . - " I believe that the penalties for drunk driving should be the same as our laws against any violence , " William P. Snyder of New York City wrote . // Londa L. Anderson : Dayton , Nevada : " As a coroner who has seen the tragic aftermaths of drunken driving , I have devised an auto-confiscation plan . Provide a parking area in a prominent downtown location and adequately label it ' Drunk Driver Penalty Parking : Place in front of each vehicle a sign giving the drunk driver 's name and record of offenses . All drivers arrested for drunken driving should have their automobiles impounded in this lot open to public view for a determined amount of time and should be charged a daily storage fee . I would hope that the stigma , inconvenience , and exposure would bring results . " " A driver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weapon who threatens injury or life . " ? " Whatever the laws , and however enforced , the courts must convict quickly  --  within ten days , " wrote Paul Creasman of Charlotte , North Carolina . " A few jail sentences and auto confiscations will have more persons taking cabs , and more clubs offering ' party wagon ' service ? ' The concern of these and other individuals stirred one major American corporation to prompt and early action . The Allstate Insurance Company invested more than $1 million in an anti-drunkdriving advertising campaign ( One of the next 50 drivers you pass will be drunk ) , despite warnings that it might have to sustain a loss of a million customers  --  people who resented being told the sobering facts of a problem that strikes too close to home . Judson B. Branch , chairman of the board of Allstate , announced that the company would not back away from the intended campaign , concluding that " We feel an insurance company must have a civilizing impulse as well as a financial one . " The potential loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profits and pride from the campaign . Shortly afterward , other major insurance companies  --  including State Farm Mutual , Continental , Insurance Company of North America  --  joined in the drunk-driving fight . The result was the beginning of a national awareness and a governmental response . The seventeen remainingstates that did not have an " implied consent " law passed one . ( Such a law provides that anyone holding a driver 's license gives his consent , by implication , to being tested for drunk driving under appropriate circumstances . ) Further , fifteen states established a " presumptive level " of drunkenness . which specifies .10 as the amount of alcohol in the bloodstream needed for one to be declared legally drunk . ( Utah and Idaho have placed the level at .08 percent , an even safer limit . ) Passage of the " presumptive-level " law in those several states could possibly affect thousands of lives . A person whose blood-alcohol is at .10 percent is six times as likely to be in an accident as a driver who has not been drinking . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driving in the decade ahead may well be considerable . All of these efforts to curb drunk driving in America reflect an imperative that is rooted in logic as well as in tragedy . In Chicago , during the past Christmas holiday season , a radio campaign was mounted against the problem . One of the testimonials came from a man who told in sober tones Catherine F. Ogilvie : Denver , Colorado : " Two of my friends were killed in accidents caused by drunk drivers , and I feel that no punishment is too severe for those who are potential killers due to drinking . Confiscation of all cars likely to cause fatalities would seem to me a small price to pay to avoid more deaths or injuries . However , the law would have to he forcefully and unequivocally enforced , with no loopholes . In addition , alcoholism should be made a reportable disease and the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles should have absolute authority to limit anyone 's right to drive . " how he had run down and killed an eleven-year-old boy several Christmases ago . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concluded sadly , " but I can see him every day now . " A similar testimony was sent to the Post by a thirty-nine-year-old reformed alco-holic : " I am an alcoholic who has been cured of drinking . I 've lived your article , so please believe me when can only say'There but for the grace of God go I. ' " The writer then went on to propose a nutnber of changes and possible campaigns to decrease the number of drunk drivers . One was what he termed a ' Kindness Approach . ' linked to public transportation means : Use a taxi . Take a bus . Their drivers want to help you live longer . Other letters received by the editors of the Post reveal the many tragedies caused by drunk driving . A few excerpts :  - -  My young son was killed in an automobile accident due to a man who was so drunk he could n't stand on his feet , " wrote a mother from Silver Spring , Maryland . " As usual , the drunken driver received only a scratched chin . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who caused the accident was let off scot-free because he had children to support . " ? " My father-in-law was killed by a drunk who dragged the body a mile and a half and still did n't know he had hit anything . " a man in Columbus , Ohio . wrote . " We had a head-on collision with a drunk neker school . The results : 87 percent felt t hat the Banneker program should be continued ; 84 percent thought their children had made greater improvement in this year than their last in math , and 79 percent saw the same kind of improvement in reading . In addition , 7I percent of the parents noted that their children read more at home and 79 percent suggested that their children talked more about school . Seventy-eight percent indicated that their children clearly liked school more . How did this measure up to the money-back guarantee ? BRL said that it would run the school as economically as any other school in the Gary system-and that it would expect to be paid on the basis of what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student at Banneker in this first school year ran to just over $830 . The cost for the entire school system was an average of $924 . That means that the Banneker school was run at an average rate of $96 a student less than in the rest of the system , or roughly 10 percent less than the rest of the system . " If we turned the school back to Gary right now , " said Dr. Fitch last December , " I think we could show them how they could save as much as 15 percent on its operations . " This , as it happens , is the ultimate goal : BRL is working on a three-year contract at Banneker school and its aim is to turn the school back to the city of Gary with all systems intact . It is not ambitious to take over more and more schools in Gary or anyplace else ; it wants merely to demonstrate that there are more effective ways of teaching than the present public-school syndrome permits . Beyond all this , the figures on the contract are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was paid $662,982.08 . This was $74,689,12 less than it would have been paid if every student gained in reading and math as fast as he could have gained . BRL had , at that point , two more years in which to establish its ability to bring even more students up to a national reading level , most particularly those in the highest-sixth grade . In those two years , BRL is hoping to find how best to improve the system so that not only the concept of failure is gone but so also is the stigma of an " F " record where an " S " should have been . For the grades in the school are not defeating , but explicit : either the child at Banneker meets the criteria of 100 percent-for " satisfactory " - or the school finds out why . Within itself . M driver whose wife had earlier reported to the police that he had been drunk for three days and that they should pick him up before he hurt himself or someone else , " wrote a woman doctor in the Far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't pick him up until he had done something besides being drunk . And so he did ! " What he did , the letter goes on to sadly recount , was crash head-on into the doctor 's car , critically injuring both the woman and her husband . The drunk driver was taken to the hospital and placed under police guard so that he would not escape . " How much better it would have been to guard him before he got into his car , " wrote the doctor . " Something is certainly wrong with our laws affecting drunk drivers ... ! ' ' Some of the biggest tragedies involve those who were able to save themselves from drinking , only to later die at the hands of another drunk driver . The story of a man we shall call Gordon Mallory is an example . A once-successful businessman with a happy family , Gordon began drinking so heavily that eventually his company went to ruin , his family to despair , his neighbors to contempt . After a time Gordon wound up on skid row where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In one of those moments of revelation , he staggered into an experience that aroused an old knowledge and a dormant hope . He was led to Alcoholics Anonymous and a new life . He dried out , regained his old sense of purpose , and decided to rebuild . He went to another town , got his family to join him , and did n't take a drink for five years . One night while on his way home from an AA meeting , he was blinded by the lights of another car coming at him head-on . He wrenched the wheel reflexively to get out of the way . It was all he knew before he knew nothing . The next morning , all his friends , old and new , read of his death . Some of his aid ones wondered if he had been drinking . All of his new ones knew he had not . But soon they all came to know the last and most terrible irony of Gordon Mallory 's life and death : the driver of the car that killed him was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The disturbing depth of such tragedies reflects the scope and amplitude of their cause . There are an estimated nine million alcoholics in the United States today . Some seven million of them are driving regularly . They pose a multi-faceted problem . " While the ' drunk ' might be considered ' sick , ' says Benjamin 0 . Davis , assistant secretary of the Department of Transportation , " the minute he gets behind the wheel of a car , he becomes a different person . He becomes a criminal . " What can be done to curb that criminal ? " Confiscate the car ! " wrote a man in Cleveland , Ohio . " Take away his car until he 's stopped drinking , " urged a reader in Galesburg , Illinois . " A potential murderer is little more than a wild animal , " wrote a man in Union City , Tennessee . " Should n't his claws be removed ? " This was the feeling of the vast majority of readers who responded to the poll accompanying " The Killer Drunk " in The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " yes " under the question : " Is confiscation of the automobile an appropriate penalty for the drunk driver who repeatedly drives with blood-alcohol levels far beyond the legal limit ? " The idea is finding a response in many quarters . In Indiana , the state legislature is being exposed to a proposal that would establish a Memorial Day Moratorium on death-bydrunk . The proposal provides not only for screening out of drunk drivers on that holiday weekend but insists on the immediate impoundment  --  and ultimate confiscation-of the car of anybody found to be driving with a blood-alcohol concentration of .15 percent or higher . If that proves successful in reducing the drunk-driver toll , the idea might he extended to all other holidays during the year . " We might even suggest using the money from the confiscated automobiles to rehabilitate alcoholics , " says one supporter of the idea . The federal government is moving slowly in the same direction . The U.S. Department of Transportation has quietly drafted recommendations that laws be passed that would include-among other things-impoundment or confiscation of cars driven by drunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that means the authorities would keep the car in custody for a certain length of time-say a year-before returning it to its owner . Confiscation would come on the third offense ; that means the car would not only be seized but sold and the income from the sale would he used for the public treasury . ( The Department of Transportation is also suggesting that the income be used for the rehabilitation of alcoholics . Up until recently , the federal government 's investment in the treatment of alcoholism has been an estimated $4 million a year , compared to the estimated $8.2 billion a year that all levels of government-local , state and federal-receive in taxes from the sale of alcoholic beverages . ) What if the drunk borrowed or rented the car ? The DOT proposal takes that into account . It urges that the car be impounded or confiscated even if it 's owned by somebody other than the continued from page 134 drunk driver- if the owner knew that the driver was intoxicated . That would prevent the confirmed alcoholic from borrowing a car from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nor would the drunk escape penalty because somebody else lost possession of the car he 's found driving . The DOT proposals also provide that the drunk driver be hit with fines ( up to $1,000 ) , imprisonment ( up to a year ) , and revocation of the driver 's license ( for one to five years ) . Though it may seem to many that seizure of private property is unconstitutional , the practice has many precedents in American life . On the federal level , agents of the Treasury or Justice departments are authorized to seize cars , money , whiskey , cigarettes , guns , birds , flowers , boats , jewelry - " anyt hing that is used in a crime against the United States , " The methods and motives vary . Whiskey and cigarettes and guns can he seized as contraband , along with the boats or cars they 're being transported in . Jewels , cameras . archaeological artifacts , drugs , anything that is being smuggled into the United States can also be seized . In fact , certain property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ openly and without a premeditated attempt at crime : Customs Agents can seize birds , food , fruit , vegetables , seeds , almost anything living that is being brought in from a foreign land if those items are a menace to the health of people in the United States . There is no appeal from this seizure . In certain circumstances , the government can seize money . One such case is in payment of back taxes : the tax men often seize property , money , or a bank account in payment of a tax due . Another case is when the money seized has been used to bribe an official of the United States . Still another case was certified under the Organized Crime Act of 1970 : the government can seize certain money if it can prove that the cash was to be used to finance the operation of organized crime in the nation . The powers of the government in such seizures are quite broad . Agents of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs can seize cars used in the transportation of illegal drugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drugs at the time of seizure . " Even if it 's two or three months after we 've observed the car being used for trafficking in illegal drugs , we can go out and take possession of that car , " one BNDD agent told me . What if the car is sold or given to another person in the meantime ? " We can seize it from the party that 's holding it . " In most cases , the car is seized as part of the chain of evidence in a case built against narcotics violators . But the power of the BNDD - sometimes called the toughest U.S. agents now at work goes beyond using the car as evidence . They also used the seized cars to track down more criminal violators ( instead of asking for money to buy more new cars as the need for narcotics investigations rises ) . The BNDD uses two methods to legitimatize the seizure . An administrative method is employed for cars whose value is under $2,500 ( " We get three independent appraisals to determine its value " ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but usually a hearing before a U.S. Commissioner-a quasi-judicial move that is not strictly a court case . If the vehicle is worth more than $2,500 , the government petitions the court to confiscate the car . In some cases , the form of the action is a suit against the vehicle- " The United States vs. a 1967 Buick , " for example . The owner of the seized property can , of course , go to court and sue to get his property hack . But the effort is not often successful . And with some property , it is certain to fail . " If you 've been caught hauling machine guns across the country , there 's no way the government is going to give them back to you , " one Justice Department investigator told me . Similarly in narcotics cases : " If you 're caught with a million dollars worth of heroin and the case against you is lost in the courts because of a faulty search warrant , there 's no way you 're going to get that heroin hack . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private property , particularly when they are used in crimes against the state . Usually these crimes must be formidable felonies but in many areas they can be nothing more than violating the hunting laws : game wardens are usually empowered to seize the guns of such hunters and keep them for disposition by the court or other authority . " In fact , confiscation is a ' new ' concept only when it is applied to highway and traffic offenses , " says Robert Duval , assistant director of the Virginia Highway Safety Division . It was Virginia that took the lead in applying the concept of confiscation to driving offenses . In 1962 , the state passed a law providing for the confiscation of vehicles driven by persons whose drivers ' licenses have been suspended or revoked . The law has proven enormously successful in retarding drunk driving , and credit for passing the bill must go to a number of state legislators whose foresight and initiative were a decade ahead of their counterparts in other states . The suspension-or revocation-law covers a number of offenses , including drunken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that as many as two-thirds of the persons who lose their licenses for drunk driving go back to driving-while drunk  - -  without a license . How does Virginia enforce the law ? When a police officer finds that the driver of a car he 's stopped has had his license suspended or revoked , the officer can drive the car to the nearest jail-or ask to have it towed or driven by deputies-and delivered into the custody of the sheriff . The driver is also taken into custody but he can post bond and win his release until his trial . his car can not be released until the court disposes of the matter . The court procedures involve two events : the charge against the driver and the disposal of the auto he was driving . " They are two separate procedures legally , though the same testimony is usually used for both , " says Bob Duval . And both decisions customarily flow from the court in close sequence ; they are not separated in fact so much as in theory . In the legal action involving the car , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a convicted driver to be confiscated and sold at auction . But it will consider mitigating circumstances . Does the car belong to the person who was driving without a license ? If not , was the other-ownership real or a guise ? ( A good many persons with chronic driving problems-such as confirmed drunks-register the car in their wife 's name , hoping that the courts will allow the wife to escape the penalty that would be visited upon the drunk . ) If it 's a guise , the court may order that the car be confiscated and sold anyway , no matter who the registered owner is . Another issue : if the other party genuinely owned the car but let the convicted driver take it anyway-knowing that the individual 's license had been revoked then the court may still insist that the car be confiscated and sold . But if some other party genuinely owned the car and genuinely did n't know it was being driven by an unlicensed driver , then the courts may order the car returned to its proper owner . Thus the court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driver 's own needs : some chronic drinkers will impulsively take their wife 's car without her knowledge and rush out to get a bottle or a drink , even though they do n't have a license to drive , In such cases , the court is likely to ask for proof that an individual is an innocent victim . " One convincing bit of evidence that the wife of an alcoholic can file , " I was told by a man who worked on the original bill , " is a report that the car was stolen , made to the police before the driver is arrested for driving without a license . " This , of course , adds a felony to the charges made against the person found driving a car . It is a clear , even desperate act , but for t he wife of an alcoholic who has assumed the economic burden of the family , it is sometimes the only way of preserving the mobility she needs to support her children . And to inhibit her husband from taking the car to fulfill his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court orders confiscation of the car-what then ? The car is sold at auction by the local sheriff . Any net income received for the car is delivered into the state 's literary fund , to help spread the literacy and reading horizons of the children of Virginia . If the car has been purchased on credit , the money received at auction is delivered to the finance company so that the debt can be paid off . In the last year , some 4,000 cars were processed through the highway-confiscation system in Virginia . Nobody knows how many of them were driven by drunks . For the law is aimed at all flagrant violators of the traffic laws , not just drunk drivers . ( In 1970 it was extended to include habitual offenders : those who 've committed a series of minor offenses or who 've committed three major offenses in a ten-year period ; drunk driving , reckless driving , hit-and-run , or gotten into an accident involving personal injury . ) But the law strikes at drunk drivers in a number of ways . One is through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times for driving while drunk , his car can be confiscated . But frequently , in most cities and states in the nation , a drunk-driving charge will be reduced to reckless driving . In Virginia , that charge counts against him , too , in building up to confiscation of the car . Similarly with an accident involving personal injury : it may have been related to drinking but the driver may have escaped a drunk-driving charge . In Virginia , that personal-injury accident builds up the count against him as an habitual offender and reduces the chance that he 'll escape car confiscation if he 's caught on drunk-driving charges later on . The other way the law strikes at drunk drivers is through the revocation-of-license clause . For in Virginia , the drunk driver suffers , in addition to various fines and threats of jail , the loss of his license for a year on the first conviction , for three years on the second one and for a lifetime on the third one . Therefore , a chronic drinker who drives is very likely to find himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and if he continues driving after that , he 's going to lose the family car . Thus if he can not separate himself from his drink , he will be separated forcibly from his car . In applying the laws of confiscation directly to drunk driving  --  instead of driving with a license suspended  --  the matter of proof becomes all-important . In a charge of driving without a license , the proof is not hard to come by . The accused driver has no license to produce when he 's taken to the police station . And a look at the records of the state drivers-license agency will prove that he 's had his license suspended or revoked . But in a drunk-driving charge , the proof is more tenuous . A police officer may see a car driven erratically . He may stopthe car and detect the smell of liquor on the driver 's breath . He may observe that the driver 's appearance is chaotic and his speech is blurred . He may see that the driver loses his balance when he 's asked to walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But when he gets to court , he finds that the driver looks good and talks better . And that the driver says that the policeman 's observations were all subjective : " He never met me before . How does he know I was drunk ? " The driver may claim that he only had a couple of beers . Or that he has inner-ear trouble which affects his balance . Or that he was confused by bright lights or vague street signs , which is why he was driving erratically . More than that , if he 's a chronic drinker he 's been all through this before ; he knows how to cover his trail  --  or even to present a coherent roadside appearance  --  in an effort to avoid another drunk-driving charge . " We know that many drinking drivers do not show easy evidence of drinking , " says Dr. Robert F. Borkenstein , chairman of the Indiana University Department of Forensic Studies . " They may only show aggressiveness which , of course , can have other causes . So more aggressive driving plus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know just usually are n't enough to convey to the court the information needed to convict a person of driving while drunk . The police , in effect , are saddled with using crude arrest criteria developed a generation back . " The significance of all this is suggested by a businessman , now recovered from alcoholism , who says that he was stopped by the police on many occasions when he was driving while drunk . But he always looked presentable and he always had an excuse for his erratic driving , usually that he 'd been thrown into " shock " by some experience that he 'd just suffered . If he was stopped because he had an accident , he used the accident itself as an excuse for his lack of coherence  --  his inability to speak clearly or walk with good balance . " Once I drove my car into the town pond , " he said . Yet he escaped arrest for drunk driving because " the water snapped me back to a facade of ' instant sobriety ' " ? and he was able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plunging into the pond . How would he , as a constant offender , recommend that he be caught ? " Had the police required a chemical test , they would always have seen how drunk I was , " he said . The test is now available . It is called the Breathalyzer . It was developed by Dr. Borkenstein and it can not only determine whether a driver is drunk but just how drunk he is . For it measures with great accuracy just how much alcohol there is in the blood of a man suspected of driving while drunk . More than that , the Breathalyzer will conclusively clear any individual who is notdrunk  --  it will not react , for instance , to the acetone which is frequently on the breath of a person who has diabetes ( and which some police officers might mistake for the smell of alcohol ) . Take the case of a man in Baltimore who was observed driving erratically near the Sparrow Point steel works early one morning a few years ago . From all appearances  --  the smell of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the driver seemed to be drunk . The police officer arrested him , took him to the police station and charged him with drunk driving . He also asked if the man would take a Breathalyzer test . The man did so  --  and the test showed he had absolutely no alcohol in his blood . The police ran the test again and again the driver turned up completely clean . So now the police decided to find out why . The answer bordered on the tragic . The man was a diabetic who was afraid to reveal his condition for fear of losing his job in the steel mills . That morning he 'd taken his prescribed dose of insulin but , finding he was very late in getting started to work , he did not eat as he was required to . Then while he was driving to work , an insulin reaction began to set in and he began to lose control of some of his motor functions . ( Nervousness , fear , and excitability are classic symptoms of approaching insulin shock , along with a flushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might conceivably lead one to suspect drunkenness . ) That 's when the police spotted him and took him into the station . Had he refused the Breathalyzer test , he might have been thrown into a cell block until he could sleep if off , and perhaps , alone in a cell , he could have fallen into insulin shock so profound that he might have died . With the results of the Breathalyzer test before them , the police were able to discern that the man was not drunk and to find out enough about his condition to get him the kind of medical help needed to save his life . The traffic-court magistrate who dropped the drunk-driving charges pointed out that the Breathalyzer tests are invaluable in clearing the innocent as well as helping to convict the guilty . " In this particular case , " said then-magistrate John R. Marvin , " it probably saved a man 's life . " Until now , breath testing has been confined largely to the period after a driver has been arrested . Today there is a rising demand to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrest  --  at the roadside when the suspect 's car has been curbed . In that way , the innocent can be cleared immediately , without going through the rigamarole of arrest and station-house breath testing ; and the guilty can not only be discovered but the extent of their drunkenness can be pinpointed immediately . In any case , some 90.7 percent of those responding to The Saturday Evening Post poll confirmed the need for breath testing before arrest , not after it . It was the pre-arrest breath test which had such a dramatic impact on drunk driving in England . In 1967 the British passed legislation which established .08 percent as the presumptive level of drunkenness and which authorized chemical tests at roadside to see if a driver had passed that level . The British bobbies were given authority not only to stop a car that had been in an accident or which was being driven erratically but also to examine any person suspected of having alcohol in his body that is , one who comes staggering out of a pub and is heading for a car . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not drunk , he was not arrested . If it proved that he was above the legal limit , he was immediately arrested and taken to jail to await trial . The certitude of this fate- the knowledge that there was no deluding the police and no escaping detection of drunkenness-had a profound effect on British drinking-and-driving habits . Road traffic at night dropped . There was a rush of women into Britain 's driving schools , presumably so they could be prepared to come down to the pub and pick up their drunken men and drive them home . But the greatest impact was in the drunk-driving statistics . In the first December of the program , death-by-drunkdriver dropped 33 percent . In the first eighteen months of the test , drunk-driving fatalities dropped 15 percent and overall road casualties dropped 10 percent , even though road traffic in the nation went up during that period . If lives could be saved at the same rate in the United States , some 4,500 to 5,000 persons might be preserved from sacrifice to the killer-drunk . Yet for several years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the United States . Now , in response to the demand for action , the various state legislatures have begun recognizing their responsibilities in this area . In the last year or so , seven states enacted laws permitting pre-arrest breath testing . They were Indiana , Maine , Minnesota , Nebraska , New York , North Dakota and Virginia . So also has the city of Baton Rouge in Louisiana . In most cases-but not all -- the laws are designed to bulwark a policeman 's case for making a drunk-driving arrest , not to produce evidence in court . Of them all , perhaps the most closely studied is the law in Baton Rouge . For one thing , it was easier to get the whole program off the ground in a small city ( population , 161,783 ) than in a large state : the policemen could be trained and equipped more easily and the public information program could be focused more sharply and at less cost . In addition , t he Baton Rouge law has been in effect long enough-more than two years- in a jurisdiction small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such scope , and supported so enthusiastically by public authority , that the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety joined in the study . One reason : it hoped to get a test of the constitutionality of the pre-arrest breath-testing law by some person arrested in Baton Rouge . For some persons claim that the pre-arrest breath-testing system violates the constitution in that it represents unreasonable search and seizure and forces the person to produce evidence that will incriminate him . Advocates of the system point out that the roadside breath testing is simply a more scientific and exact extension of the usual roadside tests of detecting the odor of liquor on the breath of the driver , or having the driver walk a straight line or pick up a coin off the road . The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety tends to believe in the constitutionality of the pre-arrest test , but if the courts disagree it wants the case to go to the state or United States Supreme Courts to find out exactly why they disagree . The constitutional test never developed . Only one significant lawsuit was brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technicalities in the case , it never came before the Supreme Court of Louisiana or the nation . But the law had dimension and impact on the lives of the people of Baton Rouge in other ways . Put into enforcement on November 15 , 1969 , it stated that any individual operating a motor vehicle within the city of Baton Rouge is considered to have given his consent to a pre-arrest breath test when asked to do so by a police officer . At first , refusal to take the test could result in a fine of $200 or a jail term of up to sixty days or both . That part of the law has since been amended so that there is now no such penalty for refusing the test ; however , the refusal can he used in court against the driver if he happens to contest the drunk-driving arrest . In the early days , the Baton Rouge police gave roadside breath tests only after a driver had been in a collision in which alcohol was believed to be a cause of the crash . Then they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violations . It is not the police officer in a squad car who administers the test : it is an expert in such tests who is summoned to the scene in his " blue bus . " This is a carpeted van fitted out with special equipment ranging from police radios , voltage inverters and temperature and humidity control equipment to a photo-electric Into ximeter , a device that combines chemical change with electronic measurement to provide an accurate measurement of the amount of alcohol in a person 's blood . ( The " blue bus " was equipped by the Insurance Institute of Highway Safety and leased to the city of Baton Rouge for $1 a year . ) The policeman driving the " blue bus " is specially trained to operate all the equipment in the vehicle and to administer the breath tests with precise skill . But the " blue bus " is not itself a " cruising cop , " designed to chase and curb suspected drunk drivers . Nor is it used for wholesale spot checks of traffic passing a roadblock in search of drunk drivers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was specially trained in administering and interpreting the test . ( He is now classified as an " expert witness " when he testifies in cases that appear in certain of the courts . ) He works specific hours-usually 7 p.m. to 3 a.m. on Tuesday through Saturday- and takes the van home with him when he 's off duty . ( He 's actually on call twenty-four hours a day , in case there 's a serious accident in which drunk driving is suspected . ) On the average , it takes less than fifteen minutes for the " blue bus " to respond to a policeman 's call . That does not much interfere with the process of examination : " We have a rule that the driver must be under the observation of a police officer for twenty minutes before the test is administered , " says Officer Legier . The rule protects the driver in case he 's had a drink but only one drink-just before getting into his car . " The alcohol in his mouth might register on the Intoximeter in the first twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the protection of the time lapse . " Once the protection period passes , the driver is asked to enter the van , which is equipped with table and chairs , to take a breath test . If he tests at .10 percent or above , he must be arrested under the law and charged with driving while intoxicated . In the first months of the program , the drivers who were arrested were taken to the police station where they were given a second test on another Intoximeter . That practice has since been abandoned ; the roadside tests are considered accurate enough to he sustained in court , if need be . But the period in which two tests were made turned up some interesting facts : the time lapse between the two tests averaged forty-five minutes and the blood-alcohol content of the persons examined dropped an average of .02 percent in that time . The " blue bus " has worked well in two ways : To protect the innocent : of the first 150 persons in the " blue bus , " thirty-one were found to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirteen of them were below the .05 percent level . ) These drivers , points out Albert Benjamin Kelley of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety , " were saved from the indignity of an unwarranted arrest for driving while under the influence of alcohol . " To detect the guilty : of the first 150 persons tested in the " blue bus , " thirty-six were not only above the .10 percent level but doubled that level-they recorded , says Kelley , " an astounding .20 percent or over in their blood-alcohol blood tests . " That means they had consumed an extremely large amount of alcohol and yet did not display definite outward signs of drunkenness ( since the police officer called for the " blue bus " only when he was in doubt about the driver 's drunkenness ) . The combination of circumstances was enough to suggest that such persons had been accustomed to consuming a great deal of alcohol for a long time-they were , in short , the kind of chronic drinkers who pose the greatest threat on the highway . But how effective was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identification of the drunk driver . The number of arrests for driving while intoxicated tripled in 1970 over the 1969 figure . It cut the numbers of death-bydrunk-driver almost in half . For several years , the number had been going up , from twenty-two in 1966 to forty in 1968 . In 1971 , the number was down to twenty-two again , though the number of cars and miles driven in Baton Rouge had increased in the meantime . As the demand for such a system increases , the technical perfection is likely to rise . The ideal is to have a scientific breath-testing device so sure , so small and so portable that it could be installed in any squad car and operated by any police officer . That would provide the ultimate in both protection and detection : the driver who does n't reach the presumptive limits might be relieved of danger of a drunk-driving charge , while the chronic drinker would be quickly identified , no matter how practiced an act he put on at roadside . More than that , such a device might-in the view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that customers could test themselves before going out to drive a car . If they tested at or above the presumptive level , they might forego the idea of driving , if only to preserve themselves from the danger of arrest . They also might learn how " forgiving " the law is : it is quite difficult for the occasional drinker to get up to the presumptive limit , though he might be warned that his driving is often impaired even if he falls below the legal limit . " Only about 150 persons out of a thousand got up to the presumptive level , " said Dr. Borkenstein after he held a series of " drink-ins " with his Breathalyzer . These were special sessions at which a variety of people - policemen , judges , lawyers , service-club members , and so forth- were asked to measure their drinking capacity against what the Breathalyzer reported as their blood-alcohol content . " One judge drank and drank until he could n't drink any more and still he tested out at .07 percent , " says Dr. Borkenstein . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking the test because it 's very unlikely he 'll reach the presumptive limit ; thus it will be up to the police officer to prove drunkenness without the help of the Breathalyzer . The accumulated evidence is that it is only the very heavy and consistent drinker-the one who is most likely to cause a fatal accident-who tests " high " enough on the scientific devices to be subject to certain arrest and conviction . Two studies in California showed that 95 percent of the persons arrested for drunk driving tested out at .15 percent-a concentration far above that at which all individuals are affected . Another study in Oregon noted that of 1,000 drivers convicted of driving while intoxicated , the average blood-alcohol concentration at the time of booking in the police station was .21 percent . Once the occasional drinker understands this , he will find the Breathalyzer an ally , not an enemy , in preserving his safety on the roads . This could bring him vigorously into the combat to curb the killer-drunk . Between the energies and interests of the occasional drinker and the nondrinker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deviant driver a virtual outgroup ' against which could be rallied tremendous social pressures . " Such pressures could lead to legal action-now - to reduce the torment of death-by-drunk in America . The need is there . The demand is there . The method is there . The difficulty is in making clear to those in politics that the alternative to action is not merely inaction but the death of tens of thousands of persons who will become the innocent victims of drunk drivers in the next year . It is for that reason that The Saturday Evening Post hopes to drive home to them , and to the public which puts them in office , that the need is imperative and that the voices which expressed that need speak with determination-in a tone tinged with tragedy . And with hope , and with gratitude . " I am an alcoholic who has been cured of drinking , ' ? wrote one man .
