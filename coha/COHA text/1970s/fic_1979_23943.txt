STORYIELLER A short story by Lewis Nordan I T WAS WILEY HEARD talking and cooling his coffee at the same time . " You heard about all them grain elevators blowing up in Kansas , did n't you ? " Wiley was a short , wiry , one-legged man with a red face and white eyebrows . He was retired head coach of the local football team . He stopped blowing across his coffee and took a long , slurping pull , then held up the heavy cup , like evidence , so everybody could see . One or two of those standing around moved in closer to the marble counter and were careful not to turn over a spittoon . They poured cups for themselves and lay their change on the cash register . " See this ? " he said . " It 's the best cup of coffee in the en-tire state of Arkansas . Right here in Hassell 's Blank Store . Used to be called Hassell 's Drug Store , long time ago , back before any you boys would remember . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Early Times into his coffee from a flat bottle he slipped out of his jacket pocket . " Yessir , " he said , " Gene Hassell sold the wrong drugs to the wrong man . Two men , in fact . Federal agents pretending to work on a truck for two days across the street , out yonder by the railroad tracks , before they come in for the pills . On account of which old Gene 's pharmacy license got - taken away . And so did Gene , come to think of it , down to the Cummins penitentiary . Could n't get him in Atlanta . It was all full up that year , I think was the trouble . His wife , poor thing , Miss Eva . I swan , she just painted out the word Drug on the sign and held a shotgun up under her chin , bless her time . It was that old twelve-gauge of Gene 's that kicked so bad , real old gun , belonged to his daddy and ejected shells out the bottom . Remington , I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her face , the whole damn thing from the bottom up , jaw , teeth , nose , and eyes , and broke both her eardrums . Terrible sight to see , even after the skin grafts . No face at all . Ca n't sec , hear , smell , or taste , just keep her alive in a nursing home down in Arkadelphia , feeding her through tubes , and not one pellet touched her brain . it 's a sad case , boys . It would break your heart . We been calling it Hassell 's Blank Store ever since , and him still in jail , I guess , or dead , but you say you did hear about them grain elevators , did n't you ? " Somebody said he had . Everybody else agreed . " I know you did , " the coach said . " You heard about it on the Walter Cronkite Show , did n't you ? They had it on the TV every night for a month , seem like . But I bet you forty dollars you did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , did you ? Just outside El Dorado . I ought to say , over close to Smackover . A dog-food factory blew up . That 's about like El Dorado , ai n't it ? Ai n't nowhere but El Dorado , and maybe parts of north Mississippi , they going to blow up a dog-food factory . But you never will hear that one on the Walter Cronkite Show , nayo-siree , and do n't need to . The longer they can keep El Dorado , Arkansas , off the national news , or Smackover , either one , the better for everybody , is what I say . Hound Dog dog-food factory  --  and three men are missing , so they tell me . Might of been mule skinners , might n't they ? I think they was , in fact . If any you boys are looking for work they going to need somebody to skin them miserable old horses before they put them in a can . Over this side of El Dorado actually , up close to Smackover . But that was years ago Gene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , years ago . Hell , he may not be dead now , all I know . Probably is , though . Probably is dead now he ca n't drink no more of that paragoric . He probably died his second day off that paragorie , did n't he ? He 'd been drinking it for twenty years . He 'd been constipated that long . He probably did n't know what to think , did he , down there in Cummins behind them bars , or out on that hot scrabble farm chopping him some prison cotton , when he felt that first urge to go to the bathroom . Hell , he probably died right off , did n't he ? Did n't even have to call the dispensary . He probably got him a shit fit and the blind staggers and keeled over with his eyes rolled up . His old crazy paragoric eyes probably looked like the rolled-up window shades of Miss Dee 's whorehouse on Sunday morning , he was so happy . But not Miss Eva , that 's his wife , she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Wee Care Nursing Home , got a married daughter out in California . or is it granddaughter , pays the bills , that little red brick building with the neon sign saying Wee Care out on the old airport road , real nice place and expensive , too . But Jerry Rich down in Prescott , out beyond Prescott really , just this side of Delight , he 's the one owns this place now , Hassell 's Blank Store . He 's owned it for years . Poor old woman had to sell out right away , of course , after she lost so much face here in town trying to kill herself , and her husband in the pokey . The daughter had to sell , I mean , and no face at all , Miss Eva , and never did have much personality to speak of . But old Jerry , he does n't get up here much any more , long as there 's a quail in them cornfields and one old sorry dog in the pen . Not even to change the name on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be a piss-pore way to remember a good man , though . now would n't it ? Lord , but his wife was a boring woman , even back when she had a face . It was three of them missing , three skinners , all of them white men , I believe it was . I 'm not real sure about that . Dog-food factory over in El Dorado , outside El Dorado really , out close to Smackover , Hound Dog dog-food factory . " W LET WAS STILL TALKING . " They used to feed dog food to circus animals . Sounds awful , do n't it ? But it 's true . It 'd make them crazy , too . It 'd make a trained beast turn on his master . so I hear . Nothing to be done about a bitch elephant once they turn on their keeper . Bull elephant 's a different story , trustworthiest old wrinkled buggers you ever want to meet , but not a bitch . You boys ask around , see ai n't I right . You ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on life , might as well save yourself the trouble . " " Why 's that , Coach Wiley ? " The coffee-drinkers turned and looked . It was Hydro , agawky young man with a broom and a large head . " Nobody knows , " the coach said , " and do n't ask no more questions , Hydro . Godamighty . You get on done with that sweeping before you start asking so many questions . But it happened one time over in Pocahontas . One two y'all might be old enough to remember it . Your daddies 'd be old enough . Some little off-brand circus or other . Clyde Beatty or something . Naw , not even that good . They had two old scrawny lions that hollered half the night they was so hungry from eating that dried dog food they give them . Probably Hound Dog dog food , when they was looking for meat , like that place blew up over past El Dorado , except that factory was n't there till ten years ago , so it must have been sofne other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to feed dog food to a lion and get away with it . King Jesus jump down . It 'd take a worthless sumbiteh to do that , now would n't it ? Worthless as a whistle on a plow , as my poor old dead daddy used to say . Daddy he was a funny little quiet man with rusty hair and deep eyes . Housepainter and paperhanger , and a good one too , and a handful of elephants with their nose up each other 's ass like a parade and some scrawny old woman in a little white dress and bleached-out hair riding on top of the first elephant , when this baggy old gray African elephant went kind of crazy . Commercial-Appeal said she was in heat and real nervous . That 's when they dangerous . Some old boy name of Orwell , from West Memphis or Forrest City or somewhere , was quoted as saying that was right . He claimed to know all about elephants , though I ca n't say I ever knew a family of Arkansas Orwells . Plenty of them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my memory in Arkansas . Unless , of course , they come here since the world war , but I think she was just sick of Pocahontas and circus food . That 'd be me . Best thing ever happened to Pocahontas was that tornado in 1957. tore down half the town . They 're just about due an . other one , if you want my personal opinion . Did n't have many teeth , my daddy , and had fainting spells on top of that , because you notice she did n't bother to pick out her own trainer to step on . That 'd be too easy . She had to bring down all hell and her left front foot on another African , one of her own people , you might say . She had to step on some little local boy hired on as a handler . Plez Moore 's grandson is who it was , in case some y'all are old enough to remember Plez . Course my daddy always did love his whiskey and had a heart enlarged up to the size of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that come to pass , who I always liked . Plez I 'm talking about , and hated to see anything bad come to him in spite of not especially blaming the elephant and never could straight . en up his back , Plez , on account of getting syphilis when he was just a boy , stepped right on that poor little child and flattened him out like one them cartoon pictures when a steamroller runs over somebody He looked like a pitiful little black shadow some child lost . But you could n't blame the elephant , I could n't , having to live cooped up in Pocahontas all week and that terrible sawed-off circus . It would n't do , though . but they had to kill the elephant , and you can see their point , especially if that Orwell boy from West Memphis knew what he 's talking about , though I still think he was from somewhere over in Mississippi , " Anyhow , that 's what the mayor and aldermen said , got to destroy the elephant . They was agreed with by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name and is joined up with the NAACP . They was quickly agreed with , I might add , which was the first and last time the Pocahontas town officials and the colored ministers ever agreed on anything , except maybe last year when Horace Mayhan  --  you remember him playing football right here in town and always stunk real bad , before old man Mayhan moved them all to Pocahontas where they 'd belonged all along and fit in so good with the paper mill  --  last year when old Horace won a free trip , so to speak , to Washington , D.C. He had to testify before a Senate subcommittee on the subject of who cut them eyeholes into the sheets the FBI found in the trunk of Horace 's car , that cream-colored Mustang with the rusted top and STP stickers on the front bumper . That boy gave new meaning to the words white trash , not to mention who sawed the stocks and barrels off all his shotguns and enough dynamite to provide every man , woman , and child in Arkansas fish dinner every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , that nobody in Pocahontas had a gun big enough to kill an elephant , not even a hungry old scrawny elephant that probably needed killing . " " Shoot him in the eye . " The words totally unexpected , but the minute they in the air everybody knew it was Hydro again . He had forgotten that the coach told him to stay quiet . It was obvious from his enormous face that he thought he had made a good suggestion and obvious to everybody else that he was in trouble . The coach stopped talking and looked at him . The others looked at the floor and tried not to breathe . " Hydro , my man , " Coach Wiley said , with a chill in his voice that galvanized every gaze upon the floor , " I always kind of liked you , boy . And I know you got your own problems . But listen here . Do n't you never interrupt me again . Not now , and not never . Not till you get smart enough to know a whole hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eye . " " Or , " said a voice with an unnatural cheeriness , " maybe you could just shoot him up the butt . " It was Hydro again . He had missed the fury underlying the coach 's tone . If anybody standing around the coach in the Blank Store had n't been too embarrassed to think of it , they would have hated Hydro , and themselves ; and they would have hated God for making Hydro so damn dumb . Nobody thought of it . Nobody knew why they depended on Wiley Heard 's approval , and dreaded his disapproval . " It 's bound to bust something loose up in there , " Hydro said , still pleased as he could be to help . The coach became more deliberate . For everybody but Hydro , breathing was out of the question . Some of this began to dawn on Hydro . " Hydro , " Coach Wiley Heard said , " I am going to say this one more time . Now , boy , I mean for you to listen . Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to answer . He had caught on now . " Shoot him in the eye and shoot him up the butt will not do . Not to interrupt me telling a story , nawsir . And neither will anything else do , to interrupt me telling a story . Are you listening , Hydro ? Not nothing that you or anybody else that 's going to come into Hassell 's Blank Store is likely to think up is going to do to interrupt me . So just forget about interrupting me , boy . At any Lime , or for any reason whatsoever , with shoot him in the eye or shoot him up the butt or anything else . Now do you understand what I 'm saying ? " Hydro was quiet and miserable . He said " Yessir " in a tiny whispery voice . He recognized his chastisement . Breathing started up again . Throats got cleared and feet were shifted . Some of the little crowd looked up . W HEN THE COACH finally spoke again , it was not to them , not at first , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coarse and gravelly , and there was a snort of a humorless laugh behind it . " Shoot him up the butt , " they heard him say , almost soundless , and they heard the low , snorting laugh . A few of them laughed a little , too , they tried it anyway , the laughter , not loud and not self-confident , and when they heard it they found no pleasure in its sound . For a few more seconds he let the silence continue . He sweetened his coffee again with Early Times , and they made sure they did n't notice . When he began again , the tone of his story was immeasurably darker . There were no more self-interruptions , there was no more marshaling of irrelevant detail . The story had become deadly serious and even most of the errors of grammar had disappeared from his speech . If the story were told again , or if it had been told without Hydro 's interruption , each person in the store could have imagined it as wonderfully comic , the dark , laughing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not comic now . The elephant , he said , would have to be killed . It would have to be killed by hanging . Some let out sounds that might have passed for laughs , though none of them were proud to have done so . " By now the elephant was quiet , " he said . " I saw her led to town by her trainer , a dirty man and sad-faced . The bleach-haired woman was with them , too , wearing a maroon suit and low-heeled shoes , the one who rode the elephant in the parade . The railroad crane and log-chain were on a flat car . The chain was made into a noose and put around its neck . The giant gears started creaking , the crane was lifting . I remember a blind fiddler was in the crowd and a little Indian boy with blue short pants and no shirt high up on the top of a locomotive . The elephant 's feet were like the feet of a great turtle . The hind feet brushed the air a scant inch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was up , hanging there , choking , she lifted the wrinkled old trunk straight up and trumpeted one time , one blast to heaven , before she was choked dead . Her back feet , her gray old big turtle feet , were just an inch above the cinders , a little inch . " Those who listened stood , silent , and held their coffee cups without drinking . One man , whose son stood beside him , lay an unconscious hand on the boy 's arm and pulled him a little closer to his side . No one knew what to say , or do . For the moment , during the silence , they forgot that Coach Wiley Heard was in charge , in control of the pause . He allowed a few more seconds to pass . They thought of the beast 's trumpeting . They did not imagine , even for a second . that the coach 's story might be untrue , that he might have made it all up , or adapted it from an older tale , and now maybe even believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened on a certain day , to a certain people with bleached hair or sad faces or blind eyes or Indian blood , or any other hair and face and eyes andblood he chose to give them , and that it all happened in a station yard in eastern Arkansas , in a town called Pocahontas . If disbelief crept in , it carne like a welcome brother into their company . They poured it a cup of coffee and showed it the sugar bowl and treated it like a friend too familiar to notice . They thought only of the gray feet and the cinders , the little inch between . Then it was over . The coach released them . With a sudden , unexpected cheeriness , and maybe even a wink , he said , " You not going to forget what I told you , now are you , Hydro ? " " No sir , " Hydro said , certain he would not , but still a little uncertain how to act . The coffee drinkers were able to love Hydro again , and pity him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and looked at its bristles . Everybody felt confident and happy . Everybody smiled at Hydro 's innocence and at his need for forgiveness . " Shoot him up the butt ! " the coach roared suddenly , merry and hilarious and slapping his good leg . " Shoot him up the butt ! Great godamighty l " Now they could laugh . They did laugh , uproarious and long . The coach slapped Hydro on the back and called him son and hugged him roughly against him and shook him by the shoulders . " Shoot him up the butt ! " he said again . " Got damn , Hydro , I 'm going to have to tell that one on you , now ai n't I ! " When the laughter was over and the coach had wiped a tear from each eye with a clean handkerchief , he spoke to Hydro in a voice a little different from the one they had been listening to for most of the day . He said , " Let me tell you about my daddy , son . You 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all one winter , he had tonsillitis so bad . " They knew now they could stay and hear this story if they wished , but they knew also it would not be told to them . They envied Hydro . They wished they were Hydro . They wished they were holding his broom and feeling the coach 's warm , alcoholic breath on their faces . " Daddy always smelled like turpentine and Fitch 's shampoo , " they heard the coach say , as if from a distance . " It 's the only place I ever smelled the two in combination . It breaks my heart to remember . " There was a pause , a silence of a few seconds . " He carried this little nickel pistol with him , " the coach said , thoughtful . " I 'll show it to you sometime . A little nickel thirty-two pistol , with walnut handlegrips . " Hydro was happy . Everybody could see that . There was no reason for anybody else to hang around , though . They eased out by ones and twos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
