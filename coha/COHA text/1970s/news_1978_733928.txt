txt JERSEY CITY  --  There was joy on " Goldberg Prospect " the night Semeon and Sofia Rozin arrived from Moscow . " Goldberg Prospect " is the nickname that Soviet Jewish refugees in Jersey City have given to Montgomery Street , which runs through the downtown area on the Hudson River where their extraordinary community has grown in the last four years . The nickname is a tribute to Arthur Abbe Goldberg , a young Wall Street lawyer and investment banker ' who has built up the community that now members more than 300 persons . THE ROZINS represented the missing older generation of an extended family here . Twenty persons gathered in the apartment of their son , Lev Rozin , who has been here four years , and enjoyed an American-style cocktail party while waiting for the elder Rozins . Lev Rozin was a school teacher in the // To Russian emigres , Jersey City is home // Soviet Union . Now he owns and drives a taxicab in Manhattan . He and his sister 's husband , Lev Naiman , went to pick up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there was n't that much conversation , just a lot of laughing and shouting and crying . Then the Rozins met their two grandsons . MRS . ROZIN , a physician , said the couple had trouble after applying for permission to leave the Soviet Union . " The Soviet authorities delayed the answer for seven months , and we could n't work during that time , " she said . She said problems also emerged in connection with selling their home . Luckily the purchaser was a big movie producer , and the deal went through . " Now I can live and enjoy life , " said Lev . " We were so close in Russia . They gave me a good education , and now I will try to repay them . " GOLDBERG I1OVERED over the happy scene . He said the Rozins would live with their son for a while and then would be " resettled " somewhere in the area by Goldberg 's organization , the Committee for the Absorption of Soviet Emigres CASE . Seeing a young woman named Marina Yakobson , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's early days . In 1974 , a week or two before Rosh Hashanah , a Jewish relief organization , HIAS , put a group of Russian emigres into a Jersey City hotel . Someone noticed them and remarked on their " young faces . " Goldberg invited them to the Sherman Avenue Talmud Torah-New Synagog . One was Yakobson , now a biology student . " Can you help my parents get jobs ? " she asked Goldberg . HE SAID HE 'D try to help and asked the group where they were going to settle . " Somewhere here in New York , " they replied . Amused at the geographical error , Goldberg explained that they were not in New York , but in New Jersey . Then he thought , " why not Jersey City ? " Especially the Exchange Place area . Lying just across the Hudson , a threeminute subway ride from Wall Street , the area was about as convenient as you could get to New York without actually being in it . TILE UPSHOT WAS that he went to the Ukrainian National Association @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building . He found that the non-Jewish head of that group , a refugee himself many years ago , was delighted to rent some of his apartments to the new exiles . CASE was organized with a board consisting half of the emigres themselves and a largely emigre staff . Relatives and friends followed the original settlers , and a scattered community of Russians emerged . Now they are beginning to buy and renovate run-down rowColumn 1 houses of the last century . Using public financing arranged by Jersey City Mayor Thomas F. X. Smith , CASE as the " charitable sponsor " is completing the renovation of a block of brownstones to be rented starting next month . CASE also has acquired an old five-story building and is trying to raise funds to convert it into a community center . World attention has focused on the persecution of Jewish rights dissidents in the Soviet Union . The pressure has resulted in increased emigration . Some of the immigrants arrive with only small bags and the clothes on their backs . Goldberg estimates that it costs CASE about $3,000 to resettle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent of the people in the Soviet emigre community here are nonJewish , usually friends or relatives , Goldberg said . He said he worked on a case where two young Russian Jews wanted to get married and emigrate . So did their close friends , two young Russian non-Jews . Because it would be easier for the Jews to get exit visas than the non-Jews , they arranged marriages of convenience , Jew to non-Jew , to last until they got to Vienna . They all got out of Russia and Goldberg had to help them get divorces so they could marry the right partners . TILE EXILES SAY exit visas are given out on a regional basis , and policies vary . Joseph Shneberg , Russian co-chairman of CASE with Goldberg who is chairman , described his own unhappy complication . He was sitting in his apartment in a renovated 1888 bank building with two other young men from Riga , Boris Polyak and Solomon Tencer . They had a chessboard set up and were watching TV . Shneberg , a Jew , had a non-Jewish wife . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago , he was told by the authorities he could not go because his wife was n't Jewish . The suggestion was made that they divorce and that when he arrived at his destination , he could send back an " invitation for a family reunion " to recover his wife . SCIINEBERG SAID HE followed the plan but that when he sent back the " invitation , " Soviet authorities told him it would n't work because she , having been divorced , was no longer a family member . He said he is appealing to Russians and Ameriqans alike . Many of the residents of Goldberg Prospect are quite outspoken about their joy at being away from the Soviet Union . " I pray in Hebrew , " said David Mondrus , 70 , retired chief engineer of a Soviet Research Institute . " One prayer I say every day is Thank God , He helped us to get out , to be all right .
