One of the scare stories about China that circulated in the ' 60s , especially during the brief ride of the Red Guards , was that Maoism had flung out the past : 3,000 years of willow-pattern tranquillity overthrown , Confucius and Mencius consigned to the paper shredder , and the arts of the ancestral dynasties-Chou and Han , T'ang and Sung , Ming and Chi'ing-abandoned as relics of decadent feudalism , replaced by the cast-concrete colossus of Mao or the agitprop poster of beaming , eupeptic tractor drivers exceeding their norm in Szechwan province . <P> This , like so many of our ideas about China , was a myth . In fact , the Chinese seem to have taken Mao 's apothegm , " Let the past serve the present , " with a literalness that Western archaeologists-hampered as they are by the depredations of the antiquity market-might envy . Since about 1950 , China 's policy for exhuming and classifying its own past has been very coherent and systematic . Indeed , no Western country has produced a state-funded archaeology program to equal China 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it lacks in the West . <P> Recent Finds . From this official attitude has come what must arguably be the most beautiful exhibition Europe has yet seen in the ' 70s : " Treasures of Chinese Art , " a loan show of some 400 recent finds from the People 's Republic , on view at the Petit Palais in Paris through the summer . Later it will travel to London and early next year to Toronto . It is the fruit of almost ten years ' negotiation between the Chinese and French governments , begun by ex-Culture Minister Andr Malraux and finished in detail by a group of orientalists headed by Vadime Elisseeff , chief curator of the Muse Cernuschi in Paris . Encyclopedic in scope-the objects on display range from rudimentary quartz and flint scrapers used by Peking Man in 500,000 B.C. to the exquisite porcelains and silver toilet articles of the Yuan dynasty , which ended in A.D. 1368-it is intelligently mounted , with unobtrusive panels of photos , documents and information : an ideal teaching show , in fact . But unlike most didactic exhibitions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> The centerpiece is Princess Tu Wan 's funeral shroud . Found in 1968 in a Han dynasty tomb in Man-Ch'eng , less than 100 miles from Peking , it has already become an object of legend-the Chinese counterpart ( at least in Western eyes ) to Tutankhamon 's gold mask . This is partly due to its extraordinary substance and workmanship : a complete body-armor of 2,156 slips of green and mutton-fat jade , each no bigger than a matchbook cover , intricately sewn and bound together with gold wire . Its archaeological interest is unique : ancient Chinese texts mentioned jade burial armor as the special privilege of imperial blood , but Tu Wan 's shroud-together with its twin , made for her husband , the Prince Liu Cheng-is the first such suit yet unearthed . But that aside , the shroud has an almost hallucinatory air : a green and glittering robot of semiprecious stone , assembled round a dummy . The blunt toes and plated wedge of a nose point at the roof , the eyeless head rests as though in a machine 's sleep on its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
