txt WHEN BOB EVANS  --  the movie producer , not the guy down on the farm with his sausages  --  was a young actor , Norma Shearer wanted to buy " The Last Tycoon " for him to star in . But Evans was so bad in a movie he did with Norma that she gave up the idea of casting him as F. Scott Fitzgerald 's last hero . No matter . In many ways Evans seems to be playing the role In real life . Handsome , charming , slick as they come , he lives in a Hollywood mansion and has beautiful ex-wives and ! ady friends , His other friends range from Henry Kissinger to Jack Nicholson to Sidney Korshak . As head of production for Paramount , he oversaw such films as " Love Story " and " The Godfather . " As a producer he came up with " Chinatown . ' And currently he is on the road promoting " Marathon Man , " the big movie he Close-up With I Dorothy Collin made from William Goldman 's best-selling book . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promoting a movie ? " When you work two years on a film and believe in it and spend your guts on il , you 've got to follow through , " Evans said . " It 's like having a baby . " 1 spent several hours Thursday , watch . ing Evans lend his baby . Mid though he certainly slid some tycoonlike things , he also came across asa highly motivated businessman who could have been selling Butterball turkeys just as successfully as a multimillion-dollar movie . AFTER TWO interviews in his hotel suite , he arrived via limousine at CBS where he did a radio interview . Ito was superb . He talked about his movie l " broke the record of ' Godfather ' and ' Love Story ' , " I his personal life and ex-wife All ( " I 've been in the cutting room a lot more than the bedroom " I , and about his career as an actor . I " The Sun Also Rises ' was 19 years ago , and you know , it feels like it " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announcer 's voice , which was nut surprising because Evans was also once a radio actor and announcer . Occasionally he twiddled his thumbs , but elegantly , as befits a tycoon . AFTER THE interview , he raced to a phone to call his local public relations man to make sure an ad to be placed in newspapers for his movie contained just the right quotes from critics . " I hope it will be clear , " he said evenly , and you got the feeling that it better be . Next came an appearance on the Lee Phillip Show with actress Anne Baxter . Again , Evans was smooth as ice but much warmer . They talked about Baxter 's great movie , All About Eve , " and again about " The Sun Also Rises . " " Hemingway did n't want me in the movie . Ave Gardner did n't want me . Errol Flynn did n't care . " The only one who wanted him to play the bullfighter was Darryl Zanuck . And since Zanuck was the producer , Zanuck won . You could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a producer than an actor . At the end of the show , Lee Phillip said , " Thank you , Bob Evans , for being with us " and cut to the commercial Close-up which boomed through the studio : " Bob Evans , down on the farm . " IT MUST have been one of the only unplanned events in Evans ' itinerary , which had taken him to New York ; Atlanta , where he did 10 radio and TV shows in one day ; and Chicago , where he did at least 10 interviews , but in two days . I did one of those interviews , at Evans ' hotel suite . When I arrived , he was on the phone , getting the grosses for his movie , just as a good tycoon should , and giving orders . " What you got ta do , Julian . . And apparently Julian said something about the weather holding down ticket sales in some city because Evans replied , " I do n't want to hear weather reports . " Off the phone , Evans curled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to " watch everything " about his favored movies " from the projectionist to what time the film goes on . " , HE UNROLLED a proof of a double-truck newspaper ad and told how he had Picked out every critic 's quote . And if he was n't satisfied the first time , he did it again , For instance , he decided the Newsweek critic 's quote should be changed from " an intelligent and satisfying thriller " to " A tight , suspenseful , scary , satisfying thriller . " He thought people would be more likely to see something scary than something intelligent . " You have to market a film perfect . ly , " he said . But he said he was n't really a salesman . " If a picture is good , then I go out and sell it , but there are a lot of other pictures I would n't do it for . I would n't even go to the bathroom for ' Mandingo . ' " You have to make an event out of a film . You have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could n't sell something I did n't believe in . " I asked Evans if he was n't also creating an image for himself and using it to sell his movies . " I am what I am , " he said . " I 'm not creating images , I do just what I want to do , " AS PART of Evans ' tour , Paramount provided reprints of an article from New West magazine that portrayed him as ... the last tycoon . It also made him seem rather flakey , popping Valium and Nembutal , heart-broken over Ali 's leaving him , a ? lonely and vulnerable man . Somehow that did n't seem to jibe with a man who has run a large movie studio for 10 years , ' a man who has been responsible for some of the most successful movies in American history , a man who has survived the jungles of New York and Hollywood . Evans agreed that " one thing I am not is flakey . I suppose I do live a bit differently and conduct myself differently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am . " He also said he was n't tough , but after thinking about that for a minute he said : " I 'm very definite . Maybe I 'm tough when it comes to following through . I 'm very tough when it comes to detail . I do n't like mediocrity . " But I 'm not tough like Harry Cohn or Jack Warner . They were dictators . " They were also the last tycoons.
