txt When President Ferdinand E. Marcos declared martial law in 1972 , he avowed that one of its main purposes was to break up the wealthy families that had long controlled money and politics in the Philippines . But his critics charge that the only redistribution of wealth has been from one elite to another . Mr. Marcos 's supporters contend that much of this criticism stems from embittered members of the wealthy old families that once controlled the Philippines , families the President has displaced by redistributing the nation 's wealth under martial law . Among those who are said to have benefited most from the President 's powers under martial law is Roberto Benedicto , a fraternity brother of Mr. Marcos at the University of the Philippines . Mr. Benedicto now heads the newly created Sugar Commission , which Mr. Marcos has given a monopoly over the export of the large sugar crop . Ownership Difficult to Prove A former ambassador to Japan and head of the Government-owned Philippine National Bank , Mr. Benedicto also reportedly owns a bank , a shipping line , the largest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sugar lands and several new sugar mills , Since some of these enterprises are registered in the names of friends or associates , it Is difficult to prove his ownership . Mr. Marcos 's brother-in-law , Benjamin Romualdez , is governor of the province of Leyte . He is said to control The Times Journal , a major Manila newspaper , and he is generally believed to have benefited from the forced takeover of the Manila Electric Company from the Lopez family , once the wealthiest in the Philippines . Mr. Romualdez , who until recently was ambassador to China , has reportedly been proposed as ambassador to Washington . In a recent interview his sister , Imelda Marcos , said she thought the choice // 14. fdd be " good for the - United States .

Two of the most powerful military commanders also come from the President 's home area , Maj. Gen. Fabian Ver , chief of the presidential security guard . and Maj. Gen. Fidel V. Ramos , head of the Philippine Constabulary , the national police . Mrs. Marcos 's younger brother , Alfredo Romualdez , is said by knowledgeable Filipinos to be involved in a lucrative floating casino in Manila Bay and the jai-alai fronton . Ricardo Silverio , a close friend of the Marcoses. has made a fortune through owning the exclusive Toyota distributorship for the Philippines . Another friend , Rudolf ? Cuenca , is head of the cour.try 's biggest construction company , which is currently engaged in a $500 million project to reclaim 4.000 acres of Manila Harbor . His company will get half the land .

President Marcos helped a close friend and in-law , Herminio Disini , build a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a major competitor out of business . The decree imposed a 100 percent duty on the imported raw materials of Mr. Disini 's American and British-owned competitor and continued the usual 10 percent tariff on those used by Mr. Disini 's company . The two companies made filters for cigarettes . Mr. Marcos issued the decree In July 1975 after the foreign company , Filtrona Philippines Inc. , had turned down an offer from Mr. Disini to buy it out , according to a former executive of Filtrona . The , decree forced Filtrona to close its operations in the Philippines and left Mr. Disini with a near monopoly on the lucrative filter business here , with an estimated profit of more than $1 million a month . When the then United States Ambassador to the Philippines , William Sullivan , . , , utesled the decree to Mr. Marcos , the former Filtrona officer charged , the President attempted to blackmail Filtrona by suggesting it join Mr. Disini as a partner , in building a $40 million factory to manufacture cellulose for filters .

Some brokers say he acquired as much as $9.5 million worth of shares in an oil exploration company for only $675,000 shortly before President Marcos went on national television to announce that oil had been found . When afterward the major shareholders suddenly dumped their shares and the price plummeted 65 percent , the Philippines Securities and Exchange Cornmission found no evidence of wrongdoing . In an interview with The New York Times yesterday , President Marcos promised to conduct a broad investigation of Mr. Disini 's acquisitions and to divest him of sonic of the important ones , particularly a 500,000-acre timber concession , and the subsidiary that had been acting as Government agent for the proposed chemical complex .

One businessman with good contacts with Mr. Marcos recalls a dinner party in 1968 , three years after Mr. Marcos first became President and four years before he proclaimed martial law , at which a group of Cabinet members and confidantes jokingly decided to list all they knew about the President 's money . The total came to $60 million . In 1966 the Marcoses purchased a 17thcentury Spanish villa in a large lot near the official presidential residence . The sale price is said to have been more than $125,000 .
