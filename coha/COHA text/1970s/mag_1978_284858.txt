Legionnaires ' disease strikes <P> Immediately after investigating the recent outbreak of Legionnaires ' disease at Indiana University , the indefatigable detectives of the U.S. Center for Disease Control in Atlanta had to respond to yet another alarm . The mysterious malady had erupted in Manhattan 's crowded garment district . There , within a few city blocks , at least 75,000 men and women are jampacked by day , their indoor working conditions made bearable only by generous use of air conditioning . <P> When New York City hospitals began suspecting Legionnaires ' disease as the cause of the unusual type of pneumonia from which six garment-district patients were suffering , they sent blood samples first to the CDC laboratory in Manhattan for analysis and then to Atlanta . The CDC confirmed the diagnosis . By then two victims had died , both deliverymen , who trundle racks loaded with dresses through traffic-choked streets . Investigators looking for clues to the source of the outbreak instantly checked to see if the two worked for the same shop ; they did not , but were employed on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near by had died , probably a victim of Legionnaires ' too . With nothing to indicate a single , discrete source of infection , the only recourse was to sanitize the entire neighborhood . <P> The city 's government acted swiftly . Mayor Edward Koch appointed his deputy director of operations , Paul Caswell , to head a task force coordinating the efforts of city agencies combatting the disease . Working in what resembled a war room , Caswell ordered air-conditioning systems in the area shut off ; the CDC 's investigators had traced the earlier Indiana outbreak to an air conditioner with a bacteria-contaminated water supply . City inspectors swarmed through the district , taking water samples from air-conditioning systems , and draining and sterilizing rooftop tanks where the water was stored . Below , sanitationmen hosed down the streets and added a dash of mild pine oil to sweeten the smell . <P> Caswell also set up two telephone hot lines for New Yorkers worried about having Legionnaires ' disease to call in and discuss their symptoms . Almost 16,000 hot-line calls were logged in eight days . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 300 blood specimens from people who thought they might be infected . One surprising result : many of those working in the garment district were found to have antibodies against the bacterium now known to cause the disease , indicating that they had been infected-without suffering any apparent symptoms-some time ago . This , in turn , suggested that the Legionnaires ' bug had been around the district for a while . Hundreds of air and water samples were also checked for presence of the elusive bacteria . All tests proved negative , and the program has now been discontinued .
