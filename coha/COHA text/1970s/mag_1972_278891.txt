Although it is essential to studying the secrets of life , dissection of the dead was anathema to laymen for many centuries . Emperors and popes once forbade the practice , forcing physicians to utilize the services of body snatchers who , as late as the 19th century , obtained cadavers in midnight graveyard forays . One British ghoul , William Burke , was hanged in 1829 for creating instant specimens out of innocent wayfarers . As late as the 1960s , medical schools relied upon unclaimed bodies and found even these in short supply . <P> No more . Tens of thousands of Americans in recent years have decided to bequeath their bodies to science . The result is a body boom that is leaving schools and research labs in some parts of the country with more cadavers than they can dissect. * Medical schools in Illinois , which plan to use 360 bodies this year , have 390 on hand already and applications from 29,000 people who want to cooperate when the time conies . Ohio State University School of Medicine , which uses about 80 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University of Wisconsin Medical School , which uses fewer than 60 a year , has 5,000 potential donors on file . U.C.L.A. , with a list of 10,000 names , no longer accepts offers . Some centers have such an abundance that they accept only bodies in " good " condition . <P> The main reason for the surprising surplus is changing attitudes toward death and funerals . Many people are no longer concerned about religious strictures that bear on treatment of the dead . There is also a sense of altruism among the donors . Randy Beck , 22 , a student and former football player at the University of California at Los Angeles , says : " I 've willed my body to science because after I 'm done with it I wo n't have any use for it . There is no excuse to limit the usefulness of my body to my lifetime . " Some also decide in favor of dissection as a reaction to the expense and emotional upheaval of traditional burial rites . " My mother 's funeral was more like a circus than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Winslow , 25 , of Los Angeles . " I want more to come out of my death than just bills . " In choosing which institution will inherit their remains , most people pick one with which they have been associated . But whim is also a factor . A New York writer selected Harvard , he quips , because his parents always wanted him to go there and " this is the only way I could get in . " <P> Every state now has a law making it easier for people to donate their bodies or organs after death . In many states , anyone over 18 can , in the presence of witnesses , will his body or its parts to science ; in many cases , would-be donors are given identification cards to carry in their wallets . If they die naturally-so that no autopsy is required-their bodies are automatically turned over to recipient institutions .
