txt Mayor Kevin H. White lashed out at President Ford today for his antibusing statement yesterday , saying the President had " fanned the flames of resistance " to school integration and possibly contributed to the endangerment of Boston 's schoolchildren . Opponents of the court-ordered busing for integration here said they were " encouraged " by the President 's statement . The Mayor , tense , visibly tired and obviously holding his temper at times , said at an afternoon news conference that he would continue to enforce the law in Boston , but would not voluntarily implement a pending second phase involving expanded busing for integration without Federal support . The Mayor made the comments as 425 riot-equipped policemen came into the city at his request and took up stations on the streets of South Boston to help guard black children being bused into schools in the white ethnic community amid intense and occasionally violent opposition .

Mayor White , who yesterday requested and was denied 125 Federal marshals by a United States District Court here , issued his statement in response to comments in Washington by Mr. Ford yesterday . At a news conference Mr. Ford urged " the citizens of Boston to respect the law , " but he said that busing for integration was " not the best solution to quality education in Boston . " Mr. Ford said further that he believed Federal marshals were under the jurisdiction of the court , not the President , and that as far as he knew , " no specific request has come to me for any further Federal involvement . ' Asked about that assertion , Mayor White began in a rather sharp voice , then paused and said : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to join this battle . I take issue either with the President 's accuracy or his candor . " Mr. White conceded that it was " possible " that the President did not know of his request for Federal marshals , but he said that " for fully 20 minutes , a member of the Justice Department " argued in the court of Federal District Judge W. Arthur Garrity yesterday that the request probably would not be met . The President 's statement , he said , " is hard for me to accept . " At the same time that he deplored the President 's statement and the action of Judge Garrity in , denying the Federal marshals , Mayor White said . that he would not put National Guard troops on the streets of Boston .

" " Yesterday , " the Mayor 's prepared statement said , " while I was in court seeking Federal help to implement the court order desegregating Boston 's schools , the President of the United States ' was undermining that very order of the court . " He encouraged false hopes and fanned the flames of resistance that will almost inevitably lead to further disruption in Boston , and will endanger the safety of our school children in the process , " the statement said . " Today , " Mr. White said , " the message of the Federal Government to the Mayor and people of Boston , ? and to municipal officials across the country , is clear  --  you are on your own .

" Earlier today , Thomas Atkins , acting president of the National Association for Colored People , called Mr. Ford 's statement " irresponsible " and added : -r think it will probably lead to violence in Boston . " If so , he said , Mr. Ford would " share the responsibility . " The reaction of busing foes to Mr. Ford 's statement was favorable . A spokesman for the South Boston Information Center , an antihousing group , said in an interview before Mr. White 's press conference today : " We 're pleased with it . We were encouraged . We 're sending telegrams to the White House saying , you know , ' Thank you , we love you , ' things like that . Individual responses .
