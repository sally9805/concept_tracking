AN EMPTY WINDY SKY CREDITS OVER CLOSE SHOT . Its slender ebony handle is hooked round a bit of barbed wire , decorated with tufts of dirty sheep 's wool . Its fringed and tasselled canopy is of shantung silk , its lining of black French lace . MED SHOT .

It is caught again , but this time against the headstone of a grave . MED SHOT it bumps and jigs its way through the strange memorials of a rustic Irish calvary , a sort of stone walled sheep pen for the dead , set in barren moorland .

Birds soar in the up-draught there . The parasol leaps away , soars up with the birds , and parachutes down : A dizzying sweep of granite cliff towards a heaving grey sea . We see the parasol dwindling as it spirals erratically away , hear the grumble of the huge waves as they lurch against the rocks , sending up flumes and spires of foam . The parasol lands , a yellow speck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiny boat . CLOSE SHOT the boat is a curragh , of canvas on a frame of sticks . It looks shockingly primitive and fragile . But it rides like a leaf ; up into a world of white sky , then down into the shadowed valley between two walls of dark water . The oarsman , back towards us keeps it head to waves with small instinctive movements of the blades . The man in the stern rides the waves standing , hauling something heavy from the bottom of the sea . As we descend he gathers in the slack of the hairy plaited rope , then braces himself as the curragh rises towards the sky . He is making the waves do the work . The object surfaces . The man plucks it from the sea , turns and dumps it in the boat . A wattle lobster pot draped in seaweed . Now we can see that the man is a priest and wears a frayed black cassock kilted up with rope , a grubby clerical collar round his sinewy red neck . He is a big man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thought .

This is FATHER COLLINS , peasant priest ; a formidable father to his flock , an unbending disciplinarian but a wise and benevolent man , his flock is fortunate .

He draws the clattering monster deftly forth and looks cheerfully towards his companion , but : His companion , back towards us , is staring round at : His POV the parasol , upside down , its handle pointing jauntily sky-wards , floating smugly down the surface of a wave towards them . FATHER COLLINS holding the lobster stares , as at an apparition . The idiotic thing comes closer . His companion throws a weighted codline and captures it .

He takes from a blood-stained wooden box a fistful of butcher 's offal , rebaits the pot and chucks it back into the sea . The little float of cork with its stick and red rag is left in CLOSE SHOT for a second . Now he swills his hand in the sea and holds it out for the parasol . Solemnly , MICHAEL hands it to him . The priest , scowling , registers its extravagant allurements . He gives a rather sour small smile and says : &nbsp; FATHER COLLINSNo need t'ask who 's that is .

MICHAEL exhibits pleasurable excitement , at which the priest growls : &nbsp; FATHER COLLINSAll right , all right . ( collapses parasol ) Come on . MICHAEL bends to the oars ; one expert nonchalant sweep and they are moving off . He makes no more conscious effort than a fish makes to swim , going by instinct , still looking up at : The girl as before . Her name is ROSY . She wears an Edwardian college girl 's blouse , a long black skirt , neat buttoned boots . The effect is ruined by the addition of a homely woollen cardigan and an incongruous pair of black net gloves . She is about twenty years old , with a thin active body and vital face , but now looks down sullenly at who has rescued her parasol . We see her lips move in a silent curse .

Now a moment of fierce effort as he chooses his wave and rows frantically to keep the curragh balanced just forward of the crest .  --  5  --  View page imageIt seizes them ; his eyes shine as they are swept forward on a travelling wall of water . It collapses booming ; the boat is carried forward on the swill ; at exactly the same moment both men leap out and run through the water with the boat to where the last wavelet peters out .

The hard flat sand is skimmed with water , forming a gigantic mirror to reflect the travelling clouds so that the tiny figure of ROSY seems to be walking through the sky . A circus of seagulls banks and wheels about her head . CLOSE SHOT . ROSY is walking forward , going nowhere it would seem - were it not for the dead straight line she follows . But now her incurious gaze alights on the book in her hand . And there is the suggestion of a frown on her face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shoddy thing with its foolishly romantic cover print and with a fling of the arm she spins it away out into the breakers ; which swallow it up ; to ROSY 's satisfaction . She clasps her hands behind her back and walks on as before , glad to be freed from a slight unworthiness . But the sea brings it back . ROSY sees its glaring colours waving softly at her where it floats waterlogged in shallow water . Her footsteps veer to the water 's edge . Still with her hands behind her back she inserts her toe beneath it and with a flick of the foot tosses it back into deeper water . Her footsteps veer away to firmer sand , and she walks on . She looks ahead . With her we see the sweep of beach and the headland , figured with cloud shadows and sunfields . A field of sunlight speeds along the beach towards us , turning the sea from grey to vivid green and white , warming the sand . Engulfed in sunshine , ROSY is caught up in the authentic causeless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horses gallop for no reason and sets a young retriever chasing leaves . She chuckles , sends her parasol spinning recklessly into the wind , chases and catches it , and is pleased by her own skill . Now a gliding black shadow on the sand before her . She looks up . A single seagull rides the wind , effortless , at home . With the light behind  --  13  --  it the bird is almost transparently white . MUSIC - " Wings " theme . We see every feather , and the turn of the alert sleek head with its bright black eye . ROSY glides after the drifting shadow , to capture it , unconsciously identifying with the bird . It becomes a chase . She moves away from us swiftly - and is enveloped in the shadow which comes speeding up the beach as another cloud crosses the sun . The shadow-seagull is swallowed up in the colder light and the bird itself gives a single cry and wheels away as though it knew the game were over . MUSIC modulates as ROSY looks at her watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She unbuttons her cardigan and peels it from her , revealing a fine white blouse , neat and schoolmarmish but closely fitting ; she glances down at herself technically , looks again at her watch , takes the parasol and moves . A little country bus rattles to a halt in LONG SHOT at a bleak moorland road junction . This is Killin 's Cross where the third-class coastroad strikes inland and a fourth-class road leads on to the village . The junction is marked by an ancient , leaning , Celtic Cross . A man gets off the bus carrying a bag and stick . The bus leaves . The man strikes off along a footpath , tiny , the only thing moving . The alternation of cloud shadow and sunfield continues . ROSY places her cardigan on a dry rock and weights it with a big flat stone . She moves off again , this time purposefully , leaving footprints in the sand , the light changes continuing there .

He is a tall man in his early forties , strongly built and agreeably featured - his best features being the eyes which are warm and kindly , though hidden now by silver rimmed spectacles .

In kneeling , he discloses to the CAMERA the pattern of hob-nails and tips on the soles of his boots . These humble devices glint dramatically in the dull light . CLOSE SHOT , ROSY is looking down intently at : The pattern of hob-nails and tips left by his big boots in the sand . One of ROSY 's bare feet is placed in it , carefully . Then another in the next . She pauses . Her face is serious ; she looks cautiously up and about ; she does not want to be seen . She takes another step ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another step . She notes the sensual curl of the extruded sand from beneath her sole . Her eyes darken . On the incoming tide a shallow wave comes skimming up the beach and swirls about her feet . She stays exactly where she is , her feet in his prints - but now she can not see them , surrounded by the shift and drift of foam and water , and it makes her balance , dizzily with outstretched arms , like a tight-rope walker in danger of falling .

CHARLES passes into the pub , leaving him standing and : Enters the pub where the red lobster lies on the bar , to cheerful greetings from RYAN , FATHER COLLINS , McCARDLE and FRIEND , creating a stir ad lib . McCARDLE is a dark , sharp-featured man , the same age as RYAN , in whose shadow he lives . He somewhat resents this , knowing himself to be shrewder and more serious , though less noisy . With the menfolk the quiet good-humour of CHARLES ' manner with ROSY degenerates to something like timidity . Rather foolishly smiles round : &nbsp; CHARLESHome is the voyager , safe from the sea . . . &nbsp; RYANThe usual ? &nbsp; CHARLESOh . Thanks . &nbsp; RYAN ( pouring small beer , lowers voice , significant ) And - What did you see in Dublin ? CHARLES glances round nervously .

With him we see the headline : " HEAVY ALLIED CASUALTIES " . His lips go tight . Beneath the headline we see a Press Picture of the Western Front , a static nightmare of mud ploughed and reploughed by bombardment , shattered trees , a skeletal building , freshly arrived troops grinning forlornly for the camera . RYAN grins slyly from the CORPORAL where he stands arrested , to McCARDLE and FRIEND . &nbsp; RYANIt seems the Jerries are givin ' your brave lads out there a terrible scrimmage , then ? &nbsp; CORPORALAye .

DRIVER jumps out of the cab onto the sand , face changes to alarm as he sees something ; then with a cheery grin and violent warning thump with his fist on the cab door sings out loudly : &nbsp; DRIVERThe top of the mornin ' , Father !

( simulated disappointment ) But FATHER COLLINS is looking curiously at MICHAEL backing towards them from the lorry . His colleague is discovered then ; DRIVER raises voice . &nbsp; DRIVERThe Father says it all gets carried round the Head , Tim ! MATE hesitates , leans reluctantly round rear of lorry . &nbsp; MATEAh so . ( nods ) Father . ( withdraws ) DRIVER deflects their curious attention .

DRIVER laughs heartily and PRIEST , delighted with his own humour , going : Try your hand in Killins Bay . &nbsp; DRIVERWe 'll do that , Father , thanks ! MATE lets fall the flap through which he watches the three locals go . Turns . Exchanges a smile with DRIVER , his rather wry , DRIVER 's contemptuous .

CUT Section Details A GOVERNESS-CART - SHINY WITH NEW PAINT AND RUSTLING AND FLUTTERING A governess-cart , shiny with new paint and rustling and fluttering with white ribbons and white flowers , a white linen sheet over the seat and floorboards , pulled by a small white pony whose mane and tail and harness are similarly alive with white favours . The pony 's head is held by RYAN , sweating in a heavy black suit , a huge bunch of lily-of-the-valley nodding in his buttonhole . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the pub .

And disappears . &nbsp; RYANWomen . . . He consults his watch , then addressing McCARDLE and FRIEND who stand holding two similar , less sumptuously decorated pony carts :  --  49  --  &nbsp; RYANWell what about it , lads ? - Inside the pub , DRIVER is at the bar , MATE looking out , hearing : " - Could you stand another ?

Together they stare at a blurred photograph among the bits and bottles behind the bar . It shows a line of amateur soldiers , mostly in uniform , some with rifles . Before them stands a portly figure shaking hands with a Senior Officer . &nbsp; RYAN ( entering noisily ) Aha ! - You 're lookin ' at my picture , boys . Here - He comes behind the bar , takes the picture from its place and offers it to their closer scrutiny while he busies himself with bottles and glasses and : &nbsp; RYAND'you recognise someone ? They do indeed ; we see with them that the Senior Officer and MATE are the same . They are frozen for a second not daring to look up , then DRIVER with mock admiration : &nbsp; DRIVERIt 's yourself , Landlord . &nbsp; RYANIt is .

RYAN leans towards them . As one about to communicate a state secret , narrow-eyed : &nbsp; RYANI 'll tell you somethin ' . . . But he is interrupted by a rush of footsteps and excited feminine murmurs from behind the communicating door , and MRS McCARDLE puts her head in to say , as if she , not he , had been waiting : &nbsp; MRS MCCARDLECome on then , Mr Ryan . &nbsp; RYANRight ma'am !  --  51  --  Bangs down glass and is following McARDLE and FRIEND out when he takes in the immobile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottle , stoops over the bar and tucks it away . turns at the door : &nbsp; RYANNow lads , I know what 's here , down to the last dram . &nbsp; DRIVERBe easy , landlord - An ' good luck to the young lady . The door swings to . MATE looks quietly , seeing in the dim mirror behind the bar the reflection of the three little carts go past the window in a flutter of white , their hoofbeats receding .

Now he hears on SOUND the Tinker 's lorry approach . Are they coming too ? He rises and goes to the porch to welcome them , the responses continuing . But is in time to see : His POV from the porch , a litter of parked carts and traps , the bridal conveyance prominent . The Tinkers ' lorry passes and goes away , receding to silence . Now MICHAEL hears a shuffling and clumping from behind him , turns back to see : His POV the villagers rising and sitting in a sinking wave of Sunday finery .

CLOSE SHOT , ROSY turns and we see her face for the first time ; she looks composed and very happy . &nbsp; FATHER COLLINS- or else for ever hold his peace . CUT Night . In the courtyard at the rear of the pub , a big fire is burning and in its lurid light the sweating dancers - YOUNG MEN and WOMEN - caper and display themselves to one another , their eyes too bright , their faces set with effort . MICHAEL , who can not dance , stands apart , watching dazedly : His POV , the lurid glow and leaping shadows , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in foreground and  --  53  --  background . But an area of stillness where the bridal couple sits , black and white in a pool of cool light . CLOSE SHOT , CHARLES his hair and shoulders still sprinkled with confetti , ROSY is talking quietly to her father . CHARLES is watching : Two pairs of dancers break off exhausted , their lungs working like bellows and hand in hand , laughing , pass the three FIDDLERS and enter the barn . The two GIRLS get beer from the barrel for their partners but one of the two young men glances towards the isolated groom at the head of the table , deserted now except for those too old to dance . He nudges his friend , both look covertly towards CHARLES , the first half turns his back to whisper something and both laugh . CHARLES has seen the incident . He looks quickly towards ROSY and finds : ROSY happily beating time with her hands . CHARLES joins in and has some difficulty in finding the rapid rhythm of : CLOSE SHOT the FIDDLERS , gnome-like persons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FIDDLER expertly eyeing the festivity . In the barn MRS McCARDLE is dispensing drinks from a vast jug to those still seated . CHARLES hesitates then takes it like medicine . ROSY drinks joyously ; she is in high spirits , perhaps too high . But : McCARDLE takes a discreet glance at his watch and grins a covert question at CHARLES , makes a barely perceptible motion of the head towards the house . ROSY has seen it . High spirits are replaced by a much more serious vein of feeling , not unmixed with fear . She puts down her glass and keeps her eyes on the table cloth before her . CHARLES cautiously pushes back his chair . He would like to be invisible , but : FIRST FIDDLER 's practised eye discerns a movement in the barn . Instantly he breaks off and rattles his bow against his fiddle . His assistants follow suit . At the signal :  --  54  --  DANCERS come to rest , at first wondering and irritated , then seeing : CHARLES and RYAN risen , ROSY rising . She looks up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sweet slow melody on his single instrument , to a murmur of laughter and a flutter of applause from the DANCERS . Now ROSY approaches them . They part for her . She sees : Their sweating faces , heaving chests , hearing their deep breaths . Her gaze becomes a little uncertain as she registers : The fixed predatory stares of the males . She looks about for : Her POV , FATHER COLLINS at the table . His back is towards her ; he is looking at his glass , turning it in his fingers ; the good man is presumably lost in serious thought . She goes to him gladly , and softly , respectfully : &nbsp; ROSYGood night , Father Hugh . He glances round and rises , supports himself on the table and staring at her with conscious effort from a reddened face , raises an unsteady hand and heartily : &nbsp; FATHER COLLINSGoo ' night , Rosy . . . ! ROSY has a moment of pure shock ; then gives him a quick smile and goes on again between the DANCERS , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1ST FIDDLERWell is no-body goin ' to kiss the Bride ?  --  55  --  A YOUNG MAN laughs , hastily wipes his sweating mouth with his sleeve and plants himself in front of her . She smiles and offers her cheek . He kisses it . And at once there is a rush of men , jostling round her as she laughs and tries to satisfy all comers . CLOSE SHOT , MICHAEL can not understand why everyone is kissing ROSY - surely the ultimate privilege . Then it dawns on him that for some reason on this occasion it is permitted . At first hesitatingly but then with fierce frantic eagerness he thrusts his way among the boisterous YOUNG MEN . But when his mindlessly excited face appears among them : CLOSE SHOT ROSY checks appalled . MICHAEL stares back , his frenetic grin fading , and : RYAN is already a little worried that the thing is getting out of hand : half - laughing : &nbsp; RYANNow steady boys , steady - ( and when he sees Michael ) Get off out of it - ! And shoves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the ground at CHARLES ' feet . &nbsp; CHARLESAre you all right , Michael ? &nbsp; BRIDESMAIDSure he 's all right - I 'll give him a kiss - She suits the action to the word , stooping down to him . She puts her crown of white daisies on his head . " Kindly " amidst hilarity : There , Michael . CHARLES smiles a bit uncertainly , finding the rough humour hard to take . Then looking off his face changes , seeing : The struggle for ROSY has become quite ugly . Through the heaving pack of YOUNG MEN he catches one glimpse of her face , breathless still laughing but a bit scared . CHARLES presses through realizes he must use force and does . Gaining ROSY he supports her then swiftly and effortlessly picks  --  56  --  her up and thrusting clear of the scrum with his back carries her to the rear door of the pub , RYAN following . Half-jeering half-admiring laughter . She looks at him glowingly , then goes in , her father after . CHARLES turns , to find FATHER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of goodwill . &nbsp; FATHER COLLINSWell lucky man - an ' how are you feeling ? &nbsp; CHARLESLucky . The priest looks at him , puts a hand inaccurately on his shoulder . &nbsp; FATHER COLLINSNow , now , now - Lucky be damned - she 's yours ! Inside the pub ROSY is half way up the stairs . RYAN looking up : &nbsp; RYANAre you all right , Princess ? &nbsp; ROSYAh - it 's only their bit of fun . . . She registers the stupid anxious upturned face , descends a step or two : Good night , Father . She kisses him and goes on up . He looks after her . &nbsp; RYANGood night , Rosy . The priest propels CHARLES toward the pub door with heavy-handed benevolence : &nbsp; FATHER COLLINSAway in with you - ! RYAN emerges looking gloomy . An awkward confrontation . Then prosaic as though checking the arrangements for a social function :  --  57  --  &nbsp; RYANYou 'll be away early , in the mornin ' , I suppose . &nbsp; CHARLESWe will , yes , Mr Ryan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LONG SHOT the bedroom , the double bed . The light virginal save for the red glow at the curtained window . ROSY by the door . On SOUND she hears CHARLES enter below and close the outer door . She cocks her head . No further sound . She moves to turn up the oil lamp by the window . MICHAEL in his crown of daisies looks up ; with him we see the curtains fill with the light , as FIDDLERS strike into a reckless jig . ROSY undresses , the fiddles on SOUND , the leaping feet on the cobbles . CHARLES contemplates his face dubiously in the mirror of the hall hat stand . The DANCERS in the yard more abandoned than before , partners eyeing each other with open sexuality . ROSY is one instant naked , then enveloped in a nightdress . It was got for the occasion , of translucent Irish lawn . She looks at herself in the mirror and is pleased . Now CHARLES ' footsteps mount the stairs . Shall he see her thus ? No , as by magic she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chin . CHARLES enters . He closes the door gently . His quiet movements are in grateful contrast to the hectic festive din which reaches the room from outside . He looks towards the bed almost as towards an altar . Then smiles very gently and happily as he crosses . Her upturned face on the pillow is full of love and trust as he approaches . Gently he stoops and kisses her . Suddenly her arms are tight about his neck and she is kissing him in good earnest . He draws back involuntarily , then lets her kiss him , but still stooped awkwardly from the waist . When she lets him go he smiles at her . She smiles back , taking her cue from him , confident that she has only to follow him in everything . She watches him : Begin to undress . But then , thinking not to embarrass her , he goes quietly and naturally behind the screen where her own bridal garments hang . ROSY looks up , timid but joyous at :  --  58  --  The ceiling above her head ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little stool behind the screen and takes off his shoes ; thump . . . thump . His fingers tremble a little . ROSY looks at the screen again ; she has heard that double thump a thousand times in her father 's house , but never under these circumstances ; her sense of approaching her life 's crisis deepens ; a moment of thoughtfulness . The MUSIC and festivities outside , on SOUND , are more abandoned than ever now , the locally accepted nuptial mode . CHARLES gets into his night-shirt , emerges from the screen and sees : ROSY has thrown back the covers and lies still , revealed in her insubstantial night-dress . CHARLES is fractionally checked but deftly moves on in the same split-instant so that we may have imagined it . Carefully he turns down the oil-lamp . ROSY watching has a moment of uncertainty ; has she done the wrong thing ? As the pale flame in the white glass bell goes down and the room sinks into darkness , the glow at the window accentuated , the fiddle music is overlain by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the courtyard looking up : CHARLES turns from the window . Pauses ; laughs , a little breathlessly : &nbsp; CHARLESThem lads has an elegant sense of humour . ROSY looks , then responds with an uncertain smile which quickly fades ; why does n't he come to her , exposed as she is ? The wedding dress slithers from its hanger , the silk sighing . ROSY looks quickly at CHARLES . Let him not go for it , let him come to her now . But he goes and rescues the dress .  --  59  --  ROSY feels that she has been absurd and may be thrusting ; shamedly she pulls the covers back again while CHARLES is busy with the dress . CHARLES comes and gets into bed by her . Her eyes follow his every movement . He looks down at her upturned face with wonderment , hesitates , and kisses her . She responds but this time cautiously ; the proper pace is evidently slower than she had thought . Now both are startled by a swish and crash against the window . Through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the night to clatter against the glass . In the firelit yard among the shadows , is a bin of maize corn . Hands grab the big gold pellets . The DRUNKS hurl handfuls up against the window . MICHAEL still wearing his white coronet looks on bewildered , trying to puzzle out the place of this activity in the proceedings ; drunken laughter ; he catches on - it is a joke . He moves towards the bin and seizes an enormous handful . It arrives with a splendid crash . CHARLES is lying on his back with ROSY on her side against him , face half hidden . They hear the voice of RYAN : &nbsp; RYAN ( off ) Come away lads - Easy does it - CHARLES and ROSY hear one last crash and RYAN angry : " Now come away ! " then mumbled protests at his lack of sportsmanship and silence . The fiddles sound suddenly louder . CHARLES relaxes , turns his face to hers . She looks at him ; a beat ; he kisses her ; she closes her eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards the window . MOUREEN 's eyes burn into him . FIRST FIDDLER playing like a demon , looking like a demon , glances up over his flying bow towards the window , and : ROSY and CHARLES profile to profile . She kisses him . And in a single accelerating rush passion overwhelms the too-long isolated , introverted man . He draws her towards him , there is a movement beneath the covers , he mounts her . ROSY is startled by his suddenness and strength and weight but composes herself . And then a moment of pure shock . And now she is  --  60  --  merely suffering it bravely while the expression of CHARLES ' opposed profile is of helpless , sexual possession , his face caught by the hot glow from the window . The DANCERS sweat at their exertions in the restless firelight ; the screen taken over by movement everywhere , nothing without life . From passive suffering ROSY is roused . Her arms appear and wind about his neck , her eyes glow , close , open , begin to approach ecstacy - And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . He pulls away his head , rolls softly sideways , she still clinging to him , kissing him again before she registers that he has finished . She draws away slowly , her body distraught , herself humiliated . LONG SHOT between the spinning DANCERS affords a glimpse of FATHER COLLINS with a hand on RYAN 's shoulder , affectionately and vigorously encouraging him . RYAN downcast . The Priest inaccurately fills their glasses from a bottle . CHARLES rouses from his exhaustion , turns quickly to her , concerned , and gives her a kiss of love without passion . She touches his cheek quickly and turns right away on the pillow . CLOSE SHOT ROSY thus , her eyes staring , dreadfully awake , hearing on SOUND the DANCERS only now accelerating towards their climax . A rustle and movement and CHARLES ' face appears , peering at her anxiously . She closes her eyes . He must reassure himself with this . He turns away , lays down his head and closes his eyes too . But they open . He is worried and unhappy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . TWO SHOT shows them both , turned away from each other like faces on a coin . CUT CLOSE SHOT , grey morning , a drift of yesterday 's confetti circles in the gutter of the village street , a strong wind blowing . On SOUND the distant church bell chimes . CLOSE SHOT . In the belfry the distant chime is a sudden shattering boom , and FATHER COLLINS , pulling on the rope , has a bad hangover . He closes his eyes , heroically pulls again ; again the bell roars ; he murmurs a short blessing on himself against the pain - and pulls again .  --  61  --  The priest 's martydom continues distantly on SOUND as McCARDLE stumbles to the door of the pub . He needs a shave , his lilies-of-the-valley are crushed and wilted , he looks terrible . He sees the circling confetti . His bloodshot eyes follow the motion for a spell . Then he pulls them away , on the brink of nausea and looks off wincing at the SOUND of iron tyres on cobbles . It is ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little pony cart , the bridegroom , morning-fresh and confident . Hopping down he calls : &nbsp; CHARLESMorning , Mrs Casey ! OLD WOMAN nods , non-committal , sidles along the wall to knock with the back of her hand on the next cottage door , still watching : CHARLES going into the pub gives McCARDLE a little easy laugh and a pat . ANOTHER WOMAN comes to the cottage door . OLD WOMAN folds her arms and nods towards the pub , her expression sly . MICHAEL sidles into shot ; they ignore him ; all watching : CHARLES emerging with two cases ; he plumps them in the cart and straightens the worn rug on the seat . OLD WOMAN suddenly tense , nudges her companion . They are watching : ROSY coming out after CHARLES . She looks perfectly composed . Climbs onto the seat with her husband 's assistance . OLD WOMAN , peering with naked curiosity , in a voice full of wheedling good-will and secret impudence : &nbsp; OLD WOMANGood morning , Mrs Shaughnessy . . . ? &nbsp; ROSYGood morning ! She sings it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WOMEN look after her doubtfully , reserving judgement . MICHAEL looks after them too . Then bends to his task . He is carefully and conscientiously scraping together the dirty confetti from the gutter and putting it into a paper bag . CUT  --  62  --  LONG SHOT ROSY and CHARLES crossing the school playground , where a scrap of paper and flying grit circle in the wind which is really violent here . ROSY comes ON FRAME , followed by CHARLES with the two cases . The wind seems to blow them about , crossing the playground . ROSY has CHARLES ' key-ring and opens the door . Inside the kitchen CHARLES shuts the door . We see a small pile of bags and cases , the bride 's belongings . ROSY is standing in the living-room . She looks about quickly as though she had never seen it before , her eyes cautious in her pale face . And when CHARLES enters she looks at him in the same way , as though he were a stranger who had somehow abducted her and whose nature was yet to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A confrontation . Home . The cold wind whistles outside . &nbsp; CHARLESI - I got these for you - He picks up and shows her something which we can not see , gently drawing a damp muslin cloth from it , revealing it to her . When she sees it her face shows surprise , then soft delight . It is a forest of snowdrops embedded in moss in a , shallow earthenware oven bowl ; the delicate bells tremble . She lifts a flap of moss disclosing earth and : &nbsp; CHARLESThey 're all growin ' see . . . &nbsp; ROSYCharles - when did you do it ? &nbsp; CHARLESLast thing yesterday - Before I come to Church . She takes it from him , kisses him , turns and puts it on the table . &nbsp; ROSYYou 're a rare man . He blinks with happiness . She , briskly , little housewife :  --  63  --  &nbsp; ROSYWell now - She bustles into kitchen and emerges with one of the cases . &nbsp; CHARLESHere - &nbsp; ROSY- It 's not heavy - And passes through to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . After all , we feel , a bad first night can be overcome . And CHARLES , looking at her from the bedroom doorway , is certainly a happy man . &nbsp; CHARLESI - I ca n't believe you 're here , you know . &nbsp; ROSY ( by the bed looks at him ) Well I am : It is the sweetest possible invitation , but an invitation without doubt . She holds out her hand . He goes and takes it . Kisses her , but then cheerfully : &nbsp; CHARLESWell now ! And bustles briskly from the room , leaving ROSY staring after him , first sadly , then thoughtfully , then back to a deeper sadness . On SOUND from living-room a click and a whirr and amplified scraping . ROSY sees through the bedroom door , as the gravely lyrical MUSIC comes over her : CHARLES stooping to make up a fire in the grate , working with deft masculine efficiency , MUSIC over . ROSY sits on the bed by her case , the sensuous MUSIC pouring over her . She raises her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , smiles , and says as though he had given her something : &nbsp; CHARLESBeethoven . . . ! She smiles faintly , then blinking and thoughtful , looks about :  --  64  --  The furnishings and drab wallpaper of the room . In one place , she sees , the paper is curling away from the wall . DISSOLVE Section Details MUSIC CONTINUOUS OVER MUSIC continuous over : The paper replaced with one of brighter pattern , fresh lace mats on the furnishings , a new bed-spread , woodwork painted . A similar transformation in the living room - the same items of furniture , but all repaired and cared for , ceiling whitewashed , walls re-papered , oil lamp shining on bright new curtains . ROSY is differently dressed and seated in one of the easy chairs , head bent , sewing . CHARLES in waistcoat and shirtsleeves , has before him on the table a large book bearing the words , very neatly lettered : " Flaura of the Parish of Kirrary . Collected by Charles Shaughnessy , Dip . Ed . " Now he takes a folded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a glass of water and places it between the folds . His movements are finicking - necessarily , but still , finicking - and more so by contrast with the now thundering symphonic MUSIC . ROSY pauses at her work and looks across at him , thoughtfully . CHARLES has the blotting paper between the pages of an enormous dictionary . He closes it and adds another volume with a thump . ROSY twitches faintly , bends quickly to her work , but : CHARLES has registered the movement . He looks towards her , a bit thoughtfully clears away his scissors , etc . Then sits in the other easy chair . Pause . Then he smiles . &nbsp; CHARLESI - I do n't think you much care for me flowers , do you ? &nbsp; ROSYI like ' em better growing , surely . &nbsp; CHARLESAye well they 're better growin ' of course . Another pause . The record comes to its end . The needle scratches loud and repetitive in the groove , over which : DISSOLVE A spade cuts into the tough earth of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turf has been loosened by the heavy pick-axe  --  65  --  which lies there , and the hands on the haft of the spade are strong ; so too the bare arms which drive it , and the chest and shoulders above , and altogether CHARLES , face sweating , the muscles of his bare and hairy torso tensed , a red kerchief round his neck , and belted corduroys and heavy boots on legs and feet , looks splendid . ROSY thinks so too , watching him from the window . She looks curious . And now knocks on the window gladly , and pulls out one of the dining chairs before a pot and tea-cup nicely laid , and generally fusses . And turns quite demure and faintly excited at the clump of his boots in the kitchen . He enters blowing ruefully , a big man in the little place . &nbsp; CHARLES ( apologetically ) You 'll not be in time for snap-dragons . &nbsp; ROSY ( smiling , holding his chair for him ) I 'll put in some lillies . I like them . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? &nbsp; CHARLESI want my shirt . It hangs just beyond her . &nbsp; ROSYAh - You 're fine as you are . She says it off-hand but her accompanying smile of pride and admiration makes it a clear compliment and CHARLES laughing a bit awkwardly : &nbsp; CHARLESAll right - And sits . But is uncomfortable . One hand on chest and glancing towards door , pleading : &nbsp; CHARLESNo , Rosy , what if someone came - &nbsp; ROSYOh , Charles - You 're always on about if someone comes .  --  66  --  &nbsp; CHARLES ( a bit indignant ) Well it 's not decent . &nbsp; ROSYAh - decent ! &nbsp; CHARLESWell it 's not ! &nbsp; ROSYAll right then ! Picks up the shirt and throws it to - almost at - him . He catches it but stares at her shocked and hurt . Remorse engulfs her for the ugly action . In a low voice : &nbsp; ROSYI - I 'm sorry dear . Go on , put it on . And he instantly , as chiding himself for making a fuss over a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it matter ? &nbsp; ROSYNo you 're right ; put it on . &nbsp; CHARLESWell , I 'll be out again in a minute . . . And puts it over the back of his chair . ROSY joins him at the table . Mutual apology and good-will will take them no further . In utter silence she pours tea for the bare-chested man , neither looking at the other . In the silence a mindless rhythmical chant is heard over : DISSOLVE The schoolroom . CHARLES conducting his small charges with a ruler , listening intently for any faltering or inaccuracy . And the CHILDREN look back at him with the same intensity , anxious for his approval . In the front row , the grubby LITTLE GIRL who bounced the ball begins to look uneasy as the numbers get more difficult . CHARLES goes to her , bends closely so that he can hear her faltering voice beneath the choral chant and gently prompts her through the final stages .  --  67  --  &nbsp; CHILDREN . . . six sevens are forty-two , six eights are forty-eight , six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number , then triumphantly : ) six tens are sixty , six elevens are sixty-six , six twelves are . . .

CHARLES , performing this simple work of instruction mechanically , looks off towards : The communicating door with its brass know . The LITTLE GIRL looks up at him .

CUT MUSIC ( " Wings , " but now uneasy , pricking , uncomfortable . ) CLOSE SHOT . ROSY is seated almost motionless by the gaunt remains of a ruined boat drawn into a dark and glistening gulley of the cliff . Her back is to the sunlit beach . She wears a high-necked blouse of hot red ; her hair is piled . She breathes like someone sleeping . She pulls gently at a coil of seaweed like wet yellow satin round her wrist . As it slithers off she coils it again ; the movement is mindless and sensual . Her vacant eyes regard : The trickling water which wets the shadowy surfaces of her hiding place . She raises her head slightly . Her eyes have darkened , her mouth slackened , her expression corrupt . But MUSIC cuts on a sort of gasp as natural sounds crash back with a heavy tread on pebbles and a harsh voice : &nbsp; FATHER COLLINSDreamin ' Rosy ? She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He regards her seriously from the sunlight , holding an awkward paper parcel underneath one arm . She turns away again , defiant . &nbsp; ROSYAn ' if I am ? He crosses the shadow line and looks around . &nbsp; FATHER COLLINSIf you are , you 've chosen a dark place for it . Dressed fine for it , too .  --  69  --  &nbsp; ROSYYou 'd rather I dressed foul ? &nbsp; FATHER COLLINSI 'd rather you dressed sensible . An ' did something useful . Like lookin ' after your house an ' your man . &nbsp; ROSY ( indignant ) My house is fine ! &nbsp; FATHER COLLINSAye ' t'is . How 's your man ? &nbsp; ROSYFather Hugh I - I do n't want to talk to you . &nbsp; FATHER COLLINSI 've noticed . Keep yourself to yourself these days , do n't you ? &nbsp; ROSYWhen I can . His eyes snap at the pert reply , but he senses more serious matters afoot . It is quite gently that he comes forward and unwraps the seaweed from her wrist . &nbsp; FATHER COLLINSNow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , warmed by her flesh . He looks at the voluptuous stuff and casts it from him angrily , roughly wiping his palm on his cassock . And when he sees that she is wiping her wrist with a movement unconsciously fond he reddens with anger and disgust and : &nbsp; FATHER COLLINSCome out into the light . And as she shows fight : Come on now - out of it ! She obeys ; in the sunlight : That 's better is n't it ?  --  70  --  &nbsp; ROSY ( quietly ) Yes of course it is . &nbsp; FATHER COLLINS ( walking her ) How long have you an ' Charles been married ? &nbsp; ROSYYou know how long . &nbsp; FATHER COLLINS ( sharp ) I 'm askin ' you . &nbsp; ROSYEight months ! &nbsp; FATHER COLLINSAn ' what 's the trouble ? &nbsp; ROSYNo " trouble " . &nbsp; FATHER COLLINSAre you askin ' me to believe you 're happy ? &nbsp; ROSYI 'm not askin ' you anythin ' . &nbsp; FATHER COLLINS ( exasperated ) Are you happy ? &nbsp; ROSYNo ! &nbsp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; ROSY . . . I do n't know . &nbsp; FATHER COLLINS ( impatient ) Ah come on Rosy , give me a try .  --  71  --  &nbsp; ROSYI do n't . &nbsp; FATHER COLLINS ( contemptuous impatience : ) Ach . &nbsp; ROSYAll right because I 'm stupid , and conceited and self-centred and ungrateful - like you 've always told me - for I 've everythin ' I wanted have I not ? &nbsp; FATHER COLLINSYou have . What more are you wantin ' now ? He has stopped and faced her . She pauses and more desolate then angry : &nbsp; ROSY . . . I do n't know that either . &nbsp; FATHER COLLINS ( after due consideration : ) That 's a lie . &nbsp; ROSY ( surprised ) I do n't know . ( then : ) I do n't know - How can I know - ? - ( desperate : ) I do n't even know what more there is ! He gives her one sharp glance , sees her emotion is sincere and that the situation is the more serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COLLINSNow listen to me . You 've got a good man . Have n't you ? &nbsp; ROSYThe best . This too is sincere - and the tone is of admission not pride . It is even worse than he feared ; he begins to feel helpless , therefore angry . We hear the anger rising in his exasperated catechism : &nbsp; FATHER COLLINSWell - ? - An ' you 've got enough money - Not much , but enough ?  --  72  --  &nbsp; ROSYYes . &nbsp; FATHER COLLINSAnd you 've got your health - you 're not sick ? &nbsp; ROSYNo . &nbsp; FATHER COLLINSWell there is nothin ' more ' - you graceless girl ! &nbsp; ROSY ( quiet determination , serving notice on herself and Life ) There is . &nbsp; FATHER COLLINS ( with desperate vehemence ) There is not ! &nbsp; ROSYI know there is ! There must be , Father Hugh ! There are sudden tears in her eyes ; it has come from the depths and what is worse she is appealing to him ; he is appalled - and furious : &nbsp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why must there be ? Because Rosy Ryan wants it ? &nbsp; ROSY ( stares , then passionately ) Yes ! He stares . She stares back . An ancient confrontation - imperative need and " Thou shalt not " . A pause and then he hits her , dropping his parcel . It bursts , disgorging a pathetic collection of old woollen garments , cast off underclothes , a pair of broken shoes . One beat in which they confront each other , then first ROSY and then the PRIEST go slowly down and get the parcel more or less together and back into his arms . &nbsp; FATHER COLLINSHave you any warm old clothes , Rosy ? Poor Patsy Wheelan 's in a bad way . &nbsp; ROSYI 'll find somethin ' , Father .  --  73  --  They rise .

The insignificant bus crossing the moor to Killins Cross . On SOUND Wind . PANNING with the slowing bus we come upon MICHAEL , grubbing in the sour bog land with his hands . CLOSE SHOT , he is gathering marsh marigolds . One blackened paw already holds a bunch of the delicate golden flowers . On SOUND the bus has stopped . He looks curiously at : His POV , the stationary bus . Activity on its further side . It draws away , leaving behind a solitary figure , quite motionless on the raised road , some luggage a few yards distant . MICHAEL is consumed with bovine curiosity . He moves . We see his boots , like lumps of earth , go clump and slither through the puddled grasses . Approaching he sees : The figure wears a British warm overcoat , stained and dry cleaned to the colour of stone but beautifully cut , perfect breeches and glittering boots with spurs . Registering MICHAEL 's approach he turns to watch . MICHAEL comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an animal or infant . The face that looks back at him is fine but very pale and tired , and too composed ; such composure does not go with such striking eyes , and the stillness of the athletic figure feels imposed . He too looks steadily and openly at MICHAEL , but with the steadiness of the detached . MICHAEL is almost open-mouthed ; his gaze travels carefully down the figure ; as though the man were some absolutely unidentifiable object . And suddenly he is riveted . MUSIC ( " Michael 's day " - a sort of jerky honky-tonk . ) RANDOLPH has moved towards his luggage . And his feet in their immaculate boots have exactly the crippled rhythm of MICHAEL 's own . He stoops and takes a silver cigarette case from a pocket of his valise . He lights one carefully and puts away the case in the pocket of his uniform jacket looking back at MICHAEL who :  --  74  --  Watches every movement as though storing it in memory . Now RANDOLPH looks away up the road . MICHAEL looks in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the direction of the village . MICHAEL looks to see what he will do ; he does nothing , standing stockstill as on SOUND the lorry draws up and : CORPORAL gets out , flustered , even frightened . He salutes . &nbsp; CORPORALMajor Doryan , sir ? RANDOLPH nods ; CORPORAL a bit unnerved by the steady inexpressive regard : &nbsp; CORPORALSorry sir ; had to change a wheel . He indicates the guilty wheel with one stiff arm , still to attention expecting reprimand but RANDOLPH looks at the wheel seriously , then towards his bags at which . &nbsp; CORPORALSir ! Snaps into life and begins to load cases . As he works he steals little curious glances at the officer who is looking now over the landscape but has n't moved . MICHAEL watches with deep interest . Lifting the last case CORPORAL checks , seeing : RANDOLPH limps quickly towards the cab . CORPORAL slings last case aboard and goes and opens cab door for him RANDOLPH calculates the movement one split second and then is up and seated even as the CORPORAL is offering him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat . Slips the gear . MICHAEL mouths indignantly from roadside . CORPORAL hesitates , glancing at RANDOLPH , then ventures : &nbsp; CORPORALHe wants a lift into the village , sir . RANDOLPH looks towards MICHAEL then forward again . CORPORAL takes this for refusal , lets in round MICHAEL and drives off , MICHAEL watching the cab . RANDOLPH :  --  75  --  &nbsp; RANDOLPHStop . &nbsp; CORPORAL ( obeying ) Sir ? MICHAEL sees the lorry stop and goes clump and drag up the road after it . CORPORAL , twisted round in seat , looks back and then to RANDOLPH who has not moved , hearing the clump and drag and then the thump as MICHAEL grasps the tailboard ; his heavy breathing . RANDOLPH turns his head . Unsmiling but gently : &nbsp; RANDOLPHGet in . MICHAEL stares back uncomprehending . &nbsp; CORPORALIn ! MICHAEL shins in with the agility of a monkey and seats himself behind them , staring cautiously at the back of RANDOLPH 's head as the lorry moves off again . &nbsp; CORPORALDoes np ' arm sir , does it ? An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cr- He breaks off appalled . But RANDOLPH is looking pleasantly out of the window , as not having heard . They progress in awkward silence . Then RANDOLPH 's head turns , as though drawn , and he looks idly at : The bright flowers in the gloom of the lorry , bobbing in MICHAEL 's paw . MICHAEL looks down at them too . &nbsp; CORPORALVillage coming up , sir . At the door of the pub , McCARDLE and others . McCARDLE calls in excitedly : &nbsp; MCCARDLETom ! Tom ! ' E 's comin ' - But breaks off surprised , even scared , as the lorry pulls up exactly outside the pub door . RYAN , rushing out in a flurry of vulgar curiosity :  --  76  --  &nbsp; RYANLet 's have a look at ' im th- Stops , finding himself a few feet from RANDOLPH 's impressive profile . The group looks embarrassed and resentful , like sullen schoolboys . In the lorry , CORPORAL : &nbsp; CORPORALCome on lad , off you get ! But MICHAEL mouths and waves ahead . RYAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draw away with MICHAEL in the back . RANDOLPH 's aristocratic aloofness has rattled them . McCARDLE and FRIEND are first to recover . &nbsp; MCCARDLEWell - what does he think he is ? &nbsp; FRIENDGod Almighty by the look of ' im . He looks for approval to RYAN , but he is still staring after : The lorry recedes down the street , loiterers turning to look after it , and disappears . &nbsp; RYAN ( turning , grumpy and deflated ) Ah , they 're all the same . ( and goes in ) CHILDREN in the playground crowd the gates as the lorry draws up . They peer gravely at RANDOLPH , a genuine ogre . He looks at them but makes no attempt to placate or win them . MICHAEL shins out of the back of the lorry holding his flowers . He mouths some kind of gratitude and : &nbsp; CORPORALYou 're welcome lad ! He lets in clutch again and the lorry moves away . RANDOLPH looking out and back sees : Travelling , his POV , MICHAEL enters the playground among the children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the school  --  77  --  is lost behind the shoulder of hillock where a line of ROSY 's washing flies . RANDOLPH sits back and sees on the left : The limitless glittering expanse of ocean . As RANDOLPH 's head turns slowly , taking in this tranquil infinity he relaxes for the first time - just a little , taking off his cap and placing it neatly on his knee . CORPORAL registers this . Then : &nbsp; CORPORALCamp coming up sir . And as RANDOLPH straightens up , jettisons cigarette and replaces cap : &nbsp; CORPORAL'Ang on sir , Changes down , swings lorry sideways up a short steep track between whitewashed posts where SENTRY presents arms and SERGEANT salutes . Lorry lurches to a halt among the few desolate huts . Engine cuts . SHORT CLOSE SHOTS , SERIES . A private with a brush and of whitewash looks towards the lorry . So too the SERGEANT at the gate . And a MECHANIC , bent round from the open bonnet of another lorry . Their faces impassive , and ready to judge . Their POV , CORPORAL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same calculated economy of movement , looks round and sees : The little camp ; his men looking back at him . He turns hearing hasty footsteps , a stamping halt , to face : A fleshy CAPTAIN with a coarsely amiable face , wearing a rather rumpled trouser uniform , who tucks his swagger stick beneath one arm and salutes clumsily . &nbsp; CAPTAIN ( north-country ) Captain Smith , sir . Welcome to a fate worse than death . Inside the cheerless ablutions LANKY SOLDIER and COMPANION in coarse Army undervests can just see out of the lifted window . LANKY SOLDIER nudges companion excitedly :  --  78  --  &nbsp; LANKY SOLDIEREh - ! LONG SHOT their POV through the window slit . RANDOLPH following CAPTAIN towards a nissen hut with three chimneys .

CLERK , his fingers poised on the keys of the machine , looks with interest at the decoration . So does CAPTAIN . RANDOLPH has grown used to his reaction and elects not to notice . Takes from overcoat pocket the silver cigarette-case and offers one to CAPTAIN with a smile , distant but unexpectedly winning . &nbsp; CAPTAINOh , well , thanks ! And rummages for matches . RANDOLPH just turns one mild look in direction of CLERK and SOUND of typewriter hastily recommences . CAPTAIN drawing on his cigarette is agreeably impressed by its quality . Looks at it and grunts . &nbsp; CAPTAINMm . . . ( then brisk ) Well - This is our communication with the outside world - He moves a heap of papers to disclose on the table a field-telephone with a hand crank . Field-telephone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  He gives the crank a twirl and turns away to the wooden box files piled one on another . &nbsp; CAPTAINNow , records personnel , records , armoury , records stores - The telephone gives a metallic mutter .

CUT Section Details THE SOUND OF TYPEWRITER AND THE CAPTAIN 'S TOO-LOUD The sound of typewriter and the CAPTAIN 's too-loud , lively voice comes through partition to CORPORAL , who is unpacking RANDOLPH 's things on little bed in Officers ' quarters - a single bed-sit , basic furniture by Army , additional accretions by past occupants , magazines , pictures of Royalty and High Command . RANDOLPH 's case reveals a satin-lined interior from which CORPORAL , smoking a short pipe has taken with respect a beautiful ivory and silver pair of brushes , an ivory comb . Hanging up a Norfolk Jacket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a silver framed picture of a country house , horses and hounds in front of it .

Name of Ryan . &nbsp; RANDOLPHAn informer ? &nbsp; CAPTAINWell , he 's nothing to inform has he ? But - aye , the police slip him a fiver now and then you know . His tone is indulgent and apologetic but he does n't like the subject . Neither does RANDOLPH ; he makes a slight grimace . CAPTAIN at once : &nbsp; CAPTAINOh he 's all right . Big mouth , open hand , empty pocket . You know . He 's all right really . . .  --  81  --  But it makes a little silence , in which CAPTAIN 's eyes travel again to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the direction of his gaze .

He passes one finger lightly and rather shakily over his cheek bone , the first superfluous movement we have seen . On SOUND very faintly a military march , jaunty and lyrical . CAPTAIN on SOUND , OVER : &nbsp; CAPTAINSecond Battalion , South East Lancashires . They 're in Front Line . " Front Line " is said with real dread .

Excuse me - Goes quickly to the door and opens it . Desperately cheery : I 'll pop back to say good-bye .

Excitement spreads through the whole group . He is an object of curiosity to the YOUNG MEN , and from the reactions of the YOUNG WOMEN , ranging from confusion to MOUREEN 's bright-eyed stare , we gather that he is an object of sexual speculation too . Their whisperings die on : RANDOLPH 's approach . He limps past the impudently curious faces of the YOUNG MEN , his own face impassive . But ahead of him :  --  86  --  A GIRL curtseys mockingly and in a sarcastically humble tone : &nbsp; GIRLMorning sir . Welcome to Kirrary . RANDOLPH shoots a startled glance at her . He is hurt by the gratuitous hostility . But addresses himself to the station steps and goes up steadily , click and thump .

He decides on the camp and limps away in that direction . But hears on SOUND , softly , sing-song : &nbsp; MOUREEN ( sound ) Peg - leg . . . The phrase hits him . He turns on his uneven feet and looks at : MOUREEN and her COMPANION . She brazens it out . COMPANION gives her a half-hearted shrug .

RANDOLPH looks off ; we see him pulled , resist , decide in his own favour , move closely with him across the street , through a swinging door and into the gloom of the pub where we find : ROSY . In a white lace blouse now , but still " dressed up " . She looks up from the book she has been reading at one of the marble topped tables and sees : RANDOLPH . He takes off his cap , hears a guttural sound and looks to the side , seeing : MICHAEL , mopping and mowing from his niche , claiming friendship from the previous meeting . But RANDOLPH 's need is urgent , he click-thumps quickly to the bar and looks about . No one . He bangs the bell impatiently .

She adds it from a jug . &nbsp; RANDOLPHThank you . She returns to her place , and sits . She looks at her book . Half raises her head to look at the stranger . But checks the movement - perhaps he is looking at her . Looks back at the book but desperately attracted , stealthily looks again . Her POV the motionless ram-rod back at the bar . We examine him with her . He shifts and : She looks down quickly , blushing hard . She need not have bothered ; he is only lighting another cigarette .

RANDOLPH restlessly shifts his weight from one foot to the other . The bumping foot , closer , louder . On SOUND the jaunty military MUSIC begins again , softly . RANDOLPH commences a movement towards MICHAEL but checks it . The bumping foot , closer and louder yet . RANDOLPH takes a grip on himself ; a look of fear in his eyes . The bumping foot very close crashes against the wall . The MUSIC fully established now , not merely jaunty but ferociously cheerful , gay , conjuring up bright uniforms along Horse Guards Parade , as though sending men off to be crippled and shattered were a matter for joyful celebration .  --  90  --  RANDOLPH carefully grips the edge of the bar .

Too late ; RANDOLPH has passed the point of no return . He shakes violently . MICHAEL straightforwardly frightened , gets down and sidles away from the weird and possibly dangerous stranger . ROSY rises quickly and approaches puzzled , checks appalled at : RANDOLPH 's private hell . His eyes stare widly and his face is desperate with effort . Another moment of enforced rigidity . Then it comes again and shakes him vengefully . The MUSIC has a surge to it . MICHAEL , backing , growls . At the sound , RANDOLPH 's head flies round . He is horrified at being seen thus . He looks the other way and sees still worse - the young woman is hanging off , shocked . &nbsp; RANDOLPH ( weirdly sane from the physical chaos ) It 's all right . It wo n't last long . And at once is seized by another spasm . He looks round over his shoulder at : A little bentwood chair , safe and solid as Van Gogh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crashing against the bar . MICHAEL cries out inarticulately , backed hard against the door . ROSY shoves him through into the street and bolts it , turns to see :  --  91  --  RANDOLPH launches himself from the bar . But his legs will not obey him , the chair goes over . His crippled foot comes down among the spindles and : RANDOLPH falls , the drums of the MUSIC cannonading , into Grey mud and blackness . The drums now unmistakeably the pulverizing roar of a heavy bombardment . Desperately he drags himself into a trench shelter , one hand gripping a dimly-seen pit-prop . His eyes glow with horror , he fights against dry sobs , emitting sounds like the braying of a donkey , his human status gone , a crouched and crippled animal . Uncomprehendingly he sees a hand stretched out from the darkness and close upon his own . But as he stares , the guns recede , dying to silence . He looks from the hand to its owner . His POV , ROSY 's face looks back at him from a background @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long-blinded man might look at the first thing revealed to his sight by the removal of the bandages , with an intensity of tender interest . In profile , against darkness , they regard each other like once happy lovers suddenly and unexpectedly re-met . They move together and gently kiss . At which the pit-prop reveals itself for the leg of the table under which he has dragged himself , as natural light and sounds reassert themselves . A noise from the street half-recalls ROSY to time and place . She rises . But RANDOLPH rises into frame ; they are facing and close ; swept by an urgent need kiss passionately , exploring it , kissing again . The light through the window changes again , filling the room with sunlight as they kiss till ROSY pulling gently away but still helplessly looking at him and speaking as from a dream . &nbsp; ROSYI must open the door . . . He lets her go . She looks at him still , then goes hurriedly to the door - as two women pass chattering along the street - and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but his eyes do not leave her . She unbolts the door and opens it and : MICHAEL looks in at her .  --  92  --  She draws back and : MICHAEL enters warily , peers still warily at RANDOLPH seeming to test the atmosphere in some way , like a sharp-nosed animal . ROSY goes behind the bar where she seizes a glass and a cloth ; but her attention is still riveted on RANDOLPH 's half-turned back . With a pale attempt at normality they exchange such information as they can under the brooding eye of MICHAEL who now stands hesitantly by his accustomed seat . &nbsp; RANDOLPHIs this where you live ? &nbsp; ROSYI live at the schoolhouse . &nbsp; RANDOLPHSchoolhouse ? &nbsp; ROSYI 'm married to the teacher . &nbsp; RANDOLPH ( gently ) Oh . &nbsp; ROSY ( with sudden irritation ) Well are you stayin ' or not , Michael ? Hastily MICHAEL ascends to his seat , as two horsemen gallop past in the street , in Sunday best on shaggy ponies . Rather fearful and quick , as an approaching clatter is heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Through the window we glimpse RYAN , McCARDLE and FRIEND and OTHERS pull up on two flat carts . &nbsp; RANDOLPH ( quick and quiet ) I do n't know your name . &nbsp; ROSYShaughnessy . Rose Shaughnessy . That 's my dad .  --  93  --  &nbsp; RANDOLPHWhich ? &nbsp; ROSYThe big one . He owns this place . RANDOLPH says slowly , after a pause : &nbsp; RANDOLPHYour father is the publican ? &nbsp; ROSYYes ; why not ? RANDOLPH registers her evident ignorance of her father 's spare time occupation and turns to face the man himself , leading the noisy fair-goers into his domain , the worse for drink . He is dressed in a dreadful dashing outfit of check tweed , McCARDLE and FRIEND in sooty suits and carrying crates of panic stricken hens . YOUNGSTERS and OTHERS crowd in after them , boisterous . But RYAN checks , seeing RANDOLPH . Silence falls , unease communicating backwards so that those still pressing in crane curiously to see . RYAN has a moment of acute awkwardness then , remembering his audience , sternly : &nbsp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir . Not in your official function . Ah - but in yourself you 're welcome . RANDOLPH , sitting in dead silence winces hearing : &nbsp; RYAN ( announces ) A brave man is a brave man ! In any uniform - English Khaki , Irish Green - Aye - or German Grey . RANDOLPH looks at him and nods once in agreement : &nbsp; RYANAh - you 've a large mind , sir ! Put it there . ( he lurches forward , slopping Randolph 's drink ) Oh .  --  94  --  &nbsp; RYAN ( Cont ) ( then holding out a meaty hand ) Put it there . There is no help for it . RANDOLPH gives his hand . McCARDLE watches sourly . ROSY watches shamedly , hearing : &nbsp; RYANYou 've met my daughter , then ? &nbsp; RANDOLPHYes . A silence ; the VILLAGERS watching in bovine curiosity . RYAN uneasy . &nbsp; RYANWell come on everyone - the Major 's not a peep-show ! It has no effect ; ROSY makes an attempt at business behind the bar . Seeing the movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your old Dad 's got you this time - from the Fair ? Hmp . Guess . &nbsp; ROSYI do n't know , father . &nbsp; RYANWell come an ' look . Drags her from behind the bar and as RANDOLPH makes to go : &nbsp; RYANNo , no , do n't go , sir , you 'll appreciate this - you 've daughters of your own , I dare say . He is holding ROSY by the arm so that she is willy-nilly confronting RANDOLPH closely as he sits again saying : &nbsp; RANDOLPHNot daughters , no.  --  95  --  &nbsp; RYANThat , sir , is your misfortune . Come an ' look , Princess . . . He tows her away to the window , FRIEND leaning down to tell RANDOLPH confidentially : &nbsp; FRIENDHe 's a great giver , sir , is Tom . ROSY is held by RYAN before the farther window . With her we see : A free moving mare tethered behind his cart . &nbsp; ROSYOh . . . Father , you ca n't afford it .

RYAN 's eyes switch quickly towards RANDOLPH , watching intently . &nbsp; RYAN ( boisterous ) It 's a little Arab mare sir . &nbsp; A MAN ( looking through window ) She 's Connemara . &nbsp; RYAN ( tells Randolph with a jerk of the head ) Would n't know an Arab from an elephant .  --  96  --  &nbsp; THE MANI know a Connemara . Some amusement at RYAN 's expense . &nbsp; RYANAll right ! All right then - You look as though you 'd be a judge , sir . Perhaps you 'll favour us with . . . RANDOLPH walks to the window by ROSY .

Their glances meet for one moment and then he is gone , click-thump , in the silence , the length of the pub , people drawing back for him needlessly but by instinct . He leaves the silence behind him . McCARDLE with an uncertain little laugh . &nbsp; MCCARDLEWell then ? CLOSE SHOT . MOUREEN . &nbsp; MOUREENSnob . CLOSE SHOT . ROSY . RANDOLPH passes the window looking straight ahead as she hears the word taken up and agreed to , the village happy to have found a pigeon hole for the impressive overlord . " Snob . . .

She looks up at : Her POV CHARLES has entered from the street , looks round , sees her , and comes , smiling . He leans over the bar and she , after a barely perceptible pause , offers her cheek to his marital kiss .

RANDOLPH hears the distant whinnie above the loud " thump-thump-thump " of the dynamo . He lies in bed quite still , a silhouette in the darkness . We see the swimming moon through the opened window above his head . A movement . A cigarette glows red . Then the exhaled smoke passes across the face of the moon which : Shines down through the opened schoolhouse window too , where sleepless ROSY lies by sleeping CHARLES . She shifts restlessly as the distant " thump-thump-thump " is pierced by the nearby whinnying of the mare.  --  98  --  CLOSE SHOT a big black gelding grumbles uneasily and moves in his stall , thumping the stable door , rustling his bedding .

ROSY picks up the empty enamel bowl from the paddock wall and drifts back towards the dwelling ; her eyes are unseeing , her expression preoccupied , almost drugged . Tall , budded lily plants brush against her skirt waist-high , seem almost to impede her - she stops . CUT CLOSE SHOT . With a violent bang SOLDIER cranks the dynamo into violent life , its corrugated iron hutch vibrating as it settles to its night 's work . LONG SHOT . RANDOLPH sits motionless in the exact centre of his room at the remains of the meal laid there for him . " Thump-thump-thump " on SOUND .

Silence . RANDOLPH stirs , takes cigarette from case and begins to tap it . But the action becomes mechanical , his gaze abstracted . MUSIC " Wings " creeping in . He is looking at nothing . But suddenly his head moves back an inch and the motion ceases . He is staring fascinated and incredulous at : CLOSE UP ROSY as he saw her in the pub just before they kissed ; it lasts a flash and : CLOSE UP RANDOLPH at the same moment ; it lasts a flash and : CUT  --  99  --  MUSIC continues over : CLOSE SHOT ROSY stares at this second image with the same expression . But is roused by a sound and looks off at : CHARLES plumps a corrected exercise book on a pile and takes another . Elementary sums ; his practised eye and red pencil need only seconds for their work . MUSIC fades to silence on this . ROSY watches . " Thump-thump-thump " from the distance . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind . For one book he has a fond little smile at some infantile error . For another a little worried frown and a just audible " tut-tutting . " ROSY watches . The flutter and plump of the marked books goes on . She looks about her , but there is no answer to her dilemma in the too familiar little room . She gets up unobtrusively and goes out . CHARLES smiles , registering her going unconcernedly and goes back to his work . ROSY comes from the house to the garden as driven by demons ; night moths flutter from the plants as she passes , swiftly , her lips parted , frowning with pain , her eyes wide and full of desperation . She leans herself against the house end in the moonlight gasping , seeing : The white trumpets of tiger-lily , luminous in the dark , the low stone wall behind . Her head moves away from them restlessly . On SOUND the mare snorts , uneasily . She looks off . And goes rigid . RANDOLPH stands twenty yards from her , ghostlike in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stance and half concealed position , we feel that he has been there a long time . They confront each other thus , frozen for a space , like two night-prowling animals , suddenly met . RANDOLPH moves towards her , coming on steadily , looking straight at her . Both for this moment absolved from human doubt . ROSY looking straight at RANDOLPH moves a few unconscious steps towards him . It takes her into the midst of the lilies , the white flowers closing round her as she stops . The distant thudding of the dynamo . RANDOLPH has stopped , a few paces beyond the wall . He speaks low and clear . She answers in a whisper but at once .  --  100  --  &nbsp; RANDOLPHWill you meet me tomorrow ? &nbsp; ROSYHow ? The mare snorts again .

He looks up with a pleasant half-smile , looks down but up again and : &nbsp; CHARLESWhatever 's that , darlin ' ? She comes in brushing briskly at her skirt , stained by clouds of yellow pollen . With a little laugh , but a bit breathless : &nbsp; ROSYOh , it must be the lilies . She fetches up at the mantel and fiddles with something there . CHARLES looks up at her ; with friendly senior concern and taking off his spectacles , smiling .  --  101  --  &nbsp; CHARLESYou 're restless , Rosy . Now that she must lie she does it with a polish that takes our breath away , turning to him with a little half-surprised laugh as revealed to herself by his acumen . &nbsp; ROSYI think I am a bit .

Pulverized spume makes a faint bright haze over its hurtling surface .

The roar CUTS to SILENCE on : EXTREME LONG SHOT , the two tiny riders entering a great bay of open country , cut into a thick wood , sharply delineated by a broken paling fence which we can just make out . The arms of the wood enclose them on either side . CLOSE SHOT . They have reined in . Both looking ahead into : Their POV the silent interior of the wood , debarred to them by the derelict paling fence , the fringe of close-grown brambles . As they look , sunlight comes , revealing magically tree-trunks , bushes , fallen branches , weeds , all overgrown and tangled , receding in planes . It looks half inviting , half sinister , utterly secluded . ROSY turns her head , full-face towards RANDOLPH , openly . Their steady glances meet .

The mare 's hooves placed delicately on the soft green of the ride , moving forwards .

But : ROSY gently thrusts through , the leaves rustling and comes out into : The end of the ride , the heart of the wood . Big trees here not an air stirring . The light falls green through the high vault of leaves ,  --  104  --  upon trunks of dim silver . The ground is soft with centuries of leaf-mould . Here where the big trees have conquered there is no scrub , but areas of bracken , flowering weeds and grass grow wherever they can find sufficient light . ROSY lets go the reins , leaving the decision to the horse which walks forward an uncertain pace or two and stops . She hears behind her on SOUND the approach of RANDOLPH 's horse and his dismounting . ROSY dismounts and turns , standing against her horse as RANDOLPH comes up to her . Gently he kisses her . She sways towards him . On SOUND again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow the horse as it moves away to : A still , dark woodland pond , fronded with the rotting rags of last year 's reeds and the fresh green blades of this year 's growth .

Then stillness again and on SOUND the sleepy summer croon of doves , continuing over : RANDOLPH and ROSY stand face to face where the horses left them . They are in an area of bracken - last year 's big fronds a brown bed pierced by hundreds of curled green shoots . Behind them is a long dead tree trunk ; but a nursery of young saplings grows close .

On SOUND the plaintive mechanical " clink-clink-clink " of the settling blackbird . One by one RANDOLPH undoes the buttons of her blouse . She is motionless but her eyes are just a little frightened and her breath just a little rapid . When he parts the blouse and sees that she wears no under-garment he looks up at her and she looks back . He gives her the faintest of warmly serious smiles with the eyes only . He kisses her again and she presses herself against him , her arms about his neck . His hands draw the blouse from her skirt .

ROSY turns to him and begins to loosen his tie . The head of the black horse , cropping steadily . He blows . A squadron of dandelion parachutes takes off , hovers , drifts away on its mission . We TRACK , watching the casualties , the slow-motion near misses , follow the last survivor in a perilous dam-busting sweep across the surface of the pond to find its doom there at the eleventh hour . EXTREME CLOSE , it water-logs and sinks . RANDOLPH , his shirt opened now , draws the blouse from ROSY 's breast . She covers it quickly with her hand . He puts his hand on hers . She takes away her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breast , a long , slow kiss ; her eyes close ; she abandons herself to it . The sun , at a high angle , blazes down through a gap in the feathered branches , the leaves rendered transparent . UNDERCRANKED : the sunlight creeps up onto the end of the dead log , discovering unexpected veins of colour in the dark rotted wood . ROSY is excited now . Her nervous fingers knead among his hair . But RANDOLPH lays his head against her other breast and smiles softly as he hears on SOUND her heartbeat , remembering the very similar " thump-thump-thump " of the camp dynamo . His hand closes tightly on her other breast and ROSY makes a little SOUND and shifts . RANDOLPH kisses the soft flesh beneath his face and we sense his reaching down and drawing up her skirt .

FLASH SHOT , shooting upwards CLOSE ON ROSY from below , treetops behind her torso , hair all fallen , on her face a look of ecstasy . RANDOLPH 's arms come upwards into frame and pull her down towards camera , leaving a screenful of tree-tops and sky . Now she is on her back again and he above her ; her eyes are closed , her opened mouth is wet . The thudding heart-beat roars and accelerates sharply and her eyes flash open staring upwards sightlessly . SHOOTING straight upwards at the tree tops . On SOUND the now almost frantic drumming .

Barbed wire and picket posts , close , in monochrome light , grey like the mud in which lie still figures , some on their faces , some on their backs , all half submerged .

With a flash of flying silver and a fling of water , MICHAEL hauls a good sized trout from a fast running stream . He is under the arch of a small stone bridge , crouched on a flat rock , his right arm soaking to the shoulder . He is excited as when he caught the lobster , kills the flapping fish with efficient brutality and throws it to the bank , crooning merrily to himself . In the clear brown water , the panicked fish recover , drift to their accustomed feeding places , camouflaged . Then he steps to another stone and looking into the water with a bright and expert eye goes still as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose pink by the sunset . With incredible delicacy , muttering to himself , the misshapen man slides first his hand and then his whole arm down into the stream , feeling cautiously beneath a submerged rock . It brings his wooden face six inches from the sliding surface . His whole being is concentrated on it . But now his head turns . He has heard , before it is audible to us : The jingle and thud of the two horses approaching at the trot , then stopping on the bridge above him . Remaining as he is he just turns his head to stare vacantly at the shadows of ROSY and RANDOLPH cast by the low sun onto a length of stone retaining wall in the river bank , hearing :  --  108  --  &nbsp; RANDOLPH ( O.S. ) .

She has taken off the soiled blouse and has taken another from an open drawer . She holds it instinctively over her breasts at his appearance but smiles reassuringly : &nbsp; ROSYIt 's nothing at all .

She says it chiding , affectionately amused , concerned - the kiss of Judas . But she says it going to him in a rush and : CLOSE SHOT . ROSY , over his back . She stares through tears horrified at a future full of such treachery . They are closer at this moment than they have ever been before . CHARLES is remorseful , and against himself he can turn all the strength of his upright character .

It would be a forlorn place on a grey day , but now the air is full of light and bright with the voices of CHILDREN . They are scattered before us in constant darting motion , as they scavenge in the heavy tied-wrack for shells , strange bits of rubbish thrown from ships , sea-bright bits of glass and other valuable articles . The waves are high and curling , dumping their load . CHARLES , walking with a straggling group of his small charges , a privileged SMALL GIRL possessively holding his hand . He enjoys these Nature Walks at least as much as the CHILDREN . He is full of interest ; for them it is mainly escape from the schoolroom . SMALL BOY coming up with something in his hand asks rather lackadaisically : &nbsp; SMALL BOYWhat 's that , sir ? &nbsp; CHARLESWell it 's not the cuttle-fish what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a start . ( taking it ) Well now , that 's an insulator . Aye an insulator , that is.

Tim 's right . ( addressed the impromptu study group ) Now why is there so much stuff in Killins Bay ? &nbsp; SMALL BOYIt 's a tidal ( struggles ) - tidal eddy round the Head .  --  115  --  &nbsp; CHARLESA tidal eddy ! Good , Tim . SMALL BOY looks about at the others , pleased . SMALL GIRL glowers at him and puts out her tongue . &nbsp; CHARLESCome on , then - look about . He glances off and down and sees : His POV two pairs of footprints nearby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's ; the man 's right footprint has a scurr to it . CHARLES has n't registered . Finding SMALL GIRL still attached to him , shakes her off . &nbsp; CHARLESNo no , go on now . Reluctantly she follows the other CHILDREN . Watching her disconsolate small back , CHARLES walking on along the footprints , calls : You never know , you might find a diamond tiara ! She flashes him a grateful smile over her shoulder and goes happily . CHARLES looks down at the sand . The footprints slide towards him . He looks at them , at first idly , but with dawning apprehension . He stops . Looks at : The woman 's prints - a small foot , stepping quickly . The man 's - a man who drags one foot and wears neat boots . &nbsp; SMALL BOY ( on sound ) Sir - CHARLES stops and focuses on him . The CHILD offers him something . &nbsp; CHARLESAye , that 's a cuttle-fish . Good lad . &nbsp; SMALL BOY ( going , turns to say ) I 'll try and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( nods ) You do that , Tim . . . ( he looks down again at ) The footprints . CHARLES raises his head . There is no further doubt . It is them . He looks ahead at : The two sets of footsteps wandering away over the smooth sand . He hesitates , not liking the role of sleuth , but is helplessly drawn . He sets off to follow . Now he finds : The woman 's shoeprints are replaced by bare footprints , the place where she changed marked by irregular little disturbances . On SOUND CHILDREN approaching : " Sir , sir . . . " CHARLES stops again , looks down at the indignant little group . Their SPOKESMAN : &nbsp; SPOKESMANSir , Timmy Wheelan says that aluminium floats . &nbsp; CHARLESWell tell him he 's wrong .

ROSY and RANDOLPH 's footprints half obscured . CLOSE SHOT . CHARLES exactly as before but staring now : The churned-up sand is pristine , unnaturally white , the sky unnaturally bright , the surroundings simplified . On SOUND CHILDREN 'S VOICES  --  117  --  continued but now with MUSIC , soft and tender , the Beethoven : ROSY and RANDOLPH coming slowly . Their movements too are simplified and sure . They have an arm about each other , talking . ROSY laughs up into her lover 's face , but they make no sound . Their feet leave in the smooth sand the footprints seen already . Now they stop , ROSY leaning on RANDOLPH for familiar support while she takes her shoes off , hopping awkwardly . Then they come , she bare-footed now . CLOSE SHOT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tiny figures of the CHILDREN , the background actual . He is absorbing what he has just reconstructed . REVERSE SHOT . CHARLES full figured , his back towards us , contemplates the churned-up sand , the actual natural features . His head turns , looking down at : CLOSE SHOT the disturbance in the trodden sand by the pool 's brim . CHARLES sinks into frame and examines this thoughtfully . He looks off quickly : MUSIC and CHILDREN 'S VOICES continuing on SOUND . ROSY and RANDOLPH coming on across the pristine sand through their rarified surroundings . RANDOLPH veers towards the pool , where he has see something , coming almost straight towards : QUICK CLOSE SHOT , CHARLES staring - he too now inhabits their rarified world : THREE SHOT : MUSIC and CHILDREN 'S VOICES continuing over , CHARLES CLOSE in foreground looking at RANDOLPH , ROSY following as he comes to the pool 's brink and pulls something from the pristine sand . They ignore him ; he is not there for them . He watches helplessly , riveted , noting every moment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sand a clot of something . CHARLES watches him swill it in the pool , revealing a lovely sea-shell , rose-coloured , with frills and lutes of pearl . And again : THREE SHOT . CHARLES must watch as ROSY receives it lovingly , the MUSIC lyrical . CLOSE SHOT CHARLES , MUSIC over . FULL SHOT he stands by the pool alone with the footprints , the world natural again . He looks off in the direction of the angle in the rock face . Along his life too , and the last year of it . And at his own inadequacies in the face of this god-like rival . And remembers ROSY 's great expectations , now justly met , himself discarded . Justly . Yet it is insupportable . And bitterly sad . The MUSIC flies in the face of this ,  --  118  --  Olympian , the triumphant strings and brasses telling him " This is what we meant - this love of these two . We are not for you . " Haggard , he regards : The double line of footprints where it disappears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landscape well . He knows what lies in the further bay beyond the jutting angle of rock , towards which their footsteps lead and behind which they disappear . He starts to follow , torn between his need to know and his fear of knowing . He is drawn to a run , slows , runs again . And checks , at the angle of the rock , MUSIC cutting to shocking silence as he stares into the further bay and sees : The black mouth of a cave . The footsteps lead straight to it . We can not see if they lead out again , but : CLOSER SHOT of the same . No footprints lead out . He almost reels against the rock-face for support . On SOUND he hears : &nbsp; SMALL BOY ( on sound , small-voiced , anxious ) What is it , sir ? CHARLES stares down white-faced at : A little group of children staring up at him . SMALL GIRL scared .

CUT Section Details REPEAT SHOT REPEAT SHOT , the black mouth of the cave , as he saw it . But now the sea covers half of the sand , advances to within twenty feet of the cave 's entrance . Shooting out from inside the cave . The lovers ' footprints leading out and away . They have gone . But another set of footprints , not theirs , leads in . MUSIC " MICHAEL 'S DAY " a mournful honky-tonk . MICHAEL . He is crouched in the dark against the wall of the cave , his expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks , slowly , almost unwillingly at : The place where the lovers lay in the sand of the cave . There are no signs of frenzy ; it is simply where two people lay in one another 's arms . MUSIC , twangles on . MICHAEL . His hopeless gaze wanders from their place ; he searches as for a clue : PANNING his POV , the rock walls of the cave , the waves endlessly unfolding and flopping without . Closer now on the rising tide . MUSIC . MICHAEL is looking at their place again . Pain comes into his eyes . His head drops . He sees his own crippled foot , in the misshapen boot . He pulls it under him , out of sight . But now he sees , under his nose : RANDOLPH 's footprint with its scurr . MICHAEL looks up . He crawls towards their resting place . Gingerly , delicately , trying not to disturb it , he places his hand there where they lay . He waits for some communication from them , like a wireless operator with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes . His MUSIC sinks a little . His powers of concentration are exhausted for the moment . He gazes mindlessly towards : The waves as before . MICHAEL . The MUSIC sinks to something like a tinny cradle song , as he hesitates , then very carefully lies down on his side , with his knees drawn up , his hairy face pressed gently against the sand . He seems to be listening , with timid hope , for some message . None  --  120  --  comes . He stands shamedly , like a dog with its tail between its legs . But is arrested by : RANDOLPH 's scurred footprint . MICHAEL compares it with his own . The MUSIC rises hopefully . But the moment of genius passes . He blinks painfully , and prepares to sit again . His sharp eye focusses : Some small brilliant object in the sand is winking at him . MICHAEL stares at it cautiously . It glitters at him ; a definite invitation . Swiftly he scuffles forward and picks it up . He summons every brain cell to grapple with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One of RANDOLPH 's brass buttons , in MICHAEL 's hand . MICHAEL stares at it , breathing hard , beginning to mutter . Then with one last glance walks out of the cave , walking as we have not seen him walk before : with purpose .

CUT Section Details IN A CUP-SHAPED DELL AT THE TOP OF THE CLIFF In a cup-shaped dell at the top of the cliff , ROSY is plucking heather . The horses are beyond her , nibbling at the short dry grass . Her search for good spriggs takes her to the cliff edge . She glances down at the beach below and freezes . She has seen : LONG SHOT down , her POV , MICHAEL on the beach below coming from the direction of the cave . ROSY horrified , turns quickly to tell : RANDOLPH .

What has he seen ? And where is he going , with such uncharacteristic determination ? CUT Muttering feverishly to the accompaniment of honky-tonk , gay and certain , MICHAEL in his undervest is at work on something , bent over it and seated . Sewing . He is in the dim interior of the squalid and half-derelict cottage where he lives . One area of beauty shines on the deep sill of the unglazed window - coloured pebbles , feathers , softly glowing sea-shells . Beside him on the packing case which serves him for a table is an upturned jar from which has poured a worthless collection of discarded baubles - broken brooches , bits of ribbon , beads , a watch face , buttons . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wood on leather ball , footsteps running up and down . MICHAEL jumps up and puts on his waistcoat . He has sewn an uneven row of brass buttons , brass brooches , a brass cogwheel , down the front . Now he carefully lifts from the litter of shining rubbish on the table a decoration made from a discarded red suspender from a woman 's corset and a cross-shaped brooch of glass and filigree tin . Standing before a piece of flawed looking-glass he pins this carefully to his breast . He goes quite still , rapt and serious as some newly knighted squire at Camelot . But he must not miss his tryst . Hastily he completes the ceremonial preparations . He takes a handful of soiled confetti from the tin where he has kept it and sprinkles it carefully on his head and shoulders .

The alley behind him degenerates quickly to a track across over grassland . MICHAEL stares back sternly at : A group of YOUNG MEN grinning , leaning on their hurley-sticks.  --  122  --  &nbsp; MOUREENMichael , is it a wedding then ? MICHAEL steps forward a pace or two and throws her a curt salute . &nbsp; MOUREENIt 's the Major ! They come towards him , laughing delightedly , gathering round . MICHAEL frowns at this behaviour . However , officer and gentleman ; that he is , throws them another salute . They roar . McCARDLE calls back into the pub ( laughter on SOUND over ) . &nbsp; MCCARDLEHey Tom - Will you look at this ? MICHAEL limps about the circle of his gathering audience , distributing salutes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . But : CLOSE SHOT MICHAEL 's face . This is not funny . It is set hard .

RYAN , by McCARDLE at the pub door , shakes his head , smiling , and with hypocritical regret : &nbsp; RYANHe 's gettin ' worse you know . MOUREEN steps forward . &nbsp; MOUREENMichael - Michael - MICHAEL . Her voice penetrates . He comes to a jerky halt before her , puzzled . He does not seem to be getting the respect to which his new status entitles him . Expectant silence has fallen . &nbsp; MOUREENLet 's have a look at your VC - Laughter starts but checks . She has reached out for the decoration and MICHAEL has knocked her hand away . This is an unusual reaction .

Quietly : &nbsp; FATHER COLLINSAh Michael , you 're a perfect fool . You ask for trouble . ( coaxing but firm ) Come on now , take the foolish things off . He suits the action to the word , taking the decoration between fingers and thumb , to pull it off . But MICHAEL leaps back with a roar of anger , red lights dancing in his little eyes . And from his distance threatens the astonished priest .

FATHER COLLINS is hurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two YOUNG MEN make as though to seize the culprit . He leaps away and snatches from the gutter a bit of bent iron pipe .

FATHER COLLINS , to YOUNGSTERS at large : &nbsp; FATHER COLLINSWhat 's eatin ' him ? - ( more sharply ) What 've you bin doin ' ?  --  124  --  &nbsp; MOUREEN ( sincerely sharing his confusion ) Do n't know Father - We 've not done anythin ' . . . He sees that they are as puzzled as he , turns again to MICHAEL . Kind but firm , as one who will brook no further nonsense : &nbsp; FATHER COLLINSAll right now , Michael , what 're you up to ? MICHAEL is still tranced . But now he cocks his head like an alert dog which hears before anyone its master 's step . The anger dies away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They alley where MICHAEL lives . It hides whoever is coming but now we hear the rhythmical thudding of hooves , and ROSY appears on her mare , its hooves clattering as she pulls it to a trot on the cobbles of the street . She reins in , and looks straight at : MICHAEL steps forward , his eyes radiant ; he draws himself up as never before ; his arm sweeps up to a salute into which he tries to put all the inarticulable passions of his addled heart . He holds it . ROSY stares down at MICHAEL . She flushes . Looks sideways at : The YOUNGSTERS watch , intently and silent . They sense that MICHAEL 's performance has taken a different turn . And it has had a disproportionate effect on ROSY , which promises mischief of some kind . MICHAEL 's hand falls slowly , as though exhausted . There , he has told her . He waits calmly for his rewards . ROSY glances instinctively at : The priest , looking hard from MICHAEL to herself : On SOUND one voice , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She feels her guilt emanating from her like heat . Clicks softly to her horse as though confiding a secret . It walks on . But MICHAEL seizes the bridle staring up at her , eager for the reward .

MICHAEL still hanging on and looking up at her , anxious now and mumbling . Fresh whisperings and now some suppressed mirth on SOUND . The crowd is behind a pace or two now but ROSY can feel their eyes , can see the villagers at their doorways in the street before her . She is ready to weep . Fiercely and low : &nbsp; ROSYLet go . . . ! Michael , let go or I 'll whip you ! Still he hangs on . Absolute silence on SOUND . RYAN stares from the pub doorway . His mouth is open , but a dreadful apprehension gathers darkly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at ROSY , stricken . It is clear to him that something has misfired . What can it be ? He had covered every possible contingency . ROSY for the first time in her life has fellow-feeling for him . Or is she merely clever ? At any rate she stops the horse , leans forward , puts her hand on his which hold the bridle and gently pleads : &nbsp; ROSYMichael darlin ' ! Let go ? MICHAEL looks at her hand on his . He is quite happy . She had asked him for something . He can give it . He takes away his hand , and ROSY is off at a swift trot . He runs after her a pace or two then isolated , back towards us , draws into another salute after her fast receding figure . On SOUND whispering and giggling rises again . A YOUNG MAN puts his fingers in his mouth and emits a piercing whistle after her . Suddenly they are all whistling , the street possessed by the inhuman sound .

Looks back at McCARDLE who looks at the ground . RYAN slinks back into the pub like a beaten dog . Whistling OVER . FATHER COLLINS looks across at the pub with pity , then gloom and anger ; darts a heavy look at the excited YOUNGSTERS - they are beyond control ; he strides off down the street , purposeful . The YOUNGSTERS at his going can give free vent to their malignant excitement . MOUREEN swaggers up to MICHAEL , her friends following anticipatory . She piles up her hair , in caricature of ROSY , and in  --  126  --  the wheedling tones of a besotted sweetheart eyelids lowered , a salacious whisper : &nbsp; MOUREENOh Major darlin ' , let me touch your VC . . .

There is n't . &nbsp; FATHER COLLINSSay it then . &nbsp; ROSY ( exasperated , voice shaking ) There 's nothing between me and Major Doryan !  --  128  --  &nbsp; FATHER COLLINSLook at me , Rosy . She whips round and glares at him , her expression like her voice , hard and glittering with desperate deceit . The priest sucks in his breath and : &nbsp; FATHER COLLINSOh child , what a face . . .

ROSY looks scared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FATHER COLLINSRose - tell me now - ! &nbsp; ROSYWhat ? &nbsp; FATHER COLLINSYou 'll have to tell in the Confessional , you little fool - &nbsp; ROSYI do n't " have to " come - ( it takes her own breath away ) - to the Confessional ! &nbsp; FATHER COLLINS ( appalled ) . . . Child . . . ! ROSY looks at him in a different way , wistful and proud . &nbsp; ROSYChild ? She seems to consider it , then looks back at him and shakes her head . They remain looking at one another as on SOUND we hear the CHILDREN clattering into the classroom . CHARLES opens the communicating door . His anxious eyes in which the shock still has not died , fall straight on ROSY . He can read nothing in her face but now senses the atmosphere , looks to FATHER COLLINS and quietly : &nbsp; CHARLESFather ? . . . The priest must clear his throat before , awkwardly hearty :  --  129  --  &nbsp; FATHER COLLINSAh ! Hello then . . . ! CHARLES looks back to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him , palely . He scrutinizes her ; surely she must bear a mark of some kind ? But there is nothing .

( waves his hand and smiles vaguely ) &nbsp; CHARLESWill you take the prayer then Father ? &nbsp; FATHER COLLINSAh - ! Gladly escapes into the schoolroom where we hear the CHILDREN greet him and fall to silence . CHARLES moves from the doorway to let him pass and still looks at ROSY . Could it be that he is wrong ? He gives her a half-smile curiously compounded of anxiety and reassurance , before following the priest . But ROSY is alerted . She looks at the communicating door hard and thoughtfully . Then her head jerks fractionally as she hears from the schoolroom a short Latin prayer , the CHILDREN whisking through it with expert mechanical reverence , eager to be off , the priest 's deep voice attempting unsuccessfully to hold them back . ROSY 's gaze wanders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaze alights on the heavy tangle of tack her eyes flash suddenly with fear and she moves swiftly to take something from among it . In the schoolroom , FATHER COLLINS murmurs a brief Latin Blessing and says : &nbsp; FATHER COLLINSAll right , off home with you . He turns immediately and looks at CHARLES . ( We hear the CHILDREN clatter out in silence , breaking into yells as they gain the playground ) . But CHARLES looks back at him quite blandly and says , dismissive .  --  130  --  &nbsp; CHARLESThanks . Good-day , Father . &nbsp; FATHER COLLINS ( cheerful ) Glad to help , Charles . - Is there , er , anythin ' else I can help you with ? A beat , then CHARLES , looking blank : &nbsp; CHARLESNo , I do n't think so . The PRIEST looks uncertain . &nbsp; FATHER COLLINSAh , well ; I 'll be off home too then . He tramps off after the CHILDREN with a face of foreboding . CHARLES just makes sure he is really going then turns and makes urgently for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly from the bedroom ; too quickly - she has the air of someone who has been up to something . But she smiles pleasantly enough at CHARLES and says pleasantly enough , albeit a bit breathlessly : &nbsp; ROSYYou 're late . &nbsp; CHARLESI took ' em for a Nature Walk . He is looking at her ; uncertainly but unwaveringly . She turns away on some invented domestic business . Carefully indifferent : &nbsp; ROSYUp Howarth ? &nbsp; CHARLESNo ; along the shore . A beat ; then collects herself and , hair-raisingly , produces a pleased reminiscent smile : &nbsp; ROSYFor cuttle-fish ?  --  131  --  &nbsp; CHARLESAye . &nbsp; ROSYIf you 'd come up Howarth we might have seen you . Hope takes root in CHARLES ' too-ready heart . &nbsp; CHARLESWhy - ! . . . Did you go to Howarth ? &nbsp; ROSY ( as mildly surprised by his questioning such an ordinary circumstance ) Yes , got some heather . She indicates this irrefutable evidence with a nod of the head . CHARLES looks at the mop of wiry little flowers on the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caresses them as though they were the head of a lost child . Blinking : &nbsp; CHARLESSo you did . . . ( he raises his face , he could almost giggle ) You - you 've not been to the beach then ? &nbsp; ROSYNo . . . ? Her tone is " puzzled " again . Now it is he who feels in danger - of revealing his unworthy fears . Cheerful , and still helplessly smiling : &nbsp; CHARLESAye well , it 's nice up Howarth . &nbsp; ROSYOh it 's grand . And lifting the tack goes outside through the kitchen into the garden where the lilies are dying , loathing herself . In the corrugated iron outhouse she heaves the tack onto a wooden trestle and remains as she is ; motionless , her gaze miserable , fixed on nothing . . .  --  132  --  CHARLES takes his fond gaze from the heather to the table cloth before him . His expression changes . He has seen : EXTREME CLOSE SHOT . Sand on the table-cloth . CHARLES ' hand comes into frame and brushes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stricken . Looks towards bedroom , hesitates , and goes . In the bedroom , with frantic speed , like a burglar , he flips open a wooden box of cheap beads on the dressing-table . Nothing . Shuts it . A round raffia basket with a lid . Nothing . Opens and rifles through a drawer of the dressing-table . Pauses . His hand has felt what he is looking for among the female garments there . He draws it out . CLOSE SHOT . The sea-shell in his hands . It is not so fine as the one he imagined , but fine enough . A few grains of sand in its softly shining , flesh-tinted interior . CLOSE SHOT . CHARLES is gripped in the deadly sadness of the over-gentle . Slowly he replaces the shell , almost tenderly he covers it again with the garments , gently reshuts the drawer , covering the traces of the crime against himself . He looks round . " Of course , " he feels . " Of course . . . " He walks slowly and sadly through the living-room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his familiar place of safety , enters : LONG SHOT the silent empty schoolroom . He wanders to the centre of it and stands . . . CLOSE SHOT . His absent downwards gaze is set in hopeless sadness . Now he raises eyes in which resignation clouds sharp pain .

Over this , on SOUND : &nbsp; ROSY ( sound ) Charles . . . ?  --  133  --  CHARLES registers with an effort that she has come through the house and is standing now in the doorway , regarding him , anxious and a little fearful . He looks back at the wife , young woman , erstwhile pupil .

ROSY , puzzled : &nbsp; ROSYWell . . . ? He takes a deep breath , he looks her up and down with detatched concern . &nbsp; CHARLESYou 'd better get them things off , darlin ' . He turns away and begins to gather up the exercise books from the line of little desks . Still she ca n't get away from the sight of his patient back . He pauses , half-turns and : &nbsp; CHARLESWhat are you waitin ' for ? She goes , troubled and uncertain . CLOSE SHOT , CHARLES stares after her . CUT pp. 98-113 &nbsp; pp. 134-153 THE MINE-SHAFT The mine-shaft .

A comrade , similarly dressed hangs on to the POLICEMAN 's belt to prevent his falling . The other planking has already been wrenched back , the planks lying petalwise away from the black aperture . A SERGEANT stands by , holding in one hand a big triple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other .

Two uniformed and two plain clothes POLICE-OFFICERS watch and wait with patient faces : a local INSPECTOR and DETECTIVE , another DETECTIVE , better-dressed , standing by . Two local uniformed POLICEMEN have been posted at a distance on the cart-track to keep away the curious . An operation of some importance evidently . On SOUND a sudden grating noise . The squeaking and groaning of winch and pulley cease . POLICEMAN at shaft head leans out and joggles the taut wire rope ; a twang , it swings free ; squeak and groan and the object emerges . The tinker 's cart , caught by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with mud now and one of its shafts was snapped off in its fall . The two POLICEMEN drag it aside and dump it . INSPECTOR and senior DETECTIVE approach , INSPECTOR pulling off one glove , finger by finger . He rubs some of the mud from the cart ; it reveals red paint . The two men exchange grimly satisfied glances . The INSPECTOR looks off , nods and : &nbsp; INSPECTORContinue . The SERGEANT casts his grapnel down the shaft , the coil of cord flying free . We hear the soft plunge as it lands . CUT LONG SHOT the village street , a bleak morning . The distant figure of ROSY coming towards us from the direction of the school . She is on the far side of the street ; and we PAN with her , entering the pub . FOUR MEN look up from playing cards as she enters , glance at one another then all stare at ROSY , openly amused . The FIRST turns in his seat and leans an arm on his chairback , the better to relish her . ROSY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence , then asks the first . &nbsp; ROSYIs me dad here ? &nbsp; FIRST MANNo darlin ' . He 's at Loothe , seein ' after a pig . His eyes flash messages of licensed amusement during the harmless speech . ROSY looks at him resentfully .  --  135  --  &nbsp; ROSYWill you tell him I was here ? &nbsp; FIRST MANI 'll do that - ( she is going ) - How 's your husband ? &nbsp; ROSY ( stops at the door ) He 's fine . &nbsp; SECOND MAN ( to third ) He 's a strong stomach then . &nbsp; ROSYWhat was that , Mr Keane ? &nbsp; SECOND MAN ( innocently ) I was just sayin ' to Joe here that your husband 's a fine lusty feller . ROSY looks at them all contemptuously ; but it has no effect on their sly , insulting complicit grins ; she is fair game now . She goes hearing their laughter . Thoughtful and a bit a afraid ROSY crosses the street and enters the dim and dingy little village shop , with its elementary staple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for gossip on chairs provided for that purpose . WOMAN STOREKEEPER is totting up an account for a frail YOUNG MOTHER , already careworn , carrying a vast , unclean baby . &nbsp; STOREKEEPERThat 's the flour , the jam , the - She breaks off as ROSY enters . The WOMEN regard her openly as the men did , but with faces of stone and no amusement . YOUNG MOTHER stares at her almost scared . ROSY takes in the atmosphere , smiles palely at YOUNG MOTHER : &nbsp; ROSYMaggie - But her erstwhile schoolmate dare not respond , darts a scared look at STOREKEEPER and draws away a little .  --  136  --  &nbsp; STOREKEEPERThe jam and the soap .

STOREKEEPER turns with insolent leisure and regards it . &nbsp; STOREKEEPEROh , aye , them . ( turns back to Rosy ) Them 's gone . I 've no potatoes . &nbsp; ROSY ( quietly ) Oh , I see .  --  137  --  And goes , but in the doorway with her back towards us is arrested by STOREKEEPER 's voice , addressing WOMEN deliberately loud and clear for ROSY 's benefit : &nbsp; STOREKEEPER ( sound ) The way I see it , Mrs Kenyon , there 's loose women and there 's whores . An ' then there 's British Soldier 's whores . On ROSY 's frozen back the heart-beat commences on SOUND . The tempo increases over : The faces of the WOMEN and STOREKEEPER , fixed in malignant condemnation , looking at : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SHOT ROSY ON HER BACK Heart-beat rises to its climax over CLOSE SHOT ROSY on her back , her arms about RANDOLPH 's neck in the climax of love . They are in the woodland clearing and : Shooting straight up we see that the motionless trees are Autumnal now , red and gold with the sun behind them . Heart-beat checks , subsides , thumps once ; again ; then silence , save for the murmur of insects . The sunlight falls on the giant log . Undercranked , it creeps over the figured surface , from detail to detail . The lovers lie in tired contentment . Now they see : Their POV , a butterfly wavers through the still air above them . They crane back their heads , looking up at : The butterfly , their POV looking magical , alighted on the ponderous curve of the log . They smile . Cautiously RANDOLPH rises to his knees . ROSY sits up and watches with sleepy pleasure as : RANDOLPH smiling slightly , stalks the butterfly . His lips still smile but he does it as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face with interest ; strange man , her lover . RANDLOPH 's hand is stretched out , ready for the pounce . His expression is intent . ROSY looks from him to the butterfly , back to him , a shade fearful .  --  138  --  RANDOLPH 's hand approaches , half-cupped , his dark eyes sharply focussed . FLASH SHOT ROSY , lips half open , alarmed . FLASH SHOT RANDOLPH 's fine hard face , the moment of striking . FLASH SHOT ROSY . She says quickly : &nbsp; ROSYDo n't hurt it - ! RANDOLPH freezes . His hand sinks and he turns to look at her . His expression is shocked and resentful . He stares at her a beat and then quietly but with passionate indignation : &nbsp; RANDOLPHWhy - should you think I was going to hurt it ? The trivial incident has opened a chasm between them . ROSY stares at him , appalled . But : RANDOLPH stares back unforgiving . The butterfly takes off and wavers up and away . TWO SHOT RANDOLPH and ROSY stare at one another across a widening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! RANDOLPH makes a sound between a sigh of relief and a groan , goes and gathers her into a kiss ; and they go down , ROSY wailing softly : &nbsp; ROSYI lo- His mouth comes down on hers . They are lying as before , she with her face upturned , eyes closed . But on sound - breathing and creaking . Shooting straight up ; the redgold trees against the perfect blue . A disturbance up there ; they move , resist , give in and lean , creaking , to the passing wind . CUT LONG SHOT down on the cove . Three curraghs are being borne upside down on the heads of six men , away from the sparkling sea .  --  139  --  The first is dumped above the highest tide-line by MICHAEL and FATHER COLLINS . They tilt back their heads and look up at : A front of mare 's tail clouds . High up , angelically white against the blue , they stream miles long from the horizon , cosmic portents made of ice by unseen winds of unguessable force . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up fast , Father . &nbsp; FATHER COLLINS ( half smiles ) Aye . Will you look at them things - UNDERCRANKED and TELESCOPIC . The miles high white processions advancing . On SOUND rueful , whimsically amused at God 's odd sense of humour : &nbsp; FATHER COLLINSYou 'd think they was announcin ' the coming of Christ . VILLAGERS look at him ; a deep one , their priest . A catspaw of wind . &nbsp; FATHER COLLINS ( brisk ) Well . Come on , Mike . They shoulder the crude , sun-bleached oars and go , wind sighing on SOUND . CUT Black night , the wind bellows like a beast , the big waves swing like hills of liquid coal . Something bears down upon us from the darkness - the bow wave , prow and high tarred sides of an off-shore fishing vessel , its heavy engine thudding slowly . Slung outboard from the gantry something roughly like a huge church bell . A sharp phrase in German comes down the wind , the object drops , almost on top of us , plunges into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Voice cries again ; the heavy engine accelerates and : The propeller churns under the vessel 's stern , driving her away from us so that we can see her name across the rounded transom : " The Rose of Erin " . Another command is called in German and we hear the tempo of her engine rise again over :  --  140  --  A life-raft swimming down a wave . Lashed onto it , coffin-like cases and boxes . The raft checks ; moored . Riding the waves beyond it we see others . We hear the beat of the boat , receding , leaving them behind . . . Shooting over the upturned curraghs towards the sea , we can see nothing of this , but hear through the wind and waves the trawler beating hastily away to safety . She has gone . Nothing happens . Then we hear the nearby growl of an engine in low gear and : The MATE looks out and down from the cab of a big lorry ; satisfied to see : Its rear wheels leave the hardway and grip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lee of the cliff and stops . MATE jumps quickly from the cab , his face stiff with suppressed anxiety . He runs towards the sea , stops by the curraghs and looks at as one who fears the worst and : The faces of the MEN who join him tell us that his fears are confirmed . Tough-looking characters in seamen 's jerseys , they glance at one another and say nothing ; DRIVER looks towards the MATE . He turns to the ACTIVIST at his side and shouts into the wind : &nbsp; MATEWell ? &nbsp; ACTIVIST ( shrugs his heavy shoulders then : ) We can try , Tim ! MATE nods and goes . ACTIVIST and MEN turn to the curraghs . They turn one over . Tucked in the shelter of the lorry 's covered rear sits an elderly man with a scholar 's face , wearing city clothes ; an incongruous figure among the ropes and rifles , a POLITICAL . He watches , troubled as MATE jumps in and begins dragging oars from under the coils of rope . He hesitates , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affords an opportunity to speak . Primly , reprovingly : &nbsp; POLITICALIt 's a contingency which might have been foreseen , I think .  --  141  --  &nbsp; MATE ( pauses and looks round ) Thanks . Very useful observation . &nbsp; POLITICALI 'm merely observing - &nbsp; MATE- I know exactly what you 're doing , Mr O'Keefe . You 're putting yourself right with the Committee , in case we ca n't do it . He goes to the back of the lorry with an armful of oars . Well , we 're goin ' to do it ! CUT Two MEN , thigh-deep in the black water , rush the curragh out towards the advancing waves . Arm deep they can do no more ; it is up to the four ROWERS . The two MEN stare after them , desperately anxious to know how they will fare . The curragh negotiates one foam-capped wave , disappears into its black trough and appears again , climbing the concave surface of a giant Atlantic roller . Its crest curls , grips the curragh , turns it over and hurls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past the two MEN . They flounder to where boat and ROWERS lie in shallow seething water . All soaked , breathless , shocked with the realization of defeat . &nbsp; MATE ( shouting ) Where 's Sian ? . . . Where the hell is Sian ? ( his voice cracks ; he shouts ) Sian . . . ! &nbsp; ACTIVISTHere , Tim ! The ACTIVIST is standing thigh-deep , his arm awkwardly twisted , face white . They flounder to him .  --  142  --  &nbsp; MATEAre you all right , boy ? &nbsp; ACTIVISTNever mind that , Commander . What in hell are we going to do ? CUT In the pub , McCARDLE and OTHERS , some with eyes closed , all with great feeling , sing . The storm booms outside , a loose sheet of iron clanking somewhere . The pub windows shake and thump in their loose frames . &nbsp; CHORUS " . . . Oh , no t'was the tre-ewth from her eyes ever shining - " RYAN stands by the door which shudders to the impact of the wind , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . &nbsp; CHORUS " - that made me love Mary , the Rose of Tralee . " &nbsp; RYANAll right now , that 's it . He wrenches open the door and the gale rushes in , making curtains fly , fire belch smoke , the room suddenly uncomfortable . Hurriedly they duck out into the storm , RYAN fighting the door shut after them . Outside in the black street , they disappear , leaning into the wind , holding their caps on . Inside , RYAN bolts the door top and bottom , turns down the oil lamp so that the only illumination comes from the open door to the living quarters behind the bar and , yawning and scratching luxuriously , makes his way towards bed . &nbsp; RYAN ( through his yawn ) Oh no t'was the truth from her - He stops dead , frozen , mouth agape , hands clutched to his shirt , seeing : The drenched and dripping figure of the MATE regarding him from the corridor leading from the bar to bedrooms and backdoor . The MATE has decided exactly what line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendly :  --  143  --  &nbsp; MATEHello , Tom . &nbsp; RYANWho . . . ? ( recognizes the Tinker ) You !

RYAN looks towards his photograph back to his visitor , speechless , incredulous of the realization . &nbsp; MATE ( with a friendly nod ) Tim Leary . He holds out his hand . RYAN steps into the corridor as in a dream , staring at him and takes it . Whereupon with his other hand MATE reaches behind RYAN and shuts the bar door . Before he knows what is happening , MATE is making down corridor to rear door . RYAN gapes afresh as MATE throws it open , the wind dashes in , setting the oil-lamp swinging and : MATE 'S MEN and POLITICAL enter , unfamiliar , soaking wet ; worst of all , with rifles . MATE has come straight back . &nbsp; MATENow what d' you usually do at this time , Tom ? &nbsp; RYAN ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . &nbsp; MATERight lads , we 'll go up .

RYAN 's appalled glare falls from the strange procession mounting his stairs , to the MATE . &nbsp; RYAN ( desperate effort to rise to the occasion ) But - Commander , sir - what 's happening ? CUT Section Details NIGHT Night . One of the rafts with the sinister long boxes on it , slides down the surface of a coal-black wave and then ascends . The climb is dizzying . At its height , the raft is checked by its mooring rope with a jarring thud like a drum-stroke . We glimpse a chaos of water and another raft before descending again . The wind has the steady note of an organ . CUT In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blanket covers the juddering window , stirring in the draught . The rifles are heaped on the bed . RYAN , recovering poise now : &nbsp; RYANGuns is it ? &nbsp; MATEThat 's right , Tom . Guns , dynamite , all the stuff the Movement needs . An explosion of wind . A slate slides down the roof above them , RYAN 's abstracted gaze follows its progess . We hear it smash in the yard below . &nbsp; RYANWell . . .

Tom , if it 's to be done in daylight it 's to be done quick . So we shall need some fellers . Say a dozen . Good strong fellers . And that 's where you come in . RYAN is appalled ; he is not only to harbour the criminals but share in the crime . A glimmer of hope : &nbsp; RYAN- But what if it does n't bust away ? &nbsp; POLITICALExactly . MATE 's lips tighten at the further interjection , but earnestly to RYAN : &nbsp; MATEThen we 'll wait one hour and go without it . One hour , Tom and twelve strong fellers . That 's all I 'm asking . Can you do it ? Everyone is looking at RYAN , waiting . &nbsp; RYANI could rout out a dozen , yes . MATE relaxes .

CUT The raft ascends to the top of a wave and jerks . Descends , ascends and jerks again . Somewhere below the mooring parts . The raft glides away , but is checked in a different way - by the rope which we now see linking it to the second raft . This second raft ascends a wave and jerks . But now it is subjected to the additional sideways pull of the first , which is adrift and straining at the linking rope . The jerk is louder and more jarring . CUT CLOSE UP . RYAN paralyzed surveys his best bedroom . Three MEN sleep on the bed , head to tail . Two MEN sleep in chairs . Glasses , bottles , cigarette ends , plates with the remains of food . POLITICAL watches RYAN . MATE rouses , rubs his face , smiles at him , consults @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wake the others , goes and peeps through the blanket curtain . One of the MEN in chairs has opened his eyes and is watching his leader , MATE , coming from window , purposefully : &nbsp; MATERight , Paddy , we 're moving . Go with Tom and take the Constable his breakfast . RYAN manages a glassy smile , watching MATE quietly put a huge revolver into the man 's hand . CUT  --  147  --  In the rushing darkness of the street RYAN pulls the handle of the police-station 's jangling door bell . Stands back and looks up towards the upper windows , then at : PADDY flattened against the wall , a shadow against shadow save for the glint of the gun . Somewhere down the street a chimney pot falls with a clatter and a crash . RYAN steps forward to ring again but hears a window drawn up above . CONSTABLE in pyjamas looks down between the flying curtains , face screwed irritably against the wind . RYAN shows himself , looking up . &nbsp; RYANIt 's me , Constable ! Ryan ! &nbsp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards the back of the station and hurriedly shuts window . PADDY motions RYAN with his head to lead the way . CONSTABLE approaches his back door . &nbsp; CONSTABLEJesus and Mary , what a life . . . He opens the back door . PADDY confronts him with the revolver and says in a voice full of hatred : &nbsp; PADDYNow do not make one sound - Constable . CONSTABLE enters office , roughly propelled by PADDY . RYAN following . &nbsp; PADDYRight . You , fat-guts . Handcuffs . RYAN reaches them down from where they hang . PADDY winks at him behind the CONSTABLE . &nbsp; RYAN ( stammering ) I 'm actin ' under duress , Constable , you can see th -  --  148  --  &nbsp; PADDYShut up . Put them on him .

PADDY puts down the gun and gags CONSTABLE with a rag from his pocket . He does it with deliberate savagery . In PADDY 's book , human beings and the Royal Irish Constabulary are two separate species . CUT They emerge from the police-station rear door again , closing it behind them . CONSTABLE and PADDY walk into a hanging wire , just blown down . RYAN looks at him tensely , but PADDY with his mind on his captive merely brushes it away and forces CONSTABLE on towards the yard entrance . But : Pausing to cross the black street back to the pub , PADDY has a moment of realization . Rams gun into CONSTABLE hard . &nbsp; PADDYWas that a telephone wire ? CONSTABLE turns and nods dumbly . PADDY turns him about again . Behind his back he gives RYAN a big clasp-knife , jerks his head towards the station rear . Then giving CONSTABLE a shove : &nbsp; PADDYMove .

He has been in corners tight as this before and knows the value of these last moments in which to think . His eye falls on : The wing mirror . In it a section of the villagers . Priest . Women .

RANDOLPH looks at the rifle , throws it clumsily and hastily from him as something unclean . The bewildered SERGEANT looking up at him just manages to catch it .

As they stare , the curious VILLAGERS standing round become insubstantial as faded photographs , almost not there , while he and she are lit almost harshly , abnormally present for one another . But this is a private world and : A sharp high laugh from MOUREEN restores actuality . The two are unaware of it , but VILLAGERS are beginning to mutter , scowling at the flagrant demonstration . CHARLES pushes through , takes his wife by the arm and pulls her unresistingly away . And suddenly the VILLAGERS are cat-calling and jeering after them . SERGEANT pushes roughly through to RANDOLPH who has turned now and is leaning against the cab with both hands . &nbsp; SERGEANTAll right , sir ?  --  163  --  &nbsp; RANDOLPH ( nods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; SERGEANTYes sir .

MEDIUM LONG SHOT , he crosses the cove away from us , approaching CHARLES . LONG SHOT the tiny figure of RANDOLPH , limping aimlessly away from us ; his men have gone . FATHER COLLINS stops a few paces from CHARLES . &nbsp; FATHER COLLINSHello Charles . He uses a quiet voice , soothing . However CHARLES turns up a face , tired and unshaven certainly , but perfectly composed and says sensibly : &nbsp; CHARLESHello there , Father . And looks down again . The priest is uneasy . He sits . Still gentle : &nbsp; FATHER COLLINSI 've brought your clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get back . &nbsp; FATHER COLLINSAnd something to drink . &nbsp; CHARLESOh . Thanks . He drinks greedily . Offers bottle politely to priest . &nbsp; FATHER COLLINSAye , I will . He too drinks , then , wiping his mouth , cheerful , relieved : &nbsp; FATHER COLLINSWell ! You seem all right man ! But CHARLES responds to his cheer no more than to his sympathy . Calm and detached .  --  179  --  &nbsp; CHARLESAye , more or less . I 'll get dressed now . As CHARLES takes clothes from frame and FATHER COLLINS looks after him , not quite liking CHARLES ' authoritative , quietly take-it-or-leave-it manner , honky tonk recommences and : CLOSE SHOT MICHAEL , he ships oars , looking off at : His POV gliding forward with the curragh , our progress brings into view round an angle of rock the distant figures of the seated priest and the standing schoolmaster , dressing . BIG CLOSE SHOT MICHAEL , entranced by the strange sight . CLOSE SHOT FATHER COLLINS looking up at CHARLES who seems gravely absorbed in his dressing . Now he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sea and observes : &nbsp; CHARLESMichael . . . ( then struck by a thought ) Oh - there was some nasty looking stuff back there yesterday . &nbsp; FATHER COLLINSThe soldiers have shifted it . &nbsp; CHARLES ( flatly . " Soldiers " connote Randolph ) The soldiers . &nbsp; FATHER COLLINS ( delicately reassuring ) Yes - I think they 've gone now . &nbsp; CHARLES ( brief silence , then a flat dismissive grunt ) . . . Mp . . . He goes on with his laces . The PRIEST , cautiously and amicably : &nbsp; FATHER COLLINSSo what have you been doin ' down here , Charles ? CHARLES considers his answer and says not loosely but specifically :  --  180  --  &nbsp; CHARLESOh . . . Thinking . The PRIEST is more and more uneasy . Delicately , almost hopefully : &nbsp; FATHER COLLINS'Bout Rosy ? CHARLES ' face stiffens fractionally . And there is a pause , in which he continues to work on his Iaces before , flatly and truthfully : &nbsp; CHARLESMyself mostly . . . Thanks for my clothes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And rolling up his nightshirt , rises . CLOSE SHOT MICHAEL watches : His POV CHARLES and FATHER COLLINS going , CHARLES leading , not too fast , considerate of the older man 's fatigue . The high mid-day sun . The veil of clouds withdrawing from it . CLOSE SHOT RANDOLPH . He is standing on the cliff-top looking down at something . His gaze is unwavering and deeply interested , but cool , seeing : LONG SHOT down , his POV , the PRIEST and the HUSBAND going back along the beach towards the village . The shadow of the receding cloud going before them . LONG SHOT , RANDOLPH in foreground looking down at the distant pair . A beat , and then he slowly turns and walks away in the opposite direction . MICHAEL in his curragh crawls onto the empty frame like a water beetle , following the pair . CUT LONG SHOT in the empty schoolroom , ROSY waits . She is seated on one of the desks with her feet on the seat , motionless . But now , as once before , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before sees : CHARLES , across the playground . He is listening , courteously but unresponsively to FATHER COLLINS . Now he leaves him , and the PRIEST with one glance after him , goes .  --  181  --  Crossing the playground CHARLES hesitates . His thoughts are in order , but it is not going to be easy . He elects for the longer entrance via the schoolroom . When he enters and sees ROSY he stops . ROSY looks back at him . CHARLES had not been prepared for her white strained face and hollow eyes , her air of shame . And neither he nor we have seen her thus before : waiting on somebody else . He shuts the door , giving himself time , then looks at her again . ROSY looks away . Then hearing his footsteps start and stop on SOUND looks up . He has moved to the side of the room a few paces , stands fiddling with something there , his eyes on it . Then he looks up at her and comes on . ROSY waits . It is for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Simply to break the silence : &nbsp; CHARLESThe children have n't come to-day then ? &nbsp; ROSYNo . Communication is established . Now he looks at her quite calm and straight . He has touched bed-rock and is at his best , ineradicably kind but strong and truthful . &nbsp; CHARLESRose , I have somethin ' to say to you . Come in . She follows his back into the living room and where he turns and says : Sit down will you ? She obeys . They sit opposite to one another at the familiar table . The window is open , a bird sings outside . She waits . &nbsp; CHARLESI thought I could stand by and let you two burn It out , like I said . But I find that I ca n't . I 'm not sure that I ought to have tried . But anyway I ca n't . So . . . I 'm going to leave you .  --  182  --  He keeps his voice quite steady , not showing what it costs him , thinking the announcement of much less concern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a solid object in the face . But she has formed a settled conviction that she has forfeited all rights , even to an opinion . &nbsp; ROSY . . . Very well . She makes an involuntary movement to escape , but : &nbsp; CHARLESSit still a bit Rose . What about you ? You and him ? &nbsp; ROSYNothing . &nbsp; CHARLESWhat d' you mean , nothing ? &nbsp; ROSYIt 's over . &nbsp; CHARLESOh . . . He is disturbed . His rival had seemed - as rivals do - impregnable . An unpleasant thought strikes him ; awkwardly : &nbsp; CHARLESIs this because I - ( indicates his rolled up nightshirt ) - went ? And stayed away ? &nbsp; ROSY ( shakes her head ) No . It 's . . . over . &nbsp; CHARLESHave you told him ? &nbsp; ROSYNo . . . &nbsp; CHARLESHe does n't know then ?  --  183  --  &nbsp; ROSYYes , he knows . . . &nbsp; CHARLESHow ? &nbsp; ROSYHe must . . . CHARLES looks at her , then half-sad and half-envious : &nbsp; CHARLES . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? &nbsp; ROSY ( after a pause , a search for the true answer ) We were , yes . CUT Section Details LONG SHOT LONG SHOT . RANDOLPH , tiny , approaching the cross at Killin 's Cross , over the marigold marsh , the sea behind him . CLOSE SHOT , he walks , smoking a cigarette , looking down at the tufted and puddled ground . When it gives way to the road surface , he looks up absently and recognises the bus stop at which he was dropped . He looks at it with mild , detached interest , throws away his cigarette , then taking his case from his pocket , limps on across the road and away from us , wandering over the brown landscape , inland . CUT In the schoolroom a silence which CHARLES breaks . &nbsp; CHARLESRose , you must tell me the truth : D' you think you 're ever going to forget him ? She looks at him and can not answer . Which is answer enough . He says : &nbsp; CHARLESNo of course not . He 'd be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rose , am I right ? &nbsp; ROSYYes you 're right . It 's busted Charles . I bust it .  --  184  --  CHARLES pauses . Forward then . &nbsp; CHARLESNow . . . Have you thought what to do ? &nbsp; ROSYNo . &nbsp; CHARLESWell I have . I do n't think either of us can stay in this village . &nbsp; ROSYNo . &nbsp; CHARLESTime I move on anyway . And you were never suited here . She looks at him . He goes on : &nbsp; CHARLESI 've reckoned up . I 've got about two hundred pounds ; and this ( the furniture ) - without the gramophone - should fetch another fifty . We 'll split it down the middle . She stares at him with a kind of horror and gets up quickly , going anywhere , galvanized : &nbsp; ROSYOh , do n't . . . &nbsp; CHARLESWe 're not enemies , Rose . ROSY feels it too , passionately , but his continuing concern for her are coals of fire . CUT RANDOLPH sits amongst heather . Hill country . An unsmoked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face as stiff and ashen as on the day of his arrival . He is looking towards : LONG SHOT his POV , the sea , miles distant . The sun coming over it now , past its zenith .  --  185  --  The cigarette burns to his fingers . He does not start , but looks at them absently as though they belonged to somebody else . Then he flicks away the cigarette , with an easy jerk of the wrist . CUT A brick smashes through one of the schoolhouse windows , coming straight at us from the playground where : A few of the village YOUNGSTERS , excited by what they have done , one with his arm drawn back to hurl another missile . But McCARDLE entering " BOYS " gateway , at the head of half the village , angrily : &nbsp; MCCARDLEStop that ! There 's to be none of that ! The playground filling behind him , he comes on .

He throws open the schoolroom door and stops short , seeing :  --  186  --  CHARLES , alarmed and indignant , the domestic door behind him open , staring in amazement from the crowded playground to : McCARDLE and his party . &nbsp; MCCARDLEOh , you 're back are you ?

ROSY standing , alarmed in the living - room , hears : &nbsp; MCCARDLE ( O.S. ) Not you - They enter , look at her for a beat , the men grim , the women with satisfaction . CHARLES pushes in and goes to ROSY ; he tells them : &nbsp; CHARLESGet out ! Go on - get out ! &nbsp; MCCARDLEShut up Shaughnessy. ( to Rosy ) You . You 've been tried and found guilty .

And ( voice shakes ) betrayed Tim Leary . Now who lives near enough ? Who had time enough ? Who would ? Who did ? ( he points ) That bitch you call your wife ! CUT Section Details THE MOB IN THE PLAYGROUND - WELL WORKED-UP NOW - BANGING ON THE DOOR The mob in the playground , well worked-up now , banging on the door and windows , shouting ad lib .

The village was down on the beach - &nbsp; MRS MCCARDLE- Except you - &nbsp; MOUREEN- You came late .  --  188  --  &nbsp; CHARLESWe came together .

Could they Tom ? CLOSE SHOT RYAN hesitates , croaks : &nbsp; RYANNo . . . CLOSE SHOT ROSY at him while on SOUND : &nbsp; CHARLES ( O.S. ) Why not ? &nbsp; MCCARDLE ( O.S. ) Because Tom went in there himself and cut the wire . CLOSE SHOT ROSY . &nbsp; MCCARDLE ( O.S. ) Did n't you Tom ?  --  189  --  CLOSE SHOT RYAN . He opens his mouth . He looks at : ROSY looking back at him . RYAN looks away . Tries to speak again . OLDER MAN , uncomfortable mutters : &nbsp; OLDER MANIt 's a terrible thing is this for Tom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CLOSE SHOT RYAN , knuckles in his mouth like a child , while on SOUND : &nbsp; MCCARDLE ( O.S. ) But since he 's here he 'll have to speak . ROSY stares at her father , hearing : &nbsp; MCCARDLE ( O.S. ) You went in there yourself now , did n't you ? RYAN . Even the women look at him with sympathy . He whispers : &nbsp; RYANYes . ROSY stares at him , an appalling suspicion flowering behind her eyes , hearing : &nbsp; MCCARDLE ( O.S. impatient ) Well ? . . . An you cut the wire ! Did n't you ? RYAN writhes . He looks at the grim-faced self-appointed judges , hears the mob . He cries out : &nbsp; RYANYes . . . ! And dashes , choking from the room .  --  190  --  CLOSE SHOT , ROSY looks after him quite certain now , hearing his hasty stumbling footsteps , the school door open and close , the mob going silent for the stricken hero . &nbsp; MCCARDLE ( harsh ) Well ? What d' you say now ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the women ) Take her out . CHARLES has never been in a fight in his life . He has no idea how to set about what he must do . He says , rather uncertainly , screwing himself up , ending on a slightly pedantic note of determination , very incongruous , but every sinew tensed : &nbsp; CHARLESNow . . . Now . . . You are takin ' her nowhere . ROSY looks at him . So does McCARDLE . He understands there is going to be trouble from CHARLES . He looks , warningly at the other two MEN . Then , to the WOMEN : &nbsp; MCCARDLEOut . They go for her . CHARLES rushes for the door . One of the MEN sticks out a foot and CHARLES goes sprawling . Lying on the floor he sees ROSY hurried out by the two WOMEN . MRS McCARDLE and MOUREEN haul her across the schoolroom with unnecessary force ; approaching the door she sees : The crowd , falling to expectant silence . CHARLES comes thundering through the schoolroom . The MEN overtake him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among a bodyguard of WOMEN , twists back her head to see :  --  191  --  CHARLES . He comes struggling from the schoolhouse with the three MEN hanging into him , like some large mild animal goaded to desperation by dogs . He breaks free of them and lunges after ROSY . Someone shouts , " Stop him ! " and two VILLAGERS rush after and grab him . He turns , flailing , and catches one of them fortuitous backhand swipe in the face . The MAN goes mad , his expression vicious , he punches CHARLES in the stomach . CHARLES gasps but now must fight back as others run up , the cruelty contagious . It is all ugly , scrambling , inexpert ; they are overcome by a frantic anxiety to hurt . CHARLES flails like a windmill to no effect . We see his mouth cut , glasses smashed , clothes torn . ROSY is against the far wall of the playground , now , held by MOUREEN and MRS McCARDLE . She jerks involuntarily towards CHARLES and they take the opportunity to lock her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurled violently to the ground . The uproar subsides . Half a dozen men sit on him . McCARDLE gaps towards his wife : &nbsp; MCCARDLEDo it then ! In complete silence , CHARLES his face to the playgound , sees : His POV , the WOMEN draw away from ROSY in a semi-circle . MRS McCARDLE has relinquished her hold to another WOMAN and stands before ROSY like an executioner . Now a WOMAN from the semi-circle comes silently and gives something to MRS McCARDLE , then goes back to her place . They are instinctively improvising a ritual punishment . We can not see what the implement is , but when ROSY sees it in MRS McCARDLE 's hand she braces herself . She throws one swift glance at : CHARLES , her POV , across the playground . CLOSE SHOT , CHARLES , as before staring , seeing : LONG SHOT his POV . The WOMEN gather round ROSY in a silent shuffling rush . ROSY twists violently away from MRS McCARDLE , dragging MOUREEN with her , wrenches her arm free . Hands claw at her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she goes down under a heap of struggling , black-clad female bodies . A MAN laughs , half-awkward , half-excited . It gives the cue , other MEN laugh . It is sport , a rough joke . They gather round , spectators , craning over one another 's backs to see . But the struggling WOMEN snarl and fight in deadly earnest .  --  192  --  CHARLES as before , eyes wide with horror . ROSY rears to her feet again . The top of her dress is hanging now , a white undergarment revealed . MOUREEN on the ground is wrenching at her skirt , beside herself with rage . The fight is not aimless ; they are trying to hold her still . A WOMAN pins her from behind but she wrenches free and strikes the WOMAN in the eye with her elbow . She gets a tremendous round arm smack in the face for it ; she disappears again . Violence begetting violence , the WOMEN struggle savagely , mad to get at her ; it is not funny and : CHARLES turns away his head , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WE TRACK BACK - CLOSE ON RYAN AS HE COMES STUMBLING UP THE ROAD We TRACK back , CLOSE on RYAN as he comes stumbling up the road , away from the schoolhouse . His rubbery face is twisted with anguish and damp with tears , his mouth is open in a silenced cry of protest . He lurches erratically towards us , driven , seeming almost to be thrown about by the SOUND of the uproar from the playground . He almost sobs : &nbsp; RYANPrincess . . . Princess . . . Princess . . . Suddenly the uproar stops . It is succeeded by a silence which frightens RYAN still more . He stops and listens , fearfully . A sudden shout , triumphant , dying away to silence again , sends him reeling on , clutching his hair . After three beats of silence , uproar again - this time sheer bedlam , an ugly noise comprising equal parts of laughter , hate and triumph . RYAN throws himself against the wall , throws his forearm across his face . FATHER COLLINS , hastening down the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and looks at the Publican amazed . &nbsp; FATHER COLLINSWhat - What is it man ? RYAN can only indicate the direction of the school , beseechingly , his knuckles in his mouth , looking like a vast corrupted infant . The PRIEST tears off on thundering boots , white hair standing , black skirts flapping . The bedlam continues on SOUND . We arrive with him at the playground gates . He hurls himself through the " BOYS " entrance and : Is blinded by something which flies through the air and strikes him in the face . He snatches at it , and stares at :  --  193  --  ROSY 's grey dress in his hand . He looks up from it , incredulous and glares round . He sees : Two OLD WOMEN whispering over ROSY 's white underskirt . They look up and when they encounter his darkening eyes , drop it , turn and pulling up their shawls , shuffle swiftly out by the " GIRLS " exit . Others who see the movement and its cause , follow them . FATHER COLLINS looks after them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fresh burst of laughter from the bedlam . GENERAL SHOT his POV . Garments and shoes fly through the air ; the YOUNGSTERS whoop and jump to catch them and : CLOSE SHOT YOUNG MAN jumps up and catches something , turns breathlessly laughing to show his prize and encounters : FATHER COLLINS ' black browed glare . The YOUNG MAN drops : A pair of pale green artificial silk bloomers . YOUNG MAN and other YOUNGSTERS go . The crowd is thinning and their departure leaves only a few stragglers and the hard core round the dwelling door . These now turn to see the cause of the dwindling uproar , and as FATHER COLLINS comes in amongst them , the uproar dies to silence . FATHER COLLINS , his face still but his eyes like a glimpse into a volcano , sees : In a YOUNG MAN 's hands , one of ROSY 's black cotton stockings . On the ground , her bodice . Her petticoat . MOUREEN makes a sudden movement , hiding something behind her back . In the silence and stillness the PRIEST strides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staring down at something , his face changing . He stoops for it , out of frame and : CLOSE SHOT . A thick shank of hair . His hand comes down and takes it up : He looks from the hair in his hand , all round and sees : Tufts of hair scattered all round .  --  194  --  A pair of sheep shears in the hand of MRS McCARDLE . She is scared , but sets her mouth stubbornly and looks back at : FATHER COLLINS ; he dare not trust himself to speak or move . Behind him McCARDLE , quickly : &nbsp; MCCARDLELook here Father - ( the Priest turns ) - the strippin ' of her was an accid - The PRIEST lunges forward and strikes him in the mouth , a real punch . McCARDLE reels back among his friends then jerks forward , white-faced and vicious . But it is only a reflex and FRIEND , says quickly : &nbsp; FRIEND- Steady , Joe . McCARDLE , wiping his mouth with the back of his hand , glowers sullenly : &nbsp; MCCARDLEYou 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; FATHER COLLINS ( nods . Quiet and flat ) That 's what it 's for . And draws back his big bony fist for another blow . It is not a gesture ; another second and the blow will land . &nbsp; FRIEND ( quick and low ) Come on , Joe - FATHER COLLINS does not even watch them as they go , but hears on SOUND their clattering boots and : &nbsp; MCCARDLE ( SOUND aggrieved , darkly ) It 's not right is n't that . A Priest 's only a man . The PRIEST is only too conscious of it , looking from the shank of hair to the little shut door of the teacher 's dwelling . Almost fearfully , he raises the latch and opens it , going in . In the " BOYS " entrance , MICHAEL hovers , looking up the street after :  --  195  --  His POV , McCARDLE and the hard core , going away . OTHERS more distantly ahead of them . MICHAEL blinks . Evidently he has missed some kind of communal festivity . Honky-tonk MUSIC strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ROSY 's petticoat on the blunt spikes of the dividing wall . The breeze gently stirs the flimsy stuff . MICHAEL goes to it . He stares at the embroidered daisy-patterns round the neck , the threaded blue ribbon . He looks round cautiously . He knows vaguely that what he is about to do is wicked . But the temptation is too great . He touches the petticoat . It is an act of great courage . His breath comes short , and his eyes stare and move in his head , little tremors shake him as he struggles with the storm of feeling raised in his mind by the touch of the embroidered stuff under his horny fingers . When he hears the dwelling door open he pulls his hand away as though scalded and looks frightened when he sees : FATHER COLLINS emerging , looking at him . He has seen what MICHAEL is doing , guesses what he is feeling , knows it is nothing to fear but to pity . But he himself is feeling about a hundred years old , and defeated . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying in the absent-mindedly peremptory tones in which one addresses an importunate dog : &nbsp; FATHER COLLINS ( quietly ) Come on , come on - He shoves him quite roughly through into the street and drags shut the ill-fitting , a seldom-used gate . MICHAEL watches , uncomprehending , as he does the same for the " GIRLS " gate . Are ROSY and CHARLES imprisoned then ? Or in need of protection ? Cut off anyway . And now his unaccountably angry friend is standing guard at the shut gates and gesturing at him , dismissive and curt : &nbsp; FATHER COLLINSGo on Michael , get off - MICHAEL backs off and hovers , reproachful . FATHER COLLINS snaps . &nbsp; FATHER COLLINSGet off out of it !  --  196  --  MICHAEL turns , the honky-tonk desolate , and leaves the road for the open country and the sea . The PRIEST looking after him , hears on SOUND the honky-tonk fade and falter to silence . He pauses one beat . There is nothing to be done for the moment . He flings off up the road , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CUT Section Details ROSY SITS BOLT UPRIGHT IN ONE OF THE EASY CHAIRS ROSY sits bolt upright in one of the easy chairs . She is wearing CHARLES ' overcoat , nothing else . Her face is white , her hair has been shorn in places to the scalp , stands elsewhere in grotesque coxcombs . A dreadful blue red graze disfigures her cheek , her forehead is scratched . From time to time she fights to control a spasm of nervous trembling . Her head is slightly cocked ; her eyes stare hard , inwardly , searching for some order in the mental chaos . CHARLES is seated opposite to her . His clothes are torn and dirty . His mouth needs a couple of stitches ; one eye is closing , not prettily . His knuckles are raw . He is looking at ROSY , but not well focussed . He too is in a state of shock . Outside , an indifferent bird sings sweetly . Now he goes into the kitchen . He gets from the back of a cupboard a half-bottle of brandy . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the remaining contents of the bottle into the glass . About half an inch . He takes her hand and puts the glass into it . She makes an effort , drinks , the glass knocking against her teeth , and feels better for it . When CHARLES sits again , she offers the glass to him . He shakes his head . She offers insistently . He takes it and drinks what is left in a single swig . It makes him heave . ROSY 's head has turned . She looks out of the window . Then at the fire . Thoughtful . . . CUT MICHAEL . Honky-tonk , lonely . A faint wind flicks at the sword-grass about him and sprinkles white sand into the folds of his clothes . He must have been sitting for a long time thus , motionless , sucking his thumb . He takes it from his mouth now , disturbed by something . His head turns and he looks about him , puzzled ; sees nothing ; his head turns the other way . He scrambles out of his sandy hollow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is standing at a distance on the crest of one of the sand dunes , his back towards MICHAEL , motionless , hands loosely clasped behind him , looking out to sea . He looks as lonely as MICHAEL .  --  197  --  MICHAEL is deeply interested ; hopeful too - this is company of a kind . He rises . But he is more scared than anything and hesitates , regarding : RANDOLPH 's back as before . Quite still . Now his head comes round , drawn by the pull of MICHAEL 's regard , or some even less tangible awareness of MICHAEL 's presence . He looks at him , his white face aloof and detached as ever ; turns his head back again . A second 's pause however and he turns right round , his whole body rotating on his uneven feet , and : CLOSE SHOT shows him looking back at MICHAEL with a kind of puzzled curiosity . It is enough for MICHAEL . He moves towards RANDOLPH with a pleased little grunt , limping over the soft sand . But he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up almost longingly at : RANDOLPH , his POV , looking down . His dark-eyed gaze might have stopped anyone we feel . Then very gradually his face changes to a new thought . It softens , becomes attentive and friendly , and finally he smiles , and says - as a lonely man might encourage a well-met mongrel stray : &nbsp; RANDOLPHHello . . . ? MICHAEL grunts again with pleasure and ascends the sand-dune eagerly . Arrived at the crest he looks into RANDOLPH 's face . RANDOLPH looks back , equally at a loss to explain the encounter which he has so uncharacteristically encouraged . MICHAEL looks to see what his friend might have been looking out to sea at , but : His POV , there is nothing there but the shimmering sea . RANDOLPH regards him seriously , taking out his cigarette case . MICHAEL looks back from the horizon to his friend . RANDOLPH lights his cigarette , still looking at MICHAEL as at some interesting natural phenomena . But in the act of putting back his case it occurs to him to offer him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is the last . MICHAEL does not at first understand . Then reverently he takes it , considers it and puts it in his waistcoat pocket . RANDOLPH watches all this closely . When MICHAEL looks up at him again , the two disparate creatures exchange the same serious regard . Deliberately , with a very faint smile , RANDOLPH offers him the case . MICHAEL looks from the case to its owner , gravely . Then he slowly takes it . The world has become magical ; anything is possible . Slowly , courteously , he salutes . RANDOLPH gives MICHAEL a little half-smile and a nod and descends away from him , going in the direction of the sea .  --  198  --  Sadly MICHAEL looks down at : RANDOLPH , walking away . But he stops . He seems not to want to go without his companion . He looks back and up . POV MICHAEL the invitation is unmistakable . He stumbles eagerly down to him . RANDOLPH , half-regretting the impulse , walks on immediately . But MICHAEL falls into step and walks with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reassuring half-smile , rather quizzical , amused by his own situation , and walks on . LONG SHOT shows the pair in profile , both with the uneven dragging gait , proceeding through the sand-hills . Honky-tonk continuing RANDOLPH looks before him . But MICHAEL slightly behind , looks at RANDOLPH . He notes that his friend walks with his hands clasped behind his back . Gravely he does the same with his own . They leave us thus , two pairs of crippled feet , two pairs of clasped hands . CUT In the living-room , ROSY is dressed now and her hair is covered by a shawl of pale wool . She is looking into the fire , composed now but more thoughtful than ever . CHARLES , clean shaved and in clean clothes , and with iodine on his face and knuckles , regards her anxiously , beneath bent brows . ROSY makes a little movement , revealing the passage of a painful thought , and CHARLES : &nbsp; CHARLESWhat ? She blinks at him . Her face is chastened ; in a quiet , wondering voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the one . . . that betrayed that man . The full depth of her unpopularity revealed to her for the first time , has shaken her . But CHARLES is furiously angry with the village , the full depth of its depravity revealed to him .

They just - just wanted it so . And they wanted it to be you . ( darkly ) For other reasons . ( he scowls to himself ) Truth was told , they envy you . . . ( more mildly ) Always have . . .

She picks something up from the floor by her chair and , much as one gets rid of a used rag , puts it quietly on the fire . It is her hair . CHARLES starts and looks at her . But she is watching it burn without emotion . The end of a Chapter . CHARLES watches too : The burning hair . CUT CLOSE TRACKING . MICHAEL lurches slowly over the soft sand of the dunes ; his hands are in his pockets now and his serious eyes are fixed on ; HIS POV RANDOLPH 'S back , his hands in his pockets , strolling ahead . The declining sun throws long shadows from the dunes and spear-grass through which they walk . He steps , seeing between two dunes , the beach beneath them , the sea at half-tide ; MICHAEL 'S curragh waiting at a distance , throwing a long shadow towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strange little vessel . MICHAEL is pleased by his interest . But has better things to offer . He plucks shyly at his friend 's sleeve . RANDOLPH turns his head and looks at him enquiringly . Eagerly MICHAEL beckons . RANDOLPH reluctant . MICHAEL beckons more eagerly yet . Obligingly , RANDOLPH moves ; and MICHAEL plunges down and away from him , back into the white sand valley . CLOSE SHOT , in a shadowed cleft of sand , a thick shrub of the dark spear-grass . MICHAEL dives into it like a dog after a rabbit . RANDOLPH wanders up as MICHAEL emerges grunting dragging : One of the long rifle-boxes , heavy as a coffin . He looks up , pleased with himself ; he has sprung a delightful surprise . RANDOLPH looks seriously from the box to its owner . Stoops , but MICHAEL anticipates him , throws back the lid , disclosing : CLOSE SHOT , rifles , grenades , bullets , boxes ( ammunition and detonator ) . They glint dully in the low sunlight ; the wind hisses softly through the spear-grass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RANDOLPH crouches and : Touches the too familiar objects with his finger-tips , attentively . MICHAEL is gratified by his absorption ; offers him a Mauser rifle . Quietly RANDOLPH takes it , works the breec and lays it by ; looks again at MICHAEL . MICHAEL offers hand-grenades RANDOLPH looks at these also , and lays them by . Looks at MICHAEL once again . MICHAEL , anxious to please , gives him the red painted tin we have seen before , its lid open . RANDOLPH 's eyebrows go up , and he gently takes out one of the sticks of explosive . MICHAEL does n't understand his friend 's interest in the dull stuff , but is happy to fall in with it . He too takes out one of the sticks . Each of them has one now . MICHAEL peeps through the neat round hole in the centre of his slab at RANDOLPH , who almost laughs . MICHAEL peers closely at the contents of the red tin , endowed with importance by the interest of his friend . He has noticed only one feature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and comes up with the round primer . RANDOLPH 'S face changes as MICHAEL like a five year old child , pleased with a newly acquired skill , fits it into the round hole and peeps again at RANDOLPH through the much smaller hole , drilled in the primer . RANDOLPH goes still . Only one thing is wanting to make the stuff lethal . Very gently he begins to empty the rifle box , item by item , onto the sand , MICHAEL watching . RANDOLPH looks up and freezes as MICHAEL produces from its far end a small square wooden box . Slowly RANDOLPH replaces the hand-grenade he is taking from the rifle box , all his attention on the thing in MICHAEL 's hand . He hesitates and holds out his hand for it .  --  201  --  MICHAEL becomes wary . Evidently this is the jewel of the collection . He opens the little box and when RANDOLPH makes a stealthy moveme towards him shuffles back a little on his bottom . RANDOLPH would stand no chance in a chase and desists . MICHAEL peers into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packed in rubber and cotton waste , the metal detonators , like shining pencil-stubs . MICHAEL 's fingers come in frame and withdraw one . TWO SHOT , RANDOLPH watching him alertly , MICHAEL frowning at the thing in his fingers . Cautiously RANDOLPH reaches forward and removes the primed explosive slab from MICHAEL 's reach Then : &nbsp; RANDOLPH ( firmly ) Michael , give that to me . MICHAEL smiles mischievously ; he was right ; his friend desires the little box and its carefully packed contents . He pulls the box towards himself , his little red eyes glittering with amusement and pleasure . RANDOLPH simulates an infantile sulk , turning away . &nbsp; RANDOLPHAll right , keep it . I do n't want it . . . ( hurt ) I thought we were friends . And begins to repack the rifle-box . MICHAEL , worried , shuffles back to him , pats his arm , and offers him the box . A beat , and RANDOLPH almost snatches it from him . MICHAEL starts back . He still has the first detonator in his hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MICHAEL is amazed at the importance which his friend gives to the little shining object . Slowly he puts it in his mouth ; his teeth closing on it . RANDOLPH alarmed : &nbsp; RANDOLPHNo . . . Look . - He takes one of the detonators from the little box and tosses it through the air to land on an outcrop of rock . It explodes with a flash and a bang . MICHAEL , horrified , casts his detonator from him . It lands in soft sand at RANDOLPH 's feet . RANDOLPH snatches it up . MICHAEL is trembling . RANDOLPH smiles reassuringly , but he backs off holding  --  202  --  up his hands beseechingly , whimpering . RANDOLPH , stricken , takes a placating step towards him . At which MICHAEL gives a sort of tiny scream , backs , turns and runs from him . &nbsp; RANDOLPHFor Christ 's sake man - I 'm not going to Hurt you . MICHAEL turns back at the head of the dune , looking down at : RANDOLPH staring up at him , distant . POV RANDOLPH , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backing ; drops gradually from view , turning to run again at the last moment , leaving the empty skyline . CLOSE SHOT , RANDOLPH looking after MICHAEL , absorbing his own isolation . He sighs quietly and turns his head towards : LONG SHOT his POV . The curragh on the empty beach , the quiet sea , the sun low over the horizon . CLOSE SHOT RANDOLPH , attracted by the vacant scene , takes a slow pace or two towards it ; stops , seeing : The sun , a pale white disc , suspended over the horizon . CLOSE SHOT RANDOLPH . The eventlessness of it all is deeply gratifying to him . He sits quietly , to watch the sun 's quiet death . The sun is almost touching the horizon now . CLOSE SHOT RANDOLPH watching it . Unconsciously he is tossing the bright detonator gently in his hand . His face is clear of thought or emotion . But now a local light comes on it from below . He looks down at : His POV , the box of explosive , less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him invitingly from the opened lid . The explosive visible inside . CLOSE SHOT . RANDOLPH looks back to the sun and sees : It is lower yet . CLOSE SHOT RANDOLPH . The glow of light from the box more insistent still . He looks again at : The box as before .  --  203  --  CLOSE SHOT , RANDOLPH . The little movement of his hand ceases . He looks down at : EXTREME CLOSE , the detonator in his fingers . He rotates it and the highlight of its curved bright surface flashes at him in the sun 's light . BIG CLOSE RANDOLPH , he looks from the detonator at nothing for a long moment , then raises a perfectly calm face to : The sun . It touches the horizon . CLOSE SHOT RANDOLPH , watching it . The sun . Half hidden below the darkening sea . CLOSE SHOT RANDOLPH , the sunlight on his face dimmer . The sun , its last elipse about to disappear . It vanishes and : A flash of light and a soft roar ; it is CHARLES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living-room . He turns up the wick and the illumination spreads . When it reaches ROSY and spreads over her listless face they hear a distant boom , not loud but full of power . They look at one another , surprised , curious , faintly alarmed . In the silence the windows faintly rattle , once , and then comes the crying of agitated gulls . ROSY listens , hard , frowning . &nbsp; CHARLESIt 'll be the soldiers . . . &nbsp; ROSYSoldiers . . . ? &nbsp; CHARLESAye , the beach is fairly littered with . . . stuff They 'll be destroying it . . . sensible explanation . &nbsp; ROSYOh yes . . . But her breath comes more and more rapidly ; apprehension seizes her ; she moves restlessly , and suddenly rises , going to stare out of the window in the direction of the camp , and almost in the same movement , galvanic , goes quickly to the door .  --  204  --  CHARLES follows . ROSY emerges into the playground , dusky , the mad crying of the birds suddenly loud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stands there , speechlessly . ROSY stares back ; MICHAEL advances a hesitant pace ; his mouth opens , but he can only stare at : ROSY . CHARLES appears in the doorway behind her ; his expression is straightforwardly anxious . But on her face is a deepening appalled apprehension . Because : MICHAEL is looking at her now , not merely with chaotic excitement , but with deep curiosity ; and pity . He takes a half step towards her , makes a funny little gesture of comfort . At which : MUSIC " Wings " over CLOSE SHOT . ROSY slowly pulls her eyes away from MICHAEL , absorbing the news as though he had spoken it ; looks sharply back and reads confirmation on his face ; her gaze wanders round the playground and slowly up to the crying birds , seeing nothing . We hear on SOUND ; &nbsp; CHARLES ( sounds apprehensive but sensible ) What is it , Michael ? But , MUSIC over , ROSY unhearing seems to be staring with shocked comprehension at : The Celtic Tower where she and RANDOLPH met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murmur . The woodland clearing . Empty . Dusk . No sound . No movement . A heron motionless at the pond . The empty cave . Shooting from its rear towards the sea . A wave comes hissing up the sloping floor . It wallops softly against the walls . Recedes ; leaving the empty sand immaculate , taking the MUSIC with it . CUT Section Details LONG SHOT LONG SHOT . ROSY seems to be staring at all this . But is dressed now for travel , seated on a rope box in the living-room , her hair concealed by her best hat . The light comes and goes through the window , playing on the cold ash in the empty grate , the vacant shelves , the furniture and  --  205  --  remaining ornaments with coloured tags for auction . Behind her , a lidded basket corded up , and a couple of big cheap cases . Now CHARLES comes ; dressed for travel too ; he glances at her , says nothing , takes the two cases and goes . ROSY raises her head , listening to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MICHAEL and a little OLD MAN , indifferent as an animal , holding a small donkey on the further side of which stands FATHER COLLINS , who helps CHARLES tie the cases on its panniers , the little beast between them . He looks at CHARLES but CHARLES works in silence , throwing a rope over for him to secure . Now we hear the rhythmic tramp of feet and a Section of SOLDIERS march past the playground on the way to the Camp . They are whistling " Good-bye Tipperary " and as they pass we hear the NCO : " Pick up the step - pick it up " - a wisecrack from the offender , laughter , and the whistling recedes . &nbsp; FATHER COLLINSWell they 're not mourning long . &nbsp; CHARLESNo . &nbsp; FATHER COLLINSDoes she think he did it deliberate ? &nbsp; CHARLES . . . She says - He breaks off , tightening and tying a rope . &nbsp; CHARLESI think he was a man that suffered , Father Hugh . The PRIEST looks at him with quiet approval . &nbsp; FATHER COLLINSYou love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( takes refuge in the ropes again , then Yes . He is moved . But :  --  206  --  When ROSY in the living-room looks up hearing his returning feet and he enters , his face is as dispassionate and severe as before and he says almost curtly : &nbsp; CHARLESReady then ? &nbsp; ROSYYes . But does n't move , except to look slowly and sadly round : The forlorn room , about to be abandoned , all CHARLES ' little comforts gone . CHARLES looks too , then back at her . He says quietly : &nbsp; CHARLESNot all your doing Rose . I should not have married you . &nbsp; ROSYNo . She rises slowly , picking up the box . &nbsp; CHARLESYou can tell Father Hugh what we 're doing if you like . &nbsp; ROSY ( quickly ) No no . . . ( and goes ) He shuts the domestic door with a final thump . They go out through the empty schoolroom , she carrying the roped box , pass three or four large wooden boxes by the outer door , and emerge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COLLINSRosy . . . &nbsp; ROSYFather . . . She smiles . But he purses his lips at her frail appearance . He pats her arm , then cheerfully :  --  207  --  &nbsp; FATHER COLLINSWell it 'll be a fair day for a journey yet , I think . &nbsp; ROSY ( smiling ) I hope so yes . CHARLES comes and gives him the school keys , for the last time . PRIEST takes them . Looks at the remaining baggage . Robustly : &nbsp; FATHER COLLINSWell now , how shall we manage ? CUT pp. 173-192 &nbsp; pp. 208-217 LONG SHOT THE STREET LONG SHOT the street . HOUSEHOLDERS , men and women , at their doorways looking towards CAMERA . Now , as at a signal , those nearest to us go in and shut their doors , and the action is repeated away along the cottages until the street is perfectly empty . One WOMAN has to run across from her neighbour 's house to her own at the last minute , shutting her door with a bang . But one of the shut doors opens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into CLOSE SHOT . She has a bunch of flowers in her hand and looks off at : The OLD MAN and the laden donkey , followed by MICHAEL with the gramophone horn FATHER COLLINS , also burdened , followed by ROSY with her box and CHARLES with the base and turntable of the gramophone . A cottage door opens and from the dark interior a WOMAN 'S VOICE , sharp : &nbsp; WOMAN 'S VOICECathy . . . Come in . LITTLE GIRL looks towards her home , back to the approaching procession , does n't budge . But now her father 's voice comes , not vicious , certain of the rights and wrongs of it , the child to be protected from herself : &nbsp; MAN 'S VOICECathy - Am I to take my belt to you ? The child 's face puckers ; she drops a few of the flowers and goes . CLOSE TRACKING , FATHER COLLINS sees grimly : His POV the donkey clip-clopping ahead , the LITTLE GIRL going in , door slam .  --  208  --  CLOSE TRACKING CHARLES AND ROSY have seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She obeys . They look very formal , coming on , seeing : Their POV the empty street , the shut doors on either side . Their escort in advance . CHARLES ' eyes are on the scattered flowers in the roadway . He looks stoical , but the incident has upset him . CLOSE SHOT the flowers . CHARLES AND ROSY stop . He disengages his arm and picks up one of the flowers . He tries to put it in his button-hole . ROSY likes him for it . Puts down her box to assist in it , both aware of : CLOSE SHOT the dimly seen face of LITTLE GIRL peering through her cottage window seeing : Her POV , the husband and wife in the middle of the street . Now the little task is done . They go on , arm in arm again , formal but : CLOSE TRACKING ROSY and CHARLES . He looks ahead , set and patriarchal . But she looks sidelong and scared towards : The blind windows and shut doors tracking by on her left . Now she looks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear seeing : The yellowed lace curtain at one of the windows falling back into place . A baby is crying somewhere . LONG SHOT , the strange little procession moving up the middle of the absolutely empty street . CLOSE TRACKING ROSY and CHARLES as before . She looks back from the house-fronts gliding back in total silence . Licks her lips and manages tremulously : &nbsp; ROSYRousin ' send-off . CHARLES simply tightens his grip on hers ; she yields thankfully . CLOSE TRACKING FATHER COLLINS and MICHAEL . Looking ahead they see :  --  209  --  Their POV the pub approaching . Five or six men emerge hurriedly and disperse . CLOSE TRACKING ROSY and CHARLES also see : Their POV the pub , the men disappearing into their respective houses . One must pass them . He does so without a word . CHARLES and ROSY passing on again , he saying softly : &nbsp; CHARLESWe 'll be out of it in five minutes . At the pub the procession stops . ROSY goes towards the door . CHARLES going with her , she stops him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; CHARLES ( faintly puzzled but stopping ) Yes of course . . . She goes quickly in . In the dark bar RYAN is seated at a table with a bottle and a glass , his face resting on his outflung arm . He turns his head as his daughter comes in and looks at her fearfully , dare not speak . She approaches a little , smiles and says : &nbsp; ROSYDad . . . At her quietly affectionate tone , he lifts his head ; but still can not speak . She in the same reassuringly everyday tone : &nbsp; ROSYGood-bye , Dad . &nbsp; RYAN . . . ' bye , Princess . ( and bites his lip ) &nbsp; ROSYI 'm all right .  --  210  --  &nbsp; RYAN ( sitting up , staring at her ) Are you , darlin ' ? &nbsp; ROSYAye . I 'm lookin ' forward to . . . Dublin and that . Really . &nbsp; RYAN ( nods ) That 's your mother speaking . ( looks away and back ) D' you remember your mother ? &nbsp; ROSYA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? &nbsp; ROSY ( rueful little laugh ) Aye . &nbsp; RYAN ( quick ) I never raised a fist to her , Rose . She understands that her mother is standing in for herself . Her smile goes , she says gently and seriously : &nbsp; ROSYI know that , Dad . You would n't hurt a fly ; if you could help it . She goes and gives him a quick kiss , and withdrawing says : &nbsp; ROSYI 'll write to you . &nbsp; RYAN ( brightening , reinflating ) And I 'll write to you . &nbsp; ROSY ( smiles , affectionately dubious ) Well , mebbe . . .  --  211  --  &nbsp; RYAN ( passionate ) I swear to God , Princess - I will write every - every - &nbsp; ROSYAll right Dad , we 'll write regular . Good-bye . She is going , but RYAN : &nbsp; RYANOh . Well wait a bit I must say good-bye to your husband - He is at the door ahead of her ; here turns and : &nbsp; RYANYou know Rose , when you married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Now I 'm not so sure they come much better . Will you tell him that - ? It 's not a thing one chap can easily tell another . ROSY stares at him ; then with a jerk of the head at the door , quietly . &nbsp; ROSYCome on . In the street RYAN grips CHARLES ' hand ; emotionally : &nbsp; RYANGood-bye Shaughnessy . &nbsp; CHARLESGood-bye Mr Ryan . His manner is just correctly warm ; RYAN means little to him . But RYAN retains his hand , peering moistly from his son-in-law to his daughter who stands at CHARLES ' side . He wants to do more . &nbsp; RYANAre you - all right for money you two ? I - I have a bit by me . His voice falters . ROSY is looking coldly . But then she relaxes : &nbsp; ROSYWe 're fine for money , Dad . Good-bye .  --  212  --  RYAN watches . His POV . The procession leaving , ROSY and CHARLES linked arm in arm . He suddenly calls after them as throwing a parting gift . &nbsp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He looking ahead , unflinching ; but ROSY 'S eyes widen fractionally and her lips part at the irony of it . They walk on . RYAN looking after them , becomes aware of sounds in the street ; he turns to see : People coming out onto their doorsteps to watch the retreating outcasts . They hesitate , seeing RYAN . He ducks back into his pub . CLOSE TRACKING . ROSY and CHARLES , hear behind them a shrill inhuman trilling . CHARLES ' mouth tightens ; he glances sideways at ROSY who looks ahead , affecting not to hear . The VILLAGERS gathered in the street looking after them , the YOUNGSTERS whistling . CLOSE TRACKING , ROSY stumbles . CHARLES tightens his grip again . The VILLAGERS again , the whistling at full volume , shout after the outcasts between the echoing houses . MOUREEN triumphant . CUT The sound cuts to silence over LONG SHOT Killin 's Cross . We can make out ROSY sitting on her box , FATHER COLLINS standing by her among the other baggage , with MICHAEL . CHARLES talking to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An immense sunfield sweeps towards them over the bare country . CLOSE SHOT ROSY seated , lost in sad thought , unheeding the gulls ' cry about her . But now she is suddenly flooded in sunshine . Gulls ' shadows . FATHER COLLINS looks up and says , cheerfully : &nbsp; FATHER COLLINSAh . I thought it 'd brighten .  --  213  --  &nbsp; ROSY ( looks up obligingly ; cheerfully ) Yes . CHARLES joins them . &nbsp; FATHER COLLINSIt 's brightened up for you , Charles . &nbsp; CHARLESAye , so it has . They all look after : The donkey and OLD MAN going back . None of them has anything to say . MICHAEL looks at the absently cheerful face of the PRIEST , the absently stiff face of CHARLES , the fragile seated figure on the box . He blinks about , and wanders away . &nbsp; FATHER COLLINSYou have n't an address in Dublin , yet , I suppose ? ROSY rises and quickly - &nbsp; ROSYEr , No not yet . We , er - &nbsp; FATHER COLLINSHotels is it ? You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll charge as much as five the night . He looks away up : LONG SHOT the inland road along which the bus must come , stretching away over the empty country from the distance . Nothing stirring . Peewits cry down the wind . &nbsp; FATHER COLLINSWell I wonder how long we shall have to wait . . . ? &nbsp; CHARLES ( consults his gunmetal watch ) Not long , if he 's on time .  --  214  --  &nbsp; FATHER COLLINSWell he 's never that . A little social laughter , quickly dying . The wind blows over them . &nbsp; FATHER COLLINSNo . Sometimes late , sometimes early , never on time . . . This expansion of his previous point elicits only pale smiles . &nbsp; FATHER COLLINSHe makes up his timetable as he goes along , like . &nbsp; CHARLES ( chuckles politely and ) Precisely . ROSY looks at him involuntarily , then away and : &nbsp; ROSYHe sometimes does n't come at all . She looks towards the village , blinking in the wind . We hear on SOUND over this : &nbsp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . . . Suddenly , the wind has blown ROSY 'S hat off . Her hand flies up instinctively . Too late . Her hand rests among her disfigured hair . CLOSE FLASH SHOT CHARLES . One second of stillness and he is gone after the hat . He chases it over the bogland , angrily , lips moving in silent curses . CLOSE SHOT ROSY has not reacted other than to look downwards , seeing the gulls ' shadows gliding on the surface of the road . FATHER COLLINS ' eyes are fixed on the tufts of hair blowing in the wind . After a second , not looking at her , he puts an arm about her shoulders , tightly . At which she looks up and away but does not otherwise move . CHARLES comes and gives her the hat . She says unsteadily : &nbsp; ROSYThanks.  --  215  --  &nbsp; CHARLESBus is coming . VERY LONG SHOT . The tiny bus appearing in the distance . CLOSE SHOT MICHAEL , with a fistful of cow-parsley , looking at the bus . Turns to look across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking towards the tiny oncoming vehicle . MICHAEL comes on frame , limping hesitantly towards them . Half way across the road he stops and grunts peremptorily . They turn and see : MICHAEL , standing off , thrusting his ungainly bouquet at ROSY . He is weeping helplessly . It is a phenomenon no-one has ever seen before . &nbsp; ROSYMichael . . . MICHAEL ventures a little nearer but still hands off . He dare not come near enough to offer his gift . ROSY goes to him , takes them from him and : &nbsp; ROSYThank-you . . . He peers at her wonderingly . She steps closer yet and kisses him . Overwhelmed he goes and sits on a stone with his back to them . She goes back to the others , head bent over the flowers . They look at her but when she looks up she is dry eyed and curiously composed . She remarks : &nbsp; ROSYThat bus is takin ' its time . &nbsp; FATHER COLLINSNo hurry . . . He 'll get you to Ennis before the train . He is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchange a quick unhappy glance behind his back . He turns back . &nbsp; FATHER COLLINSWill it be hard to get a job in Dublin , Charles ? &nbsp; CHARLESNot if it 's a teaching job .  --  216  --  &nbsp; FATHER COLLINSYou 're never thinking of changing your trade ? &nbsp; CHARLESThinking yes . I 'd like a change . &nbsp; FATHER COLLINSWell why not ? You 're both young enough . The bus rattles up and stops , its engine banging , loose parts rattling . &nbsp; FATHER COLLINSI 've got a partin ' gift here Rose . ( hands from his pocket a cheap gilded frame ) It 's supposed to be a fragment of St. Patrick 's staff . I do n't suppose it is though . She looks at him and can not speak . He has performed the more important of a father 's duties towards her all her life . He gives her a rough kiss . &nbsp; FATHER COLLINSGod bless you child , get up . And half shoves her into the bus . He turns to CHARLES , brisk and cheerful . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dim scratched window ROSY sees : The PRIEST and her husband fetching the luggage . MICHAEL rises , turns and sees : Through the glass , dimly , ROSY looking straight ahead . She has forgotten his existence . FATHER COLLINS hands the last thing up to CHARLES . CHARLES is relieved to be cutting the last awkward knot . The PRIEST is leaning one hand on the bus , looking down . &nbsp; CHARLESWell Father , thanks . Thanks for a great many things . And holds out his hand . But the PRIEST looks up and grunts at the outstretched hand as at a trumpery social form .  --  217  --  &nbsp; FATHER COLLINSMp . Charles , I think you have it in your mind that you and Rosy ought to part . CHARLES stares astonished . &nbsp; FATHER COLLINSYes I thought as much . Well mebbe you 're right . Mebbe you ought . But I doubt it . And that 's my parting gift to you . That doubt . God bless . And bangs the rickety door in CHARLES ' face . Over his back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born away from us . He turns and walks towards the front of the vehicle . The PRIEST stands and watches as it recedes . MICHAEL creeps on frame and joins him . When it is gone , he turns . He looks not like a happy match-maker but tired , sceptical tired of it all . With a sigh the more bitter for being unconscious . &nbsp; FATHER COLLINSI do n't know . . . I do n't know at all . . . He raises his eyes to the distant village where he must return . Quite grumpily , putting his hand on MICHAEL 's shoulder , propelling him into motion : &nbsp; FATHER COLLINSCome on , then . We leave them thus , going back . LONG SHOT . The bus speeding away over the coast road to Dublin . MUSIC , CREDITS . THE END pp. 193-207 &nbsp;
