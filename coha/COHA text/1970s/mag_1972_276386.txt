DURING China 's long years of isolation , her diplomats and officials raised inscrutability to an art , hardly ever wavering from the approved line of Maoist rhetoric and propaganda . Even in today 's more relaxed and affable atmosphere , China 's leaders seldom give outsiders any real insight into how they look at their world and that of the West . Some unusual glimpses , however , were recently accorded TIME 's Canadian National Correspondent James Wilde , who accompanied a trade and diplomatic delegation from Ottawa on a ten-day tour of China . During an evening of conversation at a restaurant overlooking Peking 's Shi Cha Hai lake , a high-ranking official and party member who asked to remain anonymous talked at length and with uncommon frankness to Wilde . Excerpts : <P> " Basically we Chinese do n't hate the Americans . We just hate everyone , and Westerners like Marco Polo were more objects of curiosity than people we could take seriously . I still say China is the center of the earth and in ten years ' time , the gods being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than ever before . At the moment , China is beginning to change from a colony of blue ants to a more sophisticated and worldly nation . But , and I say this being well into my cups , paradise can be very boring . Jesus Christ or even his Father could visit China and be amazed at the transformation that we have made , but I am absolutely certain they would n't want to live here . <P> " We Chinese have never fallen into the pitfalls of a monotheistic religion . If there were only one god , then one 's chances of getting into paradise would be very slim . So we have deities who cover every eventuality whom we placate annually , all of them endowed with one or more of our human faults ; therefore , we are well covered because surely one of the gods will have pity on us and let us into heaven . <P> " You must remember that our army is really an armed political force . It is not the type of army you have in the United States or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsible person ' is usually a military man , whether he be in the factory , commune or civil service . My great fear is not that we 're going to take the course that you Westerners are so frightened of-expansion in Asia . What we 're afraid of is that this temporary lull in the Cultural Revolution may end and we will become victims of a new Cultural Revolution and the puritanism it produces . "
