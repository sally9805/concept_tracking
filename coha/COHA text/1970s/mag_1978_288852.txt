Two views of power , Shaw 's and Ibsen 's , in Ontario <P> The lust for power is the unifying theme of the two plays that opened Canada 's annual Shaw Festival at Niagara-on-the-Lake , Ontario , last week-but not power for its own sake . The central figures in both works , one by George Bernard Shaw and the other by Henrik Ibsen , are secular Salvationists who dream of bettering mankind 's lot . One thrives ; the other is doomed . <P> MAJOR BARBARA by Bernard Shaw <P> Shaw was a born preacher who loved to toss firecrackers of paradox into the pews of respectability . <P> On the firing line here are two mettlesome protagonists . Barbara Undershaft ( Janet Amos ) , a major in the Salvation Army , proudly marches under its motto of " Blood and Fire " and does the Christian God 's goodly work among the poor . Andrew Undershaft ( Douglas Campbell ) , her munitions-tycoon father , marches under the maxim of " money and gunpowder . " And yet this merchant of death is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he feeds and houses his workers so that they can find their souls , while she drugs the poor with a soup-kitchen dole . <P> But the play is less polemical than comedic . It begins . with a family confab in Lady Britomart Undershaft 's London town house . Long estranged from Andrew , the haughty lady ( Betty Leighton ) knows her select social turf , but that 's all . Daughter Sarah ( Janet Barkhouse ) is enamored of a bean-brained fop ( Briain Pet-chey ) and Barbara is in love with Adolphus Cusins ( Tom Kneebone ) , an impecunious teacher of Greek . <P> Summoned home after a 20-year absence to underwrite these marriages , Andrew is most concerned that Barbara should be squandering her high passion on the Salvation Army . He agrees to see her shelter if she and Cusins will visit his cannon works . At the shelter , we meet sycophantic derelicts , ruffians and pitiably broken men . But it is Undershaft who nonchalantly breaks Barbara 's heart , and opens her eyes . He signs a check for 5,000 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that the Salvation Army shelters may stay open . When the Army 's general accepts the money , Barbara breaks down , sobbing , " Drunkenness and murder ! My God : why hast thou forsaken me ? " <P> But the cold Shavian in Undershaft would say that only illusion has deserted her . He has previously expressed his creed to Cusins : " Have you ever been in love with Poverty , like St. Francis ? Have you ever been in love with Dirt , like St. Simeon ? Have you ever been in love with disease and suffering , like our nurses and philanthropists ? ... I have been a common man and a poor man ; and it has no romance for me . " At the arms plant , with disconcerting alacrity , Barbara and Cusins accept the Undershaft inheritance , saying they plan to " make war on war . "
