THEGODFORGOTTEN by GLADYS SCHMITT 312 pages . Harcourt Brace Jovanovich. $6.95 . <P> The Godforgotten are the nuns and monks of St. Cyprian , as Novelist Schmitt calls her island , and it seems that God forgot them-or so they thought-in A.D. 997 . In those years just before 1000 , theologians were predicting the imminent Second Coming of Jesus Christ ; with the end of the millennium would come the end of the world followed by the Last Judgment with infinities of sinners standing naked before the Lord . When an earthquake and tidal wave struck , washing away St. Cyprian 's connection with the mainland , its people simply supposed that God had emptied the rest of the world , forgetting the survivors on St. Cyprian like so many grains of salt in an empty bag . <P> One century later , enter Father Albrecht of Cologne , a desiccated Benedictine monk , sent by Rome to restore to the church whatever wayward children he may find on the island . Somehow it all works . Part of the merit is in Author Schmitt 's economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Purified to small purpose at great cost " ) . Part of it , too , is the tantalizing , gradually unfolded history of marooned St. Cyprian : the early , apocalyptic piety , the later license , the hallucinogenic crops , the bloody rage . And finally the second cataclysm : the shock of realization and rebirth when Father Albrecht arrives with the news that the outside world exists after all . <P> If books could be read where they might most be enjoyed , this one would be saved for a bleak day at Mont-St. - Michel , with the high tide rolling gray against the rocks and Gregorian chant echoing in the mind .
