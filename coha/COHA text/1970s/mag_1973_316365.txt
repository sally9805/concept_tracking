JONATHAN LIVINGSTON SEAGULL <P> Directed by HALL BARTLETT <P> Screenplay by RICHARD BACH <P> and HALL BARTLETT <P> If one must spend the better part of two hours following the adventures of a bird , far better that the hero be Daffy Duck than Jonathan Livingston Seagull . <P> Jonathan , for the information of any recluses who might not have heard or misanthropes who just do n't care , is an adventurous seagull who wants to " fly where no seagull has flown before , " to " know what there is to know of this life . " This angers his flock . An outraged Elder announces , " You are henceforth and forever outcast ! " , and Jonathan takes it on the wing . <P> He seems to fly into a series of picture postcards of Yosemite , of Death Valley , of the frozen North . Eventually , settling down in the snow , he expires , his tail feathers quaking as he gives up the ghost . The ghost , however , will not be given up so easily and flies off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructed in higher wisdom by a bird called Chiang , whose lessons in life and philosophy and heightened consciousness take a hint from Dale Carnegie , a leaf from Dr. Norman Vincent Peale and a volume from Kahlil Gibran . Thus enlightened , Jonathan is apparently reborn . He returns to his flock and spreads the good word in a sort of Sermon on the Garbage Mount : " Listen , everybody ! There 's no limit to how high we can fly ! We can dive for fish and never have to live on garbage again ! " <P> Not that he actually talks , of course . Jonathan and the rest of his feathered friends are real birds-not mechanical , not animated-but their voices and interior monologues are rendered by actors . James Franciscus speaks for Jonathan , Juliet Mills for his love interest , Hal Holbrook for the Elder , Richard Crenna and Dorothy McGuire for Jonathan 's parents . None of these actors has chosen to be included in the film 's credits , a privilege only the least charitable would question . <P> Jonathan Livingston Seagull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ score by Neil Diamond ) piece of moral uplift since the musical version of Lost Horizon . Years hence , scholars may debate the significance of the fact that the wise elder in Shangri-La and the wise bird here are both called Chiang . Surely it is no mere coincidence . A homage , perhaps . Or maybe a moment of mystic communion , a stroke of magic enlightenment of the sort that Jonathan is always shoving his beak into . <P> Richard Bach , who wrote the original book , is much agitated over this film version , which has allegedly altered many of the " ideas " in the book and his original screenplay . The book has about as many ideas as The Little Engine That Could ; in fact , buried under all the vomitous theosophy , it has the same idea . Ideology aside , the movie 's casting could open up a whole new style of film making . Think of it : Pigeons on Mean Streets , about a bunch of tough young New York birds . Or what about a remake of Four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
