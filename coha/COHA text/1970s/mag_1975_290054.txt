There is no such thing as an economic equinox . There are thousands of corners , millions of corners . Each household went into the recession at a different time . Some never did . And it 's the same with business . We are at a stage where some things are still going down , some things are even , and some things are going up . <P> <P> Thus did Secretary of Labor John Dunlop sum up the import of an unusually large number of economic statistics released last week . As he indicated , they were mixed , but even that marked somewhat of an improvement over the uniformly downward trend of recent months . More important , the figures confirmed earlier hints that the economy 's slide , while still continuing , is far less steep ( TIME , March 24 ) . <P> Those results encouraged some Government officials and businessmen to speculate that the recession is bottoming out and an upturn can be expected shortly . General Motors President Elliott M. Estes went so far as to say , " The recovery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . More likely , the economy will struggle at about the present level for a few more months until it accumulates enough strength and vigor for an upsurge . " The economy now is like a plane pointed upward after losing altitude , " says Walter Heller , who was chief economic adviser to both President Kennedy and President Johnson . " It is pointed up all right , but it is still losing altitude . " <P> Superficially , last week 's most important indicator showed unrelieved gloom . During the first quarter , real gross national product-that is , output of goods and services minus price increases-fell at an annual rate of 10.4% . That was the biggest quarterly drop since the Government began keeping those figures in 1947 . Moreover , it marked the fifth consecutive quarter of decline . <P> Shrinking Inventories . But the drop was caused almost entirely by the largest sell-off ever in inventories ; manufacturers , wholesalers and retailers disposed of $18 billion worth of unwanted stockpiles of goods . Since the working off of inventories is a prerequisite to economic recovery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the G.N.P . decline . In addition , says Alan Greenspan , President Ford 's chief economic adviser , " if we had monthly data on real G.N.P. , they would show a large decline from January to February , a more moderate decline from February to March , and since then only a small decline . " <P> Other key and sometimes contradictory indicators : <P> &gt; Industrial production , which has been declining sharply for the past five months ( down 3.5% in December ) , dropped only 1 % in March . <P> &gt; Personal income continued to increase in March , though its rate of growth did not equal February 's . Industrial payrolls , reversing a four-month-long decline , gained at an annual rate of $300 million in March .
