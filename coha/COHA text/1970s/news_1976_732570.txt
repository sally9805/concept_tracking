txt Priscilla Stevens . 23-year-old holder of a brand-new bachelor 's degree in elementary education , has n't found a teaching job Neither have thousands of other would-be teachers Last year . barely more than half of all June education graduates were able to find work in or related to teaching , and the market this year is shaping up no rosier But Priscilla is n't worried " I 'm confident somebody will hire me , " she says . That 's because she enjoys a big advantage over her competitors Her resume shows that she graduated from Lesley College here in Cambridge No , that 's not Wellesley misspelled It really is Lesley Though few people outside teaching ever have heard of tiny Lesley ( founded in 19091 , it has earned a reputation as a first-class teacher 's school Last year . 81C1 of its graduating seniors found jobs in education , as did sn of its graduate students who sought jobs This year .

" The business metaphor is appropriate . because Lesley cultivates a businesslike approach to education It employs market research , tries hard to keep its school-system " customers " happy , operates some of its educational programs as profit centers and does n't shrink from cost-cutting to keep its budget balanced . Its graduates get an edge in the job market partly because Lesley stresses the practical classroom experience that teacher recruiters like At many schools , education majors begin practice teaching only in their senior year .

Every undergraduate does some classroom work in each of her four years at Lesley " Our students are professional by the time they leave us , " Mrs says , " and do n't have the typical growing pains of a first-year teacher . " Anticipating Demand Employers are impressed . " Lesley students ask much more professional questions than students at other schools , " says a recruiter in a big Canadian city whose school system hired five Lesley graduates this year . " At Lesley , " he says , " they ask what types of tests we use to place students in special education classes . At other schools , they want to know the price of milk and the cost of living here .

Wimett , who got an advanced degree from Lesley last December and began teaching in February at a junior high school in Walpole , Mass . Some of Lesley 's ventures , however , have failed to pay off . The college dropped $50,000 in two years on a day-care center that closed in early 1973 . " We thought there would be lots of federal money for-day care , but it did n't come through , " says Don Orton . president of Lesley . An experiment in open education also flopped . The idea was to encourage informal learning among a group of children with several teachers in a large , nontraditional classroom setting . But open education , Mr. Orton says , is losing favor " because of a conservative trend in teaching back toward the traditional three R 's .

" Each program is a kind of profit center , submitting monthly accounts of income and expense to determine whether it is paying its way . " We 've changed the focus from a curriculum presided over by a tenured faculty to one presided over by the needs of consumers , " says William L. Perry , dean of the graduate school . " We 're trying to develop an entrepreneurial , competitive spirit within the school , where each program coordinator sinks or swims on his own . " The undergraduate school , however , is managed conventionally with authority di- vided between administrators and faculty . Lesley expects to enroll 740 female undergraduates next fall and 730 full-time and 900 part-time students in its coeducational graduate school Some of its programs run through the summer For graduate students .

The graduate school has eliminated tenure . the lifetime job guarantee that experienced faculty members at most colleges and universities eventually get New professors at Lesley are hired under contracts for one , two or three years . Later , they may get contracts for six years , but Lesley can dismiss any faculty member in the final year of any contract Lesley administrators say that the lack of tenure permits them to reshape the staff faster to pursue " new directions " in prIllearion Graduate-school revenues at Lesley have risen to 82.1 million a year . 35% ol the 88.2 million 1975-76 Lesley budget , from only $108.000. 5% of the 82 1 million budget in the 1988-69 school year .

" says Edward C. Pomeroy . executive director of the American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education . Lesley has no endowment : teachers ordinarily do n't become rich alumnae More than 90% of its operating costs are covered by tuition and fees . Nevertheless , the college never has run at a deficit For the fiscal year ending this June 30. it has budgeted a surplus of about $80,000 .
