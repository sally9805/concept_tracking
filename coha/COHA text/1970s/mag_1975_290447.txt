The oral contraceptive pill is under indictment once more . This time it is accused of increasing the risk of heart attacks among women over 30 , and especially among those over 40 . The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has just sent a warning bulletin to 600,000 medical professionals , suggesting that they advise Pill-taking patients over 40 to switch to some other contraceptive . <P> It has been known since the late 1960s that for some women , the Pill enhances the dangers of blood clots forming in the legs ( thrombophlebitis ) and traveling to the lungs ( pulmonary embolism ) , with possibly fatal results . The Pill may also cause strokes . That indictment originated with two teams of Britain 's most eminent epidemiologists , now at the University of Oxford . The danger has since been widely confirmed , although the risk that any particular woman will suffer any of these severe effects is statistically small . The latest indictment is based on two later studies by essentially the same research teams . <P> New Labeling . Two months after both reports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Journal , the FDA 's advisory committee on obstetrics and gynecology ( ten M.D.s , one Ph.D. ) met and concluded that a warning was justified . Among British-as well as American-women aged 30 to 39 who do not use the Pill , the incidence of nonfatal heart attacks is only 2.1 per 100,000 . But for those on the Pill , the rate rises to 5.6 per 100,000 . For women aged 40 to 44 , the rates for the two groups are 9.9 and 56.9 respectively . Similar increases are found in the rate of fatal heart attacks : ages 30-39 , only 1.9 per 100,000 nonusers against 5.4 per 100,000 among users ; in the 40-44 group , 11.7 for nonusers and 54.7 for users . The best available figures indicate that 18% of Pill users are in the 30-39 age bracket , and only 6% are over 40 . <P> The FDA announced that it intends to require the inclusion of an appropriate warning in the labeling of oral contraceptives . But this " labeling " does not refer to the little sticker that the pharmacist puts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the fine-print technical information that drug companies supply only to pharmacists , doctors and to the publisher of the widely used book , Physicians ' Desk Reference . Thus it will still be up to the conscientious doctor to convey the warning to his patients .
