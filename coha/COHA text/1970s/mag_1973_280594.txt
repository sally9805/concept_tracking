Columnist Jack Anderson 's readers have come to expect daily bulletins about skulduggery all over , bleak reports that are long on data and short on philosophy . So it was something of a shock last week when Anderson took a deep dive into rumination and surfaced aglistening with optimism . Taking a long view of his trade , Anderson raised a rhetorical question about the muckraker 's role in a time of widespread corruption and scandal . Might not he further weaken the national spirit by encouraging cynicism and despair ? <P> Not a bit of it , Anderson quickly decided . In his view , the muckraker " has more confidence in America than most others . " Why ? Because his work teaches him to respect-and depend on - three American virtues : " First , the relative scarcity of corruption a trait that will come as news to regular Anderson followers . If it were the norm , it would not be news . Second , the probity of most citizens : if the majority found official corruption undisturbing , the cry of the reformer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth , when forced to the wall , of our governmental system . " <P> A wall-forcer of no mean prowess , Anderson backed off long enough to reveal his inner doubts : " Tough though his hide gets to be , the investigative reporter is as emotionally needful of emphatic response as a clown or an actor . " <P> Extending the simile to the pugilistic arts , Anderson concluded : " Perhaps a reporter , like a prizefighter , is in trouble the moment he gets a bit reflective and sentimental . "
