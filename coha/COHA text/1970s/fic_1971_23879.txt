a story by Milovan Djilas T oHE ARMIES CAME AND WENT and the authorities in the little town were constantly changing , and all found joy and solace with her , regardless of their creed or the flags which they waved and which led them through the massacres . But the war could not go on forever , and one army finally won . It had occupied the little town before , but then it could not call itself victorious . Now that army , even though war was still raging furiously somewhere far away , entered as undisputed victor ; the defeated armies had finally withdrawn , leaving behind their piles of ashes , mounds of men shot hurriedly , and all the savagery of hate and bitterness . The victorious army was hound to be also the avenging army , and as it had fought in the name of the idea and the promise of a new life , it had to confirm this by purges , in its own ranks and in the life around it , of what it considered old and hostile , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its faith . Thus she too . the girl with the gold tooth , was brought before a military court  --  since there were still em real courts , the army commanders passed sentence  --  even though she was not guilty of anything except that she liked to amuse herself with everyone and took pleasure in dancing and singing , good dinners and love . She was the prettiest girl in the town ; everyone who dared to say so admitted it . Good husbands did not dare to admit it to their wives lest they reveal their hidden desires , and the young men did not dare to say so before their girlfriends lest they refuse to join them on the corso . When they did not gossip about her , they preferred to keep silent . But the children  --  for they know everything and dare everything  --  sang tauntingly about her beauty , and the old women  --  they forget all that they ever knew and are envious of everything  --  bad-mouthed the hussy who led their grandchildren astray and disturbed the happy marriages of their sons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to be . She came from a middle-class family , the daughter of a respected father and the sister of a well-known fighter for the new life . She was born in the hill country , whence her family had come to settle on the outskirts of the little town in a house with a garden which stretched down to a little stream and the river . Her father had also bought a market garden nearer the town , an orchard and vegetable plot on the far side of the river , right on the steep bank , but the garden could not he seen from the house since it was screened by other orchards and meadows . That ; together with her father 's little pension , was enough to enable them to live peacefully and comfortably . But she did not want to live like other girls ; she was different . Breaking away from the mountain peasant way of life before she was fully grown , she had already in her early girlhood decided to enjoy everything the little town offered : sweetmeats. young men , silk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , what every girl wants if she can get it . She explained , " I am neither one thing nor the other . I want to be a town girl and was never able to remain a peasant . So by chance everything in me is mixed up . " But those with whom she was intimate knew that was not the truth , at least not the whole truth . She was , indeed , a town girl , but not like the others . She had kept something of the freshness and robust . ness of the mountaineer : the tow n girls were for the most part thin and pale . Her body was firm and compact , full , plump , and eager for enjoyment . Strong in the hips and breasts , she had a soft throat and full , unmuscular haunches . Her hands were large and strong but with delicate and cushioned fingers . Her head seemed a trifle bent under the weight of her thick , black tresses . She laughed frankly , blushing coyly like a peasant girl , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sallies . Her skin was dark but she looked after it carefully , and her greenish eyes flashed from under thick brows . She loved ornaments , heavy silver bracelets and huge gypsy necklaces , but her dresses were simple , in pastel shades . in the village she would have been a young woman with hordes of children , game for anything . and skillful at deceiving her husband under his very nose and putting horns on him . In the town there was no hurry for her to get married and she could deceive her lovers to her heart 's content , She could not stand any excess and least of all scandal , but she liked to hear how the women decried her from envy and jealousy . This was not hatred  --  she hated nobody . But it was her only compensation for the bad repute and gossip which she had to endure . She was not mercenary , though she gladly accepted presents and still more gladly gave them . She had a gold tooth , the eyetooth on the right , which when she laughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It used to be said that it was not necessary and that she had had it put in to add to her attractions and had had it done by a dentist , who had stayed for a while in the town , for the love that she gave him . That gold tooth was like a symbol by which she was known and remembered . It put the seal on her beauty , was a sort of invitation , and revealed her tastes . Those who knew her for the most part added to her name the words " with the gold tooth " and she was know n to those who did not know her personally , and did not care what her name was , as " the girl with the gold tooth . " However that may have been , the tooth stressed and outlined her personality . She had not wanted to get married when she was younger and , later . when she had the reputation of a light woman , there was no opportunity despite her father 's pride and the burgeoning of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never too late to get married . I am still in flower ; when I 'm an old bag I will find a way . " Her father used to beat her when she was in her teens ; even then she used to hang aboutkissing in the gateways and bushes and even more often , in the orchards above the river . She went there by preference , even in winter , for on the steep banks behind the willow and alder clumps were hidden dens and little level patches where she could watch out by raising her head a little or remain invisible by holding it down . Later her father kept his hands off her to avoid scandal and because , despite everything , he loved his only daughter as she him . She fussed over both him and her younger brother , regardless of whether they considered her guilty or innocent . c HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABOUT twenty-five years old when the war and the insurrection broke out and foreign armies overflowed the land and intruded into her godforsaken little town and her carefree life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the insurrection , she was neither frightened nor Lew ildered ; the foreign army officers were only interested in her beauty and her way of life , and the locals ( students who knew everything and rigid officials , frightened petty merchants and apprentices ) all in one way or another burnt their fingers at her flame . They secretly desired her , or she bewitched them with her smile and her songs if they had not already experienced her unforgettable embraces and incomparable limbs . She said , half-seriously , " They have learnt love from me and , you see , now they are ready to tear one an-other 's eyes out ! " Therefore she behaved as if the war had changed nothing essential , as if nothing essential in her life could change . There were shortages of materials and of new clothes but , being skillful at sewing , she was always able to appear in something new . The garden and the orchard still bore fruit , the cow gave milk as it had always done , and laborers were cheaper than ever , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Though women became more open and casual , she was pretty enough and young enough and clever enough to be able to go on choosing her men . Changes and difficulties were mainly due to the fact that she was now alone ; her brother had gone to the forests , to the insurgents , where there was a place for him as a student , and her father , after interrogation and preventive custody , had been interned in a foreign land . Vital and independent , she rapidly found a way out , even in her loneliness ; she made friends among the girls and the women left forsaken as she was , and though she became more selective she went on amusing herself freely with men , seeking refuge in flirtations and pleasures to stifle her grief for her brother and father . The most handsome , witty , and impetuous men were the officers of the occupying army . But she did not consort with them willingly , because of her brother and her father , because of the hostility in the town , and also because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coarse bodily satisfac . Lion . If anything took place between her and one of them it was by chance and momentary , in a furtive manner . Luckily , the occupation army did not remain long in the isolated one-horse town , only entering it during temporary offensives against the insurgents . Thus the girl with the gold tooth went on living and enjoying herself as before , paying no heed to which side her acquaintances and lovers belonged . She looked on love as uncommitted and accepted both one side and the other  --  revolutionaries and counterrevolutionaries . The little town was taken and retaken several times and it happened that those who took the place of those who had been there before threatened her and called her a bandit 's whore . Rut she was familiar with armies and accustomed to insults and paid scarcely any attention ; after a few days she would choose a new lover from among the newcomers , if , indeed , he were not one of her earlier lovers , sometimes even from times of peace , for she changed less often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-tried lovers , as all who are skilled in enjoyment prefer . Though the war flared up e ith more and more merciless devastation , only the merest chance , so she thought . could disturb or menace her life . Yet everything was overthrown and destroyed , even her loves ; they took her hastily and without tenderness on the eve of withdrawal and after the shootings had been carried out . And she gave herself more frequently from habit and impatient desire for the return of her former carefree existence than from any carefully considered passion or enjoyment . All that remained was the ghost of her former pleasure . But she was satisfied even with that , as if assured that as soon as the Ivar ended , her real life would he restored , either as it had been before or in some other way . It turned out quite differently , though for the little town the horrors of war diminished as soon as the enemy and counterrevolutionary armies finally withdrew . She too could have withdrawn had she suspected any danger , if she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own borne . T rrurEv ARRESTED HER THE SECOND MORNING after the entry of the victorious liberation army , though she had had a love affair with the enmmissar before the war and had bad frequent love trysts with the information officer even during the war . There were many arrested and therefore , even before the setting up of some sort of courts , they had to hurry with the sentences ; the first shootings were carried out on the evening of the day she had been arrested . From earlier occupations and liberations of the little town it was known that interrogations before the military command were of little importance . merely a part of established and almost ritual order , since the sentences had for the most partbeen decided upon even before the arrests were made . But this time it was the final liberation . The leading persons of the command were her good acquaintances and she did not feel guilty . Therefore she stood before the investigators calmly and even joyfully , though she understood that in war ideas of guilt and justice often changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as upon laws and regulations . She looked at the commissar with recognition and smiled at him , awakening memories and the knowledge of delights known only to him and to her . But he responded with a complete lack of understanding , perhaps even with simulation , and coldly said to her , " For such as you there is no place in our new society ; you have entertained the enemies of our homeland with song and have amused yourself with bandit officers . " She replied with a ringing and involuntary laugh , though chill with apprehension . " I do not ask who has what politics : I took pleasure with and entertained onl y men who pleased me . You at least should know that . " The commissar retorted indifferently , with a harsh smile , " For you , it seems , there is no difference between giving pleasure and amusement to enemies of the people and to fighters for national liberation ! And what do you mean by ' You at least should know that ' ? " Before she could make up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had ever seen him , " I know very well what you meant , " looking at her with eyes which did not want to , perhaps were no longer able to , meet hers . " You wanted to remind me of our former intimacy and , certainly , to influence me , perhaps even to blackmail me . But that was at another time ; the land was not yet occupied and betrayed , and T too am today another , a new , man . Look , here are my comrades ! " He pointed around and only then she noticed the information officer , ticith his pencil poised over his notebook , and a mo ? tionless and attenlive civilian , whom someone had previously pointed out to her as more important than the military commander . though she did not know , and till then had not cared , what his duties might be . The commissar went on , " You see , here are my comrades and T am glad to be able to tell them openly we were lovers , but at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am ready to pay for my fault by repentance before my comrades and objectivity toward you . " He went on speaking but she no longer understood him , though she still heard him ; she realized that she was lost . She could no longer recognize him , with tight hell and made-to-measure uniform , though he was still the man of former times , slim and blond . Her tears streamed . Nonetheless she heard the reserved and mysterious civilian speak up : " Everyone is free in his personal life , but also responsible before the people and society , " and noticed that the information officer , going down a list with the red point of his pencil , certainly a list of those arrested , had put a circle around one of the numbers , certainly the one opposite her name . She remembered her brother and father . But her father was far away in a camp , if he had not already died or been killed , and her brother  --  her brother was on their side . Nonetheless , she pulled heiself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not got an equal right to be one of these new men ? " " Everyone has that right , " said the commissar , sitting down and as if he were talking to someone else . " But he must win it  --  by struggle and by loyalty . We would be betraying ourselves if we had mercy on such people . " The important stranger added , " What would the people who have suffered so much and have paid with their blood think of us ? " And the information officer concluded mockingly , " We would have to resurrect everyone , if we looked aside and let such persons go . " Quite collectedly , she remarked , " You forget that I have a brother in a very high position amongst you ! What will you say to him ? He will never forgive the murder of his sister . " But the unknown readily retorted , as if he had been waiting for just this reminder , " We have kept that in mind . In truth , it touches us nearly that you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you that he is so incensed at such a sister that he has behaved as such a comrade should behave ; he has left it to us to decide , convinced of our revolutionary conscience . " She sobbed , hopelessly . OMEONE GRABBED HER FIRMLY by the arm and 10dragged her away . Certainly that was the information officer , for his voice near her ear shouted to someone , most likely the sentry , to wait at the head of the stairs . The hard hand grasping her arm led her along a long , mildewed corridor and into soft , sweet light , drew her down on a soft , yielding couch , and began to stroke her hair and face with velvety palm , and a voice spoke to her in warm whispers . She pulled herself together and recognized the information officer , who w as reassuring her , holding her hands in his : " We do not spare ourselves in the struggle for a new life . We want to save and to resurrect , not to suppress and to destroy . But we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old order and of all who serve it , and we seek all those who belong to it so that we may root them out . Naturally . we too are men ; we differ from one another and our duties too are different . All eyes are fixed on the commissar ; even if he does not burn with the idea and his duty , he must remain pure and upright . And the secretary of the committee , that other one , who spoke little but wisely , he could be a saint among saints , if we believed that there are such things as saints . I , however , am different and my duties are different . I admit that I am weak about women and that I am forced , in my work , to take advantage of all sorts of people and all sorts of means , for theenemies of freedom and of our people are not subdued by defeat and have no fear of anything . My work , I admit , is dirty and horrible , if it were not undertaken in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the commissar and the secretary . But without such men as me and work such as mine , they would not hold out forty-eight hours , and selfish , evil men would quickly tread underfoot today 's freedom and our dreams of the future . I work in darkness and torment and can do things that it would not become them to do . We two could once more be together , be near one another . You are pretty and attractive and you have something , some sort of frankness and candor in giving which I have not found in any other woman , nor will I ever find . Even more . all sorts of men come to you and you live in circles and milieus which are alien and inaccessible to us . I could convince those two that this is so and that you would be able to go by new paths , and could induce them to show mercy and understanding . Everything , new , depends on you . " " What have I done wrong , what can I do now , that everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tears , listening to him , though she scarcely recognized him , in his tight-belted new uniform , as the man she had known in former times  --  swarthy and dark-browed . Instead of replying , he embraced her . trying to turn her over on the couch . But she pushed him away and stood up . He darted a glance of malicious wonder at her and then shook himself , grinning softly and obscenely . " Surely you know what you ought to do ? You are irresistible and experienced . " " How wrong you are ! " she shouted . " I have never given myself to anyone against my will . I can not , will not , do anything like that ! It is not in my nature ! I am not a whore ! Even were it not for my father and my brother and the citizens , I could not for my own self-respect do anything of that sort . How can you , you especially , even propose such a thing , you who have been , who want to be , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the window , and said , " No one is forcing you , nor can anyone force you . But think it over . Human nature is changeable . There is no whoring in that ! If your brother or father were to hear anything , we would explain everything to them and convince them that service of this kind serves higher ends , just as important as any other . What is important is that you would not be doing it for personal profit , though naturally there would be some personal profit , but for society and the idea . As for my relationship with you , I am not the commissar or anyone like him who must confess and repent . I think that , even if we were not old sweethearts , it would not be unpleasant to have a little fun together . As a man in a responsible position and a man who used to be dear to you , 1 state : In my eyes you would be neither dishonest nor unchaste , since the work I offer you would it fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whit life . " " I would like that , I ought to do that ! " she exclaimed , gazing around her and trying to find something firm to grasp . " But I can not understand ! I can not , I can not ! " His hand . once again firm and unyielding , led her out again . Somewhere in the dark corridor his voice went on mumbling in her ear , " As a man in a responsible position and a man once dear to you , I must tell you : I have already ringed your number and it is up to you tonight , for tomorrow may be too late , to do or not to do what you should do , for yourself , for your brother and father , for society . " Before she could recover herself and think what she should reply , a hand , even harder and stronger , seized her at the top of the stairs and she stumbled down them , sobbing . When they took her to the cell , she brushed away her tears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman suspected of betraying hidden insurgents , and the wife of an officer who had fled , " They will kill all of us . Me too  --  and I do n't understand . I am not guilty of anything . " They interrogated the two other women the same evening  --  a little longer , a little shorter . Then everything was silent ; certainly they had gone to supper . But throughout the night , until dawn , they took away men from the other cells , men who did not return  --  and in the morning the three women hoped that they would be spared one day longer , if they had nut already been forgotten . For they knew that shootings take place at night . Till then all the armies had acted thus . Night has no witnesses and there is less trouble and inconvenience for those who have to do it . Thus daybreak brought not only encouragement but hope , and lulled them with the details of everyday life  --  washing , breakfasting , cleaning , and putting in order the cell and themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was a victorious army which did not always find it necessary to conceal what it did . The guards came for them about noon , when they were least expecting it and still less could conceive , on that bright , warm autumn day , that this was really a shooting , despite the fact that the commissar informed them curtly and icily in the prison courtyard . IV HEY WERE ESCORTED BY A COUPLE of soldiers in I semi-peasant costume and by the information officer ; he was there , so he explained , in case the soldiers might have pity on weak women or might try to take advantage of them . The three women . unbound , walked through the little town , weeping , consoling and encouraging one another . The peasant woman wailed that she had not been allowed to go to confession , though the soldiers tried to convince her of her foolishness and grumbled at her ; the officer 's wife was weeping softly and sadly for her little son , to whom they had not permitted her to say goodbye ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lethargic , and pensive , wondering if this was really happening to her . Certainly it occurred to her to turn to the information officer and accept his offer and to recall his recent flirtation with her . But she did nothing , lost and disillusioned , perhaps already ashamed of such weakness in front of her fellow sufferers and the little town which , deaf and empty , peered at them from behind drawn blinds . The three women knew where they had to go , there in front of the fortress where other armies had carried out their shootings . They went neither hurriedly nor slowly , in step with the soldiers , in the terror and silence of the indifferent , unknown , alien town , by the street which led past the house of the girl with the gold tooth , across the little bridge and into the orchards in the area of her love trysts . They knew that they would be shot and not hanged ; the revolutionaries shot women too , whereas the counterrevolutionaries hanged them because they considered that only a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-known road and to a death they knew . But death itself they did not know  --  that no man knows-and they marched on , legs leaden and glances vague . The girl halted before her house , gazing at the windows through which she had been awakened in the mornings and behind which she had gone to sleep at nights , and from which she had seduced the young men and affronted the conventions of the little town . But the windows were closed and the small , dark , limping soldier shouted at her , pushing his rifle into her back , " Come on , come on , we have more important things to do ! " and his companion . tall and dark , remarked unrelentingly , " If there is anything of yours there , then it is no longer yours ! " The girl moved on without a word , stumbled on the cobbles , and once more took hold of the peasant woman , just as the officer 's wife was holding on to her . They crossed the little bridge . In walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the darkened gardens to the black shingles of her home . The garden fence , through which she had sometimes brought her lovers , was breached and falling down . It had been like that yesterday , a month ago , and even a year ago . But the garden , which the girl had constantly tended , was bright with the color of the still unwithered autumn flowers . Once again it drew her eyes , but the guards were in a hurry and she again stumbled and caught hold of the peasant woman . The women wanted to continue along the road . But the guards turned to the right , along the little path by the edge of the orchard above the steep riverbank ; that way was shorter to the willow thicket in which they carried out their shootings . Now they walked Indian file , along the path by which the girl used to go to meet her lovers , by those hidden hollows in which , between the river and the skies , she had passed many ecstatic moments oblivious of life and death , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with that path and recalled childhood memories linked with the little meadow to the left of the slope , already turning yellow , on which she had pastured the cow and where she used to play with children of her own age ; she went on , attentively and silently , to impress every detail on her memory . The information officer too must have remembered the past and those hiding places : he stamped harshly with his booted heels and looked straight in front of him , sullen and frowning . No one said anything . The women , hurried on by the soldiers , were now themselves hurrying ; it was almost a mile to the willow thicket , there behind the hillock which sloped down to the water 's edge . The guards too hurried . They were already in the open and the women , seeing that they no longer had to walk along the path in single file , once more took each other by the hand , the officer 's wife , the girl , and the peasant woman . They had walked thus for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was in fact two shots  --  struck down the girl 's companions . Perhaps the information officer had told the guards to kill her first and without warning , to shorten her suffering on the long road to death and save her from the horror of gazing into the rifle barrel , and the guards had made a mistake or had attached no importance to the order in which women who were very shortly to die in any case were to be shot ? Or perhaps the information officer had only given a sign and the guards had fired at those on the outside , since they were the easiest marks ? Be that as it may , the girl remained standing there with empty hands , ready to cry out , to beseech , to implore  --  there was no one she could cling to . She turned , ready to cry out to whimper , to remind , or to ask . But the guards were quick and before she could utter a sound both fired at the same moment into her breast . She again spun round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until a short while ago she had been holding hands , and whose hands were warm from her touch , as hers from theirs . The information officer motioned to the soldiers , who slung their rifles , telling them to roll the women down the steep bank into the river . But they did not understand and he explained , " The river is high  --  throw them in ! We have n't time to bury them . Let the waters carry them away . " They obeyed him , first taking hold of the arms and legs of the peasant woman . They swung the corpse as bathers do when fooling around with another bather , and heaved it into the water . Then they did the same with the officer 's wife . But when the thin soldier took the girl by the legs , the limping one said , taking a knife out of his boot , " Ilold on a bit ! This one 's got a gold tooth ; pity to let it go to waste . " As if he had heard what was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the information officer said nothing , but hurried back to the town . 0
