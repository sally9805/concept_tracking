, especially the hill folk , think he is Arthur , come again . I do not say this about him to talk slightingly of him but simply to explain ; I have a great love for him , and gratitude , too . It is not all bastards who are treated the way Owen treats us . Also , I am certain that he knows more about every subject that there is under the sun than any other man living ; there can be no questionof that once you have heard him speak at any length . I was in France so long , and England after , that I had forgotten what Wales looked like . Owen had taken me to France when I was only three years old , to get me away from my mother . I will have to explain this ; Mother was Lowry ferch Morgan , ferch Lowry , ferch Morgan , and so on , supposedly back to the first Morgan , that I am named after who was the one of Arthur 's time . That is , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anyway , Mother was the last prophetess of Dinas Bran ; Dinas Bran is an old , old stronghold , and looks it , too . It is supposedto date back to the first settlers of Wales , who came from some place in Greece , crossing over the ocean on foot on a continentthat sank long ago into the sea . I think it is really silly , but Owen says not to say that sort of thing here . The prophetess thing is supposed to be hereditary and handed down from mother to daughter , and that is supposed to go back to when Wales was a matriarchy , meaning ruled by women . I guess it might have been so once , but it is certainly a misty dream by now , to say the least . Anyhow the prophetesses lived there , in Dinas Bran , sort of like queens , and had maidens , like nuns a bit , and they all worshiped Saint Derfel , who used to be a god before the Christians came , and also , some old goddess called Epona . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spring , I guess , and bless the crops and cut a poor little lamb 's throat over the ground to make it fertile ( it used to be a human sacrifice , Owen says , but that makes me shudder to contemplate  --  things are bad enough as they are everywhere , with executions and wars ) and then they would dabble their fingers in the poor thing 's blood and prophesy . And then they  --  the prophetesses , I mean  --  would bed with the Chosen One , and the daughter would be the next prophetess ! ( I do n't know what they did if it turned out to be a boy ; - strangle it , I guess . ) I mean you ca n't imagine such things going on in modern times . But it did , up until I was born , Owen being the Chosen One at that time . I asked him how he couldp93have gone along with that kind of thing  --  it is so pagan , really  --  but he just laughed and said my mother was very beautiful . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little earlier , because there are quite a few children running around the palace that look like Owen . He is what they call a lusty man , or used to be , at any rate . ) But Owen put a stop to the whole thing by stealing me ; he broke the chain , as it were . He stole me when I was a little baby , and Mother kept plotting to get me back , and finally he took me out of the country . Mother was so enraged and grief-stricken that she killed herself ; she was found hanging by an old girdle , which the people insisted was Princess Myfanwy 's which would make it about a thousand years old and too rotten to do the job . But Owen says , though they are a wonderful people , you can not talk sense to the Welsh . I sound awfully mean and disrespectful about Mother , but , after all , I did n't know her at all . And I certainly would n't have wanted to be a priestess or whatever it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away and became whores at the Tassel Inn , where all the English border soldiers stay . Owen says they were quite wanton anyway , really , and not a bit like Christian nuns . When I first saw Glyndyvrdwy Llyys , where we live now , I was astonished . And that is the last time I will call it that ; I was just trying to show off . It took me a morning to figure out how to spell it in English . From now on it will be simply Glendower House . You really could n't call it a castle  --  it is so different . Owen designedit himself , drawing plans and supervising everything . Now every castle or great manor I have ever seen is made of stone , and always , also , looks more like a fortress , with hardly any windows , except arrow-slit openings . But this Llyys , or mansion house , of Owen 's is wood ! It is true that there is stone under , but all you can see is wood , smoothed and polished so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very dark . Owen had it brought by ship all the way from Cathay ; the Genoese make such trips often  --  they have very fast , strong ships . Owen went on the first trip to pick out the trees ; the wood is called teak and is very hard , and will probably never wear out . It is a very difficult palace to describe , Owen 's , being so different , but I will try . All around the whole thing is a wall , not very high , of this teak wood , too , over stone , and inside there are lots and lots of buildings ; dwellings , barns , stables , storehouses , and everything you can think of , al/most like a city . Except that it is all low , just one story high . Only the main house , in the middle , has two stories ; the top story is all for the women , and is where we live . The downstairs of this building is one huge hall , with a big chimney , built of bricks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is a hearth on each side , so there are four fireplaces , which do a good job of heating , better than anywhere else I 've been . The upstairs is divided into four main rooms , each having a fireplace , as the chimney continues on up . There are screens to divide all these rooms into any shape you might want or to provide privacy ; it is complicated but works very well . There are covered walkways leading to other buildings , where the men of our family sleep , and all the buildingsaround have men and soldiers , minstrels and bards , servants and visitors staying in them . There are no fortifications , except that there are hundreds of men-at-arms and guards right there . Owen does not like to live in a fort , he says ; life should be more gracious than that . He says it is built on the lines of a Homeric palace , that is , like very ancient Greece and how their kings lived . Homer was a great bard of that time , and you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are descriptions of palaces in his poems , and that is how Owen found out about them . But , of course , everything depends on being rich and havinga great many retainers because otherwise the place would not be able to be defended . Owen says the Greek palaces were all open , with many windows , porticoes , wide doors , and openings in the roofs , too ; of course , it was very mild there and even hot most of the time , so he could n't follow that exactly . But we do have a lot more light than most manor houses , only all fhe openings are glazed . Our girls ' sleeping place is open to the sky , with a glass roof , for instance , which is wonderful , sometimes , if you are wakeful and can look up at the stars , and drop off to sleep , counting them . Elliw , one of the maidens who live here , hates this , though , and says she feels exposed , though I have told her only eagles can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we have put a canopy over her bed ; so she feels comfortable . She is an odd little creature , anyway , I think ; she is the daughter of Rhys Dhu , a kinsmen of Owen 's , but a wild hill chieftain , so she has spent much of her early life in caves , which may explain part of it . We girls , and there are a lot of us , live all together under thep95Lady Margaret 's rule ; she is a most fair , though portly woman , Owen 's wife . The people call her the Argyliwyddes , a sort of title . It is old Welsh , which nobody understands anymore , though all the bards pretend to . Some say it means the Englishwoman ; I can hardly credit that , for she can not have more than an eighth of English blood . Her father was Sir John Hanmer , a wealthy border lord ; the family is very old , so maybe , far back , there is English , but the Welsh would count it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am not Welsh myself , but that is because I have spent so much time elsewhere , and also , Owen himself holds that there is little difference between men , even Saracen or Jew . By the way , he says not to say that word , Jew , for it is a sort of epithet among Christian peoples ; he says they are Israelites and should have their correct title . He says that even the peoples of Cathay , who are very different to look at , with eyes that are unlidded and slanting upward , and broad , flat faces , and the Africans , who are black in color , are much the same as the rest of us , having different customs only . Black is a hard thing to believe , but I know that he does not lie . Anyway , as I started to say , we maidens live all together ; there is plenty of room , so we do not argue too much . First , there is Catherine , Owen 's youngest daughter ; she is the Lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us . She is a year younger than I am , just the age of Richard 's queen . People would have it that all us girls are Owen 's , but that is not true . Only Efa and I are his without doubt , besides Catherine . Efa is a nun 's daughter , from the convent at Valle Crucis ; her mother died giving birth . Efa herself says she is Saint Derfel 's , but everybody knows that is not true , unless he was the image of Owen . We three , his daughters , all look much like him , with tawny hair and cat-colored eyes . We are all very tall , too , like him ; I used to be too fat , but I have lost that flesh now and am slender as the others , except that I have too much up top in front . Lady Margaretmakes me wear a sort of binder-cloth ; she says it is more seemly . Then there is Elliw , that I mentioned before , and two daughtersof Tudor ap Griffith , Owen 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and very beautiful , with dark , rosy skins and black eyes . They are bastards , too , though , got on some Celtic princess from the hills ; they all call themselves princesses ,  |p96those  hill women , but the daughters are sweet maidens . They are sixteen already and marriageable , but Owen will have to dower them handsomely on account of their birth . The other damsels are of low birth and could be either Owen 's or Tudor 's , or one of the bards ' ; their mothers , though , are serving maids here . The girls ' names are Olwen , Sibli , Megolin , and Modry , and they are not treated any differently from the rest of us ; of course , they cannothope to marry well , that is all . Megolin , though , wants to be a nun . So , after I have counted , I see we are ten . We all have tutorsand women who teach us sewing and weaving ; we take harp lessons from the bards , besides . In fact , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it is pleasant here . Owen has six acknowledged sons , four bastards and two trueborn . The only one I have met so far is Meredith , the youngest , who is about two years older than I ; they have all been studying at Oxford Town , for Wales has no university , though Owen would like to found one . Meredith was the last to go , so I met him when I came here , almost three years ago . He , again , is like us , resembling Owen ; he is fine-boned , though , and much fairer of hair , getting his coloring from the Lady Margaret . I can not remember him all that well , of course , because I saw little of him , really ; he is coming home though , almost any minute now , with all the others , and heaven only knows how many more , students all . There has been an uprising there at Oxford ; as a matter of fact , there have been a few , and all the Welsh are coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English with them . It seems there is a real coil there , and indeed all over in other parts , too , of England , on account of the new king and his unjust laws . They are even burning people alive there ! It is too gruesome to think on , but Owen says , looking grim , that it is just beginning . Poor , sweet Richard is dead , and un-kinged , too , and Red Bolingbrokeis crowned . Strange to think that little Harry LongTwistis now the crowned Prince of Wales ! One awful thing after another has been happening over there in England ; these last years have been humming with news like a beehive , even here , where we get it late . Owen must have had wind of some events to come when he fetched me from the court two years and more ago . He had just come back from France then , after all , where Henry of Bolingbroke was plotting in his exile . It is a long story , and astonishing and sad , too , so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Lancaster , that is , Bolingbroke , as he is sometimes called , little Harry 's father , though banished by Richard , was still able , in exile , to get the ear of other nobles discontented with Richard 's rule . When he landed in England , more than threequartersof the nobles , with all their retainers , flocked to his banner ; he won the revolt and routed poor Richard , who was never warlike anyway . He forced Richard , who was by then his prisoner , to abdicate the throne ; he did not do what most people expected , place the Mortimer heir , who is the closest blood claimant , on the throne , but took the crown for himself , saying that all men begged for his kingship , and so he was forced to it . Such a thing happened long ago , said Owen , in Rome , when Julius Caesarmade himself emperor by the " will of the people . " Owen says this is nonsense , of course , in both cases . As a matter of fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to get men enough up from Wales to do any good . And so all was lost . Richarddied in Pontefract Castle prison , some say starved to death ; murder is whispered , too . Owen says we will never know the right of it . At any rate , a body was shown , in all pomp , or rather , the head only , the whole being sealed away in a lead casket , to satisfy the people that he was dead , and not from violence , for the head bore no marks . Even so , many say that it was not Richard at all , but another man , his double , called Richard Maudelyne , and that Richard is safe in Scotland somewhere . I privately think this can not be , for I knew that man Maudelyne at court , and he was not so very like to Richard as all that . After all , though Catherine and I are sisters , and look a bit similar , no one would mistake us , in truth . Griffith , my oldest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was Richard , without doubt ; he says , however that a starved creature would show the marks of that , too , so one can tell from his letters that he , Griffith , at least , thinks that Richard was killed somehow ; he even names the murderer , one Piers Exton . Owen says this is hearsay but says , also , that Red Bolingbroke could not afford to let him live  --  Richard , I mean . It is all very complicated and politically mixed up ; there have already been plots against the new king 's life , and his son 's , too . I am glad that Harry did not die ; he was near death from poisoning , it is said . I am so sorry for Harry ; it is easy to imagine how he must feel now . Richard was more of a father to him than ever that grimp98man who is now king . That man used to beat him with a whip ! I myself have seen the old scars on his back , long healed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Also , it is not Red Bolingbroke'sdoing that he even has a son-heir , but Richard 's mercy only ; he was hostage there , after all , when his horrible father got up to all his tricks ! I hate him well , though I have never met him . Owen would say this is wrong , but I guess it is my mother coming out in me . They say that young Harry was drugged at his coronation , when he was made Prince of Wales ( an empty title , if there ever was one , for that is what all men call Owen , in fact ) . They say he would not do his father 's bidding and that he ran at him with a sword , the one Richard gave him at his knighting ; they say , also , that he accused his father of Richard 's murder and was sent off to Oxford to escape his father 's wrath . ( Who sent him , I wonder . None of it makes good sense ; Owen says all gossip must be taken with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , when my brothers come back from there . I keep calling him little Harry . He was shorter than I when I knew him at Richard 's court , but I have stopped growing now ( I hope ) , and perhaps he has not ; we are the same age to a month . Of course , Owen being six feet and a half , we are all giants around here , which scares me sometimes ; I would not like to attainsuch a height as that , with all my suitors looking up at me ! I liked Harry well , the best of all the lads at court ; he is the handsomest , to my mind , of any , though his face does lean a little to one side , and is long and narrow . His color is like some of the Lombards I saw at the French court , dark of hair and eyes , with strong-marked brows like birds ' wings , tilting up and outward , and lips the color of watered wine . I think of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy who conquered practically all the world long ago and was beautiful , too , they say ; Harry alwayswould beat the other boys at play tourney or feats of strength , even those older and bigger , although he never bragged . Catherine says I am half in love with him , but that is silly ; we were just children then . Catherine is very romantic , alwaysfalling in love and out , sometimes with people she has never even seen ; I suppose she thinks all girls behave her way . Anyway , I am anxious to hear news of Harry ; Meredith , I know , has the same master at Oxford there , so will know it all.  |p99I  have spoken of all the many men-at-arms we have living here at the Llyys ; Owen has never been a warrior , truly , though long ago he did serve in the Scottish and Irish wars with King Richard . But these defenders of ours are needed now , for there are constant skirmishes between Owen 's men and the retainers of Lord Grey of Ruthin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been seizing lands which belong by hereditary right to Owen , that is , to us . Grey has also sent them over the countryside , burningand pillaging , raping our women and capturing villages . Not a day goes by but what there is not some new tale of woe or some complaint from the people hereabouts . They look to Owen for protection and also for revenge , though by Welsh law he is not their true lord . It does not work here exactly as it does in other places , like England or France . Here the people are not unfree but hold their lands by rent or purchase . In England , though , they are serfs and can own nothing , but are bound to this lord or that . I am not well versed in law of any sort , but Owen has explainedit a little . Wales has had no king or ruler , really , since Prince Llewelyn lost a great battle with Edward I of England . Owen is the highest noble of the land right now , though he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's king . Now , in Richard 's time , all these lands were granted to my father , but since the revolt and the new king , old Cess-pit Grey has grabbed a lot of them by force , and although Owen has appealed to Red Bolingbroke for justice , and a hearing in law , nothing has happened , except that Grey 's men get bolder and bolder , and are devastating the countryside . So , actually there is nothing for it but that Owen must send out men , too , to fight against Grey 's marauders . So what happens now , is that whole villages change hands ; first they are Welsh and then English , and vice versa . Only , in the meantime , innocent blood is shed , and the poor peoplesuffer ; it is a silly situation . Owen says all wars are , even the huge ones that lay waste a whole nation ; he says this is just how wars start , small , like what is happening here . But , though Owen is a man of peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ king , he must fight ; he can not allow those under his protection to be butchered , or his own heirs to be beggared . Efa , who is a strange girl , finds all this exciting ; she watches for the men when they come home at nightfall and listens for the cries of their bereaved women , for always there are some who dop100not return . The rest of us are saddened , and frightened a little ; the bards sing dirges each night now at hall , and the Lady Margaretsends us girls to bring death gifts to the widows . We are suddenly in the midst of tragedy ; it is even becoming commonplace . Life here has always been so pastoral and sweet , if a little boring . I have not spoken much yet of the bards . They are Owen 's great enthusiasm , though he has many others , of course . I privatelythink , from the design of his house , and from these same bards , that Owen is re-creating , insofar as is possible , in his own life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ musicians here , who play songs of their own composing , on the lute and the mandol , and even the lyre , which is not a popular instrument anywhere else . Owen treats them like honored guests , giving them fine clothes and feasting them , but they are guests who never go home . I think they have no homes , in truth , but will live here always . All large manor households have visiting ministrels , jugglers , too , sometimes ; they are as common as the rain from heaven . But here they are part of our life ; I think , once they come avisiting , they just do not leave , and so there is a whole large building where they live , with a great platform in front ; in fine weather it is like a fair , one show after another . The true bards are another story ; they are , in a way , storytellers , except that they sing the stories and play the harp . There are several of those , too , but they live with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can make you weep to hear them ; but there are two , I think , who must be the greatest poets in the world ( it is hard to explain ; the harp sound is as a background only , to the words , though the harp , too , can break your heart ) . One of the great ones is Griffith Lloyd , a man about Owen 's age , but with no hair on his head , or even , Efa says , anywhere ( she is always spying on the men in the bathhouse ) . His skin is like a baby 's , pink and white , except for his fingertips , which are hard and brown like horn , from plucking at the strings ; his feet , too , have calloused soles an inch thick , for he goes barefoot always , like a friar . He has a huge , craggy head , like a dome , and deep eyesockets under bald shelves of brow ; his eyes look out at you as from caves  --  they are so blue the breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is like a face carved into a mountainside , so large and stern the features , but for thosep101flower eyes . He , like Owen , has a great reputation for getting bastards , but they are not so easily spotted from a hairless father . Some of the girls think Sibli is his because she can play any instrumentwithout even studying and has a lively imagination as well . Privately I do not think so ; she is tiny and dark as a Moor , with eyes as black as raisins . There is so much talk always about who is son or daughter of whom around here ; it is comical in a way . That is because Owen is forever adopting all the likeliest lads and girls ; he can not resist the glimmerings of intelligence wherever he finds it . He says we must stop this speculating about birth ; Owen swears that he has found in hovels , among filth , the long fingers and delicate features that are supposed to be a mark of noble blood and , conversely , among nobles the grossness and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like other men , and holds with none of their common beliefs . He does not even believe in God , though I am almost afraid to write it down . ( Since I have not been struck dead , he is probably right . ) He says man has wondered always about the riddles that be in nature and the marvels that he can not understand , and so has invented gods . All men have done this , he says , time out of mind , and alwayswill , and they are all the same gods , too , but with different names . I hope he does not say these things away from home , for they are burning people for saying much less , in England , with that old hawk , Arundel , watching ! And he is archbishop ! I hate him , too , although I have never seen him . Anyway , that bard , Griffith Lloyd , is Owen 's own bard , sometimessetting Owen 's words to music and usually composing all sorts of songs to the honor of our house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at court , but he was not musical and wrote verses only ; his name was Master Chaucer , and Owen says he was born out of his time and is far ahead of all of us . And they say Red Bolingbroke has a fool , like the Spanish kings , always about him , to make jokes . I suppose he can not think of anything funny by himself . These fools , or jesters as they are called , are usually dwarfs , or born misshapen , so Richard , who loved beauty , never had one . But I remember , at the French court , though it was long ago , that the queen , Isabeau , had a little pet lady , no higher than a three-year-old , that she used to dress up like a doll and carry around ! All the princesses hated this little creature , for she had beautiful clothes and jewels , and they hadp102none but made-over rags and one state dress between them . No wonder the first two were so happy to be married off , even to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , instead of these other kind of proteges . ( That is a French word , but I do n't know how to say it in English . ) There is another bard , too , a very old , old man ; Catherine says he is over a hundred , but she is not always sensible . At any rate , Iolo Goch-that is his name-is a very ancient man . He can nolonger sing , really , for he has no teeth in his head , and his voice , too , is thin with age , but his playing would make a stone weep . He does not play often , for it wears him dreadfully , and afterwardhe looks like death , gray and stark . He will play tonight , inhall , Efa says ; she always knows everything that is going on she is everywhere at once , that one . But something like that must be true , for the Lady Margaret has bidden all us girls to dress in our second-best gowns , and no jerkins or hose either . Of course , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , anyhow , except for Catherine , who hates skirts . I must explain something which will sound peculiar to those in other places . All us maidens wear page 's gear when we ride among them or in sight of the men-at-arms ; Owen says it is more sensible and more seemly , too , on horseback , for our skirts blow up around our waists otherwise . Richard 's first queen , Anne of Bohemia , a lady , of course , I never saw , used to ride a sort of lady-saddle , on which she sat sidewise and not astride . They have these saddles where she came from , but they have not caught on much yet in England , and here we have none at all . I can not imagine how one would not fall off . But anyhow , there is a dreadful coil upstairs here because of this fancying-up ; Efa has accused Sibli of stealing her furred surcoat , and Sibli has scratched her face , so she will look a pretty sight . It serves her right though Efa she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in the pages ' house or the minstrels ' . Lady Margaret says she will not need it anyway , for the hall will be warm with all the crowd . This really makes me curious ; who is coming , besides the usual company ? Which is big enough , in fact . I think I will wear my saffron if Catherine is not wearing that color ; it is my favorite , though the velvet is rubbed a little at the elbows . I will turn it back , though , to show the lining , a nice red , and no one will notice . I wish there were time to wash my hair , but Lady Margaret says not.  |p103There  was so much stress upstairs that I thought we would not ever get to our places at table ; besides the quarrel between Efa and Sibli , the twins Gwynneth and Gwenllian went about sobbingand sulking because the Argyllwyddes would not allow them to dress alike , which they do usually , and no one can tell them apart . There was a kind of queer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although the skies were clear ; our hair crackled as it was brushed , and quick angry words rose all about . We are usually at accord here ; it was most strange . Catherine , who had planned , also , to wear her saffron , was snappish , in reverse , insisting that she would not wear the color and I must . I then said no , she must be the one to go in yellow , and so it went between us , until the Argyllwyddes reproved us for our silliness and forbade the color to either . So it turned out that I wore purpleand Catherine green , by command , and , these being each our most unloved gowns , we exchanged looks of annoyance , making faces behind the Lady Margaret 's back , and giggling . In truth I would not have her job , poor lady ! But then , I never will , in all likelihood , for that I am not true-born , and so will not ever become so respected a matron . Little Elliw , who never quarrels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cry because of all the strife about and had to be comforted by nurse like a baby . Nurse favors her and slipped her a sweetmeat , so all the rest of us clamoredfor one , too ; it was dreadful ! We were like a lot of bad children . And the youngest of us , even , is old enough , truly , to bear a babe , had we lived in the ancient days ! So the Lady Margaret reminded us , scolding ; she is not usually so severe , but , as I say , the very air crackled , and she , too , was perhaps affected . Finally , Efa and Sibli were forbidden hall completely and told they must eat upstairs with nurse , so after , all the rest of us were quiet and seemly , to escape the same fate . I do not feel so very sorry for those two anyway ; they will simply wait till the harping and drinking begin and slip in among the pages . They will be punishedall over again for it , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a wolf than a sheep . Nurse says shep104will come to no good end . Nurse is a very old woman ; she was serving maid to the Lady Margaret 's mother and then nurse to the lady , and now all of us ; no one can remember what her given name is ; she says one name sometimes and then another , so she probably does not even know herself ! She pretends to be very crotchety , but all us girls can get around her ; she spoils us dreadfully . She is very lewd , too , as the old women sometimes are , and the tales she tells us at bedtime , after the Argyllwyddes has gone to her chamber , have made my face flame , even in the dark . By heaven , when I give up my maidenhead , I shall be at no loss how to go about it ! To hear her tell it , one could think our old nurse had had more beddings than ever Helen of Troy even ! But Efa says all old women boast like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last minute , Catherine and I have made everyone wait while we go to the water closet ; giggling , she loosens my breastbinder , while I stuff her front , which is still small , with a silk cloth , which makes her look suddenly grown-up . When we reached hall , the whole world and his brother seemed to be in it . There were men standing in groups in the middle by the hearths and squatting in twos and threes in corners , and there were two extra trestle tables set up at the far end . The chimneys were not drawing well , and there was much blue smoke in the room ; my eyes watered , and I could not at first make out who the newcomers were , but , by my side , Catherine gave a wild cry and dashed into the midst of a group of youths , all in riding hose . I hung back a little , with Elliw , who was alwaysshy , for I did not know them . All the other girls rushed after Catherine , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of delight . I could not be so thickheaded as not to guess that they were her brothers , and mine , too , in fact , so I stretched my neck to pick out Meredith . I found him soon , for he stood a little apart , with two others . Even from where I stood I could see that the whole mort of them were dusty as scarecrows ; they must have just that moment ridden in . I greeted Meredith with the kiss of welcome , and he returned it , on both cheeks , in the French manner , calling me belle soeur , in compliment to my court days . One of his companions was a dark youth , like a gypsy , with a beaky nose , and a look of gawky pride ; he was called a cousin , but some removed , of Owen 's , half-Norman , Rhisiart by name . I was not sure yet whether I liked him . The other was a young man ofp105great self-possession , with a round , smooth countenance , and a smile of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for introductionsflowed all around me by then , all my new-met brothersspeaking at once . They had , all of them , that elusive look of Owen that he stamps on all his get , though they were all unlike , really , except for size . Big young men they were , all , of shades of fairness from flaxen to brown . I felt I must wait to sort out all their names . They were just come from Oxford , as we had expected , with others , too , almost they would make an army among them . Which explained why the hall was so crowded . It was warm , too , with the breath of so many heating up the air , and all the fires going . One of the fireplaces smoked still , though some of the serving men were trying to wave the smoke back and up the flue where it belonged . Catherine coughed , and Meredith thumped her on the back ; out flew an edge of the silk stuffing from her bosom . The dark Rhisiart stared , Catherine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Oh-oh , I thought , we are in for it now ; she will notice my front , too . But Owen himself came up then , to embrace his sons and make all welcome , and so a diversion was created , thank the Holy Mother . I was much surprised to hear Owen 's words to the young round-face . " A hearty welcome , sir , " he said . " And great congratulationsto you . It is not often we are honored by such a celebrity " whocould he be , I wondered , listening for Owen 's nextwords  --  " to confound Arundel and all his inquisitors no meanfeat . I shall expect you in the Saracen Room tonight . . . come with Meredith , after all this . . . " and Owen waved his hand at the company . He brought forward the Lady Margaret . " My dear , may I present Sir Walter Brut , from Oxford , too , and lately of Hereford . . . ? My Lady wife , sir . . . . " I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blotches , a thing that never happened except when she was angered . " I am honored , sir , " she said , holding out her hand . " It is good to know that cruel upstart Arundel thwarted for once . . . . I should like to see him beaten to his knees and stripped of all his powers . . . . " Her voice rose as I had never heard it , and I stood , amazed . Owen smiled , patting her arm . " Women are ever the most bloodthirsty . . . . My Lady is more Lollard than any in thesep106parts even , it might be , than you , yourself , sir . . . . " And then it all came together in my mind , making sense , and I knew the name . For even here , so far away , we had heard of the famous trial for heresy of this same Walter Brut , and how he was acquitted , by virtue of his clerkly knowledge and his nimble tongue . He was the only accused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ! I looked at him again , marveling . He had , in truth , such an open , frank manner , so harmless a look . . . I shuddered again to think of the flames . . . . For the last thirty or forty years , maybe before , there have been Lollards all through the isles of Britain , particularly in England , where Master Wycliffe preached and taught . I do not know precisely how to define the term Lollard ; Owen says it is from old Saxon and means " tares , " another archaic word , which means " seeds , " so it has come to mean in truly orthodox clergy 's minds , " dangerous weeds sown by the devil . " This is Owen 's explanation , not mine ; I personally think a Lollard is just sort of anyone who thinks for himself , especially about religion . Mostly they are believers in the Englishing of the Bible , so that the poor and uneducated , who need the word of God , can get it without going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withholding certain passages . Then , too , they do not believe that the consecratedwafer and wine do actually become the body and blood of Christ , but is a spiritualization only . And other things , too , all kinds of dissension , in fact . King Richard was half a Lollard himself , and the new king 's father , John of Gaunt , was a supporter of Master Wycliffe , and even granted him monies for the finishing of the English Bible , but Red Bolingbroke is somehow thick as thieves with Archbishop Arundel , who is now his chancellor , and there is dreadful persecution in England now , and the Lollards preach in secret or not at all . The new archbishop has even obtainedan edict from the Pope to support it ! It is named De HereticoComburendo , and , of course , means , Concerning the Burning of Heretics . Which means that Lollardy , which used to be just a sign of reason , is now considered heresy , and those found guilty may be burned alive ! People say that one out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it can turn into a holocaust , Owen says . The universities at Oxford are seething with dissent ; they are all Lollards and rebels , even , there . Great numbers of them have been flocking into Wales for the past two years ; there are teach/ers in all the taverns and preaching at every hedge-corner . The worst of it is , says Owen , that old Red Bolingbroke does not even do this persecuting because he believes in orthodoxy or is pious , but for reasons of policy only . He is pushing for the support of the clergy and the established wealthy , who , of course , do not want to see any changes . I heard Owen say to Master Brut , " Forgive me if I put you just below the dais . . . . There are two gentleman of the clergy present , and they must be honored at table , and I fear you might be uncomfortable in their presence . . . . " And the Lollard answeredthat he liked nothing better than to sit among the lowly , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best . . . . Owen laughed loud then , putting his arm about the man , and saying , " It is easy to see how you confounded your questioners , sir . . . but you will not have such very lowly company as all that , for I have placed our new cousin , Rhisiart , next you , and his young Oxford friends . . . . " I looked carefully at this Master Brut and decided that he had the face of a homely angel , if there might be such a thing . Certainly the contrast between this man and our " clergy " guests is remarkable . Father Domitius has the face of a satyr , dark and evil , with red , moist lips , and eyes that strip the serving maids of their bodices . I have seen him pinch them , too , under their skirts , when he thinks no one sees . The other , Father Simon , is a Cistercian , and a mild little man , but fat as a pig from rich pastries , and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clergy are like them , of course ; there are some saints , even among them , but it is fellows like these that give the orders their bad names . The Argyllwyddes came among us then and herded all us maidens like sheep to our places . We sit apart from the men and pour our own wine ; it is as if she thought we might be seduced by the pages as they passed the pitchers ! I find that I call her the Lady Margaret when I like her , and the Argyllwyddes when she annoys me , for it is , indeed , a foolish-sounding title . She is a good lady , though , and kind , mostly ; it is true that the men get drunken quickly , and there are fights often . And so we sat , all panting and bright-eyed with our unaccustomedcompany , looking over the young men , and giggling among ourselves . Catherine whispered to me that she has never yet seen a young man to please her so much as our new cousin.  |p108She  thinks he looks like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is romantic . He watched her , too , whenever she turned away ; when their glances meet it will be a lightning bolt . Catherine looked very pretty ; we had earlier darkened her fair eyebrows with chimney-soot  --  they are her only flaw . There are darkening dyes to be had somewhere , but we have not been able to get hold of any around here , though we all rub beet juice on our cheeks when it is in season . I had brought back all kinds of paints and perfumes from Richard 's court , but they have run out long ago , with all of us using them , and the Argyllwyddes will not let us buy any from the peddlers . It is not fair , really ; she uses somethingherself on her hair . It is too bright , and sometimes there is a line of gray showing at the roots . I suppose she is right , and we do not need such things , but they are fun to play with on a dull day , after lessons . At least , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other , and were also raised on a little dais of our own , so we could watch everything with ease , and not have to eat dishes we dislikedor water our wine down to nothing . I , in fact , could eat no food at all ; I was far too excited . I kept watching Meredith , who fascinated me . He had a sad face , old for his years , but fineboned , and with a kind of shine upon it ; there is a little hook to his nose , and his mouth is too large ; otherwise he would be as woman-pretty as poor Richard . He looked at me too , his lips curving , often and often , and I felt he saw me as fair . What a pity he is my half-brother ; I am in worse case than Catherine , who is looking to fall in love with a cousin only ! Of course , we have all read of those ancient peoples of Egypt and Crete who were ruled by brother and sister espoused in their cradles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kinships are frowned upon in unions . Owen says it is best , for close marriages thin the blood-stock after a time , as in cattle , and make idiots , or worse . The speeches began , but we listened with half an ear ; they are dull and rambling as a rule . Besides , Catherine , who can not spell , was trying to compose a note to that eagle-nosed Rhisiart , and she had all the words down wrong , and I had to help her . We are allowed visitors in our solar upstairs by day , and she wanted to make sure of his company tomorrow . For sure , he will come anyway ; all the young men will come  --  it is a courtesy . The voices from the dais rose and fell , rose and fell . First onep109and then another , and all , in the main , in Welsh , and about Welsh freedom and English oppression ; Owen sat like a statue  --  he has these fits sometimes of seeming to be somewhere else , his eye looking through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but are frightening somehow . Beside him is the Argyllwyddes , in a robe made of little white skins of ermine , with sleeves of gold cloth . She is stout , and I wager she is sweating under it all , while Owen wears a thin linen tunic , with bare legs . On Owen 's other side is his oldest son , Griffith , whom I never had before seen . He is unlike Meredith or any of the others , much stockier of build , and with a face that looks like a clerk 's , small and tight . Catherine , who had abandoned her writing , nudged me and began to giggle . " Look at that great booby , " she said . " He is wearing the belt of Eliseg around his neck ! " The belt of Eliseg , like thecrown of Madoc on Owen 's brow , is a hereditary honor to the wearer . It is the oldest son 's privilege to wear it ; I suppose the Argyllwyddesmade Griffith do it , to please Owen , on this night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catherine that maybe our brother thought it was a gorget , for the neck , and she whispered back that it would not probably fit around his waist , as he takes after their mother , a thing I would not dare to say . We began to giggle helplessly then , and the Argyllwyddes , who misses little , began to frown ; even Owen turned his head slowly in our direction , like a sleepwalker . Oh-oh , I thought , here we go up to our chamber in disgrace , but choking with laughter all the same , when there came a horrible commotion from the courtyard , where the peasant folk had assembled to hear the bard . They were shouting loud , the deep notes of men gruff and wild , and rising above it the shrill thin women 's voices . The doors of the hall were flung open and a great group of soldiersburst in , dragging someone across the flags . I heard , " An Englishman . . . A spy . . . a Ruthin spy ! " We all stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a pack of dogs worrying a fox . I saw Meredith run up to the dais and take his father by the shoulder . Owen shook himself a little and rose , holding up a hand . " Silence ! " he cried . " Stand back ! " The soldier crowd flowed backwards , tripping in their haste , leaving a circle where a man knelt , gripping another by the throat . " Mother of God , " whispered Catherine . " It is Rhys the Sav-age ! "  |p110I  had never seen either of them before . The man she called Savage was indeed the wildest-looking creature in the world ; one might even believe he belonged to that old race that is said to have occupied the earth before man . He was thick and squat and wore a skin of some wild animal around his middle , and was naked above but hairy . Hair grew down , too , low on his forehead and down his backbone ; his mouth jutted forward , the teeth showing like fangs . He knelt over the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we could see the man was bound and helpless , blood running already down his face ; he was dressed in the jerkin and hose of an English archer . Voices rose all around , and from the yard the women loudest of all . " Kill him ! Kill the Englishpig ! To the fire with him ! " The company sat or stood , frozen , like a scene in a masque , Owen with his hand still upraised . On a sudden , Walter Brut , the Lollard , broke from his place at table and ran to the men on the floor . " My Lord Owen , " he cried , ringingly , " this man has an immortal soul ! He must be heard ! " Rhys the Savage gave a murderous sound , more like a growl than a word , and raised his knife . The voices rose again . " He will not speak ! Throw him into the fire ! " Owen 's voice thundered where he stood . " Rhys Gethin ! Hold ! " And he spoke other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Speak , man ! Where are you from ? " " Speak , speak ! " howled the mob , inside and out the hall . The bound man , loosed by the Savage for a second , struggled a little ways up from the floor . I saw his face clearly , white as chalk , with runnels of blood upon it . " God save King Harry ! " cried the Englishman . " God save Lancaster and to hell with . . . . " but his words ended in a long-drawn death cry , for Rhys the Savage did not hold his hand . There was a hush of horror upon the hall ; then , over the whole assembled crowd came shriek after shriek in a woman 's voice , rending the air . It came from the courtyard outside and went on and on , piteous and wild , until it stopped suddenly , in the middle of a wail , as if sliced by a sword . Again there was silence . Quiet , cool , like drops of rain , fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You shall answer to this blood , Rhys Gethin . In court of law , beast that you are , you shall answer . . . . " He made ap111sign with his hand to the soldiery . " Bind him . . . and take him away . " His voice sounded weary , with the weariness , I thought , for I am fanciful , of an old and sickened god . As they dragged the brutish creature from the hall ; he broke from his captors and ran toward Owen . Oh , my God , I thought , Owen is lost , for he carries no weapon . But this Rhys Gethin flung himself at his feet , grabbing at the hem of Owen 's tunic and kissing it . " Kill me . . . Kill me. . . . " he said in a broken sort of Welsh . " Do what you will with me , Prince . . . but save Wales only ! " " Save Wales ! Save Wales ! " rang through the hall , from a hundredvoices . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the rightfulPrince of Wales ! Saint Derfel for Owen and the Red Dragon ! Owen and Wales ! Owen and Wales forever ! " Owen looked long on the figure at his feet , slobbering at his gown . He stood for a long moment , still as a stone ; then , stooping , he raised him up , kissing the filthy creature on his matted head . " My son , my son . . . poor animal . . . poor , poor creatureof God . . . . " And the tears stood in Prince Owen 's eyes , glittering in the flickering firelight . " Go to your prison , my poor son . . . bear him kindly . . . . " And he made sign to the menat-arms , who took the Savage away . All was confusion in hall . Owen sank down onto his seat on the dais , his head in his hands . The Lady Margaret left his side and , quickly , for all her great size , went to the end of table , where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ear . I saw the other Griffith , the belt of Eliseg still hanging askew about his neck , standing foolishly by his father , struck dumb . The Lollard knelt beside the dead Englishman ; he had torn his fine gown into strips to wipe the face clean of blood and hide the gaping wound in the throat . I saw him take , then , the small cross he wore at his belt and place it between the dead man 's hands , crossed now on his breast . There was a goblet of wine overturned on the floor , and blood and wine mingled , reddening the strewn rushes of the hearth and staining the remnants of Sir Walter 's gown . It was a scene of antique horror ; only Cassandra was missing , though I felt her words within me like a doom  |p112There  was harp-playing all that sad evening , but it was the bard Griffith Lloyd , and not the ancient Iolo Goch , who would not leave his chamber after the violence below stairs . We were all herded to our quarters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meredith carried her up the stairs , handing her to nurse , who cuddled her as if she were a baby ; I think , though , that she was already come around in Meredith 's arms , for I saw a little gleam under her eyelids and a flickering , too . It must be pleasant to be carried so ; I fear , alas , it will never be my fate , though , unlessthe man be a giant , which Meredith is not . We could hear the harping from the hall , haunting and wild ; old dirges , and one new one that the bard improvised , more beautiful than all the rest . We could hear only scattered words though  --  there was so much commotion in our apartments alone . But Griffith , our brother , came to us soon , to tell the news . He is the Lady Margaret 's favorite , one can tell , for we can seldom welcome young men when the lamps are lit . He said that Owen had forbidden any war songs and was trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been closed , and men sent to disperse the folk in the courtyard . Efa was furious that she had missed all the excitement and made us all sick with her blood-greed ; how old was the Englishman , where was he wounded and in which parts , how far did the blood spurt , how far did the knife go in , and so on . Elliw turned quite green and had to be put to bed , shut away behind her curtains and with her canopy over . It is difficult to fathom Efa ; Catherine says she is fey ; privately I think it is worse than that . Why should there not be minds that are ill , as bodies are ? It is a strange thing ; though she is my half-sister , I do not like her . She is the only one of the maidens I have no feeling for ; even Sibli , who is forever trying to fondle me , does not really annoy . One just must avoid her embraces , that is all . Griffith , I said , looked like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long-winded and precise . Meredith had to remind him that hep113was expected to join Owen , with some of the other young men , in the Saracen Room . ( This is simply a large chamber furnished with Eastern treasures , costly carpets , and beautiful , rare wall hangings . ) We have never been there , we girls , for some of the hangings portray scenes which the Argyllwyddes considers too lively for our maidenly senses . Naturally , we have imagined all sorts of things , obscenities , even , but Iago , one of the nicer of the pages , says it is simply a lot of naked women lying about seductively . So that , I conceive , it is much like the books of Eastern workmanship that Catherine and I found in an old sea chest . We both of us thought the women were too fat . Griffith told us that the two holy fathers , who were at hall , have left in a huff because Owen allowed the Englishman 's body to be put into our private chapel ; they argued that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dung heap . Owen did not answer , but gave them escort for the ride back to the cloister . He has made two more enemies , I guess ; some of the clergy call Owen a heathen already , though many and many a night they fill their bellies at his table . I wish , myself , that they would go over to the English ; they are cut of the same cloth as old flamecrazyArundel , anyway . The hall was emptied slowly , and the last strains of the harpingdied on the air . We were all in our shifts and locked in for the night ; Catherine and I shared a bed we were waiting to hear nurse snore , so we could talk . There came a light scratch at the door , and then another , and we heard nurse grumble and the clink of keys . There was no moon , but the ceiling was open to the sky , and by the light of the stars we could see that the serving maids were bringing something in , something like a body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and all over the chamber we could hear rustlings ; no one was asleep . After the maids came the Lady Margaret , with a candle ; in its light we saw her fingers pressed to her lips . " Sh-h-h . . . " she whispered . " It is a very sick woman . . Sick , indeed , she looked , in the flickering light ; I would almost have thought her dead . The twins rose quickly and got other candles to light from the lady 's , and Catherine and I fetched the great rushlight from the mantel . All the maidens were up now , except Elliw , and she was peeping from between her curtains.  |p114The  lady took a wet cloth from one of the serving girls and sponged off the blood from the face ; they had laid her on my bed , which was the only one empty , I having been in Catherine 's . I saw with a certain squeamishness that she was a very dirty wench , besides soaking blood into my coverings . I pushed the thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and held the light for the Lady Margaret . The woman she was really not a great deal older than we , twenty , perhaps had several gashes on her forehead , and a great wound in her arm ; blood kept flowing from it , though the lady had wadded cotton against it . Her clothes were all filthy and mostly torn away ; she looked as though wild dogs had been at her . There was , too , a huge bruise already purpling on one cheek , under her eye . The lady turned to the serving maid , making a gesture . " Quick  --  fetch the Israel-ite ! " " I 'll go ! " cried Efa . " I know where he is . . . he 's with Owen in the Saracen Room . . . . " And she darted out between the serving women , before anyone could stop her , running down the hall in her shift . I saw the lady bite her lips and frown ; Efa would pay for this . It crossed my mind that maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the young men home ; though she has spent most of her days here , Efa is as wild as a fox-bitch from the forest . I stopped thinking about her though , for the girl on the bed began moaning and moving her head from side to side . Her hair , if it had been washed , was pale as flax , long and very straight . It was hard to tell what her face might look like  --  it was so beaten and swollen  --  but her body was very fair , with firm , rounded limbs , and white skin . She was sturdier of build than any of us maidens here but still comely . We heard Efa running back , her bare feet slapping the flags , quick and loud in the quiet house , and behind her the dragging limp of the Israelite . When she slipped in through the door , I saw her face was flushed and near to laughter , her reddish curls all tumbled about her face . Her shift had slipped off one shoulder , too , exposing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Argyllwyddes . But she had not seen and had risen to speak to the physician . He was just coming down the corridor , Nathan ben Arran , Owen 's friend and doctor . Owen had brought him back from one of his Eastern trips long ago ; no one can remember when he was not here in the household . I think that no one yet ,  |p115under  his care , has ever died ; he has great skill , far beyond any of our own people . Catherine and I take lessons from him , too , for we are the cleverest in such things , but we do not study doctoring but just some theory only . He dropped to his knees , quickly for a lame man , and bent his head to the girl 's heart . Then he straightened up and rummaged in his big box , which Iago , the page , had brought , taking out a wound-up length of cloth . This he bound tightly , very tightly , about the girl 's arm , a few inches above the bleeding gash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stop the flow of blood . . . her heartbeat is strong but very rapid . . . . " And he handed Catherine a twist of paper , telling her to empty the powder in it into a little wine . When he put the doctored wine to the girl 's lips , she made a face , though her eyes were closed still ; the stuff must have been bitter . He tipped her head back , forcing the potiondown . " She will sleep now , " he said . " It is poppy juice . . . in a little while she will feel nothing , and I can get to the dressing of this nasty wound . He swabbed around it gently ; she gave a littlemoan . " Not yet . . . who is the maid ? I have not seen her before . . . . " Catherine and I spoke at once , saying that we did not know , that no one knew . The Lady Margaret stopped us , saying , " They found her in the courtyard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the women had beaten her and cut her with knives . . . we think she is from the castle at Ruthin . . . . " " I think she is the woman of that young Englishman " saidEfa , in her important little way ; she was not even in hall but still she knows everything . Perhaps she is a witch . As a matter of fact , this proved to be the case , not Efa being a witch , of course , but the girl being the lover of the dead Englishman . We found all this out later , when she came around and could talk ; it was she whose shrieks we had heard from the courtyard after Rhys the Savage had used his dagger . The girl ( she said she believed she was about eighteen , though she looked somewhat older ) was from the castle at Ruthin , as we had thought . Her name was Alice , and she had the surname Oxerd , in the English fashion , according to the occupation of the family . So this meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone who worked in the stables . This was why she was so dirty , aside from the women having thrown her to the ground.  |p116Anyway  , Alice had followed her man here to Glendower House ; he had been sent to spy , and she feared for him . When she cried out at his death , the women knew that she was English , too , and beat her cruelly , kicking and slashing at her with knives . The men-at-arms had finally dragged them off her , but she looked dead to them , and if the Lollard , Master Brut , had not intervened , she would have been laid on the cold stones beside her dead lover . We did not find this out all at once but in pieces only ; Alice wept continually as soon as she woke from the poppy drug . She was in dread of all of us , too , and screamed if any came near her ; Nathan , the doctor , said she was in a state of shock and rememberednothing . Master Brut said she had miscarried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been about six months inside her . He buriedit just outside our burying ground ; the priests would not allow it in hallowed ground , for that it was English and not shriven either , never having lived . Master Brut says there is nothing in the Scriptures that condemns a babe unborn to the flames of hell , or to limbo either , which is what some of the orders believe . He says all creatures , when they die , rest in the lap of the Saviour , even felons and madmen , even murderers , even the louse cracked betweenour fingers , and not humans only . He says all life is sacred to Jesus ; Master Brut is very religious . We held the funeral services for the dead Englishman , burying him beside the babe . There was no priest who would officiate , so Nathan , the Israelite , read some Hebrew words over him , and Master Brut some Latin . Owen translated into Welsh , and both of the eulogies were very beautiful , especially the Hebrew , which was by an ancient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name , also , strangely enough ; it had to do with green pastures and valleys and the infinite comfort of God . It made me think of our land here , Wales , which we mostly call Cymry , and Catherineand I both wept . The Ruthin girl was still not well and did not attend . She mended slowly , poor thing , her face turning all the shades of the rainbow before it finally looked human again . She is not ill-favored , but I fancy there is a sly , unpleasant look about her ; the Lady Margaret says she has been badly used and is wary of people and surly . Certainly if the stories she tells are true at all , I can not blame her . She says that she was ravished over and overp117again by both the Lord Grey and his son , on her wedding night , so that when her husband had his turn she was near to dead from the rapings , and they could not bed for a week . It is hard to credit , but the Greys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ besides , such things are said to be an English custom , brought over by the Normans . They burned her mother , also , Alice said , for a witch . The strange thing is that Alice said she was a witch and could work evil . She herself boasted that she has learned much of it , too ; Efa is with her a lot , whispering , for she is very curious about such things . Alice is very ignorant , of course , and can not read or write ; as she recovers , the Lady Margaret is having lessons given to her , just sewing and a little spinning , for the moment , but she does well , for a person who has never done anything except tend cattle . The Lollard has asked permission to visit her and read from the Scriptures ; he says it will comfort her for the loss of her man , and the babe , too . She was horrible about the babe and said she did not care if it burned ; she did not know whose it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her by the Grey men . Master Walter spoke gently to her but said such thoughts were wrong , for all creatures have the right alike to immortality . She has come to look forward to his visits , preening herself , and listening to him in all meekness , and she does not with anyone else . Owen says that the teachings of Jesus have always gone down best with the very poor and the ignorant ; that is how , he says , the whole religion started , among the slave population of Rome . Also , he says , it appealed to the barbaric tribes that Rome conqueredhere , in Britain , and in Gaul , and other places , long ago , and so has spread over half the world . But Owen says that so much evil has been wrought over this religion , just like the burningsthat are happening today , which are all on account of some small point of doctrine . He says to look at all the holy wars , the Crusades in Jerusalem , and the devastation there which went on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a smaller way . Just twocenturies ago a whole nation was wiped out and they wereChristians themselves by other Christians ! He means the Albigensians , who had the Cathar religion , just differing a little from the established church , and they were all burned , by the hundreds !  |p118I  asked him if that had not been so , too , with the old pagans , and he said it was lost in the mists of time , but that he did not think so ; they were all much alike , he said , with simple gods drawn from nature , and not much of abstract thought to argue about . Evil has certainly been done , I see that , but the Lollard , for instance , is a true believer in Jesus , and one can see that he is not in any way evil but almost , I think , a saint . Owen says there are many such but doubts that they can weigh very heavily in the scales against the prevailing horror . Owen , though he says these things , is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thinker only . I once heard poor King Richard say that Owen was a man ahead of his times . I believe that Owen would be ahead of whatever times he lived in ; that is the kind of man he is . It is true , though , that religion is the cause of much strife ; even here in the castle there are arguments and shoutings among all the young men , particularly those who have come from Oxford . They are mostly Lollard , but even among themselves they disagree ; they will talk a point until it makes your head swim . Meredithtold me that once , oh , centuries ago , in Paris , where the greatest minds of that time studied , scholars argued for weeks and months over how many angels might dance upon the head of a pin ! It is hard to credit , but some of these discussions around here are just as silly . And all over nothing , as I privately think , for I can not help agreeing with Owen . I do not voice this though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wales , no one would allow us to speak of doctrine . There is a woman in France , Christine de Pisan , who is much respected as a poet thinker , but she is a very orthodox believer and almost a mystic ; I have read her works and do not count them as very much . It is like applauding a dog who has learned to walk on his hind legs or a bird whose clipped tongue can imitate speech . Many of the young Oxford men are extremely rebellious to the new king , spitting and cursing at his name ; most of them , too , are fiercely Welsh , and are all for war with England . There are a few commoners among them , too , those who studied under Owen 's grants , and they want to bring about another peasants ' revolt . There is unrest all about , that is certain , but this castle is a hotbed of seething ideas . Owen does not speak but listens merely , showing courtesy to all. ob.  |p119Every  day the young men visit in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if it is fine , and there have been no skirmishesroundabout ; indeed , since the slaying of the Ruthin spy , there has been little fighting and no reprisals from Lord Grey . I had expected it to be the other way around . The Lady Margaret fears that it is but a calm before the storm . In the meantime , though , we are enjoying ourselves greatly , for it is nearly summer , and green everywhere , with all the little flowers abloom upon the hillsides , and the winding streams leaping down into the valleys . We mostly ride in groups , but there is some pairing off . The twins , Gwynneth and Gwenllian , have found themselves two brothers , imagine it big , laughing boys from Ireland , with flame-red hair cropped around their ears in the new fashion . They are spoiling for a fight , and there is not enough going on in their own country , so they have come to offer their swords to Owen and Wales . I could see Owen 's lip twitch as he heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thanked them most kindly . Many of the young men have their hair cut in this way ; it is a fad started by Harry Percy , he they call Hotspur ; he is the biggest hero in all England , and even though he is allied with their enemy of Lancaster , even the dissenters copy him . In fact , they mostly refuse to believe that he will stay pro-Lancaster , but will come over in time to Owen . I privately do not care very much for the look of this hairstyle ; it is as though a pot were set on the head and scissors cut around the pot edges . Below , all is shaven , just the opposite of the monks ' tonsure . They call it the helm cut , to fit under a helmet easily ; you can see they are all afire to go to war ! Owen , I think , still hopes to avoid it ; the talk is that he has sent peace envoys even to Bolingbroke , but as yet there has been no answer . Meanwhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the high seat , listening but not speaking often . As I have said , there is some pairing off between us young folk ; besides the twins , Catherine has got her Rhisiart , and they go about hand-in-hand when the lady is not watching . No good can come of it , of course , for he is not noble , and she is the only legitimatedaughter of the highest prince of the land . Owen has other daughters by the Argyllwyddes , four of them , but they are muchp120older , children of their youthful days , and all are married off in high places ; I have never met them they are scattered all overWales . Walter Brut spends most of his time with Alice , the Ruthin girl ; he is teaching her his Scriptures , and she has almost lost her sullen look . Indeed , now that she is clean and in seemly dress , she is very fair , in a large , white , Saxon way . She does not ride with us though or go outside the castle ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battles with the Ruthin people . So they two , Alice and the Lollard , sit in corners , talking in whispers of the Bible , and cuddling , too , I suspect . Alice is not a wanton , like Efa , but I have seen the look in her eyes as she gazes at Walter , a look of hunger , truly ; it can not all be greed for knowledge ! As for myself , there are none to my taste here , though I like all my newfound brothers , except Griffith , perhaps ; he is so prim . I know all the names now , of course ; there is David , and Rhys , Tudor , and Evan . They are all for a great war for Wales , and all wear the helm cut , but they are gentle under , one can see . They talk of battles with eyes that are friendly as hounds ! Meredith is still my favorite ; we are much alike , I think , and can talk of anything . He has told me all sorts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for he was at Oxford , too , Harry . Most people call him Hal , says Meredith , and he is much liked , even by those who hate his father well . They studied together , Meredithand Hal , under the famous master of law , Sir John Oldcastle , and much admire this man . This amazes me , for Oldcastle is the most famous Lollard in the whole realm , and Hal 's father so orthodox . But Meredith says that Hal does not agree well with his father anyway and speaks out against the persecutions and burnings , though he , Hal , is not a Lollard either . The strangest thing is that Hal has a name for tumbling all the wenches in the countryside he can not be turned fourteen ! Meredith says Imust not call him little Harry anymore , for he has grown to be a half-head taller than Meredith himself , and I have myself to raise my eyes a little to Meredith . This gives me pleasure to think on , silly though it is , when we are almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our fathers . Even so , when I think of Hal sportingwith all those girls , I feel the blood mount to my face and have to turn my head away so that my brothers will not see . It is most strange.  |p121I  can never forget the night of lolo Goch 's death , for in a way it marked the true start of the war ; also it happened on MidsummerEve , when all the fires were lit all over Wales . The two things go together , as you will see . There had been skirmishes before , and scattered fighting in our northern parts , between Grey 's men and ours , but Owen thought for a long time to avoid a fullscaleconflict . This was not to be . I have said the bard was very ancient ; he had been around so long indeed that one began to think of him as more than mortal . Even Owen , I believe , did not realize that he was dying . He had been ailing since the night in early spring when the Ruthin spy had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but even he could not save him his days were running out . He lived among the house kin , lolo Goch , for he was Owen 's great friend . There was no harping in the hall , even on guest nights , for the music disturbed him strangely ; Griffith Lloyd 's great harp hung on the wall behind him where he sat at meat , and every night he waxed the strings and polished the wood , for it was like a part of him , that harp . We had lit our own fire that Midsummer Eve , on the mound outside the walls . It is an ancient custom , from long before the Christian days , this lighting of the Midsummer fires ; no one can remember exactly what it means . It celebrates the summer and the yield of the earth , I suppose ; Owen says , again , it probably started with sacrifices to propitiate the Mother Goddess , and so is even older than Britain itself . They do not do this firing in Englandmuch nowadays , but Wales is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ridden with superstition . Our fire was burning true , the flames leaping into the air as soon as the late sun went down . We had all come out to watch , the house folk and all the soldiery and company . It is a fine sight , a bonfire , especially when you know that no one suffers in the flames . ( Perhaps that is why they do not observe the custom anymorein English towns . ) The fire was high , right at the top of thep122mound , so that it could be seen for miles around . This mound is not just a hill , but something made by men , long ago . Owen says there are many of them all over Wales ; they date from Druidic times , or before , and are thought to be burying places of the Old People . The Great Mound at Mathrafal was struck by lightning , years ago , when Owen was a boy ; the whole hill was split asunder , and bones were strewn all about . Owen went to see  --  even then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bones were small as children 's and bent in a posture like the child inside the womb . It was a thought that made me shudder , for I could not help thinking of child sacrifice , but Owen says no , the Old People were a smaller race than we are , that is all . The heads of arrows were found , too , at Mathrafal , and broken pieces of pottery , and even jewels , blackened by time . Owen says that meant these folk believed in an afterlife , too , and buried their possessions with them for use in the other world . Owen says often that when he has time he will dig up our mound here , and study what he finds ; it is a pity he does not have nine lives , like a cat , also ! Our fire burned bravely , and we watched for a while , as peoplewill , drawn by the flames ' patterns . We young folk stood on the wall , holding one another for balance , and looked at the horizonfor the other fires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , far away ; we counted nine in all before we went back to hall . It is a lovely moment , that time of the first lighting of the fires of Midsummer ; something full and rare about it the heart seems to burst with rapture , and laughter bubbles in the throat . This was all shattered , though , when we went back indoors , for a strange hush had fallen there , all the company was silent ; two dogs snapped in a corner , fighting over a bit of meat on the floor . Someone shooed them out , and we could hear a strange whistling sound . There was a little knot of people at one end of the hall , bending over something . As we drew near , we saw it was a litter set down on the ground . The bard , Iolo Goch lay on it , his wasted body barely raising the coverings . The whistling sounds were coming from him , as he labored to speak . Owen bent over him like a son , trying to understand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man heaved himself up on his elbows with a mighty effort , straining the musclesin his throat , his eyes staring wildly . He was so tiny and withered , he might himself have been one of the Old People of thep123mounds . His head seemed no bigger than a fist ; it was crowned with a nimbus of white ringlets , soft as cotton . On his upper lip there was a mustache , long and drooping ; the sparse hairs of it were bright red , like copper . Once the hair of his head had been red , too ; it was how he had come by his name , Iolo the Red . We girls had always thought he dyed the hairs of his upper lip , but it could not be , now , on his day of dying . Those thin red hairs , gleaming in the firelight , seemed to draw into them all the life that was left in him , but for the staring eyes and the reedy whistle that came out of his throat . It was plain that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words under the desperate gusty breaths that came out of him . All over the hall the people crept close soldiers , archers , servants , guests , and pages all crowdingaround the dying man . Many fell to their knees . There was the soft sound of women weeping and the harsher sound of the soldiers sobbing ; he was the most beloved figure in these parts . Owen was on his knees now , too , his head close to the old bard 's lips . There was a look of awful strain on his face as he tried to understand the sighing , bubbling breaths , and a terrible flashingof angry impatience in Iolo 's eyes ; over all there was , always , that dreadful , high whistling , louder now . Walter Brut was at Owen 's side , holding a plain wooden cross ; the bard pushed it away angrily ; he was a true heathen , proud and contemptuous , and blasphemous , too , in his time . Walter said to Owen , " Perhaps , sir , the other bard might understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lloyd , who pushed through the crowd and fell to his knees beside the litter ; the big man , bald as a mountain , bent his huge head to kiss one of the knotty , wisened hands of the dying poet ; then he , too , brought his ear close to the old lips . He listened long , while the whole company fell quiet . The ancient bard was louder now , frantic , but the series of sounds were meaningless , the whistle shrilling now in a heartrendingway . Finally Griffith Lloyd straightened up , shaking his head . The poet on the litter made a sign then , gesturing the people back ; there was a listening look on his face . As the crowd fell back , I heard someone whisper , " He is calling on Derfel ! " I heard , too , Walter 's reproving words , " He is praying . . . . " The bard did not seem to hear anything about him ; as I said , hep124looked to be listening to some sound within himself . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big , unnoticed tears running down his face . As we watched , Iolo Goch seemed to relax suddenly , his passionate tension dropping away . He sank back , and Owen knelt to support him . The bard accepted his support with a faint nod , and even something like a smile . For a long moment he lay there , in Owen 's arms , not moving . " Jesus receive him ! " I heard the Lollard murmur softly . I , too , thought the end had come , but the terrible whistling sound continued and the eyes still stared . Suddenly , he made a slight movement , looking , as I thought , toward me . But Elliw , besideme , started forward . I remembered that she was the poet 's kinswoman , on her dead mother 's side , and that she had been raised to the sound of his voice from infancy . He must have been , I thought , trying to get it straight , her great-great-uncle . She , too , bent over the old man , her slight figure bearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she wore white ; her cloudy brown hair was tied back with a ribbon and fell loosely to her waist . I heard her voice , small but clear . " What do you say , Uncle lolo ? Say it again , slower ! Whisper it  --  whisper it , Uncle Iola . . . I can hear you . . . . " And her head bent very close to his lips . Owen raised his hand for silence , but there was no need . The entire hall was silent as death . It was easy to see that this was the great poet 's last chance to be understood . We all held our breaths , waiting . And she did understand him , though how she did it was a mystery . It was , I thought afterward , her instinct in making him whisper , perhaps . I was astonished at Elliw 's calm ; she had always been such a timorous thing , as jumpy as a deer or a rabbit . But this night she sat straight and listened and repeated clearly , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whispered words . I heard a little page somewhere behind me struggling not to cough , and there was a muffled sneeze from the end of the hall , but except for that every word Elliw said fell like a smooth stone into the silence . " He says he willed someone to come , " she said . " Me to come , " she corrected herself . " He says you must all swear on the belt of Eliseg to be Owen 's men against the English . He says September the "  --  she paused then , and we could see her bend lower , frown/ing in concentration , trying to catch the word  --  " September the fifteenth  --  no , the sixteenth  --  the sixteenth . . . you must all come here and proclaim Owen the Prince of Wales . . . . He says on Saint Matthew 's Day we must  --  " She broke off . We could see that the old poet , light as he was , had become too heavy for her as his body slumped against her . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ruthin , " and sank sideways beneath his weight . That word , " Ruthin , " the name of Grey 's stronghold , must have been the last word uttered on earth by Iolo , for he never stirred again , and his staring eyes looked now at the ceiling . Meredith ran forward and gathered up Elliw in his arms , for she had fainted . As he left , carrying her , we could see that the front of her white gown was all marked with Iolo 's blood , where it had gushed from his mouth as he died . I saw the Lady Margaretspeak to Alice , and the girl followed the two to our upstairs chamber . Even in the shock and turmoil of events I found myself marking the Argyllwyddes ' circumspection . Never , never must a maiden be alone with a man where there is a bed nearby ! Owen still stood above the bard , his face all wet with tears , like a statue of grief . He took off his purple short-mantle and , kneeling , laid it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was embroidered on it in gold , and I had the sudden fancy that Wales itself lay there under it , lifeless . There was a little pause ; then from a knot of men Owen 's son Evan came forward , followed by his brothers . He advanced to the foot of the litter . " I swear by the belt of Eliseg  --  " I heard Rhisiart 's voice , sharp and clerkly . " Where is the belt . . . ? " he asked . I thought suddenly , no one had seen it exceptaround Griffith 's neck when we laughed at him that first night . Everyone turned to Griffith , who looked bemused . The Argyllwyddescame close to him , speaking low ; he shook his head . Oh , the booby , I thought , he has lost it ! It was a strange scene , Owen , unmoving , in the midst of all the bustle , silent while the voices rose all about . Suddenly Efa pushed past me . " I know where it is  --  the bard has it ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wall ! " Which bard , I said to myself , and how does she know ? That one is a puzzle , Efa ! But we turned to look at the bard Griffithp126Lloyd , and he nodded ; there were tears , too , on his face . Someoneran for the belt . There was a great surge of motion in the hall , and a sound of many feet , as all the company lined up to take the oath . There were two Cistercian monks here tonight ; they pushed forward importantly , so as to be first . The Cistercians are the most Welsh of all the clergy , and fiercely patriotic . I knew one of them by sight , Father Ambrosius ; I saw that his eyes shone with excitement . There were both of them large , burly men , in rough wadmalhabits , more soldier than churchman . At their girdles they wore short swords ; I saw no sign of bead or crucifix , and their tonsures were growing out , making their heads look very odd . Through all this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hands . He looked down at it , from far away , as if it were a snake he held . Slowly I saw the understanding come into his eyes ; he gave a little sigh as of regret and turned to the waitingcrowd . Briefly he raised the belt aloft ; there was a ragged cheer , and then , very strong , the cry , " Owen , Prince of Wales ! Wales and Owen ! " Father Ambrosius advanced to the foot of what was now the bier , and his deep , rich voice , trained to intone the Latin ritual , rose above the hubbub . " I swear by the Belt of Eliseg to be true man and liege servant to the puissant Prince Owen ap Griffith Fychan as long as my breath shall last ! " The second monk echoed his words , each touching the sacred relic in Owen 's hands . It looked , in truth , a sorry thing , an old rag of leather , moldy and black from all the swearing done already in its name , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , and many even raised it to their lips as they made their vows . The noise in the hall was now so wild that it hurt the ears , but Owen did not raise a hand to quiet it ; he seemed to be in one of his " fits , " as I think of them , where he is not there , but somewhere inside himself . The world flows about him like water around a rock in midstream ; it is strange and chilling but does not last long . I remembered that Rhisiart had asked me about it , saying that it made him shiver to see him so . Just then I heard Rhisiart 's name . Someone shouted , " Make him swear ! Make the little Hereford calf swear . . . make him give a kick at his king ! " I had a glimpse of Rhisiart 's face white with strain . He was liege sub/ject to King Henry , and to swear would be arrant treason and his life forfeit . " Make the damned Lollard swear , Prince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heretic dog takes an honest Christian oath ! " At these words Walter came forward boldly , with a smile . He placed his hand , not on the belt , but on the hilt of Owen 's sword ; the other hand he placed tenderly over the dead man 's heart , as he repeated the words of the oath . At this touch , Owen roused , looking down at the hand on his sword . When he saw who it was , a faint smile crossed his lips . " You , too , Master Brut ? " I had seen before that there was much accord between them . " I swear , too , " said the Lollard , " on the risen Christ , the Saviourof all . " Owen , roused from his trance now , saw Rhisiart where he stood , hesitating . " Make the cousin from Hereford swear ! " the same voice called again . " No need for any of my family to swear , " said Owen , with careless dignity , though most of his sons had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " we may need our cousin to represent us at Lancaster 's court , as he is a lawyer . It would be a mistake to narrow his freedom by oaths and vows . " He finished easily . Then he raised his head , looking all about . " But it would be a great comfort to me , and all my family , too , if everyone here tonight will vow with me , by Our Lady of Valle Crucis and Saint Derfelof Endyrnion , that we will seek the king 's justice for Wales and  --  " He was interrupted by a thunder of voices and a savage clatter of arms , as every hand and every weapon was raised in the air . One voice rose above the others , guttural and wild . " Saint Derfel for Wales ! Saint Derfel for Wales ! " I saw , at the far end , the hairy creature , Rhys Gethin , standing in his chains , and wondered how he had got out of his prison and into hall . But other voices took up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palace seemed to rock and sway to the shout that arose , " Saint Derfel for Wales ! Saint Derfel for Owen Glendower ! Saint Derfel for Owen and Wales ! " Owen stepped lightly up onto a trestle table , raising his handsp128for silence . " And now , " he said , " the Lady Margaret and I have only to tell you that there will be mead and wine in hall till midnight . Griffith Lloyd ap Dafydd ab Einion will sing to you . . . he will sing of the dead and the living  --  of our wrongs and of our hopes . He will sing the glory of Iolo Goch , our dead friend . , . . he will sing of the rise and fall of Dinas Bran . . . He will sing of the great King Eliseg of our house upon whose belt you have sworn . . . . " And as he spoke , there was a movement of relaxationall over the hall , men began to sink to their places by the fire , their weapons clattering softly as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great gate outside being opened , as the guard was relieved . Owen stepped down then ; taking a goblet of wine , he stood over the bier where the dead bard lay , muttering Welsh words low . He took , then , a long drink and , dipping his fingers into the goblet , sprinkled the body . It was some old ritual , I suspect , or maybe some private communication of his own , but it is such doings that give Owen a reputation for trafficking in magic . He made a sign , then , to some servants , to take the body into chapel . He stood there , for a while , sunk in thought , sipping the wine . I saw , sitting alone by the fire , my stepbrother Griffith , staring gloomily into the flames . All about him was excitement and chatter , but he sat on , rubbing first one shin and then another , as he felt the heat scorching him . I felt myself alone , too , for Catherine was at her Rhisiart 's side , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have gone to Griffith , but he made no sign , though he saw me watching , only turned back and went on gazing into the heart of the flames . I felt shy and foreign , suddenly , among all this Welshness ; the singing had started , and the songs of the Cymry fell , haunting and wild , on the air . I would have gone to my chamber , but a touch came on my arm . It was Meredith , and I smiled at him gratefully . " How is Elliw ? " I asked , for I knew he had been with her above-stairs . " She is sleeping soundly now we gave her a potion . . . the whole thing is a great shock to her , of course . . . . " " She is such a little goose , usually " I began . " She is a very brave girl , " Meredith said quietly . Oh-oh , I thought , another love-struck one . But I said no more and pointed to Griffith . " He has not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upstairs , so could not come forward . . . but Father noticed Griffith , I think . " " But Owen said our family need not swear , " I began . " That was the reason before anyone could call shame on hiseldest . . . . Griffith is angry about the oath , I think . He never liked Iolo and thinks Father was bewitched in a way . . . . Griffith has no heart for music or poetry . He thinks the bards are all half mad . " He gave a little smile and looked at me in an impishkind of way . " I daresay he 's right , too . . . . " I nodded , smiling too . " It is the madness of genius , " I said . Meredith went on , more soberly . " Griffith will go along with whatever is decided , but he thinks it 's silly to break with the king just because of Grey . He hates all this Welshness and superstition and oath-taking . . . But Father feels  --  and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 'll be through madmen and bards , through hotheads and firebrands , through Derfelites and patriots , rather than through the counsels of the prudent . . . . Rhisiart had come up then with Catherine , and he broke in eagerly . " But would n't it be wiser to wait ? " he said . " Will Owen really let them proclaim him on September the sixteenth ? What was that all about ? " He looked more than ever like a young eagle , with his dark face flushed and his eyes shining . Meredith obviously did not trust the English part of him , for he brushed the question aside and said merely , with a vague wave of his hand , " Oh , Father will wait for another sign , I suppose . . . . " But I had seen Owen 's face when lolo named the date , and I knew he took it seriously . Rhisiart 's thin lips drew in at Meredith 's withdrawal ; one could almost see his feathers wilt . Catherine , noticing this , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wall and look at the fires . . . . It 's still Midsummer Night . . . . " It had grown a little chill ; there were no stars , and the night was very black . We giggled as we felt for holds in the smooth wall . When we stood on top of it , a strong wind blew in our faces . " It feels as though September had come already , " said Meredith softly in my ear ; I shivered , and he put his arm about my shouldersas we stood staring at the fires . " How many did you count before ? " I whispered softly , watching . " Nine , " he answered , very quiet . I went over them again inp130my head seven , eight , nine  --  and , to the left , a tenth , larger , a wall of flame , blowing in great tongues to the west . Meredith 's arm tightened on my shoulder . " Valle Crucis , " he " said . " It 's Valle Crucis . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned frightened faces toward one another in the dark . " Yes , " Meredith said slowly . " I think September the sixteenthhas come . . . . "  |p131Since  the burning of Valle Crucis , Glendower House has been overflowing with clergy . Some were killed when the English attackedthe monastery , and a few died in the flames , but most of them were saved . Of the nuns , not one remains ; there is no trace of them , so it is believed they were all captured . It is a very wicked thing the English did , for the monastery was without defenses , and all the people were helpless against the marauders . Already , though , they have begun to pay for it . When we sighted the Valle Crucis fire on Midsummer Night , Owen rode swiftly to its defense , with all his sons and a great company of armed followers . No one of our side was wounded , even , but the English suffered great losses , for those that remainedwere taken by surprise . Owen took some captives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They are in the donjon keep , awaiting ransom from old Bolingbroke . I would not be in their shoes , for Owen has asked an enormous sum for them , and everybody knows the stinginess of the new king . Owen will not put them to death , but they do not know that , of course ; it is satisfyingto think of them lying there , underground , in discomfort and terror , after what they have done . I have never been vengefulor bloodthirsty , but jail is too good for these devilish men . Alice goes every day to look through the bars and taunt them , calling them all manner of filthy names . In a way , one can not blame her , seeing how she has suffered at their hands , but it is not the act of a gentlewoman . That she is not , of course , but Waltersays it is not the act of a Christian either . He reproaches her constantly , quoting Scripture , but for once she will not listen . I saw these men , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first morning . One could almost feel sorry for them ; they were in a dreadful state . Covered with mud they were , their clothes all tattered and torn and their armor stripped away ; the older one stumbled as he walked , for blood kept running down i n to his eyes from a great cut on his brow . All the women shouted insults at them , and threw stones and garbage , for they arep132objects of great hate among the peasantry roundabout . They have ever been oppressors of the people , in the English way , but lately they have done worse rapings , as with Alice , and slaughterand plunder , too . Strange , that one can not read their wickednessin their faces ; they just looked wretched and sick and conquered . The father is even well favored , though the son looks somewhat like a frog . Old Grey , I saw , did everything he could to protect his boy , trying to shield him from the women 's blows . It is strange to think of such a monster knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most things that live , even rats . As I said , one can hardly walk about without bumping into a monk , and they are busy throughout the whole place , gathering men to them at corners , and exhorting them in the name of all that is holy to go to war . These same monks call it a Welsh crusade , and the Derfelites want to bring back all the old customs , while the students and Lollards want political and religious freedomand the peasantry want a revolt against all nobility . It is said that more and more students , Lollards , and just discontented serfs are crossing over into Wales , all ready to fight beside Owen . Owen , in the meantime , is playing a waiting game . I think he still hopes for some kind of peace terms from the king . There is a constant stream of visitors : high officials , prophets , and foreign dignitaries . He is closeted away with somebody or the other every night . There have been Frenchmen from the Valoisking , and from Burgundy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France . I do not know much , but Meredith says Owen will not enter into real battle with Bolingbroke without help from France . Personally , I think we are at war already , though Owen will not admit it and will make no move except for reprisals . Last night there was an envoy from the Pope at Rome . ( There are two Popes , one in Avignon , which is really pretty silly , when you come to think of it . ) Anyway , this man , an Italian , very small , and swarthy , and sly-looking , pretended to have an importantmessage for Owen from his master , and all the while , he carriedanother for the usurper Bolingbroke in a pouch beneath his shirt ! One of the pages found it while the man was bathing . Owen was very angry and sent the man on to Bolingbroke , with another demand for the Greys ' ransom , twice again what he had first asked ; the sum , he said , went up with each delay . The sixteenth of September has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Owen was proclaimed Prince of Wales , not only here , but in other places all over Wales . They say there is now no stronghold in the country that is not with Owen , except for Nannau , in the south , where Hywele Sele is lord . This HyweleSele is a near kinsman of Owen 's , too , but he has always been an enemy and pro-Lancaster . No one knows why they are enemies , but it is some old quarrel of their youth ; one can see that Owen hates the man ; it is in his eyes whenever Nannau is mentioned . About a month after the proclamation , in October it was , and the days still beautiful but growing cooler , a great group of us young folk rode out along the road to Mathrafal . Halfway there , there is a beautiful woods , dense with all sorts of growth , the kind of place where you can almost see Arthur and Merlin . I had been there once before , in the spring of the year , but truly it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all the leaves changing color and blazing against the sky . We were all looking forward to it ; we had taken hampers of food and ale and were planning a whole day 's outing . It was a glorious day , diamond-clear , with a little wind from the north whipping into our cheeks and making them tingle . I wore a leather jerkin , dyed green , with a dragon , our arms , embroidered on the front . It is the mate to Catherine 's ; Owen had them made for us when I first came here . There is a shirt under , to match , and hose of a darker hue . There is a picking out of scarlet and gold threads on the dragon , so we are quite gay . All the damsels but Alice are in hose , so that we look like pages , except for our hair , which we wear braided , for neatness while we ride . Catherine , though , is riding amongst all her brothers ; she will not come near to poor Rhisiart . I am sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunched on his mount , an old piebald thing that he has had since he learned to ride . Catherine had come upon him , where he cuddled with Efa in a dark passage abovestairs ; she did not tell the Argyllwyddes , but she will not speak to him either ; Catherine is not forgiving . I have told her that he is not to blame , a man would have to be made of stone when Efa comes rubbing against him ; there is not one , I warrant , that she has not dallied with , including the old minstrels and her own brothers even . But Catherine rides ahead , and Rhisiart is sunk in gloom.  |p134The  road to Mathrafal is straight and smooth as though cut by a knife . It was made by the Romans long ago and has only fallen away in spots here and there . It runs between thickets of trees and bushes , all gold and red , and in places our horses ' feet go ankle-deep in the bright leaves that have fallen already . The birds make a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flown off to their winter homes . We have to look hard to find them though , for they are colored like the leaves ; now and then one flits across under our noses . It is all pretty and magical , the scene , except for Rhisiart sulking . I tried to cheer him , humming an old rhyme that has to do with birds , but the only words I could remember were far from heartening . Surprisingly , though , he raised his head , interest lively in his face . " What is that song ? " he asked . " I had a Welsh nurse . . . she used to sing it to me when I was no higher than her knee " " I have forgot the words , " I said , laughing , " except the part at the end , and it is passing sad . . . . " " Sing it ! " I began softly : " Woe for us ! Woe for us ! The embers are dead. /The Birds of Rhiannon are all flown away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the sword and the wind and the clay ! " A voice joined in behind me , solemn as a dirge , repeating the verse . It was the Lollard , Master Walter , who had ridden up with his Alice . There was a glow on his face as though he listened to an angel ; I am not so good a singer as that , but I held back the merry quip that rose to my lips , watching his countenance . We four , even Alice , who is not any part Welsh , rode in silence for a while , thinking on the old lament . I thought of the fall of the Old Kingdom and the turmoil in modern Wales and shuddered to imagine what might be the outcome of this present conflict . Besideme , Rhisiart said , " A goose has walked over your grave ! " He spoke lightly , and I saw his mood had lifted . " I do not know the saying . . . . " I said . " Oh , it is English . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " It is Latin , too , " said Walter . " I have read something like it in Pliny. "  |p135They  fell to talking of language sources and such , their scholars ' minds kindling . By and by Walter began to point out the birds to Alice , naming their Latin names , and some , too , that have Greek ones . I know enough of both tongues for that , so we all began vying with one another to flaunt our knowledge . Exceptfor Alice , of course , who has no learning . She did not mind though and repeated the words haltingly after us , like a child at its nurse 's knee . We were very merry and lagged along on our mounts , letting them nibble at will among the grasses by the side of the road . I noticed , somewhere in the back of my mind , that all the other riders had passed us , even the men-at-arms who were bringing up the rear . I looked ahead , seeing the road stretching empty before us . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a goodsizedstream ; we could not see over it and had lost sight of our companions . " We ought to catch up " I said , spurring my horse . We allfell silent then and pushed our horses on . The bridge still climbed before us , rounding over the stream , so that we had no sight , still , of those ahead , but I caught a gleam , too bright for water , beneath , and gave a little cry , pointing . A head , helmeted , came into view ; a horseman , mounted and in armor , rode up from the bank of the stream under the bridge . Another followed and another , and then they were upon us , too many to count . " They are of Lancaster ! " cried Rhisiart , wheeling his horse . The poor animal , unused to any sudden move , rose on his hind feet , pawing the air and neighing in terror . All our horses took fright , too , and behaved like unbroken colts . I am a good horsewoman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though I pulled at his head with all my strength . The men surrounded us , their swords drawn . " We are unarmed ! " cried the Lollard . " Would you draw sword on ladies ? " shouted Rhisiart , his Normanface dark red in rage . " This one is no lady " one of the men guffawed , pointing toAlice " it is the Greys ' whore . . . . " At this Alice opened her mouth and screamed shrilly , as she had done that night when Rhys Gethin had slain her lover . I reached over and grabbed her arm , my fingers biting into herp136flesh to quiet her . " Sh-h-h " I hissed into her ear . " We are toofew the others will hear you and ride back , and we will all becaptured , or worse . . . . By now Rhisiart 's horse had stopped thrashing about , and he , too , had forced back his first quick anger . He spoke haughtily , with that high-nosed Norman look that cows all the English . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men-at-arms ! " He looked so imperious that they fell back a little , muttering , parting their ranks . A big , burly man came riding forward then , dressed in light mail , and with his head bare . He drew no sword , and his face had a good-natured look about it , for all he wore the Lancastercolors . " I am Denis Burnell , " he said , " constable of Dinas Bran . I am at your service , Lady Catherine , " he went on , turning to me . I opened my mouth to correct him , but Rhisiart , beside me , gave me such a kick on the ankle that I went pale . I stole a look at him and saw him frown warningly . The man Burnell continued . " I am come to bring you back to the castle , in the king 's name . You must stand as hostages for the Greys till your worthy father sees fit to release them . " There was a hint of irony in his last words , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his courteous attitude . Rhisiart spoke up , still arrogant . " I will stand hostage gladly , and I can speak for Sir Walter too , I trust but Imust beg you to let these ladies go ! It is against the laws of chivalryto hold women . . . . " " They will suffer no hurt , I promise you , " Burnell said with dignity . " But stay they must . . . they will lodge in the Ladies ' Tower , the Lady Catherine and her serving wench . " His words had a final ring , and his face lost its look of good humor . " I am a citizen of Hereford , " said Rhisiart , " and liege subject to King Henry . I am at present acting-secretary to my kinsman , Baron Owen " " I have heard of you , sirrah , " said Denis Burnell shortly . Rhisiartsubsided , with a chastened look . I saw that he suffered embarrassmentbefore me and did not look at him just then . " Permit me to escort you , Lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was the first time I had been addressed as a fully grown gentlewoman ; it flustered me , and I nodded my head , without words . He led the way , back down where he had comep137from . I followed , seeing that the streambed was dry and made , indeed , a passable road , cutting to the west . We did not even have to lower our heads as we passed under the bridge , it rose so high . They put no restraint upon us , letting us ride as we would , so we kept together , talking low among ourselves . There were soldiersall about , before and behind ; it was useless to attempt to free ourselves . Burnell rode some little way ahead , out of earshot . Rhisiart said , looking wise , " Let them think you Catherine ; it will give us better bargaining power . As for me , I shall make much of being close kinsman to Owen " I thought wryly , What difference will any of this make if the English mean mischief ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprisingly , and nodded , " You are right . . . the more value they place upon us , the more care they will take . Me , they will have heard of , no doubt . But , as I have already been acquitted of heresy , they can not , with any fairness , bring me to trial again . It is Alice I fear for  --  " As she made a sudden move , he laid a hand on her arm , saying , " Look  --  I shall say she is my wife , Mistress Brut of Clyde . . . I am a knight ; it will give her standing . Besides , " he went on , " it is what I wish , if she will have me . . . . " I stole a look at Alice ; her face was very white , and there were tears on it ; she was too moved to speak . " Will you have rne , Mistress Alice ? " asked the Lollard , smiling . " It is no great bargain  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She nodded dumbly . " I would be whatever you are , Wat . . . Let them burn me , too ! " He raised her hand to his lips . " So be it then . . . but no talk of burning . The English do not burn women " " My mother , " she said stubbornly , " they burned my mother ! " " Your mother , " he said , with a sweet reasonableness , " your mother was an avowed witch . " And , so saying , he made the sign against the evil eye , the two middle fingers folded in , and the forefinger and little finger held stiffly outward . I was aghast . I have seen the soldiers and the peasants make just such a sign against Walter himself ! Rhisiart had been watching them curiously ; I think he wondered at the Lollard 's choice  --  he has the Norman snobbery . He snapped his fingers suddenly  | " I can marry you ! " he said . " I am a clerk-at-law ! " But then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the two witnesses though . . . . " " No matter , " said Walter . " It is a fine idea . . . we can perhapsfind them there at Dinas Bran . " I could not imagine what he thought to find there , in the enemy camp , but I said nothing and fell to thinking of our plight . None of us spoke for a little : I think we were all a bit afraid ; I know I was . I was surprised to see Walter ride boldly forward to Burnell and seek converse with him . We watched them talking , it seemed quite amiably . Beside me , Rhisiart bit his lip ; he was most likely chagrined that the Lollard had shown so bravely , while he rode along with girls . Walter came back presently , a smile on his face . " They are taking us to Dinas Bran , " he said . Well , we all have surmised that , I thought , a trifle acidly , but I said nothing . " The Percys are there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close to the king , and not unsympathetic to our cause . We may yet thank the heavens for this happenstance . . . we may perhaps be emissaries of peace even . . . . " " Hotspur ! " cried Rhisiart , his dark features lighting up . Ah , I thought , even our little scholar-clerk is not armored against the magic of Hotspur 's fame . He is the idol of all the youth of Britain . " They say the young prince is with him , learning the arts of war , " said Rhisiart . " He , too , has much respect for Owen . . . at Oxford he had many friends among the Welsh . . . . " " Among our Lollard brothers , too , " said Walter . " Oldcastle was his master . . . . " They both brightened visibly , while my heart , unaccountably , began to beat very hard.  |p139The  first sight of Dinas Bran is enough to shake the heart , especiallycoming upon it as the sun waned and seeing it dark and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day of our capture . The castle stands upon a high crag and can be seen for miles around . Even so , none of us had ever glimpsed it , for it had long been an English stronghold . We all four fell silent , gazing at it , and even the rough talk of the border soldiers died down , though perhaps they were just weary . They had , after all , ridden both ways that day . Dinas Bran is the oldest fortress in Wales , getting its name from Bran the Blessed , who lived long , long ago , before written history , and only the old songs tell of him . He was a hero-king , a giant , so it is said . And indeed , the castle looks as though it were flung up by giants in a time beyond thinking on ; even its ruinationseems to have been done by giants , hurling thunderbolts . Its roofline is jagged and savage against the sky , its windows like blinded eyes , red where the setting sun pours through . It broods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since come out of the roadbed of the stream and journeyed along a winding trail beside a tiny brook where late flowers still bloomed among the reeds . The way seemed endless , always the fortress high above us ; it looked inaccessible . I glanced at Rhisiart , beside me ; his face looked gray and exhausted . I saw that it was covered with grime and dust , streaked where he had wiped away the sweat . We must all look like that , I thought , with some dismay , and pulled my linen smallcloth from under my jerkin . The Argyllwyddes made these I think they were her own invention ; they were for spitting into or blowing the nose and were very useful . I had a little flask , too , at my belt , and I tipped some water onto the cloth , and so made shift to wash my face , in a sort , pinching at my cheeks , too , to bring the color up . I saw Rhisiart look at me curiously and offered him the use of what was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throwing back his head , swallowed it down . He handed it back to me , saying , " How do we get upp140there , do you think ? " and squinted at the blazing sky . " It looks deserted , too . . . Do you think they will feed us up there ? " I , too , was hungry ; we had had nothing at midday but some black bread and cheese and a strip of some dried meat , too tough to chew , soldiers ' rations . I thought longingly of the delicate meal we had packed , cold partridge stuffed with herbs , wine , too , and small white loaves fresh from the oven . Surely , they will not starve us , I thought ; we are hostages , after all , not prisoners . But a cold feeling went through me just the same ; who could tell with the English ? There was a soft whimper behind me , and Alice whispered , " Oh , Mistress Morgan , I am sore afeared . . . . " " Hush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulders . " Have courage . We are in the Saviour 's hands . . . and she is the Lady Catherine  --  remember ? And remember , too , you are MistressBrut , wife of Sir Walter Brut of Clyde in Hereford ! " I prayed that she would remember , for her own sake , though , for myself , I did not too much care for this " Catherine " masquerade , though I knew our captors might well honor more Owen 's legitimate heiress . If indeed , they knew anything at all of honor . I felt a little creeping of fear and tried to push it down . I pushed down the thought of Harry , too , telling myself he would have forgottenme for sure , anyway , after all the time that had passed . We had begun the ascent of the hill now ; the road did not wind , as I had imagined it must but went straight upward , a steep incline . I looked again at the massive ruin above ; how , in Derfel 's name , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place ? My back ached as I thought of the poor slaves who must have done it . And I thought , too , of the common folk , still almost enslaved in England , and here , too , if truth were told . Will they gain really if Owen is victorious ? " It 's a real Welsh fortress , " said Rhisiart , looking up . " Built before Edward 's time , probably in the time of Bad John . . . . " I shook my head . " Oh , no , " I said . " It is much older than that , older than the Caesars . . . . " The Lollard said slowly , " Its foundations are older . . . it has been built upon an older site many times rebuilt , perhaps . . . . I have heard that it was first a hill-city , before it was a fortress at all . " All that is hearsay  --  " began Rhisiart hotly , and they werep141off ! By Our Lady , I thought , these fellows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulse of life to them ! I reached behind me and took the reins of Alice 's mount . " Come , Mistress Alice , " I said , " let us climb this together . We shall rehearse our new selves myself a true-born princess , andyou my waiting woman , and a lady-wife ! " And so it came to pass that I rode into the place of my birth , and into the torn pages of Welsh history alike , beside a Saxon byremaid ! There was , at the summit , a huge gate , obviously of recent building , made of some hard wood ; as it swung open I heard a creak of pulleys and knew it was very modern . It was as thick as a man 's body and wide enough for six horses abreast . The passwordsounded like " Owen whoreson , " which did not reassure me . Though the great gate was new , the walls were from some much earlier time , like the rest of the castle ; they , too , had fallen into ruin and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much trouble over this fine new gate when all a challenger need do is storm the walls ? In places , indeed , they were completelyfallen away , and mounds of rubble stood in their place . There were not so many defenders , either , I noted , scarce half again the number who rode with us . It was much darker inside the walls than out , and true to the Lancaster reputation for stinginess , there were very few lanterns or torches , though twilight was upon us , and the sun almost gone . I blinked , and my horse stumbled . " This way , milady , " said Denis Burnell , who had materialized suddenly before me out of the gloom . I followed him , holding Alice 's hand across the backs of our mounts . I felt , rather than saw , that there was grass underfoot ; we must be in the courtyard . It was vast enough to contain hundreds of tents , it seemed , though it was empty now . My eyes grew slowly accustomed to the dimness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , besides having been damaged in battle , had so fallen into neglect that many of the upper chambers had sunk into the courtyard , leaving only the lower rooms ; one had to pick a way through piles of stones and rubble to get to these . Burnellexplained that only the Ladies ' Tower , and some rooms close to the outer wall were habitable ; the great hall , he said , was in use , though accommodations were crude , but the chapel , the library , and the little court were shattered out of all recognition.  |p142As  he pointed them out , I could see , among the heaps of stones , some that still showed their ancient carvings and moldings , barbaricand intricate of design . A light burned in the entrance to the Ladies ' Tower , where he was leading us . As we drew near , I saw it was held by a girl no older than myself but oddly dressed and smelling of some Eastern scent , heavy and pungent . " This is the Lady Catherine and her serving woman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helped us to dismount . " They are to lodge in the tower tonight . . . . " The girl shook her head solemnly . Her eyes were very large , as you will see sometimes on a doe , with that same frightened look . " No coverings , " she said . " Coverings will be sent . " He spoke impatiently . To me , he said , " I will send a page to bring you to the dining hall presently . . . Till then , Catherine ap Glendourdy . . . . " I could not help laughing , as I corrected him . " Ab Owen it is . . . I could not very well be the daughter of two streams ' ! " That is what " Glendower " or " Glendourdy , " as he called it , means in Welsh . As we spoke , I saw that the lamp-bearer crossed herself with her free hand . She beckoned to us then and led the way up the winding stairs . I saw , following her , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let in daylight , had it not been almost dark . But the flame of the lamp she held blew in the gusty drafts and all but went out ; the stones of the stairs were deathly cold , too I could feel them through my leather shoes . I saw then , with a little shock , that the feet of our guide were bare beneath a full skirt of some heavy , dark red stuff . The soles of her feet were dyed the same dull red , and there were twin bracelets around her ankles , gold-colored , and shaped like little snakes . What manner of place is this , I thought and caught myself up , remembering the dim tales of the ladies of this very tower , of whom my own mother had been one . Was I born here , too , in this tower ? We climbed up and up , winding at every step ; it could not have been very high , but I was panting a little at the top , and Alice too ; the rigors of the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , surprisingly large and comfortable , with wall hangings and cushioned seats and fur rugs beneathour feet , lit by rushlights in sconces set into the wall.  |p143I  turned to the strange girl . " Why did you cross yourself just now ! " " Owen , " she said , " Owen  --  you said his name . . . he has the dark magic . . . . " " That 's ridiculous ! " I said . " He 's no more a magician than you are ! " " Oh , " she said , nodding and smiling , " I know a little , too . . . from the Lady . . . . " I saw that her large eyes were stupid really , and her mouth hung open and was too wet . I wondered if she was feeble-minded , seeing that she crossed herself again . " The Lady will want to see you , " she said . " I 'll tell her you 're here . . . . " And she left the place by another door , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is this ? " I wondered aloud . Alice only shrugged ; I think she was reassured by the looks of the place , half-expecting to be put into a cell-keep or worse . I saw a chest with washing things laid out , and a comb and bottles , and above it a mirror hanging . It was made of an old shield , silvered , and curiously wrought ; the design bordering it was a snake motif again , hundreds of little serpents writhing , with forked tongues . It brought to my mind the Medusa monster , who turned men to stone , and for a moment I , too , almost made the cross sign ; then I remembered that Medusa 's hair was made of snakes , and that she was mythical , anyway . I looked in it , seeing myself all nose , for its front was curved to turn aside weapons , but not so bad , otherwise , as I had feared . My hair was coming undone , that was all . I picked up the comb ; it , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came a kicking then , at the door where we had entered , and two young boys , in page 's clothes , came in , their arms laden . The taller carried a large caldron , steaming and smelling of lavender . " Where am I to put it ? " he asked , huffing and puffing . " Where is Angharrad ? " he asked , looking about him . " Is that her name . . . the barefoot one ? " I said , smiling at him . He was a pretty youth , curly-haired , with his shoulders broadening already , though his voice still cracked . " You do n't miss much , do you ? . . . Yes , that 's the one , Angharrad . She waits on the lady . She 's the only girl in the tower . . . till now . " He set the pot in the middle of a fine embroidered rug , where it slopped over , making a dark stain . " You must bep144Catherine . . . the Lady Catherine , that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I am Lawnslot . " He finished proudly . " Oh , " I said , " from Arthur 's time ? " Such cock-robin boys alwaysbring out some mischief in me . " Well , " said he , not abashed , " I am descended from him . . . . And this is Madoc , " he said , gesturing toward his companion . " A good name , too , " I said , " though not of such ancient line-age . " A look of sweet bafflement crossed his face ; I saw it was no use teasing him , so I said , " This is my waiting woman , a lady of Clyde , Mistress Alice " " Oh , we know who she is ! Grey 's " At my look , he said hastily , " Oh , we wo n't tell  --  we are Owen 's men . " Which made me want to smile again , but I kept my face straight and said only , " How did you know ? " " Well , it is simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows the Argyllwyddes took her to live among the daughters , and she could not be any of them . . . . " The little one spoke then ; he , too , had set down his burden of bedding next to the water . " We are going to run away and join Owen 's army . . . we have already stolen the swords ! " He could not have been , I thought , more than ten . " But who are you ? Do you live here in Dinas Bran ? " " We are the sons of some nuns that used to live here , " the older boy said . " They broke their vows and ran away with some soldiers , so the Lady kept us here , to live among the sisters . . . . They have all run away by now , except for Angharrad . " " Angharrad , too , is a nun ? " I asked , looking skeptical . " Well . . . in a way . It is a very ancient order . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought ; you have it somewhat garbled . But I said nothing , except , " Who is the Lady ? " " Oh , " said the young one , in his light , childish voice . " She is old , so old . . . a hundred , maybe . . . . " " She is the Lady , " said the other . " That 's what everyone calls her . . . she is the " he lowered his voice  --  " she is the high priestess . She has always been here . . . . " Always . I thought , wondering , thinking of my mother . But the boy Lawnslot went on ; he was one of those , I learned , who never stop . " They have given you Myfanwy 's Bower , I see , " he said , nodding sagely . " Right below this window is where they staked him out , her bard lover , night after night , forcing her to watch . . . . They say , at midnight , when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his cries still . " " Then I am glad the moon is dark , " I said sharply . " There is another ghost , too , " said the little Madoc , and his face was alive with interest . " The Hanging Lady . . . right there she hanged herself , after Owen left her . . . . " And he pointed to a beam in the ceiling , where , true enough , a great spikenail protruded . " The Lady Lowry , that was , before my time , " put in the other , talking one . " Mad with grief they say she was . She did it with Myfanwy 's belt . It broke , but she died anyway . " A shiver went through me , for it was my mother he spoke of . I do not credit ghosts , but I knew in the dark my mind would see her there , above me , long and limp , toes pointed to the floor . I resolved to keep a light burning all night , just in case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked Lawnslot . " The water willbe getting cold , and it was monstrous heavy to carry , all this way . " " I am not in the habit of washing in public , " I said pointedly . " Oh , " he said , unabashed , " we will sit on the steps outside . . . though Angharrad lets us watch . . . she does n't do it very often , though . . . . " I held the door open as they passed through and closed it behind the two boys , catching Alice 's eye and laughing . " It is a strange household , for sure , mistress , " she said . We were trying to guess a way to pour from the heavy can into some smaller bowl , that we might wash each in her own private water-store , when Angharrad came back , still bearing her lamp , to lead us to the lady of the tower . I saw she had need of that light , for there were none lit in the corridors where we went . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from those cold walls , rotten and sweetish . At the end of the first passage was a heavy door ; it took all three of us to pull it open , and I wondered how she managed it alone at other times . Clearly the way was known to her . As the door swung shut , it gave a sighing , sobbing sound , which echoed all up and down as we proceeded . Alice pushed close to me and I felt her tremble . I am not such a strong creaturemyself , but , being a gentlewoman , I had to bear myself with the look , at least , of courage . She could not see me , so I took herp146hand firmly and said , " That echo should be seen to . . . windows ought to be cut , too . The air is foul . " Angharrad turned , the whites of her eyes in the feeble lamplightglowing like marsh-fire . " Oh , no , " she said , " no echo . It is Myfanwy sobbing . " We waited a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as echoes do . Truly the poor girl was ignorant . We came to another door , as heavy as the first ; it opened onto a chamber that must have been the mate to the one where we had been lodged , Myfanwy 's , for it too was circular ; the passage must have connected double towers , probably above some ruined hall . The room we entered , though , was very warm , stifling , and reeked of incense like a church on a saint 's day . Indeed , though it was dim , I could make out several holy images : a Jesus , hanging , his features contorted with agony , the running blood looking as though it had been painted yesterday and still wet ; a Saint Benedictbristling with arrows , carved by the same rude hand ; and a delicate and graceful figure of the Virgin , of some Eastern workmanship , her robe picked out in gold . There was Derfel , too , on his horse , with his Derfel-bride flung over his saddle , painted on a cloth which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian knight , except for his horned helmet . I could not see the Lady of the tower at first ; she sat as still as any of her images . She was on a low divan , swathed around and around with draperies of that same dull red stuff the girl wore , shapeless as a bundle ; her head , too , was covered in an old-fashionedwimple , but I could see by her face that she was very old , as old as the ancient bard , lolo Goch , had been , perhaps . She was all wrinkles , and her eyes had a blue film over them . She stretched out a skinny hand , like a bird claw , and fastened it on my wrist , drawing me to her . " I can not see well , child  --  come closer . . . . " She spoke in Old Welsh , so that I missed some of her words , but her voice was surprisinglyfull and rich , with a music in it . She brought up her hand and touched my face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memorize them ; her touch was dry and cool , mortal . " It is the Owen-face . . . a sun-child . . . all the moon-girls are dead and gone . . . long gone . . . . " Her voice rose in a sort of wail ; I knew then she was mad with the weight of her years and wandering in her wits , and a pity crawled in me . " Yes . . . you are his daughter . . my daugh/ters he has driven away , yes , and granddaughters , too . . . . Prince Owen . . . but men must go where the fates lead them . . . . " She took her old hand away then and bowed her head onto her chest . She stayed thus for a long while , it seemed . I heard Angharrad whisper , " She is looking into the future . . . she is seeing your future . . . . " I stirred uneasily , the hair crawling on my scalp as I watched that still figure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the old one did not raise her head ; it had a hollow sound . " The English one I can not see . . . flames only I see . . . flames . . . but the Owen-child will know pain . . . and sorrow too deep for tears . . . and the bright wings of love . . . and ruin . . . Owen will bring you to ruin . . . . " I knew it for the gibberishof the addled , but still a cold wind touched me in that heated chamber . I wanted to leave that presence , but there was a numbnesson me and I stared still . She was silent then for a time ; presentlyher body began to shudder , and low , sobbing breaths came from her . She lifted her head , looking at me as though her filmed old eyes could see , and said , " Go now , Owen 's daughter , and all the saints walk with you ! " She cackled suddenly , like the crone that she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is all that they have left me . . . Lord Griffith made Christians of us , and there are no good gods left and no goddesses either . . . and Owen broke all my altars even and took my daughters . . . . Only Angharradis left a good girl but without the wit to remember a littleprayer . . . go , go all of you . . . . " And she waved her handat us in vague dismissal . As we left , I saw that her head had sunk again onto her breast . We traversed again that dark passage behind Angharrad 's lamp ; cold as the grave it was after that hot and fetid chamber , and echoing its soft sighs behind us . When we reached the Myfanwyroom , I saw that Alice was deathly pale , her forehead beaded with sweat . She moved close to me , whispering , " Oh , mistress , she saw flames for me ! Like my mother " " Hush , " I said , " you are no witch . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to occupy her , and no thoughts at all , and lonely . . . . " " Oh , no , mistress  --  she has the second sight for true . . . her eyes were all covered with cataracts , and yet she knew I was there . . . . "  | " Do n't be foolish , " I said , briskly , " Angharrad will have told her of us , of course . " And I took up the comb and brought it crackling through my hair , though I saw in the mirror that my eyes had a look of fright.  |p149The  great hall of Dinas Bran had fallen into so ruinous a state that if it had been raining , it could not have been used at all . There were great jagged holes in its roof , and indeed I saw severalwild birds flying about among the stone arches high overhead . The one advantage was that the huge clouds of smoke could find their way out without choking everyone to death ; there were many fires burning and no chimneys , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their drunken heads down among puddles of wine , and there was no smell of roasting meats ; along one whole side of the hall the tables had been fastened back to the wall ( they were the old-fashioned kind that hung when not in use ) and the trestles taken away . Holy Mother , I said to myself , we are not to be fed I was quite empty now , almostsick from it , and from my apprehension . I was still in my hose and Alice in her riding dress when Lawnslotfetched us ; there were beautiful clothes from a century ago in the press above-stairs , but they were unaired and smelled of must and that same Eastern scent that hung about the Ladies ' Tower . Angharrad did not come to the hall with us ; Lawnslot whispered that she never left the tower . I caught sight of Rhisiart and Walter standing irresolutely in another doorway and hurried joyfully toward them . There was much noise and confusion ; I could hear a lute playing softly under . There was not much more light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls and disappeared into the pitch-black upper reaches . I saw that Rhisiart was scowling . " No one has come to give us greeting , " he said . " And the soldiers are all drunken and filthy . . . no servants about " " And no food , either , it seems , " said I.A voice spoke , at my elbow ; in the darkness I almost jumped . It was Constable Burnell . " They are setting up a clean table for you over there , " he said , pointing . " The dogs are finishing thep150last of the venison , but there is partridge and a good hare pasty . . . Lord Percy himself has gone to see to your torches . " True to his word , I saw soldiers carrying in a fresh-scrubbed table and two long benches , and setting them up against a dark far wall . Another set two torches in their sconces , and by the light I saw the wall was hung with a tattered and faded hanging ; it looked like a scene of ancient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and long spears . The scowl had not left Rhisiart 's face . " Lord Constable , " he said , " I must protest for the lady . . . for my cousin Catherine  --  " And he lowered his voice . " There are whores here . . . . " " Quite right , sir , " said another voice , " quite right . . . and I agree it is an insult but I fear my men would revolt if I sentthem away . . . . The soldiers have been long away from home . . . . " I turned to see a squarish man in a loose-fitting furred surcoat . He had the blackest eyes I ever saw , and the whitest linen . His shirt was carelessly worn , open at the throat , and the laces dangling , but it was dazzlingly clean . His cheeks , too , looked fresh-barbered , the shaven skin beneath his helm cut showing pale against his weathered neck . His had a blunt , cleft chin , and his nose was flattened from some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a speaking charm . Indeed , the whole man shed a kind of glow about him like a fire . This , I thought , could be no other than the fabled Hotspur , the Lord Percy , even as I heard Burnell pronounce his name . It was easy to see how he had beglamored the youth of a nation . " I give you greeting , Catherine ab Owen . . . . " He smiled into my eyes , for we were of a height ; I had thought he would be a tall man . His voice had the soft burr of the North Country and something else , some hesitation or impediment that gave earnestnessto his speech . I was myself beglamored , for though he was a man of many flaws even his teeth all crooked yet I warmed tohim as if he were a very Apollo . I saw Rhisiart go red , too , with pleasure , as the great warrior shook his head . " Will you be seated , Lady Catherine ? " And he led me to the bench against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the Percys thought themselves finer than kings . This was a flaw I could not like , for it is not the way of the truly royal , and bespeaks ignorance to boot . But Walter drew Alice apart , whispering fondly into her ear.  |p151The  fowl was brought , and a pasty , and good white bread , only a little stale , and wine and beer , too . We ate like starving peasants , only nodding as the Percy pointed out this one or that . He sat across the board , toying with a goblet of pale wine , looking out over the company . " That is a kinsman of yours , I believe  --  " He indicated a burly , redheaded man in his middle years , in light mail . " Hywele Sele . . . but he is not for Owen he flies the Lancasterflag . . . . " I looked at the man closely then , remembering that this was Owen 's avowed enemy . He seemed intent on a little game of his own ; at his feet a soldier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long goose feather to the man 's nose , gently twitching it back and forth . At each touch of the feather , the soldiersneezed but did not wake , which sent his tormenter into spasms of raucous laughter . It seemed a childish occupation to me , but I suppose he , too , was drunk . In truth , most of the hall seemed the worse for the free-flowing mead , and many snored , insensible . I was curious , too , about the whores , for I had never seen any . They did not look much different , that I could see , from court ladies , except that their heads were uncovered and their gowns , for the most part , made of shoddier stuff . But they , too , had the new fashion of shaven eyebrows and hairline ; I have always thought it a strange , bald look . They were thickly painted , too ; one could see it clear across the room . One had a head of black hair reaching to her waist , crimped from the irons ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was seated on somebody 's lap ; it must have been the lute player we had heard earlier , for we saw the fellow dribble what was left in his goblet down her bosom and tumble her off onto the floor . She only smiled , though , and blew a kiss to him as he took up his lute and began to finger it idly . " The prince will want to greet you , lady , " said Hotspur , rising and making his way to the lutist . So there was little Harry ! I had not known him , of course , from the distance , and his back was toward us , too . Hotspur bent to his ear and spoke . He looked toward us , and then back to the girl on the floor at his feet , who was just pulling herself up , holding onto the table ; I saw with a little surprise that she was drunk , too . I had never seen a woman so . Still seated , Harry gave her a playful kick in the rear , whichp152nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; I stole a look at Rhisiart beside me and saw that his Norman face was set hard , like a rock . Walter reached over , touching his arm . " Gently , lad , " he said , with a smile , " it is only a camp-follower . . . . " Harry was coming toward us now with Hotspur . I let out my breath , which I had been holding , as I saw that he walked easily and in a straight line . I do not know why , but I could not have borne it if he had been like all the rest . I watched him , marveling ; he was more of a man , at fourteen , than any of my brothers , though slenderly made . He had none of the colt about him but moved with a quick compact grace ; as he came closer I saw the little Harry again , the long face , leaning a little to one side , the skin clear and pale , a fine , smooth brow . But three years had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , had aged to womanhood . He looked at me full , and I saw something leap behind his eyes . I rose , all confused , and made a low court bow , my head down . I heard Hotspur , " The Lady Catherine ab Owen , Baron Glendower 's daughter . . . His Highness , Henry of Lancaster and Monmouth , the Prince of Wales . . . . " Harry took my hand , raising me up , and drawing me a little apart , speaking low , " You are not Catherine , though , sweet-heart " " And you are not the Prince of Wales , " I hissed under my breath , " for my father is ! " " Touch &"; he said , smiling , and clapping a hand to his heart ; it was a term from the new art of fencing . His French was still poor though , and I told him so . " Do they have no tutors at all at Bolingbroke 's court ? " " That 's my Morgan ! " he whispered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Come , sit apart with me and talk a little . . . it has been so long . . . . " " You have not forgot me then ? " I asked . " How could I ? You are the first girl I ever kissed . . . . " " But not the last , I wager ! " I spoke a little sharply ; I had forgotthat he was heir to England , if unlawfully , and that I was hostage in the enemy camp . " You were the sweetest though . . . " I felt his breath against my cheek , stirring the hair , and blushed ; I did not know where to look.  | " You were not dressed so when I last saw you , " he said , looking down at my legs in their hose . " It is my riding gear . . . all of us dress this way all of themaidens of Owen 's house  --  " " But not the Saxon heifer ? " he said , with a glance toward Alice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I had thought you had eyes only for me . . . . " " I notice all women . . . but she is a heifer . " He thought to please the woman in me , but I had tired of the game . " She is a poor girl , much abused , that we brought back to life , " I said . " I know her story . " He said it shortly , annoyed . " That you do not , sirrah ! " I answered angrily , and rose . " Or the wrong side of it only " He caught my hand , holding it hard . " Let go of me , little Harry ! " I saw his eyes change , but he did not loose his grip . I was all red from the neck up ; I have that kind of skin . All the eyes were on me , too , from the rest of the table , though they could not hear our words . " I am not so little anymore , " Harry said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would you shame me before them all ? " " You are master here , " I said gracelessly , and sat again . He gave a short laugh . " I am not master anywhere . . . but I am sorry I offended you . . . . " " And I am sorry , too , for my anger  --  " " Yet how do you know " and he spoke with a sweet reasonableness " howdo you know the girl 's story is the true one ? " " It can not be otherwise , " I said . " All Wales knows the Ruthin men are brutes . " " All the peasantry of Wales , perhaps . . . you champion them , like Owen . . . They say your father 's followers are armed with pick and shovel  --  " " Maybe you will find it otherwise when first you come to face him , " I answered , quiet now . " Maybe , " he said , with that same mildness . " I faced him once at Richard 's table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought himthen more god than man . . . . " His face was shut in thought . Hespoke again , slowly . " It is not such a bad thing to be , I think  |p154the  commons ' champion . . . my father feels otherwise  --  he has cast his lot with other dice . . . . " We were silent then , for a little . I looked down at the board , feeling his stare , tracing with my finger some initials cut in the wood and a lopsided heart , black with age . He spoke , still looking at me . " Is she so very like you , then . . . Catherine ? " " Not to mistake us , no , " I answered . " We were dressed alike . . . and she had ridden on ahead . . . No , we resemble Owen , both , but she is fairer of hair , and I am taller . It was our cousin Rhisiart who thought up this playact  --  I do not much relish it , myself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " They will let us be together now . . . there is talk of my father asking Catherine 's hand for me . . . . " I felt my heart give a great leap , and my breath came short . " It would make for peace . . . " I said , not trusting myself to say more . " I would not wish it , " he said , " except if she be your twin in all things . . . . " I glanced sharply at him , fearing to see his lips curving in that mocking way they had done earlier , but he was grave , and not even looking at me but into space . Almost one might have thought him sad . " They have been busy already on my behalf , my father 's advisers . . . so far none will have me . The first they asked for was Richard 's Isabelle . . . he was not two weeks in his grave . They had hoped , with it , to sweeten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead . . . . " " Exile " I said . " Where is she then ? " " She is in Scotland  --  well , and safe , I hope . . . . They tell me nothing . . . . " I sensed the hurt child and more , under his words , and put out my hand to touch his . " Oh , Harry . . . " I whispered . " It is true , " he said . " The whole country knew of Richard 's death before I had any word  --  and I asked for him every day . . . he was my friend . . . . " " I know . . . . " " After  --  it was many nights before I slept . . . and even then , my dreams  --  " He broke off ; control sat on his face like a mask , ugly to see on one so young . I thought then that all of his aging had been done in one short span of time.  | " You think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not wanting to finish . He looked full into my eyes . " I do not know what to think . . . my father speaks shortly to me , if at all . And even if I dared ask him , I fear the answer . Humphrey said he was a boy at Richard'scourt  --  " " I remember him , " I said softly . " He said that all kings wade knee-deep in blood . . . . " " It seems to me that all men do , also " I said , thinking to easehim , and remembering all the wars and crusades that have gone on time out of mind , and the private killings , too . He looked at me strangely , and I saw he did not take my meaning . " I had rather the clean blood of battle . . . " he said . His statement had the taint , to my ears , of old piety , and I said so . " It is still blood , " I said , " and men die from its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't quarrel with me over words . . . . " He took my hand , and his face changed , losing its look of gravity . " You are too beautiful for that . . . and then , too , women always hate wars , while men love fighting  --  it is the way of the world . " " It is a way that should be changed , " I said hotly . " And we are not man and woman either , but boy and girl only with privatethoughts , still  --  and not yet set in a mold . . . . " " You are right , Morgan , " he said mildly . " I am surprised sometimes when I think how few years I have . . . I seem to have lived so long . . . . " His face , with its long sweetness , was very sad then , and the woman 's heart in me melted all at once ; it was there , after all , no matter how much I denied it . I think now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know it . I have forgotten what else we said then . I know we talked a while still , apart from the others , and that later we joined them . Rhisiart was surly and looked at me in a way I did not like . I saw he had no love for the prince , or some jealousy , perhaps ; Rhisiart has no feel for class , or , rather , he thinks himself at the top of all society in spite of his low birth . It would be a good trait if he admitted all men to be somewhat equal , which he does not . Also , he acted in a proprietary way toward me , as though in truth I were his Catherine . As if I could stop the prince 's attentions , in any case ! Walter Brut , on the other hand , showed much respect and admiration for Harry , drawing him out and even hanging on his words . He hoped , I think , to win him to the Lollard side . Thep156prince had been present at his heresy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though , thinks Lollardy is for the elect only , not for the commons , treating it as a separation of doctrinal thought , whereas Walter wants the New Learning , as he calls it , to be the sustenance and hope of the lowly . Harry , though , is horrifiedat the burnings and would like to see Arundel out of power . He would have his father appoint his Beaufort cousin , another Henry , to Arundel 's post , and said so openly , though Hotspur frowned . Hotspur is , one can see , his guardian , here in the Welsh Marches , though a lenient one . He has a son just Harry 's age but does not treat him like one , but like a young companion-at-arms . One can see that the prince adores him and looks up to him in all things . The prince played for us , too , on his lute . ( There were no bards , or minstrels , either , with their forces a thing that seemed strange to me . ) And he played more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things he turns his hand to . He would not sing though  --  he said he had no voice  --  but the Percy did , and gladly . I thought privately that he , too , had no voice , being accustomed to those great singers who take their living from it . But he sang pleasantly , carrying the tunes and putting us all in a light mood . Harry struck up a sweet air , new to me , called " Greensleeves . " It was in compliment to me , he said , for I wore green , but Hotspurstopped him , saying it was a song for a light woman . Harry answered that so many love songs were but changed the tune . " This one , " he said , " is the loveliest of all , written by Master Abelard to Heloise . . . she was no light-of-love , for they both took holy orders later . . . . " It was lovely indeed , and in my ear , softly , Harry sang it too . I remember it still , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come death unrelenting . . . with quiet breath consenting . . . I go forth unrepenting . . . Content , content , content . . . that ever such delight were to me lent . . . . "  |p157I  never heard Myfanwy sob again , for we were not resummonedto that strange presence in the other tower room , nor was I troubled by visions of the " hanging lady " in the night . I slept soundly , fatigued by the long ride and by the late supper and the wine . I did not even dream of Harry , though I fell asleep on thoughts of him . Hotspur , after informing me next day that he was sending envoysto Owen to treat of our ransoming , disappeared . Harry said there was good hunting in the woods around those parts , and he was an active man , Hotspur . He was gone most of the day . We young people  --  Harry , too  --  were left to our own devices ; it was a day I remembered long among the barren years that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose Rhisiart but lose him we did for the best part of the morning . ( Later , Rhisiart was to confessthat he looked to protect my virtue , knowing the prince 's reputation ! ) We walked about the ruined walls of the old fortress ; struck with a still magic they were in the early sunlight of that October . We sat for a while on a marble bench that must have been Roman , till its chill struck through to us , and we must walk again , and we talked . He told me sweet secret things of his childhoodat Monmouth , which he loved and still longed for ; I told him of my life , too , as mixed up as his own . He only half-believed the story of my mother and the priestess cult ; I could see he thought it another of the tales cut out of whole cloth that went around constantly about Owen . He showed much interest , though , in the French court , the Queen Isabeau and the little princesses , dirty and wild as street urchins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the king . I was only repeating stories I had heard really , and some small dim memories , for I had been five when I left in Isabelle 's train for the English court . I said , though , to tease him , " There are more princesses left for you , Harry , if Isabelle would not have you . They were very dirty , though their hair curled naturally , a wonder to behold . . . in fact , my father 's spies say there is yet another born only this year ,  |p158called  Katharine , like my sister  --  though they spell it with a k . . . it may be her hair will curl , too . . . . " " I want no princesses , " he said , bringing a piece of my hair to his lips , " though her hair be ever so curling . Yours is beautiful  --  straight as rain and amber-colored in the sun . . . . " Later the others came out to join us , with the two little pages , Lawnslot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prince and followed him about like puppies . The littlest one , Madoc , sidled up to me and whispered , " Lady , we are still for Owen never fear ! It is just that they name him the prince the finest jousterin the realm and he so young ! He has unseated Hotspur even ! " And Lawnslot , too , whispered eagerly , " For tennis , too , they call him a wonder . We have nets and balls within  --  but 1 fear there is no match here for him . . . . " " Do you hear , Harry ? " I said . " You are a tennis champion , it seems ! I know something of the game , though I am a girl . Will you play me ? " " We have no rackets though , " said the little one , his face falling . " Never mind , " said Harry , laughing . " I have three in my luggage pack . It is a present my father always remembers to send . . . Sometimes I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play at balls . . . . I have had one each saint 's day since I was seven , even when they came late . I will play you , " he said to me , " but I warn you , I will win . . . . " " Do not be too sure of that , " I answered . I was wild and light that day , as though wine ran in my veins . He was right though ; I am a good player , but I was no match for him . When it was over I was beaten roundly and sank to the ground , panting . " You are good , though , for a girl , " Harry said handsomely . " Though never have I played a girl before . Girls do not play tennisin England . " " This is not England , " I said sharply , " however much your fatherseeks to make it so . . . . " He sank down , too , then , beside me on the grass and said , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , where my mother lies , there are flowers growing . . . it is a little garden only , planted by my mother 's hands , long ago , when she was alive . There is a rose there , deep yellow , and amber at its heart . . . . Itp159was so beautiful ; when I was very small , I reached out to pluck it from its stem . I have a scar still , here on my palm . . . . " " All roses have thorns  --  " I said , but hanging my head . " Let us invent one that does not , " he said , softly , for my ear only . " We are not enemies , my Morgan . . . and I did not plot out my father 's ways . . . . We were silent then for a little , watching the others . Rhisiart and Walter were playing , the Lollard like some of the girls at home , serving the ball with an underhand thrust , though he was quick to return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as though upon it life depended . He was almost good enough for Harry , but not quite . As we watched , the Percy rode through the gates , a huge deer slung over his mount . He sent it away with his man-at-arms and , throwing off his mantle , flung himself down beside us . " You will play me , my Lord ! " cried Harry . " You have promisednow for months and the net is all set up . . . you can not re-fuse ! " " Ah , " said Hotspur , lying back upon the grass , " what stakes will you put up  --  I do not play for no gain . . . . " " What you will , " said Harry , his eyes shining . " I will pay you when next I have my allowance  --  if it be that I lose , that " Get along with you , lad you 'll never see such . . . no morethan the rest of us do  --  " He finished under his breath . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am winded from the hunt . . . . " " Oh , please , Hotspur " Harry chewed his lip , thinking . " Iwill put up Mercury against your silver gauntlets if I win ! " " Your new black charger ? What will you do for a horse then ? " " I will ride the old roan  --  but I will not lose . . . . " Several of the soldiers came over to watch when they saw Hotspurtake up racket , for he had much skill and was beloved of his men besides . He played in a careless fashion at first , not taking off his surcoat , thinking to win easily . After a while , he saw he was held and began to press harder , raking the court with short , fierce strokes . Harry could not match his strength or the hard spin he put upon the ball . Hotspur won the first set , and they stood for a moment , resting . I went up to Harry and said , " He has you the way he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the far side . . . he is not over-tall . " Harry saw it was sense and aimed his drives high so that Hotspurhad to jump for them , and his own strikes began to fall short . He grew angry and red and at last took off his surcoat , throwing it hard to the sidelines . I could see that he feared he might be shamed by a boy , with all his men watching , for by now a crowd had come up to lay bets . Harry won the next set , making all even , and the last set they played as grimly as if it were a battle . Hotspur 's face was reddening now almost to purple , though his shots were true , but Harry was white and spent-looking . The Percy 's last shot was just inside , a tricky return , and everyone cheered . Harry returned it though , smashing it to the court behindHotspur . I thought it fell inside , and the page Lawnslot , mad with excitement , screamed , " My lord the prince has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are you blind , boy ? It fell outside . " " My Lord , " said Lawnslot staunchly , " I thought it fell true . " " It did not ! " shouted Hotspur . " There is a shadow on the court it moved in the wind . . . . " The prince walked over to Hotspur ; I could see he was tired almost to falling . " I will have my groom bring Mercury to your stall . . . . " The Percy was amiable now that he had won , putting an arm about Harry 's shoulders . " I thought for a moment that you had me , " he said . " It was as close as ever anyone has come . . . . " " I will win one day , " said Harry , smiling but serious under . Most of the castle was there by now , and I heard Denis Burnell say , speaking to Hotspur , " He put up a good fight to the last . . . surely you do not mean to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played for , " said the Percy . The prince , beside me , touched my elbow . " Come with me to the stables  --  I want to take my farewell . . . " " Your horse ? " I asked . He looked shy , suddenly . " I have a great love for animals . . . . " I saw that he breathed heavily still , and myself went slowly , as if it pleased me to do so . He laughed . " I am not so worn by this small conflict as that . It is true my chest pains me at times . . . . They say it is the fever I took as a child , and that I will outgrow it . . . . But it has passed now we can go at a more likely pace . "  |p161The  horse was a great , shining black creature , a noble beast . I could see it would be hard to part with him . Myself , I have never had such a horse ; my own little mare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stabled , but he did not know . He took from his pocket two lumps of sugar , giving one to me ; I saw he was a boy still , in truth , with his pockets full of all manner of oddments , for some marbles fell out , too , and an old , petrified beetle skeleton . When he had fed the horse , I held up my palm with the sugar on it . The charger took it delicately , its wide lips like velvet against my skin . He pawed the floor of his stall after and bowed his beautiful head , acknowledging the gift . I laughed aloud , delighted . " You like him ? " asked Harry , all aglow , looking at me . " A pity he is no longer mine  --  I would have given him to you for a love token . . . . " " That you would not ! " I cried , shaking my head . " Only  --  now I will never know " " I would have given him . . . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . Your face goes all up at the corners as if someone pulled the strings . " I laughed again ; it was so absurd . " Walk with me a little  --  here in the soft dark , " he whispered . In truth the stable was a sweet place in a way , warm and shadowy , smelling of hay and horse , with little rustlings and whisperingsof leather and hides , and now and then a low horse snuffle or a high whinny , more like a sigh . There was a shaft of outside light , golden , slanting through the broad door-place , and a pile of fresh straw in a far corner . He drew me down upon it and kissed me . I had never known kissing before , in truth , though we all played at it now and then , carelessly . Kisses like wine , the poets sing . I do not know , but it was sweet , so sweet . For fourteen , he knew many secrets . I doubt now that I should have risen up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made for all us girls , that he could not find the closure for . He was angry at first , but , after , he laughed , saying it would be a pity to force a noble damsel . I laughed , too , and said with some chagrin that it would not have needed force , but fled from out of there anyway while my heart was still almost whole . In daylight I saw myself ruined by the straw , all rumpled and covered with chaff that I could not pick off . I made a face , saying , " Harry  --  shame ! Myp162jerkin will do , when it is brushed , but the rest of me ! My hose are in a sorry state . . . and all will guess something of this . . . I have none other . . . . " " I will send you some scarlet hose I have outgrown them  --  and a shirt , all gay with ruffling , worn once only . It will fit you , " he said , with a measuring look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laundered . " And taking hold of all my hair in his fist , he gatheredit up behind . " When we have cut your hair , you can be my page  --  " I slapped at his hand , teasing too , and so we parted , gay , and I ran up to my tower room , thankful to meet no one on the stairs  |p163It  was a fair , fine white shirt he sent , and the scarlet of the hose only a little faded from much washing ; I felt pleasure in their freshness . Never had I thought , though , to wear boy 's gear so many hours in a row . I was beginning to find it most comfortable , and might do credit as a Ganymede if ever I were at court again and masque-playing the fashion . Though this second night we came early to hall , before the first meat course had gone around , yet we found many of the soldiery far gone in their cups already . I thought , in faith , that the whole Lancaster force was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its defenders ; I was going over in my mind my reports to Owenwhen we should be safe back home . This time , we were led to the high table , where Denis Burnell sat with his lady , a thin , dark magpie creature , richly dressed . I learned later she was a London tanner 's daughter only , so that explained why Alice sat with us there too , making all even , so to speak . There were some lords there , too , beside the Percy , that I had not seen before , Le Despenser and de la Pole . Harry was late , slipping in next to me when the pasty was brought in , smellingstrong of rosewater and dressed fancily , though all in black . His tunic was rich velvet , embroidered in silver , and he wore a short cloak , flung back to show its lining of silver , too . " Are they crowning you tonight ? " I whispered meanly , and he pinched me under the table . " You have the shirt on backwards , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in return , but his boy 's muscles were too hard , so raked my fingernails , none too gently , against his leg . I think that Hotspur saw , for he wagged his finger at me , grinning , and I grew all hot . And so we giggled and played the fool through all the speeches , while most of the company swilled . They were dull speeches truly , with no cheering , and no songs such as we have at home , and concerned taxation and boundariesmostly , I think , though Hotspur drew up a list of monies due him that was to go to the king . All present huzzahed at that , so Ip164gathered that Lancaster owed them all . The prince simply shrugged and said , " Mea non culpa , " at which all laughed . There were a good many Cistercian monks about ; I recognized them from their habits , thinking shame of them , for it is a Welsh order , owing allegiance to Owen . There were a group of minstrels , too , at one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bards , even , among them . I noticed they did not stick together , as such folk do usually , but roamed about the room , listening and lookingcuriously at the fallen drunkards and the dicing soldiers . I caught sight , too , of that Hywele Sele whom I had seen last evening . Again he played a kind of small torture on his attendant henchman , who was already snoring among the rushes . I looked more closely at this man , too , seeing him swarthy and , it seemed , small , though he was lying down ; he was covered , even to his hands , with thick black hair . " Who is that fellow ? " I asked Harry and pointed . " Davy Gam , he is called , though that is a kind of nickname . . . I do not know his true name but he is your father 's blackestenemy , to hear him talk . " " He is black , anyway , " I said , wrinkling up my nose . " Do not be so nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He is only halfway to an ape . . . and he is a loyal Lancaster . . . . " " I 'll warrant , " I said . " I can read it all over him  --  " " Be careful , girl  --  I will have you up for treason . . . . " In truth , Harry took his father 's cause most lightly ; I think that he still , at that time , thought all this strife would be settled shortly , without much shedding of blood . We watched the Lord of Nannau , swaying a little , laboriously take a smoldering splinter from the fire and hold it to the sole of Davy Gam 's thin leather boot ; he would hold it there , very still , till the heat penetrated somewhat to the insensible figure , then the foot would draw up , as if involuntarily and curl against the other calf , though the man did not wake . This gave Hywele Sele much glee , and he would heat the brand again and apply it to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it the occupationof a backward boy , rather than a man of responsible nature . I saw that one of the bard minstrels was struck by this pantomime , too , and stood watching from some little distance . I looked again at this man ; there was somewhat familiar about him , but I could not put my mind upon it . It was perhaps hisp165calling and his dress , like so many at home , but there was something else , too . Though his long beard was white , and his face , where it showed under his minstrel 's hood , looked brown as parchment , yet he stood tall , taller than any in that hall . As he saw me watching , he bent his back , turning and reaching his hands out to the fire . Just another poor begging bard , I thought , with no voice left and little music to his strings . The food was plentiful , but something greasy , and I had no knife to cut my meat . Harry cut it up for me and fed me morsels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , I pretending to be his pet dog , and making sounds like little barks and lickings . Rhisiart , three places down , wore a look of disgust , so haughtyNormanthat we two were sent off into giggles anew . Truly some spirit of foolery had entered us this night ! Harry said , attempting to ape Hotspur 's North Country speech , " Hinny thee hasa'most the mumming-genius of thy wold fader " which dissolvedme anew , for it so lacked ear . I replied , he , for sure , took after his own dullard dad , who must have , as I had heard , ever a paid fool about to do his mimicry for him . " Oh , aye , " he said , sober for a moment and something sad , I thought . " The sun will set in the east before ever poor Hercules may imitate any man . . . though he is an agile mountebank , for sure . . . . " I was curious and thought to ask him more but saw something which made me reach out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Lord of Nannau had left off his play-torment and let fall the smoking brand , while he stared at the tall stranger bard . This man stood now at full height again , and as my eyes went to his face , I felt a queer shock go through me . At the same time , Harry'sfingers came down tight over my hand . " It is . . . yes , look . . . it is . . . . " " Owen . . . " I whispered . The white beard had slipped an inch below his chin , and the gleam of gold showed under . The two kinsmen stared , like figures in a masque that have lost their words , while the whole company sat oblivious , and we two , Harry and I , watched as if a spell were on us . From the tail of my eye , I saw that Davy Gam 's short bow lay beside him on the floor ; the Lord of Nannau fitted arrow to it , took aim , and let fly . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was he , moved to one side . The arrow went through his shoulder , pinning his mantle , and sticking out on the other side . I saw his face quiver withp166the sudden pain , but he threw back his mantle , drew his bow , fitted the arrow , still with that awful barb through his shoulder and , seemingly without taking aim , shot the man Hywele Sele in the throat . He fell to the floor without a sound , blood pumping in an arc from the vein . It was an awful tableau , still without sound , except for scatteredsnoring and the rattle of dice ; Hotspur half-rose from his seat but was stopped by Owen 's voice , as he stood there , calmly fitting another arrow to the short bow in his right hand . " The first man who makes a move will get my next arrow ! The Lord of Nannau lies dead , for his hand shook , and mine did not  --  nor will ! Behind me are my henchmen . . . ready at a word . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that force of Cistercians and minstrel men , too , with cloaks flung back and arrows poised . Owen gave an impatient shake of his head , not taking his eyes off the company , and the hood fell back , showing his tawny hair and the iron circlet of Eliseg at his brow . He looked a calm and angry Zeus , ready to loose a thunderbolt . " I am come for my - hostages ! If they tell me all is well , we will go in peace for now . If they have been harmed in any way . . . I have an army at the foot of the hill , a thousand strong , and we will fire this castle . . . . " No man there had weapon to hand , and none moved . Beside me I heard Harry 's voice , clear in the hush . " My lord prince  --  you may kill me where I sit , for I am unarmed , but I will yet take my farewell of this , my old friend . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet also . The pointing arrow in Owen 's hand shifted , its shaft toward us , and a gasp went up from the table Alice , maybe , or Burnell 's lady . " A kiss will not harm her , " said Harry , and , taking me in his arms , he kissed me tenderly and long . Then , taking me by the hand , he led me boldly up to where Owen stood , the arrow never swerving from him all the while . Right up to arm 's length from Owen he led me , giving my fatherstare for stare . Then he turned me to him , holding me by the shoulders , and said , " I can plight you my heart 's troth only , but this will seal it . . . . " And he drew off a ring , slipping it onto my finger in the sight of all . It was a great emerald , my birthstone , though he could not know , circled around most cunningly with a wreath of the little blue flowers that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lancaster colors . . . . " I whispered.  | " Yes , " he said , " it was my Grandfather Gaunt 's first gift to the Lady Kat , his dearest love  --  when they were both unfree and could not come together . She gave it me before she died . . . . " While Owen 's arrow stayed upon him , and the men behind aimed at all the company , at the ready , the prince led out each hostage in turn , treating Alice with as much courtesy as if she had been a great lady , till we all stood beside my father . Slowly , deliberately , the fighting monks closed in around us . Owen raised his voice to fill the hall . " Men of Nannau ! " he cried . " You are leaderless now  --  and Welshmen all ! I ask you only to think where your heart lies . . . I want no rioting here . . . and my hostages must get safe away . . . but later we will muster inGlendower valley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Arthur 's . . . . " He finished quietly . " Arthur and his cause bring you to the right ! " He made a sign then with his head and eyes , and his men came in closer . Harry kissed me once again and whispered in my ear , " Forget me not , Morgan . . . . " He bowed then , low , to Owen , and dropped to one knee . " Great prince of the Cymry , " he said in Welsh , " take your hostages and go in peace . . . . None will follow , I pledge my word ! " None would follow anyway , after the warning Owen had given , but it was a brave speech anyway , and Harry , as I was to learn later , always doted on ceremony and high words . I saw , as we left the hall , that the hairy fellow , Davy Gam , awake now , cradled his dead master of Nannau in his arms , sobbingand cursing . There was a pile of longbows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wall . Several of our men gatheredthem up on the way ; they were well trained already , I thought . I had imagined we would go over the ruined wall , but the great gate stood open , with its guards fallen , dead maybe , and a man of ours , his monk 's robe girded up , keeping watch . We made our way down the hill , slithering and sliding in the loose earth and gravel , for we did not use the road . There were men there , too , though not near the thousand Owen had boasted , with horses pilfered from the stables . Someone helped me to mount , very high it seemed ; it was dark there in the shadow of the castleI could not see my white sleeve even . But when we had riddenp168a little ways and were onto the flat plain , I saw by the light of the sickle moon and the stars that the mount under me was Mercury ; I recognized the bridle and bit , with the arms of Lancaster set in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change them for his own . I said as much to Owen , who rode beside me . " It is not all you have had of that young cockerel , it seems . . . . Has he had kisses only from you ? " " That is all , Father . . . but yet  --  we agree well . . . . " " I doubt it not . . . . He is a bonny lad and brave , too . . . . " I heard him chuckle in the dark . " He had no surety I would not let fly at him  --  yet of all the company , only he defied me . . . . " We rode in silence for a little , each with his own thoughts ; then Owen said heavily , " I would not see him debauch you , my Morgan . . . . He has the name of it  --  for all his tender years . . . . " We have jested a little . . . and he has sung me songs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were children , and he lodgingat the Tower . . . . " " Aye  --  I remember . . . poor Richard loved him well . " I said then , " The Baron of Nannau will they cry vengeancefor him , do you think ? " " I know not , " he said , slowly . " He drew first . . . and I care not either . It is the end to an old feud . " We did not speak then for a while , I feeling he had somewhat more to say and waiting for it . Owen sighed , and I looked sharply at him but could not read his face in the near-dark . " I have not spoken of this to any . . . but long ago , when we were boys still , he did me a great grievance , this my kinsman . We had been used to winter in the south at a manor of ours there , close it was to Nannau , also . . . . There was a damsel there , not noble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our seneschal , having lost an arm in the Scottish wars she was beautiful as an angel , I thought , and holy , too . Shemeant to go to the nuns at Aberystwyth when she reached theage ; my father had dowered her he had much fondness for thatfamily . She had a real vocation ; no one questioned it . She and I  --  we had played together like sister and brother all our young years we were very close , though she was not noble . . . . I desiredher greatly that last winter , for I was turned old enough then but I would not have touched her , for that she was prom/ised to God and was my dear friend besides . That baron who lies dead . . . Hywele Sele . . . he saw her one day and took her  --  whether with her consent or not , I do not know  --  but carelessly , as though she were a doxy , and left her after without a thought . When she found herself with child , she threw herself into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; I could feel his anger , almost it was a solid thing around him that you could touch . " The wheel was turning , though it was full night , for the miller was a Latin scholar by day . . . . She was crushed against it . It was not a pretty death . . . . " " Oh , Father , " I said , groping for his hand on the reins . I had no words , but my heart swelled for that shy and feeling youth that he had been . " What was her name ? " I asked , after a bit . " It was the reign of the Black Prince , Edward , when the Welsh were loyal Englishmen . All the maidens then were named after his queen , the fair Maid of Kent , as men called her Joan . My Joan was called so , also . " " The Lord of Nannau had a black heart , " I said . " I 'm glad you killed him . " " It is nonetheless another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " The Lollards say , " I ventured timidly , " that Jesus forgives all sins  --  even the blackest " " No  --  that is too easy . . . . There is that within a man that  --  " He broke off . " Morgan . . . you forgive me ! Forgive me , " he said , very low , " forgive me the sin of your birth . . . . " I was straightway seized by a great unease ; noblemen do not , nor other men either , speak so . I could form no words . I said , and forced a little laugh , " Oh , sir I have nothing toforgive , for I would not be here beside you had you not fathered me ! " " You are a good lass to turn the thought so merrily but Iwould that you were true-born . . . . " " That I would not , " I answered , meaning it . " For I would be the Argyllwyddes ' daughter then  --  and though I esteem that lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . . . . " He laughed then , too , saying , " Well . . . that she could not , poor Margaret . . . and it is done now . . . . " Walter Brut had been riding apart from us , so as not to overhearour words , for he had much delicacy in such matters ; whenp170he felt us silent , he came near , saying , " My Lord Owen , that arrow ought to come out  --  " " You are right , young sir  --  every time this beast goes over a rut in the road , it stabs again ! Over the rise of the next hill , we will stop . There is a goodly moss that grows there by the second stream . The doctors will not have it so , but that moss has healing properties . All the old women knew of it , time out of mind . . . . " When we came to the spot , he called a halt . His shoulder must have pained him greatly , for he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Cousin , " he called to Rhisiart , " take a lantern  --  under that oak tree is a growth of fine moss  --  gather all you can and bring it back here . . . You , Walter , will you be my surgeon ? You must take a sharp knife and cut off the barb , and then pull hard and straight as you can so as to keep the wound clean . It is in the flesh only ; a few inches another way and I would be done for . " He looked at me ; in the lantern light I saw his face strained and white , though he smiled . " We have not even a petticoat to bind up the place . " " Father , " I said , " this shirt I wear is clean and soft . I will tear it from below the jerkin , where it does not show . . . it is overlong anyway . . . . And so it came to pass that the English prince 's linen bound up his enemy 's wound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The torn shirt and the hose I laid away in my clothespress ; when we fled Glendower House , at the war 's worsening , I had to leave them behind . The black stallion Mercury , though , I kept by me always , currying him mostly with my own hands ; and the ring I never took off . It was not much to go on , but it was all I had , save for Harry 's parting words . Those I told over to myself night after night in my bed through all those long , hard years.  |p171I  never thought to find myself a maid still at twenty-one , though in truth I am a married lady . It is the strange fortunes of war . For we have been at war all this time ; I can hardly rememberlife before it anymore . After Owen redeemed us four , his hostages , an uneasy truce ruled for a time . The Greys ' ransoms were paid , but they had to raise the sum from their own estates . Harry 's father would give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House was in constant threat of burning and siege , and many of its defenderswere out aforaging or sent to quell some border lord , so Owen feared for us who were living there . In the deep fastnesses of Snowdon Mountain , he found an ancient , ruined fortress and rebuilt it , making it almost impregnable . In the spring of that year , we all removed there , our whole household . I was sorry to go , for it was very gloomy ; one could never once forget there that a war was awaging . We had much company there though , at first , for more and more Welsh students fled there to us for sanctuary , as it were , and to give their swords to the Welsh cause . The little pages from Dinas Bran were among them , with their stolen arms , and they became the pets of all us damsels . We spoiled them sinfully , Lawnslot with the curly hair and the younger Madoc , until that Lawnslot got Owen with child , and they had to marry . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a foot taller , but she swore the babe was his , and he did not deny it ( though privately I thought that he was bragging only ) . Many such odd matches happened during those war years . Walter Brut was true to his word and married Alice ; he taught her to read the New Scripture for herself , and they were happy enough , though childless , in the first years of their union . And Efa , that wild girl-thing , ran away with Rhys Gethin , the Savage , and fought beside him in his hills , like another of the same . Actually , in spite of his brute looks and his deeds of terror , he became , in time , one of Owen 's most trusted captains , waging hisp172own untrammeled kind of warfare in the dark mountains where he was born ; he was the terror of the English borderers , burning and laying waste wherever he appeared . I should not have liked to see him coming at me out of the dark ! Though I suppose Efa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some strange way . When he was killed later , and his mangled body borne in on a shield , she took his sword and fell upon it , to keep him company . The twins , Gwynneth and Gwenllian , wedded their Irish redheads , but they were both killed early , leaving fatherless babes . Modry and Megolin , she who wanted to be a nun , were captured in a raid and , we heard , were made into camp harlots by the English soldiers ; I shudder to think of it , for they were delicately bred . The Argyllwyddes ran out of hair dye , and her hair all turned white ; she looked an old woman and unhappy , and her flesh hung on her , for she worried it away . Catherine has been happy , in a sort . But I am running ahead of my story . I do this often now , mixing things up , like some old dotard who can not remember yesterday but can count the dishes on his fifth birthday feast-table . But that , perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lately . I will try to set it all down in order , though it is hard to sort out . The year after we moved to Snowdon Mountain was the year of the great comet that blazed across the sky and that all Wales called Owen 's Star . In England , too , it struck fear in enemy hearts , and no armies marched against us while it stayed . It was indeed an awesome sight . I remember we all rushed out on the grim ramparts to watch it when it first appeared . It was a freezing cold night in February , though no snow fell ; our nostrils were all caked with our frozen breath , and our hands numb . The sky was blue-black , and , in the northwest , against it , that vast body of flame , trailing a huge , fiery train of lesser stars , like a swarm of burning insects . It was as bright , too , as noon , dimming the torches , and illuminating the mountain around about . The bard improvised a song that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wales , and the soldiers all shouted victory for Owen , but he himself sat deep in thought , his tankard full before him and untouched . " It is , " he said finally , to those of us who sat beside him , " no prophecy for me , no augury , but some mystery of the firmament , a star dying  --  or being born . . . . Someday astronomerswill predict these things . . . . " Owen had a fine room atp173Glendower House , all roofed with glass , anti in it instruments for star-watching he had brought back from the Eastern lands , where they have much knowledge of such things ; it is all destroyedby now , no doubt , along with the rest of that manor . The rumor of that chamber got about among the ignorant folk , and they deemed it a warlock 's chamber , where magic was worked , but Owen studied the stars there and charted their courses on great sheets of parchment . The great comet lasted in the sky some three weeks ; by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though , never warmed up , as it does usually , and snow lay on the mountain throughout the month of May ; the peaks , even , were still snowcappedin July . It was the worst year of cold any man could remember . The fortress was drafty , too , and we all had frostbitten fingers and noses that ran when we came near a fire . It was a great year of victory though for Wales , and the comet seemed truly to have foretold it . That spring Hotspur came over to us with his father , the Earl of Northumberland , and his uncle , Thomas of Percy . They made a treaty with Scotland , too , where they had just defeated the great Douglas , so we had many allies , all with their followers in the thousands . Owen took all the large cities , even into South Wales , and all men felt victory was sure . At the great battle of Bryn Glas , the Welsh archers hired by the English army turned their arrows on their masters , and turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Lord Edmund Mortimer was captured , which led to a great change in our lives , Catherine 's and mine , at least . This lord was close to the English throne ; his nephew was that Mortimer who was the rightful heir and whom Harry 's father had imprisoned when he usurped the kingdom . He had been all these years in the Tower , in captivity . Mortimer , too , was brother to Hotspur 's lady-wife , so he was with us really , underneath , for all these reasons . Also , I think he fell under Owen 's spell , as some impressionable young men do . He was a fair young man , somethingfrail in looks , but with straight neat features to his face . His only flaw was a too-short upper lip , which gave him a prettiness more suited to a girl . He was treated more as an honored guest than a prisoner , spending much time with all the household , and Catherine inp174particular . Catherine had fallen out of love with Rhisiart as though he had never been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she needed no urging but consented . I said long ago that she fell in and out of love easily . It was a good match though , for it brought Owen 's house close to the rightful English heirs ; there was much of policy in it , of course , though I think Owen would never have forced it if she had been unwilling . At least , I thought , he is not marrying her to Harry ! Rhisiart took the news of the betrothal badly , going about in his black clerk 's gown and sitting glum at meat . But after they were married , his spirits seemed to lift ; I guessed he judged it hopeless then . The couple conceived right away , and Catherine bore her first child a bare nine months after the wedding day . It was a boy , and they called it Edmund , too . So there was a Welsh heir now among the closest claimants to the English throne ! Harry was wounded in the battle of Shrewsbury , where Hotspurdied , and where the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have spies in all the English camps ) they had it that he had lost an eye , and I wept for days . Later , though , it was confirmed that it was a flesh wound only , at the temple ; he fell ill of it though , for it festered , and he was abed for weeks . They say he fought bravely , going back into battle after the wounding and turning the tide . It was our first defeat , though Owen 's army did not join them , for the river was in flood , and they could not get through . It was a big setback nonetheless , though , for all our allies were scattered after . Both the elder Percys were put to death , horribly , with quartering and beheading ; I took comfort that Harry could have had no part in it , being so sick . They were handled as traitors , their remains displayed to the sight of all , as trophies and warnings , too . Poor Hotspur was given honorable burial for his past great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the whole country refused to believe he was dead , and reports flew around that he had been seen , true to his nickname , spurring hot for the north . Lancaster could not afford to let his bones rest , for such rumors are dangerous to an unsteady throne , and so he was dug up and his body dismembered ; the head was stuck up on London Bridge , and other parts elsewhere , I forget the places . It is a grisly thought that proud , bold man ! For long , though , the war seemed to be going our way , in spitep175of the Shrewsbury disappointment . Owen took town after town and fort after fort . Prophecies were made , wild and ringing , by a man dressed up like Merlin , in a tall cone-shaped hat and long robes covered with cabalistic signs . He looked a freak to me , with his toothless mouth that distorted all his words , but the whole company was much impressed ; I have forgot his name . He said that Wales would have two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together that same year ) . He said also that a maid in armor would lead a nation to victory and anoint a king at his crowning . This was interpreted by many to point the way to one of us damsels ( whom they had all seen riding in boys ' gear ) leading Owen to the throne of England . An armorer in Aberystwyth even went so far as to make a silver armor , small enough for a girl and present it to Owen " for his warmaiden " ! Owen shook his head though and laughed a little . He said he could not feel to take a maid to battle , her tender flesh bruised by the metal . Also , he said , he did not seek the English throne or even the Welsh , but justice only for Wales and the people . His enemies ever rejected this and called him , in derision , King Owen . The old seer said also that a Tudor of Mona would sit upon the English throne and found a dynasty . " I can not fathom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was only little Efa , who is of Mona , but illegitimate , and she is dead now . . . and another , Owen Tudor , a distant kinsman of mine . But he is far away , at the French court , and is only petty nobility , without wealth or power . " At any rate the seer foretold also that the Lancasterswould plunge England into a war that would last a hundredyears before it was done . Which would seem to me to cancel out all the other prophecies . Later , Owen made a treaty with the French , who gave him men and even cannons , and many more towns were taken and hopes ran high . We removed again , though , for the Argyllwyddes feared another winter on Snowdon . We went to Harlech Castle , which has one whole side to the sea and stands on a high hill besides . It is the strongest castle in Wales , they say . It is pleasanter , certainly , for the seaward side is all open , with many windows and balconies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cruel . Catherine 's two other children were born here  --  a boy and girl . With these three and the twins ' babes , and Olwen 's , we have six children among us who know nothing but war !  |p176Meredith  was wounded , it was thought mortally , in a minor battle in a town I can not recall . He recovered , though , for Elliw nursed him lovingly for months . He has lost the use of an arm , though , and limps badly , too . But at least he will not have to fight again . After a long time he consented to marry Elliw , who loves him dearly . I think he loves her too , but he will not give her children . He says he will not bring a child into a world as ugly and war-torn as this . He has changed greatly since his long recovering ; he thinks Owen should give up the quarrel and surrender . I am of his mind , too , but Owen says he can not now , he is committed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the hope of the peasantry . He is right , of course , and in honor he can not fail them , but , oh , it is a weary struggle . With all our victories , and even with the French to help , we have still not won , and Lancasterkeeps coming back still in new places . Owen says it is the boy he fears , meaning Harry . Reports are that Harry is the real warriorthere now ; indeed , his father has left him lately in full command ; they say he is ill almost unto death , the king . On the eve of the battle of Usk , Owen called me to him , saying that he feared greatly to leave me always without a protector and asked if I would not wed with Rhisiart . He had hoped , he said , to find a nobler match for me but says that he esteems Rhisiart greatly , though he is a penniless man , and in any case I have a fine dower . I was taken aback , for Rhisiart had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Owen ; perhaps it is the Norman way . I do not love him , and indeed I think for him , too , I will always be second best . We agree well though , and in a kind of reasonablenessand weary , too , I consented . We were married in the little chapel here at noon , with Owen reading the services , for none of the priests are left among us . They left for battle an hour later , Owen going with a large host to push forward over the English border , and Rhisiart , with all the brothers that are left , to Usk . I have not seen him since . He was captured in that battle , and Walter Brut with him ; I know not if he lives . Owen 's brother Tudor was killed that day , and Griffith , his oldest son . Griffith was the Argyllwyddes ' favorite , and she will not be comforted and blames Owen . She says he took the safer course and left her son to die . It is cruel and untrue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will all go mad , truly , I think , those of us that are left . Wep177have been under siege here at Harlech for nearly eight months . There is only Meredith left among the men ; the Lord Mortimer , Catherine 's husband , was in command , but he died the second month . It looked like the plague , and we buried him quickly to escape the contagion ; he was unshriven , but none of us here are very religious anymore . I keep remembering what Walter said , the Lollard that all men , all living things , when they die , rest inthe lap of Jesus . Since Mortimer , there have been more than twenty plague-deaths , all buried in a common grave ; among them were Catherine 's two youngest , she has only the little Edmundleft . Though they are buried all , there is still a plaguestench . It clings to our clothes and hair even ; whatever we eat seems to taste of it . This last does not matter , for we have almost nothing to eat in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eaten ; Mercury went early , I could not refuse , to save human lives . I hope if Harry hears he will forgive me . They say he is outside the walls , commandingthe siege . I one time went up on the wall to look , but could not see him among the multitude below . The Argyllwyddes died last night , poor lady , about the hour of vespers . We none of us would eat the rat stew she made , flavored with leeks . Meredith told her rats can not be eaten , for they carry contagion , but she was crazed , I think , and scolded us for refusingcooking from her own hands , like some silly proud housewife . She died from that , I am sure , for she ate it as eagerly as if it were fine venison . It is dreadful to think on ; she has the plague-look too , all black about the face and the tongue protruding . There are none to bury her ; we are all too weak . I watch Meredith move , slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I am the same . Catherine can not walk at all , but lies in her own filth . She does not make a sound , but little Edmund moans constantly and calls for water . There is none left . Our lips are horribly cracked and our voices croak ; we are walking skeletons besides . I am wearing my jerkin and hose now , for I fear the men outside if we fall into their hands . I hacked my hair off with an old kitchen-knife last week ; it is a rough job but perhaps will make me look like a page and save me from raping . The others of us women have not that much energy , most of them just lie about . Truly , I can not think who would want to ravish us , for we are all subhuman by now , but they say that soldiers are desperate.  |p178Meredith  says we must surrender , or we will surely all die , even if Owen 's troops get through to us tomorrow . By then it will be too late . Catherine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is unconscious . I nod my head , for I can not get a sound from my parched throat . Maybe Harry , if he is outside there , will save me from the soldiers . . . maybe he will even give me water . . . Oh , Harry  --  for a little drop of water . . . .  |p181I  am called the king 's fool , or jester , some say . I have never jested in my life , even before I became what I am . As a small child I did not grow as my brothers and sisters did ; I was puny and weak , like the runt of a litter . Had my mother not begged for my life , I should surely have been exposed on the bare craggy outcroppings of Navarre , where I was born . As it was , I grew a little ; when I was eight , I had the stature of a healthy two-year-old . I was not deformed and , I think , not ugly then , though none of us had ever looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I the youngest , on our few small , near-barrenacres . I can remember very little of my brothers and sisters , save that they hit me and threw stones , spitting , for they feared my oddity . I was much alone , with whatever thoughts I had . I did not know then that I was clever , but clever I must have been . I could make songs in my head and sing words to them , too , and I could coax music out of the simplest reed pipe . My mother protectedme , saving scraps from her own plate , for my food was alwaysstolen by my biggest brothers . When she died , I almost starved , until my father sold me . You do not think children are sold in this year of grace , 1409 ? I assure you it is true still , as it was then , not so many years ago . You have only to go to the remoter provinces , where famine lies heavy on the land ; human beings can not live on air . My father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had ever held in his hand before . I do not blame him . Neither do I remember him with love , for I did not know its face . My mother may have loved me ; she sometimes laid a pitying hand lingeringly on my hair ; I know she never held me in her arms as she did those other , large childrenthat were hers , too . I was bought by a group of strolling mountebanks ; they were not unkind folk , easygoing and generous , too , when they had the wherewithal . They fed me well , on wine and lean meats mostly , for they did not want me to grow . They trained me , too ; by the time I was ten I could turn three somersaults in the air and comep182down on a shoulder , and I knew every song in their repertoire , besides my own . The people laughed and applauded me in every market town ; I was known as the Little Flea . My success was assured , and I grew to love their laughter ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then , alas , when I reached thirteen , I began to grow . I filled out , and my arms and legs lengthened . I reached the height I am now , about that of a ten-year-old boy , and there I stopped . I was still small , but I was no longer the Little Flea . Indeed , I was no longer of any use , for a clever ten-year-old is no novelty . At the next large market town , I was sold again . They wept , those player-folk , for their hearts are given easily , and they made me parting gifts sweetmeats and little trinkets . I wept , too , for I feared the large man who had paid over the money ; his hand , as he felt my muscles , had been rough and heavy , though his clothes were fine . I had done right to fear , for what came after was nightmare . You would not believe , indeed , but that my face is here before you , living proof that I do not lie . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a higher sort ; they were mummers , and played in real plays , with story and action , each taking one part . The plays themselves are all much alike ; the big part is for the " good man " who is beset by devils and triumphs in the end ; that part , though , is dull and cloddish , for there is nothing in it to laugh at . The real star parts are for the imps of Satan , who can do anything they like to be funny and entertaining , before the course of the play vanquishes them , and they are led off in chains , back to hell . These parts are taken by all manner of folk , so long as they be ugly or deformed , because people like to laugh at such unfortunates . The new playpeoplehad seen me perform and knew me talented ; I needed a real deformity to play an imp , aside from my small stature . I was too old by then , nearly fourteen , to cripple by iron braces on my back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break my legs , for then I would lose my mobility . They have skilled surgeons from the East to do what was done on me , and poppy drugs to dull the pain ; it is outlawed , to be sure , for the practice is going out , and the operation must be done in secret . I have seen older mountebanks with nostrils split like felons or eyes that bulged hugely from slitting ; there arep183many such freaks of the knife still about . On me they carved a laugh ! It is more of a grin , really , for the lips are removed , and the teeth exposed right round to the back jaw . I needed no skill on the stage after that , for the crowd roared at first sight of me , though it cut down my effectiveness as a singer , for the words whistle without the lips to form them . I have only looked into a mirror once ; I saw fine , curling , brown hair on a broad brow , and eyes , brown , too , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have seen . I was , in my time , the greatest of the imps ; folk flocked to see me at each saint 's day ; in the courts , too , they paid much money for my services . I saw none of it , of course , except for my board and keep , and got little satisfaction from my work either . I do not know now , truly , why I took such pains to be at the top of my profession , for the laugh that greeted my first appearance never ceased to stab at my heart . But always I would give them more , and they loved me , my audiences , in their way . I was envied , too , by my fellows , especially the younger ones . Many times I have heard a childish voice beg to " have a laugh made , like Hercules ! " This you will hardly credit , but it is a strange profession . My name , Hercules , came from the first imp I played . Often the imps were called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuck , because of my small size , and the paradox of it . I was famousthroughout Navarre . The duke there paid such a price for me that the company all went into retirement and lived on the proceeds . And that was how I came to court . He was a good man , the duke , and kind , though the Lady Joanna , his daughter , used to pinch me cruelly whenever she was out of temper . He gave me to her when she went into Brittany to marry there , though I begged to stay with him in Navarre . He said she needed some lightness about her , for she was to wed the old Breton duke , a man much older than her father himself . He was not too old to give her children though , that duke , and they mellowed her somewhat . Two daughters and four sons she had of him , and much loving courtesy . He was a wise and gentle man , the Duke of Brittany , and I wept when he died , though none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my widowed duchess ' hand , she looked upon him with favor , for he had been at the Breton court during his exile , a handsome , ruddy fellow.  |p184She  sent me to him as earnest of her intent ; a princely gift , for my name was known throughout Europe . My fame did not keep them from shipping me chained in a cage like a monkey though . I was sick all the way across the channel . My first sight of my new master , King Henry IV of England , put me near to swooning ; I had need of all my mummer 's art to keep the leap of recoil from my eyes . He was clad all in armor , though the day was hot , and he sat at meat indoors ; his hands were bandaged clear up the forearm , the fingers swollen like sausages . His face  --  well , in a sort , it was worse than mine . His high handsomeness was gone , and ulcerous sores covered it , where there were not dead scabs clinging ; his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was mostly gray , with here and there a gleam of brassy red like a mocking ghost-light . He spoke heavily , too , his voice limping . The illness which ravaged him has no name , for the doctors pronounce it a mystery . By some it is called Saint Anthony'sFire others name it ergot ; I have even heard leprosywhispered . Ho-ho , I thought , my fine lady , will you bed with this ? For I had not much love for the Duchess Joanna . He spake me civilly though , commanding a sample of my art then and there , to amuse his sons , who sat with him , all but the eldest , then on an early campaign in Wales . I had not much stomach for it , being still sick from the sea , but I sang and capered , giving of my best , for it is my trade . The young boys , lively as jackdaws , beat their hands together and drummed their heels , laughing and shouting , and all the company cheered . When I had finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , embroidered with pearls and heavy with coin . " What say you , He Who Laughs ? " said the monarch , without a smile . " Will you wear my livery ? " " I had as lief stay in my own , " I answered , for I wore always a red imp suit , with horns and pitchforked tail ; I had several of them , of all cloths and weights , gifts from my first duke . And I added , low , for license is my trade , too , and I saw sardony in his blue eyes , " If it please you King of Scabs ! " I bowed low , waiting . And it came , his laughter , rich and loud , filling the hall . He laughed till the tears ran down among his boils and ulcers , and the whole company sat , uneasy and mystified , for none had heard our exchange . " A doughty fellow you are indeed , sirrah ! Well , well you willp185wear my Lancaster badge over your heart , anyway  --  so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like you well , little brother . . . " And he tossed me another purse , larger than the first , before he stalked from the room , clanking in his armor . That was my first encounter with the man who , I think , is loved by none but me . We are , as the Lombards say , simpatico . Poor big and little brother ! The sons of Lancaster I studied well , finding them all different under their like comely faces ; Tom is careless and something rough of tongue , and has little thought for anything but hunting and hawks , John is quiet , and Humphrey sly . The eldest , the young Henry , I did not see till he was called back for his father 's wedding . The Lady Joanna had been warned of her groom 's skin affliction , for she wore a gauze veil to escape contagion . She had not , I think , been told how long this affliction had lain upon him , near nine months now , or the havoc it had wrought with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gasp when her eyes met his . The Prince Henry heard , too , and when he bent to kiss her hand , his eyes were hostile . He turned away and , as if idly , but clear enough , said to Tom , who stood behind him , " Is our new stepmothera blackamoor then , that she hides her face ? " Tom laughed , in his thoughtless way , and I saw my master frown . They quarrel much among themselves , this family , even to the little girls , but they are a clannish lot and do not like outsiders . I saw the lady-queen would have her hands full with this brood , besides the calamity of the new husband 's health ; almost I could have pitied her . Indeed , it is six years now since she first came to England , and the prince treats her still with no more than cool courtesy . He is another cut of cloth from his brothers , though all share the warm brown coloring they are said to have got from their mother . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like a beast ready to spring . Though he is a scant year older than Tom , he bore himself like a man , while Tom was a very boy . I saw the prince that day lean and hard as a veteran fighter , though he had been then only months in the Welsh marches . They said , though , that he had ever excelled at all sports and at jousting ; men named him the finest athlete in the realm . They named him other , too ; he had a taste for wine , and women , too , already , atp186fifteen . The Tavern Prince , they called him , and laughed . The Lancasters are not popular rulers ; my master was named usurper still behind his back and plotted against , though Richard , whom he deposed , was a weakling and beggared the country . But then , I heard my first duke say once that England had ever hated her kings . The young prince was not all fighter and roisterer . He had much love of learning and wrote a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than mine , though my Navarrese master had me taught by a scholar . He did not laugh at my antics , this prince , though he applauded with the others and gifted me handsomely ; I sensed he found my carven mask hard to look upon . He would take my lute , though , with a will , and play upon it with some skill . Songs of his own making he would play ; they are good , though not so good as my own . He has been much away , during these years , fighting the Welsh . Each time he returned he was taller and leaner and harder , too , with a stiller face . There is a scar , also , at his temple , star-shaped , like a third eye , that he got at the battle of Shrewsbury . This Shrewsbury fight was the first loss the Welsh suffered ; before , all had gone their way . Father and son both fought in this battle , though ; after , the king 's sickness kept him abed a good part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Oxfordphysician , who had tended him for a fever after his wound . He set great store by this man , for he was skilled in all the newer practices . He brought him to his father , who lay suffering from a gnawing pain in his vitals ; he was dizzy , too , and often vomited blackish blood . Nicholas Colnet was the doctor 's name ; he was closeted for some hours with the sick man . He did not bleed him , for he held it did no good but only weakened . When he came out , his face was very long . " I think , " he said , slowly , " that it is not leprosy . I think it is not contagious , either , for none close to him have taken it , not even his lady-wife , or the maids who handle his slops . . . I think it is a disease of the ancients , that eats away tissueas it runs its course . They called it the Crab , for its persistent gnawing . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seeing the prince 's face white and shocked . " He may yet live long . . . he must rest . This illness abates sometimes , and the patient will seem better but then it gnaws again . . . and in the end . . . . "  |p187He  laid his hand on the prince 's shoulder . " But the end is not yet . . . . " The prince swallowed and spoke falteringly . " His face will itnot mend ? " " It is the same thing gnawing at his outside , " answered Colnet . " His body is worse eaten under his clothes . We can do no more than lay soft cloths for protection . . . there is no pain though , from the sores . . . and I will give him a drug for the other . " When the Queen Joanna heard there was no contagion , she left off the wearing of her face-veil ; I saw her cheeks were plumper and the flesh beginning to sag , though her eyes are black and shining still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I think she does not share the king 's bed , even when he is up and about and home from the wars ; I think he dreads her disgust and so forbears . But she suffers from it , for she has naught to occupy her days either . She has taken to eating largely and sitting long at table over the wine . She wears new dresses every day and changes her style of hair often ; I can see that her stepsons think her frivolous and silly . She has about her , too , many Breton ladies that dabble in herb lore and even sorcery , in a small way . She is forever making new pastes for the king 's face , usually from such loathsome ingredients as toad 's blood and bat excrement ; he wears them to please her . Some days his face is all white and stiff with a powdery concoction ; other days it may be a green color and shiny . She giggles with her women over love philters , too , and they make eyes , all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Courts of Love are going out , when every lady had swains who swore to love her in all purity and obey her every command ; this world is too modern now for that . The Lady Joanna , though , would like to have them back , for she is bored . I have not said much about Lollardy , which is another disease that eats at my king . There is none abroad , in parts where I have lived , but in England they say one out of every three is Lollard , and the war in Wales is , in somewise , being fought over it , for the Baron Glendower much favors this sect , and many who love the New Learning have flocked to his standard . Myself , I can not care one way or the other , for religion does not make good sense to me , as you can understand . What God would have made me unlike my fellows or allowed men to work bestiality upon me forp188profit ? And yet folk are dying in the flames in the name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My master , though , is not a thoughtful man and is much swayed by his crafty archbishop besides . I think he seeks , by his persecution of heretics , to ease his own sins . Archbishop Arundel is a high-born prelate , elder kinsman by marriage to King Henry ; he has been given much power in the realm . Though he is a man of God , he has a face of pure evil , the lines bitter and deep and the eyes hooded as a falcon 's . When I attend my master by Arundel 's side , for sure the three of us could consume the poor heretic with plain fear , without the aid of fire ! That man of God , Arundel , has sworn to make all heretics " hop headless " and " fry faggots " ; he has a grisly , monkish humor . I have witnessed one such burning , and I wish never to see another . There was a certain tailor of Evesham , his name was John Badby , if I remember right . He had refused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of doctrine on which all the Lollards agree , though they argue among themselves on others . This is also one of the basic laws of the True Church , so he was sentenced to die at the stake , and was turned over , as is the custom , to the secular arm . There had been no such executions in that part of the country before , and the authorities were uncertainof procedure . Thinking to deal mercifully , they had fashioneda wooden cask , large enough to hold a man , and they put him inside , with the faggots heaped under . They had considered he would die there inside , with his agonies unseen ; they had forgotthat wood burns faster . The king was there , and Arundel , and the prince was commandedto attend , as a lesson ; he had many friends among these heretics , at Oxford and in the taverns of London , where they teach , defying the law . As for myself , my master , at this time , was in the habit of taking me with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I saw the prince pale as porridge under his campaign-weatheredface , and a muscle beside his mouth twitched visibly . He carried a sheaf of papers , rolled up . The marketplace was gay , hung with the Lancaster colors , and the arms of Holy Church , and crowded with folk , all dressed in their holiday best , and jostling one another for the first places . Vendors threaded between them , selling smoked eels . A little breeze carried their smell , pungent and oily . The king sat underp189a small tent , blue and white , raised from the crowd by several wooden steps . It was a rare day for England , diamond-bright , with a hint of frost in the air . The prince spoke to his father . " Sire , give me leave to speak with the prisoner " The king gestured . " It is for your lord archbishop to give . . . . " Arundel half-turned , his face malevolent under that gaudy canopy . He shrugged a little . " It is out of my hands . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mayor , the sheriff , and whatever dignitaries the town possessed . The prince went down the steps and spoke to them , low . They answered , and I heard his voice rise , a little shrill as I had never heard it , " But the man must have a chance to recant ! It is the law ! " The prince came up the steps again , turning to his uncle , Henry Beaufort , " Sire , they have sealed the cask with lead  --  I can not speak with the man " Beaufort rose . " This is a miscarriage of justice , Your Majesty  --  The man must have a chance to recant  --  to save his soul . . . . " " Quiet , boy  --  " said the archbishop . " They are lighting the faggots ! " He leaned forward in his seat . The first small flames licked up , while the whole crowd fell silent . Suddenly the cask burst into flames like a torch . As the wood burned away quickly , for a mere second the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leaving the prisoner standing in his chains and penitent 's robe . The prince ran to the mayor again , in his excitement grabbing at the man 's robe , so that it came away in his hands . We could not hear his words for the yelling of the crowd , blooded now . But we saw soon that the prisoner had his chains struck off and was brought to the prince . There was a little hush , for this was an unusualproceeding . The prince unrolled his sheaf of papers , holdingthem up to the doomed man 's sight . " Look look here iswhat you must say . . . I had it from Walter Brut , who escaped the stake . . . the bread and wine become the body and blood of Christ in a spiritual sense . . . it remains bread . . . but more than bread . . . do you hear ? More than bread . . . . " We saw him strained , his hand shaking where it held the papers . The manp190thus brought forward was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hair singed away , but his swollen lips curved in a little smile ; we saw that he was past middle age . It was plain that he took the prince for a student only , for his dress was sober and he bore no arms . " Master Scholar , " the tailor said , " you waste breath . . . the bread is bread only , and the wine . . . it remains thus . . . Our Saviour has no need of miracles . . . it remains bread . . . . " What followed is too dreadful to tell . They bound the man again , relighting the faggots ; he began to sing , in a high , reedy voice , a hymn I did not know . The Cardinal Beaufort led the prince back to his seat . I heard him say , " Father , I have served you well these last years in Wales give me leave to go from here . . . . " " You will stay , " said my master , heavily ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The flames leaped up again , hiding the tailor from view , but we heard the singing change to a long drawn-out howl of animal agony , and a horrible stench of burningfilled the air . They have since , I heard , in these executions , employed the sweet young voices of choirboys to drown out the victim , but these were early days still . He screamed horribly until the end . " Bring your head up , Harry , " hissed his father . " Do not shame Lancaster before the whole realm . . . . " The prince stared ahead then , stiff as a statue . And I . . . whenever a drop of candlewax falls on my hand , I think of these poor wretches in the flames . The smell of smoked eels , also , ever turns my stomach , and I have not eaten them since that day.  |p191The  rebellion in Wales , after seven long years , is now well-nigh put down , though there are scattered skirmishes even now . Glendowerlooked often to be winning , for he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French king , Charles of Valois , men and cannon , too . He had penetrated all the way into our English shires of Hereford and Monmouth , but at the end the French help was withdrawn , and so the English came to victory after great losses . Much of the countryside is left in waste , though it is said that in Wales the destructionis even greater . Glendower has slipped the noose , though , and can not be found , though most of his family has been killed or captured ; they say he is hiding in his own dark hills and will come again at the call of his countrymen , but they are ever superstitious , the Welsh . The nobles that followed him are punishedwith death or imprisonment and their lands confiscated , though there is not much left in that waste for Lancaster ; war does little for the victor either , as my first duke said . Glendower 's peasant army is decimated , their hopes of betterment gone , and men say the Lollards are all flown , too . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here in our London taverns . Never would I give any away though , for I would not be party to such cruelty as I saw once done . My master , the king , has grown overpious ; he had not before paid more than lip service to his God . Some say he fears his own death , seeing its marks on his ailing body , and is consumed by great remorse ; I know not . For sure , he pardons none , neither Welsh nor English of the traitors ; they have all suffered horribly . The commons do not love him ; they hail his son , the prince , though , as he rides past them , deeming him the great young saviorof their land . Much hostility had grown of late between these two Henrys , father and son . The father resents that the people show their love for the youthful hero , and the son chafes under the strict controls put upon him and the poorness of his purse , too , for the king owes him for his duties in Wales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . It is true that youngp192Henry often goes short ; I have loaned him monies myself , for the king is generous to his fool . He is in debt , too , to all his attendant nobles , though all they have comes from him in the first place . He keeps , when he is home , a fine house of his own though . It is called Coldharbour , a fair mansion in the Chepe , belonging to Sir William Poultney . It is laid all about with fine fruit trees , enclosed in green lawns , walled with brick , and with one gardenendopen to the Thames . The prince could not have afforded it , but Sir William owed him favor for saving his Hereford lands from Glendower , and asked no more rent than a rose on Midsummer'sDay . It is a pretty conceit , that . Sir William was one of the lords dead Richard had about him ; they were all effete and fanciful . He is an honored guest in his own house , with the pick of all Henry 's helm-cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though , a dwellingof great charm and sweetness ; I have spent much time there myself , my services borrowed while my kingly master lay ill and the prince entertained . It was there , to that mansion in the Chepe , that Henry brought the girl men called the Welsh Harlot , or , some said , Owen 's whore . This last , certainly , is not true ; she is the daughter of Glendower , out of wedlock , from some well-born Welsh lady . She herself , too , I have found to be a lady of true and noble heart , with a fine learning and wit besides . But men will ever speak ill of those in high places . It was after the siege of Harlech Castle , in Wales , which lasted many months . It was the last stronghold there to fall , and there were not many survivors at the end . By this time Prince Henry was sole commander in the Welsh parts , so all the garrison fell to him . He rode by slow stages to England with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ill unto death . Meredith , son of Owen , and Catherine , Glendower 's daughter , he brought , her with her son by Mortimer , who is perished . They are the last of Owen 's line , it is believed , besides the girl who became Henry 's mistress . There was Meredith 's wife , too , and some ladies of Owen 's court , with their babes . They were all lodged in the Tower , prisoners of the crown , but were given gentle care and nursing , by the prince 's orders . Couriers had ridden ahead to bring the news of the victory and Henry 's arrival , and my master , for once not too ill to keep to his bed , awaited his son in the Coldharbour house . I think he hadp193expected to see the spoils of war in chains behind Harry 's horse ; for sure he did not know of the Welsh girl at all . We sat , my master and I , for I was much beside him then , watching the iron gates on Chepe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He took us by surprise , for he came by barge , up the Thames , with but a few of his personal guard beside him . He strode in , giving his father short greeting ; his face was set in hard lines . He bore a burden in his arms , all wrapped about in furs , for it was November and chill . This shapeless bundle he carried past us , not stopping , into his own upstairs chamber , calling for serving maids as he went . I saw amazement sit upon his father 's ravaged features and some affront , too , so said nothing ; I never wished to draw the Lancaster wrath . When the prince returned , after some minutes , he answered , to his father 's query , that all the prisoners he had lodged in the Tower , bringing them there by the same barge he had come off from through his own gate . " For they are too ill , " he said , " to travel by litter . The Lady Catherine , and her little son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " A ghost of a smile curved his lips as he saw his father cross himself with a shaking hand ; he knew his sire 's fear of the plague-death . " Morgan I have brought here , to my own house . . . she is not sick but weak only and half-starved still . . . though I have fed her with my own hand . . . . " " Another doxy ! " shouted the father , his boils purpling with choler . " You have little need of more to soil the name of Lan-caster ! " The prince looked at him in his still way and said , in an even voice , " She is no doxy , Father . . . but an old friend I knew at Richard 's court when I was hostage there . . . . I met her again when the tables were turned , and she was hostage to us . Her fatherclaimed her , coming himself into the enemy camp . . . he men call the Baron Glendourdy . He took her out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none had courage to say himnay . . . . " There was a little silence , and then King Henry said , quiet now also , " Ah , yes , Hal  --  you ever admired more your enemies than your true blood ! It was Richard first you raised sword tome over him , young as you were . . . and the traitor Hotspur , too , him you loved well . Men say now that it is by the prince 's hand that yon whoreson Owen slipped through our lines ! "  |p194I  saw that small muscle twitch again in the prince 's jaw , but he did not move , else , but said , still very quiet , " I think you know , sire , my loyalty is not in question . . . my sword , and my heart , too , has been yours , in all these battle years . . . Little profit have I had from it either . . . . " A bitter note had crept into his voice ; it has been there , under , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The king , stung by the prince 's words , for he knew his own stinginess for a byword in the streets , said curtly , " You will have monies from me this week , in part payment toward what is owed . . . . " " It can wait , Father I spoke in anger . . . I know the realm is poor . I would have the doctor Colnet back for a little though . . . it might be he can save Catherine and the little Edmund . And I would have you give courteous greeting to my Morgan . . . I have not asked many favors of you , sire . . . . " The king sat , frowning . " She is bastard surely ? " " Your father of Gaunt had many bastards . . . they sit now among the highest in the land . . . After a moment the king made a weary gesture , shrugging a little . " You may bring her to me here , then , Hal . . . but she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have Owen 's whelp at court . . . . " Prince Henry smiled thinly , an old look on a young face , " She is not fit for court , in any case . . . I hope , indeed , that her legs can hold her up . . . . " He made as if to go , then turned . " Thank you , Father . " The prince was gone for some moments . My master stared into the fire , fingering his dried-up scabs . He laughed suddenly , a harsh sound . " Will she faint at sight of us , little brother ? " I laughed too ; it was not so farfetched a thought . " I remember , " I said , " a lady at the court of Brittany . She was with child and miscarried after the play . The duke allowed no pregnant women at performances after that . The child was not marked though . . . . That lady , after her churching , gave ten gold pieces to Our Lady 's chapel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not pregnant then , " said the king in wry manner . " Is she not a maid then ? "  | " I have heard that Owen married off all his daughters during these years , even those base-born ones . . . I think she is a weddedwoman or mayhap a widow . . . . " It looked , though , no such who came to us then . I would have sworn , indeed , that a boy looked out from under that cropped hair . It was a starveling boy , to be sure ; the bones pushed through her skin , sharp-pointed , and her face was whiter than skimmed milk , the veins showing blue at the temples . Like a wraith she walked , too , and insubstantial , but walk she did , and her eyes were steady . It must have cost her great control to look upon the pair of us in her weakened state , but her face showed nothing as she bowed before the king . The prince bent over her tenderly , raising her up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her own clothes were all rags anddirty , too . . . . " " Dirty ! " She looked at the prince sidewise , her mouth curving in woeful merriment . " They could stand alone ! " She laughed , a small bright sound . " It may be they are walking about up there in your chamber , Harry lonely for the creature who inhabitedthem so long ! " The prince laughed then , too , as I had never heard him , loud and free . I saw that he looked upon this wretched scarecrow as if she were the fairest lady in the realm , his face all lit as with a thousand candles . Truly he loves this lady , I thought ; perhaps she is a witch , like her namesake . The king spoke . " Think you your father of Glendower is alive still ? " " Sire , " said Morgan , " all Wales believes it . . . . " " Where would he hide , do you think ? " She spoke slowly . " He has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are burned or confiscated , still those folk round in parts near would give him shelter , and none the wiser . . . I do not know . " She looked up at him where she had knelt before him , a fey look through her lashes , very Welsh . " And if I knew I could not tell . . . . Would you have your daughters lead Owento you if it were the other way around ? " The king almost smiled , though it hurt his face , opening the sore places , and was not his habit lately ; her answer had pleased him , for the words were fair spoken and the thought bold . " Your tongue wags almost as free as my fool 's , mistress , " spokep196the king . " You have not met , I think , Sir Hercules there is nothis like in Wales " A look , almost of mischief , flitted over hisbloated features . " Will you not give my fool the kiss of courtesy ? " I heard the prince 's breath hiss in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood looking down at me for a moment , her face grave . " I am something tall , Master , I am sorry for it , " she said and , stooping , laid a cool kiss on my forehead , " but I give you greeting . " The breath caught in my throat for a moment ; I had not beforefelt the touch of a woman 's lips . I summoned strength then , after , and gave her all I had to give , rocking back on my heels and pretending to peer up , up into the clouds , squinting . " You are a very giantess , Mistress "  --  I bowed low , my hand over my heart " like the rest of this naughty world . . . . " She laughed again , low and sweet , delight in her face . " You are a fine mime , sir . I like you well . . . . " " He can dance , and tumble , too , our little brother , " said the king . " And his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You sing , too , sir ? Like a bard ? " " Like a bird , Lady ! " I cried , rolling my eyes to heaven , as in rapture . When I saw her smile again , I flapped my arms , runningabout the room and leaping high . It is a dancer 's trick , the legs spread in such a way the body seems to soar for a second . She clapped her hands , swaying . " Oh , Harry I never thought to laugh again ! " She turned tothe prince , he taking her hands . The king rose , his armor making a harsh and grating sound where the edges rubbed . " You are too thin , Lady , to laugh . . . you will break . " Never had I heard him jest before ; the joke creaked , but still it was something . " We must put back on your bones some of the meat we have starved off " " Oh , sire , " she said , " I am always hungry and yet the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very little only but every hour . . . " She looked at him questioningly . " Do you speak true . . . ? " He nodded . " We had a Greek doctor when I was on crusade . There were many cases of siege stomach . " And so the king went on , like a very lecturer , explaining the uses of broth and watered wine , taken in mouthfuls frequently to replace the lost body moisture , and so forth , I have forgot thep197rest . But she listened attentively , though it was plain she was near to dropping , and she thanked him at the end . She said then , clasping her hands in front of her and with an air of entreaty , " Oh , sire , do not be offended  --  but for your face there is a certain moss with rare fine healing properties . . . my father swore by it for all wounds and raw places . It would heal your face quick and clean . Many times I have seen it work , even with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognizeit well . . . . " He shook his head . " Oh , no , Mistress , I have had enough of liniments and such from my lady-wife . Some itch and some burn , and all smell evilly . No more ! " He made to take leave but turned . " It was a kind thought all the same , child . . . . " We left them then , she seeming to swoon a little into the prince 's arms , and he catching her up most tenderly . After , in the king 's own apartments , he sat musing while I fingered my lute ; a string was faulting and had to be replaced . He spoke suddenly . " I thought to find a wild beauty Owen was a man right goodly and fair . She is like a mangy yellow cat , and yet she is a . . . beckoning sort , for all her sad looks . . . . " " I think , master , " I said , trying my lute softly , " that her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . what would you , after eight months of siege ? "  |p198I  did not see the Lady Morgan of Wales for some time after , or the prince either ; he had taken her to his own castle of Monmouth , ever his favorite , to keep Christ 's mass in the country . Whether it was the regular small sups of broth and wine or the winter-frosted air or just time itself , which has ever a soft touch on the young , I know not ; but magic was wrought there . When next I saw the lady , she was like a great golden topaz . The king keeping to his bed after a bout of his recurrent malady , I was summoned to Prince Henry 's house for the last great festival before Lent , to entertain the company . I traveled by barge with the musicians , to avoid the streets filled with all mannerof ruffians and cutthroats on this night . As we rounded the bend that led to the mansion of Coldharbour , I took one look behind me whence I had come . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside my sick master 's bed ; his queen was in the north with all her ladies . Almost I wished to go back , for my heart ached for the lonely sick creature there , lying in his own abominations . It was a bootless thought , for he liked none about him when he lay in such wise , preferring to suffer unseen . I turned forward again , seeing on the water the brilliant reflection of thousands of candles from the prince 's house . It was a sad contrast , and I fell to musing of youth and age , vigor and weakness , joy and pain , till we drew up to the landing stage . The whole house blazed with light , and young evergreen branches were hung all about , their odor , faint , resinous , in the air . In the dining hall , a musicians ' gallery had been newly erected and under it a place cleared for dancing ; fires burned at each end , the green logs crackling . It was a small company ; the prince 's brothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the laughing , dark-eyed girl who was the mother of his bastard son . Tom had just passed his twentiethbirthday and looked younger , yet he had been wedded for full two years . His wife was Margaret Holland , widow of his uncle John of Beaufort ; she was older than he and plain  --  he sawp199her but seldom . He had married her for the great Beaufort inheritance , but it was tied up and untouchable , by her husband 's will , and the Lancaster greed thus thwarted . The prince , it was said , had deemed it a right good joke on Tom ; the brothers had ever been at odds , since boyhood . Tom had now the title of Duke of Clarence , and fine manors of his own , with a wing to himself in his father 's palace . He was already three-quarters flown with wine , his face flushed and his doublet stained . He sat between the Lady Morgan and his own doxy ; he did not seem to note much difference between them , for he pawed at first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , frowning , leave his place by Morgan 's side and speak to his brother , leading the pair to a low dais away from the table , where Tom collapsed , laughing , and his lady curled up on the floor , her head on his knees . The other young sons of the king were there , too , bright-eyed in the candle blaze , John talking with one of the musicians , and Humphrey at a small table with the mansion 's owner , Sir WilliamPoultney . This man I eyed curiously , when he did not see , for , though not young , he was got up like a fair maiden . His locks fell curling onto his shoulders , a style that has gone out among men , and his brows plucked into a thin , high arch . His voice , too , when I heard it , was something high and thin , and his clothes were peacock fine . There were two others at that table , playing at cards ; I recognized Lord Scrope , another of the same cut of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even from a little distance I could see that young Humphrey teased these half-men mercilessly , his narrow eyes alive with malice . It was plain they were flattered by the Lancaster attention , preening themselves and tittering , waving their hands about ; they were born courtiers . At the prince 's table , besides Morgan , there was the poet Hoccleveand Geoffrey Chaucer 's son Tom . Lewis Allen was with them , too , he that kept the famous inn in the Vintry . This was not a true inn but a fair manor where lads of noble birth stayed as guests , though they paid for their keep . Lewis Allen was a small , dark Welshman , his estates impoverished by the wars , though he had remained neutral . This manor of his furnished him now with his only livelihood ; he exacted his rents gracefully and kept a fine staff and table . London property was sky-high ; even young men rich in lands outside could not afford houses of their own here , and Master Allen fared well and was even be/coming famous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , too , when they were in London . We had much fine entertainment that night , beside my own ; the musicians had learned some Welsh songs in compliment to Morgan , and the poets read from their latest works . After , there was dancing , and I could rest and eat my supper . I watched the Lady Morgan where she danced with the prince ; it was a marvelous fine change in this lady . Her hackedoffhair had grown somewhat , and the mass of it in the back was caught up in a pearled net , a fashion I had not seen before . The lady , indeed , made her own fashion , for she wore her own strongly marked brows and no paint on her cheeks ; it was a startlinglook at first , but pleasant . She had put on flesh , too , but pleasingly , and was narrow-waisted and tall . Her saffron gown she had made herself , for Prince Henry had no money for needlewomen . It was a good velvet though , supple and glowing , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except a scarlet lining to the sleeves . She wore no jewels , only one large ring in the Lancastercolors , made of emeralds and sapphires , but needed none , her beauty itself clear cut and jewel-like , once one had become used to it . The prince did not leave her side and seemed , indeed , to hang on her words ; I had never seen him so . Many of the company danced , but much merriment was afoot , for the space was small , and the dancers jostled one another as they trod the wider measures . There were not enough lady partnersto go around , and Sir William paired with Lord Scrope , though that might have happened anyway , considering the temperamentof those gentlemen . Tom sprawled still on his low couch , his lady with him , laughing and teasing . At a lull in the music , when the dancers ' feet were still , and they stood panting and flushed , her voice rose , berating Tom in fun . " Tom Tom you are a villain . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I will have no no 's , either ! " And she took the ends of her silken girdle , beating him softly with it about the face and neck . " Let be ! " he cried . " You tickle ! " And he turned over , burying his face into the pillow . " I have no monies either . . . Harry is the only rich one hereabouts , as any can see . . . . " Morgan called out from where she stood and pulled off thep201pretty thing from her head , letting the yellow hair tumble as it would . " Here . . . have mine , Frances . I can make another in an afternoon . They are not real pearls anyway but French paste . . . . For fourpence , you may buy a trunkload ! " " I will lend you the fourpence , " cried the prince , " for just this morning I borrowed a whole shilling from my cook ! " " Netting pearls is an easy thing , too , " said Morgan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can do it well and she dislikesneedlework and does it only for a penance . . . . " At this the woman Alice looked up from some seam she was sewing and smiled ; I thought it a shame she did not do so more often . This was another survivor of the Harlech siege ; Morgan had begged Harry to bring her from the Tower where she was kept , for she had been Morgan 's tirewoman for some seven years . She went always in black , though she was young yet , or a drab brown , with her hair hidden under a tight white coif , like a very nun ; at her waist there hung a plain wooden crucifix . The prison pallor was still on her face , and it was puffy , as though she slept ill , but her features were well made and pleasing . There had been tales of this woman , how her mother had been burned as a witch , and she herself been a very wanton among all the soldiers of Grey , and had been converted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pious now as a holy anchorite . Some truth there must have been , for she was the widow of Walter Brut of Hereford , a famous Lollard , and for sure his teachings must have rubbed off on her . Morgan , it was plain , had much affection for this woman , treating her more as friend than servant . Morgan went on , a remembering look on her face , " Do you mind , Alice , when you first came to us at Glyndyvrdwy Llyys and could not thread a needle , and the Argyllwyddes set you to matching pearls and stringing them ? " Tom , who had been listening , in a foggy way , gave a loud laugh then , saying , " The Argyllwyddes ! What is that ? " " A lady I knew once , good and kind she was . . . and dead now . . . . " And Morgan turned away , her face still and grave , and picked up a mandol that lay upon a table . There was a little silence , for Morgan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her way , she was more royal than either of the Henrys . After a little , the prince came to her where she stood , fingering the music piece . " I can not seem to get the hang of this , " she said ,  | " though I understand the lute well and some harp knowledge I have too  --  " " It is the left hand that does the work , " said the prince . " Look , I will show you  --  " And their two heads , fair and dark , bent above the mandol , while the hum of voices rose again in the hall . It was late in the evening , many of the guests had taken their leave , and those few left were quiet or , like Tom , asleep ; there came a loud knocking at the Chepeside door . " It is Oldcastle , " cried the prince . " Let him in , before he spoils my new door-paint ! " I had a fine curiosity toward this knight , Sir John Oldcastle he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was the prince 's good friend . Some said he had tutored Henry while he read briefly at Oxford Town , others that he was a mere drinking companion ; for sure he had fought under the prince in the Welsh wars and was named a brave knight . A wily thinker he was named , too , having studied law and taught it , too . Many times he had been up for his Lollard beliefs , but no judge could outwit him , though all knew him guilty . There was a mort of hereticbelievers behind this man , too ; some say his influence spread all over the land , even in the northern parts and Scotland . All men knew , too , that he operated a kind of escape route to Wales for all those who wished to avoid persecution or trial , though nothing could be proved against him . This man must be brave knight , indeed , I thought , for he enteredall alone , having come through the London streets without retainer or bodyguard , a thing none other would dare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his middle years , something broad of girth , too , with a bearing that was both genial and arrogant , like a homely god . His head was large and square , topped by a crown of close-curling hair , red as flame . There was high color in his cheeks , too , as round as apples , and his eyes burned blue from clear across the hall ; he was known in the taverns as Painted Jack , for the English commons love nicknames . He , too , like the woman Alice , wore a plain wood cross ; I thought it must be a badge of their faith . He bowed to the Lady Morgan , saying that all men could see whose loins she had sprung from . " She is his image , Harry  --  you do not fear to keep your old enemy 's stamped coin about you ? "  | " She is my talisman , Jack . Besides she loves me well . " And the prince put his arm about Morgan , drawing her to him . " They say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his blue eyes keen as a sword . " And that he will come again . What say you ? " " I think not , sir , " she answered , her own eyes not giving ground . " I have heard that he lives , and so I hope  --  but I think he will not fight more . My father is a man of peace he wasdrawn into this conflict . . . . " " So he says , " Oldcastle remarked . " Owen I know from our youthful days he was double-tongued even then  --  doubletonguedas the Greek Apollo . . . . " " I think you err , Sir Knight  --  my father 's mind has many parts and not one only ; he saw ever both sides of a question . It is his greatness , to my mind . " She finished quietly . He looked closely at her . " To most men , " he said , " it is singlemindednessthat is the virtue . . . . " " What most men ' think is never right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel only , like animals or it may be , like one greatanimal that runs and hides , or springs and kills . A mob is ever mindless , whether it be behind you in battle or facing you with spear and sword . " A little flush had come up in her face , warmingits beauty . The prince spoke , quickly . " Ah- but if one mind rules  --  oneleader at their head  --  there lies the greatness of man ! " " No , Harry , " Morgan said , shaking her head , " men must not be bent to one will , like a herd of bulls led on to charge . Such a leader uses the baser part of people for his own glory ! " The prince smiled ; he loved her well . " But , sweetheart  --  even as a woman you must see , " he said , with sweet reasonableness , " a battle-force must have a leader . . . . " " I think , " she said slowly , " there should in truth be no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , indulgently , bending toward her . " " There speaks the soft woman 's heart , knowing nothing of these things  --  " " No , Harry , by my faith , she argues well ! " cried Oldcastle . " Mistress , I read you well . It is that you have no patience with these men 's wars and would see them gone from the earth . . . . "  |p204A  little smile played then about his lips , as he looked down at her . " What other game , then , Lady , would you give us in its place ? " " You have a keen wit , sir . It is true I think wars are a grisly game . . . . If I remember right , " she said , her glance stabbing him , " the doctrines you hold by teach as I speak also . Do you not hold that all men are brothers and that there should be peace on earth and goodwill to men ? " The prince broke in . " You have the words wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goodwill ' . . . . " That is the Latin the other is translated from the Greekwords which came earlier , " said Morgan . " The apostles wrote in Greek . Besides , it does not make sense in the Latin . God does not mince words or make conditions . His peace must be for all , or it is no peace . " " In truth , Harry , you have a very Minerva here . Did you not know ? " Oldcastle looked sidelong at Henry ; there was some irony in his eye . " Why , sweetheart , " said Henry , " I did not know you Lollard . . . see that you do not speak so in my father 's presence . . . . " " No , Harry , I am not Lollard , " Morgan said , her brows drawn together as if she struggled with her thought , " I am not Lollard either for I think in time they too will make wars to provethemselves right . . . . " Oldcastle was silent then and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , heavily . " It is the nature of man . . . . " There was an uneasy shifting of feet then and some clearing of throats among those that were left , for all could sense a web of tension . " Bring ale ! " the prince called , loud . " Or will it be malmsey , Jack ? You must be dry after our dry talking . . . . " Oldcastle roused himself . " Good brown ale ! " he cried . " A pitcher to myself I 'll have  --  a mighty thirst sits on me , it is true  --  good brown ale ! " " Will you have a pasty , sir ? There is a fine hare pie , " Morgan said . He clapped his hands , laughing loud . " I will have everything that is left ! " " Let us have music , too , " said Henry . " Soft music  --  so as not to wake my brother . " And he went to the musicians ' gallery . Morgan led the portly knight to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food there . He picked up a leg of capon , tearing at it with his teeth . Through his chewing , he spoke . " Lady , I wish you all happiness , for I think you love our princelingwell as indeed , in some wise , I do myself . . . . " He swallowed , and took a long drink of ale , then spoke again . " But knowhim well , this prince or he will cause you pain " and hepointed the drumstick at Henry where he lounged at ease among the music stands --  --  " he has much regard for you . And many of the sweeter things , like music , he loves , and fine-spoken words , but nothing in this life does that young man love so much aswar .... "  |p206That  spring the Lady Catherine of Wales and Mortimer died in the Tower . She had been cured of the plague , if indeed she had ever had it , but she wasted  --  after , coughing and spitting blood and growing ever weaker . Her little son Edmund followed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gardens for weeks . Ugly rumors were about concerning both deaths , as alwayshappens in such cases ; the smoke of that fire existed , of course , for the little heir of Mortimer was , in fact , closer blood to the throne than the Lancasters . It is a dark thought , and I , for one , did not credit it , though many did . The true Mortimer heir had been confined in the Tower for years , ever since Richard 's fall , so it booted little , to my mind , to let him live , while killing the next claimant . After , there were many plots against the royal family , for there was much sympathy for the Morfimers and even for the Lady of Wales . None came to any great threat though , for they were discovered in time . One only was a close call and might have proved successful . In the prince 's Coldharbour mansion , in dead of night , while he lay sleeping , an assailant , who had been concealedbehind the bed hangings , grappled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The prince , thrashing about in the bed , fighting for breath , woke the Lady Morgan beside him , and she , with great presence of mind , reached out to a tablewhere stood a heavy candlestick and , miraculously in thedark , brought it down on the right head . It broke the fellow 's skull , and he died instantly . On his person were found tracts of the New Learning , a wooden cross , and other evidence of Lollardy ; it was assumed that he was a poor madman , though none knew his face . The prince made much of this incident , telling all who would listenof the lady 's bravery . The king too showed much gratitude ; in the way of old tales , he asked her to name her reward . It did not turn out as in the stories though , for she asked a full pardon for her father of Glendower and freedom for her brother Mere/dith , still in the Tower , and this he refused to grant , sending her instead a girdle embroidered in gold . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the prince had been sent with his brothers into Scotland to put down a rebellion there . Such skirmishes were sporadic in that part of the realm and in Ireland , too , though never were they the concertedefforts which had occurred in Wales . The king was too ill to travel , much less command troops , so his sons assumed many of his duties , particularly Henry , who had much experience . The commons loved him , too , as I have said , for his victories and for the goodliness of his person , and demanded him for many public tasks . He sat in the king 's council , presiding over it much of the time also . I saw the lady often then , for the prince begged me for her entertainment while he was away ; almost every afternoon I sat with her , playing and singing , making up new songs . Some mastery of the mandol she learned then from me , though she had indifferent skill for music . She had a way with words though , this lady , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verses and bold and not in the fashion , but , to my mind , they were possessed of much merit . Also , when we were alone , she would mime for me , though she rarely did this in company . She was able to take all manner of parts , old crones and gruff soldiers and could mimic the king and Joanna most cruelly . If I could have laughed , I would have then , with her , for they were merry sketches indeed , and for my sight alone . I thought it shame and told her so , that she was not born a boy , for she would have made her fortune in all the courts of Europe . We sat one day in the small solar , she all in mourning white for her sister , and played together a duet , a song we had been practicing against the prince 's return . Her woman Alice , who had been marketing with two pages , came in , her step quick . Her cheeks , too , were red as I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pages from her with the market baskets , to bring them to the cook , and flung herself to her knees before the lady where she sat . " Oh , mistress , " she cried , " they live ! They live ! Our husbands live ! " Then she raised her hands to her burningface and sobbed , the tears running down between her fingers . This woman had been the wife of Walter Brut , the Lollard , who had been taken at the battle of Usk long ago ; the lady 's hus/band , too , one Rhisiart ab Owen , had been taken , he that was secretary to Owen . It was thought that all those prisoners had been put to death in the last reprisals of the war ; but Alice spoke between her sobs , and shakily , of new word she had received . These Lollards , like all outlawed sects , have many secret ways of communicating ; there is an underground web , insidious and spreading wide , that brings all news from one to the other so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is not known to all . Much has been done to smoke out these lines of communication , but it is in vain ; they are seldom caught either , for there are no informers among them . She told a harrowing tale , indeed , of hardship and long years of captivity and , in the end , miraculous escape . The dungeons at Usk had been crammed full with Welsh prisoners ; they had been overlooked all this time , though in other places all the prisoners had been executed without right of ransom . Sometime in the last year , though , an order had been given for their disposal , for the crown no longer gave any funds to that prison , and there was no way to keep the wretched creatures , even on bread and water . If they two went free , indeed , it was a very miracle , for one out of each three had been summarily butchered , the rest being released . They had been lined up and counted off ; those who went free had to make their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they might receive succor . The Lady Morgan listened with a face white and strained ; no flush came to her cheeks , and when Alice 's recital was finished , her mistress ' eyes had a troubled look . " And they live , both , and are well ? " Morgan asked , low . " So I believe , " answered Alice . " Oh , mistress , it is a true mira-cle ! " " You believe . . . you will not tell me where you have learned this ? " " Oh , mistress I can not ! " And the poor creature started weepingafresh . " But it is sure ? " " Yes it is sure . . . . They live . I even know where they are tobe found . " And her eyes slewed around to me , for these Lollards trust few men . " You will tell me presently , " said Morgan , putting aside herp209mandol and walking from us to the window , where she stared out into the warm May afternoon . The woman Alice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips moving silently . She raised her head and spoke to the Lady Morgan . " Oh , mistress  --  is it not a very miracle ? " " For they two yes " said Morgan slowly . " But what of thoseother men cut down ? " " Aye , mistress I will pray for their souls . . . . " Morgan came over to the woman where she knelt , cupping her hand under Alice 's chin and forcing her to look into her eyes . " Alice , who gave such an order ? Who made that grisly lottery ? " Alice 's eyes flicked away , as if she could not bear to look upon the lady . " Mistress , I am sorry , " she whispered . " They say . . . it was the prince . " The Lady Morgan did not speak for a moment ; I saw her knuckles go white among the folds of her gown , where she clutched it suddenly . " Yes , " she said , turning away , " it has the Lancaster smell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I think , Lady , he meant to show mercy . . " " They can not deal out half-mercies , " said Morgan , her face dark as I had not seen it . " They can not to get on the right sideof their God . . . . " " My Lady , " I said , for it pained me to see her so , " my master of Lancaster would have pardoned none . . . . " She looked at me . " Yes  --  perhaps , " she said , her face clearing of its dark humors . " You can not bring up a cub in a wild beast 's den and expect it to turn into a lamb . Harry has known nothing but war since he was fourteen . . . " She sighed . " Yet does he think himself ever in the right . . . . " She looked at me with a sad little smile . " Withal , the king has been a kind master to his fool , Little Brother . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me of her love for the prince , how she had yearned for him all the years of the wars , never thinking to encounter him more . " And Rhisiart that Iwas wedded to never did we two love nor was I less than a maidwhen first I came here  --  for he went away to battle scarce an hour after we exchanged vows . I thought him captured at first ; then we heard they were all dead in that battle . . . I do not wishp210him unalive , for we were good friends , but this news makes all unclear . " Her brows were knitted together in thought , and her face wore a look of trouble . " I have vowed wifehood . . . and I know not where my duty lies now , for the prince is my only true lord . Yet do we stand at odds often and often , when we are private strivingeach for our own convictions . And then , I cannever be wife to Lancaster , were I free , for I am base-born . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall in front of us wantingno answer and so I gave none ; indeed there was none that Icould see , for it was a pretty coil that she was in , between these two men . She went apart from me then , dismissing me , I think to weep ; never did that lady show weakness in front of other folk . It was the first hint that I had that all was not perfect love betweenPrince Henry and his leman , but not the last . Often and often , after that , I heard sharp notes in their two voices when they spoke and ill accord in their words . Perhaps , after that day , I was looking for it , or perhaps their disagreements grew . I do not know . Often I heard the lady upbraid him , albeit gently , for his surly tempers toward his ailing father , deeming him unkind and intolerant ; in this was she inconsistent , for she ever hated Lancaster and held him usurper and worse . Truly , all folk have their faults , even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her fair and just . She tried also to make peace between the royal brothers , for she had a fondness for poor gay Tom , as did all females . There was too much rivalry of long years ' standing between the brothersand too little of common tastes , so nothing was gained on that score ; indeed , the prince seemed to take her partisanship righthardly and baited Tom the more . As for Oldcastle , his great friend , the lady leaned toward Lollardyanyway , or so I privately thought ; ht ; heavy arguments were afoot whenever this knight was present , for he could never hold his peace on points of doctrine , and the prince grew daily more intolerant of this sect . He did not sanction the persecutions and burnings though but held , like his uncle of Beaufort , that persuasionshould be used of a gentler sort . But it was on the question of war and battle that the lady fought the hardest ; I think she hoped to convince her lover of peace 's virtues , but war was bred in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He talked often , his eyes kindling , of the English claims in France , the lady contending that there were none such . " Who is it you are looking to become , " she would cry scornfully , " Charlemagne or that cruel boy of the ancients , Alexander , who laid waste half a world for the name of conqueror ? Ever have I marked , " she said , " how you must be victor always , , even in a play-game ! What is it burns in you ? For in you it is  --  you think not of England 's good , but of yourself only . . . . " " I would have England greater than any , " he answered . " But it will not be so ; you will beggar the realm . " She spoke with quieter tongue then , and with sweet reasonableness . " Can you not see , Harry , how it will be ? War is costly . My father of Glendower was wealthy beyond any Lancaster dream yet is hestripped of all now and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . " " God will be on my side . It will not happen so with me . . . . " " Oh , Harry , your head is thick as English yew ! " And scorn crept back into her voice , for she held her own powers of mind most high . " Each army holds that God is on its side , and fearful things are done in His Name . He can not be on all sides . In truth , I think He is not on any for what God would sanction slaughter and pillage ? " The prince 's face would grow most dark , for he did not brook contradiction , but after , he would shrug it off and woo her with fair words . I think he persuaded himself that her thoughts were but a woman 's piddling fears ; this was not so . The lady had been reared more scholar than maid ; she was a thinker of great subtletyand could quote all the old books besides . It was not always so between them , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet did these discords presage the end , for the end did come.
