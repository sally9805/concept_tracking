txt The Social Democrats won an impressive victory today in the Bremen election , giving Chancellor Willy Brandt 's ruling party its first real triumph in a , state contest since he took power in Bonn two years ago . Led by the popular young Hans Koschnik , the Bremen Social Democrats gained more than 55 per cent of the vote . This was an increase of 10 percentage points above 1967 , the year of the last election in West Germany 's smallest state . Mr. Koschnik , as president of the Senate , Bremen 's executive body , is the head of the local government . The Social Democrats have ruled in the ocean-oriented city-state since the end of the war , most of the time in coalition with the small Free Democratic party . But the Free Democrats broke away from the coalition last May , arguing that the Social Democrats were fostering the development of a " Red " university in Bremen . Rivals Make Common Cause Thereafter , the Free Democrats made common cause with the Christian Democrats against Mr. Koschnik 's " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harsh clarity that the overwhelming majority of Bremen 's 558,000 voters had not swallowed the Red-scare propaganda of the Free Democrats and Christian Democrats . The Christian Democrats got only a little more than 30 per // cent of the vote , which was less than in their showing in the 1969 federal elections , The Free Democrats sank to about 7 per cent , a loss of 3 percentage points . The two radical parties in the contest , the German Communist party on the left and the National Democratic party on the right , suffered sharp setbacks and neither will be represented in the 100-member Bremen Par-liament , Four year ago , the National Democrats , whose leaders in. cluded some old and some new ' Nazis , got almost 9 per cent of the vote and eight seats in the Parliament . Today they got only 3 per cent , failing to hurdle the 5 per cent minimum necessary for seats in Parliament . Similarly , the Communists , who got a bit more than 4 per cent four years ago , sank to 3 per cent this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In this respect , also , the Bremen election continued West Germany 's virtually uninterrupted movement toward a two ? party system that has been in process for more than five years . Koschnik Is Credited Political observers in the andent Hansa trading port attributed the victory in large part to Mr. Koschnik , a vigorous 42-year-old Bremen native who , Bremen believes , has headed the state Government with verve and imagination . Instead of yielding to demands that he oppose the reformist plans of a group of young leftwing academics for the city 's new university , which is to open Thursday , Mr. Koschnik stood up for reform . The election results plainly vindicated Mr. Koschnik and the rector of the new university , Thomas von Der Vring , 34 years old , who had nettled Bremen conservatives by hiring professors who were avowed Marxists . For his part , Mr. Koschnik modestly attributed his victory to the " peace policy " of Chancellor Brandt , who provided some last-minute campaign assistance in a swing through the harbor areas from Bremen to Bremerhaven Friday night . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Brandt talked about domestic policies , but applauded when he defended his policy of seeking " understanding " with Communist Europe . For Mr. Koschnik , the victory is to be followed by another satisfaction . He plays host in Bonn tomorrow to the visiting Emperor Hirohito of Japan , in place of the ailing Federal Presi ? dent , Gustav Heinemann . In West Germany 's Federal system , the heads of state governments rank after the Federal . President and this month it is Mr. Koschnik 's torn to fill in . When lie returns from Berm , he will have the delicate job of deciding whether to readmit the Free Democrats to a coalition in Bremen parallel to the federal coalition in Bonn . He was noncommittal on this tonight . With more than half the vote counted at 9 P.M. , it appeared that the Social Democrats would hold 59 of the Bremen Parliament seats , the Christian Democrats , 34 , and the Free Democrats , 7.                   @ @
