Some venturesome souls achieve fame by scaling the world 's highest peaks or plumbing the oceans ' deepest bottoms . Their feats faithfully find their way into the Guinness Book of World Records , as do the odysseys of marathon smoke-ring blowers , balloonists , goldfish swallowers , grape eaters , yo-yo spinners , Scrabble players , prune devourers , face slappers , Pogo-stick jumpers , leapfroggers , barrel jumpers , needle threaders and record breakers in 10,000 other Record-worthy categories . For the past two weeks , in a guerrilla assault on Guinness , 200 young Californians assembled in Los Angeles to topple records or immortalize themselves and to discombobulate Recordkeeping . <P> They succeeded all too well . During the week-long oddball Olympics , contestants in 75 events set eleven new world records . John Parker , 24 , made himself a 1975 edition Guinness notable by downing 300 goldfish , 75 more than the previous oldie goldie . Rick Sumner , 14 , polished off 20 doughnuts in 9 min. 59 sec. , beating the old record of 20 in 15 min . John McKinney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crammed 52 cigars into their mouths and kept them alight for 30 sec. ( v. the previous record of 28 lit for 30 sec . ) . Another titlist , Scott Case , managed to smoke 110 cigarettes simultaneously for 30 sec. without endangering his health . Kevin Farrell and Corey Fletcher each stood on one leg for 7 hr. , 60 min. longer than anyone ever has before . <P> Allan Littman , 17 , consumed a pound of grapes , with seeds , in 52 sec. to crush the old mark of 65 sec . Allan Greenberg , 22 , twirled a record album on his forefinger for 5 hr . Bruce Stewart and Robert Argust slapped each other 's faces for 31 hr. to top the old record by one hour . Frank Dolce blew 116 smoke rings on one drag to break the old high by 30 . <P> For many Guinness busters , it was not all goldfish and chips . Three weary young high school students , in the middle of their 35th game of Monopoly and six hours ahead of the previous record , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's extremely boring . " Three other young titlists came better prepared . Setting their own private record for unicycle riding ( 50 hr. ) , they brought along Johnson 's baby powder to alleviate what they called " diaper rash " and kept happy in the saddle for a record 50 by playing cards , Ping Pong and pool . <P> One oddball hero was Roger Guy English , 23 , who claims to hold world marks for twisting , staying awake and kissing . His most serious attempt at record breaking will take place in August when he begins a 1,876-mile swim down the Mississippi River from Ford Dam , Minn. , to New Orleans , which he has to do in fewer than 176 days . <P> Representatives of the Guinnesses , the Anglo-Irish beerage nobility who publish the Book of Records , which they claim is the world 's biggest-selling volume after the Bible , were not all that amused by the heroics in Los Angeles . They will have to update the Book of Records-and now that just about every record in existence is open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and frequent revisions .
