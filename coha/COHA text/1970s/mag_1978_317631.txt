A tumultuous trial ends-and the killing continues <P> Not in recent times , if ever , had an Italian trial been conducted in such an atmosphere of fear and intimidation . <P> Less than a month after Renato Curcio , founder of Italy 's notorious Red Brigades , and 45 other defendants were brought to trial in Turin in 1976 on charges of subversion and other crimes , Genoa Chief Prosecutor Francesco Coco was gunned down . One of the defendants announced in court that the murder was committed by brigatisti , and the trial was postponed . Then , shortly before the court was to convene again a year later , Fulvio Croce , president of the Turin Bar Association and newly appointed chief defense counsel , was murdered . Once again , the trial was postponed . Finally , last March the proceedings resumed . Despite yet another murder , of a police inspector who had helped apprehend one of the defendants , Judge Guido Barbaro vowed that the trial would go on . <P> So it did . Last week after nearly four months of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two-woman jury . which under Italian law was joined by Barbaro and his assistant judge , returned its verdict . It acquitted 16 of the defendants , ordered a new trial for one and found 29 guilty ; Curcio , 37 , got the maximum sentence : 15 years . <P> Throughout the trial , the 15 defendants in custody ( 26 were free on their own recognizance , five are still at large ) , kept up an emotional tirade against the judge , the jury and their own defense counsel . But when Judge Barbaro read the verdict , as more than 800 carabinieri and other police ringed the courthouse , the defendants were absent from the steel-barred cage in which they had been kept during the proceedings . They had all elected to remain in their cells as a protest against what they called a " court of the regime . " <P> The defendants who were in custody made no pretense of innocence . In a final statement , read by four of the defendants , they told the court that all those on trial were militant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibility for every one of its past , present and future actions . " The kidnap-murder of former Premier Aldo Moro this spring by other Red Brigades terrorists , declared one of the defendants , was " a leap forward of high quality . " Even as the jury was deliberating , two gunmen followed former Antiterrorist Squad Chief Antonio Esposito , 36 , onto a Genoa bus and shot and killed him before horrified passengers . They then drove off in the car of a waiting accomplice . Meanwhile , the police have had little to say about the progress of the Moro case itself since the arrest last month of six people who have been charged ( along with five others still at large ) with complicity in Moro 's assassination .
