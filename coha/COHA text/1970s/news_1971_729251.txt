txt IThe proportion of black families headed by women in'creased sharply in the nineteensixties to a level three times that of whites . This widening difference , disclosed in new Census Bureau survey data , is regarded by the authorities as a strong signal of continuing deep poverty and social deterioration among many black families . Nationally , according to the new survey , about 27 per cent of Negro families were headed by women in 1970 . This compares with 22 per cent in 1960 and 17 per cent in 1950 . The white figure has hovered at 9 per cent throughout the period . However , new data also suggested that long-term black increases have leveled off . While analysts say it is too early to pronounce a definite trend , the figure has now remained at 27 per cent for three straight years . In New York City , new figures from the 1970 census show , the number of black families headed by women increased from 81,000 to 127,000 in the decade . They now constitute 33 per cent of all black families , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Families headed by women in both races are often as stable as those with both parents present . But they are more likely , to be poor , and their children more vulnerable to delinquency , premarital pregnancy and crime , . experts in the field say . Black families headed by ' women are likely to be the poorest of all . And , experts say , their poverty is both a primary cause and result of the absence of the father . Earlier census data showed that the proportions of white and black families in poverty were almost exactly the same as the proportions of , families headed by women . About 8 per cent of white and 27 per cent of black families were in poverty in 1969 . " The failure to be able to provide for your family when that 's what society expects of you is an assault on your manhood , " says George Wiley , director of the National Welfare Rights Organization . " So it 's a natural reaction , when things get too tough to bug out . " Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , number of black children with only one ? parent  --  usually the mother  --  has continued to grow . In the , decade the number went up 1.3 million , to a total of 3.2 million . The parallel white gain was L2 million , to a 1970 total of 5.2 million . Impact Over Nation The effects of these changes are felt across the country . ? In Los Angeles , Juvenile Court Judge ' Marvin Freeman said , " I and all people who serve in the field are struck by the high percentage of delinquent , incorrigible and troubled children who come from broken homes . " ' In , Milwaukee , Judge George , Bowman said , " A boy going through .. puberty and with only a . mother has extreme problems . Sometimes he wilt commit crime 's and acts of aggression to show his masculinity . " In Bostoe , Katherine.O'Brian , assistant chief probation officer of the Juvenile Court , asserted . " The girls are difficult , too , at this age . They 're looking for love and interest and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give them any attention . " Across the country , the problems ? and the poverty ? are greatest among the 1.1-million black families , containing 3.1 million children , headed by women . Even where a husband-wife family is eligible for welfare , " the amount is so small it leaves the family in an extremely insecure , unstable , economic condition , " said Leonard Goodwin , a sociologist at the Brookings Institution in Washington . He added : " Why are so many of these families female-headed ? Because the male ca n't earn enough to support his family and so , he deserts . And I would argue that illegitimacy is part of the same point . Men who ca n't make it do n't marry . " Father in High Incomes This argument is supported by the census survey , which shows that the higher a family 's income , the more likely it is to have a father present . And at each higher income rung , the gap narrows between the black and white rates of families headed by women . The over-all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for blacks and 9 per cent for white . But among families with incomes of $10,000 or more , the totals drop to about 6 per cent for Negroes compared with about 3 per cent for whites . If a black father deserts his family , however , the mother is likely to have . a far harder time than her white opposite number . The total of black women who head households and take jobs is almost exactly the same as it is for their white counterparts  --  slightly more thank half of each group work . But , the black women who earn significantly less than whites . Nearly 60 per cent of such mothers earn less than $3,000 , compared with 30 per cent of white female family heads . " One simply ca n't find any white counterparts for the poorest black women with no , husbands around . They carry the double burden of being black and poor , " said Elliot Liebow , the author of " Tally 's Corner , " a noted study of poor young black men . . women . Several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressures on black husbands and potential husbands . Daniel Patrick Moynihan , former counselor to the President , has cited the high degree of urbanization among blacks , coupled with high rates of unemployment . Mr. Moynihan was the principal author of a highly controversial Federal report in 1965 on the " Tangle of Pathology , " centered on the weakness of black family structure . Another factor is the deadend quality of many jobs held by blacks , said Phillips Cutwright , senior research associate at the Harvard-Massachusetts Institute of Technology Joint Center for Urban Studies . " Even if a black and white worker make the same amount , " lie says , " the white 's income continues to grow over time . The black man 's does not . His dissatisfaction grows , and like other people who do n't feel good about what they 're doing , it spills over into the marriage . " Another economic factor identified by experts is larger , family size among many black families , the result of higher fertility rates among black women . Although both black and white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age groups bear more children ' than whites . Several authorities interviewed , however , discounted illegitimacy as a significant explanation for the large disparity between black and white households headed by women . While the black illegitimacy rate is far higher , they note , it has been dropping each year and the white rate has been increasing . This view is substantiated by the census survey data . The figures show that less than a quarter of the increased number of black children living with only one parent was accounted for by unmarried mothers . Several authorities also disJ counted the effect of , welfare and elimination of welfare regulations such as the one that prohibited payments to women with a " man in the house . " An inadequate income provided by the public , these authorities said , does no more to stabilize familie3 than an inadequate income derived from work , Still another explanation advanced is that poor households headed by women and concentrated in black ghettos breed more of the same .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
