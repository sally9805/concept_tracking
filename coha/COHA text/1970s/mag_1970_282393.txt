Traditionally barred from many occupations , the Jews of Europe 's ghettos gravitated for centuries toward dealing in money and jewelry . By World War II , roughly half of the diamond cutters and polishers in Antwerp and Amsterdam were Jewish . Those who managed to flee the Nazis took their skills with them . In the late 1930s , several hundred anguished but unbeaten refugees started the industry that today produces Israel 's chief export : polished diamonds . <P> It is an industry perfectly suited to the country 's scant resources . Diamond cutting and polishing require no water , little power , few fixed assets and only a small work space . The business generates handsome profits for Israel-20% is added to the value of stones by processing them . Diamonds also gain the foreign exchange that Israel 's deficit-ridden war economy badly needs . <P> Holding Prices Up . Last year Israel exported $216 million worth of polished diamonds , which ranked second in the world only to Belgium 's $250 million . This year the economic slump in the U.S. , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Moshe Schnitzer , the 49-year-old Israeli exporter who is president of the World Federation of Diamond Bourses , global sales have dropped by 30% so far in 1970 . But Israel has done better than its competitors because it concentrates on the smaller stones , about one carat or less , which are becoming the most popular ones , particularly in the U.S. and Japan . Israel 's gem exports have declined only 11% this year . <P> Diamond prices have not softened , partly because most raw diamonds are sold to cutters by the London-based Central Selling Organization . This group is controlled by South Africa 's Oppenheimer family through its De Beers company , of which the British and French Rothschilds are directors . The syndicate has a policy for holding up prices : it regularly increases them during times when world business is strong and during times of slump keeps stones in inventory rather than reduce prices . As a result , many investors continue to put their money into diamonds , which over the past five years have risen in value by 20% to 60% , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the syndicate for 42% of its diamonds , but it has developed other sources as well . Western but not capitalist , white but not colonial , skilled but not rich , the Israelis were able to find friends-and diamonds - in the Congo ( Brazzaville ) , Ghana , Sierra Leone , Liberia and the Ivory Coast . Israel even gets stones from Arabs ; Syrian and Lebanese diamond buyers in Africa secretly sell to Tel Aviv .
