The New York City Corrections Department did not classify the TV showing of The Godfather as a special event , but it turned into one . Just as the first segment of the four-part saga of the Corleone Mafia family began to get violent , the clock struck 10 p.m. , lockup time in the city 's jails . At the Queens House of Detention , 43 inmates protested and refused to go back into their cells , and extra guards had to be called to herd them to bed . <P> That incident led to second thoughts , and special-event status was conferred on the movie , permitting city prisoners ( virtually all 7,300 inmates as it turned out ) to stay out late if they wished to see the last two episodes-except the protesters , who were given nine days of confinement without privileges , an offer they could n't refuse .
