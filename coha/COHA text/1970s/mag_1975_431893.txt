 | the scenery for two different plays ? o about a decaying tenement neighborhood today 's Brooklyn , the other about a pre-Wor War II rural Jewish village , or shtetl , eastern Europe . The Pious Ones MAYBE we should have parachuted in . That would have seemed much more appropriate somehow for two travelers dropping out of one world into another . Instead , mundanely , photographer Nathan Benn and I took the subway , boarding on Manhattan 's lower East Side and emerging ten minutes later into a setting that looked for all the world as if some errant stagehands had mixed " Welcome to Williamsburg in Brooklyn . Nathan said . " Or to Satmar in old Hungary . It depends on how you look at it . " Passing shopwindows hieroglyphed with square-block Hebrew letters , we entered the  | extraordinary world of Williamsburg 's Hasidic Jews , or Hasidim ? meaning " pious ones . " Here , wedged amid Brooklyn 's ethnic hodgepodge , sprawls a 40-block enclave of ultra-orthodox Judaism , where most of the men wear flowing beards and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Book of Leviticus 19:2i : " Ye shall not round the corners of your heads , neither shalt thou mar the corners of thy beard . " Their clothing , derived from styles long worn by Jews in eastern Europe , is a striking study in monotone ? black or dark-toned suit , wide-brimmed black hat , white shirt buttoned at the neck , no tie . " It may seem plain to you , " one Hasid told me , " but to me it 's beautiful ! " On Sabbaths and holidays the married men don great sable-trimmed hats called shtreimels , giving them a noble , almost regal air as they stride along .  | The women , not limited to their menfolk 's color scheme , wear modish but distinctly modest garments as they push their baby carriages and strollers along Lee Avenue ( page 295 ) . Only after you 've been told are you likely to notice that most of them are wearing wigs . Often styled in the latest coiffure , these are worn to conceal their real hair ? which is cropped after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prescribed by a centuries-old tradition . Here , a single subway stop from Manhattan , children learn Yiddish as their native tongue , and rarely if ever see a television show or movie , or read a novel . Nor for that matter are they likely to drift into delinquency , experiment with drugs , or rebel against the value system of their elders . For here the mitzvahs , or commandments , which God on Mount Sinai charged His chosen people to obey , are honored as rules of living with a devotion so vibrant that the tablets of the law might have been carried down by Moses to Lee Avenue this very morning . To these Brooklyn streets after World War II came several thousand Hasidim , remnants of a widespread movement within Judaism that flourished in eastern Europe from the mid-1700 's until ? but only until ? the Nazi catastrophe . The survivors arrived in America and Palestine with blue concentration camp numbers tattooed on their forearms and the searing horror of Hitler 's death camps branded on their souls . HOPING TO GET A GLIMPSE of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Satmar Rebbe , Yoel Teitelbaum ? Nathan and I hurried to reach the Satmar bes medresh , or house of study and prayer , before sunset . Already a fireball sun had tangled itself in the cables of the nearby Williamsburg Bridge . Before us stretched an almost surreal perspective of venerable Brooklyn brownstones , their storefronts already shuttered against the gathering blue dusk of this fast-approaching Rosh Hashanah , the Jewish New Year . " A few minutes more on the subway and we 'd already have broken the law , " Nathan said . " The Jewish law , that is , against traveling or working on a Sabbath or religious holiday . For an Orthodox Jew to ride a subway or even to push the buttons on an elevator is forbidden . And put on your yarmulke , too . " He referred to the  | skullcap traditionally worn by Jews . " The Hasidim wear them all the time ? even when they 're sleeping . " I later inquired of a Hasidic acquaintance why he wore his yarmulke even when he went to bed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his respect for God , " he answered . " And ? tell me , please ? am I not still a Jew when I 'm sleeping ? " From the pocket of my coat I extracted a black skullcap and stopped before a shopwindow to position it on my head . At that moment a Hasidic lad , a beardless copy of his dark-clad elders , came to a sudden halt in front of me , eyebrows raised . " You should be ashamed ! " he admonished , his earlocks quivering . " Do you mean that you put on your yarmulke only after you 've gotten here ? Are you a Jew only when you 're in Williamsburg ? " Eyes flashing darkly , he hurried off down Lee Avenue . I shrugged with a sense of utter helplessness . It would not be the last time that the admittedly unorthodox quality of my own Jewishness would be brought into open question by zealously observant Hasidim . Though I had become bar mitzvah ? a " son of the commandment " or a " man of duty " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a synagogue since then . Certainly I had no sense of obligation to follow all of the multitude of mitzvahs , or commandments , that God had charged the Jews of Moses ' time to obey in fulfillment of their covenant with Him . To the Hasidim , however , these mitzvahs are as important today as they were in ancient times . No fewer than 613 such mitzvahs are enunciated in the five books of Moses comprising the Torah , or Pentateuch . They range fr the Ten Commandments and such sublime moral precepts as " thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself " to so technical a regulation as " neither shall a garment mingled of linen and woollen come upon thee . " These latter two mitzvahs , seemingly worlds apart in significance , appear in consecutive verses of the Book of Leviticus 18 , 19 ) . The Hasidim hew as strictly to latter as to the former . To heed and safeguard the 613 mitzvahs , plus literally thousands other laws and traditions that have evolved from them over the millenniums , becomes the very fulcrum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medresh , Nathan and I elbowed our way through a dense crowd of Hasidim toward a large inner doorway . Squeezing up as far as we could , we stood on tiptoe and peered into the main prayer hall , a great room into which . I later learned , some seven thousand people had been packed . All were utterly absorbed in prayer , faces adrip with mingled sweat and tears of ecstasy , lips murmuring impassioned prayers at a furious pace , bodies rocking and swaying and trembling with emotion ? turning that huge prayer hall into an echo chamber of the spirit reverberating with passion for God . The Satmar Rebbe himself , leading the prayers at the front of the room , was completely blocked from our view by adoring crowds of Hasidim . A Hasid later explained to me why he tries to get physically near the  | Rebbe : " The Rebbe 's soul , " he said , " is closer to God than other men 's . We get as near to him as we can so that our prayers will be carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a great flame . " Not until my next visit to Williamsburg did I actually get a clear view of the Rebbe . This was at the annual celebration of his escape from the Nazis , an observance combined with a fund raising for the Satmar parochial school system , which serves thousands of Hasidic children . Once again I found myself in the midst of a great crowd of Hasidim . All were amurmur with expectation of the Satmar Rebbe 's arrival . A sudden commotion erupted around a side entrance of the hotel ballroom where the celebration was being held . All eyes turned in that direction . Preceded by aides , who created an aisle for him through the vast throng , the Rebbe himself now entered ? a slender patriarch with flowing white earlocks and a graceful tuft of white beard curled on his black-suited breast like new-spun silk . His face , untouched by the pandemonium around him , radiated an almost visible glow of spirituality that seemed to be reflected in the faces of his disciples . At the sight of the revered tzaddik @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single body and exploded into a rhythmic wallrattling chant , which crescendoed until it seemed the room could contain not another decibel . At this point the Rebbe , with the slightest batonlike motion of one index finger , brought the runaway chorus of thousands to an instantaneous halt . Even the echoes seemed to die at once . Now , through the loudspeakers , came the Rebbe 's voice ? the merest pin-scratch on a slate of silence . Yet that parchment-thin , otherworldly voice was instantly compelling . His disciples , many rocking and swaying as if in prayer , hung on each word as he thanked God for liberating him from the Nazis and for enabling him to be here with his beloved Hasidim . He spoke of the crucial importance of educating their children in Hasidic schools and reminded them that charity , which made such education possible , was one of the noblest of virtues . He then sat back , a benign expression lighting his face , and allowed his aides to take over the fund-raising activities ( following pages ) . THERE WAS A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when the Rebbe ? now approaching 90 ? would have discoursed at greater length . His disciples recall how , on the Festival of Simchas Torah ? " Rejoicing in the Torah " ? he would dance for hours through the night with the holy Torah scroll cradled in his arms . " He 's as famed for his scholarship as for his saintliness , " one Hasid told me . " Once , when I was a boy , I climbed a tree outside his window to see if it was true he often studied all night long . Well , there he was , in the middle of the night , bent over a volume of the Talmud , his finger at his temple , studying . A true saint he is ! " If the adulation of his devotees seems somewhat extreme to the outsider , one must understand the pivotal importance of this charismatic man in both their private lives and their collective history .  | Long before World War II he was already a famed tzaddik in eastern Hungary , becoming spiritual leader of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a part of Romania , and spelled Satu Mare . This region came under the Nazi jackboot late in the war , by which time the vast majority of eastern Europe 's Hasidim ? perhaps 500,000 or more , no one knows even roughly how many ? had been systematically annihilated with millions of other Jews . Then , in 1944 , the Satmar Rebbe and his followers , along with most of the rest of Hungarian Jewry , were dispatched to death camps . Even in that living hell he and his Hasidim strove to fulfill what mitzvahs they could . One of the first cruelties inflicted by the Nazis was the shearing off of their beards and earlocks . The Rebbe , it is told , pretended to have a toothache and concealed both beard and earlocks beneath a large bandage . Miraculously , the Nazis took no notice . The bribing of Nazi officials enabled a trainload of Jews , including the Satmar Rebbe , to escape to Switzerland . Soon after , the Rebbe went to Jerusalem . There , however , his ideas failed to jibe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the yetunborn State of Israel . The government of the Promised Land , the Rebbe adamantly insisted , must be founded not by men but by the Messiah himself . To this day he declares that the present State of Israel usurps the soil of Zion and actually delays the coming of the Messiah . Such a militantly anti-Zionist attitude ? not shared by all groups of Hasidim ? has raised the blood pressure of many Israelis and pro-Zionist American Jews . LEAVING JERUSALEM in 1946 , the Sat- mar Rebbe came to the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn , already a bastion of American Orthodox Jewry that had become a haven for displaced European Jews after the war . Though many of Williamsburg 's newly arrived Hasidim had not been the Rebbe 's immediate disciples before the war , they found in his presence a spiritual magnetism that could pull together the shattered pieces of their lives . " When we arrived , " one Hasid told me , " we had nothing . We were dazed , hopeless , without any direction or center in our lives . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us that direction , gave us a center . He instilled in us a new hope and restored our belief in the world ? and in ourselves . " Starting from scratch , the Rebbe laid the foundations of a new Satmar Hasidic community ; its membership today numbers in the tens of thousands . Other Hasidic rebbes , too , settled in Williamsburg and nearby Brooklyn neighborhoods ? most notably the Lubavitcher Rebbe , whose following in Crown Heights has attracted thousands of American Jews . These Brooklyn communities and the various groups in Israel comprise the largest concentrations of Hasidim in the world . Transplanted to America , a new tree of faith began growing ? and blooming ? in the streets of Brooklyn . I once asked my Satmar friend Moishe Green : " Who will take the Rebbe 's place when , God forbid , he leaves this world ? " He answered : " We do n't think about it . Only the Messiah himself can replace so great a tzaddik as the Rebbe . My own belief is that , before the Rebbe leaves us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home to the Promised Land . " SUCH DEEP-SEATED BELIEF in the redeeming powers of Hasidic rebbes traces back to the 18th century to the founding father of Hasidism , Israel Baal Shem Tov , one of the most extraordinary and luminous figures in the millenniums-long history of Judaism . A poor and unpretentious man , a native of the Carpathian Mountain region , he brought to the poverty-wracked , pogrom-plagued Jewish masses of Poland and the Ukraine a spiritual message of transcendent joy and hope . Inveighing powerfully against the oftenarid emphasis on religious scholarship that had come to dominate Jewish spiritual life in his time , he proclaimed that even the most unlearned Jew could experience a direct communion with God through ecstatic worship and a truly joyful keeping of the mitzvahs . What mattered was not so much the loftiness of one 's intellect as the purity of one 's soul , however humble . Love of God , he taught , could be expressed as well through spontaneous singing and dancing as through formal prayer and scholarship . For a time this passionately mystic approach to religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some of the early Hasidim wer excommunicated . Yet the movement spread like holy  | wildfire , inflaming the hearts and mind- ut vast numbers of east European Jews , learned and unlearned alike . It was a genuine democratization of Jewish religious life , making the deepest spiritual experience accessible to the many as well as to the few . After the death of the Baal Shem Toy ? a title meaning , roughly , " Master of the Gold Name " ? his closest disciples established a number of Hasidic communities , where the fervor of his teachings continued to burn bright . These leaders became known by the title rebbe ? a designation not to be confused with rabbi , though both mean " my master " or " my teacher . " Any pious and learned man may become a rabbi , but only the rarest of individuals has the transcendent qualities required of a rebbe . IN TIME ? and this has often been criticized by outsiders ? the leadership of Hasidic communities became largely dynastic , usually being passed from a rebbe to one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is easily transferred to the offspring . On some occasions , in the absence of a suitable direct heir , a son-in-law or an especially eminent disciple is chosen . The modern Jewish writer and philosopher Martin Buber devoted a great deal of his life 's work to collecting tales concerning the various Hasidic rebbes . His two-volume Tales of the Hasidim , a monument of scholarship . mirrors both the charm and the profundity of Hasidic thinking . Though Hasidism has unquestionably evolved since the time of the Baal Shem Toy . becoming more formalized in its rituals ? some critics would even say rigidified ? I found its original message of joyful communion with God still ringing loud and clear in the streets of Brooklyn . I recall one night being swept up in the ecstatic revels of a group of rabbinical students . For hours , to the sour strains of an improvised trumpet-and-accordion band , they snake-danced in a great writhing , singing , chanting mass that seemed to become more and more energized as the minutes throbbed along . Joining in , somewhat reluctantly at first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hasid in front of me and allowed myself to be swept along on that mounting black wave of communal ecstasy . At one point I found myself swaying beside Moishe Green , whose forehead was pearled @# @#  | with sweat . His eyes glowed . " You see , " he breathed , " we are n't just dancing . We 're soaring to God ! " Even in a milieu where the spiritual predominates , the rent must be paid and groceries bought . The Baal Shem Tov himself often worked at humble jobs , and his followers in Williamsburg frequently do likewise . THE HASIDIC MODE OF LIFE , with its wide range of behavioral and educational restrictions , makes holding many kinds of well-paying jobs extremely difficult . You often see bearded Hasidim with dancing earlocks and sweating brows driving pickup trucks , heaving crates , working as clerks or storekeepers . Many work in Manhattan as diamond cutters and merchants ? bringing much-needed cash into the financially pinched Williamsburg community . Hasidic women as well as men work in the " needle trades , " manufacturing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are part of the capitalist society , " Rabbi Albert Friedman , a community leader , said . " We take jobs that do not interfere with our way of life . Yes , we have some wealthy men whom God has blessed with financial success , and they share ? are expected to share ? with the others . " A great many Hasidim work in jobs that fill the exacting and specialized needs of the community . Meat , for instance , must not be simply kosher but glat kosher , that is , kosher beyond any conceivable question . The Hasidim frankly distrust any food that they themselves have not subjected to the most rigorous conformance with Jewish dietary law . Hence , most of the food consumed by the Hasidim is prepared with fastidious care within the community itself . Ritual slaughterers dispatch cattle and chickens according to ancient laws . Stores feature " Jewish milk " from dairies supervised by observant Jews . Wheat for the Passover matzo , or unleavened bread , is guarded with unceasing vigilance from the time it is harvested and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bakery ovens in Williamsburg . If so much as a single drop of water comes in contact with the flour before it is used ? hence allowing it to leaven however slightly ? the entire batch is rendered useless for Hasidic consumption . This extraordinary care in food preparation has great appeal for other Jews , and some nonJews as well . Outsiders ' purchases of Hasidic  | foodstuffs help buoy the community 's economy . You 'll find no doctors or lawyers among the Satmar Hasidim , since they do n't acquire the education needed for the professions . Besides , going to college is frowned upon ? a waste of time in a life devoted to the study of the Torah and its vast exposition , the Talmud . AT THE AGE OF 3 , a boy has his first haircut , leaving him with shaven crown and untouched earlocks . Next he is taken to the bes medresh . There a dab of honey is placed on an aleph ? first letter of the Hebrew alphabet ? in the Torah ; his finger is placed on this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the study of God 's law is sweet . Thus begins a lifetime " toiling in the Torah . " Teenage boys often arrive at their school , or yeshivah , to begin study at five in the morning and , what with a day of study and prayers , do n't arrive home until eight in the evening . A few hours in the afternoon are spent on what the Hasidim call " English " ? meaning not just the English language , which many children first learn in school , but all the curriculum required to meet minimal New York State educational requirements , subjects such as math , history , and geography . " The plain fact is , " I was told , " many parents would rather their children did n't learn any more English ' than necessary . " Said another Hasid : " Constant study of the Torah and Talmud sharpens the mind to a phenomenal degree . Some of our boys have become computer programmers ? a profession requiring keen logical skills . " You see them studying , usually in pairs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desks or tables . Rarely do they use a pencil while studying , instead storing in their minds endless passages of Jewish law and tradition . Some go on to be ordained as rabbis , but , in actual fact , relatively few of Satmar 's scholars are needed for rabbinical posts . Most marry in their late teens or early 20 's , study for a final year or so full time ? if the family can afford it ? then find a job . For the rest of their lives they will spend much of their free time on Torah study . " Think what they might do if all that study were directed to some worldly purpose , " I remarked to a non-Satmar Hasid knowledgeable about the outside world . " I suppose so , " he said . " After all , look at Freud , Marx , Einstein ? all Jews who made @#  | their mark on the non-Jewish world . To me however , they would have been much bet off studying in a yeshivah . What a waste three fine Talmudic minds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by American standards , than boys . Not encouraged to study the Talmud . they need learn only the traditional practices required of a Hasidic housewife in running a completely orthodox home . Hence , they have vastly more time for worldly studies , and in speech , manner , and appearance often seem more Americanized than the men . The pivot of their lives is the home , which in Williamsburg usually means modest quarters in an elderly apartment building , abrownstone , or a housing project . Even in the dimmest basement apartment , there shines an inner sunlight , a glow of Yiddishkeit . To this sanctuary of feminine order and arrangement , the men and older boys often come rushing home from work or study for a hastily gulped meal with the family , then fly out again into the night for evening prayers at the bes medresh . On the Sabbath , of course , all this hubbub comes to a serene standstill , and the woman 's role as queen of the household comes to the fore . As wife and mother she lights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves no doubt as to her vital position in the family . Often , when not tied down to little ones , she takes a job to supplement the family income . On the occasions when women attend the bes medresh , the balcony is set aside for them . A latticed screen separates them from the menfolk , who are not supposed to be distracted from their prayers by the presence of the opposite sex . If their lot seems a far cry from women 's liberation , I found few complaints . " Nothing is more satisfying than a Jewish life lived in the Hasidic way , " one housewife told me . WITH NATHAN BENN one afternoon I knocked at the door of the basement apartment of a Hasidic friend , a rabbi - and thoughtlessly extended my hand in greeting to his wife . " Oh , no , " she said , stepping back . " I ca n't shake hands , I 'm sorry . Please take no offense . " I had forgotten that Hasidic women do not touch men other than their husbands and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is exceedingly rare to see an overt display of affection .  | Later we sat down with the family to a wondrous meal of chicken soup and gefilte fish , boiled chicken and whitefish , potato kugel , and so on ? an archetypal Jewish feast . The rabbi intoned a sequence of blessings in a marvelously moving cantorial tenor . As we ate , we imbibed deep draughts of Talmudical lore along with frequent glassfuls of fruitflavored Mayim Chaim ? a brand of kosher soda pop whose name means " water of life " or " living water . " At one point in the meal , Nathan poured himself a glass of Mayim Chaim . Seeing my glass nearly empty to his right , he swiveled the bottle around and started to fill it . The entire family gasped . " That is not done , Nathan ! " admonished the rabbi . " It is simply not done ! " " But what did I do ? " Nathan asked . " Oh ... well ... after all , Nathan , how could you know ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nathan pleaded . " Please , " said the rabbi , " we talk no more about it . The subject is finished . " , ographic , August 1975 Brooklyn 's Hasidic Jews 295  | With that , he lapsed into Yiddish , refusing to discuss the matter further . Later , recalling the incident to another Hasid , I demonstrated how Nathan had poured my glass of Mayim Chaim . " Stop ! " he cried . " Do n't do that ! " " Do what ? " I asked . " The way you 're pouring the bottle , turning your hand backward like that . . . it 's how one performs the ablutions when washing the dead ! We never make such movements in normal situations . " Once again I had run headlong into the multifarious rituals that at times seem to surround the Hasidic way of life like a spearpoint fence , making entrance difficult for outsiders , and egress no easy thing for the Hasidim themselves . Yet , in the eyes of the Hasidim , each spearpoint in that fence safeguards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adherence to every last punctilio of religious law is no mere rote act but a conscious fulfillment of God 's command , bringing about the sanctification of even the smallest acts of everyday life . WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLD , the Satmar Hasidim seemed to me to live not , so much side by side as back to back . I recall one afternoon approaching on the street a Roman Catholic nun whose church , with a largely Spanish-speaking congregation , stands almost incongruously in the middle of Williamsburg 's Hasidic neighborhood . When I asked her about her experiences with the Hasidim , she simply shook her head . " I have lived in this parish for 13 years , " she said , " but never has a Hasid come up and spoken to me . Not once . They do n't even catch your eye . " Police detective Nino Marano , whose beat has been Williamsburg for years , told me : " The Hasidim rarely bother other people , and would just as soon other people did n't bother them . We 've had periodic trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you rarely see a Hasid who starts the trouble ? though they often seem to attract it just by being so different and standoffish . Once a Hasid made insulting remarks when I ticketed his truck for a parking violation . Another Hasid reported the man 's conduct to the bes din , the religious court , where the Hasidim prefer to handle their own civil infractions . Hearing the case , the rabbis berated the man and he apologized . I was much more satisfied than if he 'd been hauled before a civil judge . " Nearly all Hasidim take pride in becoming American citizens , which allows them to vote . " We are often the swing vote in local elections and political affairs , " Rabbi Friedman told me . Although the Satmar Hasidim share to some degree in community funds made available by various government agencies ? they pay taxes , after all , like everyone else ? they @#  | prefer self-help to reliance on outsiders . They not only run their own school system out of Satmar funds , but also operate a walk-in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambulance service , a private community bus service , a summer camp system , an employment agency , and a free-loan society . They very definitely care for their own . Recently they have also established a small self-contained community for a few hundred Hasidim at Monroe in New York 's Orange County ? about an hour 's drive upstate . Does this signal a mass exodus from the inner city ? Probably not , at least for the near future . Immediate plans for the Monroe complex envisage a community of perhaps 250 families . " We are not running away , " Rabbi Friedman explained . " We are simply growing . " While I toured a Satmar school for girls . the principal , Rabbi Naftali Hertz Frankel. pointed out how reverently the children repeat the Pledge of Allegiance . " Almost all of them are the grandchildren of concentration camp survivors , " he said . " They know how much America and its freedom means . To them , the Pledge of Allegiance is almost a kind of prayer . " TAKING LEAVE of Williamsburg , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hasidic friend at the tiny Xerox shop he manages on Lee Avenue . Between running off copies for customers , he spoke of his first family ? all killed in the concentration camps ? and of the blessings of raising a second family in " a nice Yiddish place like Williamsburg . " The green light of the Xerox duplicator flickered on his gray beard and earlocks . I recalled an old Jewish tale I had heard about Hanoch the shoemaker , as one of the 36 legendary " secret tzaddikim , " or holy men , who ? unbeknownst even to themselves ? help sustain the universe with their piety . Hanoch , goes the legend , uttered praises of the Lord with each stroke of his tack hammer . Watching my Hasidic friend reel off another batch of Xerox copies , I conjured up the image of him , too , as one of the secret 36 , uttering praises to God each time he pushes the " print " button on the Xerox machine for another copy . It was one last indelible image to carry with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world in Manhattan .
