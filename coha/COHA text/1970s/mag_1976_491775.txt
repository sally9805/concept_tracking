OF TIME AND TWO RIVERS erne , breath , memory ! Contrary to common belief , the river begins with these , things more elemental than rain , which is only their outward sign , as immersion is to baptism . These days I am a river rat , a deckhand on the towboats , a catechumen in the rain of the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers . An occupation that never fails to elicit the same reaction from sod walkers , land-bound people . " Oh really , " they say with whitewash showing ' round each iris . " What do you do out there ? " I try to tell them . " Well , we wire up the tow , make locks , pick up barges , throw lashings . " " You what ? " End of conversation , beginning of monologue . First , towboat is a misnomer ; the vessel does not pull , it pushes . Barges , held in a formation called a tow , by heavy steel wire rope , are the object of the boat 's shoving . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are even further gone . Propeller blades and levers have won out . The company that keeps me hauls mostly steel and coal : bituminous coal from Kentucky up to Pittsburgh ; from the mills there comes finished steel bound for New Orleans and ports between . The return run finds ore in the barge coffers . Treasures of mines , furnace and foundry . It takes roughly twenty-eight days to make the crescent city/Pittsburgh run up and back . The standard crew is eleven : four deckhands , a watchman , cook , mate , chief engineer , oiler , pilot and captain . Every six hours the watches change . From twelve to six is the after watch , manned by the mate , two deckhands and pilot . From six to twelve is the forward watch , presided over by the watchman ( who relieves the mate ) , the remaining deckhands , the captain ( who relieves the pilot ) and the oiler , who cons the engine room . The chief engineer is on twenty-four-hour emergency call ; normally he wakes and rests as he wills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplies and keep the galley in order is entirely up to the cook . So much for base lines . The color , the texture , we and the river fill in together , alone . Except for our ghosts . Inevitably , the man in the white suit , cigar in hand and age-lined voice , strides with each syllable . Much as we owe him , Master Clemens 's river is not our river . In his day the sound of vessels was a steam whistle , a calliope cry : full , rich , mellow . Gabriel would have been hard pressed to better it . Now , on-board compressors vent their anxious blast out of horns . Their sound is a wail , strident and piercing , a warning not a greeting . The archangel 's revenge . I ca n't identify with Samuel . The boats under his hand knew ladies in perfumed dresses , kisses by moonlight and diamond-studded gamblers . We know only coal dust and rust . I feel more akin to Mike Fink , river roarer , who lived when keelboats were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back were a man 's best assets , a healthy pair of arms his livelihood . Blue collar primacy and conceit . Forget for a moment that diesels , noble monsters that they are , rule the waterways . Remember only one thing industry has given the floating world  --  steel for wood . A metal of many moods , depending on how it 's alloyed and who or what presses upon it . As men walk the decks it is hard , enduring , unyielding . By the end of a watch knees creak , and thighs , calves and haunches are stiff as cheap Manila hemp . Sleep is not so much a cherished solace . Rivermen are largely walking wounded in the land of nod , insomniacs . After perhaps a week on board I 'm down to four hours of genuine sleep a day . It 's not the pounding engine whine . It is that the Mississippi and Ohio are cousins of the Styx and Lethe , Greek rivers of the underworld  --  fountainheads of oaths and forgetfulness respectively . One binds shores and seasons to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The other , the Ohio , could drive a man mad in her meandering green water . Once more , steel in strands , bundled one aboard the old steamers , then seventeen . When the diesels took over the number fell to its present level . At every contract we hear the paring knife being whetted ; even the senior men worry . We have heard of companies running two on deck per watch , even fewer on tanker tows whose units require less care . Life on the long runs is one extreme or another , either bone-rendering work or numbing boredom mitigated only by basic maintenance . Hours develop the weight of days , days become interminable , weeks unimaginable . Not surprisingly , the turnover rate is horrendous . So many hear the money is good ( an illusion ) and think the river is all cruise . They do n't conceive of her as an escape to a greater reality than they have ever known . Where men can become toys , broken , set adrift . I had never thought of a man as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow named Horace was making his maiden run . He stood the forward watch , I the after . We shared the same room so each of us could muster a little privacy in the interim . Horace was gaunt , with a blemished countenance , high-boned hollow cheeks , sparse beard and beak nose . His lank frame and awkward gestures gave him the manner of a grounded condor ; those great wings so erudite in wind , worse than useless upon turf , magnificently ugly . Never did I see him pick up a skin mag , not even Playboy . In his collection of softbacks were volumes of Nietzsche , poetry anthologies , even Edith Hamilton 's Mythology . The last was disconcerting , since I also traveled with Ms. Hamilton 's gods . Faintly , I thought him my twin , or else fate 's idea of my caricature . Since he was on the opposite watch I did n't see much of him . Meanwhile , everyone save me picked up an inkling that Horace was beginning to go astray . His nervous energies were growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the line , barely . Not quite ten days into the trip , coming out of McAlpine Lock , he lost control . His mind frayed , fiber by fiber . He s bent over at his post , starboardside stern , after casting off , totally immobile , panting like a locomotive . The captain gave a short blast to call the other men off the tow ; they did n't respond . At length , the cook talked him in . When she brought him up to the pilothouse he was incoherent , spittle at the corners of his mouth . The windows fogged over from his hyperventilating . Farley , the mate , implacable in everything , got someone to gather up his clothes  --  Horace would n't enter our room till I vacated . His only violent act was a right cross that tore a hole in the galley door screen . We never restrained him ; where he wandered so did the mate . Not one of us thought to conceal the chef 's knife that was so keenly prominent on the galley table . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trembling at the gray blade , thinking . Some of that rigor was for the potential of its edge , mostly it was for the thought , " It could have been I. " Horace will never deck again . Maureen , our cook , was most affected . When she spoke of dear old Horace 1 could smell fear and pity . Most strange , to hear her soothing that way . Maureen is a brash , maniacal culinary enchantress . ( Ah , the pounds I 've gained at her whims . ) She will do absolutely anything on a dare without flinching . Her red hair and ruddy complexion are awesome visions when temper storms . Once , in passing during the commotion , I gave her a questioning look . She stared back , her arms wrapped around her , " What are you looking at ? " more in defense than defiance . it was as if I were the only one to ever catch her being tender , though she had grown children at home . Melodrama . I saw her not long ago . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maureen examined my put-on icy glare . Satisfied , she let out a laugh to dispel all credulity . Women . That same week the crew was short a second man due to illness . I wound out that stretch by putting in ten hours of 69 overtime , ninety-four hours in seven days . Not long after , I dreamed about a lovely , demure , treacherous young lady . Her name is Karen , though her surname has changed of late . Her hair is the color of very olde bourbon , just as heavy , fully as intoxicating . As I fell into sleep that morning I made a near fatal mistake  --  I forgot where I was . The movie in my head took over entirely , a tyranny of undisciplined images . Late in the darkness there appeared a .357 magnum revolver , a Colt Python  --  the muzzle turned toward me , dead center for my forehead , very close , no more than a foot away . Suddenly , the focus shifted to the background . Karen was holding the weapon , poised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowing . She fired six times , not a miss . As each shell passed through my skull I watched . That part of me that bore my name had escaped , leaving my body behind . There was no pain , no blood , only a vague gnawing . Back in steel reality the door flashed open , a voice rang , " Watch time ! " Never had I felt so ... weak . I let my body become an automaton , without feeling , trusting momentum and refleX . In the evening I stood on a stem corner , Horace 's corner , coffee cup and lit cigar in either hand . I was wearing a coat of melancholy and memory ; self-conscious drivel ! Amid my thick pretense I recalled my first homecoming , seeing the other men met by their women , ladies in waiting . Not bothering with formalities , gracious good-byes , I snagged a ride home , grabbed the phone and called Karen . Needless to say she was agonizingly aloof . She knew nothing of storms , snapped wires , sore bones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see me again . Simple . Concise . There 's still a dent in the refrigerator ; my right hand was raw for a week . A wail  --  vicious , tangible  --  struck my back , then again . We were passing a vessel , starboard to starboard . The pilot had given two short blasts of the horn , maneuver etiquette . Half out of breath again , trying to recover , I heard laughter . centious , unsympathetic . Turning , I saw the wake of the passing boat lapping against our starboard flank . I marked the phenomenon down to too much smoke and caffeine . " Sobriety can be disorienting , " I murmured . But I knew better . It was the cost and cure for dire pomposity . The river sheds no tears , ever . There 's more to memory , the most murderous force and subtle allure the river owns . Not reveries of tragedy , because they inspire ardor , but of exceedingly tedious things . Bits and pieces of land-bound life recur in instants before sleep . Did I pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drain the pipes ? Shut off the heat ? Take out the garbage ? Did I tell the paperboy to stop delivery ? Whom can I have check on things for me ? That question indicates the power of distance . Married men feel this acutely in diverse ways . Leaving a wife heavy with child , missing Christmases , things to be done at home . In short , waiting to find whether young children will fear him , or adolescents will lose heart . As for wives , absence may make them fonder but certainly more weary . Miles either buckle or exalt the will . Both , really . Most people spend a third of their productive lives at work . We spend one-half to two-thirds of it , depending on the company . That works out to six to nine months a year . Granted , the time off is our own , solid chunks measured in days , but we pay dearly . Still , most of us can not fit into the regimen of an eight-hour day . We can not be commuters , human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , others because they have to be . And then there are the runners . A fine increment of intent lies between desire and need . The former begins with hunger , freedom from assembly lines , a want to see the riparian world . The latter is virtual inertia . Somewhere along the line the " have to 's " fell upon river work merely to survive ; their attitude alters little . Runners are a different animal . They come in two varieties depending on their direction . Some work here only to accumulate land time , then return to the river with grave distaste . They 're like inmates on furlough for whom decking is internment , punishment , and land is Eden . Lastly , there are those who despise distractions , interpersonal gamesmanship , lackluster romance . There are those who run to the river and find life here like geometry , bare bones essence . No politics , thin philosophy , entertainment , debate for debate 's sake . Life is reduced to movement , whatever is necessary to transport cargos from landing to landing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in three dimensions , hard , substantive , no intrinsic meanings . After all , what could be more real , more crudely refined , than a 5,000-horsepower towboat ? Given all that antilyrical , manmade metal theory , no wisp of mystery should remain . Nagging , potentially fecund exceptions refuse to succumb . Take " sally-manders " for instance . One night in late fall , while I stood the p.m. six , Moe Grossman , the watchman , explained them to me . We were walking out to the head of the tow . There was a lock about a half mile upstream . Inexorably , the bow pushed even with the arrival point marker . Moe commenced talking the captain toward the long guide wall over the intercom . He called out distance and position : " Ahbout six hunnert feet ta clear da end ah da wall ... twenty feet to da good side ( meaning we would miss by that measure ) . . . ahbout four hunnert feeet ta clear ... tw000 hunnert . ah111 clear da end-o-da-walll .... She 's comin ' in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet ... six .. . three ... one ... gettin ' readeee ta tutch ... corner 's on da wall cap'n . .. " As the barge rode the wall it drew a fresh scar in the concrete , releasing sparks , and plumes of calciferous smoke  --  the scent of burnt bones . The captain started to swing the stern in so the portside would be flat against the guide wall . Thus aligned , the tow could continue without collision . Moe kept up his litany , calling out the markers as we passed them 600 feet ... 400 feet . . . 200 feet ... a countdown to the chamber itself . Since it was a new-generation lock , one built in the last fifteen years , it would enclose and raise the entire tow . No need to work piecemeal , like at Gallipolis . . . but that 's another story . " Ahlll clear ah  --  da -- gatereecess , " Moe declared , " up in-sighd . " At last . The engines idled back , blind impetus carried us deep within . Night chill settled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wo n't be too long now . Be gettin ' out da sally-manders ! " Moe chimed , his breath steamy white . My head cocked , " Sally-man-ders ? " I queried . " Ya . Dem fuel oil burners we keeep up unner da pilothouse . " He smiled , knowing that he had one on the college kid . " Be bringin ' dem outta storage soon . Be bringin ' dem down here ta keep us warm commin ' inta dees locks , " he said , even more delighted with himself . We came alongside a floating pin set in its own slot in the wall . I slapped on the heavy poly ( polyester ) lock line , bringing the barges to bay as the lower gates , now far behind , began to close . As they pinched upon their mitered seal , somewhere within the lock walls butterfly valves opened . Gradually , the water level rose . I kept an eye on the line , taking up slack as need came . My mind was on sally-manders , Le. , salamanders . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the courtly . In winter she is a witch , entrancing but a sorceress nonetheless . Guys who allow lines to touch the water while casting off are called " summertime deckhands . " Dense cold turns lines that have only kissed water inflexible , nearly useless , often even dangerous . Case in point . December . Coming into Emsworth Lock , gateway to Pittsburgh , I was out on the bow alone . My line was run up to a pin atop the wall . I was to check our forward progress , act as brakeman , to prevent damage to the upriver gates . Emsworth is notorious for the decayed seals of its gates , water spouts into the chamber constantly . Things got nasty quickly . The poly line was stiff from dew and // spray . Tension and ice caused the line to bind , in effect welding it to the timberheads . The line began to reach overstrain . Finally , it broke loose , permitting the tow to slide under the fountain . A six-inch flood rushed over the gunwales , knocking lines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barges barely touched the gates , and the minicataract never got the chance to freeze . Mention Cincinnati to a master ( captain ) or pilot , watch him wince , ever so slightly . Count the gray hairs on his head , that 's the cardinal of summer Sundays he 's run through Cincy Harbor . Daedalus would be proud to have designed the labyrinth of bridge piers there . Coming down river the current is a consistent urge . The pilot must steer through the navigable slot that structure affords . Concrete supports stand guard ominously , unimpressed , along safe channel spans . Summer Sundays pay out time in idleness , the pleasure boaters swarm . Blood pressure rises , as navigation difficulty compounds . Sunny day sailors 1 have no love for . As they jet by , kicking up rooster tails , they gawk at us from behind Italian sunglasses ; chrome , fiberglass and fatuous style . To them , as their expressions tell , we are caged animals , curious , foreboding , taunted . They do n't think . Few have any knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turns to bald antagonism , wind , torrents , lightning in the night , they are gone to the ports . Meanwhile , we act at the company 's bidding . If a barge is to be dropped , we do it , no matter what part of hell we 're in . Hyperbole ? Try it sometime . Still , most of my disdain stems from their ignorance of towboat physics.They do n't hesitate to cross a few hundred feet ahead of our course . The realization that a tow may take a half mile to stop , maybe more , never occurs to them . Should their engine stall in transit , the bow rakes would plow them nine feet under . Moreover , they do n't consider steering changes are planned well in advance , from memory , leaving the pilot to a torment of maintaining balance . Cincinnati gives us essential benefactors too  --  her pasteboard sons and daughters . The U.S. Playing Card Company , located there , does n't suspect the role their products serve aboard after performing their original purpose well , bent not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outlines the plays , the shifting , with cards . Set out , afloat on the table veneer we all know , those face down we keep , those face up are given away , discarded at landings . It is an equation , a use of symbols , paper for steel , one deck for another . Too , you could call it choreography . We swing barges on lines , tangents off the timberheads , in a kind of matrix ballet . Farfetched ? Perhaps . But think of a barge , oblong , afloat , capable of holding 1,000 tons plus , being parried on a Manila line no thicker than my wrist . Working that line is a matter of check , give and hold . A matter of skill certainly . But is it art ? Maybe . Last . One more story , one I left hanging . Gallipolis Lock is the most infamous on the Ohio . High water makes it bloody precarious to enter , and equally arch to stop barges on exit . You see , this asylum lock is too small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a full tow . The tow must be broken in two , a first and second cut . Nine barges are in the first cut , six more plus the boat equal the second . Since the first cut has no vessel to propel it after locking , it must be pulled from the chamber by a winch . Getting moving is no problem ; sheer torque manages . Stopping is different . A man rides the stem , waiting to be even with a pin ( post ) in a wall niche . Just past the gates he slips the line on and wraps it round the timberheads . Carefully , he rends off the line , slow , slower , tilt the barges cease . Doing it too hard could snap the line , leading to possible injury or death . Too light a touch may use all the line , leaving the stern rider alone down river muttering to himself . Coming out of Gallipolis downstream that first time riding thestern , 1 turned bloodless . I waited , like a boxer , for that first familiar body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came . My line on and wrapped up , I bore down , too hard . One of the three strands broke outright , while another cracked . The last remained intact . Quaking , still feeling the final disjointing yank in my grip , I saw the mass halt with a slam . As I dogged the line off , the tremors remained . Yet , all the fear and anxiety I ever knew caught fire . There was n't anything 1 would n't have dared , no man I would n't fight was as intense as a ghetto tough . These days , I know trite truth by rote ; discretion is the better part of valor . Alliteration is still a mixed virtue . I contemplate Horace , Maureen , Grossman .. . . Karen , and I am not so fired by abandon . Do n't ever let them tell you , " Experience is the best teacher . " Utter bunk . Correct them . Remind . " Experience keeps a dear school , but fools will learn in no other . " Being articulate is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
