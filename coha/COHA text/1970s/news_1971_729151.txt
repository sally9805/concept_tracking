txt The snow turned to sleet and the sleet to ice as Derek Curtis Bok , who calls himself a " typical California boy , " looked out over the Harvard Law School yard and talked of the problems facing higher education in the United States . Now that the Californian has come east and has risen to be president-elect of Har- vard , the nation 's oldest university , he must help grapple with the questions of how to keep American private universities open to students of all economic backgrounds at a time of spiraling costs  - -  and increase their responsiveness to students . " Perhaps , " he said in an interview in his Law School office ( he is currently dean ) , " shortening the period of education to , say , three years would prove reasonable . This would reduce cost by one-fourth // *Bok seeks to win students at Harvard // " Another idea would be to lower the repayment programs so a student could spread the cost of his education over a good part of his working life . The cost of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A look backward " Where would the funds come from ? " he asked . Maybe from insurance companies , banks , or the federal government . They could be paid back either as a percentage of income or a debt obligation . " Shifting in his black leather chair . Dean Bok looked back as he looked forward " When I was an undergraduate at Stanford , we were quite isolated , completely unaware of what was happening in the world , " he said . " The focus was on passing exams , football games , social activities . " Today the student is much more involved . Also there is an extreme change in how much less the student will take for granted . There is an unwillingness to recognize anyone or anything as having inherent authority unless good reason is shown . " Dean Bok , formerly a law student and professor at Harvard , said he hopes to show the students those " good reasons " for accepting him as president . He plans many informal meetings with students over dinner or in the houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , open hearings of committees , and a lawschool newspaper by which students could keep informed of general Law School developments . " Harvard has all the virtues of decentralization , " he went on . " I do n't yet know the best way to respond to needs in each school , but I 'll encourage this kind of communication throughout the university . " ROTC protested One of the main issues facing universities in general and Harvard in particular is the campus role in the community , and in the nation as a whole . At Harvard , the university was shut down by students two years ago when police were called m to haul students out of University Hall . The students were protesting the Reserve Officers Training Corps on campus as well as other military involvement of the university . Last spring a strike was again called over the U.S. incursion in Cambodia . At commencement last year , part of the Cambridge community came in to disrupt and protest Harvard 's expansion into their neighborhood . How active ? How active a role should the university @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community ? Mr. Bok answers cautiously , but he indicates that the university should 1 have an active if low-keyed role . Scholarship cited " I do n't like people referring to the university as a social-action agency , " he said . " That connotes the university 's butting into other people 's problems and telling them how to solve them . One of the university 's chief responsibilities is to scholarship . " But the university does have a role ; in more concrete terms , the university can do something first within its own community . In the Law School students are very involved in offering free legal services . Through legal aid and legal defense , the students are handling over 1,000 cases a year . "
