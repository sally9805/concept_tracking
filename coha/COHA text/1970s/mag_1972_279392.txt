" This is one of Shostakovich 's most profound works . It is filled with optimism , affirmation of life , and trust in man 's inexhaustible strength . " So said Tikhon Khrennikov , head of the Soviet Composers Union , last January after the Moscow premiere of Dmitry Shostakovich 's Symphony No. 15 . <P> The new work by the 66-year-old Soviet composer was played in Manhattan last week by Eugene Ormandy and the Philadelphia Orchestra . It is in deed affirmative , at least by contrast with Shostakovich 's bleak 14th Sym phony ( 1969 ) , a meditation on death . <P> But the 15th is also grandiose and tire some , a big , empty balloon of a symphony . Shostakovich makes all the right orchestral gestures . Snare drums tap away energetically . Muted trumpets wail balefully from some nostalgic never-never land . The first cello sings a sad song . At the proper climactic moments , the strings and brass saw away at each other like legions at war . Yet gesture is just about all there is to it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collage in which a new work is created partly by grafting together chunks of other composers ' music . The first movement had barely begun last week when , to the chuckles of the audience , out trumpeted the clarion call from Rossini 's William Tell Overture ( the Lone Ranger 's theme in bygone days ) . In the lugubrious second movement came some wintry wood wind chords right out of Debussy 's Jeux . <P> The fourth and final movement seemed dedicated to Wagner - first the somber three-note motif from the Ring cycle , then a bare but undisguised hint of love theme from Tristan und Isolde . <P> What could the former bad boy of Russian music be up to now ? Fanciful theories abounded in the after-concert chatter . Rossini 's William Tell is based on one of Schiller 's strongest freedom plays . Was Shostakovich , by quoting from the opera , signaling his support of Alexander Solzhenitsyn and other persecuted Soviet dissidents ? By incorporating touches of Wagner , was Shostakovich perhaps giving artistic voice to the new spirit of friendship between the Russian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the new symphony , already recorded by Ormandy for RCA , might almost become as popular for guessing games as Elgar 's Enigma Variations .
