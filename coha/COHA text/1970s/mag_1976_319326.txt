Slightly more than a. year ago , I was in Washington to present a special leather-bound copy of our first Bicentennial issue , Independence ! , to President Ford . It was warmly received and read in the White House , and in about 6 million other households-more than any issue of TIME ever published . It seemed appropriate , then , that as soon as TIME 'S second Bicentennial issue , The New Nation , was completed , a special edition be given to the country 's second highest ranking reader , Vice President Nelson Rockefeller . As it turned out , the Vice President had just finished serving as a bicentenary tour guide , having escorted French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing through the Revolutionary War battle site at Yorktown . Mr. Rockefeller did not say whether President Giscard seemed unusually well informed about that era , but Paris Correspondent Gregory Wierzynski reports that Giscard packed a copy of The New Nation in his briefcase before departing for the U.S. He said he would use it as a " document de base . " <P> <P> Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their own lives-registered sharply with the correspondents who reported this week 's cover story . Joseph Kane , a former field artillery lieutenant whose beat is the Pentagon , observed how important it was to be " of the military but not in the military , to appreciate the quest for the ideal the officers.seek while at the same time assessing an illness growing from rigidity . " Said Washington Correspondent Arthur White of his visit to the Naval Academy : " There was all the brass again , spit and polished in blinding white uniforms , yes-sirring and no-sirring and stirring old memories . " Added W.W. II Army Sergeant White : " They get more than their share of raps in our antimartial society , and I thought of Kipling 's lines : ' For it 's Tommy this , an ' Tommy that , an ' " Chuck him out , the brute ! " / But it 's " Saviour of ' is country " when the guns begin to shoot . ' " <P> New York Correspondents John Tompkins and Roland Flamini spent the week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ask questions . " I had forgotten how carefully scrubbed and polite cadets are , " said Tompkins , an Army staff sergeant in the South Pacific in W.W. II . Concluded Flamini : " Some may find it hard to accept West Point 's honor code as anything more than elitist mumbo jumbo - but there is something to the place . " That " something " and the scandal 's scope are the story : edited by Ronald Kriss , an ex-Army specialist third class ; written by James Atwater , ex-Korean War lieutenant ; and researched by Anne Hopkins , granddaughter of Admiral William S. Sims ( Annapolis ' 80 ) , and Eileen Chiu , daughter of an Air Force colonel .
