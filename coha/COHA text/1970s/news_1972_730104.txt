txt Pennsylvania issued today a consumers ' guide to life insurance  --  the first of its kind ? showing that the costs of some basic policies were almost three times those of others providing the same coverage . The 21-page booklet gives statistics on 166 companies doing 95 per cent of the life insurance business in the country . Included are data for buyers in three age groups showing how much they pay in premiums for the same basic protection , the average yearly cost to each group of a typical $10,000 straight life policy , and the ranking of the company in relation to its competitors . The numbers show that companies charging the lowest premiums do not necessarily offer the best values because of differing methods of payment of dividends and computation e interest on the premium . In addition , some of the major life insurers such as Metropolitan , John Hancock , Equitable , Prudential , Travelers and Aetna , do not score as well in the comparative ratings as many , of their smaller competitors . " I 'm sure Metropolitan wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State Insurance Commissioner who ordered the study made , told a news conference in the state Capitol , Much of the original data stemmed from a book titled " Cost . Facts on Life Insurance : Interest-Adjusted Method , " published at $25 a copy by The National Underwriter Company of Cincinnati . Dr. Denenberg emphasized that the comparisons had been made only on the basis of cost . He noted that subjective factors that might be considered include the reputation of the company and its agent , the company 's financial condition , and the original purpose for taking out the policy . " This is the first readily available guide for the consumer , " Ile said , adding that the cost figures and rates would apply nationwide with very little difference . The data and the ratings in the buyers ' guide , which may be obtained free from the State Insurance Department , involve a series of assumptions . For example , the guide arbitrarily divides buyers into the three age groups that customarily buy many of the first policies , The first category assumes a 20-year-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man or a 38-yearold woman , the last a 50-yearold male and a 53-year-old female . Premium rates for both sexes are the same in the three categories . Another assumption is that all the policies are alike ; that is , that each is a $10,000 , straight life , cash-value insurance policy on which payments continue until death , which accounted for $35-billion in sales last year . Not included in the shoppers ' guide are policies sold to groups of people , National Service Life Insurance commonly held by veterans , and term life insurance , on which premiums may end before death . The final major assumption involves the method of computing the true annual cost to the buyer of a specific policy . While many methods may be employed , the one used in the guide is known to the trade as the interest-adjusted method , which factors in case value , accumulated premiums , accumulated dividends as well as an interest rate of 4 per cent yearly . Cash value in this case equals the amount that might be borrowed on the policy after 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the $10,000 policy to the person paying the premiums on it . As an extreme example , data in the guide show that over the first 20 years of such a policy , if it were taken out when a man was 20 or a wontman 23 , the average yearly cost on a policy of the Connecticut Mutual Life Insurance Company of Hartford would be $22.40 yearly . In contrast , according to the guide , if the policy were purchased from the Georgia International Life Insurance Company of Atlanta its cost would be $61 yearly , or almost three times as much . To cite another example from the guide involving the same age groups , the average yearly cost if purchased from the Home Life Insurance Company of New York would be $23.10 , while it would cost over twice as much , $53.10 , if bought from the Travelers Insurance Company of Hartford . Using another example from a different age bracket , that for a man of 35 or a woman of 38 , the guide said the policy sold by the State Life Insurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first 20 years it was in force . The same policy 's cost would be less than half as much . $42 , if purchased from Bankers Life Company of Des Moines . " We are certain that the high-cost companies will no like our " Shopper 's Guide to Life Insurance , " Dr. Denen berg told the news conference . He issued one caveat : Don ' drop a policy if it is already in effect . His point was that switch ing policies from one company to another , despite the corn pany 's ranking or the cost of its typical policy , is expensive since much of the cost for the first several years is paid to the insurance agent as his commission . The State Insurance Department has already issued a shopper 's guide to auto insurance , and a shopper 's guide to hospitals in the Philadelphia area . Both this guides have drawn sharp criticism from the groups involved . The next projects are guides to term ininsurance and health insurance . Comments in Industry Gilbert W. Fitzhugh , board chairman of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , said here last night that the company , which has 48 million customers , did not want to be lowest in price . " The only way you can be lowest , " he said , " is to sell very selective ly . " At the Equitable Life Assurance Society , the nation 's thirdlargest life insurer , Coy G. Eklund , executive vice president , said , " the exact cost of life insurance , unfortunately , is not ascertainable until the date of death , in any company . When you take into consideration all the values in a policy , including the value of service , the Equitable stands high . "
