Creation of the mammoth Dallas-Fort Worth Airport , gushed a publicity handout , was " like a combination of The Impossible Dream and Mission : Impossible . " That was last October , just before the world 's largest airport ( 27 sq . mi. ) opened for business . From that point on , the complaints have drowned out the publicity , suggesting that Dallas-Fort Worth might be better named Airport : - Impossible . <P> Located halfway between cities that are Texas ' traditional rivals - and an arduous $14 cab ride from either- the $700 million airport has been successful only in enraging most of the travelers who use it . They complain bitterly about the outrageous prices and protest that they are " quartered " to death - charged 25 for coffee , local phone calls and even for going from one airline to another . To add indignity to outrage , the quarters often have to be obtained from change machines that return only 95 on the dollar . The only free facilities are drinking fountains , and the water pressure is often so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touted technological innovations to move people and handle baggage have turned out to be disastrously ineffective . <P> The biggest problem is the airport 's vaunted Airtrans , a 13-mile computer-controlled system of tracked trams designed to transport passengers around the terminal perimeter . Because the system was apparently oversensitized , the cars grind to a dismaying halt if even a light bulb fails . The trains often skip stations or fail to open doors after stopping , while passengers inside bang on the windows to get out and those waiting to board bang on the glass to get in . Houston Industrialist Howard Purvis says that he was recently trapped aboard Airtrans " for two complete circuits . Finally , I got off close enough to my flight gate to race to it . Barely made it . " <P> The design of the American Airlines terminal , the airport 's busiest , was completed before new security regulations went into effect , making it impossible to screen passengers for various flights at one checkpoint . As a result , each loading gate has become a security gate , creating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , again because of overcomputerization . Passengers have complained that the system chews up their bags as voraciously as if they were hamburgers , though the operation has been improved . As a result of the snafus at Dallas-Fort Worth , the distance from downtown , and the exorbitant runway fees , Braniff and Texas International have moved part of their operations back to the old Love Field , only five miles from Dallas . Delta also is considering pulling some of its flights out of the giant airport . Southwest Airlines , which never moved from Love ( despite lawsuits filed by the city of Dallas in an attempt to force the line to fly from Dallas-Fort Worth ) , has recorded nearly a 100% increase in passengers and profits .
