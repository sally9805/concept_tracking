Can quiet diplomacy end the furor in the Senate ? <P> Three times last week , the long black Cadillac limousine glided into the underground garage beneath the State Department ; three times Soviet Ambassador Anatoli Dobrynin slipped into a private elevator and rode up to the seventh-floor office of Secretary of State Cyrus Vance . After each meeting , both diplomats avoided reporters ' questions . There had already been far too much threatening and ill-considered rhetoric about the problem that confronted them : the controversial role of Soviet combat troops in Cuba . <P> Just a week earlier , Vance had publicly declared that the newly reported existence of a Soviet brigade in Cuba was " a very serious matter , " and that he would " not be satisfied with maintenance of the status quo . " After several days of silence , the Soviets produced an unyielding answer . Pravda , the Soviet Communist Party 's official newspaper , declared that the Russian forces in Cuba were there solely for training purposes , had been training the Cuban army for 17 years , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period . Furthermore , said Pravda , the Soviet troops had " an inalienable right " to be where they were . Added Pravda : " All contentions about the arrival in Cuba of ' organized Soviet combat units ' are totally groundless . " The paper blamed the whole crisis on elements within the U.S. Government that were trying both to undermine Cuba and prevent Senate ratification of SALT II . <P> Though Vance would disclose no details of his talks with Dobrynin , it was apparent that the Secretary of State was trying to be conciliatory . Even while the Senate continued to reverberate with demands for a Soviet withdrawal , State Department officials began suggesting that some face-saving accommodation could be found . Perhaps the Soviets could disperse their brigade , or simply pledge that it had no offensive purpose . <P> What was most perplexing about the whole affair was the number of questions that remained unanswered . Was there really a buildup of Soviet forces in Cuba ? If so , since when , and by how much ? What exactly was the Soviet brigade doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did it have a combat role ? Did its presence represent a Soviet gesture to support Castro 's maintenance of 40,000 Cuban soldiers in Africa ? Was it guarding Soviet information-gathering installations that eavesdropped on the U.S. ? And if U.S. intelligence did not know the answers to any or all of these questions , why could it not find out ?
