 | Hard-Top Tent Camper Rides Dual-Use Trailer A hardtop folding trailer is to the d-fashioned camping tent what a ern sports car is to a Model T. e convenience of easy setup , combined with the greater comfort of flatp head room and sleeping high off e ground , have made this type of camper one of the most popular on e road . Many readers have requested plans r building one , but POPULAR SCIENCE felt such a project should have special feature not available in the many fine commercial models that range in price from a basic $300 leeper to fully equipped luxury rigs costing nearly $3,000 . I , too , wanted to build my own camper for family vacations , but I hesitated to invest in a vehicle that I 'd be able to use only once or twice . : year and which would take up ear-round parking space ? especially since I 'd need another trailer for hauling jobs . My solution : Build a detachable camping unit that could be mounted en an existing trailer chassis . If you already own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my design to fit i ' . If you 're starting from scratch , you can buy a trailer chassis ( I chose one from Sears ' catalog , but many ethers will do the job ) and adapt it to . additional uses . The camper body detaches from the chassis in half an hour ? the time it takes to jack it up , unplug wiring and remove a handful of bolts . Since the camper is basically a flat-bottom box . you could insulate the floor and mount it on skis for a wintertime camper , or even put it aboard a motorized raft and have a waterborne shelter . How it works . Erected for use , the foam-plastic top ( reinforced with glass cloth and resin ) is supported on four hinged conduit corner posts . Part of the raising load is counterbalanced by a pair of heavy screendoor springs at each hinge joint . Should these springs weaken in time , they can be replaced for about a halfdollar each . The tent portion of the camper is permanently fastened around the inside of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when the camper is folded . The inner portions of both bed frames are a fixed part of the body . The outer portions hinge out to make a portable bedroom ( for four ) about 12 ' wide . The tent is stretched over the bed frames , and held to the body and frames with snaps and elastic shock cord . Center head room inside is about 6 ' - 21/2 " . Folded , the camper is sealed weathertight for travel or storage with weather-stripping around the door and under the edge of the hardtop . Materials are standard . All the various round shapes used to build the camper are standard sizes of steel pipe , thinwall electrical conduit , Reynolds " do-it-yourself " aluminum tubing , and wood closet pole . Aside from a bit of white pine for stiffeners. all wood is exterior plywood . Body @#  | material is % " exterior Masonite . K-90 primed house , siding . One 4-bysheet is required . You may choose ? with a sturdy sew:rig machine and a good seamstress ? : o tackle the canvas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans ( ordering instructions below , left ) . Or you may want to have the tent portion made up by a local tent and awning or upholstery shop , as we did . One morning we turned the completed camper over to a small shop that makes a lot of custom boat cove rs , pickup covers , tents and the like . We had it back all completed the same evening . The price was quite reasonable , considering the 20-plus yards of heavy 12-ounce duck they used for the job . They were willing to oblige with any degree of fanciness : n the way of zippers , colors , window size , and so on . The foam-plastic top . The only thing very special in the way of materials is the urethane foam used for the top . We 've made arrangements with a plastic-foam supplier to offer t - thick four-pound ( per cu . ft. ) rigid urethane foam plastic in sheets sized for easy handling . A sturdy glass cloth is already applied to both sides with a temporary " glue " ? just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're working with it and applying resin . This is a tremendous help in easing assembly , ( For address , see end of article . ) We chose the new Sears No. 6157 trailer because it is low-priced , readily available by mail ( shipped knocked down , it weighs about 200 pounds ) , and because it was just about the right length ( 82 " ) to support fulllength beds , and wide enough ( 631/2 " ) to give a roomy center aisle ( 39 " wide ) . Catalog price : $140 . The body overhangs the frame 1 " at both ends and 3 " on each side ; this gives good support to the body and still allows it to be removed from the frame . Modified Sears foldaway trailer jacks attach permanently to the body and temporarily to the frame to support it when jacked up for leveling ( they provide 5 " of adjustment ) . If you do not intend to remove the body you may want to buy foot-operated camper jacks from a local camper Continued on page 134 @# @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the frame . A trailer chassis of the size chosen . is ideal for the alternate installation of a plywood deck with a light steel angle around the edge for transporting two bikes , a snowmobile , or . : garden tractor . Sideboards added to , a plywood deck make a good utility hauling trailer . One drawback of this Sears trailer is that it does not have fixed-hub wheels for its 4.80-by-4.00-8 four-pl tires . This means you have to remove the wheel bearings to change a tire . You may want to build your own chassis from locally available components . A good mail-order source for axles , springs , and wheel assemblies for home-builts will be found in the parts-suppliers list ( end of article ) . You can make the camper almost any length ( the foam top sheets are 7 ' 4 " long ) , any width , but keep these facts in mind : Body length must be at least 41/2 " longer than the bed frames to allow for folding , and the bed frames should be at least as long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little greater than the 70 ' called for in the plans ( if you want a wider aisle ) ; but if you made the body narrower , the folded-in bed frames will overlap . This is of no great consequence except that it will cut down storage space between the frames and the top . As dimensioned. the folded bed frames just clear each other at the center . Choose a chassis of at least 1,000-pound rated capacity ( our trailer with Sears chassis , loaded with essential camping gear , weighs about 750-800 pounds ) , capable of being safely towed at highway speeds . To give adequate support to the camper body , a narrow chassis such as a boat trailer with wheels outboard of the frame could be modified by adding bolt-on steel-angle outriggers to the frame rails . in- Reinforce foam where support-tube beares ings and latches attach . Cut away 2 " ng squares , glue in 1/2 " - plywood inserts to in. keep foam from compressing under force . of Combination screen-flap windows may be od made any desired size . Inside view shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ce. partial opening without losing privacy . Latches are snapped for travel ? two to a side ? to prevent top from coming loose . They can be locked with cotter pins . Note plated window lift to aid in raising top .  | For maximum stability a trailer should have about 10 to 15 percent of its total gross weight in the form of a tongue load . On a unit of this size , you would n't want to exceed 125 pounds . Knowing the camper body will weigh a pretty evenly distributed 500-550 pounds , you can plan on where to position it on a chassis . How to go about building . Recognizing that dimensions and procedures may change with the size and materials you choose , here is how to go at the project . Saw the 3/4 " exterior plywood for the floor . Widthwise it takes a full sheet plus about half another . Ends , and the remainder of the second sheet are used for rear panels , door , gussets , wheel wells , etc . Join floor pieces with a spline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cut out openings for wheel wells , allowing an inch clearance all around for oscillation . Well depth ( 2 " in our ease ) is calculated on the basis of the height that the tire could come through the floor if the spring should bottom . Drill 7/16 " holes around the top flanges of the frame for bolting on the body . We used 18 bolts , locating one hole as near each corner as possible and evenly spacing them around . Lay the chassis upside down on the floor and mark frame hole locations . At the same time , drill and cut four pieces 1/8 " - by- 1/8 " - by- 1 " steel angle to fit across the floor to add rigidity and support the floor when the body is undecked . Drill holes for Teenuts . Counterbore these holes from the top side so Teenut flanges can be driven flush with the floor . Coat the floor bottom and the inside of the wheel wells with asphaltic coating , cut for easy brushing with naphtha if you wish . The 4-by-8 sheets of 3/4 " exterior plywood make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Glue and screw the preassembled sides and ends to the floor . Use waterproof resorcinol glue for all gluing on the camper . Before adding the inner " benches " that form the fixed part of the bedframes , drill the floor corners for the telescoping jack housing conduit . Fit the door , leaving a gap at the piano hinge for the he " weatherstripping to be applied later . Regular boat-glassing polyester resin , mixed with a catalyst so it will harden , is used to " glass " the top . Three sheets of urethane make the top . The fourth sheet is cut it strips ( using a utility knife ) for sides and ends . Make the top alp . 1/8 " larger in each direction than body . Strip back the glass cloth . : insert 1/2 " plywood plugs where ( - ner-post bolts and latches will Glue ( with resin ) 3/8 " plywood strip to inside surfaces of side and ( pieces . When set up , cover with cloth tape . Cut the three top sheets to length and glue a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sub-assembled side and e pieces right on top of the body . Apt resin at joints . Nail plywood to pi , wood at corners with finishing nails . Use masking tape to hold plastic together while curing . Cut scrap plywood the same shape as the endpieces to give temporary support to top sheets , as shown in photo . Bevel edges of top sheets to well at center joints . Apply resin all joining surfaces and tape in place When cured , apply resin to the r. : strips that hide the joints in t sheets , tape them in place , and turn the top upside down on a flat surface . Nail through the foam near the edge t. into the rail strip , using large-@#  | headed plasterboard nails to pull the fairly limber foam into full smooth contact with the rail strips . Bevel all foam edges topside with the knife and round them smooth with coarse sandpaper . Leave the bottom corners of the top square about 11/2 " up for application of molding . Apply resin and glass tape over the rails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pints inside and out ( 2 " wide ) . Glass in corner-reinforcing plates . Fill any objectionable voids with epoxy putty . Give the entire top a full coat of resin to bond the cloth to the foam . Sand out any rough spots and feather the tape edges . Apply another com pl ete coat of resin and sand completesmooth . Paint the entire top with two coats of automotive enamel , sand ing between coats . Priming is not re wired . Drill support-rod bolt holes , install molding , latch plates , lifting handles , and reflectors . Apply pressure-sensi tive weatherstrip around the edge un der the molding . Set the body on the chassis . Bolt it down . Install the hinging bedflaps . Drill the frame for the studs that hold the lower end of the bed-flap support @# tubes . Epoxy and screw on the hinges that hold the top end of the tubes . Trim tubes so flaps are level when folded out . Make up and install corner jacks . Paint the body inside and out . Attach aluminum molding around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , keep in mind that wiring should be run along the frame , with connectors installed near the rear light locations , if your trailer is to be undecked . Carpeting or other floor covering may be installed now . Set the top on the body . Fasten latches to compress weatherstrip all around . Make up and fully assemble the four hinging corner-support tube units , including the bolts that fasten them to the camper . Drill pin and bolt holes the same size as the fasteners to make the assemblies as tight as possible . Using one unit as a fixture , insert bottom bolt in body hole , position tube exactly vertical , then determine and mark location of support brackets at all four corners . Apply clear lacquer or exterior polyurethane to all exposed metal parts that may corrode or rust . Fold hinging supports and insert bolts into top and body holes . Locate and install support brackets under folded tubes . The top can now be raised , supports pinned , and locknuts installed to bolts inside . Check out the lights , tire pressures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are tight . Once your license plate is attached , take the trailer for a shakedown spin . Safety and law . If you buy a new chassis , it will be called an " incomplete vehicle . " To comply with federal laws , it must have two red tail lights , two red reflectors , two brake lights , two turn signals , and a clear license-plate lamp . A trailer should also have Class-A amber reflectors at all four front corners , red reflectors at rear corners . If your trailer is over 80 " wide , the law calls for clearance lights . A good trailer hitch ? with at least a 17A " ball ? is needed on the car . Be sure to install safety chains as well . Check your state laws regarding trailer licensing . You may have to reach an understanding on dual use of the chassis where laws require special licensing of a camping trailer . Your project may well be called either " home-built " or " reconstructed . " @#  | @# The entire camper must be checked regularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season , for wear and tear All bolts must be tight . Frame and axle must be checked for damage and cracks . Wheel bearings must be inspected and lubricated . The entire top-support mechanism and brackets must be checked for damage , cracks . and wear , and repairs made as necessary . Check and make any necessary tent repairs . Carefully examine the hitch , safety chains , and trailer lighting . Undeck the body . Procedure may vary with your particular construction , but basically you unpin and lower the corner jacks . Remove all the bolts that attach the body to the frame . It may be necessary to remove two of the frame jack brackets , a well . Jack the body evenly about 1 off the frame ? to clear the angles under the floor , and simply pull the chassis out from under . Reverse the procedure to remount the body . If wheels are much higher than the frame top , some provision must be made to jack the body higher to clear . We suggest you remove the wheels . The body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jack and floor construction are not suited for extended support without the frame . Do n't , under any circumstances , get under the body while it is supported only on jacks . Where to buy the materials .

An uminating beam , either light it elec ? - ins , passes through a sample and is unified . The sample must be very  - -  . in so the light can get through . ery rarely , the light microscope is . - ed to view an opaque object ; but ? ? E technique is difficult and often un.eductive . The transmission picture can tell lot . Most advances in medicine and . her fields have been made by study:t , such views . But a conventional microscopic image is basically an X- , v view . A transmission picture of a for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cell than an X-ray i Raquel Welch resembles a 3-D color photograph of the same lady . The SEM ? a different principle . The new scanning electron microscope sees surfaces ? just as your eyes do ? not Xray views . And whereas conventional microscopes have extremely limited depths of field ? they 're in focus for only an extremely thin zone , with anything outside that zone blurry ? the scanning instrument has a depth of five millimeters or more . So its pictures do n't look like sections or slices of life ; they look like realistic photographs taken with a good camera and a sharp lens . The SEM 's totally different kind of picture grows out of its operating principle . The action takes place in long vertical tube at one side . At the top , a glowing filament cathode generates a stream of electrons , much like the one in your TV picture tube cr a conventional electron microscope . ( ' oils focus the electrons into an ext-emely fine beam ? usually several hundred angstroms in diameter . At the bottom of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coils in the tube sweep the beam back and forth across the fly 500 to 1,000 times in a TV-like pattern . As each electron in the beam hits a particular part of the fly , it smashes into the surface atoms and knocks loose a shower of other electrons . Some of these so-called " secondary " electrons fly out into the column . Nearby is an element with a positive potential which attracts the negatively charged electrons . But this stream of secondary electrons produced by the scanning beam is not steady : Its intensity reflects perfectly the changing surface contours of the fly . This changing current is used to modulate the brightness of a luminous spot flying back and forth across the face of the oscilloscope in synchronism with the scan-
