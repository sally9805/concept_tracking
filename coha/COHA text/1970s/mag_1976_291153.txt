Too many inner-city schools are as much ghettos of education as their surroundings are ghettos of life . Their teachers go through the motions of teaching . Their pupils seem more interested in vandalism than vocabulary . The parents regard the schools as alien , unfriendly territory . It need not be so . Two inner-city schools in Illinois and Connecticut are proving that it is possible to be not only effective centers of learning but also centers of community activity and hope . Though their methods differ in some ways , one factor is common to both and available to all : getting the parents more involved . <P> Grant Elementary , squatting amid glass-strewn streets , decaying houses and a massive public housing project on Chicago 's tough West Side , used to resemble a way station to nowhere . Two years ago , sixth-graders were reading at an average of two full years below their grade level . Says Chicago 's District 9 school superintendent Albert Briggs : " They were programmed to fail when they got to high school . " <P> Briggs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no students in his district would be admitted to high school unless they could read at the sixth-grade level . To help Grant students achieve that proficiency , he created Operation Higher Achievement . Basically , it is a program of determined cooperation among teachers , pupils and parents . Last fall nearly all parents of Grant 's 1,350 students-75% of whom come from single-parent households-signed " contracts " pledging , among other things , to encourage their children to read to them and " to provide ... a quiet , well-lighted area for regular study . " For their part , teachers undertook to work closely with parents . Together they staged reading festivals , pep rallies and open houses . Grant officials say that roughly a third of the parents became " intensively involved " and that in one year their 400 children recorded average reading-score gains of 1.1 years-a month above the U.S. average . Moreover , discipline improved ; absenteeism and vandalism decreased . <P> Superior Quality . Martin Luther King School , a handsome building on a grassy lot , has always looked like an inner-city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education was abysmal . Staff turnover and student absentee rates were high , and fights were commonplace in the halls . Today , thanks to a research program of self-help supported by the Ford Foundation , the Yale Child Study Center and the National Institute of Mental Health , the quality is not only good but superior . All pupils who have been in the school for two years are up to grade level , there has not been a major behavioral problem for three years , and attendance is the best of any inner-city school in New Haven . <P> At the King school , parents of almost all the 325 students attend monthly curriculum conferences , report-card meetings and potluck suppers with the school staff . Some 25 parents assist teachers in the school for 10 hours a week at $2.56 an hour . The program involves other expenditures for a Yale social worker and four special consultants . In all , it costs $35,000 a year . Says Dr. James Comer , the Yale psychiatrist who launched the program : " If the money is n't spent at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far greater amounts to cope with delinquency and crime .
