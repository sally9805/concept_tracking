When a town dies , there is rarely a eulogy , a farewell or even a tear . Thus it was something of a commendable service when the U.S. Bureau of the Census took note last week of the passing of five tiny incorporated towns in the decade between counts . Lost River , Idaho , the bureau reported , had lost all 58 of its residents ; Lakeside , Colo. , declined from 28 to none ; Westfall , Ore. , from eight to none ; Ridotto , Iowa , from six to none , and the lone resident of Ironton , Colo. , either died or moved away . But towns , the bureau discovered , do not die easily . The inhabitants of Lost River complained loudly that any reports of the death of their town were greatly exaggerated . There are still 40 folks , mostly ranchers , living in the same Antelope Valley site , and they figure that the census bureau ought to be able to find them . Lakeside similarly claimed that it still has 17 residents , properly proud of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
