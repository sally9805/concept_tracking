From time to time , United Nations delegates have complained about New York 's crime rate and high cost of living and suggested that the world organization move elsewhere . Last week the Security Council met in Addis Ababa , the capital of Ethiopia , which is a bracing and breathtaking 8,500 ft. above sea level . The experimental session was convened on a tight budget of $106,000 in answer to a request by the U.N . ' s 41 African members that the council look into the continent 's problems on the spot . <P> Breaking a longstanding tradition that only U.N . members can address the Security Council , the delegates heard from nine African guerrilla movements variously trying to liberate South Africa , Southwest Africa , Rhodesia , Angola , Mozambique and Portuguese Guinea . Given the setting , the delegates were clearly under pressure to produce resolutions favorable to the liberation movements-at the expense of the Western powers . One resolution demanded that Britain scrap its proposed agreement with the government of Rhodesia ( TIME , Dec. 6 ) and call a constitutional conference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Britain 's ambassador Sir Colin Crowe replied quietly that " my government can not accept a directive to change its policy while it is being worked out " and cast the sole veto of the session . <P> The Security Council adopted a more or less moderate version of the expectable anti-apartheid resolution . A phrase , suggested by African delegates , that called upon all states " to deny military cooperation to the South African government " was dropped at the request of Britain , which would otherwise have been forced to break its agreement to help South Africa patrol the region 's sea lanes . Even so , France abstained , since the resolution also called for strict observance of a U.N . arms embargo to South Africa , which Paris has chosen to ignore . Half a dozen countries-the U.S. among them-abstained for similar reasons on a resolution that called on all nations to deny arms to Portugal to " continue its repression of the people of the territories under its administration . " Washington recently signed an agreement with Lisbon promising it nearly $500 million worth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> " The last thing that Africa expects from us , " said the Sudan 's Foreign Minister Mansour Khalid during the session , " is an innocuous resolution that couches the incredible in the unintelligible . " The Council did not do that badly , but it did not accomplish very much either . The fact remains that the delegates have passed a total of 128 resolutions on African problems during meetings in New York over the past 26 years . Convening the Security Council in Addis Ababa may have made Africans more aware of the problem of working out an acceptable compromise , but did not make the resolutions any more effective .
