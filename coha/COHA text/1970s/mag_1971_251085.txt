AS petty and personal as it may seem , the clash between President Nixon and Labor Chieftain George Meany is for the highest political stakes . At issue is not only the fate of Nixon 's plan for the nation 's economic recovery , which may depend on whether labor accepts the Government 's wage guidelines . Also in the balance is the 1972 presidential election . Determined that Nixon must go , Meany is preparing the biggest labor participation of any campaign in history . Just as determined to stay , Nixon plans to beat back the attack by showing that he serves the national interest while labor serves only itself. * <P> The battle opened head-on at the A.F.L.-C.I.O. convention in Bal Harbour , Fla . A week after the encounter , pundits were still busy retracing the maneuverings of these two seasoned infighters . The President staged the first surprise . Though he had been routinely invited to attend two months before , he did not accept until the eve of the convention two weeks ago . George Shultz called Meany to ask if Nixon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replied the labor boss . The executive council had scheduled a meeting to vote on a resolution of noncooperation with the Pay Board . Nixon would have to come later . <P> No Flourishes . A swarm of presidential advancemen descended . They made a number of requests of Meany : an offstage microphone for announcing the President 's arrival , a union band to strike up Ruffles and Flourishes and Hail to the Chief , a seat of honor to the right of the podium for the President to occupy while Meany made the introduction , removal of delegate seats in front of the speakers ' stand to make room for live television cameras , banishment from the press area of reporters covering the convention so that there would be space for White House correspondents . <P> Meany flatly turned down all the requests . The White House persisted about the music . The Secret Service brought along sheet music and placed it on the musicians ' stands . Meany told the Musicians ' Union not to let the orchestra play . Hissed a Nixon man : " You will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ musicians lay down their instruments . <P> When the President emerged , he was accompanied by no music , and received only perfunctory applause from the delegates . Since he could not get the seat he felt the dignity of his office required , he walked directly to the podium . As the President spoke off the cuff , Meany sat glowering near by , occasionally muttering a sardonic rejoinder . When he finished , Nixon stepped down from the stand to shake hands with delegates . Within moments , Meany gaveled the convention back to order and sent the President on his way . The delegates gave the labor boss a standing ovation.
