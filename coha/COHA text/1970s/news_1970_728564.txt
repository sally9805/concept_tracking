txt That much-publicized " ban " on DDT is exceedingly slow acting . Nearly six months have passed since the Cabinet secretaries of three federal departments agreed to begin eliminating most uses of the destructive pesticide . Yet , according to persons who monitor the industry , the manufacture and sale of DDT in the United States remains as brisk as ever . Four conservation groups , acting through the Environmental Defense Fund , now are suing the Depirtment of Agriculture ( one of the three partners in the DDT agreement ) to try to stiffen its pesticide regulations . The urgency about controlling DDT arises because , even after its use begins to decline , the amount in the nation 's waters will swell for several years . Why ? Runoff of DDT already in the soil , plus DDT 's long-lasting chemical life . ( 1 ) Still a burden The foot soldier 's backpack seems here to stay . U.S. Army scientists have been studying how best to distribute weight carried " by infantrymen in the field . But their finding is that there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulders . It had been thought the load might be spread out by increasing either head or foot gear . But the shoulder pack still proved the least tiring . Indeed , scientists found that carrying weight on the feet uses up six times as much energy as carrying it on the torso . Optimum weight for an infantryman to carry , the Army says , is 40 pounds distributed in the shoulder packs , around the waist , and in the hands . A rifle and ammunition take up about 17 of those pounds . Researchers have long worked to lighten the soldier 's load . And important strides have been made both in redesign and in use of light modern materials in web gear and harnesses as well as in objects carried . But for every weight lightened here , a pound is added elsewhere . So despite these efforts , the GI 's pack remains a burden . EA Toll tangle Federal regulation and technological advances often make it cheaper to telephone long distance than within a state . So Congress is looking into telephone rate . setting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interstate calls while state regulatory bodies set toll charges for calls within state boundaries . A bill now under consideration ? with strong support from state utilities commissioners ? would set up a joint federal-state board . It would have authority to prescribe uniform procedures for determining the division between interstate and intrastate service costs . In addition to giving state officials more power , the bill is thought likely to result in lower costs for local calls . The move is timely since Bell System companies , which own and operate 84 percent of the nation 's 108 million telephones , now are seeking rate increases in 13 states totaling some $600 million . Stretching the $ The Department of Health , Education , and Welfare is launching a brief course in wise consumerism for its employees . It hopes such instruction will become a trend setter for other federal agencies and for private industry . The " course " consists of four 45-minute classes over the next four weeks which will offer counsel on everything from food purchasing and apartment renting to wise use of credit and tips on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ granted training time to attend the sessions . HEW officials feel it is their responsibility to help employees get the best value for their paycheck dollars . e Honoring Eisenhower Washington may soon be selling coins for profit . A proposal to issue 150 million Eisenhower silver dollars has passed the Senate but is currently bottled up in the House . The coins , not intended for general circulation , would be 40 percent silver and 60 percent copper . Priced between $3 and $10 apiece , they would net the government some $470 million in sales . Crux of the controversy has been over issue of the commemorative coin in silver at a time when the coinage trend is away from this prestige metal . By way of compromise , the Senate bill also proposes minting 200 million Eisenhower coins in copper and nickel ( like today 's dimes and quarters ) for regular circulation . If the House nods approval , the first coins would be struck Oct. 14 , 1970-80th anniversary of the late President Eisenhower 's birth .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
