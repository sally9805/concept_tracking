SUMMER WISHES , WINTER DREAMS <P> Directed by GILBERT GATES <P> Screenplay by STEWART STERN <P> The title has the sound of fake poetry , but the movie beneath it has the solid ring of truth . The good wishes of summer may be summarized as a desire to feel , and express more intensely , love in its several varieties . The bad dreams of winter are the products of life 's thoughtless intrusions on Rita Waiden ( Joanne Woodward ) . <P> Rita 's ophthalmologist husband ( Martin Balsam ) is stolid and bumbling , and she can rarely bear even his lightest touches . A son has drifted into homosexuality , a daughter tolerates Rita impatiently . Rita 's relationship with her mother ( etched in dry point with just the slightest drop of acid by Sylvia Sidney ) has become a series of long , grumbly quarrels . Rita , in short , can not connect properly or rewardingly with anyone she cares about . <P> It is a banal problem perhaps . But it is also the stuff out of which millions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mid-life crisis . For Rita it crests and breaks when her mother dies suddenly . Unmelodramatically but touchingly , Rita starts to come apart . This is not a subject that crops up much in movies aimed at today 's youth-dominated market . Indeed , the central virtue of Summer Wishes may be that it is willing to dramatize such a human issue . But its carefully observed and delicately felt manner of doing so is also worthy of note . <P> When Stewart Stern wrote Rachel , Rachel for Miss Woodward , he displayed a gift for biting dialogue and for transforming ordinary situations into sequences that carry a sharp sting of recognition . The same ability is repeated here , notably at a family funeral where the mourners try to hide their dislike of one another . Gilbert Gates directed I Never Sang for My Father , an underrated film that was also about family tensions . He shows himself once again to be an unpretentious director with a talent for worming himself to the emotional core of characters and scenes . <P> As for Miss Woodward , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the screen today . In Summer Wishes she is brittle , cold , hysterical , but above all a woman who knows that she is lost and is in desperate search of herself . It is a lovely performance , almost matched by Balsam . Cannily holding back until he revisits Bastogne , where he fought in World War II-and where he was last fully alive-he shows us the center of a character deeper , more mysterious than we had imagined . <P> The film concludes satisfyingly but not resoundingly , its people merely having lived a little more and learned a little more-mostly about the need to accept themselves and those who are close to them . If she had her life to live over , Rita says at one point , " I 'd still miss all the things I missed and I 'd still do all the things I hated . " Maybe so . But at the end one feels that , given a second chance , she might manage with more grace and with less pain for others . Meanwhile , her example is worth pondering-and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
