txt About to buy a home in the suburbs ? Better check which way the wind usually blows . If your prospective home is downwind of the nearest big city you likely will get a third more rain ; twice as much hail ; more pollution ; more cloudy days ; and more odors than city dwellers or upwind suburban families . And if you live in the city and want to do something more about the weather than just talking about it , plant a bush ? or some grass , or a tree . Vegetation in a city cools hot summer months in contrast to the endless blocks of concrete and brick , which act like a " sponge , " soaking up heat in the day , releasing it slowly at night . These are some of the findings emerging from a nearly completed five-year study by agroup of U.S. scientists on how the presence of cities changes the weather . The study focuses on St. Louis , but participants say it applies to most of the world 's cities . The study , called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in part by the National Science Foundation ( NSF ) and the State of Illinois . Warm air rising from cities carries with it microscopic particles from coal-burning factories , auto exhaust , home-heating fuels , and other pollution sources . Raindrops form around the particles , making clouds that tend to release their moisture downwind of the city , the study found . Most of the effects of extra rain , hail , and pollution were noticed within about 25 miles downwind ( east ) of St. Louis , but on a few days pollution from the city was found throughout Illinois , Indiana , and even parts of Ohio ? as much as 350 miles away . Since the atmosphere in the United States moves most often from west to east , pollution generally increases from western cities eastward , says Currie Downie , NSF program manager for weather modification and a coordinator of the study . A " fair amount of cleansing " takes place , however , as air passes over the Rocky Mountains , he adds . This dumping effect shows " this world is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professor of meteorology at the University of Chicago and one of the study participants . For example , crop production within 25 miles east of St. Louis was slightly more than normal for the rest of the area due perhaps to extra rain , the study showed . But , cautions Dr. Braham , crop yields farther away may be less than usual because they get more " acid rain " ? rain with higher-than-normal degrees of sulphuric acid , which traces largely to city pollution . // *Before you buy a house in suburbs watch for those city downwinds // Some studies have shown that clouds formed over Chicago , St. Louis , or Detroit , for example , can dump rain three to four times more acidic than normal on places as far away as New England , says Mr. Downie . One study shows rain " fallout " from Britain and Germany has made some forest soils in Sweden so acidic " trees are not growing like they used to , " he adds . But extensive sampling within 30 miles of St. Louis showed no significant damage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Changnon , a geography professor who worked on the study for the Milos State Water Survey . " At this stage it 's not clear that urban-altered rainfall is all bad . " Meanwhile , he suggests , new suburbs might be located best upwind of cities and agricultural areas in the downwind areas that receive more rainfall . And because cities create more fog and clouds , new airports and highways would be built most logically " upwind " to get maximum visibility , says Richard Dirks of NSF . And more parks , even rooftop gardens , will make city weather more enjoyable in the summer , and may help convince some families not to move to the suburbs , says August Auer of the University of Wyoming , another study participant .
