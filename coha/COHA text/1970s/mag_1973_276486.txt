THE PRESIDENCY <P> ON the surface , Richard Nixon 's White House is a visual and mechanical marvel . Inside , where the President reigns in solitary splendor , the marvel is the man himself . The President 's post-election campaign of self-assertion rolls on unchecked . Last week there still was no explanation of just why he had unleashed the massive B-52 bombing attack on North Viet Nam . His fiat to reorganize the Government caught the men elevated to super positions unawares and stunned the strata of bureaucracy below . Congress looked on in ignorance like the rest of the country . All through the nation Nixon was gaining the reputation of some kind of grim fiscal reaper as the depth and extent of his budget slashes filtered out . The actions were often not as unsettling as the calculated silence and distance of the President , an unprecedented attitude in an office that , as Nixon himself has explained , depends on keeping the people informed . <P> There was drama of sorts , of course . Colonel Ralph Albertazzie soared over the Rockies on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Force One ( Boeing 707-VC-137 , over $10 million ) . The plane soon will stand ready with its 16 private phone lines to sweep Nixon off on new adventures , while maintaining a flawless electronic umbilical cord to the Oval Office . <P> On the ground , Ron Ziegler , the youthful Press Secretary with the Hollywood profile and sideburns as hardy as Zoysia , was about to be made czar of the whole presidential image , a reward for his four flawless years of stewardship over the White House policy of non-information . He appeared in the press room in a suit of daring plaid and good-humoredly avoided answering questions on peace and bombing . He also showed up on a Virginia indoor tennis court in an " Izod outfit , " the supreme quality in tennis attire . Coordinated Izods can cost $50 . His play was just as good . <P> Back at the White House , Nixon turned 60 , and the wizards in the White House theater , without even straining , came up with The Maltese Falcon , a 1941 thriller just made for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Sydney Greenstreet , and the good guys win . There was a new film too , this one put together by Paul Keyes , producer and writer for Laugh-In , and it showed ten minutes of football fumbles and flubs while Rowan and Martin played straight , as if they were the President phoning in strategy to the quarterback . They say Nixon broke up . <P> But behind the crisp smiles and beneath the beautiful precision there are moments , some say , when Nixon is troubled . A lot of people , including Congress , are angry . Something has gone awfully wrong in those parts of the presidency that ca n't be flown or worn or priced or charted . They are the invisible dimensions of the job : civility and consideration , understanding and willingness to listen , candor and the patience to explain .
