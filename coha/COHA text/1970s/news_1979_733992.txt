txt Onyema M. A. Okorie does not want them to finish the revolution without him , so he is going back to his roots . In a few days , the 39-year-old Nigerian will be leaving the modest house in the Williamsbridge section of the Bronx in which he lives with his wife and six children . They will return to Nigeria , where he will seek to represent his ancestral village in the civilian national government that is about to be formed . " There is an air of animation now , " he said , " because the military is going back to the barracks . It 's a regeneration , a renewal of life . Everybody wants to be a part of this peaceful revolution in our life style . " Mr. Okorie ( pronounced oh-KOR-ee ) left the village of Orlu in Nigeria 's oilrich eastern region 14 years ago to attend college in New York . He stayed , worked , became involved in the community , married a girl from home . During those years he developed a complex of skills as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feels Nigeria and tiny Orlu need more than New York does . So two weeks ago he resigned his Job of the last nine years as a power-systems engineer for the New York Telephone Company to begin a new enterprise . With a civilian government scheduled to assume power in Nigeria next October after 13 years of military rule , Mr. Okorie will run for the new Senate from the state of // Imo under the sponsorship of one of the country 's new political parties . Mr. Okorie is an Ibo , a member of the ethnic group that led the unsuccessful secessionist movement to form an independent state of Biafra . He is the son of Chief Okwaraojiaku Alfred , leader of more than 50,000 people . The decision to go back to Nigeria , he said , was a result of a moving personal experience : During a visit home a few months ago he was approached by a delegation of the district 's chiefs and elders led by his father , who made what he called an " emotional appeal " for his return . " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other day , interrupting preparations for his departure . " They felt I was staying here in the country that has more when I did n't need to : " he added , " and that I should come back and help build the economy . It was a very persuasive argument . " The move will mean not only a change of career but also the uprooting of a family of six small children and the leaving behind of several relatives in America and a network of professional and community ties he has built up over the years . Mr. Okorie , a Roman Catholic , enrolled in Manhattan College in 1965 after learn-4 ing about the Catholic college in the Bronx from Peace Corps volunteers he had met as a youth in Orlu . He earned a bachelor 's degree in electrical engineering there , and later a master 's degree in business administration for engineers at Baruch College and a law degree from LaSalle Extension University . A year after he started college the civil war broke out in Nigeria , cutting him off from his family and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full-time jobs to pay his way , he left something of a mark on the small college . He organized a soccer club , which later developed into a varsity team , and set up an International Students Association , an Interracial Justice Society and a tutorial service for teen-agers in Harlem and the South Bronx . " There were very few blacks at Manhattan when I started there , " he said , " and I did n't feel that could be justified , given their position in the city . " Thus began the volunteer tutorial service , run by students and faculty members ; after Mr. Okorie put in two years of work it began to show a payoff in minority-group youngsters gaining admittance to Manhattan College . He said that the test marks of one youngster whom he brought home to study with his own children went from 60 in mathematics to S5 in two years . At work he served in the Junior Chamber of Commerce , as coordinator for several charity drives in his division and in another series of volunteer tutoring projects . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and I realized that the engineering clerks could really have a chance at better jobs if their mathematics skills were improved . Ninety-five percent of them were women , and most of them did n't do math in high school . " Using his lunch hours , he organized and still teaches a calculus course for the clerks at the telephone company 's Broad  --  ay building . " Now they are all crying , " he said with a smile . " In the company , they are teasing me , ' You will have to take your harem hack to Africa . ' - And a string of luncheons was organized when the word of his departure got around . An 18-year-old nephew , whom Mr. Okorie brought to the United States 10 years ago as an adopted son , will stay behind as a freshman at the Stony Brook , L.I .. center of the State University . Another young relative has just started as a freshman at Manhattan College . A brother is a medical student in Grenada in the West Indies . " He will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to merge it with modern medicine , " Mr. Okorie said . A onetime president of the 1.500-mem. ber Ibo community in the New York area , Mr. Okorie said he believed that his return , particularly as an Itio , will I inspire others who want to leave but who have been postponing the decision ? in part out of lingering anxieties from the past ? to follow in his path . " With me going . " he said . " others will say : ' If even the Government wants him . it must be O.K. to go . ' "
