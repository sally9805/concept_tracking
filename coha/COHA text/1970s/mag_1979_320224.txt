Collecting great art has always been a rich man 's hobby , the province of the Medicis , the Morgans and the Mellons . For others , the only time the price is right , or at least affordable , is that fleeting moment between discovery and celebrity . The early part of the century , when a now famous Picasso etching could be had for $20 , was one such time . The late ' 50s , when a Rauschenberg painting cost less than $1,000 , was another . For photography that golden moment was , almost literally , just yesterday . <P> Consider the market history of the late Paul Strand 's work . Fifteen years ago , his platinum prints sold for $125 . In 1972 they were still a bargain at $1,500 . Today a good Strand can go up to $12,000 . <P> Similar stories of steep appreciation can be told about the work of almost every other major 20th century photographer : Alfred Stieglitz , Edward Steichen , Edward Weston , Walker Evans , W.

The great pictures of the 19th century are more expensive still . Last May two albums containing 100 early California and Oregon scenes by Carleton E. Watkins were sold for $198,000 . " A print is amusing at $100 , " quips one art dealer . " At $1,000 it 's art . " <P> Many people , of course , have known that from the minute Louis Jacques Mand Daguerre found a way to fix images on silver-coated plates in 1839 . " Photography was art from the moment the first shutter clicked , " insists Graham Nash , 37 , a San Francisco musician ( formerly of Crosby , Stills and Nash ) , who owns one of the largest private collections on the West Coast . But only in the past decade has the general public placed photography alongside the other major arts . The first commercially successful New York City gallery devoted solely to photographs was opened in 1969 by Lee Witkin , who is credited with helping start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years have collectors been willing to lay out the large sums they have traditionally devoted to paintings , drawings or lithographs . <P> " When I started selling photos in 1976 , I 'd first have to prove to my customers that photography was an art , " says San Francisco Dealer Stephen Wirtz . " Then I 'd have to convince them it was an art worth spending money on . Now they say , ' Oh , dear . This is obviously art . Why did n't I do something about it earlier ? ' " Five years ago there were perhaps a dozen galleries in the U.S. selling photography ; now there are at least 125.
