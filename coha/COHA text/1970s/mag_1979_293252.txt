Indochinese refugees fight suspicion and hostility <P> Shortly after 6 a.m. last Tuesday , World Airways Flight 031 touched down at California 's Travis Air Force Base . A stream of 396 Indochinese refugees began to struggle down the stairway with their makeshift shopping-bag luggage , pausing at the bottom to fold their hands and bow formally to the flight attendants . After a briefing in Khmer and Lao and the processing of health forms , the refugees were hustled aboard buses and taken to a TraveLodge motel for introductory lessons on American life : how to operate light switches , how to use a toilet . Many stood on the motel 's second-floor balcony and stared uncomprehendingly at the rush of traffic below . Others squatted on the pink sidewalk and simply gazed at their feet . They had journeyed several centuries in 19 hours , and the shock would be a long time wearing off . <P> It was a typical first day in America for the dispossessed Indochinese , who are now flowing into the country at the rate of 12,000 a month . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people and other refugees from the current upheaval , the highest total by far of any Western host country . New arrivals , who tend to cluster in California and the Gulf Coast region of Texas , are given free English lessons and job training , and access to Medicaid and welfare . Nine major voluntary agencies , including the U.S. Catholic Conference and the Protestant Church World Service , match arrivals with reliable sponsors who will help them adjust to their new life . The U.S. gives the voluntary agencies $350 per refugee . <P> Despite the aid , refugees are discovering that assimilation is far from automatic . There are the usual problems of language and loneliness . The months and often years spent in the crowded squalor of the resettlement camps have taken their toll : malnutrition is widespread , and cases of tuberculosis are found . <P> But far worse in the long run may be American resentment . Although a recent Gallup poll found that 57% of those questioned said that refugees would be welcome in their communities , a call-in poll sponsored by the San @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influx of boat people . <P> In a few cases , suspicion has already turned to hostility . In Denver , 18 refugee families fled from their dilapidated housing project two weeks ago after a brick-and-bottle battle between the Vietnamese and their chicane neighbors . Four families have since returned . Although the fight was sparked by a chicane theft , some of the chicanos mistakenly thought that their neighbors had fought against the U.S. in Viet Nam . <P> The worst incident so far occurred last month in Seadrift , Texas ( pop . 1,000 ) , where some 120 Vietnamese had settled to work in crab processing plants . The Vietnamese rapidly saved up enough money to buy their own fishing boats . American fishermen accused them of undercutting market prices and of violating longstanding " gentlemen 's agreements , " like keeping crab traps a suitable distance from those of competitors . <P> On Aug. 3 , Billy Joe Aplin , 35 , a local fisherman , was shot and killed in an argument on a pier ; two Vietnamese brothers were indicted . That night three of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire bombed . Most of them fled . Although many Vietnamese have trickled back , the tension persists .
