around , sat down facing the table . " You 're lookingwell tonight , Fluel , " he observed . The Duke of Fluel , lean and dapper in silver jacket and tight-fitting silver trousers , gave him a wintry smile , said nothing . " Now , then , friend , " Velladon inquired confidentially , " just what was your business with Movaine ? " " Well , it will come to around twenty percent of the take , " Quillan informed him . " We wo n't argue about a half-million CR more or less . But around twenty per . " The faces turned thoughtful . After some seconds , the Commodore asked , " Who 's we ? " " A number of citizens , " Quillan said , " who have been rather unhappy since discovering that you , too , are interested in Lady Pendrake and her pals .

" " Is he leveling ? " " He 'd be nuts to be here if he was n't . And he is n't nuts . . . at least , not that way . " " There might be a question about that , " Fluel observed . He looked at the Commodore . " Why not ask him for a couple of the names that are in it with him ? " " Hagready and Boltan , " Quillan said . Velladon chewed the other mustache tip . " I know Hagready . If he " I know both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crews out of Orado . Quillan operates there occasionally . " " Pappy Boltan 's an old business associate , " Quillan agreed . " Reliable sort of guy . Does n't mind taking a few chances , either . " Velladon 's protruding blue eyes measured him a moment . " We can check on those two , you know . " " Check away , " Quillan said . Velladon nodded . " We will . " He was silent a second or two , then glanced over at Cooms . " There 've been no leaks on our side . And they must have known about this for weeks ! Of all the inept , bungling " Ah , do n't be too hard on the Brotherhood , Commodore , " Quillan said . " Leaks happen . You ought to know .

Twenty per . No time for haggling . . . we can raise Yaco 's price to cover it . " He stood up , and Ryter stood up with him . " Marras , " the Commodore went on , " tell him what 's happened . If he 's half as hot as he sounds , he 's the boy to put on that job . Let him get in on a little of the work for the twenty percent . Ryter , come on . We " One moment , sir , " Quillan interrupted . He took Orca 's gun by the muzzle from his pocket , held it out to Velladon . " One of your men lost this thing . The one outside the door . If you do n't mind . . . he might pout if he does n't get it back . "  |p28The  fifth level of the Executive Block @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small . The tiny entry hall , on which two walk-in portals opened , led directly into the large room where the two Pendrake cubicles had been placed . One of the cubicles now stood open . To right and left , a narrow passage stretched away from the room , ending apparently in smaller rooms . Baldy Perk was perspiring profusely . " Now right here , " he said in a low voice , " was where I was standing . Movaine was over there , on the right of the cubicle , and Cooms was beside him . Rubero was a little behind me , hanging on to the punk  --  that Kinmarten . An ' the Duke "  --  he nodded at the wide doorspaceto the hall  --  " the Duke was standing back there . " All right . The punk 's opened the cubicle a crack , looking like he 's about to pass out while he 's doing it . This bearded guy , Eltak , stands in front of the cubicle , holding the gadget he controls the thing with .... " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Marras Cooms 's got it . " " How does it work ? " Baldy shook his head . " We ca n't figure it out . It 's got all kinds of little knobs and dials on it . Push this one an ' it squeaks , turn that one an ' it buzzes . Like that . " Quillan nodded . " All right . What happened ? " " Well , Movaine tells the old guy to go ahead an ' do the demonstrating . The old guy sort of grins and fiddles with the gadget . The rest cubicle door pops open an ' this thing comes pouring out . I never seen nothin ' like it ! It 's like a barn door with dirty fur on it . It swirls up an ' around an '  --  my God !  --  it wraps its upper end clean around poor Movaine . He never even screeches . " Then everything pops at once .

I'mp29halfway to the hall when Cooms tears past me like a rocket . The Duke an ' the others are already piling out through the portal . I get to the hall , an ' there 's this terrific smack in the room . I look back . . . an ' . . an ' . . . " Baldy paused and gulped . " And what ? " Quillan asked . " There , behind the cubicles , I see poor Movaine sticking halfway out of the wall ! " Baldy reported in a hushed whisper . " Halfway out of the wall ? " " From the waist up he 's in it ! From the waist down he 's dangling into the room ! I tell you , I never seen nothin ' like it . " " And this Hlat creature ... " " That 's gone . I figure the smack I heard was when it hit the wall flat , carrying Movaine . It went on into it . Movaine did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't . " " Well , " Quillan said after a pause , " in a way , Movaine got his demonstration . The Hlats can move through solid matter and carry other objects along with them , as advertised . If Yaco can work out how it 's done and build a gadget that does the same thing , they 're getting the Hlats cheap . What happened then ? " " I told Marras Cooms about Movaine , and he sent me and a half-dozen other boys back up here with riot guns to see what we could do for him . Which was nothin ' , of course . " Baldy gulped again . " We finally cut this end of him off with a beam and took it back down . " " The thing did n't show itself while you were here ? " Baldy shuddered and said , " Naw . " " And the technician  --  Eltak  --  was dead ? " " Sure . Hole in his head you could shove your fist in . " " Somebody , " Quillan observed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " The Duke did  --  first thing after we got back to the fourth level . "  | " So the Hlat 's on the loose , and all we really have at the moment are the cubicles  --  and Rest Warden Kinmarten . Where 's he , by the way ? " " He tried to take off when we got down to Level Four , an ' somebody cold-conked him . The doc says he ought to be coming around again pretty soon . " Quillan grunted , shoved the Miam Devil Special into its holster , said , " All right , you stay here where you can watch the room and those passages and the hall . If you feel the floor moving under you , scream . I 'll take a look at the cubicle . " Lady Pendrake 's rest cubicle was about half as big again as a standard one ; but , aside from one detail , its outer settings , instruments , and operating devices appearednormal . The modification was a recess almost six feet long and a foot wide and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either to the room or to the interior of the rest cubicle , but not simultaneously to both . Quillan already knew its purpose ; the supposed other cubicle was a camouflaged food locker , containing fifty-pound slabs of sea beef , each of which represented a meal for the Hlat . The recess made it possible to feed it without allowing it to be seen , or , possibly , attempting to emerge . Kinmarten 's nervousness , as reported by his wife , seemed understandable . Any rest warden might get disturbed over such a charge . Quillan asked over his shoulder , " Anyone find out yet why the things ca n't get out of a closed rest cubicle ? " " Yeah , " Baldy Perk said . " Kinmarten says it 's the cubicle 's defense fields . They could get through the material . They ca n't get through the field . " " Someone think to energize the Executive Block 's battle fields ? " Quillan inquired . " Yeah . Velladon took care of that before he came screaming up to the third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So it ca n't slip out of the Block unless it shows itself down on the ground level when the entry lock 's open . " " Yeah , " Baldy muttered . " But I du n no . Is that good ? " Quillan looked at him . " Well , we would like it back . " " Why ? There 's fifty more coming in on the liner tonight . " " We do n't have the fifty yet . If someone louses up that detail " Yawk ! " Baldy said faintly . There was a crash of sound as his riot gun went off . Quillan spun about , hair bristling , gun out . " What happened ? " " I swear , " Baldy said , white-faced , " I saw somethingmoving along that passage ! " Quillan looked , saw nothing , slowly replaced the gun . " Baldy , " he said , " if you think you see it again , just say so . That 's an order ! If it comes at us , we get out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have to . If we kill it , it 's no good to us . Got that ? " " Yeah , " Baldy said . " But I got an idea now , Bad News . " He nodded at the other cubicle . " Let 's leave that meat box open ! " " Why ? " " If it 's hungry , " Baldy explained simply , " I 'd sooner it wrapped itself around a few hunks of sea beef , an ' not around me . " Quillan punched him encouragingly in the shoulder . " Baldy , " he said , " in your own way , you have had an idea ! But we wo n't leave the meat box open . When Kinmarten wakes up , I want him to show me how to bait this cubicle with a piece of sea beef , so it 'll snap shut if the Hlat goes inside . Meanwhile , it wo n't hurt if it gets a little hungry . " " That , " said Baldy , " is n't the way I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hundred and fifty people in the Executive Block at present , " Quillan pointed out.  | " Look at it that way . Even if the thing keeps stuffing away , your odds are pretty good , Baldy . " Baldy shuddered . Aside from a dark bruise high on his forehead , Brock Kinmarten showed no direct effects of having been knocked out . However , his face was strained and his voice not entirely steady . It was obvious that the young rest warden never had been in a similarly unnerving situation before . But he was making a valiant effort not to appear frightened and , at the same time , to indicate that he would cooperate to the best of his ability with his captors . He 'd regained consciousness by the time Quillan and Perk returned to the fourth level ; and Quillan suggestedbringing him to Marras Cooms 's private quartersfor questioning . The Brotherhood chief agreed ; he was primarily interested in finding out how the Hlat-control device functioned ... . Kinmarten shook his head . He knew nothing about the instrument , he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was very unfortunate that Eltak had been killed , because Eltak undoubtedly could have told them all they wanted to know about it . If what he had told Kinmarten was true , Eltak had been directly involved in the development of the device . " He was a scientist ? " Cooms said , fiddling absently with the mysterious cylindrical object . " No , sir . But , again , if what he told me was the truth , he was the man who actually discovered these Hlats . At least , he was the first man to discover them who was n't immediately killed by them . " Cooms glanced at Quillan , asked , " Where was that ? " " He did n't tell me , " Kinmarten said . " And I didn'treally want to know . I was anxious to get our convoy toits destination , and then to be relieved of the assign/ment . I  --  well , I 've been trained to act as rest warden to human beings , after all , not to monstrosities ! " He produced an uncertain smile , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The smile quickly faded . " You 've no idea at all about the place they came from ? " Cooms asked . " Oh , yes , sir . Eltak talked a great deal about the Hlats , and actually  --  except for its location  --  gave me a fairly good picture of what the planet is like . It 's an uncolonized world , of course , and terratype or very nearly so , because Eltak lived there for fifteen years with only a minimum of equipment . The Hlats are confined to a single large island . He discovered them by accident and " What was he doing there ? " " Well , he came from Hyles-Frisian . He was a crimuh , a sort of pirate . His ship got badly damaged in a fight and cracked up trying to land on this world . His crew was killed , and Eltak could n't leave again . When he discovered the Hlats and noticed their odd ability , he kept out of their way and observed them . He found out they had a means of communicating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That stopped them from harming him , and eventually , he said , he was using them like hunting dogs . They were accustomed to cooperating with one another , because when there was some animal around that was too large for one of them to handle , they would attack it in a group .... " He went on for another minute or two on the subject . The Hlats  --  the word meant " rock lion " in a HylesFrisiandialect , describing a carnivorous animal with some superficial resemblance to the creatures Eltak had happened on  --  frequented the seacoast and submergedthemselves in sand , rocks , and debris , whipping up out of it to seize some food animal , and taking it down with them again to devour it at leisure.  |p34Quillan  interrupted . " You heard what happened to the man it attacked on the fifth level ? " " Yes , sir . " " Why would the thing have left him half outside the wall as it did ? " Kinmarten said that it must simply have been moving too fast . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pause itself , but it needed a little time to restructurean object it was carrying to do the same . No more time , however , than three or four seconds  --  depending more on the nature of the object than on its size , according to Eltak . " It can restructure anything in that manner ? " Quillanasked . " Well , sir , I do n't know . I suppose there might be limitations to its ability . Eltak told me the one we were escorting had been the subject of extensive experimentationduring the past year , and that the results had been very satisfactory . " " Suppose it carries a living man through a wall . Will the man still be alive when he comes out the other side , assuming the Hlat does n't kill him deliberately ? " " Yes , sir . The process itself would n't hurt him . " Quillan glanced at Cooms . " You know , " he said , " we might be letting Yaco off too cheaply ! " Cooms raised a warning eyebrow . Quillan grinned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough . . . . Why did Eltak tell the creature to attack , Kin-marten ? " " Sir , I do n't know , " Kinmarten said . " He was a man of rather violent nature . My impression , however , was that he was simply attempting to obtain a hostage . " " How did he get off that island with the Hlat ? " " A University League expedition was investigating the planet . Eltak contacted them and obtained the guarantee of a large cash settlement in return for whatp35he could tell them about the Hlats . They took him and this one specimen along for study . " " What about the Hlats on the Camelot ? " " Eltak said those had been quite recently trapped on the island . " Cooms ran his fingers over the cylinder , producing a rapid series of squeaks and whistles . " That 's one thing Yaco may not like , " he observed . " They wo n't have a monopoly . " Quillan shook his head . " Their scientists do n't have to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the news breaks  --  if the Federation ever intends to break it  --  Yaco will have at least a five-year start on everyone else . That 's all an outfit like that needs . " He looked at Kinmarten . " Any little thing you have n't thought to tell us , friend ? " he inquired pleasantly . A thin film of sweat showed suddenly on Kinmarten 's forehead . " No , sir , " he said . " I 've really told you everything I know . I " Might try him under dope , " Cooms said absently . " Uh-uh , " said Quillan . " I want him wide awake to help me bait the cubicle . Has Velladon shown any indicationof becoming willing to cooperate in hunting for the thing ? " Cooms gestured with his head . " Ask Fluel there ! I sent him down to try to patch things up with the Com-modore . " Quillan glanced around . The Duke was lounging in the doorway . He grinned slightly , said , " Velladon 's still peeved at us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did he mention his wife 's also a rest warden , and on the Star ? " Brock Kinmarten went utterly white . Cooms looked at him , said softly , " No , that must have slipped his mind . "  |p36Fluel  said , " No doubt . Ryter says they should have her picked up within half an hour . When they bring her in , we really must check on how candid Kinmarten'sbeen about everything . " The rest warden said in a voice that shook uncontrollably , " Gentlemen , my wife knows absolutely nothing about these matters ! I swear it ! She . Quillan stood up . " Well , I 'll go see if I can get Velladoninto a better mood . Are you keeping that Hlattalker , Cooms ? " Cooms smiled . " I am . " " Marras figures , " the Duke 's flat voice explained , " that if the thing comes into the room and he squeaks at it a few times , he wo n't get hurt . " " That 's possible , " Cooms said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hang on to it . " " Well , I would n't play around with those buttons too much , " Quillan observed . " Why not ? " " You might get lucky and tap out some pattern that spells Come to dinner ! ' in the Hlat 's vocabulary . " There were considerably more men in evidence on Level Two than on the fourth , and fewer signs of nervousness . The Star men had been told of the Hlat 's escape , but were n't taking it too seriously . Quillan was conducted to the Commodore and favored with an alarmingly toothy grin . Ryter , the security chief , joined them a few seconds later . Apparently , Velladon had summoned him . Velladon said , " Ryter here 's made a few transmitter calls . We hear Pappy Boltan pulled his outfit out of the Orado area about a month ago . Present whereabouts unknown . Hagready went off on some hush-hush job at around the same time . " Quillan smiled . " Uh-huh ! So he did . "  | " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of things about you personally . " He produced a thin smile . " You lead a busy and apparently profitable life . " " Business is fair , " Quillan agreed . " But it can always he improved . " The Commodore turned on the big grin . " So all right , " he growled . " You 're clear . We rather liked what we learned . Eh , Ryter ? " Ryter nodded . " This Brotherhood of Beldon , now . . . " The Commodoreshook his head heavily . Quillan was silent a moment . " They might be gettingsloppy , " he said . " I do n't know . It 's one possibility . They used to be a rather sharp outfit , you know . " " That 's what I 'd heard ! " Velladon chewed savagely on his mustache , asked finally , " What 's another pos-sibility ? " Quillan leaned back in his chair . " Just a feeling , so far . But the business with the cubicle upstairs might have angles that were n't mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mind amplifying that ? " " Cooms told me , " Quillan said , " that Nome Lancion had given Movaine instructions to make a test with Lady Pendrake on the quiet and find out if those creaturesactually can do what they 're supposed to do . I think he was telling the truth . Nome tends to be overcautiouswhen it 's a really big deal . Unless he 's sure of the Hlats , he would n't want to be involved in a thing like blowing up the Star and the liner . " The Commodore scowled absently . " Uh-huh , " he said . " He knows we ca n't back out of it . . . . " " All right . The Brotherhood 's full of ambitious men . Behind Lancion , Movaine was top man . Cooms behind him , Fluel behind Cooms . . . . Suppose that Hlatcontroldevice Cooms is hanging on to so tightly is n't as entirely incomprehensible as they make it out to be . Suppose Cooms makes a deal with Eltak . Eltak tickles the gadget , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is killed by Fluel a couple of minutes later , supposedly for blowing his top and killing the man who knew how to control the Hlat . " Ryter cleared his throat . " Fluel was Movaine 's gun . " " So he was . Would you want him to be yours ? " Ryter grinned , shook his head . Quillan looked back at Velladon . " How well are you actually covered against the Brotherhood ? " " Well , that part 's airtight , " the Commodore said . " We 've got ' em outgunned at present . When the liner lands , we 'll be about even . But Lancion wo n't start anything . We 're too even . Once we 're clear of the Star , we do n't meet again . We deal with Yaco individually . The Brotherhood has the Hlats , and we have the trained Federation technicians accompanying them , who . . . who ... " " Who alone are supposed to be able to inform Yaco how to control the Hlats , " Ryter finished for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By God ! " the Commodore said softly . " Well , it 's only a possibility that somebody 's playing dirty , " Quillan remarked . " We 'd want to be sure of it . But if anyone can handle a Hlat with that control instrument , the Brotherhood has an advantage now that it is n't talking about  --  it can offer Yaco everything Yaco needs in one package . Of course , Yaco might still be willing to pay for the Hlat technicians . If it did n't , you and Ryter could make the same kind of trouble for it that my friends can . " The color was draining slowly from Velladon 's face . " There 's a difference , " he said . " If we threaten to make trouble for Yaco , they 'd see to it that our present employers learn that Ryter and I are still alive . " " That 's the Mooleys , eh ? "  | " Yes . " " Tough . " Quillan knuckled his chin reflectively . " Well , let 's put it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of problem , but if things worked out so that we 'd have something more substantial than nuisance value to offer Yaco , we 'd prefer it , of course . " Velladon nodded . " Cooperation appears indicated , eh ? " " That 's my feeling . " " You 've made a deal , " Velladon said . " Any immediatesuggestions ? " Quillan nodded . " There were a few things I had in mind . Of course , we do n't want to make a mistake . It 's still almost five hours before the Camelot pulls in , and until she does you 're way ahead on firepower . I would n't make any accusations just now . But you might mention to Cooms you 'd like to borrow the Hlat gadget to have it examined by your technicians . The way he reacts should tell us something . If he balks , the matter need n't be pushed too hard at the moment  --  it 's a tossup whether you or the Brotherhood has a better claim to the thing . " But then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cubicle . I talked with him while Cooms and Fluel were around , but he may have been briefed on what to say . Cooms mentioned doping him , which could be a convenient way of keeping him shut up , assuming he knows more than he 's told . He 's one of the personnel you 're to offer Yaco . I think you can insist on having Kinmarten handed over to you immediately . It should be interesting again to see how Cooms reacts . " Velladon 's big head nodded vigorously . " Good idea ! " " By the way , " Quillan said , " Fluel mentioned you 've been looking for Kinmarten 's wife , the second rest warden on the Pendrake convoy . Found her yet ? " " Not a trace , so far , " Ryter said.  | " That 's a little surprising , too , is n't it ? " " Under the circumstances , " the Commodore said , " it might not be surprising at all ! " He 'd regained his color , was beginning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , " Quillan said soothingly , " we do n't know . It 's just that things do begin to add up a little . . . . There 's one other point . We should do something immediately about catching that Hlat . " Velladon grunted , shrugged , picked at his teeth with his thumbnail . " It would be best to get it back in its cubicle , of course . But I 'm not worrying about it . After all , it 's just an animal . Even the light hardware those Beldon fancy Dans carry should handle it . You use a man-size gun , I see . So do I. If it shows up around here and makes trouble , it gets smeared . And that will be that . There 're fifty more of the beasts on the Camelot . " Quillan nodded . " We do n't need this particular Hlat . But there 's the possibility that it 's being controlled by the Brotherhood . It 's had previous conditioning . That might make it more than just another animal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commodore considered . " You 're right , " he decided . " What do you want to do about it ? " " Baiting the cubicle on the fifth level might work . But I 'm not counting on it . Are there life-detectors in the Star 's security supplies ? " Ryter nodded . " We have a couple of dozen of them , but not in the Executive Block . They were left in the security building . " Velladon stood up . " You stay here with Ryter , " he told Quillan . " There 're a couple of other things I want to go over with you two . I 'll order the life-detectors from the office here  --  second passage down , is n't it , Ryter ? . . . And , Ryter , I have another idea . I 'm pulling the man in space-armor off the subspace portal andp41detailing him to Level Five . " He grinned at Quillan .

The two security guards stationed at the door to the second level office came to attention as he approached , saluted smartly . He grunted , went in without returning the salute , and started over toward the ComWeb on a desk at the far end of the big room , skirting the long , dusty-looking black rug beside one wall . Velladon unbuckled his gun belt , placed it on the desk , sat down and switched on the ComWeb . Behind him , the black rug stirred silently and rose up . " You called that one almost too well ! " Ryter was sayingunsteadily seven or eight minutes later . Quillan shook his head , poked at the Commodore 's gun belt on the desk , looked about the silent office , and back at the door where a small group of security men stood staring in at them .

" He added bleakly , " In fact , the only way they couldhave left this section , or been taken from it , withoutp42being seen by a dozen men , is through the walls . There 's no question about that ! " " In other words , the Hlat got them . " " What else ? " " Uh-huh . That 's how it looks . " Quillan stood in scowling concentration for a moment , jerked his head toward the door . " Will they keep quiet ? " " If I tell them to . " " Then let 's not list the Commodore among the missing . If anybody needs to know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care of some business there . " The security chief stared at him . " You figure Cooms is trying to work from the top down ? " " It would n't be a bad approach , would it ? If he can control the Hlat to that extent . " Ryter licked his lips . " With Velladon , you , and a few other key men gone , " Quillan went on , " he could have this outfit demoralized enough to make up for the difference in the number of guns  --  especially with the Hlat on his team . I think you 'd better keep a handful of the best boys you have around glued to your back from now on ! " Ryter said grimly , " I intend to ! What about your-self ? " Quillan shook his head .

"  | " There was nothing I could put a finger on directly , " Quillan told Marras Cooms a few minutes later . " But Velladon and Ryter acted entirely too self-satisfied to suit me . I have the impression they 've got something undesirable set up . What it is , I do n't know . " The Brotherhood chief gnawed his lower lip reflectively . He did n't seem too disturbed . He might be thoroughly afraid of the Hlat ; but the Hlat was an uncannymenace , something outside his experience .

He 's got you outgunned two to one , but if he 's thinking of jumping you before Lancion gets here , he stands to lose more men than he can afford . It could cost him the operation . " Cooms was silent a few seconds , face working thoughtfully . " Actually , " he said then , " the Commodore may have us outgunned here by something like four to one . In that case , he could afford to lose quite a few men . In fact , he 'd prefer to lose them to cut down the number involved in the final split . " Quillan looked startled . " How 's that ?

But if he 's had ideas about eliminating us from the game , those men could still be around . "  | Quillan grunted . " That could explain something that seemed a little odd to me . " " Yes ? What ? " " After they discovered the Hlat had picked up two of their men down there , I tried to get hold of Velladon again . Ryter told me the Commodore was n't in the Executive Block . He had business to take care of in the Star and would n't be available for a while . I wondered what could be important enough to take him away at present .... " " I 'm way ahead of you , " Cooms said . His expression had hardened . " It does n't look good . But , at least , we 'll know immediately if he tries to bring in reinforcements . Half the men posted at the entrance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a glance , nodded at the wall across from them . " That 's a portal over there , Marras . How many of them on this level ? " " Three or four . Why ? The outportals are plugged off , man ! Sealed . Fluel went over them when we moved in . " " Sure they 're sealed . " Quillan stood up , went to the portal , stood looking at the panel beside it , pressed on it here and there , and removed it . " Come over here , friend ! I suppose portal work 's been out of your line . " He took a pocketbook-sized tool kit from a slit in his belt , snapped it open . About a minute later , the lifeless VACANT sign above the portal flickered twice , then acquired a steady white glow . " Portal in operation ! " Quillan announced . " I 'll seal it off again now . But that should give you the idea of just how long it takes to get a thing like that unplugged . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somebodyportal to this level from the Star while the exits register sealed ? " " Any time  --  if the mechanisms are set for that pur/pose . The Duke 's your engineer , is n't he ? Have him check it out . He should have thought of the point him-'cif . Anyway , Velladon can bring in as many men as he likes to his own level without using the main entrance . " I le considered . " I did n't see anything to indicate he 's started doing it . " Cooms shrugged irritably . " That means nothing ! It would be easy enough to keep half a hundred men hidden away on any of the lower levels . " " I suppose that 's right . Well , if the Commodore wants to play rough , you should have some warning , anyway . " " What kind of warning ? " " Kinmarten and the Hlat-talking gadget , " Quillan said . " Velladon will want both of them in his hands and out of the way , where they ca n't get hurt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a few seconds . " Just before you got back here , " he said slowly then , " Ryter was on the ComWeb . He said he 'd heard you wanted Kinmarten 's help in baiting the rest cubicle for the Hlat . " " Yes , I told them about that . " " When you 're done with it , you 're to take Kinmarten to the third level . The Commodore 's decided he wants custody of the rest warden  --  and his wife , whenever she 's located . " " Did you agree ? " Cooms shrugged . " No reason not to . Velladon 's supposed to deliver the Hlats ' attendants to Yaco . " He paused . " Ryter also asked me to turn the Hlat-talker over to them . " Quillan grunted . " You 're not giving them that ? " " No , I 'm not . " " Well , " Quillan said after a moment , " that does n't necessarily mean we 're in trouble with the Star group . But it does mean , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He stood up . " I 'll collect Kinmarten and see what we can do with the cubicle . Then I 'll take him down to the third level . If I spot anything there that looks suspicious , I 'll get word to you . " " I never , " stated Orca , unconsciously echoing Baldy Perk 's comment , " saw anything like it ! " The Commodore'schunky little gunman was ashen-faced . The circle of security men standing around him looked no happier than he did . Most of them were staring down at the empty lower section of a suit of space armor which appeared to have been separated with a neat diagonal slice from its upper part . " Let 's get it straight , " Ryter said shakily . " You say this half of the suit was lying against the wall like that ? " " Not exactly , " Quillan told him . " When we got up to the fifth level , the suit was stuck against the wall  --  like that  --  about eight feet above the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are . When Kinmarten and Orca and I finally got the suit worked away from the wall , I expected we 'd find half the body of the guard still inside . But he 'd vanished . " Ryter cleared his throat . " Apparently , " he said , " the creature drew the upper section of the suit into the wall by whatever means it uses , then stopped applying the transforming process to the metal , and simply moved on with the upper part of the suit man been up there ? " " Not more than twenty minutes , " Ryter told him . " You remember the Commodore decided the guard stationed at the subspace portal should be transferred to the fifth level . It did seem he 'd be safe enough in space armor " " He had two grenades ! " Orca burst out . " The suit 's got spray guns ! How could it get him that way ? "  | " Friend , " Quillan said , " grenades and spray guns may not be worth much if you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Orca glared speechlessly at him . Ryter said , " All right ! We 've lost another man . We 're not going to lose any more . Get everyone who is n't on essential guard duty to the main room , and split ' em up into life-detector units ! Five men to each detail , one to handle the detector , four to stay with him , guns out . If the thing comes back to this level , we want it spotted the instant it arrives . . . . Orca , you stay here  --  and keep your gun out ! " The men filed out hurriedly . Ryter turned to Quillan . " Were you able to get the cubicle baited ? " Quillan nodded . " Kinmarten figured out how the thing should be set for the purpose . If the Hlat goes in After the sea beef , it 's trapped . Of course , if the hunting it 's been doing was for food , it might n't be interested in the beef . " " We do n't know , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing was for food . " " No . . . . Did you manage to get the control device from Cooms ? " Ryter shook his head . " He refused to hand it over . " " If you tried to take it from him , " Quillan said , " you might have a showdown on your hands . " " And if this keeps on , " Ryter said , " I 'd prefer a showdown ! Another few rounds of trouble with the Hlat , and the entire operation could blow up in our faces ! he men are n't used to this kind of thing . It 's shaking them up . If we 've got to take care of the Brotherhood , I 'd hither do it while I still have an organized group . Where did you leave Kinmarten , by the way ? " " Back in that little room , with his two guards , " said Lillian . " Well , he should be all right there . We ca n't spare  --  " It vter 's body jerked violently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single thudding crash somewhere on the level . Then shouts and cursing . " Main hall ! " Quillan said . " Come on ! " The main hall was a jumble of excitedly jabbering Star men when they arrived . Guns waved about , and the various groups showed a marked tendency to stand with their backs to one another and their faces toward the walls . Ryter 's voice rose in a shout that momentarily shut off the hubbub . " What 's going on ? " Men turned ; hands pointed ; voices babbled again . Someone nearby said sharply and distinctly : " . . . saw it drop right out of the ceiling ! " Farther down the hall , another group shifted aside enough to disclose it had been standing about something which looked like the empty shell of a gigantic black beetle . The missing section of the suit of space armor had been returned . But not its occupant ... . Quillan moved back a step , turned , went back down the passage from which they had emerged , pulling the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commotioncontinued ; Ryter was shouting something about getting the life-detector units over there . Quillan went left down the first intersecting corridor , right again on the following one , keeping the gun raised slightly before him . Coming around the next corner , he saw the man on guard over the portal connecting the building levels facing him , gun pointed . " What happened ? " the guard asked shakily . Quillan shook his head , coming up . " The damn thing got another one of our men ! " The guard made a shocked breathing sound , and lowered his gun a little . Quillan raised his a little ; the Miam Devil grunted , and the guard sighed and went down . Quillan went past him along the hall , stoppedp49two doors beyond the portal , and rapped on the locked door . " Quillan here ! " he called . " Open up ! " The door opened a crack , and one of Kinmarten 's guards looked out questioningly . Quillan shot him through the head , slammed on into the room across the collapsing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fired again , and slid the gun back into the holster . Kinmarten , standing beside a table six feet away , right hand gripping a heavy ashtray , stared at him in whitefacedshock . " Take it easy , chum ! " Quillan said , turning toward him with a reassuring grin . " I He ducked hurriedly as the ashtray whirled through the air toward his head . An instant later , a large fist smacked the side of Kinmarten 's jaw . The rest warden settled limply to the floor . " Hated to do that , pal ! " Quillan muttered , stooping over him . " But things are rough all over right now . " He hauled Kinmarten upright , bent , and had the unconsciousyoung man across his shoulder . The hall was still empty except for the body of the portal guard . Quillan laid Kinmarten on the floor before the portal , hauled the guard off into the room , and pulled the door to the room shut behind him as he came out . Picking up Kinmarten , he stepped into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A moment later , he moved out into the small dim entry hall on the fifth level , the gun again in his right hand . He stood there silently for some seconds , looking about and listening . The baited cubicle yawned widely at him from the center of the big room . Nothing seemed to be stirring . Kinmarten went back to the floor . Quillan turned to the sealed second portal , which normally connected the fifth level to the outer areas of the Star , and removed the panel that shielded its mechanisms.  |p50He  had the outportal unsealed in considerably less than a minute , slapped the panel gently into place , and moved back to Kinmarten . He bent down to pick him up , then straightened again , very quietly , turning his head . He was almost certain there had been a flickering of shadowy motion at the edge of his vision a moment before , somewhere beyond the big cube of the Hlat 's food locker . He remained perfectly still , the Miami Devil ready , every sense straining for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approaching him stealthily now , gliding beneath the surfaces of floor or ceiling or walls like an underwater swimmer . But a minute passed and nothing happened . He went down on one knee beside Kinmarten , the gun still in his right hand . With his left , he carefully wrestled the rest warden back up across his shoulder , came upright , moved three slow steps to the side , and disappeared in the outportal . Reetal Destone unlocked the entry door to her suite and stepped hurriedly inside , letting the door slide shut behind her . She crossed the room to the ComWeb stand and switched on the playback . There was a succession of tinkling tones which indicated nothing had been recorded . Reetal shut the instrument off again , frowning . No further messages from Heraga . And none from Quillan . She shook her head , feeling a surge of sharp anxiety , glanced at her watch and told herself that , after all , less then two hours had passed since Quillan entered the Executive Block . Heraga reported there were no indicationsof disturbance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his way out . So Quillan , at any rate , seemed to have succeeded in bluffing his way into the upper levels.  |p51I  t remained a desperate play , at best . . . . Rectal went down the short passage to her bedroom . As she came into the room , her arms were caught from the side at the elbows , pulled suddenly and painfully togetherbehind her . She stood still , frozen with shock . " In a hurry , sweetheart ? " Fluel 's flat , nasal voice inquired . Rectal managed a breathless giggle . " Duke ! My ( std , you startled me ! How did you get in ? " She felt one hand move up her arm to her shoulder . Then she was swung about deftly and irresistibly , held pinned back against the wall , still unable to move her arms . Ile looked at her a moment , asked drily , " Where are you hiding it this time ? " the gave him a bewildered frown . " Hiding what ? " " I 've heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some shape or form . " Rectal shook her head , eyes widening . " Duke , what 's the matter ? I Ile let go of her suddenly . His slap exploded against is side of her face . Reetal cried out , dropping her headtween her hands . Immediately he had her wrists again , and her fingers were jerked away from the jeweled ornament in her hair . " So that 's where ! " Fluel said . " Thought that might n't be just decorative . Do n't get smart again , sweetheart . Just stay quiet . " She stayed quiet , wincing a little as he plucked the device from her hair . He turned it around in his fingers , examining it , smiled , slid it into an inside pocket , took her arm again . " Let 's go to the front room , Reetal , " he said almost pleasantly . " We 've got a few things to take cane of . " A minute later , she was seated on a lounger , her ists fastened right and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recorder on the floor beside her.  | " This is a crowded evening , sweetheart , " he remarked . " Which is lucky for you , as it happens . 1 have to rush matters along . In a minute , I 'll snap the recorder on , so you can answer questions  --  no , keep quiet ! Just listen closely now , so you 'll know what the right answers are . If you get rattled and gum things up , the Duke 's going to get annoyed . " He sat down a few feet away , hitched his shoulders to straighten the silver jacket , and lit a cigarette . " A little while after Bad News Quillan turned up over there , " he went on conversationally , " a few things occurred to me . One of them was that a couple of years ago you and he were operating around Beldon at the same time . I thought , well , maybe you knew each other , maybe not . And then " Duke , " Reetal said uncertainly , " just what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . " He reached over , tapped her knee with his fingertips . " Of course , if you want to get slapped around , all right . Otherwise , do n't interrupt again . Like I said , you 're in luck  --  I do n't have too much time to spend here . You 're getting off very easy . Now just listen . " Bad News knew a lot about our operation and had a story to explain that . If the story was straight , we could n't touch him . But I was wondering about the two of you happening to be on the Star again at the same time . A team maybe , eh ? But he did n't mention you as being in on the deal . So what was the idea ? " And then , sweetheart , I remembered something else  --  and that tied it in ! Know that little jolt people sometimes get when they 're dropping off to sleep ? Of course . Know another time they sometimes get it ? When they 're snapping back out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly I 'd felt a little jolt like that while we were talking today . Could have been a reflex of some kind . Of course , it did n't occur to me atp53the time you might be pulling a lousy stunt like Truth on old Duke . Why take a chance on getting your neck broken ? " Rut , sweetheart , that 's the tie-in ! Quillan has n't told it straight . He 's got no backing . He 's on his own . ' There 's no gang outside that knows all about our little deal ! He got his information right here , from you . And you got it from dumb old Duke , eh ? " " Duke , " Reetal said quietly , " can I ask just one thin ; ? " I lc stared bleakly at her , then grinned . " It 's my flight to be big-hearted , I guess . Go ahead . " " I 'm not trying to argue . But all this simply does n't make sense ! If I did n't know about this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to feed you Truth ? There 'd be almost a fifty-fifty chance that you 'd Spot it immediately . Why should I take such a risk ? What would I be after ? Do n't you see ? " Fluel shrugged , dropped his cigarette and ground h carefully into the carpet with the tip of his shoe . " You 'll start answering those questions yourself al -- most immediately , sweetheart ! Let 's not worry about it . let me finish . Something happened to Movaine a couple of hours ago . Nobody 's fault . And something else happened to Marras Cooms just now . That puts me in charge of the operation here . Nice , is n't it ? When we found Cooms lying in the hall with a hole through his stupid head , I told Baldy Perk it looked like Bad News had thrown in with the Star outfit and done it . Know Haldy ? He 's Cooms 's personal gun . Not what you 'd call to bright , and he 's mighty hot now about Cooms . I left him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next time he shows up . Well and good . The boys . know Bad News 's rep too well to try asking him questions . They wo n't take chances with him . They 'll just run him down together the instant they see him . " Ile paused to scuff his shoe over the mark the ciga/rette had left on the carpet . " But there 's Nome Lancion , now , " he went on . " He kind of liked Cooms , and he might get suspicious . When there 's a sudden vacancy in the organization like that , Nome takes a good look first at the man next in line . He likes to be sure the facts are as stated . " So now you know the kind of answers from you 1 want to hear go down on the recorder , sweetheart . Be sure they sound right . I do n't want to waste time on replays . You and Quillan were here on the Star . You got some idea of what was happening , realized you were due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no way out of it for you unless you could stop the operation . . . . You do n't , by the way , mention getting any of that from me . I do n't want Lancion to think I 'm getting stupid . You and Quillan cooked up his story , and he managed to get into the Executive Block . The idea being to knock off as many of the leaders as he could , and generally mess things up . " Fluel picked up the recorder , stood up , and placed it on the chair . " That 's all you have to remember . You 're a smart girl  --  you can fill in the details any way you like . Now let 's get started .... " Reetal stared at him silently for an instant , a muscle beginning to twitch in her cheek . " If I do that , " she said , " if I give you a story Nome will like , what happens next ? " Fluel shrugged . " Just what you 're thinking happens next . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Might as well get used to the idea . You 'd be dead anyhow four , five hours later , so that should n't make too much difference . What makes a lot of difference is just how unpleasant it can get . " She drew a long breath . " Duke , I --  " " You 're stalling , sweetheart . "  | " Duke , give me a break . I really did n't know a thing about this . " Ile looked down at her . " I gave you a break , " he said . " You 've wasted it . Now we 'll try it the other way . If we work a few squeals into the recording , that 'll make it More convincing to Lancion . He 'll figure little Reetal 's the type who would n't spill a thing like that without mime pressure . " He grinned . " And that reminds me ! When you 're talking for the record , use your own " My own voice ? " she half whispered . " Nome will remember what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are part of your stock In trade . You might think it was cute if Nome got towondering after you were dead whether that really bud been you talking . Do n't try it , sweetheart . " Ile took a glove from his jacket pocket , slipped it over his left hand , flexing his fingers to work it intoposition . Reetal 's eyes fastened on the rounded metal tips capping thumb , forefinger , and middle finger of the love . Her face went gray . " Duke , " she said . " No " Shut up . " He brought out a strip of transparent lactic , moved over to her . The gloved hand went into rr hair , gripped it , turned her face up . He laid theplastic gag lengthwise over her mouth , pressed it down ml released it . Reetal closed her eyes . " That 'll keep it shut , " he said . " Now  --  " His right hand clamped about the back of her neck , forcing her head down and forward almost to her knees . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle finger ' touched the skin at a point just above her shoulder blades . " Right there , " Fluel said . The finger stiffened , drove down . Rectal jerked violently , twisted , squirmed sideways ,  |p56wrists  straining against the grip of the armrests . Her breath burst from her nostrils , followed by squeezed whining noises . The metal-capped finger continued to grind against the nerve center it had found . " Thirty , " Fluel said at last . He drew his hand back , pulled her upright again , peeled the gag from her lips . " Only thirty seconds , sweetheart ! Think you 'd sooner play along now ? " Reetal 's head nodded . " Fine . Give you a minute to steady up . This does n't really waste much time , you see . . . . " He took up the recorder , sat down on the chair again , watching her . She was breathing raggedly and shallowly , eyes wide and incredulous . She did n't look at him . The Duke lit another cigarette . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stalling because you hoped old Bad News might show up , forget it . If the boys have n't gunned him down by now , he 's tied up on a job the Commodore gave him to do . He 'll be busy another hour or two on that . He He checked himself . A central section of the wall paneling across the room from him had just dilated open . Old Bad News stood in the concealed suite portal , Rest Warden Kinmarten slung across his shoulder . Both men moved instantly . Fluel 's long legs bounced him sideways out of the chair , right hand darting under his coat , coming out with a gun . Quillan twisted sharply to the left to get Kinmarten out of the way . The big Miam Devil seemed to jump into his hand . Both guns spoke together . Fluel 's gun thudded to the carpet . The Duke said , " Ah-aa-ah ! " in a surprised voice , rolled up his eyes , and followed the gun down . Quillan said , shocked , " My God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair . "  |p57He  became very solicitous then  --  after first ascertainingthat Fluel had left the Executive Block unaccompanied , on personal business . He located a painkillerspray in Reetal 's bedroom and applied it to the bruised area below the back of her neck . She was just he Ti n n i ng to relax gratefully , as the warm glow of the spray washed out the pain and the feeling of paralysis , when Kinmarten , lying on the carpet nearby , began to stir and mutter . Quillan hastily put down the spray . " Watch him ! " he cautioned . " I 'll be right back . If he tits up , yell . He 's a bit wild at the moment . If he wakes up and sees the Duke lying there , he 'll start climbing the walls . " " What  --  " Reetal began . But he was gone down the hall . Ile returned immediately with a glass of water , went down on one knee beside Kinmarten , slid an arm under the rest warden 's shoulder , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , old pal ! " he said loudly . " Come on , wake up ! Got something good for you here . " " What are you giving him ? " Reetal asked , cautiously massaging the back of her neck . " Knockout drops . I already had to lay him out once . We want to lock him up with his wife now , and if he conies to and tells her what 's happened , they 'll both be out of their minds by the time we come to let themoutIle broke off . Kinmarten 's eyelids were fluttering . Quillan raised the glass to his lips . " Here you are , pal , " he said in a deep , soothing voice . " Drink it ! It 'll make you feel a lot better . " Kinmarten swallowed obediently , swallowed again . Ills eyelids stopped fluttering . Quillan lowered him back to the floor.  | " That ought to do it , " he said . " What , " Reetal asked , " did happen ? The Duke " Tell you as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way . I have to get back to the Executive Block . Things are sort of teetering on the edge there ! " He jerked his head at Fluel 's body . " I want to know about him , too , of course . Think you can walk now ? " Reetal groaned . " I can try , " she said . They found Solvey Kinmarten dissolved in tears once more . She flung herself on her husband 's body when Quillan placed him on the bed . " What have those beasts done to Brock ? " she demanded fiercely . " Nothing very bad , " Quillan said soothingly . " He 's , um , under sedation at the moment , that 's all . We 've got him away from them now , and he 's safe  --  look at it that way ! You stay here and take care of him . We 'll have the whole deal cleared up before morning , doll . Then you can both come out of hiding again . " He gave her an encouraging wink . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " " No trouble , really . But we 'd better get back to work on the thing .... " They were back in Reetal 's suite moments later . " Nice little characters , those two ! " Quillan observed . He sighed . " Well , if the works blow up , they 'll never know it . Now , then  --  " He rattled through a brief account of events in the Executive Block , listened to Reetal 's report on the Duke 's visit , scratched his jaw reflectively . " That might help ! " he remarked . " They 're about ready to jump down each other 's throats over there right now . A couple more pushes  --  " He stood staring down at the Duke 's body for a moment . Blood soiled the back of the silver jacket , seeping out through a tear above the heart area . Quillan bent down , got his hands under Fluel 's armpits , hauled the body upright.  |p59Reetal  asked , startled , " What are you going to do with him ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shock the Duke ! Zip through the Star 's ComWeb directory , doll , and get me the call symbol for Level Four of the 1 executive Block . " Solvey Kinmarten dimmed the lights in the bedloom , went back to Brock , rearranged the pillows under his head , and bent to place her lips tenderly to the large bruises on his forehead and the side of his jaw . ' I hen she brought a chair up beside the bed , and sat down to watch him . Perhaps a minute later , there was a slight noise behind her . Startled , she glanced around , saw something huge , black and shapeless moving swiftly across the Carpet of the room toward her . Solvey quietly fainted . " Sure you know what to say ? " Quillan asked . Rectal moistened her lips . " Let me go over it in my mind once more . " She was sitting on the floor to the right of the ComWeb stand , face pale and intent . " You know , this makes me feel a little queasy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? " " They 'll fall for it ! " Quillan was on his knees before the stand , supporting Fluel 's body , which sprawled hall across it , directly before the lit vision screen . An uutllung arm hid the Duke 's face from the screen . " You almost had me thinking I was listening to Fluel when you did the take-off on him this evening . A dying man run he expected to sound a little odd . " He smiled encouraginglyat her . " Ready now ? " Rectal nodded nervously , cleared her throat . Oil ' Ilan reached across Fluel , tapped out Level Four 's call symbol on the instrument , ducked back belowthe stand . After a moment , there was a click.  |p60Reetal  produced a quavering , agonized groan . Somebody else gasped . " Duke ! " Baldy Perk 's voice shouted . " What 's hap-pened ? " " Baldy Perk ! " Quillan whispered . Reetal stammered hoarsely , " The C-C-Commodore , Baldy ! Shot me . . . shot Marras ! They 're after . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought Bad News  --  " Baldy sounded stunned . " Was w-wrong , Baldy , " Reetal croaked . " Bad News . . . with us ! Bad News . . . pal ! The C-C-Comm " Beneath the ComWeb stand , the palm of Quillan 's right hand thrust sharply up and forward . The stand tilted , went crashing back to the floor . Fluel 's body lurched over with it . The vision screen shattered . Baldy 's roaring question was cut off abruptly . " Great stuff , doll ! " Quillan beamed , helping Reetal to her feet . " That was Fluel ! You sent shudders down my back ! " " Down mine , too ! " " I 'll get him out of here . Ditch him in one of the shutoffsections . Then I 'll get back to the Executive Block . If Ryter 's thought to look into Kinmarten 's room , they 'll really be raving on both sides there now ! " " Is that necessary ? " Reetal asked . " For you to go back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of you . " " Ryter might , " Quillan agreed . " He 's looked like the sharpest of the lot from the start . But we 'll have to risk it . We 've got all the makings of a shooting war there , but we 've got to make sure it gets set off before somebody thinks of comparing notes . If I 'm around , I 'll keep jolting their nerves . " " I suppose you 're right . Now , our group Quillan nodded . " No need to hold off on that anyp61longer , the way things are moving . Get on another ComWeb and start putting out those Mayday messages right away . Then , as soon as you 've rounded up theboys " That , " Reetal said , " might take a little less than an hour . " " Dine ! Move them right into the Executive Block . With just a bit of luck , one hour from now should land them in the final stages of a beautiful battle on the upper levels . Give them my description @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Why Ryter 's ? " " Found out he was the boy who took care of the bomb-planting detail . We want him alive . Others might n't know where it 's tucked away . Heraga says the clerical staff and technicians in there all wear the white Star uniforms . Anyone but Ryter and myself who Is n't in uniform is fair game .... " He paused . " Oh , and tip them off about the Hlat ! God knows what that thing will he doing when the ruckus starts . " " What about sending a few men in through the fifth level portal , the one you 've unplugged ? " Quillan considered , shook his head . " No . Down on the ground level is where we want them . They 'd have to portal there again from the fifth , and a portal is too easy to seal off and defend . Now let 's get a blanket or something to tuck Fluel into . I do n't want to feel conspicuous It I run into somebody on the way . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Executive Block a short while later , came to a sudden stop just outside it . In the big room beyond the entry hall , the door of the baited cubicle was closed , and the life indicator on the door showed a bright steady green glow . Quillan stared at it a moment , looking somewhatp62surprised , then went quietly into the room and bent to study the cubicle 's instruments . A grin spread slowly over his face . The trap had been sprung ! He glanced at the deep-rest setting , turned it several notches farther down . " Happy dreams , Lady Pendrake ! " he murmured . " That takes care of you . What an appetite ! And now ... " As the Level Four portal dilated open before him , a gun blazed from across the hall . Quillan flung himself out and down , rolled to the side , briefly aware of a litter of bodies and tumbled furniture farther up the hall . Then he was flat on the carpet , gun out before him , pointing back at the overturned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had come . A hoarse voice bawled , " Bad News  --  hold it ! " Quillan hesitated , darting a glance right and left . Men lying about everywhere , the furnishings a shambles . . . . " That you , Baldy ? " he asked . " Yeah , " Baldy Perk half sobbed . " I 'm hurt " What happened ? " " Star gang jumped us . Portaled in here  --  spitballs and riot guns ! Bad News , we 're clean wiped out ! Everyonethat was on this level Quillan stood up , holstering the gun , went over to the couch and moved it carefully away from the wall . Baldy was crouched behind it , kneeling on the bloodsoakedcarpet , gun in his right hand . He lifted a white face , staring eyes , to Quillan . " Waiting for ' em to come back , " he muttered . " Man , I 'm not for long ! Got hit twice . Near passed out a couple of times already . " " What about your boys on guard downstairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . or they 'd have showed up . They got Cooms and the Duke , too ! Man , it all happenedfast ! " " And the crew on the freighter ? " " Du n no about them . "  | " You know the freighter 's call number ? " " Huh ? Oh , yeah . Sure . Never thought of that , " Ila ldy said wearily . He seemed dazed now. " 1 , et 's see if you can stand . " Ouillan helped the big man to his feet . Baldy had n't bled too much outwardly , but he seemed to have analyzed his own condition correctly . He was n't for long . Quillan slid an arm under his shoulders . " Where 's a ComWeb ? " he asked 13aldy blinked about . " Passage there . . . . " His voice was beginning to thicken . " I he ComWeb was in the second room up the passage . Quillan eased Perk into the seat before it . Baldy 's head lolled heavily forward , like a drunken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quillan asked . Baldy reflected a few seconds , blinking owlishly at the instrument , then told him . Quillan tapped out the number , flicked on the vision screen , then stood aside and back , beyond the screen 's range . " Yeah , Perk ? " a voice said some seconds later . " Hey , Perk  --  Perk , what 's with ya ? " Baldy spat blood , grinned . " Got shot , " he explained . " What ? " " Yeah . " Baldy scowled , blinking . " Now , lessee . . oh , yeah . Star gang 's gon na jump ya ! Watch it ! " " What ? " the other man sounded stupefied . " Yeah , watch  --  " Baldy coughed , laid his big head slowly down face forward on the ComWeb stand , and stopped moving . " Perk ! Man , wake up ! Perk ! " Quillan quietly took out his gun , reached behind the stand and blew the ComWeb apart . He was n't certain what the freighter 's crew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they could hardly regard it as reassuring . He made a brief prowl then through the main sections of the level . Evidence everywhere ofp64a short and furious struggle , a struggle between men panicked and enraged almost beyond any regard for self-preservation . It must have been over in minutes . He found that the big hall portal to the ground level had been sealed , whether before or after the shooting he could n't know . There would have been around twenty members of the Brotherhood on the level . None of them had lived as long as Baldy Perk , but they seemed to have accounted for approximately an equal number of the Star 's security force first . Five Star men came piling out of the fifth level portal behind Quillan a few minutes later , Ryter in the lead , Orca behind Ryter . All five held leveled guns . " You wo n't need the hardware , " Quillan assured them . " It 's harmless enough now . Come on in . " They followed him silently to the cubicle , stared comprehendingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside , all right ! " Ryter said . He looked at Quillan . " Is this where you 've been all the time ? " " Sure . Where else ? " The others were forming a halfcircleabout him , a few paces back . " Taking quite a chance with that Hlat , were n't you ? " Ryter remarked drily . " Not too much . I thought of something . " Quillan indicated the outportal in the hall . " I had my back against that . A portal 's a space-break , not solid matter . It could n't come at me from behind . And if it came from any other angle "  --  he tapped the holstered Miam Devil lightly , and the gun in Orca 's hand jerked upward a fraction of an inch  --  " there are n't many animals that can swallow a full jolt from that baby and keep coming ! " There was a moment 's silence . Then Orca said thoughtfully , " That would work ! " " Did it see you ? " Ryter asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came shooting out from that corner over there . It slammed in after the chunk ofp65sea beef so fast , it shook the cubicle . And that was that . " Quillan grinned . " Well , most of our troubles should be over now ! " One of the men gave a brief , nervous laugh . Quillan looked at him curiously . " Something , chum ? " Ryter shook his head . " Something is right ! Come on downstairs , Bad News . This time we have news for you ... . " The Brotherhood guards on the ground level had been taken by surprise and wiped out almost without losses for the Star men . But the battle on the fourth level had cost more than the dead left up there . An : ulditional number had returned with injuries serious enough to make them useless for further work . " It 's been expensive , " Ryter admitted . " But one more attack by the Hlat would have left me with a panicked mob on my hands . If we 'd realized it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all sure that would work , either , " Quillan said . " Did you get Kinmarten back ? " " Not yet . The chances are he 's locked up somewhere on the fourth level . Now the Hlat 's out of the way , some of the men have gone back up there to look for him . If Cooms thought he was important enough to start a light over , I want him back . " " How about the crew on the Beldon ship ? " Quillan asked . " Have they been cleaned up ? " " No . We 'll have to do that now . " " How many of them ? " " Supposedly twelve . " " If they know or suspect what 's happened , " said Quillan , " twelve men can give a boarding party in a lock a remarkable amount of trouble . " Ryter shrugged irritably . " I know , but there is n't much choice . Lancion 's bringing in the other group on the Camelot . We do n't want to have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How do you plan to take the freighter ? " " When the search party comes back down , we 'll put every man we can spare from guard duty here on the job . They 'll be instructed to be cautious about it  --  if they wind the matter up within the next several hours , that will be early enough . We ca n't afford many additionallosses . But we should come out with enough men to take care of Lancion and handle the shipment of Hlats . That 's what counts . " " Like me to take charge of the boarding party ? " Quillan inquired . " That kind of thing 's been a sort of specialty of mine . " Ryter looked at him without much expression on his face . " So I heard , " he said . " But perhaps it would be better if you stayed here with us . " The men sent to look for Kinmarten returned ten minutes later . They 'd searched every part of the fourth level , and the rest warden was n't there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group had discovered that the Duke of Fluel also was not among those present , and that one of four outportals on the level had been unsealed . The exit on which the portal was found to be set was in a currently unused hall on the far side of the Star . From that point almost every other section of the Star was in portal range . Presumably there was a connection between those facts and Kinmarten 's absence . None of the forty-odd people working in the main control office on the ground level had actually witnessed any shooting ; but it was apparent that a number of them were uncomfortably aware that something quite extraordinary was going on . However , they were a disciplined group . An occasional uneasy glance toward one of the armed men lounging along the walls , a few anxious faces , were the only indications of tension . Now and then , there was a brief , low-pitched conversationat one of the desks.  |p67Quillan  stood near the center of the office , Ryter and Orca a dozen feet from him on either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls . horn the office , one could see through a large doorspacecut through both sides of a hall directly into the adjoining transmitter room . Four more guards were over there . Aside from the men in the entrance hall and at the subspace portal , what was available at the moment of Ryter 's security force was concentrated at these points . The arrangement made sense ; and Quillan gave no sign of being aware that the eyes of the guards were frequently on him , and that none of them moved his hand very far from his gun . That also made sense . In the general tension area here , a specific point of tension-highly charged though undetected by the noninvolvedpersonnel  --  was the one provided by the presence of Bad News Quillan . Ryter was more than suspicious by now ; the opened portal on the fourth level , the disappearance of Kinmarten and Fluel , left room for a variety of speculations , few of which could he favorable to Quillan . Ryter obviously preferred to let things rest until the Beldon freighter was taken and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ section . At that time , Quillan could expect to come in for some very direct questioning . The minutes dragged on . Under the circumstances , a glance at his watch could be enough to bring Ryter 's uncertainties up to the explosion point , and Quillan also preferred to let things stand as they were just now . But he felt certain that well over an hour had passed since he 'd left Reetal ; and so far there had been no suggestion of anything unusual occurring in the front part of the building . The murmur of voices in the control office continued to eddy about . In the transmitter room across the hall , messages had begun to be exchanged between the Star and the approaching Camelot.  |p68A  man sitting at a desk near Quillan stood up , went out into the hall and disappeared . A short while later , the white-suited figure returned and resumed work . Quillan 's glance went over the clerk , shifted on . He felt something tighten up swiftly inside him . There was a considerable over-all resemblance , but that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another minute or two went by . Then two other uniformedfigures appeared at the opening to the hall , a sparse elderly man , a blonde girl . They stood there talkingearnestly together for some seconds , then came slowly down the main aisle toward Quillan . It appeared to be a dispute about some detail of her work . The girl frowned , stubbornly shaking her head . Near Quillan , they separated , turned into different sections of the office . The girl , glancing back , still frowning , brushed against Ryter . She looked up at him , startled . " Oh , I 'm sorry ! " she said . Ryter scowled irritably , started to reply , suddenly looked surprised . Then his eyes went blank and his knees buckled under him . The clerk sitting at the nearby desk whistled shrilly . Quillan wheeled , gun out and up , toward the wall behind him . The two guards there were still lifting their guns . The Miam Devil grunted disapprovingly twice , and the guards went down . Noise crashed from the hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , saw the two other guards tumbling backward along the far wall . Feminine screaming erupted around the office as the staff dove out of sight behind desks , instrument stands , filing cabinets . The elderly man stood above Orca , a sap in his hand and a pleased smile on his face . In the hallway , four white-uniformed men had swung about and were pointing blazing rifles into the transmitter room . The racketing of the gunfire ended abruptly and the rifles were lowered . The human dinp69in the office began to diminish , turned suddenly into a shocked , strained silence . Quillan discovered the blond girl standing by his elbow . " Did you get the rest of them ? " he asked quickly . " Everyone who was on this level , " Reetal told him . " We did n't find many . " " I know . But there 's a sizable batch still in the subspacesection . If we can get the bomb disarmed , we 'll leave them sealed up there for now . How long before you can bring Ryter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in five minutes . " Quillan had been sitting for some little while in a very comfortable chair in what had been the Commodore 's suite on the Seventh Star , broodingly regarding the image of the Camelot in a huge wall screen . The liner was still over two hours ' flight away but would arrive on schedule . On the Star , at least in the normspace section , everything was quiet ; and in the main control offices and in the transmitter room normal working conditions had been restored . A room portal twenty feet away opened suddenly , and Reetal Destone stepped out . " So there you are ! " she observed . Quillan looked mildly surprised , then grinned . " I 'd hate to have to try to hide from you ! " he said . " Hm-mm ! " said Reetal . She smiled . " What are you drinking ? " He nodded at an open liquor cabinet near the screen . " Velladon was leaving some excellent stuff behind . Join me ? " " Mm-hm ! " She went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " One has the impression , " she remarked , " that you were hiding from me . " " One does ? I 'd have to be out of my cotton-picking mind . "  | " Not necessarily . " Reetal brought the drink over to his chair , sat down on the armrest with it . " You might just have a rather embarrassing problem to get worked out before you give little Reetal a chance to start asking questions . " Quillan looked surprised . " What gave you that notion ? " " Oh , " Reetal said , " adding things up gave me that notion . Care to hear what the things were ? " " Go ahead , doll . " " First , " said Reetal , " I understand that a while ago , after sending me off to do some little job for you , you were in the transmitter room having a highly private  --  shielded and scrambled  --  conversation with somebodyon board the Camelot . " " Why , yes , " Quillan said . " I was talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have a Federation police boat pick up what 's left of the Commodore 's boys and the Brotherhood in the subspace section . " " And that , " said Reetal , " is where the embarrassing little problem begins . . . . Next , I noticed , as I say , that you were showing this tendency to avoid a chance for a private talk between us . After thinking about that a little , and also about a few other things which came to mind at around that time , I went to see Ryter . " " Now why Reetal ran her fingers soothingly through his hair . " Let me finish , big boy . . . . I found Ryter and Orca in a highly nervous condition . And do you know why they 're nervous ? They 're convinced that some time before the Camelot gets here , you 're going to do them both in . " " Hm-mm , " said Quillan . " Ryter , " she went on , " besides being nervous , is also very bitter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plain what you 've done here . You and your associates  --  a couple of tough boys named Hagready and Boltan , and othersp71not identified  --  are also after these Hlats . The Duke made some mention of that , too , you remember . The Commodore and Ryter bought the story you told them because a transmitter check produced the information that Hagready and Boltan had , in fact , left their usual work areas and gone off on secret business about a month ago . " Ryter feels that your proposition  --  to let your gang in on the deal for twenty percent , or else  --  was made in something less than good faith . He 's concluded that when you learned of the operation being planned by Velladon and the Brotherhood , you and your pals decided to obstruct them and take the Hlats for delivery to Yaco yourselves , without cutting anybody in . He figures that someone like Hagready or Boltan is coming in on the Camelot with a flock of sturdy henchmen to do just that . You , personally , rushed to the Seventh Star @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admits reluctantly that you did an extremely good job of interfering . He says it 's now obvious that every move you made since you showed up had the one purpose of settingthe Star group and the Brotherhood at each other 's throats . And now that they 've practically wiped each other out , you and your associates can go on happily with your original plans . " But , of course , you ca n't do that if Ryter and Orca are picked up alive by the Federation cops . The boys down in the subspace section do n't matter ; they 're gunhandsand all they know is that you were somebody who showed up on the scene . But Ryter could , and certainly would , talk .... " " Ah , he 's too imaginative ! " Quillan said , taking a swallow of his drink . " I never heard of the Hlats before l got here . As I told you , I 'm on an entirely different kind of job at the moment . I had to make up some kind of story to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "  | " So you 're not going to knock off those two weasels ? " " No such intentions . I do n't mind them sweating about it till the Feds arrive , but that 's it . " " What about Boltan and Hagready ? " " What about them ? I did happen to know that if anyonestarted asking questions about those two , he 'd learn that neither had been near his regular beat for close to a month . " " I 'll bet ! " Reetal said cryptically . " What do you mean ? " She smiled . " Bad News Quillan ! A really tough boy , for sure . You know , I did n't believe for an instant that you were after the Hlats . " " Why not ? " " I 've been on a couple of operations with you , and you 'd be surprised how much I 've picked up about you from time to time on the side . Swiping a shipment of odd animals and selling them to Yaco , that could be Bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human beings  --  like Brock and Solvey Kinmartentogo along with the animals to an outfit like Yaco would not be in character . " " So I have a heart of gold , " Quillan said . " So you fell all over your own big feet about half a minute ago ! " Reetal told him . " Bad News Quillanwithno interest whatsoever in the Hlats  --  still could n't afford to let Ryter live to talk to the Feds about him , big boy ! " Quillan looked reflective a moment . " Dirty trick ! " he observed . " For that , you might freshen up my glass . " Reetal took both glasses to the liquor cabinet , freshenedthem , and settled down on the armrest of the chair again . " So there we 're back to the embarrassing little problem , " she said . " Ryter ? " " No , idiot . We both know Ryter is headed for Re/habilitation  --  fifteen years or so of it , at a guess . The problem is little Reetal , who has now learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn . Does she head for Rehabilitation , too ? " Quillan took a swallow of his drink and put the glass down . " Are you suggesting , " he inquired , " that I might be , excuse the expression , a cop ? " Reetal patted his head . " Bad News Quillan ! Let 's look at his record . What do we find ? A shambles , mainly . Smashed-up organizations , outfits , gangs . Top-level crooks sitting around with suddenly vacant expressions and unexplained holes in their heads . Why go on ? The name is awfully well earned ! And nobody realizing anythingbecause the ones who do realize it suddenly  --  well , where are Boltan and Hagready at present ? " Quillan sighed . " Since you keep bringing it up  --  Ilagready played it smart , so he 's in Rehabilitation . Be cute if Ryter ran into him there some day . Pappy Iloltan did n't want to play it smart . I 'm not enough of a philosopher to make a guess at where he might be at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " All right , " Reetal said , " we 've got that straight . Bad News is Intelligence of some sort . Federation , maybe , or maybe one of the services . It does n't matter , really , I suppose . Now , what about me ? " He tapped his glass . " That about you , doll ! You filled it . I 'm drinking it . I may not think quite as fast as you do , but I still think . Would I take a drink from a somewhat lawless and very clever lady who really believed I had her lined up for Rehabilitation ? Or who 'd be at all likely to blab out something that would ruin an old pal 's reputation ? " Reetal ran her fingers through his hair again . " I noticed the deal with the drink , " she said . " I guess I wanted to hear you say it . You do n't tell on me , I do n't tell on you . Is that it ? " " That 's it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wantp74to tell the Feds does n't matter . It stops there ; the Feds will get the word on me before they arrive . By the way , did you let out the Kinmartens yet ? " " Not yet , " Reetal said . " Too busy getting the office help soothed down and back to work . " " Well , let 's finish these drinks and go do it then . The little doll 's almost bound to be asleep by now , but she might still be sitting there , biting nervously at her pretty knuckles . " Major Heslet Quillan , of Space Scout Intelligence , was looking unhappy . " We 're still searching for them everywhere , " he explained to Klayung , " but it 's a virtual certainty that the Hlat got them shortly before it was trapped . " Klayung , a stringy , white-haired old gentleman , was an operator of the Psychology Service , in charge of the shipment of Hlats the Camelot had brought in . He and Quillan were waiting in the vestibule of the Seventh Star @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be brought over from the Executive Block . Klayung said reflectively , " Could n't the criminals with whom you were dealing here have hidden the couple away somewhere ? " Quillan shook his head . " There 's no way they could have located them so quickly . I made half a dozen portal switches when I was taking Kinmarten to the suite . It would take something with a Hlat 's abilities to follow me over that route without being seen . And it must be an unusually cunning animal to decide to stay in hiding until I 'd led it where it wanted to go . " " Oh , they 're intelligent enough , " Klayung agreedabsently . " Their average intelligence is probablyhigher than that of human beings . A somewhat differenttype of mentality , of course . . . . Well , when thecubicle arrives , I 'll question the Hlat and we 'll find out . " Quillan looked at him . " Those control devices makep75it possible to hold two-way conversations with the things ? " " Not exactly , " Klayung said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerned with the Hlat projectrealized it would be almost impossible to keep some information about them from getting out . The specimenwhich was here on the Seventh Star has been stationed at various scientific institutions for the past year . A rather large number of people were involved in investigating it and experimenting with it . In consequence , several little legends about Hlats have been deliberately built up . The legends are n't entirely truthful . Their purpose is to keep the actual facts satisfactorilyvague . " The Hlat-talker is such a legend . Actually , the devicedoes nothing . The Hlats respond to telepathic stimuli , both among themselves and from other beings . they learn rather quickly to correlate such stimuli with the meanings of human speech . " " Then you " Quillan began . " Yes . Eltak , their discoverer , was a fairly good natural telepath . If he had n't been abysmally lazy , he might have become very good at it . I carry a variety of the service 's psionic knickknacks about with me , which gets me somewhat comparable results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widely . Lady Pendrake 's cubicle floated through , directed by two gravity crane operators . Klayung stood up . " Set it there for the present , please , " he told the operators . " We may call for you later if it needs to be moved again . " He waited until the portal had closed behind the men before walking over to the cubicle . He examined the settings and readings at some length . " Urn , yes , " he said , straightening finally . His expressionbecame absent . After a few seconds , he went on . " I 'm beginning to grasp the situation , I believe . Let mep76tell you a few things about the Hlats , Major . For one , they form quite pronounced likes and dislikes . Eltak , for example , would have been described by most of his fellow men as an offensive person . But the Hlats actually became rather fond of him during the fifteen or so years he lived on their island . " That 's one point . The other has to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way out here that our charges had gained quite as comprehensive an understanding of the functioning of the cubicles constructedfor them as any human who was not a technical specialist might do . And  --  " He interrupted himself , stood rubbing his chin for a moment . " Actually , " he said , " that should be enough to prepareyou for a look inside the Hlat 's cubicle . " Quillan gave him a surprised glance . " I know it 's hideous , " he remarked . " But I 've seen revolting lookingmonsters before this . " Klayung coughed . " That 's not exactly what I meant , " he said . " I . . . well , let 's just open the thing up . Would you mind , Major ? " " Not at all . " Quillan stepped over to the side of the cubicle , unlocked the door switch and pulled it up . They both moved back a few feet before the front of the cubicle . A soft humming came for some seconds from the door 's mechanisms ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside , straightened instantly again , hair bristling . " Where is it ? " he demanded , the Miam Devil out in his hand . Klayung looked at him thoughtfully . " Not very far away , I believe . But I can assure you , Major , that it has n't the slightest intention of attacking us  --  or anybodyelse  --  at present . " Quillan grunted , looked back into the cubicle . Atp77the far end , the Kinmartens lay side by side , their faces composed . They appeared to be breathing regularly . " Yes , " Klayung said , " they 're alive and unharmed . " I le rubbed his chin again . " And I think it would be best if we simply closed the cubicle now . Later we can call physicians over from the hospital to put them under sedation before they 're taken out . They 've both had thoroughly unnerving experiences , and it would be advisable to awaken them gradually to avoid emotional shock . " 1 le moved over to the side of the cubicle , turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of it , " he said . " We may as well sit down , Major . This may take a little time ... . " Let 's look at the thing for a moment from the viewpointof the Hlat , " he resumed when he was once more comfortably seated . " Eltak 's death took it by surprise . It had n't at that point grasped what the situation in the I executive Block was like . It took itself out of sight for the moment , killing one of the gang leaders in the process , then began prowling about the various levels of the building , picking up information from the minds and conversation of the men it was observing . In a fairly short time , it learned enough to understand what was planned by the criminals ; and it arrived at precisely your own conclusion  --  that it might be possible to reduceand demoralize the gangs to the extent that they would no longer be able to carry out their plans . It began a systematic series of attacks on them with that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the picture . The that was puzzled by your motives at first because there Appeared to be an extraordinary degree of discrepancy between what you were saying and what you were thinking . But after observing your activities for a while ,  |p78it  began to comprehend what you were trying to do . It realized that your approach was more likely to succeed than its own , and that further action on its side might interfere with your plans . But there remained one thing for it to do . " I may tell you in confidence , Major , that another legend which has been spread about these Hlats is their supposed inability to escape from the cubicles . Even their attendants are supplied with this particular bit of misinformation . Actually , the various force fields in the cubicles do n't hamper them in the least . The cubiclesare designed simply to provide safe and comfortablequarters for the Hlats and to keep them from being seen . Rest cubicles , of course , can be taken anywhere without arousing undue curiosity . " You mentioned that the Kinmartens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling about them . There was no assurance at this point that the maneuvers to keep a bomb from being exploded on the Star would succeed ; and the one place where human beings could hope to survive such an explosion was precisely the interior of the Hlat 's cubicle , which had been constructed to safeguard its occupant against any kind of foreseeable accident . " So the Hlat removed the bait from your cubicle trap , and concealed the Kinmartens inside . It concludedcorrectly that everyone would decide it had been recaptured and refrain from opening the cubicle to keep it from escaping again . After that , it moved about the Executive Block , observing what was happening and prepared to take action again if that seemed advisable . After you had accomplished your goal , it remained near the cubicle , waiting for me to arrive . " Quillan shook his head . " That 's quite a creature ! " he remarked after some seconds . " You say it 's in our generalvicinity now ? "  | " Yes , " Klayung said . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the walls of the vestibulewhile we . . . well , while I talked . " " Why does n't it show itself ? " Klayung cleared his throat . " For two reasons . One is that rather large gun you 're holding on your knees . It saw you use it several times , and after all the shooting r n the Executive Block , you see .... " Quillan slid the Miam Devil into his holster . " Sorry , " he said . " Force of habit , I guess . Actually , of course , I 've understood for some minutes now that I was n't .. . well , what 's the other reason ? " " I 'm afraid , " Klayung said , " that you offended it with your remark about its appearance . Hlats may have their share of vanity . At any rate , it seems to be sulking . " " Oh , " said Quillan . " Well , I 'm sure , " he went on rather loudly , that it understands I received the descriptionfrom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was highly inaccurate . " " Hmm ! " said Klayung . " That seems to have done it , Major . The wall directly across from us . . . . " Something like a ripple passed along the side wall of the vestibule . Then the wall darkened suddenly , turned black . Quillan blinked , and the Hlat was in view . It hung , spread out like a spider , along half the length of the vestibule wall . Something like a huge , hairy amoeba in over-all appearance , though the physical structures under that coarse black pelt must be of very unamoebalikecomplexity . No eyes were in sight , but Quillan had the impression of being regarded steadily . Here and there , along the edges and over the surface of the body , were a variety of flexible extensions . Quillan stood up , hitched his gun belt into position , and started toward the wall . " Lady Pendrake , " he said , " honored to meet you ! ( ' ould we shake hands ? "  |p80THE  SEARCHERT WAS NIGHT in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sky was obscured by the dense cosmic cloud called the Pit , little more than two light-years away . Overhead , only a scattering of nearby stars twinkled against the sullen gloom of the cloud . Far to the east , its curving edges were limned in brilliance , for beyond it , still just below the horizon , blazed the central sun clusters of the Hub . The landscaped private spaceport was well lit but almost deserted . A number of small ships stood about in their individual stations , and two watchmen on a pair of float scooters were making a tour of the grounds , moving along unhurriedly twenty feet up in the air . They were n't too concerned about intruders  --  the ships were locked and there was little else of value around to steal . But their duties included inspecting the area every two hours , and they were doing it . One of them checked his scooter suddenly , said through his mike , " Take a look at Twenty-two , will you ! " His companion turned his head in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largest one here at present , an interstellar yacht which had berthed late in the afternoon , following an extensive pleasure cruise . He stared in surprise , asked , " Nobody on board , is there ? " I'he first watchman was checking his list . " Not supposedto be until tomorrow . She 's getting a standard overhaul then . What do you suppose that stuff is ? " The stuff he referred to looked like a stream of pale , purple fire welling silently out of the solid hull of the v eht , about halfway up its side . It flowed down along t he side of the ship , vanishing as it touched the ground -- appeared actually to be pouring on unchecked through the base of Station Twenty-two into the earth . Both men had glanced automatically at the radiation indicatorson the scooters and found them reassuringly inactive . But it was a puzzling , eerie sight : " It 's new to me ! " the other man said uneasily . " Better report it right away ! There might be somebody on hoard , maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment . It 's stopping ! " They looked on in silence as the last of the fiery flow slid down the yacht , disappeared soundlessly into the station 's foundation . The first watchman shook his head . " I 'll call the super , " he said . " He 'll A sharp whistling rose simultaneously from the two radiation indicators . Pale fire surged out of the ground beneath the scooters , curved over them , enclosing the men and their vehicles . For a moment , the figures of the watchmen moved convulsively in a shifting purple plow ; then they appeared to melt , and vanished . The tire sank back to the ground , flowed down into it . The piercing clamor of the radiation indicators faded quickly to a whisper and ended . The scooters hung in the air , motionless , apparently undamaged . But the watchmen were gone.  |p82Eighty  yards underground , the goyal lay quiet while the section it had detached to assimilate the two humans who had observed it as it left the ship returned and again became a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of units , an entity now energy , now matter , vastly extensibleand mobile in space , comparatively limited in the heavy mediums of a planet . At the moment , it was close to its densest material form , a sheet of unseen luminescencein the ground , sensor groups probing the spaceportarea to make sure there had been no other witnesses to its arrival on Mezmiali . There appeared to have been none . The goyal began to drift underground toward a point on the surface of the planet about a thousand miles away from the spaceport ... . And , about a thousand miles away , in the direction the goyal was heading , Danestar Gems raked darkgreenfingernails through her matching dark-green hair , and swore nervously at the little spy-screen she 'd been manipulating . Danestar was alone at the moment , in a small room of the University League 's Unclassified Specimens Depot on Mezmiali . The Depot was composed of a group of large , heavily structured , rather ugly buildings , covering about the area of an average village , which stood in the countryside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over three centuries old and enclosed as a unit by a permanent energy barrier , presenting to the world outside the appearance of a somewhat flattened black dome which completely concealed the structures . Originally , there had been a fortress on this site , constructedduring a period when Mezmiali was subject to periodic attacks by space raiders , human and alien . The ponderous armament of the fortress , designed to deal with such enemies , had long since been dismantled ;  |p83hut  the basic buildings remained , and the old energy harrier was the one still in use  --  a thing of monstrous power , retained only because it had been simpler and less expensive to leave it in place than to remove it . Nowadays , the complex was essentially a warehousearea with automatic maintenance facilities , an untidy giant museum of current and extinct galactic life and its artifacts . It stored mineral , soil , and atmospheresamples , almost anything , in fact , that scientificx peditions , government exploration groups , prospectors , colonial workers , or adventuring private parties were likely to pick up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University League as being perhaps of sufficient interest to warrant detailed analysisof its nature and properties . For over a century , the league had struggled  --  and never quite managed  --  to k cep up with the material provided it for study in this manner . Meanwhile , the specimens continued to come in and were routed into special depots for preliminary cataloguing and storage . Most of them would turn out to be without interest , or of interest only to the followersof some esoteric branch of science . A relatively very small number of items , however , eventually might becomevery valuable , indeed , either because of the new scientific information they would provide or because they could be commercially exploited , or both . Such items had a correspondingly high immediate sales value as soon as their potential qualities were recognized . Hence the Unclassified Specimens Depots were , in one way or another , well protected areas ; none of them more impressively so than the Mezmiali Depot . The lowering black barrier enclosing it also served to reassurethe citizenry of the planet when rumors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Life Bank vaults contained dormant alien monstrosities such as human eyes rarely looked upon . But mainly the barrier was there because the Uni/versity League did not want some perhaps priceless specimens to be stolen . That was also why Danestar Gems was there . Danestar was a long-waisted , lithe , beautiful girl , dressed severely in a fitted black coverall suit and loose short white jacket , the latter containing numerous concealedpockets for the tools and snooping devices with which she worked . The wide ornamental belt enclosing the suit under the jacket similarly carried almost indetectablebatteries of tiny control switches . Her apparentlyfrivolous penchant for monocolor make-updark-greenat the moment : green hair and lashes , green eyes , lips , nails , all precisely the same shade  --  was part of the same professional pattern . The hair was a wig , like a large flowing helmet , designed for Danestar personally , with exquisite artistry , by a stylist of interstellarfame ; but beneath its waves was a mass of miniature gadgetry , installed with no less artistry by Danestar herself . On another day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursuing , the wig and other items might be sea-blue , scarlet , or a somewhatappalling pale-pink . Her own hair was dark brown , cut short . In most respects , Danestar actually was a rather conservative girl . For the past ten minutes , she had been trying unsuccessfullyto contact her colleague , Corvin Wergard . Wergard 's last report , terminated abruptly , had reached her from another section of the Depot . He 'd warned her that a number of armed men were trying to close in on him there and that it would be necessary for him to take prompt evasive action . Danestar Gems and Corvin Wergard were employeesof the Kyth Interstellar Detective Agency , working in the Depot on a secret assignment for UniversityLeague authorities . Officially , they had beenp85sent here two weeks before as communications technicianswho were to modernize the Depot 's antiquated systems . Danestar was , as a matter of fact , a communicationsexpert , holding an advanced degree in the subject . Corvin Wergard had a fair working knowledge lit communication systems ; but they were not his specialty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keeping , him out of a place he wanted to get into or look into was a remarkably difficult thing to do . ' Their working methods differed considerably . Danestar was an instrument girl . The instruments she favored were cobwebby miniatures ; disassembled , all fitted comfortably into a single flat valise which went wherever Danestar did . Most of them she had built herself , painstakingly and with loving care like a fly fishermancreating the gossamer tools of his hobby . Next to them , their finest - commercial equivalents looked crude and heavy  --  not too surprisingly , since Danestar'sinstruments were designed to be handled only by her own slender , extremely deft fingers . On an operation , she went about , putting out ten , twenty , fifty or a hundred eyes and ears , along with such other sensors , telltales , and recorders of utterly inhuman type as were required by the circumstances , cutting in on establishedcommunication lines and setting up her own , masked by anti-antispying devices . In many cases , of course , her touch had to be imperceptible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confirmed snoop , liked her work , and was very good at it . Wergard 's use of tools , on the other hand , was restrictedto half a dozen general-utility items , not particularly superior to what might be expected of the equipment of any enterprising and experienced bur-r i a r . He simply knew locks and the methods used to protect them against tampering or to turn them into deadly traps inside and out ; and , by what might havep86been in part an intuitive process of which he was unaware , he knew what to do about them , whether they were of a type with which he was familiar or not , almost in the instant he encountered them . To observers , he sometimes appeared to pass through the ordinary run of locked doors without pausing . Concealed alarms and the like might delay him a minute or two ; but he rarely ran into any contrivance of the sort that could stop him completely . The two had been on a number of previous assignmentstogether and made a good team . Between them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ network of Danestar'sespionage devices within twenty-four hours after their arrival . At that point , a number of complications made themselvesevident . Their principal target here was the director of the Depot , Dr. Hishkan . The University League had reason to believe  --  though it lacked proof  --  that severalitems which should have been in the Depot at present were no longer there . It was possible that the fault lay with the automatic storage , recording , and shipping equipment ; in other words , that the apparently missing items were simply not in their proper place and would eventually be found . The probability , however , was that they had been clandestinely removed from the Depot and disposed of for profit . In spite of the Depot 's size , only twenty-eight permanentemployees worked there , all of whom were housedin the Depot itself . If any stealing was going on , a number of these people must be involved in it . Among them , Dr. Hishkan alone appeared capable of selecting out of the vast hodgepodge of specimens those which would have a genuine value to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was definitely pointed at him.  |p87That  made it a difficult and delicate situation . Dr. Hishkan had a considerable reputation as a man of science and friends in high positions within the League . Unquestionable proof of his guilt must be provided before accusations could be made ... . Danestar and Corvin Wergard went at the matter unhurriedly , feeling their way . They would have outsideassistance available if needed but had limited means of getting information out of the Depot . Their private transmitter could not drive a message through the energy barrier , hence could be used at most for a short period several times a day when airtrucks or space shuttles passed through the entrance lock . The Depot 's communicators were set up to work through the barrier , but they were in the main control station near the entrance lock and under observation around the clock . Two things became clear almost immediately . The nature of their assignment here was suspected , if not definitely known ; and every U-League employee in the Depot , from Dr. Hishkan on down , was involved in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operation with established outside contacts and with connections in the League to tip them off against investigators . Except for Wergard 's uncanny ability to move unnoticedabout an area with which he had familiarized himself almost as he chose , and Danestar 's detectionproofinstrument system , their usefulness in the Depot would have been over before they got started . But within a few days , they were picking up significant scraps of information . Dr. Hishkan did not intend to let their presence interfere with his activities ; he had something going on too big to postpone until the supposedcommunications technicians gave up here and left . In fact , the investigation was forcing him to rush his plans through , since he might now be relieved of hisp88position as head of the Depot at any time , on general suspicions alone . They continued with the modernization of the communicationssystems , and made respectable progress there . It was a three months ' job , so there was no danger they would get done too quickly with it . During and between work periods , Danestar watched , listened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on guard . Dr. Hishkan left the Depot for several hours three times in two weeks . He was not trailed outside , to avoid the chance of a slip which might sharpen his suspicions . The plan was to let him make his arrangements , then catch him in the act of transferringUniversity League property out of the Depot and into the hands of his contacts . In other respects , he was carrying out his duties as scientific director in irreproachablemanner . They presently identified the specimen which Dr. Hishkan appeared to be intending to sell this time . It seemed an unpromising choice , by its looks a lump of asteroid material which might weigh around half a ton . But Dr. Hishkan evidently saw something in it , for it had been taken out of storage and was being kept in a special vault near his office in the main Depot building . The vault was left unguarded  --  presumably so as not to lead to speculations about its contents  --  but had an impressive series of locks , which Wergard studied reflectivelyone night for several minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forty seconds . He planted a number of Danestar 's observation devices in the vault , locked it up again and went away . The devices , in their various ways , presently took note of the fact that Dr. Hishkan , following his third trip outside the Depot , came into the vault and remainedoccupied for over an hour with the specimen . His activities revealed that the thing was an artifact ,  |p89that  the thick shell of the apparent asteroid chunk could be opened in layers within which nestled a variety of Instruments . Hishkan did something with the instrumentswhich created a brief but monstrous blast of static in Danestar 's listening recorders . As the next supplies truck left the Depot , Danestar hi-anted a shortcode message through the open barrierlocks to their confederates outside , alerting them for possibly impending action and describing the object which would be smuggled out . Next day , she received on acknowledgment by the same route , including a summary of two recent news reports . The static blast ohe had described apparently had been picked up at the same instant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way through the nearest Hub cluster . I here was some speculation about its source , particularly  --  this was the subject of the earlier report  --  because a similar disturbance had been noted approximatelythree weeks before , showing the same mysteriously widespread pattern of simultaneous occurrence . Wergard , meanwhile , had dug out and copied the Depot record of the item 's history . It had been picked tip in the fringes of the cosmic dust cloud of the Pit several years earlier by the only surviving ship of a three-vessel U-League expedition , brought back because it was emitting a very faint , irregular trickle of radiation , and stored in the Unclassified Specimens Depot pending further investigation . The possibility that the radiation might be coming from instruments had not occurred to anybody until Dr. Hishkan took a closer look at the asteroid from the Pit . " Floating in space , " Danestar said thoughtfully . " So it 's a signaling device . An alien signaling device . Probably belonging to whatever 's been knocking off Hub ships in the Pit . "  | " Apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ businesshere , of course , is to nail Hishkan and stop the thieving .... " " Of course , " Danestar said . " But we ca n't take a chance on this thing 's getting lost . The Federation has to have it . It will tell them more about who built it , what they 're like , than they 've ever found out since they began to suspect there 's something actively hostile in the Pit . " Wergard looked at her consideringly . Over two hundredships , most of them Federation naval vessels , had disappeared during the past eighty years in attempts to explore the dense cosmic dust cloud near Mezmiali . Navigational conditions in the Pit were among the worst known . Its subspace was a seething turmoil of energies into which no ship could venture . Progress in normal space was a matter of creeping blindly through a murky medium stretching out for twelve light-years ahead where contact with other ships and with stations beyond the cloud was almost instantly lost . A number of expeditions had worked without mishap in the outer fringes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply did not return . A few fragmentary reports indicated the Pit concealed inimical intelligent forces along with natural hazards . Wergard said , " I remember now . . . you had a brother on one of the last Navy ships lost there , did n't you ? " " I did , " Danestar said . " Eight years ago . I was wild about him  --  I thought I 'd never get over it . The ship sent out a report that its personnel was being wiped out by what might be a radiation weapon . That 's the most definite word they 've ever had about what happens there . And that 's the last they heard of the ship . " " All right , " Wergard said . " That makes it a personal matter . I understand that . And it makes sense to have the thing wind up in the hands of the military scientists . But I do n't want to louse up our operation . "  | " It need n't be loused up , " Danestar said . " You'vegot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if possible . I 'll need around two hours to study the thing . " " Two hours ? " Wergard looked doubtful . " Yes . I want a look at what it 's using for power to cut rough standard static shielding , not to mention the Depot 's force barrier . And I probably should make duplos of at least part of the system . " I'he section patrol goes past there every hour , " Wergard said . " You 'll be running a chance of getting caught . " " Well , you see to it that I do n't , " Danestar told him . Wergard grunted . " All right , " he said . " Can do . " She spent her two hours in Dr. Hishkan 's special vault that night , told Wergard afterwards , " It 's a ternponddistorter , of course . A long-range communicator in the most simple form  --  downright primitive . At a guess , a route marker for ships . A signaling device ... . It picks up impulses , can respond with any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them in those blasts . I do n't think he really knew what he was doing . " " That should be really big stuff commercially , then , " Wergard remarked . " Decidedly ! On the power side , it 's forty percent more efficient than the best transmitters I 've heard about . Nothing primitive there ! Whoever got his hands on the thing should be able to give the ComWeb system the first real competition it 's had .... " She added , " But this is the most interesting part . Wergard , that thing is old ! It 's an antique . At a guess , it has n't been used or serviced within the past five centuries . Obviously , it 's still operational  --  the central sections are so well shielded they have n't been affected much . Other parts have begun to fall apart or have vanished . That 's a little bit sinister , would n't you say ? "  |p92Wergard  looked startled . " Yes , I would . If they had stuff five hundred years ago better in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... " " In some rather important respects , too , " Danestar said . " I did n't get any clues to it , but there 's obviously a principle embodied designed to punch an impulse through all the disturbances of the Pit . If our ships had that . " " All right , " Wergard said . " I see it . But let 's set it up to play Dr. Hishkan into our hands besides . How about this  --  you put out a shortcode description at the first opportunity of what you 've found and what it seems to indicate . Tell the boys to get the information to Federationagents at once . " Danestar nodded . " Adding that we 'll go ahead with our plans as they are , but they 're to stand by outside to make sure the gadget does n't get away if there 's a slip-up ? " " That 's what I had in mind , " Wergard agreed . " The Feds should cooperate  --  we 're handing them the thing on a platter . " He left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transmission . It was fifteen minutes later , just before she 'd finished with it , that Wergard 's voice informed her over their private intercom that the entry lock in the energy barrier had been opened briefly to let in a space shuttle and closed again . " I would n't bet , " he said , " that this one 's bringing in specimens or supplies . . . . " He paused , added suddenly , " Look out for yourself ! There 're boys with guns sneakinginto this section from several sides . I 'll have to move . Looks like the word 's been given to pick us up ! " Danestar heard his instrument snap off . She swore softly , turned on a screen showing the area of the lock . The shuttle stood there , a sizable one . Men were coming out of it . It clearly had n't been bringing in supplies or specimens.  |p93Danestar  stared at it , biting her lip . In another few horn s , they would have been completely prepared for this ! The airtruck which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come and left during that ling ; and as the lock opened for it , her signal to set up the trap for the specimen smugglers would have been receivedby the Kyth Agency men waiting within observationrange of the Depot . Thirty minutes later , any vehicle leaving the Depot without being given a simultaneousshortcode clearance by her would be promptly intercepted and searched . But now , suddenly , they had a problem . Not only were the smugglers here , they had come prepared to take care of the two supposed technicians the U-League had planted in the Depot to spy on Dr. Hishkan . She and Corvin Wergard could make themselves very difficult to find ; but if they could n't be located , the instrumentfrom the Pit would be loaded on the shuttle and the thieves would be gone again with it , probably taking Dr. Hishkan and one or two of his principal U-League confederates along . Danestar 's warning message would go out as they left , but that was cutting it much too line ! A space shuttle of that type was fast and maneuverable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a chance the Kyth operators outside would be able to capture it before it rejoined its mother , hip and vanished from the Mezmiali System  --  but the chance was not at all a good one . No , she decided , Dr. Hishkan 's visitors had to be persuaded to stay around a while , or the entire operationwould go down the drain . Switching on half a dozen ether screens , she set recorders to cover them , went quickly about the room making various preparations to meet the emergency , came back to her worktable , completed the message to their confederates and fed it into a small shortcode transmitter . The transmitter anished into a deep wall recess it shared with a fewp94other essential devices . Danestar settled down to study the screens , in which various matters of interest could now be observed , while she waited with increasing impatience for Wergard to call in again . More minutes passed before he did , and she 'd started checking over areas in the Depot where he might have gone with the spy screen . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them now , " he said . " They got rather close for a while . Nobody 's tried to bother you yet ? " " No , " said Danestar . " But our Depot manager and three men from the shuttle came skulking along the hall a minute or two ago . They 're waiting outside the door . " " Waiting for what ? " " For you to show up . " " They know you 're in the room ? " Wergard asked . " Yes . One of them has a life detector . " " The group that 's looking around for me has another of the gadgets , " Wergard said . " That 's why it took so long to shake them . I 'm in a sneaksuit now . You intend to let them take you ? " - " That 's the indicated move , " Danestar said . " Everything'sset up for it . Let me brief you .... " The eight men who had come off the shuttle belonged to a smuggling ring which would act as middleman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They 'd gone directly to Dr. Hishkan 's office in the Depot 's main building , and Danestar had a view of the office in one of her wall screens when they arrived . The specimen already had been brought out of the vault , and she 'd been following their conversation about it . Volcheme , the chief of the smugglers , and his assistant , Galester , who appeared to have had scientific training , showed the manner of crack professionals . They were efficient businessmen who operated outside the law as a calculated risk because it paid off . Thisp95made dealing with them a less uncertain matter than if they had been men of Dr. Hishkan 's caliber  --  intelligent , amoral , but relatively inexperienced amateurs in crime . Amateurs with a big-money glint in their eyes and guns in their hands were unpredictable , took very careful handling . Volcheme and Galester , on the ether- hand , while not easy to bluff , could be counted on to think and act logically under pressure . Danestar was planning to put on considerable pressure. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . " Hishkan thinks we 're U-League spies but that we have n't f o u n d out anything . Volcheme wants to be certain . I hat 's why he sent in word to have us picked up before he got here . Hishkan is nervous about getting involved in outright murder but will go along with it . " Wergard nodded . " He has n't much choice at this stage . Well , play it straight then  --  or nearly straight . I 'll listen but wo n't show unless there 's a reason . While I 'm at large , you have life insurance . I suppose you 're quizproofed .... " " Right . " Danestar checked her watch . " Doped to the eyebrows . I took it twenty minutes ago , so the stuff . mould be in full effect now . I 'll make the contact at once . " Wergard 's face vanished from the spy screen . Danestarturned the sound volume on the wall screen showmgthe group in Dr. Hishkan 's office back up . Two sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and already had stored away enough evidence to convictDr . Hishkan on a number of counts . One of the sets was a decoy ; it was concealed in the wall , cleverly enough but not so cleverly that the smugglers would n't find it when they searched the room . The duplicate set was extremely well concealed . Danestar had made similar arrangements concerning the handful of otherp96instruments she could n't allow them to discover . Whenthey took stock of the vast array of miniature espionage devices they 'd dig up here , it should seem inconceivable to them that anything else might still be hidden . She sent a final glance around the room . EverythingI was as ready as she could make it . She licked her lips lightly , twisted a tiny knob on her control belt , shifted her fingers a quarter-inch , turned down a switch . Her eyes went back to the view in Dr. Hishkan 's office . Dr. Hishkan , Volcheme , and Galester were alonein it at the moment . Three of Volcheme 's men waitedwith Tornull , the Depot manager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the remaining three had been sent to join the search for Wergard . The craggy lump of the asteroid which was n't an asteroid stood in one corner . Several of its sections had been opened , and Galester was making a careful examination of a number of instrumentshe 'd removed from them . Dr. Hishkan , showing signs of nervousness , evidentlyhad protested that this was an unnecessary delay because Galester was now saying to Volcheme , " Perhapshe does n't understand that when our clients pay for this specimen , they 're buying the exclusive privilege of studying it and making use of what they learn . " " Naturally I understand that ! " Dr. Hishkan snapped . " Then , " Galester went on , " I think we should have an explanation for the fact that copies have been made of several of these subassemblies . " " Copies ? " Dr. Hishkan 's eyes went wide with amazed suspicion . " Ridiculous ! I " You 're certain ? " Volcheme interrupted . " Absolutely , " Galester told him . " There 's measurableduplo radiation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far . There 's no point in denying that , Doctor . We simply want to know why you made the duplicates and what you 've done with them . "  | " Excuse me ! " Danestar said crisply as Dr. Hishkan began to splutter an indignant denial . " I can explain the matter . The duplos are here . " In the office , a brief silence followed her announcement . Eyes switched right and left , then , as if obeying a common impulse , swung suddenly around to the wall racrccn in which Danestar 's image had appeared . Dr. Hishkan gasped , " Why  --  why that 's " Miss Gems , the communications technician , no doubt , " Volcheme said drily . " Of course , it is , " Danestar said . " Volcheme , I 've listened to this discussion . You put yourself in a jam by coining here . But , under the circumstances , we can make a deal . " The smuggler studied her . He was a lean , blond man , no longer young , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , said , " A deal I 'll like ? " " If you like an out . That 's what you 're being offered . " Dr. Hishkan 's eyes had swiveled with growing Incredulity between the screen and Volcheme 's face . Ile said angrily , " What nonsense is this ? Have her picked up and brought here at once ! We must find out what " I suggest , " Volcheme interrupted gently , " you let rune handle the matter . Miss Gems , I assume your primarypurpose here is to obtain evidence against Dr. Hishkan ? " " Yes , " said Danestar . " You and your associate  --  Mr. Wergard  --  are U-I cague detectives ? " She shook her head . " No such luck , Volcheme ! We 're private agency , Iunll-privilege , Federation charter . " " I suspected it . " Volcheme 's lips pulled back from his teeth in a grimace of hostility . " You show the attributesof the breed . Do I know the agency ? " " Kyth Interstellar. "  |p98He  was silent a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Is Mr. Wergard available for negotiations ? " " No . You 'll talk to me . " " That will be satisfactory . You realize , of course , that I do n't propose to buy your deal blind . . .. " " You are n't expected to , " Danestar said . " Then let 's get the preliminaries out of the way . " The smuggler 's face was bleak and watchful . " I have men guarding your room . Unlock the door for them . " " Of course . " Danestar turned toward the door 's lock control in the wall on her left . Volcheme pulled a speaker from his pocket . They understood each other perfectly . One of the last things a man of Volcheme 's sort cared to do was get a major private detective agency on his neck . It was a mistake , frequently a fatal one . As a matter of principle and good business , the agencies did n't get off again . But if he saw a chance to go free with the loot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he 'd take it . Danestarwould remain personally safe so long as Volcheme 's men did n't catch up with Wergard . After that , she 'd be safe only if she kept the smuggler convinced he was in a trap from which there was no escape . Within a few hours he would be in such a trap , but he was n't in it at present . Her arrangements were designed to keep him from discovering that . The door clicked open and four men came quickly and cautiously into the room . Three of them were smugglers ; the fourth was Tornull , the U-League depot manager . The one who 'd entered first stayed at the door , pointing a gun at Danestar . Volcheme 's other two men separated , moved toward her watchfully from right and left . They were competent professionals who had just heard that Danestar was also one . The gun aimed at her from the door was n't there for display . " As a start , Decrain , " Volcheme 's voice said fromp99the screen , " have Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Dancstar unsnapped the belt , making no unnecesxatymotions , and handed it to the big man named IDecrain . They were pulling her teeth , or thought they were , which was sensible from their point of view and made no immediate difference from hers ; the belt could be of no use at present . Decrain drew out a chair , told her to sit down and keep her hands in sight . She complied , and the man with the gun came up and stood right feet to her left . Decrain and his companion began a quick , expert search of her living quarters with detectors . Tornull , Dr. Hishkan 's accomplice in amateur crime , watched them , now and then giving Danestar and her guard a puzzled look which indicated the girl did n't appear very dangerous to him and that he could n't understand why they were taking such elaborate precautionswith her . Within six minutes , Decrain discovered as much as Danestar had wanted them to find of her equipment and records . Whenever the detector beams approached the rest of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until they 'd slid without a quiver past the shielded areas . The collection of gadgetry Decrain laid out on Danestar 's worktable was impressiveand exotic enough to still suspicions , as she had expected . When he announced yet another discovery , Galester observed thoughtfully from the screen , " ' That 's a dangerously powerful anti-interrogation drug you use , Miss Gems ! " " It is , " Danestar acknowledged . " But it 's dependable . I 'm conditioned to it . " " How much have you taken ? " " My limit . A ten-hour dose . . . sixty-five units . " She was telling the truth  --  her developed ability to absorb massive dosages of quizproof without perma/nent ill effects had pulled her out of more than one difficultsituation . But a third of the amount she 'd mentioned was considered potentially lethal . Decrain studied her dubiously a moment as if pondering the degree of her humanity . Decrain appeared to be a stolid type , but the uncovering of successive batteries of spidery instrumentsunlike anything he had encountered in his professionalcareer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Danestar 's set of gimmicked wigs  --  to which the green one she 'd been wearing was now added  --  out of a shrinkcase and watched them unfold on the table , he 'd seemed shaken . " You 'll be brought over here now , Miss Gems , " Volcheme said , his face sour . " We want a relaxed atmospherefor our discussion , so Decrain will search you thoroughly first . As far as possible , he 'll be a gentlemanabout it , of course . " " I 'm sure he will be , " Danestar said agreeably . " Becauseif he is n't , his hide becomes part of the deal . " The muscles along Decrain 's jaw tightened , but he continued packaging the sections of Danestar 's instrumentsGalester wanted to examine without comment . Tornull began to laugh , caught sight of the big man 's expression , and sobered abruptly , looking startled . The semimaterial composite body of the goyal flowed below the solid surface of the world of Mezmiali toward the Unclassified Specimens Depot , swerving from its course occasionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cities . Its myriad units hummed with coordinating communal impulses of direction and purpose . Before this , in all its thousand years of existence , the goyal had known only the planets of the Pit , murkily lit by stars which swam like patches of glowing fog in the dark . Once those worlds had supported the civilization of an inventive race which called itself the Builders.  | " Tie Builders developed spaceships capable of sliding unharmed through the cosmic dust at a speed above that of light , and a location system to guide them infalliblythrough the formless gloom where ordinary communicationmethods were useless . Eventually they reached the edges of the Pit . . . and shrank back . They had assumed the dust cloud stretched on to the end of the universe , were appalled when they realized it was limited , seemed suspended in some awesome , gleaming , impossibly open void . To venture into that terrible alien emptiness themselveswas unthinkable . But the urge to explore it by other means grew strong . The means they presently selected was a lowly form of energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the planets of the Pit . The ingenuity of the Builders produced in it the impulse to combine with its kind into increasingly large , more coherent and more purposeful groups ; and the final result of their manipulations was the goyal , a superbeing which thought and acted as an individual , while its essential structure was still that of a gigantic swarm of the minor uncomplicated prototypes of energy life with which the Builders had begun . The goyal was intended to be their galactic explorer , an intelligent , superbly adaptableservant , capable of existing and sustaining itself as readily in space as on the worlds it encountered . In its way , the goyal was an ultimate achievement of the Builders ' skills . But it was to become also the monument to an irredeemable act of stupidity . They had endowedit with great and varied powers and with keen , specialized intelligence , but not with gratitude . When it discovered it was stronger than its creators and swifter than their ships , it turned on the Builders and made war on them , exterminating them on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a century , it became sole master of the Pit . For a long time , it remained unchallenged there . Itp102shifted about the great dust cloud at will , guided by the Builders ' locator system , feeding on the life of the dim worlds . During that period , it had no concept of intelligenceother than its own and that of the Builders . Then a signal which had not come into use since the last of the Builders vanished alerted the locator system . A ship again had appeared within its range ... . The goyal flashed through the cloud on the locator impulses like a great spider darting along the strands of its web . At the point of disturbance , it found an alien ship groping slowly and blindly through the gloom . Without hesitation , it flowed aboard and swept through the ship , destroying all life inside . It had been given an understanding of instruments , and it studied the ship in detail , then studied the dead beings . They were not Builders though they showed some resemblance to them . Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it had come probing into the Pit from the surrounding void . Other ships presently followed it , singly and in groups . They came cautiously , scanning the smotheringhaze for peril , minds and instruments alert behind a variety of protective devices which seemed adequate until the moment the goyal struck . The enveloping protectivescreens simply were too light to hamper it seriously ; and once it was through the screens , the alien crew was at its mercy . But the persistence these beings showed in intruding on its domain was disturbing to it . It let some of them live for a time on the ships it captured while it watched and studied them , manipulated them , experimented with them . Gradually , it formed a picture of an enemy race in the void which must be destroyedas it . had destroyed the Builders if its supremacy was to be maintained . It did not intend to venture into the void alone . It had planted sections of its body on a number of thep103worlds of the Pit . The sections were as yet immature . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parent body did , possessed barely enough communal mind to know how to nourish themselves from the planetary life about them . But they were growing and developing . In time the goyal would have others of its kind to support it . Until then , it planned to hold the Pit against the blind intruders from the void without letting the enemy race become aware of its existence . Then the unforeseeable happened . An entire section of the locator system suddenly went dead , leaving the remainder functioning erratically . For the first time in its long existence , the goyal was made aware of the extent of its dependence on the work of the Builders . After a long difficult search , it discovered the source of the trouble . A key locator near the edge of the dust cloud had disappeared . Its loss threatened to make the entire system unusable . There was no way of replacing it . The goyal 's mind was not that of a Builder . It had learned readily to use instruments , but it could not construct them . Now it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pit . It should have kept the Builders in subservience to itself so that their skills would always he at its disposal . It could no longer be certain even of detecting the intruding aliens when they came again and preventing them from discovering the secrets of the cloud . Suddenly , the end of its reign seemed near . Unable to develop a solution to the problem , the goyal settled into a kind of apathy , drifted with dimming energies aimlessly about the Pit . . . until , unmistakably , the lost locator called it ! Alert at once , the goyal sped to other units of the system , found they had recorded and pinpointed the distant blast . It had come from beyond the cloud , out of the void ! Raging , the goyal set off in the indicated direction . It had no doubt of what hadp104happened  --  one of the alien ships had discovered the locator and carried it away . But now it could be and would be recovered . Extended into a needle of attenuated energy over a million miles in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its sensor units straining . There was a sun dead ahead ; the stolen instrument must be within that system . The goyal discovered a spaceship of the aliens moving in the same direction , closed with it and drew itself on board . For a time , its presence unsuspected , it remained there , forming its plans . It could use the ship 's energies to build up its reserves , but while the ship continuedtoward Mezmiali , it made no move . Presently it noted a course shift which would take the ship past the Mezmiali system but close enough to it to make the transfer to any of the sun 's four planets an almost effortless step . The goyal remained quiet . Not long afterwards , its sensors recorded a second blast from the lost locator . Now it knew not only to which planet it should go but , within a few hundred miles , at what point of that planet the instrument was to be found . Purple fire lashed out from the ship 's bulkheads to engulf every human being on board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The goyal drank energy from the drive generators to the point of surfeit , left the ship and vanished in the direction of Mezmiali . Within the system , it again closed in on a ship and rode down with it to the planet . It had reached its destination undetected and at the peak of power , its reserves intact . But this was unknown enemy territory , and it remained cautious . For hours , its sensors had known precisely where the locator was to be found . The goyal waited until the humans had disembarked from the ship , until the engines were quiet and it could detect no significant activity in the area immediately about it . Then it flowed out of the shipp105and into the ground . The two humans who saw it emerge were absorbed before they could make a report . There was no reason to hesitate longer . Moving through the dense solid matter of the planet was a tedious process by the goyal 's standards ; but , in fact , only a short time passed before it reached the University League @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very abrupt stop . It had flowed up to the energy barrier surrounding the old fortress site and partly into it . Hostile forces crashed through it instantly with hideous , destructive power . A quarter of its units died in that moment . The remaining units whipped back out of the boiling fury of the field , reassembled painfully underground near the Depot . The body was reduced and its energy depleted , hut it had suffered no lasting damage . The communal mind remained badly shocked for minutes ; then it , too , began to function again . There was not the slightest possibility of breaking through that terrible barrier ! In all its experience , the goyal had never encountered anything similar to it . The defensive ship screens it had driven through in its secretive murders in the Pit had been fragile webs by comparison , and the Builders ' stoutest planetary energy shields had been hardly more effective . It began searching cautiously along the perimeter of the barrier . Presently it discovered the entrance lock . It was closed , but the goyal knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so close that the sensors ' reports on it were blurred , but it was somewhere within this monstrously guarded structure . The goyal decided it needed only to wait . In time , the lock would open and it would enter . It would destroy the humans inside , and be back on its way to the Pit with the locator before the alien world realized that anything was amiss ....  |p106A|p|proximately  an hour later , a slow bulky vehicle came gliding down from the sky toward the Depot . Messages were exchanged between it and a small buildingon the outside of the barrier in the language employed on the ships which had come into the Pit . A section of the communal mind interpreted the exchange without difficulty , reported : The vehicle was bringing supplies , was expected , and would be passed through the barrier lock . At the lock , just below the surface of the ground , the goyal waited , its form compressed to near-solidity , to accompany the vehicle inside . In Dr. Hishkan 's office in the central building of the Depot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a similar degree of interest by the group assembled there . Their feelings about it varied . Danestar'sfeeling  --  in part  --  was vast relief . Volcheme was a very tough character , and there was a streak of gambler 's recklessness in him which might have ruined her plan . " Any time anything big enough to have that apparatus on board leaves the Depot now , we clear it by shortcode before the lock closes , " she 'd said . " You do n't know what message to send . You ca n't get it from me , and you ca n't get it from Wergard . The next truck or shuttle that leaves wo n't get cleared . And it will get stopped almost as soon as it 's outside . " That was it  --  the basic lie ! If they 'd been willing to take the chance , they could have established in five minutes that it was a lie . " You 're bluffing , " Volcheme had said , icily hating her . " The bluff wo n't stop us from leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to run any risks . We 'll simply go out with the shuttle to check your story before we load the thing on . " " Then why do n't you do it ? Why wait ? " She 'd laughed , a little high , a little feverish , with the drugsp107cooking in her  --  her own and the stuff Galester had given her in an attempt to counteract the quizproof effect . She 'd told them it was n't going to work ; and now , almost two hours later , they knew it was n't going to work . They could n't make her feel physical pain , they could n't intimidate her , they could n't touch her mind . They 'd tried all that in the first fifteen minutes when she came into the office , escorted by Decrain and Tornull , and told Volcheme bluntly what the situation was , what he had to do . They could , of course , as they suggested , kill her , maim her , disfigure her . Danestar shrugged it off . I hey could , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would saddle them with . Volcheme was all too awareof it . The threats soon stopped . Volcheme either was in a trap , or he was n't . If the Kyth Agency had him boxed in here , he would have to accept Danestar 's offer , leave with his group and without the specimen . He could see her point  --  they had an airtight case against Dr. Hishkan and his accomplices now . The specimen , whatever its nature , was a very valuable one ; if it had to be recapturedin a running fight with the shuttle , it might be damaged or destroyed . That was the extent of the agency 's responsibility to the U-League . They had no interest in Volcheme . The smuggler was being given an out , as Danestar had indicated . But he 'd had the biggest , most profitable transaction of his career set up , and he was being told he could n't go through with it . He did n't know whether Danestar was lying or not , and he was savage with indecision . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt that part of the story  --  sending the Tuttle out to check around and come back could arouse the suspicions of the observers enough to make them halt it when it emerged the second time . That , in fact , might be precisely what Danestar wanted him to do . He was forced to conclude he could n't take thep108chance . To wait for the scheduled arrival of the supplies truck was the smaller risk . Volcheme did n't like waiting , either . Wergard had n't been found ; and he did n't know what other tricks the Kyth agents could have prepared . But , at any rate , the truck was the answer to part of his problem . It would be let in , unloaded routinely , allowed to depart , its men unaware that anything out of the ordinary was going on in the Depot . They would watch then to see if the truck was stopped outside and searched . If that happened , Volcheme would be obliged to agree to Danestar 's proposal . If it did n't happen , he would know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not be the end of his difficulties . Until Wergard was captured or killed , he still could n't leave with the specimen . The Kyth agents knew enough about him to make the success of the enterprise depend on whether he could silence both of them permanently . If it was possible , he would do it . With stakes as high as they were , Volcheme was not inclined to be squeamish . But that would put an interstellar organization of experienced man-hunters on an unrelenting search for the murderers of two of its members ... . Whatever the outcome , Volcheme was n't going to be happy . What had looked like the haul of a lifetime , sweetly clean and simple , would wind up either in failure or as a dangerously messy partial success . Galester and Decrain , seeing the same prospects , shared their chief 's feelings . And while nobody mentioned that the situation looked even less promising for Dr. Hishkan and Tornull , those two had at least begun to suspect that if the smugglerssucceeded in escaping with the specimen , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the voice of an attendant in the control building near the lock entry finally announced from the wall screen communicator that the supplies truck had arrived and was about to be let into the Depot , Danestar there/f re was the most composed of the group . Even Decrain , who had been detailed to keep his attention on her at all times , stood staring with the others at the screen where Dr. Hishkan was switching on a view of the interior lockDanestar made a mental note of Decrain 's momentary lapse of alertness , though it could make no difference to her at present . The only thing she needed to do , or could do , now was wait . Her gaze shifted to the table where assorted instruments Galester had taken out of the alien signaling device still stood . At the other side of the table was the gadgetry Decrain had brought here from her room , a toy-sized shortcode transmitter among it . Volacmehad wanted to be sure nobody would send out messages while the lock was open . And neither she nor Wergard would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lock switches were thrown , the duplicate transmitter concealed in the wall of her room would start flicking its coded alert out of the Depot , repeating it over and over until the lock closed . And twenty or thirty minutes later , when the supplies truck slid back out through the lock and lifted into the air , it would be challenged and stopped . Then Volcheme would give up , buy his pass to liberty on her terms . There was nothing else he could do . It was n't the kind of stunt she 'd care to repeat too often  --  her nerves were still quivering with unresolved tensions . But she 'd carried it off without letting matters get to a point where Wergard might have had to help her out with some of his fast-action gunplay . Danestar told herself to relax , that nothing at all was likely to go wrong now . Her gaze slipped over to Volcheme and the others , silently watching the wall screen , which was filled with the dead , light-drinking black of the energy barrier , except at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blocked the barrier from view . A great glowing circle , marking the opened lock in the barrier , was centered on the screen . As Danestar looked at it , it was turning a brilliant white . Some seconds passed . Then a big airtruck glided out of the whiteness and settled to the ground . The lock faded behind it , became reabsorbed by the dull black of the barrier . Several men climbed unhurriedly out of the truck , began walking over to the control building . Danestar started upright in her chair , went rigid . A wave of ghostly purple fire had lifted suddenly out of the ground about the truck , about the walking men , enclosing them . There was a general gasp from the watching group in Hishkan 's office . Then , before anyone moved or spoke , a voice roared from the communicator : " Control office , attention ! Radiation attack ! Close internal barrier fields at once ! Close all internal Depot barrier fields at once ! " Volcheme , whatever else might be said of him , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of growing frustration , he was ready to welcome action . Apparently , a radiation weapon of unidentified type had been used inside the Depot . Why it had been turned on the men who had got off the supplies truck was unexplained . But it had consumed them completely in an instant , though the truck itself appeared undamaged . Coming on top of the tensions already seething in the office , the shock of such an attack might have brought on complete confusion . But Volcheme immediately was snapping out very practical orders . The four smugglers detailed to help find Corvin Wergard were working through the Depot 's underground passage system within a few hundred yards of the main building . They joined the group in the office minutes later . The last of Volcheme'smen was stationed in the control section . Hep111confirmed that the defensive force fields enclosing the individual sections of the Depot inside the main barrier had been activated . Something occurred to Volcheme then . " Who gave that order ? " " Wergard did , " said Danestar . They stared at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I did n't realize it , but that was his voice . " Volcheme asked Danestar . " Do you know where heShe shook her head . She did n't know , as a matter of fret . Wergard might have been watching the lock from any one of half a hundred screens in the Depot . He could have been in one of the structures adjacent to the control building . . . too close to that weird fiery phenomenon for comfort . Radiation attack ? What had he really made of it ? Probably , Danestar thought , the same fantastic thing she 'd made of it . His reaction , the general warning shouted into the communications system , implied that , very likely had been intended to imply it to her . She was badly frightened , very much aware of it , trying to decide how to handle the incredibly bad turn the situation Wright have taken . Volcheme , having hurried Tornull off to make sure the space shuttle , which had been left beside the buildmg'slanding dock , was within the section 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Have you decided what happened out there ? " Galester shrugged . " It appears to be a selective antipersonnelweapon . The truck presumably was enclosed by the charge because there was somebody still on it . But it shows no sign of damage , while the clothing the nun outside were wearing disappeared with them . It 's Iu , sible the weapon is stationed outside the Depot and bred the charge through the open lock . But my opinion s that it 's being operated from some concealed pointwithin the Depot . " Volcheme looked at Hishkan . " Well ? Could it havep112been something that was among your specimens here ? Something Miss Gems and Wergard discovered and that Wergard put to use just now ? " The scientist gave Danestar a startled glance . Danestar said evenly , " Forget that notion , Volcheme . It does n't make sense . " " Does n't it ? What else makes sense ? " the smuggler demanded . " You 've been here two weeks . You 're clever people , as you 've demonstrated . Clever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under your noses . Clever enough to try to frighten competitors away . You know what I think , Miss Gems ? I think that when I showed up here today , it loused up the private plans you and Wergard had for Hishkan 's specimen . " " We do have plans for it , " said Danestar . " It goes to the Federation . And now you 'd better help us see it gets there . " Volcheme almost laughed . " I should ? " Danestar said , " You asked what else makes sense . There 's one thing that does . You might have thought of it . That U-League specimen did n't just happen to be drifting around in the Pit where it was found . Somebody made it and put it there ! " She had the full attention of everyone in the office now , went on quickly . It was a space-signaling device which could tell human scientists a nearly complete story of how its unknown designers were able to move about freely in the dust cloud and how they communicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the information that human beings had the space instrument . The static bursts he 'd produced had been recorded a great deal farther away from Mezmiali than the Pit . Volcheme interrupted with angry incredulity . " So you 're suggesting aliens from the Pit have come here for it ! " " I 'm suggesting just that , " Danestar said . " And Dr.p113Hishkan , at least , must be aware that a ship which vanished in the Pit a few years ago reported it was being attacked with what appeared to be radiation weapons . " " That 's true ! That 's true ! " Dr. Hishkan 's face was white . " I think , " Danestar told them , " that when that airtruckcame into the Depot , something came in with it the truckers did n't know was there . Something that had a radiation weapon of a kind we do n't know about . Volcheme , if you people have a single functioning brain cell left between you , you 'll tell the control building right now to put out a call for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want the heaviest Navy ships near Mezmiali to get down here to handle this , and " Volcheme ! " a voice cut in urgently from the screen communicator . The smuggler 's head turned . " Go ahead , Yee ! " His voice was harsh with impatience . " The U-League group that 's been hunting for this Wergard fellow does n't answer ! " Yee announced . He was the man Volcheme had stationed in the control building . " Seven men  --  two wearing communicators . We 've been trying to contact them for eight minutes . Looks like they might have got wiped out somewhere in the Depot the same way as the truck crew ! " There was an uneasy stir among the men in the office . Volcheme said sharply , " Do n't jump to conclusions ! ! lave the operators keep calling them . They may have some reason for staying quiet at the moment . The others have checked in ? " " Yes , " said Yee . " Everyone else who is n't in the controlbuilding is sitting tight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told to stay where they are and report ; anything they observe ? " " Yes . But nobody 's reported anything yet . "  | " Let me , know as soon as someone does . And , Yee , make very sure everyone in the control building is aware that until this matter is settled , the control building takes orders only from me . " " They 're real aware of that , Volcheme , " said Yee . The smuggler turned back to the group in the office . " Of course , we 're not going to be stupid enough to take Miss Gems 's advice ! " he said . If he felt any uncertainty , it did n't show in his voice or face . " Somebody has pulled a surprise trick with some radiation device and killed a number of people . But we 're on guard now , and we 're very far from helpless ! Decrain will stay here to make sure Miss Gems does not attempt to interfere in any way . The rest of us will act as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ searching for Wergard . " There are four high-powered energy rifles on the shuttle . You four will handle them . Galester , Dr. Hishkan , Tornull , and I will have handguns . Dr. Hishkan tells me that the radiation suits used for dangerous inspectionwork in the Depot are stored on the ground level of this building . " Remember , this device is an antipersonnel weapon . We 'll be in the suits , which will block its effect on us at least temporarily ; we 'll be armed , and we 'll be in the shuttel . There 's a barrier exit at the building loading dock , through which we can get the shuttle out into the Depot . Scanscreens are being used in the control building to locate the device or its operator . When they 're found The communicator clicked . Wergard 's voice said , " Volcheme , this is Wergard . Better listen ! " Volcheme 's head swung around . " What do you want ? " It was almost a snarl . " If you 'd like a look at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " switch your screen to Section Thirty-six . You may change your mind about chasing it around in the shuttle . "  |p115A  few seconds later , the wall screen flickered and cleared . For an instant , they all stared in silence . Like a sheet of living purple fire , the thing flowed with eerie swiftness along the surface of one of the Depot 's side streets toward a looming warehouse . Its size , Danestar thought , was the immediately startling factor  --  it spread across the full width of the street and was a hundred and fifty , perhaps two hundred , yards long . As it reached the warehouse , the big building 's defense field flared into activity . Instantly , the fiery apparition veered sideways , whipped around the corner of the street and was gone from sight . Shifting views of the Depot flicked through the screen as Dr. Hishkan hurriedly manipulated the controls . He glanced around , eyes wide and excited . " I 've lost it ! It appears to be nowhere in the area . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It will show up again . " He asked Galester , " What did you make of that ? What is it ? " Galester said , " It 's identical , of course , with what we saw engulfing the truck and the men at the lock . We saw only one section of it there . It emerged partly above the surface of the Depot and withdrew into it again . As to what it is . . . " He shrugged . " I know of nothing to compareit to precisely ! " He hesitated again , went on . " My impression was that it was moving purposefully  --  directingitself . Conceivably an energy weapon could control a mobile charge in such a manner that it would present that appearance . " Dr. Hishkan added , " Whatever this is , Volcheme , I believe it would be very unwise to attempt to oppose it with standard weapons ! " The smuggler gave him a tight grin . " Since there 's no immediate need to make the attempt , we 'll postpone it , at any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what we just saw was that the thing avoided contact with the defense field of that building . . . or was turned awayp116from it , if it 's the mobile guided charge Galester was talking about . In either case , our enemy ca n't reach us until we decide what we 're dealing with and how we should deal with it . " Danestar said sharply , " Volcheme , do n't be a fool  --  do n't count on that ! The ships that disappeared in the Pit carried defense fields , too . " Volcheme gave her a venomous glance but did n't answer . Dr. Hishkan said thoughtfully , " What Miss Gems says is technically true . But even if we are being subjected to a similar attack , this is a very different situation ! This complex was once a fort designed to defend a quarter of the continent against the heaviest of spaceborneweapons . And while the interior fields do not comparewith the external barrier in strength , they are still far denser than anything that would or could be carried by even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the field about this building to protect us while we consider means to extricate ourselves from the situation . " He added , " I feel far more optimistic now ! When we have determined the nature of the attacking entity , we should find a method of combating it available to us in the Depot . There is no need to appeal to the authorities for help , as Miss Gems suggested , and thereby have our personal plans exposed to them  --  which was , of course , what she intended ! " Wergard 's voice said from the communicator , " If you want to continue your studies , Dr. Hishkan , you 'll get the chance immediately ! The thing is now approaching the main building from the north , and it 's coming fast . " Dr. Hishkan turned quickly back to the screen controls . There was a wide square enclosed by large buildings directly north of the main one . The current of fire was half across the square as it came to view in the screen . As Wergard had said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purposeful malevolence in that rushing motion which sent a chill down Danestar 's spine . In an instant , it seemed , it reached the main building and the energy field shielding it ; and now , instead of veering off to the side as it had done before , the tip of the fiery body curved upwards . It flowed verticallyup along the wall of the building , inches away from the flickering defense field . For seconds , the wall screen showed nothing but pale purple flame streaming across it . Then the flame was gone ; and the empty square again filled the screen . From the communicator , Wergard 's voice said quickly , " It crossed the top of the building , went down the other side and disappeared below the ground level sur-face The voice broke off . Almost immediately , it resumed . " I 've had more luck keeping it in view than you . It 's been half around the Depot by now , and my impression is it 's been looking things over before it makes its next move  --  whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've noticed makes me feel much less secure behind a section energy field than some of you people think you are . The thing has kept carefully away from the outer Depot barrier  --  a hundred yards or so at all times  --  and it cuts its speed down sharply when it gets anywhere near that limit . On the other hand , as you saw just now , it shows very little respect for the sectional building fields . I have n't seen it attempt to penetrate one of them , but it 's actually contacted them a number of times without apparent harm to itself , as it did again in passing over the main building a moment ago . " Volcheme snapped , " What 's that supposed to tell us ? " " I think , " Wergard said , " that , among other things , our visitor has been testing the strength of those barriers . I would n't care to bet my life on what it 's concluded , asyou seem willing to do ! Another point  --  it may be devel/oping a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggest you take a close look at the square on the north again . " At first glance , the square still seemed empty . Then one noticed that its flat surface was alive with tiny sparks , with flickers and ripplings of pale light . The thing was there , almost completely submerged beneath the Depot 's ground level , apparently unmoving . Tornull said , staring fascinatedly , " Perhaps it knows we have that specimen in here ! " Nobody answered . But in the square , as if aware its presence had been discovered , the fire shape rose slowly to the surface of the ground until it lay in full view , flat and monstrous , sideways to the main building . The silence in the office was broken suddenly by a chattering sound . It had not been a loud noise , but everyone started nervously and looked over at the table where the pile of instruments had been assembled . " What was that ? " Volcheme demanded . " My shortcode transmitter , " Danestar told him . " It 's recorded a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I 'm not sure , " said Danestar evenly . " But let 's guess . It 's not from outside the Depot because shortcode wo n't go through the barrier . It 's not from Wergard , and it 's not from one of your people . What 's left ? " The smuggler stared at her . " That 's an insane sug-gestion ! " " Perhaps , " Danestar said . " Why do n't we listen to the translation ? " " We will ! " Volcheme jerked his head at Decrain . " Go over to the table with her . She is n't to touch anything but the transmitter ! " He watched , mouth twisted unpleasantly , as Decrain followed Danestar to the table . She picked up the minia/ture transmitter , slid a fingernail quickly along a groove to the phonetic translator switch . As she set the instrumentback on the table , the words began . " Who . . . has . . . it . . . where . . . is ... it . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . has . . . it . . . where ... " It went on for perhaps a minute and a half , three sentences repeated monotonously over and over , then stopped with a click . Danestar was n't immediately aware of the effect on the others . She 'd listened in a mixture of fear , grief , hatred , and sick revulsion . Shortcode was speech , transmitted in an economical flash , restored to phonetic speech in the translator at the reception point . Each of the words which made up the three sentences had been pronounced at one time by a human being , were so faithfully reproduced one could tell the sentences had , in fact , been patched together with words taken individually from the speech of three or four different human beings . Human beings captured by the enemy in the Pit , Danestar thought , long dead now , but allowed to live while the enemy learned human speech from them , recorded their voices for future use ... . She looked around . The others seemed as shaken as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubted that the owner of the alien instrument had come to claim it . Dr. Hishkan remarked carefully , " If it should turn out that . we are unable to destroy or control this creature , it Is possible we can get rid of it simply by reassembling the device it 's looking for and placing it outside the defense screen . If it picks it up , we can open the barrier lock as an indication of our willingness to let it depart in peace with its property . " Volcheme looked at him . " Doctor , " he said , " do n't panic just because you 've heard the thing talk to you ! What this does seem to prove is that the specimen you 're wiling through us is at least as valuable as it appeared top120be  --  and I for one do n't intend to be cheated out of my profit . " " Nor I , " Dr. Hishkan said hastily . " But the creature 's ability to utilize shortcode to address us indicates a dangerouslevel of intelligence . Do you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Galester interrupted , indicating the screen . " I believe it 's beginning to move .... " There was silence again as they watched the fire body in the square . Its purple luminescence deepened and paled in slowly pulsing waves ; then the tip swung about , swift as a flicking tongue , first toward the building , then away from it ; and the thing flowed in a darting curve across the square and into a side street . " Going to nose around for its treasure somewhere else ! " Volcheme said after it had vanished . " So , while it may suspect it 's here , it is n't sure . I 'm less impressed by its apparent intelligence than you are , Doctor . A stupid man can learn to use a complicated instrument , if somebodyshows him how to do it . This may be a stupid alien ... a soldier type sent here from the Pit to carry out a specific , limited mission . " Galester nodded . " Possibly a robot . " " Possibly a robot , " Volcheme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment ago , Doctor  --  yes , I have thought of a way to get it off our necks . " " What 's that ? " Dr. Hishkan inquired eagerly . " No need to discuss it here ! " Volcheme gave Danestar a glance of mingled malevolence and triumph . She understoodits meaning well enough . If Wergard could be located , Volcheme could now rid himself of the Kyth operators with impunity . There were plenty of witnesses to testify that the monstrous creature which had invaded the Depot had destroyed over a dozen men . She and Wergardwould be put down as two more of its victims . " We wo n't use the shuttle at present , " Volcheme wentp121on . " But we want the portable guns , and we 'll get ourselvesinto antiradiation suits immediately . Decrain , watch the lady until we get back  --  use any methods necessary to make sure she stays where she is and behaves herself . We 'll bring a suit back up for you . The rest of you come along . Hurry ! " Decrain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the others filed quickly out of the office and started down the hall to the right . The big man looked uneasy . With a gigantic fiery alien around , he Wright not appreciate being left alone to guard the prisonerwhile his companions climbed into the security of antiradiation suits . As the last of the group disappeared , lie sighed heavily , shifted his attention back to Danestar . His eyes went huge with shocked surprise . The chair In which she had been sitting was empty . Decrain 's hand flashed to his gun holster , stopped as it touched it . He stood perfectly still . Something hard was pushing against the center of his back below his shoulder blades . " Yes , I 've got it , " Danestar whispered behind him . " Not a sound , Decrain ! If you even breathe louder than I like , I 'll split your spine ! " They waited in silence . Decrain breathed cautiously while the voices and footsteps in the hall grew fainter , became inaudible . Then the gun muzzle stopped pressing against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ softly  --  she 'd moved off but was still close behind him  --  " just stand there now ! " Decrain moistened his lips . " Miss Gems , " he said , speaking with some difficulty , " I was , you remember , a gentleman ! " " So you were , buster , " her voice agreed . " And a very fortunate thing that is for you at the moment . But Decrain dropped forward , turning in the air , lashing out savagely with both feet in the direction of the voice.  |p122It  was a trick that worked about half the time . A blurred glimpse of Danestar flashing a white smile above him and of her arm swinging down told him it had n't worked here . The butt of the gun caught the side of his head a solid wallop , and Decrain closed his eyes and drifted far , far away . She bent over him an instant , half minded to give him a second rap for insurance , decided it was n't necessary , shoved the gun into a pocket of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the center of the office . Her control belt was there among the jumble of things they 'd brought over from her room . Danestar fastened it about her waist , slipped on the white jacket lying beside it , rummaged hurriedly among the rest , storing the shortcodetransmitter and half a dozen other items into various pockets before she picked up her emptied instrumentvalise and moved to the opposite end of the table where Galester had arranged the mechanisms he 'd removed for examination from the false asteroid . She 'd had her eye on one of those devices since she 'd been brought to the office . It was enclosed in some brassy pseudometal , about the size of a goose egg and shaped like one . Galester hadn't. known what to make of it in his brief investigation , and Dr. Hishkan had offered only vague conjectures ; but she had studied it and its relationship to a number of other instruments very carefully on the night she 'd been in Dr. Hishkan 's vault , and knew exactly what to make of it . She placed it inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own instruments , turned on the spy screen and fingered a switch on the control belt . The spy screen made a staccatochirping noise . " I 'm alone here , " she told it quickly . " Decrain 's out cold . Now , how do I get out of this building and to some rendezvous point  --  fastest ? Volcheme 's gone berserk , as you heard . I do n't want to be anywhere nearp123them when they start playing games with that animated slice of sheet lightning ! " " Turn left when you leave the office , " Wergard 's voice said from the blank screen . " Take the first elevator two levels down and get out . " " And then ? " " I 'll be waiting for you there . " " How long have you been in the building ? " she asked , startled . " About five minutes . Came over to pick up a couple of those antiradiation suits for us , which I have . The way things were going then , I thought I 'd better hang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from our friends . I was about to start upstairs when Volcheme and the others left . Then I heard a little commotion in the office and decided you were doing something about Decrain . So I waited . " " Bless you , boy ! " Danestar said gratefully . " Be with you in a minute ! " She switched off the spy screen , went out of the office , skirting Decrain 's harshly snoring form on the carpet , and turned left down the quiet hall . The hideaway from which Corvin Wergard had been keeping an observer 's eye on events in the Depot was one of a number he 'd set up for emergency use shortly after their arrival . He 'd selected it for operations today because it was only a few steps from an exit door in the building , and less than a hundred and twenty yards from both the control section and the outer barrier lock  --  potential critical points in whatever action would develop . Guiding Danestar back to it took minutes longer than either of them liked , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structures shielded from the alien visitor by section defense screens . She sat across the tiny room from him , enclosed inp124one of the bulky antiradiation suits , the shortcode transmitter on a wall shelf before her , fingers delicately , minutely , adjusting another of the instruments she had brought back from Hishkan 's office . Her eyes were fixed on the projection field above the instrument . Occasional squigglings and ripples of light flashed through it  --  meaningless static . But she 'd had glimpses of light patterns which seemed far from meaningless here , was tracking them now through the commband detector to establish the settings which would fix them in the visual projection field for study . That was a nearly automatic process  --  her hands knew what to do and were doing it . Her thoughts kept turning in nightmare fascination about other aspects of the gigantic raider . What did they know about it ? And what did it know about them ? That living , deadly energy body , or its kind , had not built the signaling device . If it was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pit , the masters had not built the device , either . Regardless of its origin , the instrument , though centuries old , still had been in use ; and in the dust cloud its value in establishing location , in permitting free purposeful action , must be immense . But whoever was using it evidently had lacked even the ability to keep it in repair . Much less would they have been able to replace it after it disappeared  --  and they must be in mortal fear that mankind would discover the secrets of the instrument and return to meet them on even terms in the cloud ... . So this creature had traversed deep space to reach Mezmiali and recover it . Volcheme , conditioned to success in dealing with human opponents , still believed his resourcefulness was sufficient to permit him to handle the emissary from the Pit . To Danestar it seemed approximately like attempting to handle an animated warship . The thing was complex ,  |p125not  simply an elemental force directed by a limited robotic mind . It had demonstrated it could use its energiesto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd had in the detector 's field of one of its patternsimplied it was capable of much more than had been shown so far . And it might not have come here alone . There could be others of its kind undetected beyond the Depot 's barrier with whom it was in communication . I n the face of such possibilities , Volcheme 's determinationamounted to lunacy . They might have convinced the others of the need to call for outside help ; but the intercomsystem had been shut off , evidently on the smuggler'sorders , when Danestar 's escape was discovered . Through various spy devices they knew he was coordinatingthe activities of his men with personal communicators , and that a sectional force barrier was being set up across the center of the main building , connected to the external ones . Completed , the barrier system would transformhalf the building into a box trap , open at the end . The men and the specimen from the Pit would be in the other half . When the monster flowed into the trap to get at them , observers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the open end . The thing would be safely inside . . . assuming that barriers of sectional strength were impassable to it . Volcheme 's calculations were based entirely on that assumption . So far , nothing had happened to prove him wrong . The alien creature was still moving about the 1 ) epot . Wergard , before the multiple-view screen through which he had followed the earlier events of the day , reported glimpses of it every minute or two . And there were increasing indications of purpose in its motions . It had passed along this building once , paused briefly . But it had shown itself three times about the control section , three times at the main building . Its interest appeared to be centering on those points.  |p126Until  it ended its swift and unpredictable prowling , they could only wait here . Wergard was ready to slip over to a personnel lock in the barrier about the control building when an opportunity came . A gas charge would knock out the men inside , and the main barrier would open long enough then to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would be to stay alive until help arrived . Their heads turned sharply as the shortcode transmitteron the shelf before Danestar gave its chattering pickup signal . She stood up , snapped the headpiece of her radiation suit into position , collapsed the other instrumentson the shelf , slid them into the suit 's pockets , and picked up the valise she 'd brought back from Dr. Hishkan 's office. ... where ... is ... it ... I ... want ... it ... " whispered the transmitter . " Pickup range still set at thirty yards ? " Wergard asked . " Yes , " she said . " There 's nothing in sight around here . " Danestar glanced over at him . He 'd encased himself in the other radiation suit . A small high-power energy carbinelay across a chair beside him . His eyes were on the viewscreen which now showed only the area immediately around the building . She did n't answer . The transmitter continued to whisper . It was n't in sight , but it was nearby . Very near . Within thirty yards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And pausing now much longer than it had the first time it passed the building. ... who ... has ... it ... where ... is ... it ... " Her skin crawled , icy and uncontrollable . If it had any way of sensing what she held concealed inside the valise , it would want it . She did n't think it could . No spying device she knew of could pierce the covering of the valise.  |p127But  the egg-shaped alien instrument within  --  no bigger than her two fists placed together  --  was the heart and core of the specimen from the Pit , its black box , the part which must hold all significant clues to the range and penetrating power of its signals . Without it , the rest of the contents of that great boulder-shaped thing would he of no use now  --  to Volcheme or to the alien . They waited , eyes on the viewscreen , ready to move . If the building was attacked and the creature showed it could force its way through the enclosing energy barrier , there was an unlocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door ; and two levels down , they would be in the underground tunnel system where a transport shell waited . If they were followed , they could continue along the escape route Wergard had marked out , moving from barrier to barrier to slow the pursuer. l finless it overtook them , they would eventually reach the eastern section of the Depot , known as the Keep , where ancient defense screens formed so dense a honeycomb that they should be safe for hours from even the most persistent attacks . But retreat would cost them their chance to make use of the control section ... . The transmitter 's whisper faded suddenly . For some seconds , neither stirred . Then Wergard said , relief sharp in his voice , " It may have moved off ! " He shifted the screen mechanisms . A pattern of half a dozen simultaneous views appeared . " There it is ! " On the far side of the control building , flowing purple lire lifted into view along fifty yards of one of the Depot 's streets like the back of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Danestar hesitated , took the commbanddetector quickly out of her suit pocket , placed it on the wall shelf . She pressed a button on the little instrument and the projection field sprang into semivisibilityabove it.  |p128Wergard  , eyes shifting about the viewscreen , said , " It 's still only seconds away from us . Do n't get too absorbed in whatever you 're trying to do . " " I wo n't . " Danestar released the bulky radiation headpiece , turned it back out of her way . Her fingertips slipped along the side of the detector , touched a tiny adjustment knob , began a fractional turn , froze . The visual projection she 'd been hunting had appeared in the field before her . A flickering , shifting , glowing galaxy of tiny momentarysparks and lines of light . . . the combined communication'systems of a megacity might have presented approximately such a picture if the projector had presented them simultaneously . She licked her lips , breath still , as her fingers shifted cautiously , locking the settings into place . When she drew her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 's that ? " " The thing 's intercom system . It 's . . . let me think  --  Wergard ! What 's it doing now ? " " It 's beside the control building . " Wergard paused . He had n't asked what her manipulations with the detectorwere about ; she seemed to be on the trail of something , and he had n't wanted to distract her . But now he added , " Its behavior indicates . . . yes ! Apparently it is going to try to pass through the section barrier there ! " The viewscreen showed the ghostly , reddish glitteringof an activated defense barrier along most of the solid front wall of the control building . Two deep-rose glowing patches , perhaps a yard across , marked points where the alien had come into direct contact with the barrier 's energies . It had n't , Danestar thought , liked the experience , though in each case it had maintained the contact forp129seconds , evidently in a deliberate test of the barrier 's strength . Her eyes shifted in a brief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swarming lights in the projector field . The reaction of the creature could be observed better there . As it touched the barrier , dark stains had appeared in the patterns , spread , then faded quickly after it withdrew . There was a shock effect of sorts . But not a lasting one . Danestar 's breathing seemed constricted . She was badly frightened now . The section harriers did hurt this thing , but they would n't stop it if it was determined to force its way through their energies . Perhaps the men in the control building were n't yet aware of the fact . She did n't want to think of that She heard a brief exclamation from Wergard , glanced over again at the screen . And here it comes , she thought . The thing was rising unhurriedly out of the street surface before the control building , yards from the wall . When it tested the barrier , it had extruded a fiery pointed tentacle and touched it to the building . Now it surged into view as a rounded luminous column twenty feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the column began to lean slowly forward like a ponderous cresting wave , reached the wall , passed shuddering into it . The force field blazed in red brilliance about it and its own purple radiance flared , but the great mass continued to flow steadily through the barrier . And throughout the galaxy of dancing , scintillating , tiny lights in the projector field , Danestar watched long shock shadows sweep , darken , and spread . . . then graduallylighten and commence to fade . When she looked again at the viewscreen , the defensebarrier still blazed wildly . But the street was empty . The alien had vanished into the control building.  | " It is n't one being , " Danestar said . " It 's probably several billion . Like a city at work , an army on the march . An organization . A system . The force field did hurt it  --  but at most it lost one half of one percent of the entities that make it up in going through the barrier . " Wergard glanced at the projection field , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had access to a radiationsuit , " he said . " So they must have been dead in an instant when the thing reached them . If it can move through a section barrier with no more damage than you feel it took , why has n't it come out again ? It 's been in there for over five minutes now . " Danestar , eyes on the pattern in the projection field , said , " It may have been damaged in another way . I do n't know .... " " What do you mean ? " She nodded at the pattern . " It 's difficult to describe . But there 's a change there ! And it 's becoming more distinct . I 'm not sure what it means . " Wergard looked at the field a moment , shrugged . " I 'll take your word for it . It 's a jumble to me . I do n't see any changes in it . " Danestar hesitated . She had almost intuitive sensitivityfor the significance of her instruments ' indications ; and that something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the millionfold interplay of signals in the pattern seemed certain . She said suddenly , " There 's a directing center to the thing , of course , or it could n't function as it does . Before it went through the force field , every part of it was oriented to that center . There was a kind of rhythm to the whole which showed that . Now , there 's a section that 's going out of phase with the general rhythm . " " What does that add up to ? " Danestar shook her head . " I ca n't tell that yet . But if the shock it got from the barrier disrupted part of itsp131internal communication system , it might be , in our terms , at least partly paralyzed now . A percentage of the individual entities  --  say about one-tenth  --  are no longer coordinating with the whole , are disconnected from it .... Of course , we ca n't count on it , but it would explain why it has n't reappeared . " Both were silent a moment . Then Wergard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone in the control buildingbefore the shock got through to it . Otherwise we would have had indications of action by Volcheme by now . " She nodded . The intercom switch on the viewscreen was open , but the system remained dead . And whatever the smuggler and the group in the main building were engaged in , they were not at present in an area covered by her spy devices . But the space shuttle had not left the building , so they were still there . If the creature from the Pit was no longer a menace and Volcheme knew it , every survivor of the gang would be combing the Depot for traces of Wergard and herself . Since they were n't , Volcheme had received no such report from the controlbuilding . Whatever else had happened , the men stationed there had died as the alien poured in through the barrier . Her breath caught suddenly . She said , " Wergard , I think . . . it 's trying to come out again ! " " The barrier 's flickering , " he acknowledged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on now ! Afraid you 're right ! Watch for signs of damage . If it is n't crippled , and if it suspects someone is here , it may hit this building next , immediately ! It is n't in sight . . . must he moving out below ground level . " Danestar snapped the radiation headpiece back in position without taking her eyes from the projection field . Shock darkness crisscrossed the pattern of missed twinkling pinpoints of brightness again , deep/ened . She could judge the thing 's rate of progress through the barrier by that now . There were no indicationsof paralysis ; if anything , its passage seemed swifter . Within seconds , the darkness stopped spreading , began to fade . " It 's outside , " she said . " It does n't seem seriously injured . " " And it 's still not in sight , " said Wergard . " Stay ready to move ! " They were both on their feet . The shortcode transmitteron the shelf was silent , but this time the creature might not be announcing its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field . Again the barrier had achieved minor destruction , but she could make out no further significant changes . The cold probability was now that there was no practical limit to the number of such passages the creature could risk if it chose . But something about the pattern kept nagging at her mind . What was it ? A minute passed in a humming silence that stretched her nerves , another . . . and now , Danestar told herself , it was no longer likely that the monster 's attention would turn next to this building , to them . The barrier had remained quiet , and there had been no other sign of it . Perhaps it was n't certain humans were hiding here ; at any rate , it must have shifted by now to some other section of the Depot . Almost with the thought , she saw Wergard 's hand move on the viewscreen controls , and in the screen the area about them was replaced by a multiple-view pattern . Nothing stirred in the various panels ; no defense field was ablaze about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed empty and quiet . " At a guess , " Wergard remarked thoughtfully , " it 's hanging around the main building again now ! " He moved back a step from the screen , still watching it , began to unfasten his antiradiation suit.  | " What are you doing ? " she asked . He glanced over at her . " Getting out of it . One thing these suits were n't made for is fast running . I expect to be doing some of the fastest running in my career in perhaps another minute or two . " " Running ? You 're not " Our alien , " Wergard said , " should take action concerningVolcheme 's boys next . But whatever it does , the instant we see it involved somewhere else , I 'll sprint b r the control building . It may be the last chance we get to yell for help from outside . And I do n't want to be slowed down by twenty pounds of suit while I 'm about it . " Danestar swallowed hard . He was right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No ! Do n't go there ! " she said sharply , surprising herself . He looked around in bewilderment . " Do n't go there ? What are you  --  watch that ! " His eyes had shifted back to the screen . For an instant , she could n't tell what he had seen . Then , just as the view began to blur into another , she found it . Volcheme 's space shuttle had darted out of the cover of the main building , swung right , was flashing up a wide street toward the eastern section of the Depot . " Making a run for the Keep ! " Wergard said harshly . IIe fingered the controls , following the shuttle from view section to view section . " They might just  --  no , there it is ! " The great fire body  --  flattened , elongated  --  whipped east between two warehouse complexes , a rushing brightnessfifty feet above the ground , vanished beyond the buildings . " Too fast for them ! " Wergard shook his head . " It k nows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhapstheir guns can check it ! You watch what happensI 'm going now . "  | " No ! I ... " Then at last the realization surged up . Danestar stared at him , completely dismayed . " It 's a trap , " she said evenly . " Of course ! " " What is ? What are you talking about ? " " The control building ! Do n't you see ? " She jerked her head at the projection field . " I said a section of the thing was splitting off from the main body ! When it came out through the barrier again , that section was n't showing any shock effects . I saw it but did n't understand what it meant . Of course ! It did n't come through the barrier at all . It 's still in there , Wergard ! In the controlbuilding . Waiting for any of us to show up . There 're two of them now .... " She watched stunned comprehension grow in his face as she spoke . The smugglers ' shuttle was caught not much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemy betweenit and the Keep section , turned back . When the space thing followed , tiny bursts of dazzling white light showed the shuttle 's energy guns were in action . The fire body jerked aside and paused . . . and now the shuttle turned again , flashed straight at its pursuer , guns blazing full out . For a moment , it seemed a successful maneuver . The great creature swept up out of the path of the machine , slipped over the top of a building , disappeared . The shuttle rushed on toward the Keep  --  and at the next corner a loop of purple radiance snared it , drove it smashing into a building front . The fire giant flowed down , sent the shuttle hurtling against the building again , closed over it . For seconds , the radiance pulsed about the engulfed vehicle , then lifted into the air , moved off . There was no sign of the shuttle until , some hundreds of yards away , the fire body opened to let the shattered machine slide out , drop to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away ; and Volcheme and his companions clearly were no longer within it . To Danestar , watching in sick fascination , it had seemed as if a great beast of prey had picked up some shelled , stinging creature , disarmed it , cracked it to draw out the living contents , and flung aside the empty shell . The alien swung west , toward the central section of the Depot , seemed to be returning to the main building complex , but then flowed down to the surface , sank into it and vanished . Minutes passed and it did not reappear . Again the Depot 's sections stood quiet and lifeless in the viewscreen . " It may be waiting for somebody else to break from cover , " Wergard said suddenly . " But you 'd think the first thing it would do now is push into the main building and get its gadget ! Volcheme must have left it there  --  the thing would n't have slammed the shuttle around like that if it had n't been sure the contraption was n't inside . " Danestar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Wergard was simply thinking aloud . They had no immediate explanation for the thing 's behavior . But it had been acting purposefully throughout , and there must be purpose in its disappearance . All they could do at present was wait , alert for signs of an approach on any level . She had discarded her antiradiation suit , as Wergard had done previously . I he men in the shuttle might have gained a second or two of life because of the protection the suits gave them ; hilt against so overwhelmingly powerful a creature they obviously had made no real difference . And they were cumbersome enough to be a serious disadvantage in other respects . If there were indications that thep136second energy body , the smaller one in the control building , had left it , Wergard would still attempt a dash over there . There were no such indications . There were , in fact , no indications of any kind of activity whatever until , approximately ten minutes after it vanished , the big space creature showed itself again . It was rising slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building when Wergard detectedit in the screen . Then , while they watched , it flowed deliberately up to the building and into it . And no defending force fields flared into action . As it disappeared , they exchanged startled looks . Wergard said quickly , " Volcheme must have had the barriers shut off just before they left by the lock  --  so the thing could pick up its device .... " " And let them get away ? " Danestar hesitated . There 'd been talk of that before she escaped from Volcheme 's group . But she was not at all certain that the . smuggler , even under such intense immediate pressures , would abandon his prize completely . The flight might even have been designed in part to draw the raider away from it . " Otherwise  --  " Wergard scowled , chewed his lip . " Has there been anything in the projection pattern to show it 's split again ? " She shook her head . " No . But if you 're thinking it could detach a section small enough to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's barrier " That 's what I 'm thinking . " Danestar shrugged , said , " I would n't be able to tell that , Wergard . I 've been watching the projection . But it would be too minor a difference to be noticeable . It may have done it . " He was silent a moment . " Well , " he said then , " it has the gadget it came for now . We 'll see what it does next . "  |p137He  added , without change of tone , " Incidentally , it does n't have all of it , does it ? " Danestar gave him a startled glance . " I low did you guess ? " she asked . A half-grin flicked over Wergard 's tense face . " It 's the sort of thing you 'd do . You 've been hanging on to that valise as if there were something very precious Inside . " There is , " Danestar agreed . " It 's not very big , but the specimen wo n't work without it . And when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they wo n't be able to t c p l ace it . " " Very dirty trick ! " Wergard said approvingly . He glanced at the valise . " Supposing we manage to get out of this alive  --  how useful could the item become ? " " Extremely useful , if it gets to really capable people . As far as I could make out , it must embody all the essentialsof that system . " Wergard nodded . " We 'll hang on to it , then . As long as we can , anyway . We may have to destroy it , of course . Think the thing could spot there 's a part missing ? " " It could if it has a way of testing it , " said Danestar . " But if the specimen 's been reassembled and resealed , nothing will show . . . . There the creature comes now ! " They watched its emergence from the main building . i t poured out of the landing lock area , swung west across the central square , moving swiftly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it had carried the shuttle . " Coming back here ! " Wergard remarked some seconds later . " And if it can open sectional barriers , it can open the main Depot lock in the control build-ing Danestar knew what he meant . The Pit creature aright believe it had achieved its objective in regainingp138the lost signaling instrument and simply leave now . She began to feel almost feverish with hope , warned herself it was much more probable it did not intend to let any human being in the Depot remain alive to tell about it . , Her gaze shifted again to the patterns in the projectionfield . No further changes had been apparent , but a sense of dissatisfaction , of missing some hidden significance , still stirred in her each time she studied them . I 'm not seeing everything they should tell me , she thought . She shook her head tiredly . Too much had happened these hours ! Now her thinking seemed dulled . She heard Wergard say , " It 's stopped for some-thing ! " It had come to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , moved swiftly past three buildings , checked again before a fourth . A probing fire tentacle reached toward the building , and defense barriers promptly blazed into activity . The creature withdrew the tentacle , remained where it was , half submerged in the street . Activated by its proximity , the defense field continued to flare while one or two minutes passed . Then the field subsided , vanished . The creature moved forward until ! i some two-thirds of it appeared to be within the building . Barely seconds later , it drew back again , swung away .... " It caught somebody inside there ! " Wergard said . " It could n't have been looking for anything else . How did it know some poor devils had holed up in that particularsection ? " The intercom signal on the viewscreen burred sharply with his last words , then stopped . They stared at it , glanced at each other . Neither attempted to move toward the switch . The intercom began ringing again . It rang , insist/only , jarringly , with brief pauses , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So that 's how ! " Wergard said heavily . He shrugged . " Well , if it  --  or a section of it  --  can manipulate a barrierlock and reproduce shortcode impulses , it can grasp and manipulate an intercom system . Not a bad way to locate survivors . If we do n't answer " We ca n't stay here , anyway , " Danestar told him , frowning at the projection field . She had spoken in an oddly flat , detached manner . No . It 's mopping up before it heads home  --  and now it can apparently cut off every sectional barrier that is n't locally maintained directly from the control building . It wo n't be long before it discovers that  --  if it has n't already done it . " Wergard picked up the energy gun . " Grab what you need and let 's move ! I 've thought of something better than trying to make it to the Keep and playing hide-and-seek with it there . With the tricks it 's developed , we would n't last  --  " He looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Danestar glanced around at him , bemused , lips farted . " Yes ? I ... " " Wake up ! " Wergard 's voice was edged with nervous impatience . " I think I can work us over to the section the thing just cleared out . If we leave the barrier off , there 's a good chance it wo n't check that building again . Let 's not hang around here ! " " No . " She shook her head , turned to the instrumeatson the shelf . " You 've got to get me to our quarters , We rga rd  --  immediately ! " " From here ? Impossible ! There 're several stretchesover three hundred yards in all  --  where we 'd be in the open without the slightest cover . It 's suicide ! We  --  " Wergard checked himself , staring at her . " You 've thought up something ? Is it going to work ? " " It might , if we can get there . "  |p140He  swore , blinked in scowling reflection . " All right ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope ! Tell me on the way or when we 're there what you 're after . We 'll make a short detour . There 's something I could do to keep our friend occupied for a while . It may buy us an additional twenty , thirty minutes .... " Hurrying up a narrow dim passage behind Wergard , Danestar felt clusters of eerie fears hurry along with her . Wergard swung on at a fast walking pace . Now and then she broke into a run to keep up with him ; and when she did , he slowed instantly to let her walk again . It was sensible  --  they might have running enough to do shortly . But staying sensible was n't easy . Her legs wanted to run . They were blind here , she thought . Her awareness of it was what had built up the feeling of frightened helplessnessduring the past minutes to the point where it seemed hardly bearable . She could n't use her instruments , and the sectional barriers in this area were turned off ; they were also deprived of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alien had discovered the force fields could be operated from the central controloffice . The Depot was open to it now except in sectionswhere human beings had taken refuge and cut in defense barriers under local control . Such points , of course , were the ones it would investigate . And they might encounter it at any moment , with no warning at all . Whether they got through to their quartershad become a matter of luck  --  good luck or bad  --  and Danestar , who always prepared , always planned , found herself unable to accept that condition . Wergard halted ahead of her ; and she stopped , watched him cautiously edge a door open , glance out . He looked back , slid the energy carbine from his shoulder , held it in one hand , made a beckoning motion withp141the other . Danestar followed him through the door and he cased it back into its lock . They had come out into one of the Depot 's side streets . It stretched away on either side between unbroken building fronts , a strip of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They darted across the street , ran fifty feet along the building on the far side before Wergard stopped at anotherdoor . This one opened on a pitch-dark passage ; arid , a moment later , the darkness closed in about them . Wergard produced a light , said quietly , " Watch your step , here ! The section was sealed off officially fifty years ago and apparently has n't been inspected since . " Ile moved ahead , rapidly but carefully , holding the light down for her . They were some five minutes from their starting point . Beyond that , Danestar did not know what part of the Depot they 'd come to , but Wergard had told her about this building . It had been part of the old fortress system , cheaper to seal off than remove , an emergency unit station which operated the harrier defenses of the complexes surrounding it . If the equipment was still in working order , Wergard would turn on those barriers . Approximately a tenth of the Deopt would again be shielded then , beyond manipulationby the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention to the area , while they moved on . Their living quarters were in a building a considerable distance away . Eyes shifting about , Danestar followed the pool of light dancing ahead of her feet . The flooring was decayed law c and there ; little piles of undefinable litter lay about , turd the air was stale and musty . Wergard , in his prowl -- ing , might in fact have been the first to enter the building in fifty years . They turned a corner of the passage , came to a dark doorspace . There he stopped . " You 'd better wait here , " he told her . " There 's a mess of machinery inside , and some of it 's broken . I 'll have top142climb around and over it . If the barrier system is operating , I 'll have it going within three or four minutes . " He vanished through the door . Danestar watched the receding light as it moved jerkily deeper into a forest of ancient machines , lost it when it went suddenly around a corner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lighter in her pocket but left it there . No need to nourish the swirling tide of apprehensionswithin her by peering about at shadows . Darkness was n't the enemy . After a minute or two , she heard a succession of metallic sounds in the distance . Presently they ended , and a little later Wergard returned . He was breathing hard and his face was covered with dirtstreakedsweat . " As far as I can make out , the barriers are on , " he said briefly . " Now we 'd better get out of the neighborhoodfast ! " But they made slower over-all progress than before , because now they had to use the personnel locks in the force fields as they moved from one complex section to the next . In between , they ran where they could . They crossed two more side streets . After the second one , Wergard said , " At the end of this building we 'll be out of the screened area . " " How far beyond that ? " Danestar asked . " Three blocks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We could use the underground systems along part of the stretch . But they wo n't get us across the main streets unless we follow them all the way to the Keep and back down . " She shook her head . " Let 's stick to your route . " A transport shell of the underground system could have taken them to the Keep and into the far side of the Depot in minutes . But its use would register on betraying instruments in the control building , and might too easily draw the alien to the moving shell.  |p143The  personnel lock at the other end of the building let them into a narrow alley . Across it was the flank of one of the Depot 's giant warehouses . As they started along the alley , there was a crackling , spitting , explosivesound  --  the snarl of a defense field flashing into action . Wergard reached out , snatched the valise from Danestar 's hand . " Run ! " They raced up the alley . The furious crackle of the force field came from behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far away , and it was continuing . A hundred yards on , Wergard halted abruptly , caught Danestar as she plowed into him , thrust the valise at her . " Here  --  ! " he gasped . She saw they 'd reached a door to the warehouse ; now Wergard was turning to open it . Clutching the valise , thoughts a roiling confusion of terror , she looked back , half expecting to see a wave of purple fire sweeping up the alley toward them . But the alley was empty , though the building front along which the barrier blazed was only a few hundred yards away . Then , as Wergard caught her arm , hauled her in through the door , a closer section  --  the building from which they had emerged a moment before  --  erupted in glittering fury . The door slammed in back of her , and they were running again , through a great kill , along aisles between high-stacked rows of packingcases . And  --  where was the valise ? Then she realliedWergard had taken it . She followed him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the end of the hall was ahead , a wide passage leading off it . She had a glimpse of Wergard 's strained face looking back for her ; then , suddenly , he swerved aside against the line of cases , crouched , his free arm making a violent gesture , motioning her to the floor.  |p144Danestar  dropped instantly . A moment later , he was next to her . " Keep . . . down ! " he warned . " Way . . . down ! " Sobbing for breath , flattened against the cases , she twisted her head around , saw what he was staring at over the stacked rows behind them . A pale purple reflectionwent gliding silently along the ceiling at the far end of the hall , seemed to strengthen for an instant , abruptly faded out . They scrambled to their feet , ran on into the passage . Even after they 'd slowed to a walk again , had reached a structure beyond the warehouse , they did n't talk about it much . Both were badly winded and shaken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have failed to detect them . Its attention must have been wholly on the force fields it was skirting , even as a sectionof it flowed through the warehouse within a few hundred feet of them . If they 'd been a few seconds later reaching the alley .. . Danestar reached into her white jacket , turning up its cooling unit . Wergard glanced at her . His face was dripping sweat . He wiped at it with his sleeve . She asked , " You 're still wearing the sneaksuit ? " Wergard lifted a strand of transparent webbing from under his collar , let it snap back . " Think it might have helped ? " " I do n't know . " But the creature might have the equivalent of a life detector unit as part of its sensory equipment , and a sneaksuit , distorting and blurring the energy patterns of a living body , would perhaps afford some protection . She said , " I 'll get into one as soon as we reach our quarters . It may have known somebody was around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human until it found out why the defense barriers were turned on again in that area . " Wergard remarked dubiously , " It seems to me it'sp145gilt picking up humans at the top of its priority list ! " After a moment , he added , " The long sprint comes next . Feel up to it ? " Danestar looked at him . " I 'd better feel up to it ! If we sec that thing again  --  I 'm one inch this side of purePanic right now ! " Ile grunted . " Quit bragging ! " He slid the carbine from his shoulder . " It 's that door ahead . Let me have a look out first . " As he began to unlock the door , Danestar found her -- self glancing back automatically once more at the long , lit , empty corridor through which they had come , their hurried steps echoing in the silence of the building . Then she saw Wergard had paused , half crouched and motionless , at the barely opened door . " What is it ? " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The face he turned to her was twirled and apprehensive . " Come up and take a look ! " She moved to where she could look out past him . After a moment , she said , " There are adjustment instrumentsfor the Depot lighting somewhere in the control section . " " Uh-huh , " said Wergard . " Another item that 's been sealed away for a hundred years or so . But our Number Two Thing in the control building seems to have got to them . 1 'd like to know what it means . " Ile opened the door wider . Both moved forward carefully , glancing along the street outside . I his was one of the main streets of the Depot . Across from them , a hundred and fifty yards away , was the massive white front of the structure which housed the central generators . Approximately two hundred yards to the left , it was pierced by a small entrace door which was the next step on Wergard 's route to their quarters . 1 west and east , the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossed it.  |p146But  all this was in semidarkness now ; too dim to let them make out the door in the wall of the generator building from where they stood . A hazy brightness above the line of buildings across the street indicated the rest of the Depot was still flooded by the projection lighting system which was that of the old fortress  --  . wearproof and ageless . If not deliberately tampered with , it would go on filling the Depot with eternal daybrightnessfor millenia . But something had tampered with it . . . and was still tampering with it . As they looked , the gloom along the street deepened perceptibly , then , slowly , lightened to its previous level . " There ca n't be much light in the Pit , of course , " Wergard said , staring up the street to the west . The controlsection , Danestar realized suddenly , lay in that direction . " It may be trying to improve visibility in the Depot for its perceptions . " " Or , " said Danestar , " ruin visibility for ours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have the time left to try another route , " he said . " Whatever it 's doing , we may make a mistake in crossing the street while it 's experimenting . But waiting here makes no sense . " She shook her head . " The intention might be to keep us waiting here . " " Yes , I thought of that . So let 's go . Right now . Top speed across . I 'll stay behind you . " For an instant , Danestar hesitated . Her feeling that the uncertain darkness of the wide street was under the scrutiny of alien senses , that they would be observed and tracked , like small scuttling animals , as soon as they left the shelter of the doorway , became almost a convictionin that moment . The fact remained that they could not stay where they were . . . . She tightened her grip on the handle of the valise , drew a deep breath , darted out.  |p147They  were half across when the darkness thickened so completely that they might have moved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was an abrupt mental shock . She faltered , almost stumbled , felt she And swerved from the line she was following , tried to turn n back to it . . . suddenly did n't know at all in which direction to move . Now panic closed in . " Wergard ! " " That way ! " His voice , hoarse and strained , was on her right , rather than behind her . As she turned toward it , his light flicked on , narrowed to a pale thread , marking small circle on the wall of the generator building aheadDanestar . She was hurrying toward the wall again as the thread of light cut out . . . and seconds later , the wall and the street began to reappear , dim and vague as be -- fore , but tangibly present . They reached the wall together , turned left along it . Again the street darkened , came lost in absolute blackness . Wergard 's hand caught her arm . " Just walk . . . . " He added something , muttered and indistinct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , breathing raggedly . Wergard 's hand remained on Danestar 's arm . The darkness lightened a trifle , grew dense again . " Hold on a moment ! " Wergard said , very softly . She stopped instantly , stood unmoving , let her breath out slowly . Wergard 's hand left her arm . She had an impression of cautious motion from him , decided he 'd raised the carbine to fire-ready position . Then he , too , was still . He 'd speak when he thought he could . Danestar 's eyes shifted quickly , scanning the unrelieved dark about them . The only sound was a dim faint hum of machinery from within the structure on their right . Then she realized something had appeared in her field of vision . It was ahead and to the left . A small pale patch ofp148purple luminescence , moving swiftly but in an oddly jerky manner , its outline shifting and wavering , as it approached their path at what might be a right angle . How far away ? If it was touching the ground , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be at least two hundred yards farther up the street . That would make it a considerablylarger thing than her first impression had suggested . As these calculations flicked through her mind , their object passed by ahead , moved on to the right , abruptly vanished . " You saw it ? " Wergard whispered . " Yes . " " Went in between a couple of buildings . Not so good  --  but it was some distance off . We do n't seem to have been noticed . Let 's go on . " Wergard had glimpsed another of the minor fire shapes just before they stopped . That one had been smaller  --  or farther away  --  and had been in sight for only an instant , on the left side of the street . " They should n't be too large to get through a personnellock and switch off a barrier for Thing Number One , " he said as they hurried along a catwalk in the generator building . " But that does n't necessarily mean Number One is in this area . " " Scouts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought . The Pit creature could have split off several dozen autonomous sections of itself of the size they had observed without noticeablyreducing its main bulk , and scattered them about the Depot to speed up the search for any humans still hiding out . The carbine could n't have done significant damage to the alien giant but should have the power to disrupt essential force patterns in these lesser replicas . " They do n't make things easier for us , " Wergard said ,  | " but we 'll have to show ourselves only once more . After that , we 'll have cover . And we can change our tactics a little .... " At the end of the generator building was the central street of the Depot , slightly wider than the last one they had crossed . It was almost startling to find it normally lit . Directly opposite was the entrance recess to another building . This was the final open stretch on the way to their quarters . Wergard mopped his forehead , asked , " Ready to try it ? " Danestar nodded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dread had its uses  --  her body had recognized an ultimate emergency and responded . She thought it would go on running now when she called on it until it fell dead . Wergard was wearing a sneaksuit ; she was n't . It was possible they were being followed , that the light-shapes they 'd seen were casting about in the area for the source of the life energy they 'd detected here , of which she was the focus . In that case , getting across the central street might be the point of greatest danger . They 'd decided she should go first while Wergard covered her with the carbine . He would follow as soon as she was within the other building . She slipped out the door ahead of him , drew a deep breath , ran straight across the too-silent , bright-lit street toward the entrance recess . And nothing happened . The carbine stayed quiet . The paving flowed by , and it seemed only an instant then before the building front swayed close before her . Danestar flung herself into the recess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the left , Wergard had said . Where ?  --  she discovered it next to her , pulled it open . For a moment , her mind seemed about to spin into insanity . Then she was backing away from the door ,  |p150screaming  with all her strength , while two shapes of pale fire glided out through it toward her . Somewhere , she heard the distant sharp snarl of the carbine . A blizzard of darting , writhing lines of purple light enveloped her suddenly , boiled in wild turmoil about the recess . The closer of the shapes had vanished , and the carbine was snarling again . Abruptly , her awareness was wiped out . " Got your third setting now , I think ! " Wergard announced . Danestar glanced at him . He sat at a table a few feet to her left , hunched forward , elbows planted on the table , face twisted in concentration as he peered at the tiny paper-flat instrument in his left hand . " Uh-huh , that 's it ! " He sighed heavily . " Four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thumb closed cautiously down on the device , shifted minutely , shifted back again . It was an attachment taken from Danestar 's commband detector . She had designed it , used it on occasion to intrude on covert communications in which she had a professional interest , sometimes blanking a band out gently at a critical moment , sometimes injectingmisinformation . But it was an instrument designed for her fingers , magical instruments themselves in their sensitized skill , deftness , and experience . It had not been designed for Wergard 's fingers , or anyone else 's ; and the only help she could give him with it was to tell him what must be done . Both hands were needed to operate the settings , and at present she could n't use her left hand . What had knocked her out in the building entrance , an instant before Wergard 's gun disrupted the second of the two Pit things that surprised her there , seemed to have been the approximate equivalent of a near miss from a bolt of lightning . Wergard had carried her two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , before she regained consciousness . Then she woke up suddenly , muscles knotted , trying to scream , voice thick and slurred when she started to answer Wergard 's questions . They discovered her left side was almost completely paralyzed , her tongue partly affected . As soon as he could make out what she wanted , what her plan had been , Wergard hauled her down to the ground-level barrier room of the building , along with an assortment of hastily selected gadgetry , settled her in a chair next to the barrier control panel , arranged the various instrumentson a table before her where she could reach them with her right hand . Then he went to work on the attachment 's miniature dials to adjust them to the seven settings she 'd told him were needed . He swore suddenly , in a gust of savage impatience , asked without looking up , " How long have I been playingaround with this midget monster of yours ? " " Sixteen minutes , " Danestar told him . The paralysis had begun to lift ; she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face remained numb . But she still could n't force meaningful motion into her left hand . If she had been able to use it , she would n't have needed half a minute to flick in the dial readings , slap the attachment back into the detector . It was a job no more involved than threading a series of miniature needles . The problem was simply that Wergard 's hands were n't made for work on that scale , were n't trained to it . " Sixteen minutes ! " He groaned . His face was beaded with the sweat of effort . " Well , I seem to be getting the hang of it . Our luck may hold up . " It might , she thought . It was still a matter of luck . They 'd had good luck and bad luck both during the past half hour . Until now , the main alien body had been engaged in the cluster of activated defense barriers on the north side of the Depot . The viewscreen on the tablep152showed her the intermittent flickering of force fields there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And sometimes she 'd seen the great purple glow passing among the buildings . While it remained in that area , they had time left . But the barriers were being shut off , one by one . Detached work segments of the thing would be able to enter by a personnel lock and cut the controls . And  --  perhaps when the locks could not be immediately found  --  the main body was again driving directly through the force fields and absorbing what damage it must to get into a protected building . During the past four minutes alone , it appeared to have passed through three such sectional barriers . Changes in the detector 's visual pattern revealed the damage . The accumulated effect was not inconsiderable . Danestar 's gaze went to the locked instrument valise , lying on the table between the detector and the shortcode transmitter , in immediate reach of her right hand . Withinit was still the alien instrument she 'd taken from Dr. Hishkan 's office , the small , all-essential coordinating device without which the artificial asteroid from the cosmic cloud was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Had the alien mind discovered it would n't function , that the humans here had removed a section of it ? She thought it had . The repeated acceptance , during these last minutes , of the destruction of whole layers of its units in the raging force fields , to allow it to reach the barrier controls more quickly , suggested a new urgency in its search for human survivors . It would have been logical for it to assume that whoever had the missing instrument had sought refuge in the one area still shielded by multiple barriers . But when the last of those defense fields was shut off and the last of the northern buildings hunted through , the creature would turn here . In that , their luck had been bad  --  very bad ! To avoid attracting attention to thep153building , they 'd planned to leave its barrier off as long as possible . They were in sneaksuits , perhaps untraceable . They might have remained undetected indefinitely . But they had been in the barrier room only a few minutes before one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two sides of the building under observation , and nothing had been in sight there . Evidently , the thing had approached through an adjacent building . Without warning , it erupted from an upper corner of the room , swept down toward them . Danestar barely glimpsed it before Wergard scooped up the carbine placed across the table beside him and triggeredit one-handed . The segment vanished , as its counterparts in the building entry had done , in an exploding swirl of darting , purple-gleaming lines of light . The individual energy entities which had survived the gun 's shock-charge seemed as mindless and purposeless as an insect swarm whirled away on a sudden gust of wind . Danestar had slapped on the building 's defense fields almost as Wergardfired ; and in seconds , the indicators showed the fields flickering momentarily at thousands of points as the glittering purple threads flashed against them and were absorbed . Within a minute , the building was clear again . But almost immediately afterwards , the barrier was impacted in a far more solid manner ; and now the viewscreen showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the streets beside the building . Four or five segments had appeared together ; one had attempted to slip into the building and encountered the force field . Lacking the protective bulk of the main body , it was instantly destroyed . The others obviously had become aware of the danger . " If they can find the personnel lock here , they should try that ! " Wergard remarked . He laid Danestar 's instrument carefully to one side ,  |p154stood  waiting with the gun . The entry surface of the lock was in the wall across from them , ringed in warning light to show the field was active . Danestar kept her eyes on the control panel . After a moment , she said sharply , " They have found the lock ! " A yellow light had begun to flash beside the field indicators , signaling that the lock was in use . As it began to open on the room , the carbine flicked a charge into it , and the purple glow within exploded in glittering frenzies . The attempt to use the lock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves an immediate danger here . But in the open , away from the building , where they could bring their destructive powers into play , a few of them should be more than a match for the carbine . To retreat again to some other point of the Depot had become impossible . The things remained in the vicinity and were on guard , and other segments began to join them . That made it simply a question of how many minutes it still would be before the main body appeared to deal with the humans pinned down in this building . Neither Wergard nor Danestar mentioned it . They 'd had good luck and bad , lasted longer than there had been any real reason to expect ; now they 'd run out of alternative moves . Nothing was left to discuss . Wergard had laid the carbine down , resumed his carefully deliberate groping with the spidery dials of Danestar 's device . Danestar watched the instruments ; and the instruments , in their various ways , watched the enemy . A tic began working in the corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But his hands remained steady . After a time , he announced he had locked in the first setting . Then the second , and the third ... . There were developments in the instruments Danestar did n't tell him about . That the main body of the alienp155was absorbing savage punishment in its onslaught on the force fields became increasingly evident . The detector 's projection field pattern almost might have been that of a city undergoing an intermittent brutal barrage . Blackedoutsections remained lifeless now , and there were indicationsof an erratically spreading breakdown in general organization . But it should know , she thought , how much of that it could tolerate . Meanwhile it was achieving its purpose with frightening quickness . Barrier after barrier blazed in sudden bright fury along the line of search through the northern complex , subsided again . The viewscreen panels kept shifting as Danestar followed the thing 's progress . Then she cut in one more panel , and knew it was the last . The alien had very little farther to go . She switched the screen back momentarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building . I here was evidence here , she thought , in the steadily increasing number of ghostly darting light shapes beyond the barrier , that alien control of the Depot was almost complete . The segments had been sent through it like minor detachments of an invading army to make sure no humans were left in hiding anywhere . They were massing about this building now because the composite mind knew that within the building were the only survivorsoutside of the northern complex . The thing was intelligent by any standards , had used its resources methodically and calculatingly . The major section which had been detached from it after it captured the control building apparently had remained there throughout , taking no part in other action . That eliminatedthe possibility that humans might escape from the Depot or obtain outside help . Only during the past few minutes , after the alien mind was assured that the last survivors were pinned down , had there been a change in that part of the pattern in the projector field . The thingp156seemed to be on the move now , filling some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought , it would rejoin the main body as a reserve force , to make up for the losses suffered in the barriers . Or it might be on its way here . Wergard said absently , as if it had occurred to him to mention in passing something that was of no great interest to either of them , " Got that fourth setting now .... " Less than a minute later , in the same flat , perfunctory tone , he announced the fifth setting was locked in ; and hope flared in Danestar so suddenly it was like a shock of hot fright . She glanced quickly at him . Staring down at the instrumenthe fingered with infinite two-handed deliberation , Wergard looked drugged , in a white-faced trance . She did n't dare address him , do anything that might break into that complete absorption . But mentally she found herself screaming at him to hurry . There was so little time left . The last barrier in the northern complex had flared , gone dead , minutes before . The giant main body of the alien @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the scintillating signal swarms in the projector , and briefly Danestar had thought that the last tearing shock of force field energies could have left the great mass finally disorganized , crippled and stunned . But then evidence grew that the component which had remained in the control station was , in fact , rejoiningthe main body . And its role became clear . As the two merged , the erratic disturbances in the major section dimmed , smoothed out .. A suggestion of swift , multitudinousrhythms coordinating the whole gradually returned . The Pit thing was the equivalent of an army of billions of individuals . And that entity had a directing intelligence  --  centeredin the section which had held itself out of action until the energy defenses of the Depot werep157neutralized . Now it had reappeared , unaffected by the damage the main body had suffered , to resume control , restore order . Quantitatively , the composite monster was reduced , shrunken . But its efficiency remained unimpaired ; and as far as she and Wergard were concerned , the loss in sheer mass made no difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd kept the panels of the viewscreen shifting about along the line of approach it should take between the northern complex and this building . She did not catch sight of it . But , of course , if it was in motion again , it could as easily be flowing toward them below ground level where the screen would n't show it ... . Danestar paused , right hand on the screen mechanism . Had there been the lightest , most momentary , betrayingquiver in a section of the defense barrier indicators just then ? The screen was turned to the area about the building ; and only the swift gliding ghost shapes of the segments were visible in the streets outside . But that meant nothing . She kept her eyes on the b , irrier panel . Seconds passed ; then a brief quivering ran through the indicators and subsided . ' I he thing was here , beneath the building , barely beyond range of its force field . Danestar drew the instrument valise quietly toward her , opened its dial lock and took out the ovoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside it . She laid the device on the table , placed the gun 's muzzle against it . A slight pull of her trigger finger would drive a shattering charge into the instrument . . . . Iler eyes went back to the viewscreen . The swirling mass of light shapes out there abruptly had stopped to oving . She and Wergard had discussed this . The alien had traced the U-League 's asteroid specimen from the Pit to Mermiali , and to the Depot . While the instrument nowp158missing from the specimen had been enclosed by the spyproof screens of Danestar 's valise , the alien 's senses evidently had not detected it . But it should register on them as soon as it was removed again from the valise . One question had been then whether the alien would be aware of the device 's importance to it . Danestar thought now that it was . The other question was whether it had learned enough from its contacts with humans to realize that , cornered and facing death , they might destroy such an instrument to keep it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it might , in the final situation , gain them a little more time . She would not have been surprised if the barrier indicators had blazed red the instant after she opened the valise . And she would , in that moment , which certainly must be the last of her life and Wergard 's , have pulled the gun trigger . But nothing happened immediately , except that the segments in the streets outside the building went motionless . That , of course , should have some significance . Danestar waited now as motionlessly . Perhaps half a minute passed . Then the rattling pickup signal of the shortcode transmitter on the table suddenly jarred the stillness of the room . Some seconds later , three spaced words , stolen from living human voices , patched together by the alien 's cunning , came from the transmitter : " I . . . want . . . it .... " There was a pause . On Danestar 's left , Wergard made a harsh laughing sound . She watched the barrier panel . The indicators there remained quiet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . " repeated the transmitter suddenly . It paused again . " Six , Danestar ! " Wergard 's voice told her . He added something in a mutter , went silent . " I ... wantp159The transmitter cut off abruptly . The force field indicatorsflickered very slightly and then were still . But in the viewscreen there was renewed motion . The segments in the street to the left of the building lifted like burning leaves caught by the breath of an approaching storm , swirled up together , streamed into and across the building beyond . In an instant , the street was empty of them . In the street on the right , ghostly lire shapes also were moving off , more slowly , gliding away to the east , while the others began pouring out of building fronts and down through the air again to join the withdrawal . Some four hundred yards away , the swarm came to a stop , massing together . Seconds later , the paving about them showed the familiar purple glitter and the gleaming mass of the Pit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emissaries merginginto it and vanishing as it arose . It lay there quietly then , filling the width of the street . I he situation had been presented in a manner which could not be misunderstood . The alien mind wanted the instrument . It knew the humans in this building had it . It had communicated the fact to them , then drawn back from the building , drawn its segments with it . The humans , it implied , were free to go now , leaving the instrument behind ... . But , of course , that was not the real situation . There was no possible compromise . The insignificant-looking device against which Danestar 's gun was held was the key to the Pit . To abandon it to the alien at this final moment was out of the question . And the act , in any case , would not have extended their lives by more than a few minutes . So the muzzle of the gun remained where it was , and Danestar made no other move . Revealing they had here what the creature wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she heard Wergard tell her he kid locked in the seventh and final setting on thep160diabolically tiny instrument with which he had been struggling for almost twenty minutes , she could do nothing else . But Wergard stayed silent while the seconds slipped away . When some two minutes had passed , Danestar realized the giant fire shape was settling back beneath the surface of the street . Within seconds then it disappeared . A leaden hopelessness settled on her at last . When they saw the thing again , it would be coming in for the final attack . And if it rose against the force fields from below the building , they would not see it then . She must remember to pull the trigger the instant the barrier indicators flashed their warning . Then it would be over . She looked around at Wergard , saw he had placed the instrument on the table before him and was scowling down at it , lost in the black abstraction that somehow had enabled his fingers to do what normally must have been impossible to them . Only a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completed it . She parted her lips to warn him of what was about to happen , then shook her head silently . Why disturb him now ? There was nothing more Wergard could do , either . As she looked back at the viewscreen , the Pit creature began to rise through the street level a hundred yards away . It lifted smoothly , monstrously , a flowing mountain of purple brilliance , poured toward them . Seconds left . . . . Her finger went taut on the trigger . A bemused , slow voice seemed to say heavily , " My eyes keep blurring now . Want to check this , Danestar ? I think I have the setting , but " No time ! " She screamed it out , as the gun dropped to the table . She twisted awkwardly around on the chair , right hand reaching . " Let me have it ! " Then Wergard , shocked free of whatever trance had closed on him , was there , slapping the device into herp161hand , steadying her as she twisted back toward the detectorand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Danestar locked the attachment down , glanced over her shoulder , saw him standing again at the other table , eyes fixed on her , hand lifted above the plunger of the power pack beside the carbine . " Now ! " she whispered . Wergard could n't possibly have heard it . But his palm came down in a hard slap on the plunger as the indicatorsof the entire eastern section of the barrier flared red . Danestar was a girl who preferred subtle methods in her work when possible . She had designed the detector 's interference attachment primarily to permit careful , unnoticeable manipulations of messages passing over supposedly untappable communication lines ; and it worked very well for that purpose . On this occasion , however , with the peak thrust of the power pack surging into it , there was nothing subtle about its action . A storm of static howled through the Depot along the Pit creature 's internal communication hand . In reaction to it , the composite body quite literally shattered . The viewscreen filled with boiling geysers of purple light . Under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rising mass expanded into a writhing , glowingcloud . Ripped by continuing torrents of static , it faded further , dissipated into billions of flashing lines of light , mindlessly seeking escape . In their billions , they poured upon the defense globe of the ancient fortress . For three or four minutes , the great barrier drank them in greedily. hen the U-League Depot stood quiet again.  |p162THE  WINDS OF TIMEEFTY RAMMER came along the narrow passagesGbetween the Silver Queen 's control compartment and the staterooms , trying to exchange the haggard look on his face for one of competent self-assurance . There was nothing to gain by letting his two passengers suspectthat during the past few minutes , their pilot , the owner of Rammer Spacelines , had been a bare step away from plain and fancy gibbering . He opened the door to Mr. Maulbow 's stateroom and went inside . Mr. Maulbow , face very pale , eyes closed , lay on his back on the couch , still unconscious . He'dbeen knocked out when some unknown forces suddenly started batting the Silver Queen 's turnip shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eighteenyears of spacefaring . Kerim Ruse , Maulbow 's secretary , knelt beside her employer , checking his pulse . Aside from Gefty himself , these were the only people aboard . The Queen was automated ; once she 'd been loaded and had taken on passengers , he needed no help in operating her until she was back in dock again . Kerim lookedanxiously around at him.  | " What did you find out ? " she asked in a voice that was not very steady . Gefty shrugged . " Nothing definite as yet . The ship has n't been damaged  --  she 's a tough tub . That 's one good point . Otherwise . . . well , I climbed into a suit and took a look out the escape hatch . And I saw the same thing there that the screens show . Whatever that is . " " You 've no idea then of what 's happened to us , or where we are ? " Miss Ruse persisted . She was a rather small girl with large , beautiful gray eyes and thick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a sleeping outfit which consisted of something soft wrapped around her top , soft and floppy trousers below . I he black hair was tousled and she looked around fifteen . She 'd been asleep in her stateroom when somethingsmacked the Queen , and she was sensible enough then not to climb out of the bunk 's safety field until the ship finally stopped shuddering and bucking about . That made her the only one of the three persons aboard who had collected no bruises . She was scared , of course , but taking the situation very well . Gefty said carefully , " There 're a number of possibilities . It 's obvious that the Queen has been knocked out of normspace , and it may take some time to find out how to get her back there . But the main thing is that the ship 's intact . So far , it does n't look too bad . " Miss Ruse seemed somewhat reassured . Gefty could hardly have said the same for himself . He was a qualified normspace and subspace pilot . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the past eight years he 'd been ferrying his own two ships about the Hub and not infrequently beyond the Federation 's space territories , but he had never heard of a situation like this . What he saw in the viewscreens when the ship steadied enough to let him pick himself off the instrument floor , and again , a few minutes later and with much more immediacy ,  | from the escape hatch , made no sense  --  seemed simplyto have no meaning . The pressure meters said there wasa vacuum outside the Queen 's skin . That vacuum was pitch-black , but here and there came momentary suggestions of vague light and color . Occasional pinpricksof brightness showed and were gone . And there had been one startling phenomenon like a distant giant explosion , a sudden pallid glare in the dark , whichappeared far ahead of the Queen and , for the instant it remained in sight , seemed to be rushing directly toward them . It had given Gefty the feeling that the ship itself was plowing at high speed through this eerie medium . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idling pulse as soon as he staggered back to the control console and got his first look at the screens , so it must have been the light that had moved . But such details were best not discussed with a passenger . Kerim Ruse would be arriving at enough disquietingspeculations on her own ; the less he told her , the better . There was the matter of the ship 's location instruments . The only set Gefty had been able to obtain any reading on were the direction indicators . And what they appeared to indicate was that the Silver Queen was turning on a new heading something like twenty times a second . Gefty asked , " Has Mr. Maulbow shown any signs of waking up ? " Kerim shook her head . " His breathing and pulse seem all right , and that bump on his head does n't look really bad , but he has n't moved at all . Can you think of anything else we might do for him , Gefty ? " " Not at the moment , " Gefty said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how he feels when he comes out of it . " He was wondering about Mr. Maulbow and the fact that this charter had showed some unusual features from the beginning . Kerim was a friendly sort of girl ; they 'd got to calling each other by their first names within ap165day or two after the trip started . But after that , she seemed to be avoiding him ; and Gefty guessed that Maulbow had spoken to her , probably to make sure that Kerim did n't let any of her employer 's secrets slip out . Maulbow himself was as aloof and taciturn a client as Rammer Spacelines ever had picked up . A lean , blond character of indeterminate age , with pale eyes , hard mouth . Why he had selected a bulky semifreighter like the Queen for a mineralogical survey jaunt to a lifeless little sun system far beyond the outposts of civilization was a point he did n't discuss . Gefty , needing the charter money , had restrained his curiosity . If Maulbow wanted only a pilot and preferred to do all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's affair . And if he happened to be up to something illegal  --  though it was difficult to imagine what  --  Customs would nail him when they got back to the Hub . But those facts looked a little different now . Gefty scratched his chin , inquired , " Do you happen to know where Mr. Maulbow keeps the keys to the storage vault ? " Kerim looked startled . " Why , no ! I could n't permit you to take the keys anyway while he . . . while he 's unconscious . You know that . " Gefty grunted . " Any idea of what he has locked up in the vault ? " " You should n't ask me . . . . " Her eyes widened . " Why , that could n't possibly have anything to do with what 's happened ! " He might , Gefty thought , have reassured her a little too much . He said , " I would n't know . But I do n't want to just sit here and wonder about it until Maulbow wakes up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better not miss any bets . Because one thing 's sure  --  if this has happened to anybody else , they did n't turn up again to report it . You see ? " Kerim apparently did . She went pale , then saidp166hesitantly , " Well  --  the sealed cases Mr. Maulbow brought out from the Hub with him had some expensive instruments in them . That 's all I know . He 's always trusted me not to pry into his business any more than my secretarial duties required , and of course I have n't . " " You do n't know then what it was he brought up from that moon a few hours ago  --  those two big cases he stowed away in the vault ? " " No , I do n't , Gefty . You see , he has n't told me what the purpose of this trip is . I only know that it 's a matter of great importance to him . " Kerim paused , added , " From the careful manner Mr. Maulbow handled the cases with the cranes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be quite heavy . " " I noticed that , " Gefty said . It was n't much help . " Well , I 'll tell you something now , " he went on . " I let your boss keep both sets of keys to the storage vault because he insisted on it when he signed the charter . What I did n't tell him was that I could make up a duplicate set any time in around half an hour . " " Oh ! Have you " Not yet . But I intend to take a look at what Mr. Maulbow 's got in that vault now , with or without his consent . You 'd better run along and get dressed while I take him up to the instrument room . " " Why move him ? " Kerim asked . " The instrument room 's got an over-all safety field . I 've turned it on now , and if something starts banging us around again , the room will be the safest place on the ship . I 'll bring his personal luggage up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the keys . You may find them before I get a new set made . Or he may wake up and tell us where they are . " Kerim Ruse gave her employer a dubious glance , then nodded , said , " I imagine you 're right , Gefty , " and patteredhurriedly out of the stateroom . A few minutes later ,  |p167she  arrived , fully dressed , in the instrument room . Gefty looked around from the table-shelf where he had laid out his tools , and said , " He has n't stirred . His suitcases are over there . I 've unlocked them . " Kerim gazed at what showed in the screens about the control console and shivered slightly . She said , " I was thinking , Gefty . . . is n't there something they call Space Three ? " " Sure . Pseudospace . But that is n't where we are . There 're some special-built Navy tubs that can operate in that stuff if they do n't stay too long . A ship like the Queen . well , you and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by now if we 'd got sucked somehowinto Space Three . " " I see , " Kerim said uncomfortably . Gefty heard her move over to the suitcases . After a moment , she asked , " What do the vault keys look like ? " " You ca n't miss them if he 's just stuck them in there somewhere . They 're over six inches long . What kind of guy is this Maulbow ? A scientist ? " " I could n't say , Gefty . He 's never referred to himself as a scientist . I 've had this job a year and a half . Mr. Maulbow is a very considerate employer . . . one of the nicest men I 've known , really . But it was simply understood that I should ask no questions about the business beyond what I actually needed to know for my work . " " What 's the business called ? " " Maulbow Engineering . " " Big help , " Gefty observed , somewhat sourly . " Those instruments he brought along . . . he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think he designed some of them  --  probablymost of them . The companies he had doing the actual work appeared to have a terrible time getting everything exactly the way Mr. Maulbow wanted it . . . . There 's nothing that looks like a set of keys in those first two suitcases , Gefty. "  | " Well , " Gefty said , " if you do n't find them in the others , you might start thumping around to see if he 's got secret compartments in his luggage somewhere . " " I do wish , " Kerim Ruse said uneasily , " that Mr. Maulbowwould regain consciousness . It seems so . . . so underhandedto be doing these things behind his back ! " Gefty grunted noncommittally . He was n't at all certainby now that he wanted his secretive client to wake up before he 'd checked on the contents of the Queen 's storage vault . Fifteen minutes later , Gefty Rammer was climbing down to the storage deck in the Queen 's broad stern , the newly fashioned set of vault keys clanking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her employer who was getting back his color but still had n't opened his eyes . She had n't found the original keys . Gefty was n't sure she 'd tried too hard , though she seemed to realize the seriousness of the situation now . But her loyalty to Mr. Maulbow could make no further difference , and she probably felt more comfortable for it . Lights went on automatically in the wide passage leading from the cargo lock to the vault as Gefty turned into it . His steps echoed between the steel bulkheads on either side . He paused a moment before the big circular vault doors , listening to the purr of the Queen 's idling engines in the next compartment . The familiar sound was somehow reassuring . He inserted the first key , turned it over twice , drew it out again and pressed one of the buttons in the control panel beside the door . The heavy slab of steel moved sideways with a soft hissing sound , vanished into the wall . Gefty slid the other key into the lock of the inner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay open before him . He stood still again , wrinkling his nose . The area ahead was only dimly illuminated  --  the shaking-up thep169Queen had undergone had disturbed the lighting system here . And what was that odor ? Rather sharp , unpleasant ; it might have been spilled ammonia . Gefty stepped through the door into the wide short entrance passage beyond it , turned to the right and peered about in the semidarkness of the vault . Two great steel cases  --  the ones Maulbow had taken down to an airless moon surface , loaded up with somethingand brought back to the Queen  --  were jammed awkwardly into a corner ; their position suggested they 'd slid there when the ship was being knocked around . One of them was open and appeared to be empty . Gefty was n't sure of the other . In the dimness beside them lay the coils of some very thick dark cable . And standing near the center of the floor was a thing that at once riveted his attention on it completely . He sucked his breath in softly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own hunch . But , of course , if it had n't been an unheard-of outside force that plucked the Queen out of normspace and threw her into this elsewhere , then it must be something Maulbow had put on board . And that something had to be a machine of some kind ... . It was . About it he could make out a thin gleaming of wires  --  a jury-rigged safety field . Within the flimsy-looking protective cage was a double bank of instruments , some of them alive with the flicker and glow of lights . Those must be the difficult-to-build and expensive items Maulbow had brought out from the Hub . Beside them stood the machine , squat and ponderous . In the vague light it looked misshapen and discolored . A piece of equipment that had taken a bad beating of some kind . But it was functioning . As he stared , intermittent bursts of clicking noises rose from it , like the staccato of distant irregular gunfire.  |p170For  a moment , questions raced in disorder through his mind . What was it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another ship , wrecked now . . . a ship that had been at home here ? Was it some sort of drive ? Maulbow must know . He 'd known enough to design the instruments required to bring the battered monster back to life . On the other hand , he had not foreseen in all detail what could happen once the thing was in operation , because the Queen 's sudden buck-jumping act had surprised him and knocked him out . The first step , in any event , was to get Maulbow awake now . To tamper with a device like this , before learning as much as one could about it , would be foolhardiness . It looked like too good a bet that the next serious mistakemade by anybody would finish them all . Perhaps it was only because Gefty 's nerves were on edge that he grew aware at that point of his reflections of two minor signals from his senses . One was that the smell of ammonia , which he had almost stopped noticing , was becoming appreciably stronger . The other was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind him . But here in the storage vault nothing should have moved , and Gefty 's muscles were tensing as his head came around . Almost in the same instant , he flung himself wildly to one side , stumbling and regaining his balance as something big and dark slapped heavily down on the floor at the point where he had stood . Then he was darting up through the entrance passage , turning , and knocking down the lock switches on the outside door panel . It came flowing around the corner of the passage behind him as the vault doors began to slide together . He was aware mainly of swift smooth oily motion like that of a big snake ; then , for a fraction of a second , a strip of brighter light from the outside passage showed a long heavy wedge of a head , a green metal-glint of staring eyes.  |p171The  doors closed silently into their frames and locked . The thing was inside . But it was almost a minute then before Gefty could control his shaking legs long enough to start moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vault , it had looked like a big coiled cable lying next to the packing cases . It might have been batteredaround and knocked out during the recent disturbance ; and when it recovered , it had found Gefty in the vault with it . But it might also have been awake all the while , waiting cunningly until Gefty 's attention seemed fixed elsewhere before launching its attack . It was big enough to have flattened him and smashed every bone in his body if the stroke had landed . Some kind of guard animal  --  a snakelike watchdog ? What other connection could it have with the mystery machine ? Perhaps Maulbow had intended to leave it confined in one of the cases , and it had broken loose ... . Too many questions by now , Gefty thought . But Maulbow had the answers . He was hurrying up the main deck 's central passage when Maulbow 's voice addressed him sharply from a door he 'd just passed . " Stop right there , Rammer ! Do n't dare to move ! The voice ended on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rational , but it was prompt . Maulbow 's tone and phrasing implied he was armed . Gefty was n't , but he kept a gun in the instrument room for emergencies . He 'd been through a whole series of unnerving experiences , winding up with being shagged out of his storage vault by something that stank of ammoniaand looked like a giant snake . To have one of the Queen 's passengers order him to stand where he was topped it off . Every other consideration was swept aside by a great urge to get his hands on his gun . He glanced back , saw Maulbow stepping out of thep172half-opened door , something like a twenty-inch thin white rod in one hand . Then Gefty went bounding on along the passage , bent forward and zigzagging from wall to wall to give Maulbow  --  if the thing he held was a weapon and he actually intended to use it  --  as difficult a target as possible . Maulbow shouted angrily behind him . Then , as Gefty came up to a cross-passage , a line of white fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the passage wall . With that , he was around the corner , and boiling mad . He had no great liking for gunfire , but it did n't shake him like the silently attacking beast in the dark vault had done . He reached the deserted instrument room not many seconds later , had his gun out and cocked , and was faced back toward the passage by which he had entered . Maulbow , if he had pursued without hesitation , should be arriving by now . But the passage stayed quiet . Gefty could n't see into it from where he stood . He waited , trying to steady his breathing , wondering where Kerim Ruse was and what had got into Maulbow . After a moment , without taking his eyes from the passage entrance , he reached into the wall closet from which he had taken the gun and fished out another souvenir of his active service days , a thinbladedknife in a slip-sheath . Gefty worked the fasteningsof the sheath over his left wrist and up his forearm under his coat , tested the release @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coat sleeve back into place . The passage was still quiet . Gefty moved softly over to one of the chairs , took a small cushion from it and pitched it out in front of the entrance . There was a hiss . The cushion turned in midair into a puff of bright white fire . Gefty aimed his gun high at the far passage wall just beyond the entrance and pulled the trigger . It was a projectile gun . He heard the slug screech off the slick plastic bulkhead and go slammingp173down the passage . Somebody out there made a startled , incoherent noise . But not the kind of noise a man makes when he 's just been hit . " If you come in here armed , " Gefty called , " I 'll blow your head off . Want to stop this nonsense now ? " There was a moment 's silence . Then Maulbow 's voice replied shakily from the passage . He seemed to be standing about twenty feet back from the room . " If you 'll end your thoughtless attempts at interference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be no trouble . " He was speaking with the restraint of a man who is in a state of cold fury . " You 're endangering us all ! You must realize that you have no understanding of what you are doing . " Well , the last could be true enough . " We 'll talk about it , " Gefty said without friendliness . " I have n't done anythingyet , but I 'm not just handing the ship over to you . And what have you done with Miss Ruse ? " Maulbow hestitated again . " She 's in the map room , " he said then . " I . . . it was necessary to restrict her movementsfor a while . But you might as well let her out now . We must reach an agreement without loss of time . " Gefty glanced over his shoulder at the small closed door of the map room . There was no lock on the door , and he had heard no sound from inside ; this might be a trick . But it would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wall , pushed the door open and looked inside . Kerim was there , sitting on a chair in one corner of the tiny room . The reason she had n't made any noise became clear . She and the chair were covered by a rather closely fitting sack of glistening transparent fabric . She stared out through it despairingly at Gefty , her lips moving urgently . But no sound came from the sack . Gefty called angrily , " Maulbow " Do n't excite yourself , Rammer . " There was a sug- gestion of what might be contempt in Maulbow 's tone now . " The girl has n't been harmed . She can breathe easily through the restrainer . And you can remove it from her very simply by pulling at the material from outside . " Gefty 's mouth tightened . " I 'll keep my gun on the passage while I do it . " Maulbow did n't answer . Gefty edged back into the map room , tentatively grasped the transparent stuff above Kerim 's shoulder . To his surprise , it parted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment Kerim came peeling herself out of it , her face tear-stained , working desperately with hands , elbows , and shoulders . " Gefty , " she gasped , " he . . . Mr. Maulbow " He 's out in the passage there , " Gefty said . " He can hear you . " His glance shifted for an instant to the wall where a second of the shroudlike transparencies was hanging . And who could that have been intended for , he thought , but Gefty Rammer ? He added , " We 've had a little trouble . " " Oh ! " She looked out of the room toward the passage , then at the gun in Gefty 's hand , then up at his face . " Maulbow , " Gefty went on , speaking distinctly enough to make sure Maulbow heard , " has a gun , too . He 'll stay there in the passage and we 'll stay in the instrumentroom until we agree on what should be done . He 's responsible for what 's happened , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at Kerim 's frightened eyes , lowered his voice to a whisper . " Do n't let this worry you too much . I have n't found out just what he 's up to , but so far his tricks have pretty much backfired . He was counting on taking us both by surprise , for one thing . That did n't work so now he 'd like us to cooperate . " " Are you going to ? "  |p175Gefty  shrugged . " Depends on what he has in mind . I 'm just interested in getting us out of this alive . Let 's hear what Maulbow has to say . " Some minutes later , Gefty was trying to decide whether it was taking a worse risk to believe what Maulbow said than to keep things stalled because of the probability that he was lying . Kerim Ruse , perched stiffly erect on the edge of a chair , eyes big and round , face almost colorless , apparentlybelieved Maulbow and was wishing she did n't . There was , of course , some supporting evidence  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire spouter and the sleazy-looking " restrainer " had a sufficiently unfamiliarair to go with Maulbow 's story ; but so far as Gefty knew , either of them could have been manufacturedin the Hub . Then there was the janandra  --  the big snakish thing in the storage vault , which Maulbow had brought back up from the moon along with the battered machine . It had been , he said , his shipboard companion on another voyage . It was n't ordinarily aggressive  --  Gefty 's suddenappearance in the vault must have startled it into making an attack . It was not exactly a pet . There was a psychological relationship between it and Maulbow which Maulbow would not attempt to explain because Gefty and Kerim would be unable to grasp its significance . The janandra was essential , in this unexplained manner , to his well-being . That item was almost curious enough to seem to substantiate his other statements , but it did n't really prove anything . The only point Gefty did n't question in the least was that they were in a bad spot which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the screens . What he saw out there , surrounding the ship ,  | was , according to Maulbow , an illusion of space created by the time flow in which they were moving . According to Maulbow , there was a race of the future , human in appearance , with machines to sail the current of time through the universe  --  to run and tack with the winds of time , dipping in and out of the normspace of distant periods and galaxies as they chose . Maulbow , one of the explorers , had met disaster a million light-years from the home of his kind , centuries behind them , his vehicle wrecked on an airless moon with damaged control unit and shattered instruments . He had made his way to a human civilization to obtain the equipment he needed , and returned at last with the Silver Queen to where the time-sailer lay buried . Gefty 's lip curled . No , he was n't buying all that just yet . . . but if Maulbow was not lying , then the unseen stars were racing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by , eventually to be lost forever beyond a black distance no spacedrive could span . The matter simply had to be settled quickly . But Maulbow was also strained and impatient , and if his impatience could be increased a little more , he might start telling the things that really mattered , the things Gefty had to know . Gefty asked slowly , as if hesitant to commit himself , " Why did you bring us along ? " The voice from the passage snapped , " Because my resources were nearly exhausted , Rammer ! I could n't obtain a new ship . Therefore I chartered yours ; and you came with it . As for Miss Ruse  --  in spite of every precaution , my activities have aroused curiosity and suspicion among your people . When I disappeared , Miss Ruse might have been questioned . I could n't risk being followed to the wreck of the sailer , so I took her with me . What does that mean against what I have offered you ? The greatest adventure  --  followed , I give you my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place andp177time , and the most generous compensation for any inconvenience you may have suffered ! " Kerim , looking up at Gefty , shook her head violently . Gefty said , " We find it difficult to take you on trust now , Maulbow . Why do you want to get into the instrument room ? " Maulbow was silent for some seconds . Then he said , As I told you , this ship would not have been buffeted about during the moments of transfer if the control unit were operating with complete efficiency . Certain adjustmentswill have to be made in the unit , and this should he done promptly . " " Where do the ship instruments come in ? " Gefty asked . " I can determine the nature of the problem from them . When I was . . . stranded . . . the unit was seriously damaged . My recent repairs were necessarilyhasty . I " What caused the crack-up ? " Maulbow said , tone taut with impatience , " Certain sections of the Great Current are infested with dangerous forces . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would n't get it ? " " I do n't pretend to understand them very well myself , hammer . They are not life but show characteristics of life  --  even of intelligence . If you can imagine radiant energy being capable of conscious hostility .... " There was a chill at the back of Gefty 's neck . " A big fast-moving light ? " " Yes ! " Sharp concern showed suddenly in the voice from the passage . " You ... when did you see that ? " Gefty glanced at the screens . " Twice since you 've been talking . And once before  --  immediately after we got tumbled around . " " Then we can waste no more time , Rammer ! If those f o rces were close enough to be seen , they 're aware thep178ship is here . They are sensitive to the fluctuation of the control unit . They were attempting to locate it . " " What could they do ' ? " Maulbow said , " A single attack was enough to put the control unit out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us instantly . A ship of this size might afford more protection , which is the reason I chose it . But if the control unit is not adjusted immediately to enable it to take us out of this section , the attacks will continue until the ship  --  and we  --  have been destroyed . " Gefty drew a deep breath . " There 's another solution to that problem . Miss Ruse and I prefer it . And if you meant what you said  --  that you 'd see to it we got back eventually  --  you should n't object , either . " The voice asked sharply , " What do you mean ? " Gefty said , " Shut the control unit off . From what you were saying , that throws us automatically back into normspace , while we 're still close enough to the Hub . You 'll find plenty of people there who 'll stake you to a trip to the future if they can go along and are convinced they 'll return . Miss Ruse and I do n't happen to be that adventurous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added , " Take your time to make up your mind about it , if you want to . I do n't like the idea of those lights hitting us , but neither do you . And I think I can wait this out as well as you can . " The silence stretched out . Presently Gefty said , " If you do accept , slide that fire-shooting device of yours into the room before you show up . We do n't want accidents . " He paused again . Kerim was chewing her lip , hands clenched into small fists in her lap . Then Maulbow answered , voice flat and expressionless now . " The worst thing we can do at present , " he said , " isp179toy prolong a dispute about possible courses of action . I f I disarm , will you lay aside your gun ? " " Yes . " " Then I accept your conditions , disappointing as they are . He was silent . After a moment , Gefty heard the white rod clatter lightly along the floor of the passage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and rolled into the instrumentroom , coming to rest a few feet away from him . Gefty hesitated , picked it up and laid it on the shelf table . He placed his own gun beside it , moved a dozen steps away . Kerim 's eyes followed him anxiously . " Gefty , " she whispered , " he might . . . " Gefty looked at her , formed the words " It 's all right " with his mouth and called , " Guns have been put aside , Maulbow . Come on in , and let 's keep it peaceable . " He waited , arms hanging loosely at his sides , heart heating heavily , as quick footsteps came up the passage . Maulbow appeared in the entrance , glanced at Gefty and Kerim , then about the room . His gaze rested for a moment on the shelf table , shifted back to Gefty . Maulbow came on into the room , turning toward Gefty , mouth twisting . He said softly , " It is not our practice , Rammer , to share the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't foreseen that you might become a dangerous nuisance . But now ... " His right hand began to lift , half closed about some small golden instrument . Gefty 's left arm moved back and quickly forward . The service knife slid out of its sheath and up from his palm as an arrow of smoky blackness burst from the tiling in Maulbow 's hand . The blackness came racing with a thin snarling noise across the floor toward Gefty 's feet . The knife flashed across it , turning , and stood hiltdeepin Maulbow 's chest.  |p180Gefty  returned a few minutes later from the forward cabin which served as the Queen 's sick bay , and said to Kerim , " He 's still alive , though I do n't know why . He may even recover . He 's full of anesthetic , and that should keep him quiet until we 're back in normspace . Then I 'll see what we can do for him . " Kerim has lost some of her white shocked look while he was gone . " You knew he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Suspected he had it in mind ; he gave in too quick . But I thought I 'd have a chance to take any gadget he was hiding away from him first . I was wrong about that . Now we 'd better move fast ! " He switched the emergency check panel back on , glanced over the familiar pattern of lights and numbers . A few minor damage spots were indicated , but the ship was still fully operational . One minor damage spot which did not appear on the panel was now to be found in the instrument room itself , in the corner on which the door of the map room opened . The door , the adjoining bulkheadsand section of flooring were scarred , blackened , and as malodorous as burned things tend to become . That was where Gefty had stood when Maulbow entered the room ; and if he had remained there an instant after letting go of the knife , he would have been in very much worse condition than the essentially fireproof furnishings . Both Maulbow 's weapons  --  the white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ device which had dropped from his hand , spitting darts of smoking blackness  --  had blasted unnervingly away into that area for almost thirty seconds after Maulbow was down and twisting about on the floor . Then he went limp ; the firing instantly stopped . Apparently Maulbow 's control of them ended as he lost consciousness . It seemed fortunate that the sick bay 's emergency treatment accessories , gentle as their action was , mightp181have been designed for the purpose of keeping the most violent of prisoners immobilized  --  let alone one with a terrible knife wound in him . At the angle along which the knife had driven in and up below the ribs , an ordinaryman should have been dead in seconds . But it was very evident now that Maulbow was no ordinary man , and even after his eerie weapons had been pitched out of the ship through the instrument room 's disposal tube , Gefty could n't rid himself of an uncomfortable suspicion that he was n't done with Maulbow  --  would n't be done with him , in fact , until one or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kerim , " I thought the machine Maulbow set up in the storage vault would turn out to be some hind of drive engine , but apparently it has an entirely different function . He connected it with the instruments he had made in the Hub , and together they form what he calls a control unit . The emergency panel would show it if the unit were drawing juice from the ship . It is n't , and I do n't know what powers it . But we do know now that the unit is holding us in the time current , and it will go on holding us there as long as it 's in operation . " If we could shut it off , the Queen would be rejected ' by the current , like Maulbow 's sailer was . In other words , we 'd get knocked back into normspace  --  which is what we want . And we want it to happen as soon as possible because , if Maulbow was telling the truth about that , every minute that passes is taking us farther from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Kerim nodded , eyes intent on his face . " Now , I ca n't just go down there and start slapping switches around on the thing , " Gefty went on . " He said it was n't working right , and even if it were , I could n't tell what would happen . But it does n't seem to connect up with any ship systems  --  it just seems to be holding us in a field of its own . So I should be able to move the wholep182unit into the cargo lock and eject it from there . If we shift the Queen outside its field , that should have the same effect as shutting the control unit off . It should throw us back into normspace . " Kerim nodded again . " What about Mr. Maulbow 's janandra animal ? " Gefty shrugged . " Depends on the mood I find it in . He said it was n't usually aggressive . Maybe it is n't . I 'll get into a spacesuit for protection and break out some of the mining equipment to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an empty compartment where it will be out of the  --  " He broke off , expression changing , eyes fastened on the emergency panel . Then he turned hurriedly , reached across the console for the intership airseal controls . Kerim asked apprehensively , " What 's the matter , Gefty ? " " Wish I knew . . . exactly . " Gefty indicated the emergency panel . " Little red light there , on the storage deck section  --  it was n't showing a minute ago . It means that the vault doors have been opened since then . " He saw the same half-superstitious fear appear in her face that had touched him . " You think he did it ? " " I do n't know . " Maulbow 's control of the guns had seemed uncanny enough . But that was a different matter . The guns were a product of his own time and science . But the vault door mechanisms ? There might have been sufficient opportunity for Maulbow to study and alter them , for some purpose of his own , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship compartments and decks sealed off from each other now , " Gefty said slowly . " The only connecting points from one to the other are personnel hatches . They 're small airlocks . So the janandra 's confined to the storage deck . If it 's come out of the vault , it might be a nuisance until I can get equipment to handle it . But that is n't too serious . The spacesuits arep183on the second deck , and I 'll get into one before I go on to the storage . If you 'll wait here a moment , I 'll look in on Maulbow again before I start . " If Maulbow was n't still unconscious , he was doing a good job of feigning it . Gefty looked at the lax , pale face , the half-shut eyes , shook his head and left the cabin , locking it behind him . It might n't be Maulbow 's doing , but having the big snake loose in the storage could , in fact , make things extremely awkward now . He suspected his gun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that size , and while several of the ship 's mining tools could be employed as very effective closerangeweapons , they happened , unfortunately , to be stored away on the same deck . He found Kerim standing in the center of the instrumentroom , waiting for him . " Gefty , " she said , " do you notice anything ? An odd sort of smell ? " Then the odor was in Gefty 's nostrils , too , and the hack of his neck turned to ice as he recognized it . He glanced up at the ventilation outlet , looked back at Kerim . He took her arm , said softly , " Come this way . Keep very quiet ! I do n't know how it happened , but the janandra'son the main deck now ! That 's what it smells like . The smell 's coming through the ventilation system , so the thing 's moving around in the port section . We 'll go the other way . " Kerim whispered , " What will we do ? " " Get ourselves into spacesuits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ship . The janandra seems to be looking around for him . If it is , it wo n't bother us . " He had n't wanted to remind Kerim that , from what Maulbow had said , there might be more than one reason for getting rid of the control unit as quickly as possible.  |p184But  it had been constantly in the back of his mind ; and twice , in the few minutes that had passed after Maulbow'sstrange weapons were silenced , he had seen a momentary pale glare appear in the unquiet flow of darkness reflected in the viewscreens . Gefty had said nothing , because if it was true that hostile forces were alert and searching for them here , it added to their immediate danger but not at all to the absolute need to free themselves from the inexorable rush of the Great Current before they were carried beyond hope of return to their civilization . But those brief glimpses did add to the sense of urgency throbbing in Gefty 's nerves , while events , and the equally hard necessity to avoid a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept blocking him . Now the mysterious manner in which Maulbow 's unpleasant traveling companion had appeared on the main deck made it impossible to do anything but keep Kerim at his side . If Maulbow was still capable of taking a hand in matters , there was no reasonably safe place to leave her aboard the Queen . And Maulbow might be capable of it . Twice , as they hurried up the narrow angled passages along the Queen 's curving hull toward an airseal leading to the next compartment , Gefty caught a trace of the ammonialikeanimal odor coming over the ventilating system . They reached the lock without incident ; but then , as they came along the second deck hall to the ship 's magazine , there was a sharp click in the stillness behind them . Its meaning was disconcertingly apparent . Gefty hesitated , turned Kerim into a side passage , guided her along it . She looked up at his face . " It 's following us ? " " Seems to be . " No time for the spacesuits in the magazine now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had entered the second deckp185not many moments before . He helped the girl quickly down a section of ladderlike stairs to the airseal connectingthe second deck with the storage , punched a wall button there . As the lock door opened , there was another noise from the passage they had just left , as if something had thudded briefly and heavily against one of the bulkheads . Kerim uttered a little gasp . Then they were in the lock , and Gefty slapped down two other buttons , stood watching the door behind them snap shut and , a few seconds later , the one on the far side open on the dark storage deck . " Hurry now ! " They scrambled down another twelve feet of ladder to the floor of a side passage , hearing the lock snap shut behind them . As it closed , they were in complete darkness . Gefty seized Kerim 's arm , ran with her up the passage to the left , guiding himself with his fingertips on the left bulkhead . When they came to a corner , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later , he pulled open a small door , bundled the girl through , came in himself , and shut the door to a narrow slit behind them . Kerim whispered shakily , " What will we do now , Gefty ? " " Stay here for the moment . It 'll look for us in the vault first . " And it should go to the storage vault first where it had been guarding Maulbow 's machine , to hunt for them there . But it might not .... Gefty eased the gun from his pocket on the far side of Kerim . Across the dark compartmentwas another door . They could retreat a little farther here if it became necessary  --  but not very much farther . They waited in a silence that was complete except for their unsteady breathing and the distant deep pulse of the Queen 's throttled-down drives . He felt Kerim tremblingagainst him . How did Maulbow 's creature move through the airseal locks ? The operating mechanisms were simple  --  a dog might have been taught to use them . But a dog had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opening lock , a faint shimmer of light to the right of the passage mouth he was watching through the door . A heavy thump on the floor below the lock followed , then a hard click as the lock closed and complete darkness returned . The silence resumed . Seconds dragged on . Gefty 's imagination pictured the thing waiting , its great wedgeshapedhead raised as its senses probed the dark about it for a sign of the two human beings . Then a vague rushing noise began , growing louder as it approached the passage mouth , crossing it , receding rapidly again to the left . Gefty let his breath out slowly , eased the door open and stood listening again . Abruptly there was reflected light in the lock passage , coming now from the left . He said in a whisper , " It 's moving around in the main hall . We can go on the other way now , but we 'll have to be fast and keep quiet . I 've thought of how we can get rid of that thing . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doors . The one which opened into the side of the vault hall was built to allow passage of the largest chunks of freight the Queen was likely to be burdened with ; it was almost thirty feet wide and twenty feet high . The second door was just large enough to let a man in a spacesuit climb in and out of the side of the lock without using the freight door . It opened on a tiny control cubicle from which the lock 's mechanisms were operated during loadingprocesses . Gefty let Kerim and himself into the cubicle from one of the passages , steered the girl through the pitchblacknessof the little room to the chair before the control panel and told her to sit down . He groped for ap187moment at the side of the panel , found a knob and twisted it . There was a faint click . A scattering of pale lights appeared suddenly on the panel , a dark viewscreen , set at a tilt above them , reflecting their gleam . Gefty explained in a low voice , " Left side of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hall outside . No lights in either at the moment , so you do n't see anything . Only way the cargo door to the hall can be opened or closed is with these switches right here . What I want to do is get the janandra into the lock , slam the door on it and lock down the control switches . Then we 've got it trapped . " " But how are you going to get it to go in there ? " " No real problem  --  I 'll be twenty jumps ahead of it . Then I duck back up into this cubicle and lock both doors . And it 'll be inside the lock . You have the picture now ? " Kerim said unsteadily , " I do . But it sounds awfully risky , Gefty ! " " Well , I do n't like it , either , " Gefty admitted . " So I 'll start right now before I lose my nerve . As soon as I move out into the vault hall , the lighting will go on . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screen . I f you see the janandra coming before I do , yell as loud as you can . " He shifted the two inner door switches to the right . A red spark appeared in the dark viewscreen high up near the center . A second red light showed on the cubicle bulkhead beside Gefty . Beneath it an oblong section of the bulkhead turned silently away on heavy hinges , became a door two feet in thickness , which stood jutting out at a right angle into the darkness of the cargo lock . A wave of cold air moved through it into the control cubicle . On the screen another red spark appeared beside the first one.
