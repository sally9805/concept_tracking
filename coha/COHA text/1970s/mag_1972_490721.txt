THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment POLITICAL eras  --  at least , the labels of political eras  --  seem to he rushing upon us faster and faster these days . In the last ten years , we 've already had a New Frontier , a Great Society , a New Society , and a New American Revolution , the last of which we were summoned to less than a year ago in Mr. Nixon 's State of the Union Message , and which we are presumably still in . Now , what with Mr. Nixon 's China trip , and then the great Azores devaluation caper , we have reason to believe that we are moving into yet another wonderful era  --  the Era of the New Flexibility . At least , there is a powerful lot of talk on the subject of " flexibility " in the press these days , and if television could talk it would probably he saying the same thing . " The Emperor Napoleon , addressing his troops from beneath twelve feet of snow , announced today that , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agree to a minor and gradual withdrawal of the French Army from Moscow . " Well , terrific . Three cheers fur the Retreat from Moscow . The whole idea of President Nixon 's presiding over a new Era of Flexibility strikes us as a wondrous spectacle . Clearly , the China trip is a fine idea . Clearly , a small devaluation of the dollar is useful and realistic . But if it is such a smart thing to do today , why was n't it possible to do it yesterday ? After all , the people who arc now bringing us such marvels as the Nixonto-Peking Co-Prosperity Tour and the Revalued Dollar arc the same people , for the most part , who have been yammering away at us all these years with their punitive moral strictures about the true essence of America , their punitive defense measures , and their generally punitive ( at least , to the poor ) concepts of economics and taxing . Perhaps at this very moment the President is reading Bernard Fall on Vietnam , turning the last page , sighing , putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Attorney General , please .... John ? John , I 've been reading a must interesting hook .... Quite a different point of view from Melvin 's .... Some of it may he a little hard to accept , but he clearly has an intriguing case .... John , I was just wondering . Do you think we could he a hit flexible on this one ? " It is only a poor matchgirl 's dream , we grant you , but we 'll be waiting here for the answer . Getting the Goods JACK ANDERSON , whom we visited one day last week when we were in Washington , used to he known in some quarters as the fellow who took over Drew Pearson 's column . Now , like the Pentagon , he has earned the distinction of having a sheaf of secret papers named after him , and he is unquestionably an institution in his own right . His revelations about the Nixon Administration 's private attitudes toward the India-Pakistan War constitute his biggest scoop but by no means his first . He has been getting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on people in high places since 1947 , when he joined the staff of " The Washington MerryGo-Round " at the age of twenty-four . Since Mr. Pearson 's death , in 1969 , Mr. Anderson has added a hundred new papers to the column 's client list , bringing the total up to around seven hundred and making him the most widely read newspaperman in the coun try . He has also improved the column 's reputation for accuracy . Mr. Anderson 's offices are modest , tidy , and bland rooms on the ninth floor of one of those squat modern office buildings that make Washington look as if it had been emptied out of an ice-cube tray . A cheerful secretary in a blue pants suit presented us to Mr. Anderson . He is a big , broad , healthy-looking man with a squarish , full-featured face . His hair is sandy and lies flat across his head , and his sideburns are going white . He is as well bothered and clean-shaven as a senatui . He reminded us of a bed  --  not an unmade one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We started by asking him about his favorite authors . " Much as I 'd like to project to you the image of an egghead , I do n't take much time for the reading of hooks , " he said . " My reading usually consists of going through the index and picking out the things that strike my interest or fancy . I get most of the hooks on the best-seller list and keep them for reference . " We asked Mr. Anderson if Washington 's fondness for secrecy had grown in recent years , and he said , " Yes . The personality of the President influences this , and we 've had two of the most secretive Presidents in a row . Lyndon Johnson was almost neurotic on the subject . He would actualh change policies in midstream if they were discovered before he was ready to announce them . Nixon tends to hole up in his turtle shell and commune with Kissinger and God . In that order , too . I found Jack Kennedy to be quite a candid and open guy . He tended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of detail , but he 'd give you a yes or a no and it would he an honest yes or an honest no . But Nixon , like Johnson , tends to . he devious . " We asked Mr. Anderson what he thought of the possibility that his release of the secret papers would strengthen the Administration 's paranoia about the press . " I do n't see how their paranoia 22 JANUARIf 2 2 , 1 9 7 2 could get much worse , " he said . " In private conversation , their reaction to the press is paranoiac in what I would consider the medical definition of the term . If there 's something in the newspapers they do n't like , it 's never because the President has done something wrong . It 's always because the press hates him . This is the philosophy voiced by grown , mature men in the White House . It simply has not sunk in that we might nut like his policies or that he might be wrong . " A telephone call interrupted the conversation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's office . Some shelves con tained comic statuettes of political figures , and two books ? " The Case Against Congress , " by Drew Pearson and Jack Anderson , and " Washington Expose , " by Jack Anderson . The decor was impersonally modern , but Mr. Anderson had evidently picked the colors  --  various shades of mustard and light brown  --  himself , since he was dressed in those same colors , from a tan-on-white shirt to mustard-yellow socks and two-tone shoes . Mr. Anderson hung up the phone , and we asked him if he had any insight into why the President had chosen to pursue a militantly pro-Pakistan policy in spite of the lack of enthusiasm among his advisers . " Nobody liked it  --  not the State Department , not the Defense Departmt Fit , not Ambassador Keating , not our allies , " Mr. Anderson said . " I have documents expressing British bafflement at the whole thing , for example . Nothing is spelled out in the secret papers , but by reading between the lines and talking to my sources , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impression that the President was guided by personal pique as much as by any other factor . And , of course , Yahya Khan and our Ambassador to Pakistan , Joe Fa Hand , were drinking buddies . " We realized , perhaps with not much surprise , that the language Mr. Anderson writes is the language he speaks . " I do n't want to give the impression that garland 's dispatches were unprofessional he had experienced people under him at the Emhassy  --  but they reflected the kind of affection that only one drinking pal can have for another . " Mr. Anderson is a Mormon , and eschews spirits . " Have you heard what sort of pressures your sources are coming under as a result of the leaks ? " we asked . " I have , but I 'd rather not go into it , on the possibility that only my sources are receiving this treatment . But in past cases the Administration has sent F.B.I . agents and Pentagon gumshoes around pestering people , prowling corridors and flashing identification cards . They take people into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tests on the spot . " " What would you do if the government raided your office right now ? " we asked . Mr. Anderson drew himself up wrathfully . " I would howl , " he said . " I would howl , and I would hound those responsible until they were out of office , permanently . I do n't think it will happen to me , but it could happen to a less ? How should I put it ? A less visible figure . There are people in the Administration who would resort to things like that , yes . But they know I 'm capable of generating a lot of reverse heat . Still , they 're constantly investigating me . " They must have a regular F.B.I . task force that does nothing else . " " Do you have any ideas on how secrecy could be regulated institutionally , so that these leaks would n't be necessary ? " " I do . I would recommend  --  and the fact that I recommend it precludes its ever being adopted  --  the creation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ access to all government documents and with the power to declassify them . It ought to have a couple of hardheaded newsmen on it . I would he happy to serve on such a commission . " " But you 'd have to give up your column . " " It would be worth it . And , besides , I do n't see any prospect of its happening . " Mr. Anderson 's deadline for the day was approaching , so we went across the hall to look in on one of his associates , a reporter named Brit Hume . Mr. Anderson has a staff of seven , including four reporters  --  the other reporters are Les Whitten , Joe Spear , and Ray Cole  --  and , with eight columns , a radio show , and five television commentaries to produce each week , there is plenty of work for all hands . We asked Mr. Hume , who is twenty-eight and looks like a youthful Billy Graham , how Mr. Anderson treats his copy . " Well , hell either massively rewrite it or send it back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " And he puts in Anderson words  --  words like ' bigwig , ' ' brass hat , ' ' majordomo , ' gumshoe . ' The verb ' to grump ' is his . He 's forced it into the language . It 's a breezy , slangy column , which means that a lot of people read it . But it also means that a lot of other people take a condescending view of it . The worst thing about it , in their eyes , is that it 's undignified . " " Why do you prefer this to a regular newspaper job ? " we asked . " On newspapers , what I always detested was the artificial insertion into copy of balancing material that is in no way valid , " he said . " Here , if we have something to say , we can say it in a blunt , straightforward manner . I used to think that the best reporters were all those objective guys , but now I think the best reporters are the guys who work with some reforming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handout journalism . People are used to going to press conferences and writing up what is said as if it were news . That 's not reporting , that 's repeating . We do investigative reporting . Now , what most of those other guys think is investigative reporting is just doing a hunch of long stories . Every paper goes through that stage  --  Investigative teams , ' depth coverage . ' There 's no voodoo about what we do . One of the things it requires is a good working knowledge of what is available on the public record . We 're not interested in press conferences , and we 're nut interested in the kind of journalism that involves a lot of commentary and the mbsucking , either . " " Do you prefer to work on the telephone ? " " I do , because I sound more fearsome on the phone . The other end ca n't tell that I look like a kid , and , for all they know , I may be surrounded by Xerox copies of their entire files . And if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Now , Jack prefers to work in person , but he 's good on the telephone , too . " " For instance ? " " Well , you know we broke the story that Senator Murphy , of California  --  now former Senator Murphy  --  was on Patrick Frawley 's Technicolor payroll . We got the tip around noon , and Jack put in a call to Murphy . I happened to he looking in the door when Murphy called hack . Jack was snoozing , but he was up in a flash and talking . ' I get around on the Hill , ' he said . ' My sources ... the Senate Ethics Committee ... ' I might say here that the Senate Ethics Committee , which has never discovered a single ethic in all its existence , is the most tight-lipped outfit in Washington . Anyway , I could tell that Murphy was saying no to everything . Jack said , ' Now , George , I 've always liked you , and we 've always been friends , so I 'm going to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like hell . He has a funny kind of shorthand  --  half shorthand and half scrawl  --  and he never has a notebook handy , so he was using the back of an envelope . He got Murphy to admit everything .

" ) We dined with the Stewarts one evening last week in their apartment , a Danish-modern one on the West Side , and found them suntanned and relaxed after a two-week vacation in Florida . " It was our first real rest in years , " said Miss Lear , who was wearing sleek black slacks and a beige sweater . " This fall , the San Francisco Opera mounted a production of ' Eugen One-gin ' for us . Then Tom came back to the Met for ' Tristan , ' and I sang with the Philharmonic . After that , we did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we try to do it as often as possible , but what really keeps this marriage intact is golf . " " Several years ago , we swore that we wore going to arr.inge our schedule so that we could have three days of golf after every concert , " said Mr. Stewart , appearing in the kitchen doorway with a large spoon in his right hand . " But this is hard to do in the winter . " " I took up the game out of sheer desperation , " said Miss Lear , handing us a Scotch . " Whenever we had a day off , Tom disappeared to the nearest golf course . Finally , I took lessons with a pro , and within a year I was ohsmed . Now I drag ham out to play at seven-thirty in the morning . " " When I give Evy a stroke a hole , she pushes me , " Mr. Stewart said . " We sit down and decide where we want to be together , and I work around his schedule , " Miss Lear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment , because I 've changed m ) image . After achieving a certain degree of fame with modern roles  --  in Berg 's ' Wozzeck ' and ' Lulu , ' and Schoen-berg 's ' Erwartung ' ? I 've decided to concentrate on roles that are more comfortable for the voice , such as Tosca , Golfers THOMAS STEwmaT and Evelyn Lear , two of the Metropolitan Opera 's brightest stars , have managed the difficult feat of combining separate and successful singing careers with an unmistakably happy seventeen-year marriage . Mr. Stewart , a burly Texan who has penetrating blue eyes , bushy eyebrows , and a neatly trimmed brown beard , commands top fees as the outstanding Wagnerian baritone of his generation . Miss Lear , a lithe , red-haired soprano from Brooklyn , is a noted interpreter of modern music and , in opera , a specialist in what the Germans call imeressantes Filch ? roles that require a combination of good looks , vocal expertise , and acting ability . ( Curiously , both Stewarts Mimi , Manon Lescaut , Dtsdemona . " " Ey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it sound almost pleasant , because she 's so bloody musical , " Mr. Stewart said . " But she nearly sacrificed her voice in the process . " " Three years ago , I went through a vocal crisis , " Miss Lear said . " I could n't spin pianissimi , I could n't float high mitts , I could n't support , and was always hoarse . Finally , our manager  --  a twenty-four-year-old genius n.imed Matthew Epstein  --  persuaded me to drop most of my modern repertoire and sent me to Daniel Ferro , a teacher at the Manhattan School of Music . In six weeks , Ferro relaxed my throat ansi my jaw so that I could sing naturally again . Practically every soprano gets into vocal trouble at some point in her career . If she comes out of it before she 's forty , she can sing for another twenty years . But if the crisis comes after forty , or if she gets had advice , that 's it . " " I had a vocal crisis when we were starting out in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I worked my way out of it by singing nothing but basic exercises for several months . " " Nov , did the two of y no get to Berlin ! ' " we asked . " We met when we were Milliard students , " Miss Lear said . " And we got married hefoi e we had time to consider the danger of having two vocal careers in one family . Then we spent years trying to get started in New York . We auditioned for the Met , the City Opera , and innumerable Broadway . shows . We toured with a condensed version of ' Kiss Me , Kate . ' We survived fur months on the money Tom made from a radio talent-competition show called ' Chance of a Lifetime . ' He sang things like ' OP Man River , ' and was eventually beaten by a man who played Swiss bells . " " It was a nightmare , " Mr. Stewart said . " I had a family to support  --  Evy has two children by a previous marriage  --  and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persuaded me to become a singing cowboy . I took guitar lessons and auditioned for Arthur Godfrey , but he turned me down , on the ground that I was too professional . " " That was rock hottom , " said Miss Lear . " So in 1957 we applied for  --  and got  --  Fulbrights to study at the Hochschule fiir Musik in Berlin . We figured that with a year of European study behind us we could teach in a university . But six weeks after we arrived , Tom auditioned for Carl Ebert , who was then the head of the Berlin Opera , and was offered a three-year contract . " " I was a bass , but they needed a bass-baritone , so that 's what they got , " Mr. Stewart said . " Now I 'm described as a Iltidenbar ; ion . " Miss Lear joined the Berlin Opera a year later , and , with the security of long-term contracts , both Stewarts settled down to learn their craft . " It 's easy to get lost in a big house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " LNihat we did was fight our way out of this box . We learned roles we were n't scheduled to sing , and we badgered people into letting us do them without orchestra rehearsals . We were always available . " " And we never said no , " Miss Lear added . " I agreed to sing Lulu in 1960 , not realizing it was one of the most difficult vocal scores in opera . ' ciVlien I did look at the music , I nearly fainted . But Lulu was my break . That same year , Tom took over the part of Am-fortis in Parsifal ' on three weeks ' notice when the man who was scheduled to sing it got sick . Tom had n't seen or heard Parsifalf " " Now wt , plan at least a year ahead , " Mr. Stewart said . " We 're singing .

" Embarkation WE were aboard the S.S. France , the world 's Ion Best liner , last week , on the afternoon of a massive embarkation . The France was about to begin a ninety-one-day tour of the world , and there was considerable activity on each of her eleven decks . On the Veranda Deck ( Pont Veranda ) , a hip young public-relations man was telling members of the press how expensive the tour would he for some of the people taking it . Sonic people , he said , were paying nearly a hundred thousand dollars for their ackommodation . The **26;4093;TOOLONG re wascompelling ? " t ( nG CRUISE IS LAUNCHED ON OCEANS OF CI TAMl'AGNE , " the Veins reported the next day  --  and we noticed that everyone around seemed somehow the better for being in the proximity of such a magnificent outlay of cash . On a cruise , the 100G spender , if he did not exist , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's good time . " I could not possibly tell you their names , " the young public-relations man said , " but , of course , I know their cabin numbers . " Then he talked briefly about the France 's least expensive accommodations  --  an inside cabin on Deck I ) ( Pont Drauvilfr ) . For the cruise , he said , this cabin cost five thousand dollars per person . " You would use a D Deck cabin only for sleeping and shaving , " he added . The area on the Veranda Deck where the young public-relations man met with members of the press had been appropriated from the Club des Jeunes , normal ) the rendezvous of the younger set aboard the France . The Club des Jeunes was decorated with autographed pictures of French entertainment personalities and supplied with pinball machines . As the public-relations man talked , one lone : Rune , of about fourteen , wearing a blue double-breasted blazer , ran a game on a sluggish pinball machine and declined to particip.ite in the excitement of embarkation . We set out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out for big spenders . There were people all over , but big spender 's , these days , have camouflaged themselves to look like everybodY else , and are hard to spot when they are not actually in their I DOG suites . We thought we would at least have a peek at a 100G suite , but first we looked through the ship 's public rooms . Everywhere , there was activity , movement , gaiety . But there was a certain unsatisfactory malaise about as well . It was like the Christmas season at a department store in trouble . We saw the Saint-Tropez Lounge , which was decorated with orange vinyl chairs , and the Versailles Dining Room , which featured pea-green vinyl chairs , and the Trianon Dining Room , which had mustard vinyl chairs and illuminated plastic wall panels painted in the manner of children 's paintings . We were not alone in exploring the ship . We ran into a woman who wanted to see one of the swimming pools . " Is there a swimming pool on this floor ? " she asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and as we left she was making little swimming gestures . We saw the theatre  --  a wonderfully extravagant purple-and-gray room  --  mid had a chat with a reticent florist delivering h ( m-voyage arrangements ( " For thirty dollars , the top price , you get mostly orchids " ) , and then found ourself outside the Ile-de-France Suite . Nobody home  --  or , at least , nobody- answered . At the Normandie Suite , on the other side of the ship , we were met by a vivacious lady in a blue dress , who showed us the suite and introduced its to her husband . They were sharing the suite with friends , she said , and she and her husband were sleeping in what was normally the dining room . She introduced us to Marcel , who runs the suite 's private kitchen , and told us that she and her husband are aboard the France for six months out of every year . " Wherever the France goes , we go , " she said . We asked her if she was interested in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the passengers . " I 'm passing up China because of the hardships , " she said . After leaving the Normandie Suite , we decided to visit the ship 's chapel  --  the one important room we had n't seen . We searched it out and went in . It was a room of chrome and stained glass . Over the altar was a rendering of Christ in green stained glass , and flanking the altar were electric votive candles . We were noting all this when a group of passengers entered the chapel deep in an undeniably secular conversation . " Vans eles lams to maison de Dieu , " said a voice sharp enough to stiffen our spine . Turning around , we saw a small man standing in a hack corner of the room . He was dressed very simply , in a black suit and a white shirt without a collar . In the lapel of his suit jacket there was a pin in the shape of a cross . There was nothing about him to suggest an elaborate cruise for big spenders , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not seem completely at home in the chrome chapel , even though he knew that It was the house of God . We asked him a polite question in English . " J r parle franceis , " he said . " Jr parle francais srarment . " We did not feel brave enough to try- and translate our Tu. stion , and left .
