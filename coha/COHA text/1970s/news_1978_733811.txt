txt Which is the best way to oppose apartheid in South Africa ? This is a very real problem for international companies operating here . Should they try to get their money out of the country ? Or should they pump investments into the local economy under strict conditions and in such a way that the consequent expansion imposes impossible strains on the apartheid structure ? The latest big company to announce that it intends to try to kill apartheid with kindness , as it were , is General Motors South Africa , which has its headquarters in the windy east coast city of Port Elizabeth . General Motors says it will integrate all its facilities for all its 4,000 , mostly black , workers and start special training programs that will benefit blacks especially . The cost will be more than $4 million . Particularly interesting is that there has not been so much as a whisper of complaint from the South African Government // From page 1 Diluting apartheid : companies have a plan about this highly publicized decision to fly in the face of doctrinaire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rushed to tell the country that their plans are the same if not better . Ford Motor Company , for example , said that it had been running an advancement program for blacks for five years , and that it had consequently " gained a leadership position in this field . " Also , said local managing director Brian Pitt , Ford was the first motor company here to negotiate with a black trade union concerning the affairs of its workers . Chris Griffiths , the chairman of Sigma Motor Corporation , which has a 25 percent Chrysler Company shareholding , said his company also is running training programs for blacks , and paying the same wages to whites and blacks doing the same work . The most important long-term benefit for blacks of the latest General Motors decision will be the opportunity to aspire to top management positions , which have previously been blocked because of race barriers , and to take part in technical training courses side by side with whites .

Are foreign companies justified in believing that they are doing more to bring about peaceful political change in South Africa by maintaining their investments and working against the system from within , rather than disinvesting and getting out ? Two important public figures from widely divergent backgrounds are effective spokesmen for those who believe that they are . One is Chief Gatsha Buthelezi , the powerful black leader of the Zulu-based Inkatha cultural and political movement . The other is Harry Oppenheimer , multimillionaire mining and financial tycoon . Chief Buthelezi says that people who call for disinvestments in South Africa are " oversimplifying the matter . " Black workers would be the first to loose their jobs , and the first to go hungry . And he points out : " The fact is that while Botswana , Mozambique , and other countries preach disinvestment , South Africa is maintaining the Mozambique railways and upholding the economy of Botswana . Other surrounding countries would also not survive without South African help . " - - Mr. Oppenheimer believes that if South Africa is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become the preserve of the whites ? leading to polarization between white and black and thus increasing the possibility of full-scale violent revolution . On the other hand , " The only way to bring about peaceful change is to allow a modern economy to build up which can not exist without the participation of vast numbers of black people holding down skilled and highly paid jobs , " he said . The country 's population figures support this argument . The 4.5 million whites simply can not fill all the , skilled and executive jobs the economy provides at present , and any sort of accelerated expansion would create a tremendous demand for more skilled blacks . With economic muscle to back it up , increasing black political demands probably would be even more difficult to resist than they are now . The arguments for disinvestment , meanwhile , are short , sharp , and ultimately , revolutionary . Under such a policy , it is argued , a hungry , restive black population eventually would overthrow the whites and take political control .
