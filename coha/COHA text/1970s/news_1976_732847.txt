txt Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger made a farewell appeal to America 's allies today to maintain strong defenses while pursuing mutual restraint with the Russians to avoid " an unimaginable catastrophe . " Winding up his last official overseas mission , Mr. Kissinger defended detente and virtually every other aspect of his Excerpts from news conference , page 8 often-controversial policies , including the Middle East , Africa , China , economics and morality in foreign affairs . He mixed his ' serious comments with jokes , punctuating the hour-long session with laughter . Mr. Kissinger 's news conference at the headquarters of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization followed the end of the alliance 's year-end ministerial meeting and the release of a communique that , as expected , warned of Soviet military buildups and rejected Warsaw Pact proposals to bar the first use of nuclear weapons and , in effect , to keep Spain out of the alliance . Praise From Officials The focus at this conference , however , was not on the communique but on Mr. Kissinger 's taking leave of his office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has so dominated allied diplomacy that virtually every official here felt compelled to praise him at this morning 's final session . Joseph M. A. H. Luns , the Secretary General of NATO , said : " We in the alliance have been privileged to work with a man to whom the adjective ' great ' can be applied with sincerity . " " 1 am convinced that you will stand in history as one of the most effective foreign ministers of our century , " Mr. Luns said . " You have understood the underlying realities of our time . Your goals have been the goals not only of the free world , but of ordinary men and women everywhere  --  peace , security and prosperity . And to this task you have brought your extraordinary , energy and outstanding brilliance . " Mr. Kissinger , who flew to London after the conference , had high praise for his successor-to-be , Cyrus R. Vance , but sought to leave the impression that the policies followed by the Nixon-Ford-Kissinger administrations would generally be adhered to in the future . Questions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy had taken enough note of questions of morality , Mr. Kissinger argued that the Carter administration would probably not be very different . " It is necessary to have strong moral conviction but it also is necessary to bring into relation the realities of the situation With moral purposes , " he said . " I believe foreign policy without moral conviction lacks a sense of direction , " he said . " What balance is struck in each administration is very hard to predict and hard to foretell in the abstract . " He said a leader had to mix the absolutes of moral princples with the practical problems of diplomacy , Particular attention was focused on East-West relations , and while Mr. Kissinger did not use the word d  --  tente , he stressed the need to mix strong defense with creative diplomacy  --  the core of his detente policy . ' Perhaps Unimaginable Catastrophe ' After underscoring the necessity of not allowing the Soviet Union to achieve political or economic gains by use of arms , he said : " At the same time , the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , depends on whether we can , in relations between East and West , find solutions to our common problems and a code of restraint lest we slide again , as has happened so often in history , through a series of miscalculations and the accumulation of marginal advantages into a perhaps unimaginable catastrophe . " " So we have the task of security and the task of construction of peace and the challenge to Western society whether they can pursue both policies simultaneously or slight one at the expense of the other , " he said . Warning to Moscow The communique cited " with concern the high level of military expenditure in the Soviet Union and the continued disquieting expansion of the military power of the Warsaw Pact . " It also , however , called for efforts at seeking areas of mutual interest with Communist countries while warning Moscow that detente demanded reduced tensions around the world , not just in certain areas . Because this was his last news conference in Europe  --  and there is none scheduled for Washington  --  Mr , Kissinger was asked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But he continued his policy of avoiding such questions by quipping that " it 's too early to write obituaries and having such a distinguished group of people here that have been analyzing my drawbacks and achievements  --  with emphasis on the former  --  I would not want to interfere with your work . " Shuttle Diplomacy Defended On a serious note , he said that the " ultimate test " of any Secretary of State was how well he contributed " to the unity , vitality and strength of free peoples  --  especially the peoples of the North Atlantic area . " At another point , he said he believed the alliance was more united today than in recent years . Mr. Kissinger said that if asked he would offer advice to the Carter administration but that after Jan. 20 , he would , like journalists , be " infallible " and able to dish out criticism . On the Middle East , Mr. Kissinger defended his shuttle diplomacy as having been based on careful consideration , not a " personal preference . " He predicted that the new administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeated his assessment of recent months that the " objective conditions that make for peace in the Middle East are better than they have been in decades . " But he offered no formula for success and repeated that unless the Carter administration changed the policy , the United States would not deal with the Balestine Liberation Organization until it ; - ; accepted Israel and pertinent United ? ' : NaCons resolutions calling for negotiations . The main point of the alliance 's . dommuniqu ? dealt with the rejection of recent Warsaw Pact proposals . It said that , alliance countries , " in the event of al:a -- tack on them , can not renounce the use , as may be required for defense , of any of the means available to them .
