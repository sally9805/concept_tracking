It appeared to be one of the biggest postholiday buying crushes ever . Shoppers crowded stores across the nation , scooping up bargains and providing some extra year-end cheer to beleaguered retailers . <P> Well into the December shopping season , it had looked as if the ghost of Christmas 1974 would be haunting merchants for many months to come . During the last full week of shopping before Christmas , nationwide sales were no better than even with the week before . What was worse , in an industry that has become accustomed to smashing year-to-year increases in holiday buying , sales were only 5% ahead of the same period in 1973-a decline in real terms when a 12% inflation rate is counted in . <P> As the predictions of relative doom and gloom mounted , retailers throughout the land cut prices , optimistically convincing themselves that Santa would yet arrive in the form of a last-minute buying surge that would cause plenty of jingle at the cash registers , after all .

" Jordan Marsh , Zayre Corp . and Filene 's stores in Boston all enjoyed the eleventh-hour boom , as did Rich 's in Atlanta , especially in small gift items . In San Francisco , the Livingston Bros , apparel chain actually had its best day ever the Monday before Christmas . And as far as overall holiday sales were concerned , business was up a healthy 8% over 1973 . <P> One of the healthiest sales cities was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 33% greater than the year before . The prime reason is that steel-industry demand and employment remains strong , and steelworkers have been protected against the erosion in buying power that afflicted most other wage earners in 1974 by the cost of living escalators they won in their union contracts early last year . Says Lawrence Finley , a local Gimbel 's executive : " Psychologically , the attitude here is bullish . Even the Steelers are winning . "
