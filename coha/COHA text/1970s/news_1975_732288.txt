txt Roxie Jo Logan , once the dark-haired town beauty of tiny Plains , Ga. , was on the phone . The last time Jimmy Carter had seen her , they 'd both been 16 and , well , sweethearts . Now , 35 years later , Roxie Jo Logan had become Roxie Jo Roach . She had married , moved to Miami Beach , turned Republican , and given birth to a daughter who wants to be Miss America . Jimmy Carter , son of the peanut-farming Carters down the road , grew up to be a Naval officer , nuclear physicist , **35;832;TOOLONG , and , most recently , the former governor of Georgia . He wants to be President of the ? Jnited States . " Are you as pretty as you ever were ? " Carter was asking softly into the phone . The candidate , who always says things softly , smiled and blushed at his own question . THREE REPORTERS  --  not wanting to miss a rare , personal moment with one of the hottest presidential candidates in at least a month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took notes . There are no private moments for hot political candidates . Then , after a brief discussion of how her brother le , bow she happened to hear Carter on the radio talk show a few minutes before and decided to call , how things change and time flies , Jimmy Carter smiled his shy , toothy smile end turned the conversation around to business . " You 'll hale to Mange your registration , " Carter said . " You have a special reason now . " Indeed , when Roxie Jo pulls the lever for Carter as she 's sure to do in Florida 's Democratic primary March 9 , she will have a special reason : The candidate gave her special treatment . But when thousands of other Floridians pull the same lever on the seine day , a lot of them will probably think *y ' re doing it for the same reason as Roxie Jo . Jimmy Carter , who has been running officially for an entire year now , makes people feel special . LIKE SUSAN HANEY , a 20-year-old University of Miami @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who heard Carter make his standard campaign speech , rushed up afterwards to ask the candidate a question . As Carter turned to answer and shake her hand , he gave her his full attention  --  his strong blue eyes boring down on her blinking ones . In a few seconds , Susan 's face began to quiver slightly , and she started nodding her head after each easy phrase . When it was over , she looked dazzled and a little stunned . In much the same way , Carter uses his seductive aw-shucks charm on peeple like Burl McCormick , a construction company executive who voted for George Wallace in 1972 . People like Burl and there are a lot of them in Floridal have always liked George Wallace because he 's a fighter who talks about America as though it stopped at the outskirts of Washington , D. C. CARTER IS N'T as noisy as Wallace , but some of the things he says sound familiar to anyone who has seen the Alabama governor in his previous losing presidential campaigns . He sounds a little like Wallace , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horrible , bloated , confused , overrated bureaucracy ever created by human beings . " He also sounds a little like Wallace when he talks about Wallace . " Wallace talks about taking the briefcases away from the pointy-headed liberals and throwing them in the tidal basin , " Carter told one group . " And that 's just about all he 's capable of low . " ? But Carter prefers  --  even in Florida where Wallace won the 1972 primary with 41.5 per cent of the vote  --  to talk about the ways he and Wallace are different . CARTER IS THE one , he reminds people , who said at his inauguration for governor in 1971 that " the time for raclal discrimination is over . " Wallace is the one who stood in the schoolhouse door more than 10 years ago and bellowed : " Segregation now ; segregation forever . " For Carter supporters , it is the Good South versus Bad South . The New South versus the Old South . The richer , smarter , smoother South versus the poorer , lazier , louder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the two . " Let 's face it , Wallace has proved he ca n't be elected president . Jimmy can . " THERE ARE STILL a lot of people who doubt that a governor from Georgia or Alabama or anywhere else in the South can get the Democratic nomination , much less beat next year 's Republican choice . But , for whatever reasons  --  Carter 's wide grin , the full Kennedyesque head of hair , the combination peanut farmer-nuclear physicist , the sweet way he says , " When I am President " ? Jimmy Carter has the momentum . In Orlando a few weeks ago , a straw poll of delegates at the Democratic state convention showed 67 per cent in favor of Carter . BUT THE BIG charge for Carter recently has been the attention of the national press . Time , Newsweek , Rolling Stone , and People have all featured him in the last few weeks . " Sure , right now he 's the one , " said a staff worker with the Democratic National Committee . " But Carter 's strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 's always won by surprise , and this latest burst has taken out the surprise . " Indeed , Carter 's biggest political success so far  --  against former Gov . Carl Sanders who had the support of all the big Democrats and all the major newspapers  --  was something of a shock to many Georgians . Carter , the former school board member who supported integration morethan 10 years ago , ran a bewildering underdog 's campaign in 1970 . He criticized Sanders for refusing to allow George Wallace to make a speech on state property , called Sanders a liberal not a compliment in many parts of Georgia , and received the endorsements of well-known segregationists , including former Gov . Marvin Griffin . THUS , THE liberals who were confused by his anti-liberal campaign speeches were joined by the conservatives who believed it all until Carter took over . One of the first things Carter did as governor was to hang a portrait of Dr. Martin Luther King in the Georgia capital . He may also be facing some very down-to-earth political problems in the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff members have not received their salary for the last two months . In the meantime , Sen. Henry " Scoop " Jackson ID. , Wash. has been stockpiling dollars  --  over a million of them so far  --  and he 's planning to spend some of his hoard in Florida . Jackson , . with his strong pro-Israel stand that appeals to the Jewish vote in Miami , could hurt Carter badly . And it Carter does n't win Florida or come a close second to Wallace , he will be out of the race for President . BUT AS RABBI Sanford Shapero. a friend of Carter 's , put it last week at the Tiger Bay Club in Miami : " When the euphoria wears off , it will be like the two frogs who fell into a milk can . " " It seems these two frogs jumped and jumped to try to get out of the milk can , and one of them finally saw no hope , sank to the bottom and drowned . " The other kept kicking and kicking and kicking , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 300 looked for either a joke or a message , " until finally the milk turned to butter and he just walked out . " The candidate smiled and nodded his head . It was not a message lost on Jimmy Carter .
