Threats , warnings and shifting signals on the hostages " <P> Carter does n't know how ridiculous he sounds when he threatens us , " jeered Iran 's tempestuous Ayatullah Ruhollah Khomeini . " The noises he makes are similar to those of a frightened lion , who does three things : he roars in the hope of frightening off his challenger , he makes rude noises because fear causes his muscles to contract , and he sways his tail in hopes of finding a mediator . " <P> It can prove dangerous for anyone confronting a lion to conclude that the animal is frightened . But given the Iranian taste for hyperbolic rhetoric , there was a certain truth in Khomeini 's metaphor . Jimmy Carter , frustrated by the failure of his economic pressures to win the release of the 50 American hostages , let it be known that he was seriously considering a naval blockade . Before it comes to that , however , he is formally asking the United Nations Security Council this week to impose some form of economic sanctions on Iran-a step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1966 . Noting that Tehran has repeatedly ignored U.N . pleas for the hostages ' release , Carter declared on nationwide TV : " Iran stands in arrogant defiance of the world community . " At stake , said the President , are the " foundations of civilized diplomacy and the integrity of international law . " <P> Carter did not disclose just what sanctions the U.S. would request . But aides said they will probably include a partial trade embargo , exempting Iranian imports of food and Pharmaceuticals and exports of oil . Carter had no advance word from Moscow , aides said , whether the Soviets would go along with sanctions or block them with a veto . <P> Thus , in the seventh week of the cruel stalemate over the hostages , tensions mounted again-in Iran , the U.S. and also in Panama , where the deposed Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi took up residence on the Pacific resort island of Contadora . In Panama City , several hundred leftists marched through the streets , spray-painting FUERA EL SHAH ( Shah get out ) on trees and walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 30 helmeted officers mounted on motorcycles charged a ragtag band of 100 marchers , led by part-time Radio Commentator Miguel Bernal . The police and National Guard beat the demonstrators to the ground with 18-in. - long red-and-black rubber truncheons and hauled them off to jail . <P> In the midst of the uproar , while the Shah calmly set up housekeeping at his new haven , U.S. officials in Washington were trying to determine how his abrupt departure from the U.S. would affect the plight of the hostages . An answer soon came from Tehran , and then another and another . First , in their 74th communique of the crisis , the militants holding the U.S. embassy bluntly declared that " to reveal the treacherous plots of the criminal United States and for its punishment , the hostage spies will be tried . " The same hard line was reflected in a banner headline by the newspaper Islamic Republic , which usually serves as the organ for Khomeini 's Islamic Republic Party : THE TRIAL OF THE HOSTAGES IS DEFINITE .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
