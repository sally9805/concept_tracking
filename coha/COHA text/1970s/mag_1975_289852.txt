On the morning of Feb. 6 , Giovanni Spadolini walked into a committee room in Rome 's Chamber of Deputies and got ready to debate . Three months earlier , Aldo Moro 's center-left government had given him the newly invented and resonant-sounding portfolio of Ministro dei Beni Culturali e Ambientali ( Minister of Cultural and Environmental Resources ) . Since then , Spadolini had been striving to get more money and protection for Italy 's impoverished and vulnerable museums . Two new bills were ready to be argued . " Just as the debate was beginning , " Spadolini recalls , " a colleague in the chamber came up to me and said , ' It 's too late .

No Renaissance painter has spoken more eloquently to the 20th century than Piero , with his vision of a sublimely abstract order dwelling in a thicket of concrete and manifest forms-figures , architecture , drapery ; and because there were so few known paintings by him ( apart from the great fresco cycle in Arezzo ) , the night 's work in Urbino seemed less of a theft than a lobotomy . " The theft of the Raphael and the Piero della Francesca masterpieces is a loss beyond measurement , " said Italy 's leading art historian and critic Giulio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existing copies of Dante 's Divine Comedy and the verses of Petrarch were suddenly to disappear from the face of the earth .
