AN UNMARRIED WOMAN <P> Directed and Written by Paul Mazursky <P> Paul Mazursky 's best movies - Bob and Carol and Ted and Alice , Blume in Love and now An Unmarried Woman - are bulletins from a combat zone . The battlefield is affluent urban America ; the war is the sexual revolution of the 1970s . Mazursky describes the skirmishes in all their neurotic glory , tots up the emotion al casualties and tries to identify the survivors . He does so with both compassion and dark wit , and the result has been a remarkable string of films that document the changing mores of an exasperating decade . Indeed , Mazursky 's social report age is so accurate that one can almost ignore his failures of style and storytelling . <P> In An Unmarried Woman , the director leaves his favorite turf , swinging Southern California , for the less laid-back precincts of Manhattan . He has the terrain down pat . The film unfolds in chic SoHo lofts , Upper East Side high-rises and glittery mock-deco bars . The characters are people who favor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purr of the cable-TV news ticker , wear Adidas sneakers when jogging and fall in lust while shopping at Bloomingdale 's . They are well-intentioned people , but they have a sad habit of wounding each other . Mazursky - whose sensibility is half John Cheever , half Jewish mother - wants to love them all . <P> His greatest affection is reserved for his title character , Erica ( Jill Clayburgh ) , a Vassar-educated 37-year-old who suddenly loses her seemingly devoted husband of 16 years ( Michael Murphy ) to a younger woman . For the first time , Erica is without a man , and she must learn how to adjust . Eventually she does , but not without the help of a therapist and a new lover , an artist played by Alan Bates . By the end , Erica has arrived at a state of hard-won feminist bliss . <P> The film 's tedious final half-hour is more ideologically right-minded than dramatically convincing . Mazursky never has figured out how to wrap up his movies . Yet along the way his script offers one moment of recognition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her female friends get together for in formal consciousness-raising sessions that are accurately described as " part Mary Hartman , part Ingmar Bergman . " Mazursky has also written some moving scenes for Erica and her 15-year-old daughter ( Lisa Lucas ) ; he understands painfully well the bottomless angers and conflicting loyalties that divorce creates among both adults and children . <P> The acting is exemplary : everyone onscreen seems to be an old friend . Some minor players make uncommon impact , especially Andrew Duncan as a lecherous pressagent and Linda Miller as a divorcee who takes up with a 19-year-old lover . As the not wholly unsympathetic husband , Murphy pulls off a daring piece of acting-a faked yet affecting crying jag that accompanies his guilt-ridden confession of infidelity . Bates , of course , is the most appealing suitor that any woman , married or unmarried , could wish .
