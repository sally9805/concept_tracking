Like the deaths of ancient kings , the passing of Presidents calls for certain dispensations for the populace . President Nixon declared a day of mourning last week upon the death of Harry S. Truman and ordered most Government services shut down . That meant , among other things , that some 300 men due to be sworn in that day will probably beat the draft . Daniel J. Cronin , assistant deputy Selective Service director , sent telegrams to draft boards around the country canceling the inductions . As it turns out , that was the last induction day of 1972 . Officially , the group can still be called up any time between now and April 1-but so far no draft calls have been issued for January or February . Thus the odds are lengthening that none of the lucky 300 will be the last American to die in Viet Nam .
