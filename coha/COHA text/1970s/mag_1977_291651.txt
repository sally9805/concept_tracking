The economy aside , Jimmy Carter certainly bought home an outstanding report card for the spring semester of his freshman year . For " staying close to the people , " he was given a 93% rating by those who expressed an opinion ; for " providing moral leadership , " 88% ; for improving relations with the nation 's friends and allies , 83% ; for restoring Americans ' pride in themselves , 80% ( see chart page 16 ) . <P> Yet so mixed are America 's feelings that between 25% and 50% of the voters said they had no opinion about Carter 's handling of most issues , ranging from welfare reform to curbing inflation - and the mood of the nation was worsening . TIME 'S national mood indicator , based on a series of questions that measure Americans ' confidence in their country , has slipped two points since March , to 45%- though it is still 2 times higher than the Watergate level of about three years ago . <P> Candor &; Folksiness . These are among the findings of a nationwide telephone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TIME by the opinion-research firm of Yankelovich . Skelly &; White Inc . A comparison with a similar TIME survey conducted last March shows that Carter has lost a sprinkling of popularity points in some areas but has registered gains in others . Most notably , voters who feel that Carter is coming to grips with the energy problem increased from 64% to 71% . <P> Much of Carter 's popularity continues to be based on his candor , folksiness and straight-from-the-hip moralizing . His ratings since March for providing jobs , maintaining strong defenses and reducing unfairness each improved by 1% . One worrisome finding for the President : in March , 48% of those surveyed said their impressions of Carter had improved since the Inauguration ; in the May sampling that figure shrank to 38% . At the same time , in March , only 6% said they had formed a worse impression of Carter since he took office ; in May that figure grew to 14% . <P> For at least some voters , one reason for their disappointment is that they have increasingly come to view Carter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election , 35% of the voters surveyed saw Carter as either a liberal or a radical ; in the new survey , about half that many - 18%- described him in those terms . <P> One issue facing Carter proved to be the focus of a high degree of voter concern . Fully 65% of those polled expressed the fear that there would not be enough money left in the Government 's Social Security pot by the time they were ready to retire . Asked about Carter 's proposal to boost the Social Security tax for employers and workers , 56% of the Democrats who were polled found it to be " fair , " while 54% of Republicans called the proposal " unfair . " <P> A broader consensus opposed the ban on saccharin imposed by the federal Food and Drug Administration . An impressive 75% of those questioned said that instead of banning the sweetener , the Government should mandate labels warning of its potential dangers and should allow consumers to decide for themselves whether or not to use it . Moreover , 53% said it was wrong to ban saccharin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skimpy.
