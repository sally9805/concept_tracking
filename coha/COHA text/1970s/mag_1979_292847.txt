Carter 's Coup <P> To the Editors : <P> Sound the trumpets , beat the drums in honor of and with profound gratitude to that peanut farmer March 19 from Plains , who has accomplished , by his own initiative , what no other American President has . <P> When the peace treaty is signed a national holiday should be declared by Israel , Egypt and the U.S. so that all the people can pay homage to three courageous leaders . <P> Elsie Kendis <P> Philadelphia <P> It 's too bad about our " moral " obligation to Israel , because our economic interests lie with the Arab world . <P> Bruce E. Hendry <P> Minneapolis <P> Carter may be the hero of the Middle East peace treaty , but one wonders if the history books will also give due honor to the downtrodden taxpayers of our country , who have to bear the burden of shelling out the billions of dollars to bribe Sadat and Begin to agree to Carter 's terms . <P> John K. Stanyer <P> Scotts Valley , Calif . <P> Strip and Search @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've had one traffic ticket in my life , with none of the strip searching in the police station March 19 you mention . However , I would probably become a basket case if such a thing did happen to me . A person seems to be guilty until proved innocent . I do n't want to sue after it happens ; I want to keep it from happening . <P> ( Mrs. ) Linda Patterson <P> Sherman , Texas <P> Now , in addition to worrying about rape whenever I get into my car alone , I have to fear being hauled into a police station where , for some minor traffic offense , I may undergo a publicly financed sexual assault . <P> Leigh Lawrence <P> Bay side , N.

One thing seems to be so universally true : we very often wish to be as happy as others , who are usually not quite as happy as we think they are . <P> ( Mrs. ) Susan W. Embich <P> New York City <P> The road to happiness is always under construction . <P> Pat Kelly <P> Cambridge , Mass . <P> Happiness comes from knowing Jesus . <P> Anne Robertson <P> Hope , R.I. <P> Train of Thoughts <P> With gasoline getting increasingly scarce and expensive , what are people going to do if Congress goes through with Transportation Secretary Brock Adams ' proposals to slash the Amtrak passenger service March 19 ? There will be few trains to fall back on . Do you think Americans will be content to stay home ? <P> Walter G. Wight <P> Palm Coast , Fla . <P> If the departments of Energy and Transportation were combined , perhaps Washington would then begin to perceive the importance of balanced transportation . If other countries have energy-saving systems , we can too . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
