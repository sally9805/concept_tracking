A healthy man who wants to kill himself and a sick one who wants to live but is doomed for lack of a vital organ appear to have little in common . But Psychiatrist Paul H. Blachly of the University of Oregon Medical School believes that they have something to offer each other . He advocates a " symbiotic juxtaposition " of the two-bringing them together so that the potential suicide can gain a new outlook on life by donating either blood or an organ to the person who needs it to live . <P> Writing in the current issue of Life-Threatening Behavior , the new official journal of the American Association of Suicidology , * Psychiatrist Blachly suggests that the suicidal person who wants to destroy his whole body may find an alternative in sacrificing just part of it . When Eisenhower was suffering repeated heart attacks , Blachly recalls , at least 20 people offered him their hearts ; such offers frequently come from people who are looking for a way to die . But that death wish might be purged , he reasons , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own life . People who donate a kidney , Blachly notes , often experience " a sustained feeling of satisfaction and of being noble , " and their personal relationships frequently become more satisfying . <P> Non-Fatal Sacrifices . Even more important in Blachly 's thinking is the fact that suicides decrease in wartime and other periods demanding personal sacrifice ; then , he says , " the intensity of egoism and anomie is diminished as the individual participates in a common social goal . " To put his theory into practice , Blachly proposes an alliance between organ-transplant centers and some of the many suicide-prevention services that are now in existence . The services , which usually offer psychiatric help to callers , would refer appropriate cases to transplant centers as possible donors . The customary two-or three-month waiting period before surgery would give psychiatrists time to study the would-be donor 's motives and his chances of benefiting from giving an organ . The result , Blachly says , might well be an enhanced " sense of dignity and self-determination " on the part of the donor that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms . " In ancient days , kings , favorite sons , daughters , wives or slaves were often slain in sacrificial rites as a means of atonement and because , as Psychoanalyst Roger Money-Kyrle once wrote , " the gift of life places one with the gods . " Blachly believes that nonfatal sacrifices might have the same expiative effect . <P> *A jargonistic term for the study of suicidal behavior.
