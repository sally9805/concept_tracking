txt While it is still too early to tell with certainty , there is indication that President Ford misjudged the mood of the American people , and that he did not go far enough , In his antiantlinflation proposals . A Monitor sampling of opinion around the U.S found expressions like these from Republican leaders , this one from a highly respected Midwesterner ? " I think the President miscalculated what the American people really wanted I find they are so fed up with rising prices that they have got to the place where they want a President to come out and say ? " You must really sacrifice now , and you will have to do this , this , and this for the next year or two ' " Maybe the President would invoke controls , certainly he would oppose tough guidelines on wages and prices . The President does n't yet understand It 's a different world . It 's now good politics to take a hard line with the public . This was no time for gradualism " A Republican state chairman , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have been tougher . " Oil crisis hokum ? And another Midwest Republican leader put it this way : " The voluntary program just wo n't work at this time Too many people feel they responded patriotically last year ? and that the oil companies profited from it .. . that the crisis was a lot of hokum It will be much harder to sell voluntary action this time " And a Republican chieftain from the East made this comment " I think Ford should have been tougher The people were expecting more sacrifice " Meanwhile , both Republicans and Democrats wait to see how effective the plan is If voters pay extra taxes and inflation does not stabilize , they said , then the Republicans would suffer The relative coolness with which the President 's proposal was received in Congress centered mainly on the Ford plan for a 5 percent surcharge on incomes over $15,000 The initial opposition to the plan seemed to indicate that , at best , the President would have to settle for a revised surtax and one , too , that would have to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present tax loopholes are closed The Republican Senate leader , Hugh Scott of Pennsylvania , ' suggested a surtax with a $20,000 floor . Republican Sen. Jacob K Javits of New York thinks a $25,000 floor would be about right The President got support for his surtax from Sens . John C Stennis ( D ) of Mississippi and William Brock ( R of Tennessee . Majority leader Mike Mansfield has said he backed the surtax idea in principle . But such Republican conservatives as Sen Paul J. Fannin of Arizona and Rep. Joel T Broyhill of Virginia have come out strongly against the proposal . // *No time for gradualism ' // Said a high-placed Democrat from the Southwest : " 1 do n't think it will help or hurt the President one way or another . " A Republican state chairman from the West echoed this point of view . The immediate political impact of the President 's speech seemed , from the sampling , to be mild , one way or the other . Said one high-placed Democrat from the Southwest : " I do n't think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other . " Said a Republican leader from the Midwest : " This surtax hits us where our Republican political base is ? among the middle- and upper-income people . But I do n't think this will turn them away from us . " However , they will want something in return They 'll want prices to stabilize fairly soon And then ? after they start paying the tax ? they 'll expect some action . You 'll have ev ? eryone disgruntled and anti-Ford if prices keep rising while they pay this extra tax " ' Ford circus ' hit A Southern Republican state chairman objected to what he called the " Ford circus ? all this summitry and spotlight on himself . " " The big problem here , " he said , " Is that If Ford does n't deliver on inflation ? and perhaps nobody can ? then he and all Republicans may he In great trouble politically " This Republican leader , together with some others contacted , said that , politically , the people were taking a " wait-and-sec , " attitude on the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cautious In assess-tog political impact But they said they were convinced that if the President 's plan was approved and then did not pay off , the Democrats would benefit at the polls . Will Americans play ? President Ford 's 10-point economic program falls to come to grips adequately either with inflation or recession , according to a range of professional economists " He wound up being neutral , " declared Irwin L Kellner , vice-president and economist of the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company , " without exhorting people very much in any of the three fields " that the President stressed ? inflation , recession , and energy " In and of itself , " said Walter Heller in a telephone interview , the Ford program does little about inflation , and even less about deepening recession " Dr Heller , a prominent figure at President Ford 's recent two-day economic summit and a former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Kennedy , said , " The centerpiece was missing " " I do not think the United States is in a recession , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he added , " early in 1975 we will have some meaningful reduction in inflation " Mr Ford appeared to reject Criticism that his economic program was not designed to restort- , the II S economy to balance The President defended his 5 percent surtax proposal , stressing that it would affect only 28 percent of U.S taxpayers , and would he a " more equitable approach to giving relief to those hard hit " by inflation than other suggested measures , such as a gasoline tax He said that a family of four with a gross income of $20,000 would pay only $42 in extra tax ? " 12 cents a day " He defined " centerpiece , " in part , as a tough program to curb wages and prices , which in his view , are turning " special sector " inflation into " wage-price inflation " The President 's program , commented Joseph A Pechman , director of economic studies at the Brookings Institution , is " very disappointing " Mr Ford still is " practicing that old-time religion " ( fiscal and monetary restraint ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a " very modest ' ' way In sum , said Mr Pechman , the President did not present an effective " anti-inflation or anti-recession program " Specifically , said Dr. Heller , who is now at the University of Minnesota , Mr Ford should have strengthened the new Council on Wage and Price Stability , by giving it at least delaying powers over wage and price in-creases " If you do not inject some real wage and price restraint , " Dr. Heller said , " then you have to depend on fiscal and monetary restraint . " President Ford promised , in his address , to trim at least $5 billion from the current $305 4 billion federal budget ( fiscal restraint ) and said that " prudent monetary restraint ( limitations on credit and money supply ) are essential " Real output of the economy , which has declined so far this year , will continue to " drop for the next two or three quarters , " he said . At this stage , he said , " I am in favor of net // *Economists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ federal spending to pump vitality into hard-hit sectors of . the economy , rather than less spending , as promised by President Frod and backed by Treasury Secretary William E. Simon , Mr. Frod 's chief economic spokesman . Mr. Kellner , a banking economist , feels by contrast that Mr. Ford is " on the right track " in trying to " exandd supplies and curb demand , " but did not go far enough in his anti-inflaiton proposals . An excise tax on gasoline and other consumer goods , specifically ruled out by the President , would ? in Mr. Kellner 's view ? depress demand for specific products , encourage savings , and generate more tax revenue than Mr. Ford 's 5 percent surtax proposal . Type of tax argued A surtax , remarked Mr. Kellner , dampens consumer spending in general by taking funds away from millions of Americans , whereas excise taxes would allow families to choose between saving their money or buying highly taxed goods . Rather than opt for a 5 percent surtax , said Mr. Pechman , which strikes hardest at the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax loopholes now favoring rich individuals and corporations . " The American people , " said Mr. Kellner , " are ready to rise to the occasion , if they are given the leadership . " He suggested , for example , that the President should propose a " massive recycling program , " in which communities would collect for re-use everything from used crankcase oil to tin cans , paper , and " even cut grass " for compost . " The American people , " commented Dr. Heller in similar vein , " would have taken much more ? would have responded " to a sterner presidential call to sacrifice .
