txt // Representative Gerald Ford of Michigan , House minority leader ? I endorse the Urban Mass Transportation Assistance Act of 1970 as recommended by President Nixon . The need for this legislation is beyond question.110 Clearly , in one of the strange twists of politics , mass transportation had become a safe issue . Supporting transit helped the poor and the not-so-poor in cities large and small . Plain people and influential people around the country , carrying all shades of political opinion and in both political parties , at last came to realize the importance of aid to mass transportation in the urban twentieth-century United States . Interests usually considered as competing with transit , such as the highway lobby , came to realize that their bread , too , was buttered in part with the mass transportation issue and that they had to lend their support or lose the vital backing of powerful , big-city politicians ? and even small-city politicians ? in getting the highway trust fund renewed in 1972 . After almost ten years , the mass transportation programs of the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary to do a decent job . The sums involved were still small , considering the magnitude of the task , which meant that the work of the coalition was far from over . Highway Act of 1973 Intense lobbying effort was mounted by the mass transportation coalition beginning in 1971 . There were two goals for this effort . The first was to gain support for legislation that would provide federal operating subsidies for mass transportation . This move was strongly opposed by the Nixon administration . The administration 's stated position was that operating subsidies were financially unsound and lacked the necessary incentives to push transit management to do a better job of serving the public without massive , bureaucratic butting-in on the local level by the Urban Mass Transportation Administration . The principal unspoken reason for opposition was concern that organized transit labor would make off with most of the subsidy by means of high wage demands . The second goal , the campaign for which was launched in early 1972 , was to split off some of the Highway Trust Fund money for mass transportation purposes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Both Secretary Volpe and , later , SecreThe // tary Brinegar spoke out on this issue at every opportunity , as did the president . ' 1 ' In the Congress the issue of the Trust Fund was a difficult one , so much so that the Congress was unable to pass a highway bill at all in 1972 . The pro-highway and pro-transit lobbies were about equally balanced , and it was undoubtedly a tender issue in an election year . With the start of the first session of the 93rd Congress , intense efforts were once again made to enact the trust-busting legislation . ' The Senate was first to pass such legislation , but the House bill , while similar in many ways to the Senate bill , did not open the Trust Fund.173 There was a certain element of desperation involved . Many states were almost out of federal highway money as the midpoint of 1973 was reached ? and passed . Unhappily for the highway lobby , the mass transit lobby was strong enough to block passage of a highway act ; compromise was imperative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it meant opening the Highway Trust Fund to mass transportation purposes . In the heat of the summer of 1973 , a conference committee of both houses worked to hammer out an accord . They were successful in reaching a compromise on July 20 , 1973 . The Senate quickly ratified the much-amended legislation.114 On August 3 , 1973 , the House voted 382 to 34 in favor of the conference report on the 1973 Federal Aid Highway Act . The president signed the act into law on August 13 , as Public Law 93-87 . Another major step had been taken to provide increased aid for mass transportation . The urban transportation priorities of the federal government had taken another decisive shift away from the highway orientation that so marked the period after the Second World War . Indeed , some observers noted that mass transit aid was the fastest growing of all federal programs . The Highway Act of 1973 is certainly not a trumpet blast announcing the arrival of the transit millenium , but it is an indication of strong support for mass transportation improvement in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not just a highway act in the sense of providing passenger transportation by means of the private automobile ; it might better be dubbed a transportation act because of its broad nobility implications in both rural and urban areas . The act also gives the local levels of government much more of a say to determining what sort of transportation system they really wish // to have ; no longer will local government have to opt for a major highway effort simply because highway funds are available rather than developing mass transit . The act has vital implications for transport improvements . President Nixon put it well in the signing ceremony : This Act is not only a highway act . One of its most significant features is that it allows the Highway Trust Fund to be used for mass transit capital improvements . Under this Act , for the first time , states and localities will have the flexibility they need to set their own transportation priorities . The law will enable them to relieve congestion and pollution problems by developing more balanced transportation systems where that is appropriate rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make such problems even worse.its The Highway Act of 1973 actually continues the process of allowing the Highway Trust Fund to be opened up for purposes other than the construction of highways . The 1970 Highway Act contained a modest provision that permitted monies earmarked for the Interstate , Urban System , and Urban Extension funds to be used in the construction of transit support facilities . Under the 1970 Act such items as exclusive or preferential bus lanes , traffic control devices , bus passenger loading areas and facilities , shelters , fringe area parking , and transportation corridor parking facilities could be built to serve bus and other public transportation passengers . However , the value of this provision was limited in that the funds expended for mass transportation purposes could not exceed those that would have been spent in conventionally providing highway capacity . Under the 1973 Act this restriction no longer applies , and all apportioned highway funds for the various systems can be used for the transit related purposes outlined above , even if the cost of such installations would exceed that of a conventional highway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that help make it much more than just highway legislation . Besides opening the Highway Trust Fund , the 1973 . Act provides another $3 billion in contract authority for mass transportation under the provisions of the 1970 Act ; these funds are , of course , in addition to any transit money from the Highway Trust Fund . The 1973 Act also brought about an increase in the proportion of federal aid from two thirds of the net project cost of a mass transportation capital grant project up to a mandatory 80 per cent for all projects administratively reserved // after July 1 , 1973 . Furthermore , at the direction of the secretary of transportation , transit planning may receive federal funding up to 100 per cent of the project cost . The gradual opening of the Highway Trust Fund to transit use is the obvious product of compromise ; the highway interests have by no means had the rug pulled out from under them in an unseemly manner . Indeed , the more ardent transit supporters can fault the 1973 Act as proceeding too slowly in using the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inevitable judgment on all compromises . In any event , in fiscal year 1974 cities may choose to use their share of the Highway Trust Fund 's $800 million Urban Systems ' road apportionment for the construction of fixed mass transit facilities or the purchase of buses or equipment for rail transit . However , in fiscal 1974 the money will come from the general fund of the United States , and an offsetting amount will be kept in the Highway Trust Fund for highway use . For example , if local officials choose to invest in a mass transit improvement in place of a highway project , after approval of the secretary of transportation , 70 per cent of the cost of the transit project will be paid from federal general funds . Urban System highway funds apportioned to the particular state would be reduced by an amount equal to the federal expenditure on the transit project . The situation changes in fiscal year 1 975 , when up to $200 million ? one quarter of the amount of the Trust Fund money earmarked for urban highway systems ? may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that year the Trust Fund money can be used only for bus-related projects . The use of the Trust Fund is broadened in fiscal year 1976 , when cities will have the freedom , if they so choose , to tap the Trust Fund for the whole of the $800 million Urban Systems fund for mass transportation purposes and may use the bonds for rail as well as bus-related capital projects . The decision to use Highway Trust Fund money for mass transportation is in the hands of local officials . They may use money as they choose within certain broad limits . It must be recognized that the 1973 Act does not require that expenditures be made for mass transportation purposes ; it merely permits the action . Possibly no more than $50 to $100 million of the potential $800 million available in fiscal 1976 is likely to he spent for transit purposes at the // option of local government . Urban highway construction is not stopped . Cities , working together with their state governments , are also allowed to trade money from the Highway Trust Fund earmarked for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an equal amount of general fund money for mass transit . In order to accomplish this switch , the governor of a state and local government officials must make a joint request to the secretary of transportation for approval of the deletion . The secretary can withdraw his approval of a portion of the Interstate , if the segment is not to be replaced by a toll road in the same corridor or if the segment is not essential to the integrity of the over-all interstate system . Local officials may then give notice to the state highway department that local needs require , in place of the Interstate segmcnt , construction of a rail transit line or the purchase of bus or rail equipment . If the state highway department determines that the transit project fits in with the comprehensive transportation plan for the urban area , it may then be submitted once again to the secretary of transportation for approval . Approval by the secretary obligates the federal government to pay to the local area a sum not above the expected cost of the withdrawn Interstate highway segment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a maximum of 80 per cent of the net project cost . The mileage withdrawn from an urban segment of the Interstate in one state may be applied to modification of the Interstate System in any other state . Interstate funds equal to the amount apportioned for the withdrawn segment are deducted from the withdrawing state 's apportionment of Interstate Highway money . The 1973 Act contains other facets that strengthen the role of the cities in the realm of urban transportation . States are required to allocate a portion of the Urban Systems highway funds authorization among urban areas of 200,000 population or more , thus assuring all cities of some size of at least a modest chunk of the money . Previously , each state government had total discretion on the allocation of road money within its borders . Furthermore , highway funds may be allocated directly to metropolitan planning agencies for transportation planning , without going through the state . These funds are over and above the planning and research funds already avail able to cities before the passage of the 197 1 Act . // Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1973 as it wore its way to a final compromise . Rural areas and intercity transportation needs were not ignored ; $12 billion was assured in the act in the 1974 ? 1976 period for the Interstate System and rural primary and secondary roads . Bicycle transportation was given some significant aid . Up to $40 million per year may be utilized from highway funds to aid in the construction of bicycle paths in con junction with highway projects . These pathways need not be constructed in the highway right-of-way . Pedestrian walkways may also he constructed ; the funds for both bikeways and pedestrian ways are to come from money apportioned for the urban and rural Primary Systems and the Urban System . The Highway Act of 1973 takes action to augment rural mobility beyond merely providing roadways . Rural transit demonstration programs are encouraged as a means of increasing the mobility of persons in rural areas who do not have access to private automobiles . Funds amounting to $30 million in fiscal 1975 and $20 million in fiscal 1976 are to be taken from the Highway Trust Fund for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Funds may be used for capital purposes , both equipment and facilities , in support of these demonstrations , as well as to cover the demonstration research and operating costs . The act also includes some provisions that restrict mass transit operating agencies . All equipment purchased for capital or other project purposes must meet the standards for emissions and noise under the Clean Air Act and the Noise Control Act . Furthermore , federal capital aid for buses will not be provided without an agreement on the part of the local public transit agency that it will not engage in charter operation in competition with private bus operators outside the area in which a given local public transportation agency provides regularly scheduled transit service . Local public transit agencies must also agree not to operate school bus service in competition with private school bus operators . This provision does not apply if private operators are unable to offer adequate , safe transportation of school children at reasonable cost . School children may , of course , be carried as a part of regular transit operation , either at regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these regulations to protect private enterprise , failure to comply with these rules means that a transit agency will not be eligible for future // federal funds . This regulation does not apply if a transit agency has been operating charter or school services in the twelve months prior to the passage of the 1973 Act . A new requirement for mass transportation under the 1973 Act may cause transit operating agencies some grief . If federal assistance is requested for mass transit , the secretary of transportation must be assured that transit projects receiving federal financial aid can be effectively used by elderly and handicapped persons . No one quite knows what this provision really means . Does it mean that such persons are to be given precisely the same access to transit service as the general public , or does it mean that they may be served by some sort of auxiliary service such as dial-a-bus or some other form of demand-responsive system ? Providing such service , regardless of whether it is through the entire system or by means of special services , is likely to be highly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapid transit system being constructed in the Washington , D.C. , metropolitan area by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transportation Authority ( WMATA ) . Under the Highway Act , WMATA must provide access to all Washington Metro rapid transit stations for the handicapped and the aged . This means , for the most part , that elevators must be included in all rapid transit stations . Under the provisions of the Highway Act , the federal share of this installation is to be $65 million . What the long-run cost of such services would be across the nation is probably not calculable at this time , especially if it means that all transit facilities and vehicles must be equipped to meet the special needs of the aged and handicapped . The implications are worrisome , if , for example , all buses had to be accessible for persons in wheelchairs ; no standard bus now made could comply ? the doors and aisles are too narrow . Many rapid transit cars now in use might also fail to comply . The idea of a transit trust fund is not quashed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Highway Trust Fund for transit use . Indeed , the Highway Act raises the funding issue again . The act instructs the secretary of transportation to cooperate with the governor of each state , as well as with local officials , in making an evaluation of the mass transit element of the 1972 National Transportation Report based on the Transportation Needs Study conducted in 1971 . The mass transport requirements are to he re viewed carefully and a program developed to meet the transit needs // existing in each urban area . The capital investment requirements and the operating and maintenance costs for the mass transit system programs are to be determined along with an appraisal of the financial resources available for transit on all levels of government . The secretary of transportation must then study various revenue mechanisms , such as a tax on fuels used in mass transit service , or an additional gasoline tax imposed in urban areas that might be used to finance mass transportation activities . The magnitude of the potential sources of user tax revenues is to be investigated along with the rates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanisms for collection of taxes and the potential impact on transit usage caused by such taxes are also to be subject to study . The secretary is obliged to report on this matter to the Congress no later than 180 days after enactment of the Highway Act . This means that a recommendation for a transit trust fund or at least some other major source of revenue for public mass transportation is not at all unlikely in 1974.116 The authorizations under the 1973 Highway Act from which the various sums for mass transportation as well as highway related purposes will be withdrawn are shown in Table 1 ? 2:1 7 Table The new UMTA contract authority for fiscal years 1974 to 1976 is $3 billion . The Department of Transportation appropriations bill for fiscal year 1974 included almost a billion dollars for mass transportation . The breakdown is as follows : Capital Facilities grains , 8 8 Urban Mass Transportation $872,000,000 ; Technical Studies , $37,600,000 ; Research , Development and Demonstrations , $68,950,000 ; Administrative Expense , $7,000,000 ; total , $985,550,000.11 Just how much the Highway Act of 1973 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult to say . It is certainly no great financial bonanza as regards tapping the Highway Trust Fund . At the moment , only a fraction of the $1 billion of Trust Fund money that might be used for transit in fiscal years 1975 and 1976 is likely to be utilized . As things stand now , the substitution of transit for urban segments of the Interstate system is apt to be a more fruitful source of new transit money . The important thing is that the Highway Trust Fund as a sacred cow is no more . The mechanism that inevitably assured highway construction , whether or not it was the most desirable approach to the solution of mobility problems , has been dismantled and an opening wedge for transit purposes in the future . It is certainly good , considering the need , that more money for transit is to be available . More responsibility for the use of the funds is thrust upon the cities , since it is at their option ? given the cooperation of the states ? that money can be diverted from highway use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no guarantee that the funds will be used wisely . The 1973 Act is complicated , and interpretation is still uncertain ; the pathway to implementation of a transit project is likely to be strewn with red tape . The Highway Act contains no provision for federal operating subsidies for mass transit . Ever since the issue was raised , both DOT and UMTA were firm in their opposition to such a program . However , with the energy shortage of the winter of 1973-1974 , the Nixon administration reevaluated its position and began a push for what amounted to an urban transportation revenue sharing program that would give cities an option on spending block grants of federal money for capital or operating purposes . No action had been taken at the time of this writing . In the longer run , the requirement of the 1973 Act that the DOT secretary investigate alternate sources of funding for transit on all levels of government may serve to solve this need , which arises at present because of local jurisdictional and revenue problems . ' ' The heyday of the private automobile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desirability of improvement of muss transportation in the cities is now firmly entrenched in the United States . The idea of // publicly owned and subsidized mass transport is no longer foreign . By all signs the nation is on the brink of major transit activity . Making real progress will depend to a great extent upon the vigor and dedication of local government armed with the will to make mass transportation a useful servant of the community . CHAPTER TWO Mass Transportation : Pro and Con Introduction The previous chapter has outlined the growth of federal policy toward urban mass transportation . Before examining the institutions involved and reviewing the effects of the federal mass transportation programs , it appears wise to devote some attention to a basic question : Will people use mass transportation ? In other words , the federal approach , albeit limited until recently by microscopic budgets ( from 1961 through 1970 , $1 billion for transit , $41 billion for highways ) , is by typical federal standards based mainly on the notion that improvements in mass transportation will attract riders to transit and help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States . A question not asked frequently until recent years is " Do people need mass transportation ? " This , in part , reflects the rediscovery of the poor in the mid-1960s and the finding that not all Americans had regular access to an automobile . As the reader will recall , the original rationale for mass transit improvement centered mainly on the problems of traffic congestion and the use of transit to shift people out of their cars as a means of providing relief from traffic jams . The " shifting " rationale is associated more with the quality of transit than anything else . In other words , only transit service of quality approaching or surpassing the automobile would he effective in at 90 // tracting patrons . The " need " argument is more closely related to provision of mass transportation service for those without an alternative means of mobility . It is obvious that bringing about any major improvements in miss transportation is a formidable task , given the history of industry decline stretching back the better part of a half century . ( ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States situation as follows : 1 . Unless distances are long , transit speeds and service frequencies high , car speeds low and parking difficulties considerable , it is difficult to attract car commuters to public transport . 2 . Because of this , public transport users tend to be people who have no car available , whether or not the family owns one . 3 . Service frequency is more important than lower fare levels or proximity to public transport routes in attracting people to public transport . 4 . The discovery of successful public transport systems involves considerable risk , costs and controversy , particularly when fixed costs are high and the capital irretrievably sunk.l Regardless of whether mass transport is to solve the vexations of affuence or of poverty , many concerned persons feel strongly that more and better mass transport will cure many ills , or at least must be included as a critical part of the prescription for urban health . In a broad sense , improvement in the quality of urban life , which means the life of most Americans , is the desired end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since 1961 there is no doubt that the vocal positions of various administrations in power in Washington have been for a strong commitment to mass transportation . Under Presidents Kennedy and Johnson this commitment was not matched with the necessary money to do the job at hand . While the Nixon administration has not always followed through on its positions on transit , the over-all thrust of the administration has been for increasingly larger expenditures for mass transportation . ' Gone , too , at least for the moment , are the days of even token opposition to the notion of federal aid to mass transit . As noted in Chapter 1 , whatever opposition there is to mass transportation comes from the highway lobby , which is not so much opposed to aid for transit as it was to the use of highway Trust Fund money for nonhighway purposes. : // Even though the battle of general attitudes toward transit seems won in Washington for the present , there are still arguments against mass transportation or against certain forms of transit . For the sake of completeness , both sides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the arguments both for and against mass transport will be held up for inspection . Heat , Light , and the Mass Transit Issue At first blush there is , to be sure , a certain challenge in being promass transport . As a mass transit advocate , one has the somewhat masochistic pleasure of supporting what has been for many years the underdog . In some circles it has even become fashionable to downgrade private transportation by means of the automobile and see almost incredible virtue in the stoic rider of mass transportation . Considering the quality of mass transportation in most United States cities , virtue may be its own reward . Nevertheless , it is indeed quite legitimate to question whether or not it is a waste of time to attempt to resuscitate mass transport . The critic of the pro-mass transport position can ask some sticky questions . Might time and resources be better spent on providing improved private transportation through highway betterments or , perhaps , increasing the supply of parking in downtown areas ? Perhaps the resources being allocated toward improving mass transportation might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for education , improving mental health , aiding mentally retarded children , or a host of other worthy projects ? These questions can not be answered objectively because of the difficulty of valuing the output of the various programs . Perhaps an even thornier question is , " Why try to beat the dead horse of mass transit back into life ; has n't the public already voted strongly in favor of the private automobile ? " Admittedly , the public glee at the unveiling of new auto models goes on practically unabashed , somewhat akin to the feeling of little boys in times past when they were presented with the Lionel Train catalog just before Christmas . There is widespread agreement that new highways are good things , although many may quibble over site and amenities . Likewise , few people are made glum over the thought of more park ing space . In shoal , the automobile and its accoutrements have a generally happy position in the public favor . // Recently the auto-highway euphoria has somewhat dimmed , primarily as a result of the interest and concern over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prospect of a loin ' term shortage of energy resources , and the dismaying results of trying to build major chunks of the Interstate System through high IN populated urban areas . The realization that many citizens without cars are marooned in immobility is another recent phenomenon . For instance , who would have dreamed even as late as the mid- 1960 's that a governor of Massachusetts ? in this case Francis W. Sargent ? would describe the expressway system in the Boston area as chains to imprison the city and would propose a freeze on the number of parking spaces in downtown Boston to encourage the use of mass transit ? Likewise , across the border in Canada , William Davis , premier of the Province of Ontario , has been the leader of a government that has scotched the Spadina Expressway in Toronto on the ground that it and other major highways precluded a human scale of life . The government of the province is pushing for great expansion of mass transit systems within Ontario , ' rather than continued expansion of and reliance upon the highway system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its shortcomings , that the automobile delivers a very high quality level of services . ' More pointed is the question : " Can mass transit do the job it is supposed to ? " This gets back to the issue raised earlier as to whether or not people will use mass transportation if it is provided . Indeed , will mass transportation effectively relieve urban traffic congestion , make urban life better , preserve amenities , provide the needed mobility so that the ghetto poor may find employment , strengthen downtown , and a host of other things which are often claimed for it ? Furthermore , when inspecting the idea of mass transportation on a pro and con basis , the observer is apt to run into intense and conflicting arguments between pro-automobile and pro-mass transit advocates . Unfortunately , far more heat than light is usually generated by these debates . Any attempt to put the pro and con arguments in perspective will probably not do much to lower the temperature of the arguments . More than likely , those holding positions either for or against mass transit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One point should be made , however . The decision to improve mass transportation , or to make major investment or pro vide operating subsidies for transit , is essentially a local matter If // a given urban public , through its elected officials , expresses the wish that money be spent and improvements be made , then the desires of the public have to be carried out as a part of the political process . Criticism from outside the given city and even sophisticated economic theory and analysis would have to provide ironclad , irrefutable opposing arguments in such a situation , once the public has expressed its will . The arguments pro and con mass transit are too often viewed as an " either-or " situation of limited transportation alternatives rather than as an attempt to increase the traveler 's choice . Overly staunch advocates of mass transit often take a position as follows : " Instead of wasting X number of dollars on highways that do n't solve anything , we will invest that same sum in new buses or rail rapid transit and bring an end to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unbridled use of the private automobile . " Highway hyper-advocates will take the stand that : " The automobile is the most desirable means of urban transport the world over ; to attempt to foster other modes of urban transport is not only a waste of good money but it flies in the face of public opinion and is in direct opposition to what the public really wants and needs . Every available dollar should be pumped into provision for the needs of the private automobile . " In such headbutting , the only public result is a headache . Often the heat is generated in the clash between highway and rail mass transit advocates rather than from those advocating improvements in mass transport in general . The highway forces , realizing that rail construction is a matter involving large sums of money , have been threatened at seeing the federal Highway Trust Fund tapped to pay for new or improved rail facilities . Congress passed legislation to that effect in 1973 . As a result , road advocates usually pull out all the stops of ridicule , invective , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the highway exchequer . Rail advocates , on the other hand , often make an argument too strongly in their favor in order to downgrade the possible effective ness of highways ; clearly , they hope to shift considerable suers into their rail bailiwick . In truth , even if there are as many as thirty or forty cities that can justify and use rail mass transit and this k a matter of some reasonable doubt in the foreseeable future there are hundreds of urban areas that will need improved mass transportation by means other than rail . To state the argument only in tems // of rail versus highway is therefore to narrow it unduly and obscure the broad issue of enhancing mobility in urban areas by a variety of means . ' Perhaps the best question to ask regarding mass transportation is whether or not , given some encouragement and substantial improve ment in service , it will be possible to increase the mobility of the population ( or at least keep present standards of mobility from declining ) and to perform this chore , in league with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heart of the urban trans port issue is the nubby problem of mobility and what must be sacrificed to keep American society moving . Closely associated is the matter of those modifications of urban form resulting from the means of transportation investment chosen . It is a matter of either continuing the pattern of highway-oriented sprawl which symbolizes most American urban places today , or preserving ? or increasing ? a certain amount of urban clustering supported and served by mass transit , if such clustering is more economic or otherwise more desirable than other alternatives . Pandora 's box is opened wide when this issue is raised because honest men can and have debated hotly on whether or not the sprawled or clustered city is best . ' Perhaps the teal focus should be on what may best be called affordable mobility . That is , the means for any citizen to move about easily in an urban area should be available to him at a cost reasonable both to the traveler and to society . Again , the ground is touchy ; " reasonable " cost and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this point a bit further , the concept of affordable mobility may be a wise approach since it links cost with mobility . From our beginnings as a nation the issue of mobility in the United States has been solved in a manner typical to our society : private interest and private profit have always had priority over the public interest . It is hardly news that this system has worked well in that many persons in our society have prospered ; the great bulk of the United States population has a high private standard of living . Nevertheless , our public living standard is low ? witness the standards of health , education , housing , mental care , transportation , to name a few , when it is public health , public education , public housing , public mental care , or public transportation . The issue ? and the contrast is sharpened when one relates the standards of public services to our vast national wealth and finds disturbing extremes .

This is especially true when the absence of such ireful planning may impose intolerable public burdens such as exnsivc use of automobiles with resulting air pollution . The concept ' affordable mobility would also involve thinking on those forms of ansport that are less costly for society to build , tolerate , and use . is in this latter sense that the federal government and other levels government have fostered the notion that mass transport must he suscitated because we can not do otherwise .

Moreover , it has been // strengthened in recent years by adding to the argument two important related points : increased choice of travel means and more equal physical mobility for all members of American society . The argument for mass transport , in its primeval form , ran along lines somewhat as follows : " Automobile congestion is intolerable and expensive ; if we can get people out of their cars and into mass transit , we can reduce congestion at lower cost to the taxpayer titan building new highways . " Such thinking is , of course , oriented to the middle class and is couched in terms of transit as a substitute for the automobile to be used by those who had a car . It reflected the fears of city fathers that our cities would be inundated and finally choked by automotive traffic . However , this argument neglects those too old , too young , or too poor to afford an automobile or to drive an automobile safely . It also ignores those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even a third and fourth ) needed to provide mobility for all members of the family in areas unnerved by mass transportation . ' 0 The recent interest in civil rights and social justice and increasing public awareness of the spectrum of unmet needs have focused attention on social objectives for transit . This awareness was heightened in the late 1960 's by the sharp counterpoint of riots and other disasters in our cities : many people otherwise blind to minority problems have come to see that mass transportation has value beyond mitigating urban traffic jams . Special emphasis has been given in recent years to the needs of elderly and handicapped persons who often can not use an automobile even if it is available . Studies have pointed up the serious lack of mobility suffered by these unfortunate citizens . The Urban Mass Transportation Administration has adopted a policy of providing funds for demonstrations of special services and equipment for the old and the handicapped . Moreover , the federally aided transit technical study projects require that consideration be given to these groups , and equipment development projects have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the not-so-spry ; particular attention is also being paid to provisions for the nonambulatory . " As mentioned in Chapter 1 , the Highway Act of 1973 requires the transit needs of the elderly and handicapped to be met . In general , the case for mass transportation has been made on the basis of its potential passenger capacity , the possibility of conserving valuable space , preservation of social and economic values , // and in the cost savings possible through increased use of mass transportation . Let us take these up one at a time . Capacity A major point made by advocates of mass transportation is that a principal problem in urban transport is the limited carrying capacity of streets and highways as used by the private automobile . The superior capability of a given space devoted to transit ? either by bus or by rail ? in providing increased passenger carrying capacity is indeed an important facet of mass transport . Figures typically somewhat similar to those shown in Table 2 ? 1 usually reveal that , at worst , highways range from around 750 passengers per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freeways up to a happier figure of about 1,200 on city streets and 4,000 on freeways , depending upon the average number of passengers per vehicle . Buses , on the low side of their capacity , range from 2,250 up to 4,500 persons when used only on regular city streets , and from 9,000 to 18,000 when used on freeways . Various sorts of rail rapid transit capacities range from 12,000 to 21,600 where six-car trains are used on a three-minute headway ( headway is the scheduled time span between vehicles ) all the way up to 40,000 to 72,000 per hour where ten-car trains operating on a ninety-second headway are provided . There is little to argue with in terms of sheer capacity ; mass transit has it all over private transportation when it comes to effective utilization of space . The successful functioning of the nation 's very large cities , such as New York , Chicago , Boston , or Philadelphia , where considerable demands are placed on travel arteries , cries out for means of transportation possessing substantial capacity ; mass transportation fits these needs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without rail rapid transit and commuter railway service . Table 2 ? 2 shows data for some selected cities and indicates the number of persons entering downtown areas during an average day , and the type of transport mode for peak-hour inbound and outbound flows . As would be expected , the larger cities attract sizable numbers of persons and a considerable number of these are carried by mass transport : this fact is especially true during the hours of peak movement . The rapid transit and commuter railway services account for the bulk of persons moved by Mass transit during peak periods in // those cities possessing such services . Moreover , even cities without rapid transit show a fairly high percentage of mass transit use during hours of peak travel . Admittedly , however , if mass transportation is to alleviate congestion and augment mobility , the important point is not the capacity of the mode involved , but whether or not the mode or service offered will incite utilization . In other words , if traffic is jammed up on existing highways , the provision of a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not necessarily do much to alleviate the traffic jam if the new line is not located in a place where potential patrons have convenient access . Even given convenient access at both origin and destination point , will the other features of mass rapid transit be sufficiently attractive to entice people to leave their cars at home ? Furthermore , is the service such that it substantially expands the real level of mobility throughout the com-munity ? The matter of prime importance is , therefore , the capacity that will actually be used to help alleviate congestion and to increase the mobility of the population . This is mostly a marketing question , assuming no coercion or deception is used to shift auto users to mass transportation . Unfortunately , as noted before , the industry lacks good marketing procedures . Proper location of routes , service quality , pricing , and understanding of the attitudes and needs of the transit consumer , or potential consumer , are necessary to gain better utilization of capacity . Conservation of Space A second argument in favor of mass transport is that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a corollary of the first . Space conservation is an important factor in cities if one considers the congestion of various " facilities " competing for limited space particularly in downtown parts of metropolitan areas . Buildings are built up rather than out , as everyone knows , because downtown land is expensive . It is strictly a matter of using a given space more intensively . Downtown property values have fluctuated considerably over the years . According to some experts , the generalization can probably be made that allowing for inflation values are lower now than they were 50 to 70 years ago . This is due not only to competition for // use from suburban areas , but also because in many cities land values were raised to undue heights in the late nineteenth and early twen-tieth centuries by uninhibited speculation . Values are now coming to reflect more realistic considerations of worth . ' Even so , down-town property values tend to be the highest in any given city . One striking feature of downtown districts is their small size rela-tive to the city they serve . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? say , from a population of 7,500 to 550,000 the Central Business District will grow only five times in size , from 0.1 to 0.5 square miles . " The size of the central business districts of a number of American cities is shown in Table 2-3 . Only a few have central business dis-tricts as large as one mile square . Not shown on the list is New York City , which shares with London the distinction of possessing a central business district of more than nine square miles.14 Despite the small area involved , in many central business districts it appears that somewhere between 40 and 50 per cent of the area is devoted to streets and parking.15 With land values relatively high and space limited , it seems sensible to use land as efficiently as possible ; undue amounts of space should not be used for transport and vehicle storage , if the best use is to be made of valuable land . Mass transit is a means to fill the hill . For instance , a good argument can he made for using buses on // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perhaps nothing more than reserved bus lanes on a conventional street ? as a way of getting more use out of existing space . As can be noted from Table 2 ? 1 , even a modest number of buses operating only at fair frequency can move a substantially higher number of people per highway lane than can private automobiles.l " Rapid transit , with its greater capacity , is even more economical in terms of space needed to handle large numbers . Moreover , transit vehicles need not be stored in scarce downtown space . One way of viewing the space-conserving capabilities of transit is to translate peak-hour mass transit patronage into automobile passengers and then calculate the number of extra lanes of highway necessary to handle the traffic . This is done in Table 2 ? 4 , which utilizes and combines some of the information from 2 ? 1 and 2 ? 2 . The number of peak-hour transit patrons in the non-rapid-transit cities of l3altiniorc , Dallas , Los Angeles , Louisville , and St. Louis is a key factor . It is assumed that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transit patrons would continue to journey into the central business district , but would travel by automobile at a density of 1.5 persons per car . The number of cars needed to handle this demand and the number of lanes required ? depending upon the type of highway ? are indicated in the table . In essence , Table 2 ? 4 shows that without transit , Baltimore , for example , would have to find room for from fifteen to twenty more lanes of ordinary streets , or from six to eight lanes of freeway ; St. Louis would need twelve to sixteen more lanes of street or five to six more freeway lanes , and so on . Part of the cost of a loss of transit patronage would be a sharp increase in space needed for roads , not only downtown , but on the approaches to the central business district as well . Private property needed to expand the roadway system would be removed from the tax rolls , of course . If more persons out of a given number entering the downtown center used mass transit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is unlikely that there would be any sudden , dramatic increase in the amount of space devoted to nontransport use in the central business district . Indeed , while reduced need for street capacity to move traffic might lead to the eventual construction of pedestrian shopping malls or other hits of beautification and rejuvenation , it is more likely that , over time , the lessened demand for // parking might be the more potent force at work , and parking lots might be converted to new uses . No doubt the chief immediate beneficiaries of increased space would be the motorists facing reduced congestion . Of course , if fixed transit facilities , such as a rapid transit system , are installed , there is likely to be substantial new construction in the vicinity of the stations . The real estate involved would be more valuable and would yield greater tax revenues to the municipality . The relatively new subway in Toronto sparked a building boom along its route that is alleged to put more into the public coffers in taxes than was spent on construction . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street in San Francisco was touched off by the building of the Bay Area Rapid Transit System . " A related argument is that parking space may be located away from the central business district or other concentrated activity areas if improved mass transportation is available for the remainder of the journey . An individual who leaves his car at home and takes the bus or train to work is providing parking space outside the central business district . Driving to the end of a commuter railway line or express bus line and depositing a car at that location rather than taking it downtown is another example . In either case , lower value land is utilized for automobile storage . Another aspect of space conservation is the argument often made that if people would use mass transit , there would be less need for expensive public facilities ? such as highways or public parking garages ? that remove property from the tax rolls . This is a good point because if a highway is built in a high value area , as it must be in order to reach the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will suffer from attrition and a greater tax burden will be placed upon remaining property owners . Public parking garages located downtown have also removed some highly valuable land from the tax rolls , although one can argue that the increased access to nearby buildings given by location of public parking facilities increases or maintains the value of that property and thereby maintains or perhaps increases the downtown taxables . Even where downtown parking space is not publicly owned , parking is generally considered a lower value use of property than is a conventional building . The land so used is usually taxed at a lower rate , although this situation may change . Obviously , in this age of rising costs , // cities are vitally concerned with getting every dollar of taxes that they can muster out of property within their borders . This is one of the compelling factors that has apparently helped to persuade city fathers that improved mass transit is not a quaint nineteenth-century idea . Preservation of Values This is an argument that is often closely connected with the preceding section . It hinges on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an aesthetic sense than a ten-lane superhighway . This is a particular favorite with planners trained as architects who are aghast to see the already paltry aesthetics of American cities swept away by what many see to be grotesque ribbons of freeways . Moreover , the sensitivities of the planners are not the only ones touched by the shattering visual and physical impact of a large highway development in a highly urbanized area . The objection of the general public to massive road development in San Francisco and New Orleans is well known . Indeed , the San Francisco Board of Supervisors is unequivocal in its position that no new freeways will be built in that city until the rather ghastly Embarcadero Freeway ? which cuts off the view of the historic Ferry Building from Market Street ? is torn down . " R More to the point , and perhaps the real reason for the growing discontent with the highway program in a nation not generally known for its interest in things aesthetic , is the realization that the highways have not done one of the important things they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legitimately open to scorn on several levels . At the least , increased use of mass transportation ? although there is sometimes a tendency to put it on an either-or basis in relation to highways ? provides hope for a less messy way out of traffic jams than the addition of still more roads . Moreover , beyond the problems of aesthetic blight ecologists are dismayed at the impact of the private automobile on the biosphere . Automotive exhaust emissions are perhaps the most serious single cause of pollution associated with transportation , but noise pollution from large-scale highways is another serious matter . There is even concern over the runoff of salt and other chemicals used for control of ice and snow on highways in cold climates . The National En vironmental Policy Act of 1969 , " which became effective on January I. 1970 , is a federal response to some of these problems . Given // proper enforcement , this act might help develop major improvement in the environment . There is evidence , however , that highway interests are mounting a strong campaign to weaken portions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing must stand in the way of building more roads . It can be argued that improved highways have indeed provided some relief.21 Travel times are generally less today in many cities than they were in the days before the superhighway . Moreover , commuting in the private automobile is almost always faster than by transit . Indeed , as noted earlier , one of the major reasons for a program of transit improvement is to reduce travel time and thus make it a more attractive and useful alternative to urban travelers . Despite some debate and carping on visual values and the success of the highway program , they are somewhat peripheral issues ; it will be remembered that the goal of preservation of economic and social values is about as close as we come at present to some stated objectives of national mass transport policy . There is apparently little real doubt the preservation of economic and social values can be aided by improvements in mass transportation ; at the very least , such values will not be impaired by transit improvements . For example , downtown property values @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focal point of the whole urban transport system , regardless of mode , and usually enjoys a high degree of access . In recent years , with the rapid move to the suburbs , downtown business and real estate interests have become increasingly aware of the threat to the values of their property and have often become strong advocates of improved mass transport systems ? particularly one of the forms of rapid transit ? in order to help reinforce the position of the downtown and preserve economic values . This is a typical response of business interests . In his interesting and highly perceptive book , The Private City , Warner points out how downtown business interests in Philadelphia worked diligently in the I1 ) 20 's for the construction of massive public works , principally new subway lines , to improve access to the central business district . " In the late forties and fifties the downtown interests supported freeway building as giving promise of improved access ; more recently it has been transit once again . Whatever the device , the purpose is plainly to find means to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this unless the funds expended on the transport // improvements might have been better spent elsewhere or the costs are excessive for the value received.22 There is , also , the issue of whether or not it is good to take action that promotes greater concentration in the CI3D . In other words , more people in a limited space may have short-run benefits to property owners , downtown business and service organizations , and the tax receipts of the city , but such congestion may continue to erode the quality of urban life . This problem has no easy answer , since no one seems clear on the " goodness " or " badness " of various levels of concentration . Again , congestion and overcrowding arc a function of whether or not areas of high concentration are designed carefully along with associated residential development and redevelopment ; another factor is design of intra-downtown ( or concentration center ) mobility systems tying building and other facilities together in a way that minimizes interpersonal friction . " Improved mass transportation is often discussed in terms of its power in preserving social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which aids in social intercourse and involvement in the community can be beneficial in helping to preserve a spirit of community , a factor critical in what Lawrence Haworth calls " the Good City . " The interactive life is the one that can support the spirit and make life worth living through enhancement of the spirit of community ; however , the institutional structure of a community , including the transportation system , may be such that real interaction or community is difficult or impossible . " Improved transportation of all types can help maintain the value of interaction and community , and the availability of mass transportation as a good travel alternative for those without automobiles will help reverse the process of social fracture that is so widely mourned in the United States today . " Nevertheless , it is certainly too much to expect revivified mass transit to preserve economic and social values all by itself : people may stop shopping downtown not only because it takes too long to get there on the bus ? or parking is too difficult ? but because unperceptive merchants with wretched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; social fragmentation may be more closely related to class differences , desires , and " natural " stratification , rather than to physical travel barriers. ? There are probably no simple answers to such complex human values and social problems . // Cost Savings Mass transportation advocates generally argue that transit is more economical than use of the private auto . Insofar as individuals are concerned , on the basis of strict pecuniary cost ( that is , without calculation of social costs and benefits ) , there are a number of estimates as to what it costs the passenger to travel by means of the various modes of mass transportation and what it may cost him to drive his own automobile . Table 2 ? 5 gives one estimate of the costs . In a somewhat later study The Federal Highway Administration has a persuasive argument for traveling by bus . It calculates that it costs the average motorist 13.55 cents for every mile he drives his standard sized automobile , as compared with the average bus fare of 3.81 cents a mile . " s Certain failings with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be traveling a greater distance than one mile to enjoy the savings shown ; there may be an element of subsidy in both the public and private modes ; and there is the ever-present problem of averaging anything . Regardless of the source of the information , cost comparisons are always suspect because of the pitfalls of averaging ; this is a thence , and a caveat , that will recur subsequently . To harp a bit on ' fable 2-5 , for example , automobile operating costs vary widely as differences arise in the age and condition of the ear , taxes , fees , terrain , and other operating conditions such as speed , road design . and // degree of congestion . Furthermore , the purchase price of new cars varies widely , affecting depreciation cost . The possibility of used-car purchase and depreciation introduces more variation . Except where a car is specifically purchased and used for purposes competitive with a mode of mass transportation , such as commuting to work , a typical family car is used for many different reasons and only outof-pocket costs can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be lower than the cost-per-mile of transit use , or may he perceived as less by the motorist . Moreover , the labor costs of driving a car are often ignored ; even when the " wages " of the driver of a car are calculated , they are associated only with the time of actual travel . On the other hand , transit costs must include a large burden of operatives ' wages paid when no actual work is performed because of labor agreements calling for a full day 's pay when much less than a full eight-hour day is worked . The peaked nature of the demand for urban mass transportation makes such labor cost burdens almost inescapable in mass transportation.2 " The average cost to the patron of public transportation can differ widely , depending upon the distance involved and whether charges are assessed on a flat-fare , zone , or mileage basis . Traveling a long distance under a flat-fare system produces a low average cost per mile , while the cost per mile for a short trip might be very high indeed . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used in commuter railway services , may appear on the surface to be more uniform on a per-mile basis and thus more easily susceptible to generalization and comparative analysis ; yet even here there are wide variations possible if fares are tapered ? that is , if the fare per mile is less as distance increases . Such tapering is a common feature of railway fares . Moreover , discounts are generally given to patrons buying multiple ride and commuter tickets . In the author 's personal experience as a railroad commuter on the Illinois Central in Chicago from Bryn Mawr ( 71st and Jeffrey ) to the Loop , the fare pattern shown in Table 2 ? 6 was in effect in the late 1950 's . Depending upon the type of ticket purchased , the average fare per ride between a pair of commuter stations on the Illinois Central varied from 29 cents to 40 cents and the average fare cost per mile from 2.64 cents to 3.63 cents . Which of them is the average fare cost ? The same situation could he found between many points on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is another game filled with snares , pitfalls , and stumbling blocks . Some idea of the varia-tion possible in cost estimating was discovered by John Leavens in his highly interesting study The Cost of Commuter Transporta-tion . ' " Table 2 ? 7 shows the cost per mile variations , with 1.5 pas-sengers per car based on a number of cost studies . Out-of-pocket costs vary from 1.75 cents to 3 cents per passenger mile ; total costs range from 4.67 cents to 8.84 cents per passenger mile . Leavens picks what appear to be the most reasonable figures and goes on to show the comparative costs of commuting into Manhattan from New Jersey by automobile , bus , and commuter railroad . The rail and bus costs to the traveler are based on actual fares and distances . For the various distances involved , as shown in Figure 2-1 , he finds that when calculating total costs to the traveler , including highway , bridge or tunnel tolls , and parking , on either the out-of-pocket cost or total cost basis , the automobile is by far the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if only out-ofpocket costs are considered and the various tolls and parking fees are ignored , the automobile is almost always the cheapest means of travel . Leavens ' work is considerably more valuable than many such studies . He confines his effort to the specific area of New York City ; he does not attempt to generalize to any great extent . He therefore avoids being absurd . In short , to be as logical and consistent as possible , one must investigate a specific situation to determine whether or not one means of travel is less costly than another . The matter of straightforward cost finding and cost comparison is not helped at all when analysts attempt to reflect social benefits and costs . This involves a whole spectrum of factors that should be weighed in any private or public decision , but factors which are difficult to pin down . For example , the gasoline engine of an auto-mobile produces pollutants that poison the atmosphere ; there is a cost involved , but how much is it and how can it be assessed ? Diesel-powered buses and trucks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do produce considerable smoke and a harmless but unpleasant stench ; how is the cost of smoke and smell to be figured ? Public means of transportation are considerably safer ? in terms of accidents , injuries , and fatalities ? than is the private automobile , but most comparative calculations ignore a cost factor that hinges on the dubious calculus of placing a monetary evaluation on life itself . New highways are often partially justified on the basis of the improvements in safety in terms of reduced slaughter compared to existing roads ; again , the matter hinges on arbitrarily placing value // on human life in dollars and cents . Moreover , such roadways often induce more travel so that the accident level in the absolute may stay the same , or even rise , while the proportion of accidents to vehicle miles , or some other standard , falls . The point of all this is , very simply , that what may be the most important cost factors of all tend to be ignored , or massaged to prove a pet conclusion , hecause they are so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and complete attempt to determine the comparative cost per passenger ( not the fare paid by the passenger , but the cost per passenger of providing the service ) of the various modes of urban transportation is the analysis undertaken by Meyer , Kain , and Wohl.3f ( To sum up the results of their work in a paragraph or two is an unavoidable injustice ; the book should be carefully read by persons interested in urban transport . ) For the line-haul portion of the trip , calculated on a series of comparisons based on a roadway and rail system of radial configuration , it was felt that the automobile was the least costly of the modes as long as distances were short and volumes relatively low ; either bus or rail systems are comparable at higher volumes and longer distances . Express bus systems sharing rights-of-way with automobiles on freeways are , not surprisingly , less costly than rail because the costs of the highway facilities may be shared with the other vehicles using them . Buses sharing freeways may , of course , suffer from the same jams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its attractiveness . Where volume of bus traffic ( or freeway congestion ) makes freeway sharing undesirable , the cost of completely separate highways for buses is at least comparable to that of rail . Since a busway may require a somewhat wider right-of-way than a rail facility , where land acquisition costs are high the expense of constructing a busway may exceed rail construction costs for the fixed way . Rail costs appear to be much more favorable in those situations where rights-of-way are already in place and a relatively modest amount of replacement or new work needs to be done.33 Turning to comparisons of complete systems , including pick-up and delivery in residential areas , the line-haul , and delivery and pick-up in downtown centers , the integrated bus system ( pick-up , line-haul , and delivery by the same vehicle with some express running on the line-haul over exclusive rights-of-way ) seems to have the cost edge . Where volumes in any particular corridor are in the // range of 5,000 to 10,000 or below , the automobile seems to have a cost advantage . Only where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transit appear to offer any cost advantage , and then under conditions where it is operated in conjunction with feeder buses at the residential pick-up and delivery end and with a subway for downtown distribution . Again , an additional edge is given rail when basic facilities , whether utilized for transit service or not , are already in existence.34 This can be ? and often is ? interpreted as concluding that only a very few of the largest cities , or those with facilities already in place , can justify rail rapid transit . It is not surprising that those directly interested in favoring rail rapid transit , as well as others with less reason for bias , have been unhappy with the Meyer , Kain , and Wohl analysis . Indeed , an earlier study by the same authors , which is largely re-presented in The Urban Transportation Problem , drew a sharp reaction and a serious questioning of the veracity of the authors. ; ' Even more cutting was the commentary of a critic who fumed : Not only does this study fail to deal with matters of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it exhibits a partiality toward the bus-automobile mode , as opposed to that of rail mass-transit , so evident and consistent that the reader is slightly embarrassed to note that this very long , one can not say substantial work , was financed by the Ford Foundation . One would have been happier had it been the Ford Motor Company.36 One great and obvious fact lacking in the Meyer , Kain , and Wohl analysis is its failure to come to grips with the costs of accidents and air pollution that are so closely associated with automotiverelated transportation systems and which have loomed large in recent public discussion . Criticism may also be levelled at the unrealistically low pecuniary cost of automobile operations presented . For example , in his study , Leavens notes the small portion of costs Meyer , Kain , and Wohl allocated to gasoline : A brief calculation will show that a gasoline allowance of 0.70 cents per passenger mile for a car carrying one and one-half passengers and using gasoline costing 33 cents per gallon calls for a car capable of 31.5 miles per gallon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the stripped compact or used car of which Meyer , Kain , and Wohl are speaking . Moreover , their assumption of a " utilitarian vehicle " for commuting purposes is certainly not reflected in the types of automobiles seen on the highways during the morning rush . // On the matter of automotive costs Entwistle , also , takes exception : In calculating the comparative cost of commuting by automobile , which is after all the foundation on which this entire work is erected , the extraordinary assumption is made , and made almost parenthetically , that ownership costs ( the largest single component in automobile transit ) , will be reduced to 4 cents a vehicle-mile by one of the following expedients . One will buy a second car specially developed for commuting needs to cost $1,600 and last 12 years in continuous use . Alternatively , one will buy a used car for $200 and drive it continuously for three and a half years : No evidence is advanced to suggest that the driving public is likely to accept such vehicles for the cause of urban economics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the public would not , even if these proposals were feasible.3s Meyer , Kain , and Wohl are not presenting deliberate falsifications ; rather they are trying to generalize on the basis of certain assumptions and averages . ' " Any generalization contains considerable truth and considerable inaccuracy . One need only consider the grotesque average physical makeup of a group of fifty men and fifty women . In any case , the methodology of the study appears impeccable . If it is indeed so , then it should be used in given , reallife situations with whatever slight modifications are necessary to make it more realistic . In short , no generalization of comparative costs can point the true way for all cities at all times under all circumstances . Is mass transit less costly than the private automobile ? The only fair answer is that it all depends . The important point is that ? brushing aside the inevitable " **34;455;TOOLONG " arguments ? mass transportation does indeed have a place that can be justified by cost analysis . The problem still remains whether or not people will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than cost comparisons for the individual user of transport is whether or not mass transportation is less costly than the private automobile to society as a whole in given metropolitan areas . Objective measures are not available . Yet , in the larger urban areas at least , there is a growing feeling that the automobile can not continue to be the dominant mode of transport . Public officials not a had barometer of public feeling ? are coming to believe that the costs to society of the private automobile are beginning to outweigh its benefits . Much of the thinking at the Urban Mass Transportation Administration reflects this posilio , n. " ' // The Case Against Mass Transit A fairly strong case against mass transit can be made on a number of grounds . Many persons contend that mass transportation is unattractive , inflexible , too expensive , and utterly incapable of handling the kind of spread-out population that is now common in United States urban areas . One of the best summaries of the skeptical position on mass transportation is found in a paper by James M. Hunnicutt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parking in Montgomery County , Maryland : Another favorite topic when parking is mentioned is how mass transit or rapid transit is going to make downtown parking unnecessary . Of all the strange concepts now being held , this is probably the winner . Believe me , the average American is going to give up downtown long before he gives up his automobile . The idea that great numbers of new people are going to come to town on transit is plain silly until that method of competing transportation can beat the automobile at its own game . This is going to be some job , and we now know it . The automobile is the most convenient method of transportation yet devised . The car is ready to go when its owner wants and where its owner wants and operates strictly on the owner 's schedule . On the other hand , transit leaves when it wants , and goes where it wants , and runs on its schedule and the rider has to re-mold his trip to meet that pre-determined by the bus or train . The automobile is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rail transit , the bus averages between 9 and 11 miles per hour on its overall trip . The automobile averages between 15 and 20 miles per hour . The bus takes twice as long to get there , not including transfers . The idea that transit is cheaper also does n't hold water . From Silver Spring to downtown Washington is a distance of about 9 miles . The one way transit fare is 47 cents . If there are two people involved , this makes a total fare of about $2.00 a day for riding transit . Assuming that most people are going to have a car anyway , the fixed costs of insurance and depreciation are going to go on regardless of whether that car sits in the driveway or is rolling . The only additional cost is gasoline , tires and oil . Assuming that parking can be had near governmental offices for $1.00 to $1.50 per day , and gasoline is 30 cents a gallon , it is immediately evident that the automobile is cheaper than transit , and a whole lot more convenient and comfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transit is that the average citizen should want to see the downtown remain in a good state of health so their tax situation will stay on an even keel as downtown pays most of the taxes . The average citizen could not care less about the downtown merchants ' problems of traffic , parking , taxes , or what have you . I Ic has his hands lull with his wife , mortgage , and crab grass . Ile is going iii me // the average retail merchant no two minutes of his time , or care what happens to him because he is quite sure the merchant is not staying up at night worrying about his problems either . " Lamentably , this sort of argument often breaks down into a fight against mass transit by rail rather than transit in general , with the resultant danger of throwing out both baby and bath . ' In any case , the arguments against mass transit should be carefully evaluated . Unattractiveness The case for the unattractiveness of mass transportation almost makes itself . At the most obvious level , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be nonexistent . In terms of aesthetic pleasure which may be derived from the equipment used , much of it has seen better days ; too often , in the case of rail equipment , those better days were from twenty to fifty years ago . The federal-aid programs are slowly changing the reality in many places , but the image lingers . Many transit buses in regular use today first saw the light of day fifteen or twenty years ago . Since the average economic life of a bus is estimated at ten to twelve years , these old coaches are living on borrowed time . The scratches , rattles , and discomfort ? often because of lack of modern suspension and air conditioning ? rate them considerably below even the roughest foreign compact car in amenities . The amount of space per passenger is skimpy in most buses , even the newest models . In the typical seating arrangement , there is little room for the knees of taller riders . The narrowness of the seats often leaves the posterior of aisle passengers partially hanging in mid-air , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the narrow aisle . Moreover , being thrown together with a bunch of strangers may be in and of itself most uncomfortable . " The meanness of the dimensions of the ordinary motor bus is related to its having to share public streets with other vehicles . It would be difficult to make buses much larger . Only by cutting down on the number of seats could more comfortable seating be provided for the passengers . It is possible that large articulated or doubledeck buses could maintain hitch seating capacity yet offer greater comfort and room . ' ' // Admittedly , even at best a vehicle designed for the mass transportation of many people must inevitably have a long way to go to match the aesthetic desires of any one of them . If , on top of this , equipment is marred by its age , it is small wonder that mass transport is viewed by much of the public as an inferior good . " Some railway equipment is still so unbelievably ancient that one gets the impression that the only concession to modernity is the electric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to join the Army and help General Pershing rid Europe of the Kaiser . In some situations the equipment may not be so bad but the mass transit facilities may be quite ancient and most unattractive . In other cases it is the lack of facilities , such as the absence of bus shelters at even major stops , that makes the use of the bus uncomfortable and unattractive . On the other hand , users of rail transit , particularly the subways , often enjoy the use of facilities of remarkably low standards , a presentiment of which may have inspired Dante . The New York City subway system , for example , is often cited as possessing possibly the most wretched " standard of living " in the world . Most subway stations in the United States were designed not by architects but by engineers who thought mainly in terms of structural strength and cost saving rather than aesthetics . Design which is dominated by engineers is often infelicitous at best , unless it is impossible for them to avoid aesthetic competence as in the case of a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facilities could not be attractive ; to improve them is often an enormously costly business . Modern standards of lighting alone would improve many subway stations and might even make them safer . Perhaps , as residents of a generally affluent nation , we place undue emphasis on surface gloss . Nevertheless , the fact remains that to attract more patronage , mass transport must be made visually and physically more attractive.46 Unpleasant facilities are not endemic to mass transit . In San Francisco the Bay Area Rapid Transit District has taken considerable pains to assure the attractiveness of all of the station facilities and linear parks have been contructed under sonic of the elevated segments of the system . Similar care is being taken in construction of the new rapid transit systems in Washington , I ) . ( ' . , and iii the renovation work being carried out in Boston . " // Not to paint the picture too darkly , modern bus and rail equipment is considerably more comfortable and attractive than mass transit hardware of the past generation . Atlanta , Chicago , Philadelphia , Dallas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name only a few ? have purchased substantial numbers of new buses and rail cars . The federal capital grant program has helped to provide these tools for better mass transportation . Over the horizon is the promise of a greatly improved bus design . The rapid transit equipment in present use in San Francisco not only gives passengers a fast and comfortable ride , but also appeals to them visually . Equipment of equally high standards is slated for Washington . The problem is , of course , that there is still so much decrepit or poorly designed or overage equipment in use today that it blemishes the image of all mass transportation undertakings . Another , related , factor is that many white Americans do not wish to ride in the same vehicle with minority groups ? particularly Blacks and Puerto Ricans . The reverse may be true as well . Solid , middle-class citizens may also fear to use public transportation at night because of robberies and other violence . Indeed , apart from danger to passengers , the situation for the bus drivers ? who usually carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crisis point in 1968 . After a number of murders and shootings in connection with robberies , many systems refused to allow drivers to make change , and patrons were forced to have the exact fare or to purchase tokens in advance . ' s If the drivers are fearful , is it any wonder that the patrons shy away from transit ? ' " For whatever reason , there is very clear evidence that people have been staying away in large numbers from mass transportation . Total passengers moved by transit fell from 17.2 billion in 1950 to 6.8 billion in 1971 . In a little over twenty years patronage had fallen off by a little more than 60 per cent . Patronage declines will be discussed in greater detail later in this book but the defection of riders is evidence of dissatisfaction with transit among those who have a choice in utilizing the service . ' " Various factors are cited for the use of the automobile instead of mass transport . Analysts have developed lists of determinants that affect the use of mass transportation , including such things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions , family income . auto mobile ownership , population density , and CBD density , to mention // just a few . There seems to be fairly conclusive evidence that automobile ownership is the key variable ; if a person owns a car , he is going to use it as a better alternative than mass transit.i1 Another obvious element affecting the great fall off in comparative attractiveness of mass transportation is the fact that government highway construction policy has encouraged the use of the automobile . This , coupled with a policy of government mortgage insurance encouraging suburban development , means that many people can only be served effectively by private automobiles and highways . In short , building highways causes a demand for more highways because the type of living carried on can have its transport demands met only by highway-oriented private transportation. i2 Inflexibility It is often charged that mass transportation is inflexible , meaning usually that a transport line can not be altered to meet changing needs of the population over time . It is sometimes claimed that transit can handle only the journey-to-work with any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rail transportation , where , in all truth , it has a certain validity . Flexibility , however , has several dimensions . First of all , it is the ability to perform several alternative tasks at any given time ; secondly , it is the ability to meet changing conditions over time . A highway is rather flexible as an investment in that it can handle not only the private automobile carrying a breadwinner to work but it can also carry the family downtown for a show or out of town on a vacation . Trucks and buses can also use it for a variety of purposes . Highways are not flexible , however , in accommodating demand increases over time ; lax planning also permits encroachment of residential and business uses that may greatly overtax the capacity of a given highway or network . Rail is usually held to be the least flexible mode of mass transportation , one that can not meet the changing needs of the public as well as the other modes of transport . A rapid transit line built to serve portions of a city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not have an automobile and jobs were concentrated downtown , can not meet today 's needs of the more affluent and widely distrih uted population which work at jobs scattered broadly about the // urban area . This conception of rail transport focuses mainly on the obvious difficulty of physically moving a rail facility . Some new thinking has been generated in the provision of rail transit facilities , particularly in regard to improved pickup and delivery . New rail lines under construction and some already in existence have recently focused attention on the provision of parking space at stations . The Cleveland Transit System has taken the lead in providing a considerable amount of space at stations toward the ends of the rapid transit line . The new San Francisco Ray Area Rapid Transit system has large parking areas at its outlying stations . The Washington Metro , now under construction in the nation 's capital , has also made provision for massive car parking at the stations outside the downtown area . Cleveland , San Francisco , and Washington , then , are good examples of rapid transit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outlying areas . There are a number of recent moves ? some sponsored by federal grants ? to do a better job of planning the feed-in of passengers by bus as well as automobile to rail transit lines ; this approach is becoming standard in rapid transit design . " Bus inflexibility is one of the more peculiar facets of this issue because it has nothing at all to do with the capabilities of the mode of transportation itself but , rather , on how it is operated . Improvement in the flexibility of service in meeting new needs is possible with astute management . However , the rigidity of public officials who refuse to allow bus route changes and the equally short-sightedness of management , who , too often , can see no reason for any change other than cutting back service , has provided the ludicrous spectacle of buses continuing religiously to follow trails blazed by the streetcar three-quarters of a century ago . ( As an example of governmental rigidity , Indiana 's mass transit law prohibits nonfixed route services , as the Greater Lafayette Public Transportation Corporation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How often today will bus route 14 follow the route of the old 14 streetcar line , regardless of how conditions have changed ? When asked why this situation is so , management usually replies politely that it has always operated the 14 line there , and they could n't pet permission from the city or the Public Utilities Commission to change it if they so wished . Sometimes one gets the impression that // Moses brought much of the United States transit route structure down from Sinai , etched indelibly on stone tablets . The bus probably offers the most golden opportunities for fast transit improvement with relative ease and lack of expense . Service to new areas , express running , and downtown shuttle service can be implemented quickly , since major public works are not needed . Reserve lanes on existing highways or newly constructed busways can overcome the problem of slowness in bus transit ; however , the busways may add to the line-haul inflexibility , in terms of being able to switch the routing site as need demands , by giving the bus a private pathway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rail right-of-way . Really , major gains in attractiveness ? especially speed may therefore be purchased only by giving up on some of the bus 's strong points in flexibility . Nevertheless , many means may be used to increase flexibility and usefulness of the bus . Some of these are the result of federal programs , to he discussed at length in subsequent chapters . Outstanding among these are the subscription bus service operations , in which passengers contract in advance for door-to-door bus service . In effect , the bus chases after the people instead of the other way around . Dial-a-bus can also be worked out so that smaller buses can be used somewhat in the manner of taxicabs by use of the telephone and two-way radio communications . " In summary , flexibility is a problem in mass transport , but one that can be mitigated , if not completely overcome , by astute management , open-minded city fathers , and willingness of both parties to try operational innovations . Expense It is charged that transit is not a low-cost solution to the problem of mobility . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conclusion that it depends upon circumstances . Population Distribution One of the most serious arguments raised against mass transportation and attempts at its resuscitation is that urban population in the United States has become so thinly distributed and is apparently growing more so that it simply can not be handled mass transportation . Certainly , the trend of the last fifty years has // been toward urban dispersion just as it has been to metropolitanization.55 The single family home on a spacious lot in the suburbs is still thought to be the dream of most Americans . It is equally true that such areas are extremely difficult to serve with mass transportation . This is especially so if density is conceived of solely in terms of persons living close enough to a transit artery to walk to it . If for many years the trend has been toward dispersal and low density , one of the greatest mistakes one can make is to depend upon the projection of past events for an accurate clue to the future . For example , the Federal Electric Railway Commission in its deliberations in 1919 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward increasing use of the streetcar , could not envision how the city would ever get along without the electric trolley.5 " Looking at the trends , it simply could not be imagined that in the future the automobile would become the dominant means of transportation in most cities . Perhaps the single family home and increasingly dispersed living are the inevitable and inescapable trend of the foreseeable future . However , the rapid rise in the number of apartments being constructed in both urban and suburban areas indicates that many Americans are willing to put up with considerably more density in their housing than has been suspected . In any event , as powerful as the decentralizing force has been , there is no reason to believe that it is inevitable and unchangeable.5i Another factor to consider is that certain forms of mass transportation will serve as a population centralizer . New investment in rapid transit and commuter railways ? investment which has only rarely been made in the United States in the half-century of the auto age ? could sharply affect future densities . A city which has invested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sweden , may find that either because they planned it that way , or through private but not inadvertent decisions , a considerable number of people are attracted to concentrated locations along the right-of-way of the rapid transit lines rather than scattering thinly over a considerably wider area . ' " The Swedish experience is interesting in that the country has a level of auto ownership about equal to that of the United States . Another element often neglected by critics is that people can supply , in effect , their own pickup and delivery service in connection with ( mass transportation . A rail line projecting out into the // suburbs equipped with large parking lots at its stations need not pass through an area of great population density to secure ridership as long as there is reasonably good access to the stations . Even the superhighway or freeway running out into a suburban area acts merely as a line-haul agent , very much like a railway . Most such highways deliberately avoid passing through high-density areas . The thinly distributed suburban population taking advantage of modern superhighways in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to and from the freeway through the use of conventional streets . It is , in many ways , like a feeder bus connection to a commuter railway line . Clearly the role of mass transit in a dispersed community is a matter that needs considerable thought and analysis , but the notion that rapid transit or commuter rail service depends strictly on massive numbers of people highly concentrated in very small areas immediately adjacent to the transit line is no longer necessarily true . Mass Transport in the Decentralized Metropolis The trend toward decentralization of population is difficult to evaluate in relation to the pros and cons of mass transit . Really , one immediately gets to the tough and value-laden question of " what should a city be like ? " This again raises the economic and social issue of affordable mobility . Mobility costs the individual time , money , and effort ( or energy , including stress ) . So far , the question of mobility has been given only middle-class answers primarily through increasing the supply of automobile-oriented facilities to satisfy the wants of the automobile-owning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dimension of mobility , with perhaps some reduction in effort . Inadequate transportation looms as one of many factors in prolonging the vicious cycle of apartheid and poverty faced by ghetto dwellers , many of whom have rural origins and are ignorant of city ways . Jobs are one of the primary keys to breaking the ghetto cycle and ending the cold civil war in the United States . The problem is that many jobs ? particularly in the sort of heavy industry that still has a place for persons of marginal skill have been moved out of the central cities and scattered in the suburbs . Public transport is often not available at all to suburban locations , or is even more execrable than the mass transit service oriMass // ented to the city core . A dependable car is necessary to get and hold a job , yet the cost of a dependable car is often beyond the means of the poor . Providing mobility for those without cars is a vital role for mass transport . The provision of transportation alone is obviously not a cure-all for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along with such items as health , education , legal assistance ? and even babysitting services ? is part of a bundle of ac tivities necessary to help break people out of the ghetto cycle . Another factor often neglected has been the cost of poor public transportation to poor people . The erosion of traffic from mass transportation modes , often as a result of the highway policy of the federal and other levels of government , has usually resulted in a substantial decline in the quality of service and a rise in the fares charged by public transit companies . The service decline as much as the fare boost is a substantial cost to the poor as well as to the community as a whole . Failure to account for such costs to captive riders of public transport is one of the many gaps in our thinking in regard to the true cost of highways that encourage greater automobile use . The decline in the quality of mass transit service is as much a cost of highways as is the concrete that goes to build them . Such federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its intent is the preservation and enhancement of central city values ; the hope is expressed that mass transit service , along with highways , can help shape as well as serve cities . However , as long as mass transit expenditures are so small $175 million a year at most up until the early 1970 's ? it is doubtful that much shaping will be done . Much more than just spending money is involved , of course . The will to solve our urban problems must be found , and that has proved to be an elusive guest . " Until a change comes , the United States must suffer from the burdens of dispersion , poverty , blight , and staggering mobility problems . Transportation as a Status Symbol In any list of pros and cons of mass transportation versus the automobile one inevitably runs into the problem of the automobile as a status symbol . It is easy to conclude that the average American is so goofy about his automobile  --  in large part because it enhances his standing in the community that it is hopeless to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // It is easy ? too easy ? to conclude that the joys of ownership do not also include the pains of possession and use . Without doubt the automobile is a powerful symbol of both self and success . It is probably equally true , however , that there has been a considerable erosion of status power associated with the automobile among many social classes because automobiles have become so commonplace . It is far wiser , perhaps , to view status as just one of a whole group of factors that make the use of the automobile attractive . Still , there is no doubt that since most people are rational , even the most status conscious will be likely to use mass transportation if it is a better alternative than driving . The real problem is to provide that better alternative . ' " Another factor is to take appropriate action so that the negative connotations associated with mass transportation are eliminated and transit is given a more positive image . Some Conclusions One can safely conclude that mass transport has a definite role to play in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By improving the quality and quantity of mass transit , the public can enjoy the advantages of added mobility through increased choice between transport means of relatively more comparable quality . Clearly , all our urban and domestic problems are not going to be solved by improving mass transportation any more than Prohibition solved domestic problems in that hectic decade of experiment in the 1920 's . It is also clear that many of the shortcomings of mass transit may be overcome . It can be made more attractive than it is , and as subsequent chapters will point out , it probably can offer a reasonable travel alternative to a fair number of people now attracted only to the automobile . Mass transport can certainly improve on its service to those people who have no alternatives . But public mass transportation is not going to meet everyone 's needs ; no one should expect it to do so . The opposition to improved mass transportation generally views it as a threat to continued expansion of highways and highway-related activities and supply of equipment , not as an intrinsically had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make the strongest case possible against mass transit ; they arc aided and abetted by many federal , state , and local officials who can not conMass // ceive of transportation other than highway transport . Moreover , the highway lobby is awesomely bankrolled . Thus the reasonable arguments for and against mass transportation , and the facts which can make it clear that improved mass transport of one form or another is , indeed , a wise policy in a given place , may be held back or even for a time overcome by the vested highway interests or by sheer ignorance . " A thundering herd of interest groups ranging from the Auto mobile Manufacturers ' Association to those who build highways and to the great petroleum companies all have a stake in the continued upward spiral of highway construction and the use of the automobile . There are good arguments on both sides of the transit issue , but the sheer economic power of the highway interests may ? if they feel seriously threatened ? overcome any good arguments that might be made in behalf of mass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group plays a far more important role in policy formulation and action on the part of all levels of government than the best interests of the public . The small sums traditionally spent by government for nonhighway transportation are enlightening evidence . Not so many years ago a national magazine stated : According to Department of Transportation experts , it would take a minimum of $37 billion over the next five years to make even a start on cleaning up the nation 's transportation mess : $5 billion for corridor trains ? Boston to Washington to New York ; Chicago to Milwaukee and Detroit ; San Francisco to Los Angeles $4 billion for airports , $5 billion for airways ( that is , for automated controls sic of flights ) , $8 billion for mass transit , the rest for establishing bus transit , fringe parking , automated roadways , and the like . That kind of money can only come from the U.S. Government ? and justifiably so , since an efficient transportation system is vital to an efficient economy . But to quote the nation 's first Secretary of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million for mass transit for 50 states . At best one city , after a couple of years of haggling , might get $900,000 . Now what the hell good is that going to do against $1 billion available for highway projects ? " 62 For its part , mass transportation has developed its own lobbying group and , to some extent , there are more equal countervailing forces at work . As passage of the Highway Act of 1973 reveals , the situation has begun to change , though perhaps not as rapidly as one would like . CHAPTER THREE Urban Mass Transportation : The Institutions The principal institutional actors on the stage of mass transportation improvement are the mass transportation industry in the United States and the Urban Mass Transportation Administration ( UMTA ) of the U.S. Department of Transportation . A major role for the cities is the commitment to improvement of mass transportation and the provision ? in conjunction with UMTA and the local transit operating agency ? of the support needed to do the job . There are other more minor participants in the drama , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposing forces ? but they have many other roles to play . Transit improvement , broadly defined , is the goal of federal programs ; the delivery of this improvement to the public , whatever form it may take , is the province of the mass transportation industry . The improvement must come to grips with the urban mobility problem in its three major facets : ( 1 ) a lack of mobility for many citizens , ( 2 ) thwarted mobility for citizens who are victims of congestion , and ( 3 ) the purchase of mobility at high pecuniary and social costs . Put more simply , action has to be taken that will help provide mobility to all citizens who need it , and do the lob with reasonable economy . If mass transportation is to be truly useful , it should have a broad appeal and should have reasonable value as an alternative to other means of transportation for those members of the public 130 // who can afford alternatives and who have regular access to them . It also means that the formulation and implementation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneficial places in which to live . In other words , barriers to mobility are an economic and social cost burden upon the urban public . Action that can lessen these costs will not only benefit urban dwellers , but all citizens who utilize goods and services produced in urban areas ? goods and services whose ultimate costs must reflect the various costs of urban life , including transportation . Much of what follows is a discussion of the transit industry . This is usually construed to mean those mass transportation firms and agencies that operate bus , rapid transit , street railway , and trolley bus services . The transit industry , as such , does not include taxicab companies nor operators of commuter railroads , even though they are clearly in the for-hire segment of urban transportation . The railroad industry is , of course , a thing unto itself , of which the commuter train operations are considered largely as an appendix . The railroads certainly do n't consider themselves a part of the transit industry . Indeed , the reflections by members of the railway industry on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to identify themselves on an institutional basis probably more strongly with the " regular " ( meaning intercity freight ) transportation industry . Mass transportation is often categorized by the railroads as " a bunch of crazy bus drivers . " Whatever thoughts the transit industry may have about the railroad industry have not been vouchsafed . Despite the fact that the taxicab industry in the United States moves about as many passengers as surface rail , rapid transit , trolley coach , and commuter rail , plus about half as many as those moved by bus , it is rarely considered in any discussion of urban transportation . If not properly a part of the mass transportation industry , taxicabs , along with transit and commuter rail , are public transportation . A happy exception to the usual omission of the taxicab is found in the book Economic Characteristics of the Urban Public Transportation Industry . ' Despite this contribution , remarkably little is generally known about the taxicab industry . All of which returns to the question of what is properly included in the mass transportation industry . Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within it all erodes whose services are still // stitutes for one another . Speaking of the urban transportation industry in the broadest sense , one would have to include the private automobile , transit , commuter rail , and taxicab operations , since they are all substitutes for one another . A narrower view of the mass transportation industry would separate the for-hire , common carrier segment from the private automobile . What follows , therefore , involves the urban mass transportation industry , with emphasis on mass . As noted above , the place of the taxicab in urban mass transportation is often ignored . Cabs , of course , are for-hire to particular individuals ; however , there is nothing unusual about several passengers making separate journeys , but riding together , very much like a small bus . Cabs are certainly not private vehicles as far as their patrons are concerned , but not being entirely public either , have apparently been consigned to a kind of yellow-hued limbo . Taxis are excluded from the aid provided by the Urban Mass Transportation Administration and , as noted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in the hearts and minds of those involved in other segments of the mass transportation industry . For the sake of this work , the taxi will be included in the discussion of the transportation modes that deliver a service to the public . An Overview of the Transit Industry Chapter 1 gave a perspective on the setting for the development of federal urban transport policy and touched on the highlights of mass transit history . Here , the aim is more complete : to take a look at the transit industry as an institution , in order to see what gives it its particular tone and what factors are significant in affecting the industry 's ability to deliver a useful and attractive public service ' The typical way in which firms in an industry are organized often gives a clue to the effectiveness of that industry in providing goods or services . It is a fair assessment of the organization of the transit industry to say that it is geared to produce a service but most certainly not to sell it . If we review the various organizational charts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the organizational forms typifying different segments of the industry , the lack of a marketing function is most disturbing . Seven organizational charts arc shown in Principles , song more or less idealized // and others taken from those used by actual operating companies at the time the book was written . One of these , for a medium-sized firm , is reproduced in Figure 3-1 , as being typical of the group . Not one of the charts in the Principles book includes marketing as a central line function of the firm . Even today , as one looks at some of the larger transit properties , a great deal of detail can be found in almost any organizational chart , or organizational structure beyond the charts , for the care and feeding of the equipment and the sched uling and utilization of manpower . But apart from some token public relations programs , little or nothing is done to find out what the public wants or to figure out how to deliver it in an appealing , marketing-oriented manner . A recent unpublished study of forty small mass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they , too , fail to include marketing as a formal part of the structure of the firm . The typical organizational form of the transit firm is derived from the days when the public transit companies had virtual monopolies on surface transportation , and there was no need to carry out any effort that approached a modern marketing program . The virtue of a true marketing effort is that it provides information about customers and potential customers ' needs and wants , and it helps to develop the means of providing the service to meet those needs and wants , in line with the objectives of the agency charged with the delivery of the service . The package of service , fare , and promotion can then be determined in an orderly , planned fashion . This whole effort requires constant monitoring of public attitudes and actions . Without the necessary information and the planned action oriented to the consumer , transit management 's hands are tied . Whatever is done can only be a reaction based on limited knowledge and on tactical expediency . If one assumes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good sign that transit is fulfilling its role in society , then an organizational structure that made marketing a central function of the organization would seem to be the wisest . This is undoubtedly not the case in the transit industry , where demand for service has eroded seriously since the end of the Second World War . Forces beyond the control of even the most enlightened marketingoriented management have brought on this decline in patronage . in all likelihood , the declines were deeper and came more precipitously // because of the lack of true marketing effort . With a thorough marketing effort , one would expect that demand for mass transportation should be increased as a result of consumer needs being met by service that is useful and attractive . That is , transit becomes an increasingly better alternative relative to other means of transport , or to staying home for those citizens having no alternative means of mobility . Some Industry Background The present-day attitude and approach of the transit industry have developed over a long period of time . It is instructive to review these origins because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the possibilities of change in the industry . The transit industry developed in stages ; in the beginning , a city often supported many independent transit firms . Each major street usually had its own street railway company , independent from those operating on other streets or sections of town . Toward the end of the nineteenth century these separate companies began to consolidate for the purpose of operating more profitably . Another reason was to increase the attractiveness of the firms for investment so that sufficient capital could be marshalled to convert animal-powered systems to electric traction . Consolidation made sense , not only for the managers seeking to improve their profit positions , but also for the public . Competition in transit is uneconomical for the operators and expensive and difficult for the public . Indeed , if there is any business that is a natural monopoly for a given urban area , it is the transit industry . With a merged and coordinated system , service could be improved and patrons could gain increased flexibility and mobility through transfer privileges between different lines of the united system . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dominant factor , was that financial manipulation of the securities of firms that were candidates for merger provided the possibility of substantial profit for insiders . As mergers proceeded in many cities , the Union Traction Company , or whatever it was called , came to have a near monopoly on surface transportation ; it was not difficult to unload vast amounts of watered securities on an investing public greedy for a piece of an enterprise that monopolized an essential service . // The reason for making this point is that around the turn of the century a good bit of the public transit service in the United States was offered by companies not interested in making money from providing a good service to urban citizens . Rather , large profits were to be gained primarily through financial manipulation . This does not mean , of course , that all transit properties were engaged in financial hanky-panky or that service was necessarily poor ; for an intraurban transportation monopoly , operation as well as manipulation was profitable . The problem was that the financial skullduggery burdened transit firms with a capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was far beyond the earning capacity of the property . In many cities , long before the advent of competition from the automobile , transit firms were in serious financial shape . Many such firms , their fares limited to a nickel by the franchise to operate in the public streets , went bankrupt when caught by the skyrocketing inflation of the First World War . This , despite rapidly increasing patronage as the nation geared itself for conflict . ' The situation changed as the twentieth century progressed and the plague of financial chicanery receded somewhat . The flavor of the mass transit industry changed in the first two decades of the twentieth century to one that was typified by a combination of transit operations and public utility service . When the street railway companies were electrified , many of them had excess electrical generating capacity ; they sold some of this power to industrial and private users . Over time the electrical generating arm of what had originally been mainly a transit firm became larger and more profitable than the transit operation . By about 1920 , electric utilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around . Public utility holding companies were formed and began to expand in order to exploit the national thirst for electric power . Transit firms were usually gathered up as a part of the package . The success and continued growth of the electrical generating side of the combined transit-electrical utility made possible , in many cases , cross-subsidization of mass transportation services by the parent company . This cross-subsidy included not only a money subsidy from the power side to the transit side for capital improvements , but also a subsidy in the form of management talent . As the big utility firms grew larger , they could hid for the best executive talent , and some of the talent could he devoted to the mass transportation // services . After the competition of the automobile made itself felt in the mid-1920 's , and transit patronage began to decline , the industry needed all the talent it could get . ' In the ' 30 's , in large part thanks to the financial shenanigans of utilities magnate Samuel Insull , the split-off of the transit industry from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one pany Act . Because the transit industry had already begun its decline , this necessity was not always viewed with gloom by the utilities . The spin-off tended to weaken seriously the newly independent transit firms . First of all , of course , there was no subsidy in the form of cash from the parent electrical utility to the transport undertaking ; a source of ready internal capital thus dried up . The independent transit operation , standing alone , might have real trouble attracting funds in the capital market . In the darkness of the Depression , capital from any source was very hard to come by , and physical deterioration of the transit properties became serious . Secondly , and perhaps with more lasting and disastrous impact , the management subsidy which the utility companies had provided was pulled away . Indeed , at the time of divestiture the sharper transit managers were often taken up into the bosom of the public utility electrical generating firm , while the transit firms themselves were left with second best . Moreover , since transit is a local business , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cities . Talented transit management personnel tended to gravitate to the larger cities . Despite a lack of data to prove the point , the fact that the transit industry has been on a declining course for a half-century means that many talented individuals who might have made a significant contribution to quality management , and given the industry an infusion of fresh ideas , have sought careers elsewhere . There are talented transit management personnel , but they are not numerous and they are most likely to be concentrated in the larger urban places . A new wrinkle in the transit industry developed during the ' 30 's , as transit holding companies began to form . General Motors , seeing an economic opportunity for the wholesale replacement of the streetcar by the motor bus , through its subsidiary The Omnibus Corporation , entered into control of a good many of the formerly independent transit properties .

' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies apparently had as their major objective the profit potential of supplying buses and other equipment to their properties in the switchover from streetcar to bus operation . Certainly , in the 1930 's there was still the chance of profitable operations for some years to come , but it is probably accurate to say that most of these firms were less interested in serving the public and building patronage as a means of profit than of making profit from sales of equipment and supplies . In the postwar era it appeared that almost everybody ? especially customers had hailed out on the transit industry . There were declines across the board in patronage , which were soon reflected in declining revenues and earnings . For a long time it was difficult to find anybody who was really interested in taking effective action to ameliorate the situation . Stockholders did not seem to care to make improvements that would boost patronage and earnings ; they were busy trying to get out of the transit business .

Besides , the regulatory rubric was based on public oversight of a monopoly ; growing automobile ownership made such a concept totally irrelevant . In general , most U. S. cities appeared to be indifferent to the plight of the transit companies not too surprising in that transit in the United States has traditionally been a private enterprise operating as a regulated monopoly . Usually the position of the city vis-a-vis the transit property operating within it was one of antagonism with mutual recrimination at times of service change or fare increase . To the local politician , savaging his city 's transit firm was usually good sport and , in the short-term , good politics . The influential voting element of a city bought more cars and wanted something to operate them upon , so the politicos pushed for highways ; constructive plans for mass transportation , or pleas for help , were ignored . Most cities remained indifferent until their transit systems went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remain indifferent and , for this reason , over two hundred transit firms // disappeared from the scene during the ' 50 's and early ' 60 's . In places where public pressure demanded continuation of service , the cities were not quite so indifferent , especially when they ended up inheriting a bankrupt transit property . As the ' 60 's proceeded , public ownership became the only way most cities could continue to retain any sort of transit service . Another important factor in increasing the level of interest was , of course , the availability of federal money for mass transportation purposes . While it is fair to say that in the 1970 's many cities are far more directly interested in improving the quality of urban mass transportation than ever before , transit still provides a good whipping boy for politicians . A mayor wishing to find a scapegoat can always use the supposed ineptitude of the transit management as a place to deflect public attention .

In any event , the complexion of the transit industry began to change markedly in the postwar era . As patronage plummeted , the possibility of profit from operations became to a large extent a forlorn hope . Even the lucrative possibilities of furnishing equipment and supplies began to erode as the changeover from streetcars to buses became almost complete . Declining patronage and revenues in the face of rising costs meant that the market for new buses was very small indeed after the spate of new equipment purchases for renewal and replacement in the immediate postwar period . The transit holding companies began to withdraw from the ownership and operation of mass transportation services and turn their attention to greener pastures . One innovation that has grown increasingly popular in the transit industry is the transit management company . Usually based on one of the former holding companies , the management company will operate a transit property for a city at a fee .

It is too early to state definitely what the impact of such firms will he , but some of them have brought considerable skill to their work .
