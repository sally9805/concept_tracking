A Hollywood TV-film producer whom I know recently traded off the entire studio to Charles Bluhdorn 's giant Gulf &; Western Industries for above S 17 millions ' worth of G &W; stock . One of the things which made the deal attrac  --  tive to Mr. Bluhdorn ( also owner of Paramount Pictures and who promptly christened his new combination Paramount Television ) was that my producer friend had looked around at an earlier point and picked up in the pilot stage three would-be TV shows which bigshots in the industry had already la  --  beled as some of the worst dogs on the market  --  these three scruffy experiments merely being " Mission Im  --  possible , " " Star Trek , " and " Mannix . " Enlarging on such de  --  monstrable business acu  --  men , and now majority stockholder in Gulf and Western , my rambunctious producer went on to build a new $30-million corporate property around the dur  --  able talents of that smash  --  ing redhead you see pic  --  tured on the opposite page , a lady who in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never been out of the top ten in those murderous TV ratings , has had her show translated in  --  to six languages and shown in seventy-seven countries , including Kuwait and who currently perches atop the ratings at about Number 3. while such estimable TV stars as Jackie Gleason , Sid Caesar , the Smothers Brothers , and the Beverly Hillbillies have disappeared from the live tube and hung up their greasepaint , won  --  dering where are all the cheers of yesteryear . If you have not guessed or do not know already , the world-beater Hollywood executive I have been ex tolling is  --  of course  --  Lucille Ball , the lady herself , probably the greatest combo of brains , beauty , boffs and belly laughs ever to show the tycoons how it can be done , whether behind or in front of the magic camera . It is no wonder at all therefore , that Holly  --  wood 's most feared card player is quoted as say  --  ing ; " I would n't play poker with that broad on a bet ? ' ? ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows . " I Love Lucy " opened in 1951 ; " The Lucy Show " beganin 1962 , and now we are on the set of " Here 's Lucy " in the huge studio of Lucille Ball Produc  --  tions , Inc. , in Universal City , California . Lucy is doing her thing again , and she is wowing them today just as she always has . There is an au  --  dience of about three hundred of all ages and types  --  youngsters , oldsters , middle-aged tourists , and a number of Hollywood professionals who appear to be there to see how simply the impos  --  sible can be done , and who are breaking up just like the kids at Lucy 's familiar but irresistible antics . Even hard-bitten cameramen , grown gray in a craft which has a time-honored tradition of putting down the stars whenever possible , and especially comedians , are breaking into leathery smiles as Lucy pursues her wide-eyed wiles on stage . I have dragged with me an unwilling compan  --  ion , a young lady fresh from an intellectually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with first honors in any contest to provide an anti-Lucy note , if such were required . She has justregarded the audience with cool disdain , and now is resigned to suffering through the show ? a con  --  fection featuring a show-within-a-show , a musical comedy bit starring Lucy 's regular sidekicks , Gale Gordon , daughter Lucie Arnaz and , as guest star , Ruth Buzzi , the giggle-getter from " Laugh-ln . " I would doubt that my companion has ever seen Lucy on TV ; if invited , she would more than likely refuse . But Lucy wins hands down in only minutes . I myself have shown my true colors by relaxing and let  --  ting nature take its course , which in this Lucy show seems to be a chuckle every second or two and a belly laugh every couple of min  --  utes . My hip companion struggles for a while  --  but then gives in , and frankly enjoys it . The show is really a winner , in which Lucy plays a character based on Texas Guinan , the famous nightclub hostess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sucker " ) , and her beautiful and talented daughter comes on as a sex-pot gold-digger chorus girl who puts on just one devil of a fine dancing show . What is immediately ap parent from this show is that Lucille Ball is a con summate actress . At one point , she is joking around with the cast , and she is in the middle of a big laugh just before the camera swivels over to her . The laugh fades immediately , to be replaced by the dole fully solemn expression re quired by the opening situ ation . The transition is automatic  --  she merely pushed the non-smile but ton somewhere inside . In the second skit of the show , while all eyes as well as the camera are following Lucie 's lightning-fast , flap per dance routine , Lucy leans on one of the props and relaxes more than anyone probably ever did on a stage before . She drops into the role of spectator . She dares to enjoy her work ! This turns into a real old-fashioned slap stick sequence , full of exploding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is really what the Lucy shows are about ) , and Lucy is nothing less than superb in her timing and in building up each gag to its maximum effect . I had read somewhere that Buster Keaton had originally taken a great shine to her , and coached Lucy in her early days , and now I can believe it . Some of her marvelous control of the comic medium is due to facial changes which do n't need a script gag at all-she comes on like a comedian of the old silent movies . You look , see , and laugh . You do n't have to hear the gag . I recall also that Lucy always was a great admirer of Carole Lom  --  bard- " I envied her " - who based her performance so often on comedy plastered over sex , and anoth  --  er possible ingredient of Lucy 's comic mastery comes to light . Whatever makes it all happen , it 's just about as complex on the surface and just about as deliciously easy to take as strawberries and cream . Later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of autograph seekers and worshippers . I have a date to visit her at home on the following afternoon , so our meeting is brief . But what a woman ! The Texas Guinan costume is a form-clinging black lace creation which would give most of Hollywood 's beau  --  ty queens the willies just at the thought of what flaws it could expose in the figure . But Lucy is sleek , serene , and stunning : she has a mannequin 's figure , the languid grace of an actress who has been both a dancer and a falling-down comic . And the perfect face is there , those big lamps of hers zooming out the vol  --  tage under the incredible head of tossed red hair . But what puts it all together-she is really sixty years of age , and you can simply forget about twenty of them-is the unquenchable vitality and sparkle of this woman . My young com  --  panion , now a Lucy fan for  --  ever , whispers : - That 's the sexiest voice I ever heard . And that laugh ! ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the motion picture Auntie Mame , which goes into pro  --  duction just about as you are reading this , and seeing her here , laughing and vi  --  brant and loving every min  --  ute of being with these stage-struck visitors to her show , you immediately re  --  alize that the people at Warner Brothers have made exactly the right decision in selecting their star . She smiles us on our way . The crowd dissipate and the huge structure ( there are three full-size stages on the Lucy stage set alone , plus seats for the audience , a stage for a band , projection room , etc. ) once again bounces to the music of a musical number in the show just taped , as the cast takes another run-through to perfect a sizzling dance sequence . I am standing on " Lucy Lane , " an indoor street even down to its simulated paving stones , on which Lucy and her staff of movie makers live when they 're working . I had heard stories that when Lucille Ball took over as the boss of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and occupied the old RKO front office once filled with the pomp and circum  --  stance of Joseph P. Kennedy ( in the twenties ) and Howard Hughes ( in the thirties ) that she had done it over , female-like , in green and yellow Florentine cut velvet . Here , in this vast Universal structure which she has rented from Universal Studios to put on her weekly TV show , Lucy has again had her way with her surroundings , and in no uncertain terms . Hollywood shooting studios are enormous barnlike structures capacious enough to enclose mock-ups of Westminster Abbey or the decks of ocean liners , but actors customarily have their dressing rooms in drab trailers lined up on the streets outside and festooned with the stars ' names . The director , at most , may have his trailer in  --  doors , where he may retire and brood while his cast inhabit their cubicles , cramming lines they have just fluffed , or resting in between takes . On the Lucy lot , she has decreed a little village street behind the stages for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House , " picket fence and all , which is Ruth Buzzi 's for this performance . Gale Gordon , Lucy 's regular male lead and foil-master of the outraged look , the slow burn , the silent side  --  wise look into the camera imploring pity , the delayed double and triple take , the pompous buildup for the inevitable put-down-oc  --  cupies " Gordon Manor . " Lucy 's cottage , with flow  --  ers and all on the window  --  sill and a tiny porch facing the street , is ablaze with her personality . The dressing rooms for the cast are " Beauty Salon , " another stop on this street of rural shops . " Boutique " is re  --  vealed as a general coat  --  room and costume ward  --  robe . " Lucyville Transpor  --  tation Co. " is where you get fixed up with wheels to take you elsewhere . All this took money . Evidently Lucy believes in spending it to be comfortable while you 're making it . There is a poignant moment now in Lucy Lane . A lady I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She is DeDe ( for " Desiree " ) the star 's e igh t y -y ear-old mother . She does not have her daughter 's height ( Lucy is quite statuesque ) , but she has her jazzy red hair , chic clothes and accessories . And more importantly , one realizes immediately that this is where Lucille got her beauty , that fey comedic quality , her zest for living , and her good sense . We speak a moment of Cel oron , population 1349 , on Chautauqua Lake , near Jamestown , New York , where Lucy was born . Fa mous Hollywood stars often must endure a family buildup which frequently includes high-flying fic tional elements as well as the hard fact that the parents are stashed away to pasture in some far corner inaccessible to the press . Mrs. Ball , formerly the wife of a telephone lineman , and proud of it , is right here . I mention an article in which Mrs. Ball is described as the daughter of a character so lovable and eccentric as to merit a whole TV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // a couple of sniffs and a tart phrase or two which put the late ancestor very firmly in his true histori  --  cal perspective . She adores her daughter and de  --  clares that she has never missed being present at a single Lucy show over the past twenty years . The fact is that I had waylaid Mrs. Ball as she was on her way to join a group of cheery ladies of her own age , and after our few words I let her go on to them . She is hardly of an age to expect J gentleman to watch her as she walks away  --  but I do , and about thirty or forty feet away , when she thinks she is hidden from me by stage scenery , and just as a blast of swinging music from the rehearsal fills the studio , she breaks into some zippy Charleston steps out of sheer exuberance . She 's Lucy 's mother , all right . ? ? Change of scene : Lucille Ball 's home in Beverly Hills . She is too much herself to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he lives in the Ronald Colman place , " or " they 're over at the Valentino house . " Lucille Ball is in the Lucille Ball place , and do n't you forget it . She has been called the richest woman in Hollywood , and those who talk about her income are fast and loose with plenty of the millions , but her home is designed not to show all that off but only to live comfortably in . It is on a spacious corner lot in a suburban area , not far in from the street , and its exterior  --  although it caused one lady interviewer to label it an " old  --  timey movie star mansion " ? is tasteful and con  --  ventional enough to suggest the residence of a suc  --  cessful banker or industrialist who had no desire to flaunt his well-being to an envious world . Lucy has the things she should have . She has a richly decorated formal living room , ditto dining room , and a large and less formal kind of gathering  --  place-room ( " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ double as a projection studio when she wants to run a movie or a tape of one of her TV shows . If she wants to dip into her library of the motion pictures she has starred in , she can choose from 157 of them , and reflect on such leading men as Bob Hope , Henry Fonda and Van Johnson . The big house wanders away into bedrooms , Lucy 's tree house  --  a retreat where she may hide away in a combination playroom and sundeck , sheltered by the shade of overbending trees  --  and into a hand  --  some library and study rooms for herself and for her husband , Gary Morton , whom she married in 1962 when she broke up with Desi Arnaz . Gary is a big , likable extrovert type who was originally a stand-up comedian on the Milton Berle kind of tune-in , and he still comes on before every Lucy show to warm up the studio audience with a line of patter and genial inside talk , about Lucy , although he is also vice-president of the company . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a golf nut with a passel of silver cups to prove it , and he has a barn full of antique classic cars , in con  --  trast to the resplendent Rolls-Royce which takes Lucy where she wants to go . It is only fair to note that the ghost of Desi Arnaz lingers about the house , if only because so many millions of TV viewers saw him and Lucy so many , many times in a show so convincingly , if not actually , based upon their married life together . Lucy had gone through the stock vicissitudes of a youngster seeking stardom before she met Desi . At fifteen she had tried her wings away from the Jamestown fold , and enrolled in the John Murray Anderson School in New York City , inspired by the stage presence of various luminaries of the Chautauqua shows in her birthplace . " No talent " was the verdict at the school by a teaching staff too pained by her efforts to keep the kid on . So Lucyhad to try it all  --  waitress , soda jerk , garment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend pushed her into a bit part in Roman Scan  --  dals , starring Eddie Cantor . She was a terrific-looking bunch of girl you can bet , and she went from one show to the other in those days when a biggie was n't a biggie unless it sported a bevy of sexy chorus girls to undulate on and off the stage without any apparent excuse , with fair regularity . It was during the filming of a show characteris  --  tically called Too Many Girls that she met a young Cuban bandleader and bongo player by the name of Desi Arnaz . They were married in 1940 . After World War II , they came upon their inspiration to pattern a TV show after their own lives , and thus the format of " 1 Love Lucy " evolved . So , in 1951 , did little Lucie , and then Desi IV , in 1953 . The rest we all have seen . Lucy speaks warmly of Desi and mentions that they often see each other , although he also has since remarried . I have no inclination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since he always struck me as a man of charm and a surprisingly effective actor who could milk the most out of his role . But , in the light of the opening facts in this article about Lucy 's business ability , it must be noted that when Desi was last president of Desilu Productions , Inc. , in 1961 , it lost over $600,000 in its total operations ; seven years later , under Lucy 's management , the company grossed $30 millions and made profits of over $800,000 . Well , Lucy is a strictly family type . Young Desi ( although no longer on her show  --  Lucy is reputed to have dismissed him for being " too expensive " ) Continued on page 95 continued from page 62 and Lucie are constantly in and out of the house , and Lucy has stashed all sorts of relatives throughout her business staff , She is intensely loyal to her past . So there really is not much chance that Desi himself will ever be forgotten for his part of the good  --  and not so good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front suggests . There is an interior garden , around which curls a guest cabana , and then you come up  --  on the swimming pool in the midst of an expanse of terrace . A terrace beautifully punctuated with trees set in solid banks of varicolored petu  --  nias . Beyond it all is Lucy 's private . private domain , It is part think-tank , part gymnasium , part dressing room , part poothouse , complete with a few choice mementos and a formidable-looking hi-fi-TV-whatnot combo . This is where we finally settle down to chat . Lucy is crazy for animals , and in  --  side her domain they keep barking into sight , a milling herd in which I could distinguish a Norwegian elk  --  hound , a Yorkshire terrier , and a passel of poodles of various sizes . The dog population seems to vary according to who 's staying in the guest cabana , I would suppose  --  so Lucy regards them all as welcome transients . They did raise quite a row over me , possibly because I also like cats , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some  --  where about a fifth below a con  --  tralto . At home , Lucy is no-nonsense , no side . She has recently suffered a broken leg , acquired at her winter lodge , Snowmass , Colorado , a five-story condominium where she holes up every so often with her family en  --  tourage . It seems that the lady who has survived a thousand pratfalls. and who takes no chances on any slope more demanding than the bunny special at Snowmass , was merely standing there on her skis when she was blitzed by an out-of  --  control schusser , spun around in her harness , and  --  crack  --  there went the million-dollar gam . When I was at her live show , she had exuberantly greet  --  ed her audience by prancing delight  --  edly in front of them the whole length of the place in a black pants suit , skillfully concealing the fact that her leg is hung onto her by pins , simply by adopting a stiff-legged skip which anyone not knowing of her injury might have accepted mere  --  ly as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But it must have been devilishly painful . Today , she is wearing high boots , thigh revealing pants , and a big man 's shirt ( probably Gary 's ) with the tails flapping in the breeze . More relaxed here , she walks with a slight limp , and obviously it hurts . But knowing Lucy , and hearing from others of the pain and exercising she had to go through just to get back on her feet and function , I am positive that she will be floating on her feet like a breeze when she starts working on Mame . I look closely at her , and she looks back with one of the most un  --  wavering looks this side of Chautau  --  qua Lake . She is not wearing make  --  up , and the famous mop of hair is even more moppy than you have ever seen it  --  it is going to take some hairdresser hours merely to tease it back into a careful semblance of mere explosion and she could n't care less . I sense that her intelligence is na @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than something ac  --  quired as she climbed up the ladder in Hollywood . Of course she learned as she went , but the wheels were al  --  ways in wonderfully working order up in that bead she has parlayed into a symbol of the addlepated house  --  wife . Desi IV puts it this way : " As a businesswoman , she 's good instinc  --  tively but not technically . She knows this and surrounds herself with sharp people . Her contribution is to serve as a motivating force . " I get the idea . One look from Lucy in a successful producer . She can subor  --  dinate the actor in herself to the director . She enjoys finding words for her thoughts . Once every so often there is an interrupting telephone call . Mostly about Mame -. the wheels are beginning to turn , And does Lucy love it ! When she answers a question , she does so after some thought . She has no hold-back ; i.e. , she trusts in her interviewer and obviously says pre  --  cisely what she thinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vitality . It bursts right out of her all the time -- tremendous vocal emphasis when she is emotionally in  --  volved with what she is saying . " I tried all of the ski resorts be  --  fore we settled at Snowmass ; Aspen , Utah , then Vermont . But what I like about where we are is that our place is part of what 's going on . We 're not just sitting somewhere on a hill to the side : we 're right in there where the action is . I like that . I like being part of things . " Her general philosophy may he somewhat influenced by that of Dr. Norman Vincent Peale , who , inci  --  dentally , married Lucy and Gary . " Every day is a new beginning to me . I like to be needed , I like to work , I like to get up in the morning and have something to do . I do n't like the idea of nothing to do . I like to earn a little vacation , but I do n't like to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Lib ? I do n't think I un  --  derstand the ones who are flam  --  boyant and screaming and yelling . I do n't really know what the hell they want except to be noticed . Of course I have been so liberated that it hurts . I have had so much to do that 's man 's work that I 'm always very grateful for the kind of man I 'm mar  --  ried to now , who is protective and really cares about home and family and taking care and watching the growth within the home rather than whatever is outside . No grass is greener to the man I 'm married to now , Gary is unusual in that way . " People ask me about the kids in my show . When I put them in the show , it had to do with the schools they were in at the time . My first rea  --  son for taking them out of school was that I did n't dig the schools -I did n't dig what what was happening in schools . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , trapped children . They were both in Catholic schools , which was fine and high scholastically , but they were not working to their po  --  tential . But the way they kept up their musical studies and everything having to do with my profession showed what they really could do . Finally l asked them do you want to be part of my show . And I said this will mean being taken out of your schools and being tutored . But , when they finally got a tutor and spent some time on it , they really got into books and accomplished some  --  thing and found their direction . Lucie loved our kind of comedy . Desi learned the business and learned what it was to be a trouper and be there and knew his lines and all that , but he always had an eye for the more dramatic things . So he went out to find it by himself . He 's play  --  ing Marco Polo now in a picture made in Japan , and soon he 'll appear with Gregory Peck in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , but he 's found what he wants . " I worry about young people . I think that the last six years  --  six or seven years-1 think what they call the lost generation has finally found that it was really lost . It took quite a time , and now you see them going back to the basic . They 're weaving , they 're digging the water from the ground and they do n't even want a spigot that runs . It was n't that the kids have made such a mess of them  --  selves . But our general permissive  --  ness has put so much of a load on their shoulders that it has just been unbelievable what these young peo  --  ple are expected to decide for them  --  selves . They do n't get much help . " I can not believe that young peo  --  ple are going into the movie theaters and having to look at life the way it is being shown  --  everything is so hope  --  less , without imagination , without hope , without fantasy . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The picturemakers are making up their minds , and the people on stage , and so the books that we are reading . So now the kids have got to go out and learn for themselves . I just hope that they can . " Television may have to share some of the blame for making up the kids ' minds for them , but not all . Of course , there it is all the time . Televi  --  sion is a line strung between homes ; it brings reality into your home . But when they blamed television for the violence , and television for too much permissiveness , too much sex and all that , then I do n't go along with it . But there have been good TV things , too . There 's been a lot of comedy , a lot of musical things , and a lot of art . Many things on television are disre  --  garded because the real live broad  --  casts of war and tragedy and the news every night top everything else . I do n't know any answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sake of killing , but I can not blame it on television . I do n't know anything to blame it on . I do n't know what causes it  --  I 'm not that bright . But , in my thinking , this lost generation is not just seeking thrills , they 're seek  --  ing recognition . Any recognition . Because I watch what happens after they 're caught . They want to be caught , they want to be photo  --  graphed , they want you to know what they did . And then they make up a story as to why they did it . It 's not necessarily the truth as to why they did it . It could be that what they all need is a little more atten  --  tion from the right kind of people . " Now it is time to go , and Lucy is ready to meet with her choreograph  --  er from Marne . The next day it will be another specialist from the show  --  she believes in doing things thoroughly . There is no horsing around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point . She shows me out in a kind of zig  --  zag pattern around the house , point  --  ing to the beautifully bound volumes containing tapes of all her shows . There are many books on art in view , with a special emphasis on Andrew Wyeth . And now I suddenly realize that every wall in the house is crammed with paintings . They are not arranged : they are simply jammed on the walls in a profusion of subjects and color . Her favorite artist is clearly DeCachard , who by chance happens to be related to the Bouvier clan of Jackie Bouvier Ken  --  nedy Onassis fame . There may be a story to their origin , but I do not seek for it , because I am more in  --  terested in the mood of these paint  --  ings . They are impressionistic , very often in a Parisian vein  --  the Opera House in the rain , Montmartre , a tiny cafe . And as I watch this fabu  --  lously successful businesswoman , this skilled and seasoned stage per  --  former , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this veteran performer still zesty for new triumphs , I catch something deep in her spirit . Lucille Ball is a dreamer at heart , a girl sitting on the wooded bank of a lake in upstate New York , filled with the belief that the world is good , and that tomorrow it surely will be better . n INTEROFFICE MEMORANDUM To : Harold Flint Vice President  --  Chief Financial Officer From : Robert Cratch Comptroller Subject : Internal Audit Procedures Attached to this memo you will find a detailed summary of the inves  --  tigative procedures undertaken by the internal audit staff since you first notified us of a possible embezzle  --  ment .
