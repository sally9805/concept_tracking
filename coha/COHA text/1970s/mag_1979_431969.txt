 | Admitting her addiction to alcohol was only the beginnin of Mrs. Edward Kennedy 's courageous story . There is more ? much more JOAN KENNEDY 'S Road Back from Alcoholism To most of us , the word " alcoholism " awakens feelings of disgust , revulsion and sometimes ? but only sometimes ? pity . The alcoholic is portrayed on television , in novels and in the movies as a failure and a burden on society . It took great courage , therefore , for Joan Kennedy to hold her head high and publicly admit , " I am an alcoholic . " When she did this last year , she took her first step on the long road back from alcoholism . The road back to sobriety is never easy . I like to think of it as trying to climb a steep , icy hill . You go up part of the way and then you may slip down a bit . But by grabbing hold , you inch up slowly , a little further than you were before until , hopefully , you reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizen in that Kennedy Camelot of the early ' 60s , wife of a U.S. senator , sister-in-law to two martyred leaders , potential heiress to the First Lady 's throne , was an alcoholic . And , as she will be the first to admit , she still is an alcoholic . Many people find it difficult to understand how Joan , the golden girl who seemed to have everything , turned out to have a drinking problem . Alcoholism is not just a problem ; it is a disease . Recent studies have even indicated there could be a genetic factor involved , making some of us succumb to this illness more easily than others . As a result , alcoholism is a danger to women in every walk of life just as it is to men . Not too long ago , women comprised only one fourth of the country 's alcoholics . Today they total about one third . ( For more about women and alcohol see page 73 . ) A great many of them are women who moved out to the suburbs when they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead absolutely perfect lives . But their children grew up and moved on , their husbands became absorbed in work and these women were left with lonely , empty lives . We all know that loneliness sometimes leads to drinking ( or to drugs ) , and before too long the occasional drink can become an addiction . Joan Kennedy , too , may have expected that she would lead a perfect life . When she first arrived in Washington , she was 26 years old ; she had one brother-in-law who was President of the United States and the other was Attorney General . Her husband had just been elected Senator from Massachusetts . She lived in a world of excitement , glamour , money and newspaper headlines . It sounds thrilling ? but the pressures of such a life can be enormous . Judging from what I 've read , Joan had a very sheltered childhood . She was a serious , quiet little girl who worked hard at school and did her best to please her parents . Sometimes , however , like a lot of insecure children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was very shy . Though extremely pretty , she rarely dated during most of her high school years . She thought her younger sister , Candy ? outgoing , popular , with boys always clustered around ? was the special one . Even after Joan met and married Ted Kennedy she once admitted , " I always used to say that Ted should have married Candy . " When Joan attended Manhattanville College of the Sacred Heart , she began to come into her own . She was popular and seemed selfassured . She also started a modeling career which led her into television commercials on the Eddie Fisher  | Show and The $64,000 Question and she was on the Perry Como Show for about a year . Then a college friend , Jean Kennedy , introduced Joan to her youngest brother , Ted , and Joan 's life began to revolve around him . She was 22 years old when they married in 1958 and she had every reason to feel that her life was going to be sheltered and happy . But she soon found herself living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did whatever she could to help when her brother-in-law John F. Kennedy ran for the Presidency in 1960 . Two years later , when Ted ran for the Senate for the first time , her campaigning chores intensified . I imagine she must have felt very nervous , but she did it ? and did it well . At age 26 , Joan Kennedy went to Washington , the wife of the youngest U.S. senator in history . Her children , first Kara , then Teddy , Jr. , were born ( Patrick came along later ) . Ted installed his family in a rented house in Georgetown and later in a home they built in McLean , Va . The storybook marriage had moved into an even more fairytale phase . When John Kennedy was so tragically killed , everyone was stricken . But Joan was dazed and for several days would n't leave her home or even her bedroom . Afterwards , she tried valiantly to pick up the pieces and go on as usual . But the glamour , the excitement that had been so compelling just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demands of Washington , of being a political wife , seemed more burdensome . I also think Joan might have felt a little overawed at the energy and enthusiasm of the other Kennedy women . Joan was sensitive and felt things deeply . She was not as athletic as the rest of the Kennedys . Like her sister-in-law Jacqueline she needed time alone with herself , while her in-laws thrived on always being together . Above all , Joan suffered several miscarriages . Of A course , she was aware that the Kennedys produced large families . Sister-in-law Ethel seemed to have babies so easily , and her mother-in-law , Rose Kennedy , had had nine children . Had Rose Kennedy not had nine , Joan 's Ted , who was the youngest , would not have been born . So Joan just kept trying to have more babies . Despite these problems , whenever Ted needed her , his wife marshaled her strength and gave her all . When he was immobilized with a broken back after an airplane crash , she went out and campaigned for him alone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Senate , he said that his wife had " won " it for him . Then Bobby Kennedy was killed and once again Joan went through that awful shock . But now there was another burden to bear : she was terrified that Ted would be next . And Ted , as the male head of the Kennedy clan , bore the responsibilities for the family . He was surrogate father to his brothers ' children and he had pledged to " pick up the torch " for his fallen brothers . He seemed to have less time for Joan , for their family , for their life together . Their third child , Patrick , was born . But rumors about Ted and other women were also born , rumors that simply would n't go away and that were not easy for Joan to shrug off or ignore . Then Chappaquiddick happened . Joan was five months  | pregnant at the time of the tragic incident and she miscarried again . After this , she decided to stop trying to have another baby . She had three healthy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason for trying to keep up with Rose and Ethel . But the horror of Chappaquiddick went on . It served to open up a flood of rumors about Ted and other women . Joan says that she never believed the stories , but she admits that they hurt her nonetheless . " I did n't lose all my self-esteem , " she says , but it was difficult to hear all the rumors . I began to think , well , maybe I 'm just not attractive enough . " When she was feeling that way , a drink ? or a few drinks ? could soothe the pain . Before she even realized what was happening , she was addicted . I think it 's vitally important for women to be able to express their feelings openly to their husbands . Joan could n't do this . She was completely unable to let Ted know how she felt about the stories . So she tried to swallow her anger and hurt with liquor . Like so many unhappy women , Joan Kennedy was using alcohol to escape . she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself , so she signed up for some college courses in Washington . But she was still determined " to he ready to go anywhere and accommodate myself to my husband 's schedule . " So if the demands of being Ted 's wife conflicted with her classes , she simply skipped the classes to be with him . One time she missed a final exam because she was out of town . Another time she could n't deliver a scheduled midterm paper because of an unexpected trip with Ted . Finally she dropped the courses . Her husband 's career , and her family , came first . The demands on a politician ? and his family ? are enormous . There is little time for family privacy . When there is not a governmental affair to attend , there is a social gathering of one kind or another . On one evening , it might be to raise campaign funds . On another , it might be for support for some piece of legislation . On still another , it might be to maintain voter good will . Joan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we approach the 1980s , most politicians ' families try to appear " perfect . " In the ' 60s and early ' 70s when Joan was building up to her crisis , it was deemed absolutely necessary for Ted 's career for him and Joan to behave as if everything were perfect . Thus Joan , who wanted to see a psychiatrist for help , was afraid that someone might find out , make the news public and cause a scandal . But incidents that may have been little warning signs of her plight were causing talk . One time she made headlines when she appeared at the Nixon White House in a miniskirt while all the other women wore long gowns . On another occasion , she wore a see-through blouse with her bra clearly showing through . From a psychological point of view , she may have been crying out for help . But nobody was listening . When she finally did see a psychiatrist , she bravely announced it to the press herself . But she says now that the doctor she went to was n't trained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help her . Her decline was so slow , she hardly realized what was happening . Looking back , she now says she would drink to drown out an unpleasant thought or to help herself cope with the pressures . In her position , there were all sorts of mini-crises and excuses for taking a drink . There were large-scale tragedies too , and her reaction to those was in  | some ways surprising and in others very predictable . W hen , at age 12 , her son Teddy , Jr . had bone cancer , she stayed completely sober . She was in Europe when the cancer was discovered , and she hurriedly flew home to his bedside . When she got to the hospital and the doctors explained that they had to amputate his leg to stop the cancer from spreading , she put her head on her husband 's shoulder and wept . But then she quickly pulled herself together . She was the brave , compassionate mother from start to finish , and it was only after Teddy was safely back in school and on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relief . When she was asked to play piano on Andy Williams ' TV show , she started practicing three months before the scheduled appearance . For those three months , she did n't touch a drop of liquor , but after the show she just started drinking again . There is simply no way of knowing why some people collapse at the outset of a difficult situation , while others get through it and then falter . It used to be easier for women than men to hide their alcoholism , because men had to go to work and had to maintain acceptable levels of social behavior . Most women stayed at home . Getting by under the influence of alcohol is far easier in the confines of one 's home than it is in the business world . For Joan Kennedy it was a slight auto accident that brought her problem out in the open . She then entered Silver Hill in Connecticut ? a well-known and well-respected private treatment center . For a while after that she was all right . But once she was back home in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had , she began to slowly slip down that icy hill again . Most of us still believe that alcoholism is a weakness , even though we have no more right to make that judgment than we do to make such a charge about a person who has a predisposition to tuberculosis . Some people are just not meant to drink and when they do , they ca n't stop . But studies indicate that alcoholism does n't just happen . There must be a trigger to set it off . There are probably many men and women among us who are predisposed to alcoholism but who will never suffer from it because they have developed positive ways of dealing with that trigger . That is the heart of the issue : How we deal with life and its ups and downs . Those who rely on alcohol are not dealing with it successfully . Those who have overcome a drinking problem have found an answer . Joan Kennedy knew that she needed an answer and she entered an alcoholic-rehabilitation center in New York to get help . When she left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she had been there ? and why . What a terrible heartache that must have been . Soon afterwards , her mother died . It was a great blow to Joan . " I thought it was the end of the world when my mother died , " she said . She was scheduled to play the piano with the National Symphony in Washington shortly afterwards and her first reaction was to cancel the performance . Then she decided that her best therapy would be work and she went ahead with the concert . B y now , Joan was determined to overcome her drinking problem . She made up her mind to get away from the pressures in Washington by moving to Boston and  | enrolling in school full time to earn her Master of Education degree . For the first time in her adult life she was pursuing her own goals . She did n't think of going to Boston as running away from Washington and she certainly was n't running from her husband . " I was making a forward step for myself , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first valiant step . Families who hide a member 's alcoholism from one another or from the rest of the world are doing the alcoholic a disservice . First , the problem must be faced by the person who is troubled with it . Then the healing can start to take place . I know that for some individuals , it takes a bounce along " rock bottom " to come to the realization that things have gone too far . For others , it requires a crisis . Joan had both . Moving into an apartment in Boston , she found the quiet ? and the relative anonymity ? she needed and wanted . She discovered that she could go to school and be praised , not because she is a Kennedy , but because she is bright , personable and a good student . Setting goals and pursuing them is a key to an alcoholic 's recovery , and Joan Kennedy did exactly what she had to do . When she has her Master 's degree from Lesley College in Cambridge , Mass. , she believes she will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a job in her field of music . " That 's important for a lot of women my age , " she says . " And that 's something only I can do . My friends , my family , the Kennedys ? all the things that I have going for me ? ca n't take an exam for me . I have to do it ! " She has faced the realization that the only one who can rescue Joan Kennedy is Joan Kennedy . She is patiently and proudly rebuilding her life on a more solid foundation than before . Most important , she is apparently reaching out for ? and receiving ? the love , interest and attention of her husband and three children . Now she is closer , even though separated physically , to her husband and children . She sees them every weekend and Ted flies to Boston during the week and they actually date . They 've at last found time to be together and they like it . I can remember a time when Joan was in mortal fear that her husband might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conference to announce that he would not run , she wept open tears of relief . Now he is again being mentioned as a presidential contender and she faces the prospect calmly . " That 's his decision , " she says . " I 'll do what I can to help him , but I 'd have to make my own rules about where I 'd go and what I 'd say . " Alcoholism can be defeated . Joan Kennedy has taken a giant step toward that goal . If we ever hear that Joan has slipped down the icy hill a bit , it will be very important to remember that such a slip is not the end of the world . It will be even more important for Joan to understand this and to start to climb up again . Once she has firmly assumed her own space and has merged it with her husband 's ? without again losing her own identity ? she will have come all the way back to the top of the hill .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
