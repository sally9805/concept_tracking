Despite faltering stocks and burgeoning bankruptcies , America still has at least one growth industry . The " T-groups , " encounters , marathons and " sensitivity training " workshops that make up the so-called human-potential movement still spread across the landscape like real estate developments in Southern California . Like any expanding commercial ( or social ) movement , " human potential " is creating its own mythology and literature , of which the four books considered here are probably typical . John Mann portrays a semi-fictional " weekend with intimate strangers , " into which the reader is supposed to be drawn as a quasi-active participant . Using both dialogue and interior monologue , he tries hard to create characters believable enough for his readers to get involved with ; had he been a skilled novelist , he just might have brought it off . Unfortunately , he is n't . Shepard and Lee , covering much the same ground , are more modest in their aim and succeed far better . They do not explicitly seek to " involve " the reader , merely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transcriptions of one . The result has all the banality , humor , bathos and nuttiness of real life . Some of the participants are likable , some ( like - " Little Prince , " a self-dramatizing female flower child ) are irritating , some ( like " Bernard , " a humorless , sex-obsessed pathologist ) are plain tedious . Nothing terribly dramatic happens , and . at the end nobody 's life seems to have been radically changed , but the reader is left with the conviction that this was indeed the weekend that was . Jane Howard , in her " guided tour of the human-potential movement , " has turned in a first-rate job of journalism  --  perceptive , often witty , and with a fine balance between the necessary ingredients of personal involvement and professional detachment . She did not cover all the ground or ask all the important questions , but her book is still the best available introduction to what she accurately calls an " epidemic of . . . programs , reminiscent at once of systems analysis and social science and snake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtues is her clear awareness that the snake oil is there , that human potential , like any business , has its share  --  probably a bit more than its share -- of phonies and fast-buck operators . Barbara Leslie Austin , the " sad nun " of her atrociously alliterative title , has produced a very personal account of a summer spent teaching , and learning , at Synanon , the famous center for addict rehabilitation which is now rapidly becoming the home of a cult . The main theme of her story  --  a sensitive young nun 's discovery of her own sexuality  --  is perceptively and delicately conveyed , but is perhaps a bit too specialized a subject for wide appeal . More interesting to me were her reactions to Synanon itself . Reading them , I was suddenly struck by the group 's resemblance to a Marine Corps boot camp . There is the same ritualized obscenity-41eading to what might be called the cheapening of dirty words . There is the same sadistic hazing of the new recruit , and the same intense in-group loyalty and contempt for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are judged in terms of how much " support " they give their . men , or  --  in MiSs Austin 's case , and to her understandable irritation  --  whether they have been had by a man . There is , finally ( and to an even greater extent than in most armies ) the carriere ouverte aux talents , in which every , junkie-recruit carries a Trip Leader 's or Administrator ' ? baton in his knapsack . Like the Army , Synanon can " make a man out of " mighty unpromising human material  --  the junkies , winos , and other losers who are too immature to function outside an authoritarian and tightly structured environment . The rest of us are likely to find it , as did Miss Austin ( she is no longer . a nun ) , an interesting and educational place to visit but hardly one to live in . We may also wonder , as she evidently does , whether there is n't something amiss with the human potential of a group where " casual sex is almost the rule , kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . is commended , " one that operates Lyon the dogmatic assumption that " you ca n't have much love unless you have an equal amount of hate . " For good os evil , however , Synanon is not really typical of the groups described in the other three books . Just what are they , what sort of people do they appeal to , and what  --  if anything ? do they do for their participants or for society at large ? Glancing through Miss Howard 's useful appendix of " Growth , centers and kindred establishments , " one finds them ranging from individual enterprises such as Nexus ( El Cajon , Calif. ) and Center Of Man ( Micanopy , Fla. ) to the large and corporate National Training Laboratories , which in addition to its Washington , D.C. , headquarters maintains branches in Missouri , Oregon , Maine , Utah ( two ) and California ( two ) . Nearly all the groups ? NTL being a major exception  --  are concentrated in California and the New York metropolitan area  --  which are the two centers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The implications of geography are confirmed by the fact that people met in the pages of Howard , Mann , and Shepard and Lee are virtually all white , upper middle class and prosperous . Considering that exploring one 's potential in these groups requires both leisure and money , this selectivity is hardly surprising ; what is surprising is the fact that neither the groups nor their members seem at all aware of just how selective they are . ( Mike Murphy , founder of Esalen Institute , once wrote with delicious naivete of his clients : " They come from all walks of life , from businesses , universities , law offices , kitchens  --  and from Haight Asbury sic . " ) Even more unexpected are the things that trouble  --  and , especially , do n't trouble  --  these affluent people . They worry , about their feelings toward their marital or quasi-marital partners , about whether they are enjoying sex enough , or with the right person , or with too many or too few people ; they worry about whether their buttocks are too big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the other hand , seems to have problems with his kids , to be trapped in a dull or meaningless job or a suburban kitchen , to be oppressed by stultifying institutions or a nasty boss . At this point my credence expires ; I simply do n't believe that even the highly selected people involved in potential seeking are quite so restricted in their problems . If they see their difficulties as overwhelmingly personal ( and mainly sexual ) , as involving the self in isolation from society , the reason , I , suggest , is that the ideology , techniques and leadership ' of the therapy groups have imposed tunnel vision upon them . The human-potential movement appears to operate mostly on the assumption that what matters is how you feel about yourself ; how the other , individuals and groups in your world feel about you , what they do to you or for you , and . what you do to them , . are  --  at best ? matters of secondary importance . It 's all in the mind  --  your mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and therefore , of course , in what it finds ) ' is likely to improve the lives of its participants significantly , is arguable ; whether in fact it has improved anyone 's life is not arguable because the data do not exist . Of all the people ' mentioned in these three books , I recall not one concerning whom I could be reasonably clear about what was wrong with his life before he entered a group or how it had improved ( or how long the improvement lasted ) afterward . Oddly enough , some leaders in the human-potential field are even more dubious than I about the value of what they , or at least their competitors , are ' doing . Thus Robert Blake , a partner in Scientific Methods , Inc. ( which does it all with charts , rating scales and something called " Grid labs " ) ' says flatly : " Human relations training that mucks around with ' emotion gives people a walloping good cathartic time , but it is n't worth a tinker 's damn " I rather think he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself ' thinks he is doing , it he is n't mucking around with emotion  --  apart , that is , from getting rich ( he is reputed to be the only behavioral scientist who has made a million ) . Of course , the thanes wrought by , groups in their participants are , inevitably , elusive and hard to assess objectively . And if , ' as Miss Howard says , much of the existing research on the subject is " inconclusive , contradictory , and written in lamentable style , " these qualities are rather widely found in social science research of all sorts . What is more troubling is that some leaders of human-potential groups seem quite unconcerned about the lack of information on what they are accomplishing . " The only data that really count , " said one , " is whether the guy liked it or not . " By this standard , at least , the groups are a , whacking success , Most participants do like the experience , and many are moved to repeat it as often as possible . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The most predictable behavioral change is that they 'll be back next year . " , Or , in the words of one inveterate grouper , " It 's a pretty safe $300 a year habit , " Whatever else the groups are doing , they are rapidly replacing psychoanalysis  --  and . supplementing pot  --  as the opium of the sophisticated middle class . By the same token , the more conservative , , " organizational development " wing of the movement ( which includes Blake 's Scientific Methods , Inc. ) appears to be replacing motivational research as the opium of the corporate bureaucrats  --  a new kind of reassurance that they really knov , what they 're doing and why , apart from profits and capital gains , they 're doing it . . ( Not that balance-sheet considerations are excluded ; Leland Bradford of National Training Laboratories has said of his corporate clients that " in almost every case the stock of the company has gone up " ? a boast that may not have survived the ' current recession . ) ' Yet though much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for affluence , personal or corporate , I think it would be a mistake to drop the matter there . Religion , as we have learned from the examples of Martin Luther , King and Pope John XXIII , need not be opium ; it can awaken as well as tranquilize . And human potential , I think , possesses its own awakening , even radicalizing potential , though few of its practitioners seem aware of the fact . ( This thought will come as do surprise to the radical Right , which , as Miss Howard notes , already sees the movement , as a Communist-inspired blend of brainwash and sex orgy . Here as elsewhere , the Right credits the Left with far more enterprise than it actually possesses . The notion that American Communists of any sort would have the imagination to employ human-potential techniques could ' occur only to a Bircher . ) The liberating possibilities of human-potential groups is suggested by a number of things . First , there are the unfortunate experiences that some corporations have had with it . A Wall Street Journal survey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Howard 's words , " went into T-groups autocratic , tough , and competitive , and came back so radically changed that they lost their jobs . " According to the Journal , many corporations have therefore " turned away from the free-swing , ing , traditional T-groups to carefully planned sessions dealing . . . with specific company problems . " And a General Electric spokesman is quoted as saying flatly that sensitivity training must be , " designed to change an individual , not necessarily change , the environment he works in " ? to whittle the peg , not redrill the hole . A movement that can , even occasionally , radically , change autocratic , tough businessmen ca n't be written off as merely a toy ; what 's bad for , General Electric may be good for the rest of the country . A prototype of what a radicalizing human-potential movement might be like can be found in the " consciousness-raising " activities of some Women 's Liberation groups . These meetings , as near as 1 can make out ( I have not , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devoted to discussing the participants ' experiences as women , and in particular the personal frustrations and injustices they have suffered on account of their sex . With admirable con ; creteness , they concentrate on the particulars of their own lives , as a means of understanding the problems of women in general . A still earlier analogue can be found in a device invented by the Chinese Communists ( now , of course , swept away by the cult of Chairman Mao ) ? the " speak bitterness " meeting . Here , peasants were encouraged to recolint publicly their own mistreatment at the hands of landlords and bureaucrats , as a way of strengthening i the entire village 's determination to resist oppression . In both cases , clearly , the aim is much the same as in many human-potential groups : to release people 's real 1 feelings about themselves and their lives . But the politicalized groups do much more , for they seek to focus the released feelings of anger , frustration and bitterness on the specific individuals and institutions that have engendered ' them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The human-potential and consciousness-raising groups , both deal with people who ? feel that , in one way or another , they have been short-changed-by life . But where the former says , in effect , " You 've really been short-changing yourself , " the latter says , " You 've been short-changed by society " ? and spells out the specific social patterns and institutions that are responsible . A human-potential group that does not recognize explicitly and specifically that ' the problems of its members deriVe at least as much from their social existence as from their consciousness - ( or unconsciousness ) , has limited its own capacity for liberating people . By the same token , a radical group that ignores the particularities of its own members , and fails to base its program and activities on their personal experiences , feelings and needs , will inevitably founder in an ideological morass . ( Marge Piercy , a Women 's Liberation leader and sometime SDS stalwart , believes  --  correctly , I think-that the latter organization 's collapse into jargon and revoluLITERARY CRITICISM : An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rinehart &; Winston . 629 pp. $9.95 .

Again , in his preface , Mr. Trilling stresses that he intends the collection for tionary rhetoric derives in part , at least , from its near-total domination by men . ) The human-potential and consciousness-raising movements both start , . as they should , with the question : What does it mean to be , human  --  and what could it , should it mean ? But the answer is neither wholly general . nor wholly personal . What we need to ask ourselves and our fellows is what it Means to be a teacher , if we are teachers ; to be a doctor , a toolmaker , a cop , a woman , a black man , a black Woman .
