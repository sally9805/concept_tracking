SIX times in the past six months , a grandfatherly , supremely confident executive has swooped into Moscow aboard his private Gulfstream jet for talks with the highest Soviet trade officials . This week Armand Hammer , the 74-year-old chairman of Los Angeles ' Occidental Petroleum , is scheduled to fly there again , with bright hopes of finally signing a major East-West trade deal . It would be an arrangement for Occidental to ship up to 1,000,000 tons of fertilizer per year to the Soviet Union in exchange for urea and ammonia that the company would sell in the U.S. That , Hammer predicts , would lead to a whole series of metal , gas and construction deals with the U.S.S.R. that could run into billions of dollars . He told TIME Correspondent Patricia Delaney that he expects to sign the Soviets to contracts for all these transactions this year . <P> If Hammer succeeds , he will give a spectacular push to the movement toward greater trade between the U.S. and the Soviet Union . In particular , his version of a plan to import vast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy shortage . But a growing legion of skeptics among investment analysts and fellow businessmen will be astonished if Hammer can come back with any major agreement - and even more surprised if he can arrange the financing to carry out his part of a big deal . They note that Occidental , one of the growth wonders of the 1960s , already carries a load of almost $900 million in long-term debt , and has been forced by a deep profit slump to suspend dividends on its common stock for the past year . In their view , Hammer is trying to pull a rabbit out of an astrakhan hat in order to revive his company 's fortunes . <P> Hammer 's expeditions have been surrounded by the most extensive publicity to attend any talks between the Soviets and a U.S. businessman in years , no small amount of it generated by Hammer himself . In the West , he has given glowing descriptions of his negotiations ; in Moscow , his aides have telephoned American newsmen with breathless accounts of his progress . His Soviet trips have won extremely rare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York Times and the Washington Post , and a pair of red-white-and-blue enamel cuff links presented by President Nixon . <P> To date , though , even Hammer claims only one hard deal : an agreement to barter $40 million worth of U.S. machinery for Soviet nickel over the next five years . That works out to a not overly impressive $8,000,000 a year . The only exchange that he has already concluded involved neither money nor commercial products but art works . He donated a Goya portrait to the Hermitage museum in Leningrad and received in return an abstract painting by Kasimir Malevich , whose work is in such deep disfavor among Soviet officials that it has not been exhibited in more than 40 years .
