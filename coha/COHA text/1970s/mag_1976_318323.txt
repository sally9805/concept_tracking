It has become a profoundly perplexing question for doctors and , indeed , all of society : Should heroic measures-respirators and other marvels of modern medical technology-be used to prolong the lives of the dying who no longer want to live ? Last week California gave its answer . It became the first state to legalize the right of the terminally ill to decree their own deaths . <P> Signed into law by Governor Jerry Brown , an ex-Jesuit seminarian , after weeks of personal agonizing , the California bill implicitly recognizes the validity of " living wills . " Long a subject of debate , these are documents in which a patient directs doctors to " pull the plug , " in effect , if life-sustaining procedures serve no other purpose than to postpone the moment of death . Under the California legislation , such directives can now be drafted by any adult , must be witnessed by two people who are neither related to the patient nor involved in his medical treatment , and must be renewed every five years . Then , beginning Jan. 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the patient is hopelessly ill , life-sustaining machinery can be shut off without any legal repercussions for the physicians or the patient 's family . <P> Passed by a 43-to-25 vote in the California assembly after a bitter fight , the bill gained significant support in the wake of the case of Karen Anne Quinlan , the New Jersey girl who slipped into an apparently irreversible coma . Karen 's parents spent six months battling for her right to die with dignity. * Though the California bill specifically disavows " mercy killing " and allows anyone designated by the patient to rescind the death directive , California 's pro-life forces strenuously opposed the measure as the first step toward euthanasia . Said one Democratic assemblyman , Vincent Thomas : " The trend seems to be to get rid of the senile , insane and crippled people . Our next move will be to get rid of everyone . " <P> Ultimate Underdog . Supporters of the bill included the California Medical Association , the American Civil Liberties Union and senior citizens ' groups . The bill 's sponsor , Democrat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and painfully of cancer , says it speaks for the ultimate underdog-those terminally ill " who have no hope , are helpless and for psychological reasons have been isolated . " He is urging other states to follow California 's example . In fact , there have already been attempts to pass similar bills in 17 other states . <P> <P> * The New Jersey Supreme Court approved the removal of the mechanical respirator from Karen last March . Contrary to prognosis , she remains alive in a rest home , though still in a coma .
