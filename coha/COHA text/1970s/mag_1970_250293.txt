Of the 5,400 people that the Libbey-Owens-Ford Co. employs to make glass in Toledo , only 200 are members of the " minority " group that makes up more than half the city 's population . Just like their fellow workers , they want overtime pay and a crack at the tough jobs that lead to advancement . But because they are women , a state law bars them from working more than nine hours a day or six days a week and from regularly lifting more than 25 lbs . The women also charge that company policy makes them the last hired and first fired . Taking their side last week , the U.S. Justice Department filed its first suit demanding an end to such job discrimination . <P> The Ohio law resembles those enacted by many states at the turn of the century to protect the " weaker " sex from harsh working conditions . Now a growing band of lawyers argue that if the laws are used to bar women who want such work , the result is precisely the kind of discrimination forbidden by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ban on sex discrimination was added to that law as a wry joke by Southern Congressmen opposing civil rights for blacks , complaints involving women now make up nearly one-quarter of those brought to the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission . <P> No Conciliation . The Libbey-Owens-Ford case was started by Mrs. Nancy Raitz , 35 , a former $2.50-an-hour assembler . Last year she and 32 other female employees complained to the EEOC . The company argued that it was merely obeying the state law . When the commission 's conciliation attempts failed , it recommended that the Justice Department bring a full-scale court test . <P> The suit charges Libbey-Owens-Ford and the United Glass and Ceramic Workers of North America and its Local 9 with barring women workers at some of the company 's Toledo plants . Women who get hired in other plants , the suit charges , are restricted to " less desirable and lower-paying jobs , " and " subjected to a high frequency of layoff . " <P> Self-Reliance . In deciding the case , the U.S. district court in Toledo could hold that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could also take up the question of whether " female-protective " laws violate the 14th Amendment 's guarantee of equal protection to " any person " or its insistence on due process for all . For years , lower courts have upheld separate treatment for women , often citing a 1908 Supreme Court decision that approved different standards for the sexes because of differences " in structure of body , amount of physical strength and in self-reliance . " In a new case to be heard next fall , however , the court may accept the feminist idea that distinctions based on sexual stereotypes are no more valid than the racial ones that once justified segregation . <P> Emerging standards for women 's rights are likely to leave some jobs in which employers can insist on sex as a bona fide occupational qualification . Though telephone companies have been obliged to hire male operators and bars to take on female bartenders , the EEOC has ruled that actresses can still monopolize female roles-and presumably , jobs as topless dancers . Eventually , says University of New Mexico Law Professor Leo Kanowitz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether , if women have equal rights , they also have equal liability to be drafted .
