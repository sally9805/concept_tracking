HERBIE RIDES AGAIN <P> Directed by ROBERT STEVENSON Screenplay by BILL WALSH <P> Although the leading actress in this one-horse farce is Helen Hayes , a nice old lady who lives in a firehouse , the real star is a car called Herbie . He is a Volkswagen Beetle who , befitting a Disney Studios creation , does wheelstands when people insult him or transports them to trysting places as the mood takes him . <P> Herbie Rides Again is a sequel to The Love Bug , wherein Herbie made his debut . Kids gobble up the automotive anthropomorphism and hardly seem to notice that the movie lacks the craftsmanship that used to be a Disney trademark . Parents-or fathers , anyway - may take some consolation from the presence of Stefanie Powers , who is more sprightly and more shapely than the Disney folks usually allow .
