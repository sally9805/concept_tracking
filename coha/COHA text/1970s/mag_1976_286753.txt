In a large green-carpeted hall jammed with college students , flashing phones and clacking keypunch machines , Columbia University Student John Perrotta took the first call from Wisconsin at precisely 9:07 p.m . Perrotta pulled out a coded sheet of paper and quickly penciled in the totals : 133 votes for Gerald Ford ; 83 for Ronald Reagan . He noted the call had come from Milwaukee 's Fifth Congressional District and handed the sheet to a dungaree-clad coed , who took it to a bank of keypunch operators . <P> Within three minutes the vote total was punched , scanned , electronically sent to a computer bank , fed into its system and moved by high-speed teletype to the nation 's wire services and television networks . By the time Perrotta 's phone blinked again , hundreds of other students , technicians and supervisors at two locations in New York City were gathering , sorting and sending out the Wisconsin and New York State votes to their customers . <P> The little-known agency responsible for this flow of information is a press cooperative called News Election Service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ television 's dramatic ( last week erroneously dramatic ) election-night projections , since what it provides is nothing but actual votes . The cooperative was born in the ' 60s out of television 's pressure for late-night vote counts that , network executives felt , the wire services were not collecting fast enough . In 1964 the networks badly botched primary coverage . In a tight Goldwater-Rockefeller race in California , network forecasters , relying on competitively reported returns from the state 's 31,000 polling places , ringingly declared both Goldwater and Rockefeller the winner-depending on which channel one was watching . <P> Haunting Presence . As a result , the three networks and two wire services gave up competitive vote counting and formed NES as a nonprofit cooperative under the direction of Associated Press Newsman J. Richard Eimers . By the fall of 1964 Eimers had organized a network of thousands of poll " reporters , " plus an election-night headquarters staff of hundreds of students and technicians . Today he still directs the system , haunting each election-night performance with his demanding presence . <P> To bring in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army of 350 temporary headquarters workers and 75 police telephone operators ( by law , only police can tally New York City vote counts directly from the polls ) , plus 57 county reporters who phoned in the upstate election results . More than half the ballots were tabulated by 11 p.m. , and by midnight 77% of the vote was in . " It 's a first-class operation , " says CBS 's Warren Mitofsky , who heads that network 's national-election unit . " NES was probably the only organization in New York State that really knew what was on the ballot . " <P> For this service the subscribers pay a lot-more than $3 million in combined costs this year . " It 's expensive , " admits U.P.I. 's assistant managing editor , William R. Barrett , " but there really is n't an alternative . " Official results take weeks to tabulate . The News Election Service is the most sophisticated system yet for bringing unofficial-but correct - vote totals to an eager public .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
