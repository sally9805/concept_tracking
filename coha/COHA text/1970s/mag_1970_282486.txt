The U.S. Army in Viet Nam long used a defoliant known as " Agent Orange " without qualms as a crop-killing spray . Purpose : to deny food to enemy forces . Last year a secret study sponsored by the National Cancer Institute raised grave doubts about a prime ingredient in Orange , the chemical compound 2,4,5-T . When the substance was fed in small doses to laboratory rats and mice , 80% of their offspring were stillborn , and 39% of the survivors were deformed . <P> Because Orange only reduces plant yield by two-thirds , individual plants , though tainted , often look edible . Therefore , the study clearly suggests , the Army was inadvertently poisoning civilians as well as enemy soldiers . Government officials classified the report . But after concerned environmentalists and scientists brought the report to light , the Department of Defense on April 15 officially suspended the use of Agent Orange in Viet Nam . <P> No Milkshakes . In Saigon last week , the Army admitted that some of its units have been using Agent Orange despite the suspension . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to TIME-was Ronald Ridenhour , the former Army Ranger whose letters to Congress started the investigation into the My Lai massacre . Now a freelance journalist , Ridenhour recently spent ten days visiting the Americal Division in Chu Lai , where he began hearing rumors about the continuing use of Agent Orange . <P> When Ridenhour asked Captain John Morrison , commanding officer of the 90th Chemical Detachment , whether his unit had used Orange since the suspension , Morrison firmly replied : " None whatsoever . I 've used nothing but Blue* defoliant . " By contrast , Morrison 's enlisted men told Ridenhour that Agent Orange has been sprayed since April on hundreds of acres of farmland in the highlands of Quang Ngai province . As evidence , they pointed to the fact that 145 barrels of the chemical were carried on their unit 's books , but only 40 were actually on hand . What happened to the missing barrels ? " We sprayed a lot of it , " said David Church , a 21-year-old draftee from Pawtucket , R.I. " Hell , we 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beckner of Spokane , Wash . Remarked another soldier : " If we ai n't been using it , where do you think those missing barrels went ? We sure ai n't been making milkshakes out of it . " <P> The men of the 90th Chemical Detachment claim that Orange has been sprayed by other units in the Americal Division as well as their own . The stated reason for spraying the crops-which all belong to Montagnard tribesmen - was that the Army suspects the harvest was being given to the Viet Cong . Knowledgeable observers point out that the traditional ethnic hatred between Montagnards and all other Vietnamese makes it unlikely they would voluntarily supply food to either side . <P> Whose Orders ? In theory , permission to spray defoliants in a given area is granted by General Creighton Abrams , the U.S. Commander in Viet Nam , and by Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker . In practice , orders for individual defoliation missions are given on a much lower level .                    @
