Cause we got a little ol'convoy , Rockin ' through the night , Yeah , we got a little ol'convoy , Ain ' t she a beautiful sight ? <P> Come on an ' join our convoy , Ai n't nothin ' gon na git in our way . We gon na roll this truckin ' convoy , Across the U.S.A. <P> - C.W . McCall <P> It is noon , and Sam Peckinpah is in a good mood when he arrives on the set . " I had half a can of beer for breakfast , " he whispers , " and it tasted great ! " Why does the director of so many he-man shoot-'em-ups whisper ? No one has ever dared to ask , but as a technique it has its advantages . When Peckinpah whispers , people cup their ears and listen-or they may not be around for whisper No. 2 . The mortality rate on the ordinary Peckinpah picture is about half that of lemmings in leap year . <P> But either Peckinpah is not whispering enough on this movie , which is being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much . Or perhaps it is a combination of boredom , dust and the New Mexico sun . At any rate , Peckinpah should have had the rest of the beer because , whatever the problem , the crew of his latest picture , Convoy , is threatening to reverse the usual procedure and quit before being fired . " Either Sam has gone mad or the rest of us have , " says a wardrobe man . Adds a cameraman : " This is a training ground for idiots . We are all out to lunch . " <P> <P> The stars of the film , a saga of CB truckers based on C.W. McCall 's 1975 hit song , are more charitable . " Only Sam knows what he 's doing , but I trust him , " says Ali MacGraw , who is trying to make a movie comeback as a chic photojournalist who falls in love with a trucker . " Sam is like an old dog you sometimes have to apologize for , " says Kris Kristofferson , the trucker Ali falls for . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Talia Shire 's crude , ugly brother in Rocky and who goes by the CB monicker " Pigpen " in Convoy . " Sam 's a pain in the ass , but we all want to be part of his gang . He 's a genius , the bastard . " <P> Out-to-Lunch . Meantime the trusty old dog , bastard , genius , otherwise known by his own CB handle " Iguana , " is besieged by his staff every time he walks out of the hotel or his air-conditioned trailer . The picture is a logistics nightmare , with 28 giant , 18-wheel trucks and 38 other assorted vehicles that have to be maneuvered with military precision , and only the director can say where they are to go . Most of the questions he simply ignores or shrugs off , however , his head shrinking toward his collar like a turtle putting out the OUT-TO-LUNCH sign . Short , hunched , with deep lines across his face , Peckinpah looks older than his 52 years . He always gives the impression that he is being stalked by some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his progeny . In a sense he is ; the monster is half alimony and half child support . " I do n't have the opportunity of turning down pictures , " he whispers . " I have three ex-wives and five children .
