For the past seven years , Minnesota 's Reserve Mining Co. has successfully fought all attempts to stop it from dumping taconite wastes containing asbestos-like fibers into the waters of Lake Superior . Now , Reserve may have reached the end of the line . After having discharged 67,000 tons of wastes into the lake at Silver Bay every day since 1968 , the company has been ordered by U.S. District Judge Edward Devitt to stop the dumping by midnight next July 7 . <P> Devitt 's order will be appealed . But it could mark the end of a fight that began in the 1960s , when it became apparent that the taconite tailings were affecting the nearby waters . They were not , as the company had contended they would , falling harmlessly to the bottom , but dissolving and releasing into the water nutrients that accelerated the growth of algae . Later studies disclosed that the tailings were also rich in asbestos-type fibers , which turned up in the drinking water of nearby communities , most notably Duluth ( pop . 93,000 ) ; asbestos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fibers . <P> Last year an appeals court found that Reserve 's discharges constituted a threat to the health of nearby communities ; it held that the plant could be ordered closed if the state and the company did not agree on an acceptable alternative . Reserve , which is jointly owned by Republic Steel and Armco Steel , said that it could develop a dumping site at a location three miles from Silver Bay . But the state 's Pollution Control Agency argued that this site , which involved the construction of a dam , also posed risks to Silver Bay . It rejected the site and recommended a location 13 miles further from the plant . The company said the second site would be too costly . Faced with the impasse , Devitt started the clock on Reserve . <P> Reserve has reacted angrily to the ruling and , as it has in the past , threatened to close the Silver Bay plant rather than invest in waste-disposal programs that it says could result in an operating loss of $2.3 million per year . Local residents still hope that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would throw 3,200 employees out of work in an area where there are few other jobs . That prospect has already cast a pall over Silver Bay ( pop . 3,500 ) ; nearly every family in town has at least one member working at the Reserve plant . In fact , many of the town 's residents , believing that their community is doomed , fear they will have to apply for welfare . Says Robert Kind , 45 , a Silver Bay councilman and Minnesota state trooper whose job is not dependent on Reserve : " I 'll be around to shut the lights out and shut the town down . "
