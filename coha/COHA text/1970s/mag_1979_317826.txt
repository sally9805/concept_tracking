Carter calls for frugality and restraint <P> The day before Jimmy Carter delivered his State of the Union address , he met at the White House with the House Democratic leaders . He went around the table , asking each for his views on the fiscal 1980 budget . The last to be called on was House Speaker Tip O'Neill . " Mr. Speaker , " said the President , " I save you for last . I 've got to get my marching orders from you . " O'Neill said he had spent more than 40 years fighting for social programs for the poor , and he added : " I did n't become Speaker to strip them . " Replied the President , " I do n't intend to .

" The problems we face today , " said Carter , " are different in nature from those that confronted earlier generations of Americans . They are more subtle , more complex , more interrelated . At home , we are recognizing ever more clearly that government alone can not solve these problems . And abroad , few of them can be solved by the U.S. alone .

" To combat it , he singled out his bill to contain hospital costs ; he claims the legislation would save Americans $60 billion over the next five years . Said he : " There will be no clearer test of the commitment of this Congress to the anti-inflation fight .
