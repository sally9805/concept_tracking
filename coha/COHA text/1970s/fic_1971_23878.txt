a story by Stephen Erhart AS THE HIPPIEST DOCTOR ALMOST GROOVED T HE CORPSMEN ON THE HOSPITAL SHIP are heads , and here is what they know , why they smile in the morning slipping past your bed , why they smile , fey boys , wheeling out the bodies after breakfast . They saw you opened in the light room at the waterline , six surgeons working , four more waiting turns . They saw two at your head , drilling with a power drill , hand-held , good-naturedly cursing when twists of your cranium got stuck , gouging the bone from the bit , joking with the abdomen team as a lathe operator would joke , hearty craftsman ( " How do you like my tools ? " ) , thrusting a strip of wire through the holes , sawing from the inside at the lid on the delicate pudding of your brain , cursing again when the wire broke . They saw your blast-shattered torso split , solar plexus to below the navel , intestine turned out on the green cloth , picked over by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the punctured bottom of a kidney cut away , patched with a piece of your fat . They saw you rinsed , brain and bowel , with the brown solution , then clear water , sucked dry with suction hose , your capillaries cauterized with a met al tip , burned with twelve volts from the machine brand-named Bovie ( some kind of electric cow ? ) They saw two doctors probe at your legs , which were leaking in a hundred places , split them ope : like hot sausages , dig for the pumping arteries an oozing veins , pinch them off with scissors-clamp your blood puddling on the floor under the padde , table . The chief neurosurgeon took a break , stopped b the next operating room : " I wanted to see what good case looked like . This guy in the other room i full of holes . There 's no part of him that 's nc opened up , both legs filleted all the way down . " And another surgeon , who has looked in on yot says to your chief orthopedist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round things with the hob in them , those are arteries , you 're supposed to ti those off , stop the blood from coming out . " " Listen , let me tell ya somethin ' , " ( this doctor a Southerner ) . " When ah went in theah ... " The other doctor climbed up on a chair . " Let 's keep the door closed . We do n't want any of this stuff to get into the operating rooms . " " Listen , ah 'm tryin ' t ' tell ya somethin ' , an ' ya laughin ' at me . Ya hurt mah feelin 's . " The main artery in one of your legs kept spurting blood , they could n't stop it , not till a dozen of the scissors-clamps were snapped onto meaty strips of leg , hanging down in a metal cluster . During the operations you were n't there . Your face was covered with one of the green cloths , your whole body swathed in them , with openings only where the teams were cutting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from the fat wall . scooping at the foliage , flopping it out on the cloth . Your life belonged to the anesthetist , who alone of all those doctors was involved in more than your flesh . He watched your breath and blood , your pulse , kept the black bags pulsing with air , the fluids dripping , faster when the artery burst , the Ringer 's solution , lactated , running clear and pure . " A little faster , " the leg man told him , and he stepped up the flow through your body . They 're in your all now , man , they know you better than your mother ever did . Your body no longer knows itself , but the doctors do , it 's their device . They 've left such pieces as they want of your guts sewed outside the wire stitches , retracking the loops of your bowels , the path of your shit , to regulate and monitor and return to the inside when they will . UT THE CORPSMEN DID N'T TOUCH your flesh . They only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cool white unpropertied brothers ( no sentimental allegory of the superior soul of blacks , this ship ) . There were whites here too who lacked the training and detachment of the doctor , who did n't know how to divide and control , white boys and a Japanese-American . The spades were the voice of them all , from the spades they learned the language , but the white corpsmen and the lap were also there smiling all through the operations ( the doctors did n't know how much they smiled behind those masks , saw only sober eyes that followed the action ) , grooving on color and concept , and on their instruments  --  just keep them sterile and keep them coming , thread the needles and smile cool , unseen , when the doctor asks for long fingers , mosquitoes , umbilical patch stuff . They groove on the sounds of the doctors and their instruments , their drills and saws and suction hose , and afterwards , in the lounge during midrats  --  ham sandwiches , oranges , fresh milk coming out through a rubber tube @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile and listen to their own sounds , on cassette recorders ; they listen to the sounds of the doctors , smile and reply . " More of that acid-rock stuff , " says one of thesurgeons , a lieutenant commander , sprightly , early forties , friendly , keeps up a line of patter , the same doctor who kidded the other about the artery . " You guys had that stuff going pretty late down here last night . You took a long time cleaning up . What time did you secure last night ? Or , I should say , what time did you secure the music ? " " What time did we whe-a-at ? " One of the souls is picking up these sounds , going wild with his smile . " Oh , man , what time did we se-cure the music ? " " Or , I should say ... " The door opens and another soul steps in . " Man , get him outta here , " says the first , who is unrelenting , tyrannically hip . " You know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed it , I changed it . I said ... " " No , man , you bullshittin ' us now . Man , you said .. " The doctor gets a little back later , earns a laugh from the other corpsmen : " Drink some of this milk , " he tells the spade . " It 's good for you , keeps your hair curly . " The retort , not adding anything : " I got natcherly curly hair . " The doctor ca n't leave it alone , does n't know when he 's ahead : " Oh , yeah , naturally curly hair , I forgot about that . " And when the spade exhales wearily and sags back on a sofa , the doctor sets himself down lightly on the edge of a chair , crosses his legs : " This is nothing , " he scoffs . " In Subic we used to do fifteen cases a day . " " Fifteen eases ? You shittin ' me ? Fifteen cases like these ones here ? Fifteen cases a-piece ? How many hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Twenty-four , " he shrugs . " Shee-it . How ' bout tryin ' . sev-enty-two ? Like we done in August . " " 1 could work seventy-two hours too , " the doctor grins , " if I was on pot all the time . " And they all smile , but the doctor is guessing , is n't really sure what 's going on , how much they use the stuff , where it puts their heads . The doctors , of course , are juice freaks , which is just as well , and , for that matter , just as illegal aboard a naval ship at sea . But they need their juice , for their kind of tension would not be relieved by the head-lightening stuff , they need the down-deep sleep of the intelligence that comes with liquor . In the well-lighted room they must be in command , no grooving on color and form , no wows from them , but precision , and only after can they let filter up the consciousness of mortality , then soak it in the calm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PHOTOGRAPHER , a chief petty officer from Iowa , trim at forty-five , pale with religious good health , does n't need either one . He 's got his camera . " Took a six-month course in medical photography in ' 62 . I 'm a specialist in that now , a medical photographer , actually . " When someone mentions at midrats that there 's been a change in sailing orders , that they 'll be at sea an extra week , the chief says , " Yup , that 's the Navy for you . " The spade picks it up , gazes at him dreamy-eyed , smiling . " Man , how you talkin ' like that ? Twenty-eight years , man , you got twenty-eight years in the fuckin ' Navy . Man , you ca n't talk about nothin ' . " The chief took pictures of the eyeball coming out ( your eyeball , you did n't know it was going so soon as they , you did n't mark its passage . How many hours before you knew , coining to partial consciousness on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for they took away scraps of your mind , dug them out with their steel rods , gouged into the pink-red pools filling among the ganglia that used to think you were yourself 1 . He 's got this fantastic new lens , really something , quite the latest , miracle piece of equipment , you shoot five inches away from the eye , the brain , the testicle ( another doctor , the last to work , except for the dental surgeon doing a mandible jub , snipped open your scrotum sack  --  dark , near-purple in there , the darkest hue in the rich montage you were last night  --  he snicked out the shrapnel , probed deep with a finger , like the leg-and-gut men scooping with their hands , popped them out one at a time , the balls ? " Balls , that 's a medical term , " one of the corpsmen smiled behind his mask  --  firm knobs , to look for holes . No holes , that you were spared , that which the grunt fears most of all " Damn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beer after a day in the bush , where half a dozen mines and booby traps were found and one man got it in the balls . " Not bein ' able to get some leg . I 'll tell you the way I went through that field today  --  just like this . One hand holding my weapon , the other right here . " He clasped a hand over his nuts The doctor stuck the knobs hack in , just as the Southerner , the orthopedist beside him , complained that he 'd stolen his scrub man , jibed the scrub man : " Do n't give that to him . Give it t ' me . Ya was scrubbin ' fo ' me fuhst . " And the testicle doctor , who was . closer , grabbed the syringe from the scrub man , squirted the brown solution three feet through the air , raining it down all over your leg , the green cloth , the floor , then emptied it with a flourish in your scrotum . " Next case , " he grinned , behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testicles , and your penis , poor shriveled thing with the catheter tube sticking out of it all through those operations . You can still get some leg if you can just get a girl . It 's not likely you 'll get the female nurse who took your pulse and gave injections there in the pulse and recovery room while the fluids ran in and out the tubes . She knows that parts of your body are gone , remembered only by your sweetheart , fiancee , wife , and , more indelibly , by the film of our specialist , the medical photographer ) . He 's got all of you inside the camera box , got all the other broken bodies in there too , and when the battleship New Jersey sailed by on display th afternoon you were hit , he went on deck and go her in  --  different lens , same box  --  he 's got all a Vietnam that floats his way inside the box , Insta matic.Panatomic , special film ; there 's nothing tha escapes his box . HE CAPTAIN OF THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Jersey , both ships uncle way , pulling alongside at sea . " The New Jersey i going like hell , " he boomed over the loudspeake system , " hut we 're gaining on her , " and the crei roared in appreciation . Hundreds of men , a dozes nurses , at the rails with cameras , getting it all in side their boxes too . Afterwards , in his cabin , the captain turned roil the porthole , offered his hand . Mat was the Net Jersey , " he deadpanned , " in case you haven ' heard . " Of course I had , everyone had , the prid of the Navy , sailing the coast , firing her big gun at the mainland , north and south of the " Z , " eacl round 2,700 pounds , the size of an automobile going overhead with the noise of a freight train and when the short party calls for a round the : do n't call in coordinates , just a grid square , a kilo meter to a side  --  that 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jersey . The captain passed out cigarette lighters will the name of his ship . " Our ship , " he said , but h was still thinking of the New Jersey . " Our ship ha treated over 6,000 battle casualties since she cam over and , here 's an interesting point , almost exact the same number of disease eases . " Two commands aboard this ship , ship 's coin pang and hospital company , two captains ; but thi captain , the ship 's commander , has final say , hi word overrides the other 's . Yet his ship carries n. armaments , except a few small arms , carries no classified material , remains fully lit up at night even in hostile waters , has never suffered an enem. attack . It is a floating hospital , and all this captaii does is drive it around . " We fight the other war here , " he says I hot many other wars does that make , now ? ) , " the wa that nobody hears about . " The captain , who used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , still thinking about the New Jersey . " Helicop ter landings , " he perked up a little , " we 've had ove 9,000 helo landings aboard without a single mis hap . We just had a ceremony commemorating ou 9,000th accident-free landing , gave an award t. the pilot . " Only a couple of hundred died ; most of then who get this far are kept alive . " About the on ? ones we ca n't save are the ones with severe brai damage . And those are the only ones I personal think , sometimes , it 's just as well not to save . " H grimaced at the pain of having to say this . " But these are fine boys , " he said , gazing steely eyed toward the porthole and the New Jersey " these are fine boys . " And then he said , " I wis. some of these hippies and yippies whatever , h must have wondered , those are who are protestin all the time could be here just once to see one of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ casualties return to duty , their bodies still good enough for love and so for killing , both testicles and eyeballs still in place , and so they will still be malingerers , cowards , cop-outs if they do n't return to battle . But you  --  your body is broken enough now , destroyed , enough of it is not there so that they will ship the rest of it home and call it fine boy . T HE DOES N'T KNOW IT , but the hippies and yippies are on board already , grooving on the remnants of bodies , recalling them coolly . " Did ou see that guy in here last night ? " one asks as they change shifts . " What happened to hint ? " " Died , man . " " What 'd he die of ? " " What 'd he die of ? He was crushed . man , flattened out . " Grooving as the hippiest doctor almost grooved ( - filleted all the way down " I , but as he did not groove , as he did not say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he speaking to you sternly instead : " The more you fight it , John , the more it 's going to hurt . Try to relax , John . " leaving it to the corpsman to say , " Just let it come easy , John , let it come easy , " and to say in the lounge , " No face , man . Oh , man , no face . " But at least the doctor did not say either , as the captain said  --  for doctors have too much class for that , they 've seen this stuff too much , and they know how much they can do for a man , how much he 's good for , how long , they know which remarks to kill with their juice  --  he did not say , like the captain , still looking out the porthole , thinking of carrier-commander Fredric March in some half . remembered movie of the Korean war , " Where ( lc we get such men ? Where do they make men like these ? " And neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the two souls on the beach  --  the two medics at the 18th surgical hospital , the 18th surge carrying off the chopper the upper half of your buddy , one who did n't get to the ship , the whit ( man wrapped in a poncho , just half , the lower hal . blown away by an American 105-mm. dud shel buried and booby-trapped , most of the guts stil there , hanging out , gathered together in the poncho and a piece of one buttock and thigh hanging out just that much of his lower half still attached , jus the outer layer of skin , dragging on the , ground like a tail , and one detached meaty leg , no skin left carried in one medic 's hand , wrapped in a fatigta jacket  --  neither the doctor nor the captain said , no did the cameraman chief say , nor the buddy furthe behind him than you when it happened ( who said almost crying , but not , for very shock , " He was sue a swell guy too " ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , heavy whisper , turning away , going bad to work or to do another number , " Oh-h-h , wowman  --  wow .
