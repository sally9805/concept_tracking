txt The house call , a slowly dying tradition in American medical practice , is being resurrected and transformed into a lucrative service industry by a small group of medical entrepreneurs . For $20 to $25 , a growing number of house call agencies are dispatching physicians to patients ' homes , where they substitute for the family doctor . Most of the doctors who make the calls are low-paid hospital residents , eager for extra cash , but some are military doctors , retired physicians and young doctors who have not yet settled into practice . Critics of house call agencies express strong reservations about whether residents and retired physicians can give a patient the level of care his family doctor might provide . Residents are often worn out from their hospital rounds , critics say , while retired physicians are sometimes out of touch with recent medical ad-. vances . While most county medical soc:eties accept the new agencies as a practical way to fill a need , some have expressed reservations about the ethics involved . They question , for example , whether a family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changing roster of substitutes . A spokesman tor the Milwaukee County Medical Society said he was concerned about the prescribing of drugs over the phone to unfamiliar patients . Some patients express doubt about the degree of attention and commitment they get from ' a stranger who sees them for half an hour and probably never again . But the concerns providing the services say they are getting few complaints about the quality of care . " We have n't had any malpractice problems in the three years we 've been running the program , " said Dr. David A. Scheinman , the 29-year-old founder of Health Delivery Systems in Brooklyn . Long-Time Trend For years the trend has been away from house visits . Government statistics show that house calls declined from 45,7 million in 1957.58 to 27.3 million in 1966.67 despite a population rise of 26,745,000 during that period . Among the factors regarded AS responsible or the trend are the growth of hospital emergency rooms , the decline of the general practitioner and the belief by many doctors that house calls are useless in an emergency requiring specialized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , founder of Physicians on Call in Los Angeles , terms " the natural unwillingness of most doctors to get out of bed in the middle of the night , " have set the stage for the new private , profit-oriented organizations . Doctors have customarily relied on their associates to cover for them , but the system has its drawbacks . " You do n't like to lean on your buddies too hard , " said David Peterson , a young accountant who founded Rya ; cians Service in San Francisco . The first house call agency , Bridge Medical Associates , was started in New York by Dr. David T. Schwartz , an Air Force urologist , in 1966 . Bridge now operates in eight cities including Washington , Philadelphia and Atlanta . Dr. Schwartz , who hopes to set up the service in 50 to 55 cities throughout the country , is offering stock in the organization to doctors to raise money for expansion , I Most of the house call services work in this way : A physician registers with an agency , which usually charges him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on weekends and holidays , the service takes the subscribing doctor 's calls , sends a physician or gives phone consultation and collects a $15 to $25 fee . The subscribing physician gets nothing . Thus the agency collects from the patient and the subscribing physician . Collecting No Problem " We let the patient know that we expect payment . To be honest , collecting is very little problem , " said Miles N. Miller , a former industrial paper salesman who founded Day and Night Medical Service in San Francisco . The largest house call service in the country is Health Delivery Systems , which provides 24-hour service to 2,400 subscribing doctors and 150 participating physicians . It handled 50,000 calls last year . " We probably do more business than all the groups in the country combined , " Dr. Scheinman said . He came up with the Idea while making house calls for other doctors during his residency at Maimonides Hospital in Brooklyn . Health Delivery Systems serves all of New York City 's boroughs except Staten Island , and it has recently opened branches in Philadelphia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available tol provide protection to physi-I cians answering calls in slums . Fees $16 to $20 In New York , the fees range from $16 to $20 depending on the section of the city . " A moonlighting doctor can make anywhere from $150 to $180 on a 12-hour shift , " Dr. Scheinman said . Physicians on Call In Los Angeles , which is open from 6 P.M. to 6 A.M. weeknights ' ( and weekends , handles about half as many calls as Health Delivery Systems but uses more complex equipment . lI The service employs two seporate medical teams . In the office , a doctor and a paramedical aide screen calls and determine if the case can be handled through phone consultation at no cost to the patient . When a house call is neces sary , they radio-telephone a doctor and assistant who are cruising the city in a van containing minor emergency equipment and a double bed , Dr. London plans to furnish his two vans with oxygen and X-ray machines .

David Schwartz of Bridge Medical Associates dislikes the erm " house call agencies . " " Our guys are not committed to house calls , " Dr. Schwartz said . " They talk it over with the patient and then decide . The doctor could come to the house or meet the patient at the office or at the hospital . " Doctors employed by the house call services are required to have state licenses , Federal narcotics licenses and malpractice insurance , Dr. Jordan Scher , a psychia-I trist who founded Health Maintainence Systems , Inc. , in Chicago , sees house call physicians as an emerging subspecialty in the medical field . ' New Kind of Doctors ' He said it appeals to " a new kind of doctors who enjoy handling emergency calls and special problems and are n't interested in having a regular practice of familiar patients . " Many hospital residency programs , the prime source of manpower for house call agencies , frown on extra jobs for doctors , " If a resident moonlights all night he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's being paid for , " Dr. C. William Weisser , an eye surgeon at St. Francis General ospital in Pittsburgh , said recently . Dr. David Fearis , a partner in a Dallas service known as Doctors on Call , said that the new agencies were se benefit to hospital emergency rooms , which are often choked with persons who have nonserious ailments while emergency patients sit waiting . Incidents Reported Some patients , however , report unfortunate experiences . One Manhattan resident complained that the physician sent by a house call agency did not even bother to bring a doctor 's ; bag . In another case , a woman ' with a lingering virus infection ' was advised by an agency doctor that the illness was not serious and that she should go to work . The woman followed the doctor 's orders , but the virus later turned out to be a rare and serious type , and she was forced to slay home from work for three months . More frequent than complaints by patients about the quality of care they receive are objections to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a social nature ? either the doctor 's hair is too long or he is n't the right color , " David Scheinman said . He related the story of a woman who said during a phone conversation : " There 's somebody coming up to the door but he 's not a doctor . He 's black . " Dr. Scheinman said he replied : " Lady , you are going to have a problem . " Most patients , however , are grateful that a doctor will come to their home . A subscribing doctor of Physicians on Call in Los Angeles commented : " They know I need rest at night , too . But when they get sick , they panic . They want a doctor right away .
