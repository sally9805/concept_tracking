PEKING looms as a summit wreathed in mystery and uncertainty-and not only because no one can predict its outcome with any certainty . China is still emerging from the throes of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution , and muffled convulsions continue in the highest reaches of the regime . Who , in fact , rules China ? So far as is known , there is no vertical hierarchy , no line of succession . There is Chairman Mao , 78 , the Chinese revolution 's ever more remote deity . Then there is Premier Chou Enlai , 73 , the government 's chief-and almost only - public presence . <P> President Nixon thus pursues his negotiations with a two-man gerontocracy whose days must be numbered , actuarially if not necessarily in political terms . The passing of either man from the scene could mean an explosive end to China 's fragile surface stability-not to mention any und3r-standings that Nixon might bring back from the Communist capital . <P> Nixon will be greeted by Mao in Peking , and at the end of the trip may see him again in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mongolian winds that sweep down on the capital in February . But the man who will deal with the President on the issues is Chou , a brilliant , subtle , ruthless and endlessly flexible statesman who is at the apex of his extraordinary career . <P> At least in the world 's eyes , Chou was already the commanding figure in China when the Nixon trip was announced seven months ago . <P> Since then his role in the country 's affairs has grown even more decisive . The reason is the power struggle that came to a climax last September in a violent purge of hundreds of officials allied with Defense Minister Lin Piao , Mao 's designated successor as party chairman and the No. 2 man in the hierarchy . <P> Bonapartism . Lin 's fall and Chou 's move to the forefront is the latest turn in the long and often murky history of political combat in Peking . The regime reached its peak of strength and unity in the years just following the 1949 takeover . But in the mid-1950s , Mao began launching his doomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in persistent " indiscipline " in the party ranks , and the Great Leap Forward , which was an economic fiasco . Mao 's mistakes opened the way for challenges to his power by ambitious or disenchanted rivals . After the Great Leap stumbled in the late 1950s , Mao was rudely shouldered out of China 's presidency by his own protege , Liu Shao-chi , who championed work incentives and other " revisionist " economic innovations that were anathema to Mao . Isolated in the party chairmanship , Mao looked for a means of regaining power-and found the army . With Lin Piao , the army chief , he planned the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution , which would use the exuberance of the youthful , radical Red Guards to shake up the party-and shake out Liu and his group . <P> Mao was not entirely successful . <P> Liu fell , but control of the party still eluded Mao 's grasp . It passed instead to Lin Piao 's now highly politicized army , which eagerly stepped in to take charge of the country when Red Guard rampages began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
