txt To place an illegal or legal bet in the United.States is easy . Whether it 's horse racing , the numbers racket , or Choosing the Minnesota Vikings over the Kansas City Chiefs  --  a waiting bookie is as near as a telephone booth . So many Americans want to gamble  --  legally or illegally  --  that law-enforcement officials say it is the nation 's " biggest business . " Estimates of organized crime 's nationwide gross intake from all gambling operations vary from $7 billion to $50 billion a year . Legal betting at racetracks across the nation reached an all-time high in 1969 of more than $5 billion . At the same time officials believe that illegal betting on horse races , ? sporting events , and numbers reaches $20 billion a year . In New York , where the lottery , horse racing , and bingo are legalized , nearly $1.7 billion was wagered in 1969 . Horse racing alone accounted for $1.5 billion , highest in the nation . On a recent evening at Yonkers Raceway a crowd of 24,000 ? shivering in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of $3,220,686 in a single night . But the statistics about legal and illegal gambling ? as eye-opening as they are  --  only hint at a moral paradox facing the country . The pervasiveness of gambling in the United States raises difficult questions about the personal values of gambling Americans and their interest in the stability of their society . It also forces individual states to determine the extent to which gambling , in various forms , becomes the will of the people . ? ? ? First of all , illegal-gambling revenue is the bread and butter of organized crime . As far back as 1951 a congressional committee reported that organized crime 's profits from gambling " provide the . financial resources whereby ordinary criminals are converted into big-time racketeers , political bosses , pseudobusinessmen , and alleged philanthropists. " // *Gambling is bread and butter of crime ' // The losing $2 bet placed with a syndicate bookie is multiplied by millions in the hands of organized crime . The popular disclaimer that " a little bet now and then wo n't hurt anything " is a fallacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diversification of organized crime , and often evolves into murder . Conclusion reached In 1966 the National Broadcasting Corn , : . pany televised a 31/2-hour special program on the extent of organized crime in the - United States . It concluded : " Organized crime exists in the United States for two basic reasons . ' First , it performs services that many peo  --  ple want . . . illegal services that they can- not or do not want to do for themselves . Second , organized crime exists because of a moral climate that allows it to exist .. .  --  and to flourish . " It has been historically proven that the ? " service " provided by gambling  --  whether by organized crime or the Las Vegas roulette , wheel  --  pander to the lure that " something for nothing " is possible . Gambling suspends time , creates a sense of excitement , provides " instant action , " and appears to release the gambler from the social hierarchy and his responsibilty in it . In gambling it is acceptable to do ? anything by impulse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defies logic . When gambling is legalized , the appeal does not change : It is. simply exploited by the state . Argument advanced Those who favor increased legalized forms of gambling insist that under legalization organized crime can no longer compete for dollars and thus loses the vast revenues involved . They assert that . the state then becomes the beneficiary of new revenue for whatever desirable ends it wishes . In New York the argument has been attractive because of the state 's need to find additional revenues to meet the cost of expanding public services . But under the careful eye of history the argument has little substance . Nor , as evidence is indicating , is there much widespread interest in the lessons of gambling history . Bingo , the lottery , and horse racing now are legal . in New York . And there is a continuing interest in the establishment of " off-track betting centers " by the state . Yet historian John S. Ezell has written : " If history teaches anything , a study of over 1,300 legal lotteries ? . . proves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in if their total impact on society is reckoned ; and that 160 years ' experience indicates clearly that the most careful supervision can not eradicate the inevitable abuses in a system particularly susceptible to fraud . " Increase suspected Despite private and organizational efforts to inform the public of the dangers of gambling to persons and governments , there are clear indications that legal and illegal forms of gambling are increasing in their attractiveness . Voters in the State of New Jersey recently approved a state-run lottery by a 10-to-1 margin. , At the same time federal and state authorities recently made a surprise move in New Jersey to break up an illegal-gambling syndicate by indicting 55 men and women . One state legislator said : " The paradox is obvious . New Jersey wants to make it difficult to gamble with organized crime , but not difficult to gamble . " Surveys indicate that people 's attitudes toward gambling are quite ? permissive . A Gallup Poll of several years ago revealed that 45 percent of the adult population in the United States gambled occasionally . In a survey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was learned that " at least one New Yorker in every two participates in some form of gambling , " but the number who gamble regularly is small . Legalization hit Virgil W. Peterson , former director of the Chicago Crime Commission , asserts that any legalized form of gambling encourages more gambling , legal and illegal . " Any state that embraces legalized gambling departs from its proper function of encouraging thrift and productive enterprise among its citizens when it spurs them to take part in its new form of revenue raising . " Completely aside from the " moral " issues involved in gambling , the Tax Institute of America has stated : " The lottery is only one manifestation of the pervasive current search for Santa Claus in financing public services . . . . " So the great ? game of dodging the financial burden becomes increasingly complicated , as painless panaceas are feverishly sought . Yet no matter how many ingenious schemes we devise , sooner or later we learn with each of them that there is no Santa Claus , and there is no panacea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequently turn out to be the most painful . " Next : Compulsive gamblers tell of the " art of the second chance . " Legalized gambling New Hampshire was the first state to legalize lottery since the Louisiana lottery closed in 1894 . New York State soon followed suit , and New Jersey voters last fall approved a lottery measure .
