THE TALK . OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment OUR Financial Editor , just back from a whirlwind tour of the world 's money marts ( including a memorable two-day coming-out party for the beguiling young escudo in Punta Arenas ) , dropped off this report on the devaluation of the dollar and the ensuing world currency turmoil before entering the hospital with a near-terminal case of jet fatigue : Devaluation of the dollar has been followed by a predictable total failure of courage on the part of the American newspaper reader . " But do n't understand devaluation ! " whimpered Mr. and Mrs. Average Investor on the morning after Treasury Secretary George P. Shultz 's epochal ( and on the whole not unlucid ) announcement , thus driving the American dander still lower in world esteem while reconfirming our country 's ancient and enervating affection for laissez-faire ( " no spick " ) economics . Even in the worldly cafis of downtown Zurich , one saw Wall Street currency specialists , their Minoxes and joy buzzers laid aside , scratching their pates in puzzlement as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Once again , then , it is time to take our readers through a Q &; A primer of world money . Q : What is devaluation ? A : Plainly and simply , it 's a markdown , which enables Uncle Sam to get rid of some unwanted or out-nf-style goods in his " store " ? in this case , dollars . For example , the bargain ninety-cent dollar sold out by midafternoon of the first day in Brussels , Paris , and Hong Kong last week , thus making room for our new line of spring dollars , which will be previewed at Bill Blass 's opening before the end of the month . In Amsterdam , we did especially well with a Wildfire Lincoln 's Birthday Penny Sale  --  two dollars for $1.01 . Q : But how can you " sell " dollars ? A : Dollars can be bought and sold just like anything else . The simplest way to learn all about this is to ask Dadda for some old dollar bills and then set up a stand out on the front lawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You and the other kids on the block can take turns at being Secretary Shultz , Arthur Burns , and Valery Giscard d'Estaing , and you will notice that by changing the value of Mr. Dollar as the day goes along you will make lots of new friends . If you end up with more dollars ( or kroner , or marks , or forints ) than you had in the morning , please call the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company collect and tell them all about it ; they milli be waiting for your call . Q : Why does a country devalue ? A : Our recent devaluation was brought about mostly by the fact that foreign banks do not yet understand the importance of electric toasters and clock radios in monetary affairs . Without such essential banking lures , a great number of foreigners habitually " hold on to " their dollars , sometimes folding them into origami swans or musingly holding them up to the light anti wondering what " annuit coeptis " means ; then they yawn and tuck their greenbacks safely away inside an opera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stroll down to the corner for a fine , and another dollar day is gone forever . This makes the whole game of foreign exchange a big bore , like an afternoon of Monopoly during which one of the younger players slips all the cash under his cushion . Q : What about gold ? A : From 1934 until 1972 , Uncle Sap cheerfully bought and sold gold to foreigners and total strangers for the price of thirty-five dollars an ounce  --  a steal . With the onset of improved dentistry , however , the bottom suddenly dropped out of the gold-inlay market , and the United States has been forced to back its dollars with porcelain . Thus the position of the John Birch Society on fluoridation has been utterly vindicated . Q : What is " floating " currency ? A : The best place to sue and understand floating currency is on one of the well-known bridges over the Seine , in Paris . Here , on any warm morning in June , July , or August , one may observe tourists leaning over the parapet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ et down its smokestack before passing under the bridge . " Toot ! " goes the boat , down goes the stack , forward leans the tourist , and  --  hans ! ? there goes his wallet : floating currency . Actually , as a result of the recent devaluation , the yen and the bra have been permitted to float . The zloty is also trying to float , but its feet keep sinking . The guilder is poised anxiously at the end of the diving board , while the rial and the drachma will not he allowed in the pool until an hour after their lunch . Q : What about foreign trade ? A : Devaluation is intended to make foreign goods more expensive while sustaining the value of homemade products . From now on , a Mercedes , a Nikon , or a bottle of ChAteau Cos d'Estournel ' 62 will cost an arm and a leg , while a Vega , an Instamatic , or a pint of Thunderbird are expected to deepen steadily in charisma . As usual , Japan remains the key figure in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are anxiously pondering the meaning of the haiku written yesterday evening b1 the Em-peror : Young yen , orchid boat , Ripples currency moon-pondLeap upstream , Sir Carp ! Q : How important is this devaluation , anyway ? A : Good question . You see , on the occasion of the last American devaluation , at the Smithsonian meeting of 1971 , President Nixon hailed the agreement as " the most significant monetary achievement in the history of the world . " ( The entire party then repaired to the exhibitions and examined the John Bull steam engine and the stuffed body of Genera Sheridan 's horsy , Winchester . ) White House insiders hint that the President is wrestling with the proper wording with which to hail the Shultz pronouncement , Anything less than " tlil- most significant monetar ) achievement in the history of the solar system since at least 1971 " is expected to have a chilling effect on world trade , the price of gold , and the stability of the new dollar . Long Birthday JOHN CAGE is sixty . John Cage. , fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concert of his music performed by the Ensemble , at Alice Tully Hall , was merely the latest installment of what appears to have become a worldwide birthday party , largo sothinito and motto con amorr . Although a few scattered hot is in the packed Alice Toll ) auditorium gave notice that his music still manages to irritate and outrage some people , the concert was one of the most affectionate tributes we have ever attended ; at the close , when Dennis Russell Davies , the Ensemble 's young conductor , called Cage up to take a how , and Cage , richly bearded , clothed impeccably in denim , looking as wise and benign as a Chinese sage , applauded the young musicians and then turned to applaud the audience , which was FEIMARY 2 4 , 1 9 7 .3 standing up ro applaud him , there was no question that sixty was the age to be . A few days before this event , we called on Cage at his home , a basement apartment on Bank Street , and asked him about some of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " I turned sixty only last September , but I was considered to be sixty during all of last ye , - .1r . The first occasion was in West Berlin in January , 1972 . An art gallery there , the Kleher , ran I do n't know how many concerts of my music ; there must have been fifteen . I spent a gond part of last year touring in Europe with David Tudor , the composer , and there was a rash of special performances of my work -- -in Bremen , London , Bonn , Basel , The Hague , and Pamplona . David and I did another program in Berlin in June , and then we went back there in July for a large and very beautiful performance of ' Harpsichord . ' " Cage explained that " Harpsichord " ( whose formal title is " HPSCflD " composed in collaboration with Lei:an:II Hiller , is a work scored for from one to seven harpsichords and from one to fifty-two tape machines , in which selections from the music of leading European and American composers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a process of " fragmentation " according to calculations derived from the " I Ching . " " In Berlin , we performed it in the-lohhy of the Berlin Philharmonic. , " he said . " It was an ideal space , with man ) different levels on which we could mount our tape machines  --  we had fifty-two tape glachines and five harpsichords . And then inside the concert hall we had a perfectly conventional program of the same music u n f ragm nted , bring played by soloists . You cnulrl be in the lobby for a while , and then go into the c ( uicert hall and be right heck in the nineteenth Cell-tun . It was a very pleasant situation . " In addition to doing his own concert work , Cage serves on the music staff of the Me me Cunningham Dance Company , and diirTHE NEW YORKER ing the first week of September he and Tudor joined the Cunningham troupe in Shiraz , Iran ( which Cage calls Persia ) , to take part in the international arts festival there . " On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company was performing ' Canfield , ' " Cage said , " and Merce had arranged that at one point the dancers would form a circle around me , where I was sitting , at one side of the stage , doing the music , and sing ' Happy Birthday . ' From Shiraz we went on to perform in Venice , where I was invited to take part in a panel discussion of our work . One of the students asked why we had performed in a country like Persia , which has such terrible politics . I said , ou have to remember what country we come from . ' It was a very successful tour , I think , and there were many celebrations as a result of my turning sixty , and , naturally , I will he sixty all of 1973 . " The program for the Alice Tully Hal/ concert began with a very early twelve-tone piece called " Music for Wind Instruments " and ended with the first American performance of " Cheap Imitation , " completed only last year , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cage told us how it came about . " In the late forties , Merce Cunningham made a dance called ' Idyllic Song , ' to the first movement of Erik Satie 's Socrate , ' which I adapted for two pianos , " he said . " I liked the dance and the music so much that for the next twenty years I tried to persuade him to do the choreography for the two other movements , and I would do the two-piano arrangement . It was n't until the summer of 1969 that Merce finally said he would . I was composer-in-residence at the University of California at Davis then , and busy with other things , but in Illinois 1 had met a good young composer named Arthur Maddox , who agreed to continue the two-piano arrangement under my supervision . We finished it , and I wrote to Eschig , in Paris , Satie 's publisher , for permission to use the material , and Eschig refused . We pulled every string we could think of , but they would n't he budged . I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even want to see the arrangement , which was perfectly faithful in every way and very beautiful . Anyway , this brings us to December , 1969 , and Merce was to open in January at the Brooklyn Academy of Music , doing the new and as yet untitled dance . I told him not to worry  --  I would make a piece that kept the phraseology and the rhythm in de- ? tail but changed everything else . I said I would call it ' Cheap Imitation , ' and Merce said in that case he would call his dance ' Second Hand , ' and that 's what we did . I tried to imitate Satie in every way I could , even in the tide . You know , rather late in his life Satie was commissioned by a publisher to do three pieces , and he wrote them and gave them the title ' Three Flabby Preludes for a Dog . ' The publisher refused to publish them with that title . So Sane made one change  --  he called them ' Three Genuine Flabby Preludes for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' being in a sense the reverse of genuine , ' I felt my title was in the same world . " Cage is not doing much composing at the moment , but a new volume of his prose writings , called " M , " is to come nut in April ; the title was derived by consulting the good old " I Ching , " and to Cage it connotes music , mushrooms , and a dozen other good things . Another Cageian retrospective concert will take place at Columbia University on March 7th , and later that month Cage will be on hand ( and in the pit ) when the Cunningham company makes four appearances at the Brooklyn Academy of Music . In the meantime , he is busy organizing all his original manuscripts , musical and otherwise , so that he can give them away to various universities , and pondering both deeply and whimsically , as is his ? wont , on how to improve the world . " I must say I 've begun to feel skeptical about that , and even unnaturally pessimistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told this to Jasper Johns , he roared with joy and said , ' At last ! ' It 's true that the musical scene is very lively , and that 's excellent , but I ca n't help thinking that the great freedom of the arts that exists in the United States today simply proves that our government does n't take art seriously . If it did , it would clamp down on us immediate-. lye . " Cage burst out laughing . " The trouble is , " he said , " I 'm completely untrained as a pessimist . " Auras THE Second Western Hemisphere Conference on Acupuncture , Kirlian Photography , and the Human Aura was a cheerful and pleasant all-day affair at Town Hall last week . First things first . Kirlian photography was developed by the Russian husband-andwife research team of Semyon D. Kirlian and Valentina Kh . Kirlian . " The Kirlian process , " according to the recently published " Galaxies of Life , " edited by Stanley Krippner and Daniel Rubin , " employs a high-voltage alternating-current energy field between two condenser-like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ techniques had been employed by previous researchers since the early 19C0s . " The high-voltage alternating current takes a photograph of a leaf or a human fingertip , or whatever . The photographs thus taken are both beautiful and highly unusual . The leaves and the fingertips show bright streams of energy pouring from their surfaces . One speaker told us how to make Kirlian photographs in our bathroom at home : Use a red light , as in a darkroom . Put some unexposed film on the edge of the basin . Then put a Lincoln penny on the film . Then work up a good static-electricity charge on a nearby rug and touch the penny , so that a spark jumps . What you have when you develop this film is a much simplified Kirlian photograph . The moderator of the morning session was Mrs. Judith R. Skutch , whose husband , Bob Sktitch , a stockbroker , has done some psychic healing , and whose seventeen-year-old son , Jonathan Cohen , has been working with the Kirlian process . Mrs. Skutch is president of the Foundation for Parasensory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street . Mrs. Skutch wore a turquoise pants suit , and at about a quarter to ten she asked everyone to take his seat in a hurry , please , as they had a good and exciting and very full program that would leave everyone enlightened and enriched by midnight . We were sitting on the left , sort of in die hack , between a woman who was knitting and a young man who had a small pocket calculator he played with when he got bored . Very lightweight , this calculator , and only sixty dollars , he said , and it could add , subtract , multiply , and divide , and had digital numbers , and it was called Rapidman 800 . He showed us how if you divided by zero this forced the calculator to shut itself off . We heard five speakers in the morning and five speakers in the afternoon , and we left before the conference got around to acupuncture . First , there were some Kirlian photographs of the fingertips of laying-on-ofhands healers and their patients before and after treatment . Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's fingertip  --  these streams were referred to as coronas brightened after treatment . If this happened , the healer 's fingertip coronas diminished . Occasionally , the healer 's coronas brightened after treatment , inviting speculation that he was off his form and was draining energy from his patient . Dr. kVilliarn Tiller , a physicist at Stanford , called for more scientific controls on the Kirlian-photography experiments . He also reminded his audience that the senses and the brain act to select information . " The senses do not present reality , " he said . " They present information about reality . The brain acts to impose its kind of sense on this information . In a famous M.I.T. experiment , a man was required to wear glasses for two weeks that made the world look upside down . Suddenly , at the end of that time , his brain ' corrected ' the information it was receiving , did a flip , and he started seeing the world right side up again even though he was still wearing the glasses . " Stanley Krippner , who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in Brooklyn , then described the proceedings of the Bioenergy Conference in Moscow last year . He told us about a Russian psychiatrist who treated schizophrenia by forcing his patients to fast for a month . This doctor , Yuri Nikolacy , began his work twenty-eight years ago . He has treated eight thousand patients , two-thirds of whom , he has reported , made a full recovery . Stanley Krippner also showed a movie of a Russian woman who could move a cigar tube around on the top of a Plexiglas cube without touching anything . " You know , " the young man on our right whispered to us , " here are these new facts . You have to either change your viewpoint to include them or use them to bolster your current point of view . For some people , this evidence feeds their fantasies of a spiritual reality , and they get excited about it . Other people take it in their stride , and go on from there . That reminds me of a story I just read in a book , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you later . " After lunch , we had a new moderator , Lucille Kahn , who was very cute . When she was introduced , she could n't be seen over the lectern , so she turned to the audience and said , " This is how I levitate myself , " and a stage-hand brought her a box . Captain Ed-gar D. Mitchell , the former astronaut and the sixth American earthling to walk on the surface of the moon , told Os we should all be studying conscious-ness  --  only we should he calling it by a Greek word , " noetics . " There was a long speech by a scholar who used the word " reinstantinialized " twice . There was an interesting speech by a woman named Frances Farrelly , who said she was a water witch . Dr. John C. Pier-rakos , M.D. , an important figure in bioenergetic analysis  --  a very violent therapy that includes screaming , rant-ing , and raving  --  talked about the re-search he has done on the human aura . He spoke with his eyes closed most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons were mostly blue . A dirty-yellow aura indicated illness . Dr. Pierrakos , who was wearing yellow-tinted spectacles , also said that wherever a person had an area of muscular congestion and tension  --  and most people in our culture have tightening up in the shoulders and the small of the back  --  the congestion interrupted the aura . The young man 's chair on our right had been empty during the afternoon session . Now he returned . " I found that story , " he whispered . And , in a whisper , he read us the following story : " Hasan came upon Rabia one day when she was sitting among a number of contemplators , and said : ' I have the capacity of walking on water . Come , let us both go onto that water yonder , and sitting upon it carry out a spiritual discussion . ' " Rabia said : If you wish to separate yourself from this august company , why do you not come with me , so that we may fly into the air , and sit there talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do that , for the power which you mention is not one which I possess . ' " Rabia said : ' Your power of remaining still in the water is one which is possessed by fish . My capacity , of flying in the air , can be done by a fly . These abilities are no part of real truth  --  they may become the foundation of self-esteem and competitiveness , not spirituality . ' " Major Motion Picture AYOUNG friend of ours who is critical of his invitations and rarely agrees to attend anything came to see us the other day . " I have wonderful news , " he said . " At last , I have an invitation I can accept . Frank Yablans , president of Paramount Pictures , has asked me to attend a conference at which he will announce tVe acquisition of a Major Motion Picture . I 'm very pleased . It would be more interesting , of course , if Mr. Yablans were to announce the acquisition of a Minor Motion Picture , but it does n't pay to be too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Motion Picture involved is the film version of ' Jonathan Livingston Seagull ' and that there will be seagulls at the conference . I do n't know if you 've read ' Jonathan Livingston Seagull , ' but it is a remarkably successful book about a Seagull with Aspirations who goes to Heaven and then discovers that Heaven is just a different way of looking at things . I may have got it a little wrong , but it 's something like " At what hour tomorrow do you wish to resume your humdrum existence : ' " ? ? that , and any way all you rrally have to know about the book is that instead of being dedicated ' To Mother ' or ' To J. G. with love and wonder " Jonathan Livingston Seagull ' is dedicated To the real Jonathan Seagull who lives within us all . ' But still , if Mr. Yablans of Paramount has gone to all the trouble to hring seagulls to the conference , I think I ought to go , and I think you ought to come along . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held on the twenty-ninth floor of the Gulf &; Western Building , near Columbus Circle , in a screening room decorated in various shades of forthright red . At the front of the room , Mr. Yablans sat at a table with Mr. Hall Bartlett , who is the producer-director of " Jonathan Livingston Seagull . " " I do n't see any seagulls , " our friend said . We ca n't say that we saw any , either . We did notice that Mr. Yablans , who is a man of medium height with a fringe of dark hair , and Mr. Bartlett , who is a heavy man with lots of gray hair , had different styles . Mr. Yablans seemed to he retreating from the waves of effusive feeling that surrounded Mr. Bartlett . Mr. Yablans began the conference . Mr. Yablans kept to the facts . He said that the book " Jonathan Livingston Seagull " is unprecedented in publishing history . He said that more than two million copies have been sold in hard cover , and that in the first three weeks of paperback @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Yablans said that the publisher expects that record millions of copies will he sold in paper . Mr. Yablans said that the book has been translated into fourteen languages . " Successful honks are always translated into fourteen languages , " our friend said . " Never thirteen . Never fifteen . " Mr. Bartlett 's speech was less factually rigorous . He said he did n't feel that Jonathan belonged to horn or to Paramount or to the author . He said he thought that everyone who liked the hook was a co-author . Then he said that although he had met Fsank YaHans 001 ) three times , he knew Mr. Yablans very well . " Frank is a man who knows how tough it is out there  --  how to survive but Jonathan is going to get : timid of him . Frank is going to look inward -- beyond money . " Mr. Yablans looked a little quizzical , and lit a cigarette , cupping his lighter in his hands as though he were fighting a wind . Mr. Bartlett kept on talking , and said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to make " Jonathan Livingston Seagull . " " The girl I 'm going to marry brought me the hook , " he said . " If she had brought it one day later , it would have
