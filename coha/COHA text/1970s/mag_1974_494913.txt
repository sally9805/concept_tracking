other energy development areas ? specifically , for ex ? ample , strip mining of coal , coal gasification , certain types of oil shale development and any other type of resource development with environmental impact . " The memo , in an apparently unsuccessful attempt to raise " $25,000 to $30,000 " ( with the assurance of " no official identification " of contributors ) " to launch a modest media campaign " against Amendment 10 , claimed " that ballot box legislation on technical , com ? plex matters such as this actually constitutes a threat to representative government " and represents " a misuse or an abuse of the initiative process . " Amendment 10 may one day be tested in the courts , since the federal government has hitherto successfully argued that the AEC preempts state jurisdiction on questions of nuclear energy . Although the amendment neither prohibits ( it merely requires prior voter ap ? proval ) future nuclear detonations nor affects nuclear power plants , it does express electoral concern that the AEC might radioactively ravage the state . Also its stipulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? of all damages resulting from further nuclear blasting provides an additional deterrent to haphaz ? - ard energy development . PRES hopes that Amendment 10 will inspire continued citizen involvement in energy planning and serve as a model for other states . Although American Jews can hardly be considered a monolithic community , they are united in their dedi ? cation to the survival of Israel . Thus they are currently concerned by the possibility that they may be held re ? sponsible for the impact on the US economy of another Arab oil embargo arising out of renewed fighting in the Middle East . Such an eventuality , they fear , could revive the kind of anti-Semitism that was familiar in parts of America until a generation ago . The fear is real , but how does it square with reality ? Every study shows that suspicion of Jews , while appreciable during the Depression and through World War II , was never as profound in the US as it still is in Europe , and that it has declined massively within re ? cent decades . To a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Israel as a state has contributed to this evolution . Yet many American Jews can not shake off atavistic feelings of insecurity , though most would admit that the US is probably among the least anti-Semitic societies in modern history . Stephen Isaacs , whose book Jews and American Politics appeared not long ago , reports that the majority of prominent Jews he interviewed expressed a sense of inevitable doom , despite the success they had achieved person ? ally . Rabbi Arthur Herzberg , the president of the American Jewish Congress , told me the other day that he is confident enough to crack a Yiddish joke at a White House dinner , but , he added , " I still keep my finger up to see which way the wind is blowing . " Mark Talisman , administrative assistant to Rep. Charles Vanik of Ohio and one of the most effective operatives on Capitol Hill , hedges his basic optimism with the doubt that " we do n't know what will happen in a crunch . " And Bertram Gold , executive vice president of the American Jewish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the caution that " any ? thinking Jew is always apprehensive . " The apprehensiveness has lately been heightened by assorted symptoms of anti-Semitism in high places . Addressing a news conference last April , for example , Attorney General William Saxbe put forth the crude thesis that intellectuals were distrusted during the pe ? riod of the Joe McCarthy witch-hunts because " the ? n ? ? Jewish intellectual . . . was in those days very enam ? ored of the Communist Party , " and the transcripts of President Nixon 's private White House conversations feature similar prejudiced outbursts , among them a warning to H. R. Haldeman to avoid " left-wing " Jews who like the arts . Then came the remarkable perform ? ance of Gen. George S. Brown , chairman of the joint DECEMBER 14 , 1974 AA chiefs of staff , who told a Duke University Law School forum in October that in the event of a new war Amer .. icans would not only be " inconvenienced and uncom ? fortable , but suffer " unless they " get tough-minded * enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As if that was n't enough , Brown went on to sug- gest that the loyalty of American Jews is ambivalent , since , as he put it , their purported ownership of US banks and newspapers reinforces Israel 's sway over Congress . Reprimanded by President Ford , who tritely termed the general 's remarks " ill-advised and poorly , handled , " Brown later issued a confused apology . He was reportedly appalled both by the public outcry * against his statement and by the lunatic hate mail that surfaced in his favor . While some Jewish leaders de ? manded resignation , others preferred that he remain in service , on the theory that he will now have to bend I. over backward to show his sympathy for Israel . .1. y sources in the Pentagon claim that Brown 's out ? burst was less a display of anti-Semitism than a reflec ? tion of a measure of uneasiness in some quarters of the Defense Department with US policy toward the Mid . - dle East . According to these sources the Pentagon is almost totally preoccupied at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and this has produced divergent attitudes . Many senior officers strongly support Israel as a bulwark against Moscow 's penetration of the area . In addition they value the ability of the Israelis not only to test new American aims in action , but to pro ? vide the US with captured Soviet weapons of incalcu ? lable value to ordnance experts . Brown , who organized the airlift of US supplies to Israel during the Yom Kip ? pur war last year , undoubtedly shares this professional respect . But , like many of his colleagues , he may be worried that the US commitment to Israel has exacer- bated tensions with the conservative Arab states , and , at the same time , weakened the American alliance with Western Europe . And as his comments made clear , he mirrors the Pentagon 's annoyance with the fact that shipments of US military equipment to Israel have created shortages in American units . * Even so , as many observers have pointed out , Brown 's offhand attribution of these difficulties to al ? leged Jewish control of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the sort of mythology that should have died with Goebbels . Of the 1748 daily newspapers in the US in 1972 , only 3.1 percent were owned by Jews , and the Newhouse chain , which ac ? counts for half their circulation , avoids the appoint ? ment of Jewish editors and publishers . As for the Jewish presence in the banking system , surveys reveal no Jews in top management positions in the nation 's 25 largest banks outside New York City and only 30 4k among the 844 major executives in the eight biggest banks in Manhattan . If anything US banks may be coming under increasing Arab influence as they seek to serve as conduits for Middle East oil money . Early 13 this year , for instance , the Chase Manhattan Bank con ? cluded a deal to manage $200 million in Saudi Arabian funds , and several other American banking firms are opening branches throughout the Middle East . In contrast to his fantasies about the US media and banks , Brown 's charge that the so-called " Jewish lob ? by " wields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a truth that must be qualified . Among the principal Jewish lobbyists in Washington are Hy ? man Bookbinder of the American Jewish Committee , and Isaiah Kenen and Kenneth Wollack of the Ameri ? can Israel Public Affairs Committee , a registered agency of the Israeli government . They are extremely effective , as evidenced by their record on such issues as Sen. Henry Jackson 's amendment to force the Soviet Union to permit Jewish emigration and the $2.2 billion in military grants and credits to Israel , passed last December in the face of congressional cuts in foreign aid . But they are no more competent and considerably less affluent than the oil company lobbies that espouse the Arab cause and can rely on the sympathy of Arab ? ists in the State Department . The Jewish lobbyists owe their success to deeper strains within the country . The six million Jews in the US not only vote more heavily than any other ethnic segment of our popula ? tion , but their political activity is highly motivated and relentless . They are easily mobilized , and though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of huge donations to candidates , their cohesion is expected to enhance their importance as collectors of many small contributions . This explains , in part at least , congressional receptivity to efforts by the Jewish lobbies to promote support for Israel , and , according to a survey by one of these lobbies , that support will be stronger when the 94th Congress convenes in Jan ? uary . The survey , derived from questionnaires sent out to the candidates in last month 's elections , esti ? mates that some 250 members of the House and about 70 senators can be counted on to underwrite Israel . The defeat in the Arkansas primary last spring of Sen. William Fulbright , who took a cool view of Israel , was welcomed by Jewish activists . But there is more in all this than pure politics . For one thing Congress is responsive to national opinion , and the polls make it plain that Americans overwhelm ? ingly tilt toward the Israelis against the Arabs , even if sacrifices are required to back up that preference . A Harris survey published @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Americans favored contin ? ued aid to Israel despite the threat of prolonged gaso ? line shortages resulting from the Arab oil embargo . A recent Gallup poll indicates that only one percent of Americans blame Israel for the energy crisis , and a Yankelovich study collated last month found that 74 percent of the country considered the survival of a Jewish state to be " important " to the US . The same study disclosed that most Americans would hold ei ? ther the Arab states or the Soviet Union responsible for future trouble in the Middle East . Consonant with the prevailing lack of enthusiasm for foreign aid , how ? ever , the idea of US military and economic assistance to Israel is widely opposed . It is worth recalling that only 36 percent of Americans believed in late 1944 that a Jewish state should be created in what was then Palestine . Several reasons prompt Americans to lean toward the Israelis : the recollection of the Nazi holocaust ; es ? teem for the courage of Israelis and their insistence upon defending themselves without US troops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East . The Israelis have also benefited from a revulsion in the US against the image of Arabs greedily amassing co ? lossal fortunes through oil blackmail . An Arab con ? sortium has retained the public relations firm of Hill and ' Knowlton in an effort to polish up that image , but the effort will be uphill work all the way . The favorable US attitude toward Israel stems largely from the rise in the status of American Jews , and , conversely , US re ? spect for Israel has elevated the position of American Jews . This phenomenon , among others , bears on the decline of anti-Semitism in America . Seen over a span of years , the evolution of American Jews has been remarkable . In 1944 , for example , they were far out in front of all other groups regarded as a " menace " to America ; by 1962 that view had disap ? peared . Just after World War II three out of four Ameri ? cans said that they were unmoved by Hitler 's geno ? cide ; by 1961 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but considered it to be a justifi ? able device to remind the world of the Nazi horrors . These and other changes came about as American Jews , in step with the rest of US society , underwent a vast transformation . As Rabbi Herzberg sees it , the US has offered Jews a unique climate in which to flourish because , lacking a medieval past , anti-Semitism was unable to build on tradition . America 's economic growth made its contribution , since it removed a prime cause of friction . In addition , Herzberg sug ? gests , Jews have always been safer in multinational frameworks like ancient Rome , the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the US , which have had to accommodate to diversity . The premium on diversity has further de ? veloped as Americans , fearful of losing their identities in the homogenized US culture , have gone back to as ? serting their ethnic singularities . In short American Jews have acted no differently than Americans of Irish , Italian , Polish and other origins in rejecting the melt ? ing pot . Within this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of different and often divergent attitudes on a range of subjects . And be ? yond their cohesion on the single issue of Israel 's right to exist , they are fragmented in their opinions of the path that the Israeli government ought to take to guar ? antee its existence . They include those who criticize Israeli intractability in refusing to pursue more flexi ? ble policies toward the Arabs in general and the Pales ? tinians in particular , and , at the other extreme , there are American Jews who refuse to utter a word of re ? proach against Israel on the grounds that it would somehow be construed as betrayal . My own view is that it would be healthier if Jews in the US , both for their own sake and in their relationships with other Americans , dropped the pretense that open discussion of Israel 's internal decisions is somehow sacrosanct and spoke their minds forthrightly . Israel is , after all , a foreign country to American Jews , and free debate in the US about its activities should at least equal the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not perceive Israel in quite the same way that other Americans regard the lands of their forebears . In the first place it is not the " old country " but a new state that probably would have collapsed long ago had it not been financed by Ameri ? can Jews . Moreover it is a state populated by survivors ? to whom American Jews , who escaped by virtue of geography , feel indebted . And it differs from other states to the degree that it is daily confronted by the threat of extinction . For such reasons as these , Ameri- ' , ? can Jews feel a special kinship toward Israel , and it is that feeling that may complicate their role as Ameri ? cans . Despite all the data proving that anti-Semitism is moribund , they can not help imagining situations in which , as Gen. Brown implied , their loyalty to the US would be brought into question . It is hard to conceive of that eventuality objectively , since most Americans agree with the stated policy of the US government to defend Israel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not rational and Jewish nerves are exposed . Another Middle East crisis is not the only situation that could spark a recrudescence of anti-Semitism . A deepening recession that produced armies of unem ? ployed would trigger the search for scapegoats . A downward spiral that sapped Jews of their economic strength would , by depriving them of influence in their communities , make them targets for reprisals . Pointing to these possibilities , pessimists recall the prestige of the Berlin and Vienna Jews and the tragedy ? that engulfed them , and they scoff at the notion that " it ca n't happen here . " While he does not doubt that the polls accurately reflect " the expressed attitudes of the moment , " Thomas O'Dea , a Columbia University sociologist , has questioned whether " the psycholog ? ical depth and historical longevity " of anti-Semitism can be dealt with in responses to surveys . Many Jewish leaders remain persuaded that the danger is remote . One of them , warning against exag ? gerating the likelihood of anti-Semitism in the US , tells the tale that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woods when he learned that all camels were going to be castrated . " You 're not a camel , " his friend said , to which the Jew replied : " I know that and you know that , but do they ? "
