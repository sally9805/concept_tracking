txt Copenhagen The nine foreign ministers of the European Economic Community assembled here in sparkling Copenhagen have an enormously complicated task ahead of them : to map out Western Europe 's relations with the United States before they have successfully defined what they mean by Europe . It is not an abstract argument . President Nixon has held back his decision on whether or not to visit Europe this fall , depending on the answers the foreign ministers come up with . In the long run , the definitions the ministers evolve could set the pattern for transatlantic relations for years to come . After the heat wave that has assailed much of Western Europe during the past several weeks , the brisk breezes and insouciant charm of this water-girt northern capital could reanimate the European vision that seemed to promise such great things at the start of the year , when Britain , Denmark , and Ireland joined the European Community . Today many Britons are asking what Common Market membership has brought them so far except higher prices for food and nearly everything else .

U.S. ties // A French politician has suggested that West Germany may be turning its back on Western Europe because of its preoccupation with ostpolitik . And then ? Watergate Across the Atlantic , there is Watergate . European chancelleries are still assessing the effect this protracted affair is having on President Nixon 's ability to conduct foreign affairs . As the London weekly Economist said two weeks ago , " When the President of the United States loses his grip , half the world finds itself in pieces on the floor .

Should the Europeans go along with the American desire ? first voiced by Secretary of State-tobe Henry Kissinger back in April ? to take a new look at transAtlantic ties and to broaden them so as to include Japan as well ? Should they concentrate , first of all , on defining Europe , its personality , its place in the world ? French resist strongly One important European view , represented most persistently and most ably by the French , is that when Europe still has its unity to achiibve , it can not afford to start tinkering with definitions of relations with non-Europeans , whether with the United States or with Japan . Furthermore , the French say , Europe is on the verge of ? or has already begun ? important negotiations in many fields : world trade talks in Tokyo ; monetary - talks in Nairobi ; the European Security Conference including East and West Europe as well as the United States and Canada ( the second phase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Soviet Union , also in Geneva , in October . TransAtlantic relations will be defined concretely in the course of these negotiations . What is the need ? the French ask ? for a vague , general declaration of principles at this time ? The American counter-argument , which is to a degree supported by the British and the West German drafts , is that it is precisely because these important negotiations are going on or about to take place that a general declaration of principles is required . Dollar loss noted The French remain skeptical . The fundamentals of the transAtlantic alliance have not changed over the years , they say . But the economic picture has , the dollar is no longer almighty . Paris still fears that Washington will try to take advantage of continuing European dependence on the American defense . shield to squeeze European concessions in the trade and monetary field .
