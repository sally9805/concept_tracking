Like the oil industry as a whole , the multibillion-dollar business of building offshore drilling platforms and pipelines is a highly profitable , as well as risky venture in which many dwarfs live in the shadow of a handful of titans . Of them all , the two largest are J. Ray McDermott &; Co. of New Orleans ( 1977 sales : $1.3 billion ) and Houston 's Brown &; Root Inc. ( $1 billion ) . <P> For the past two years , a federal grand jury in New Orleans has been investigating just how it could be that the two firms , which together control some 75% of the world market for offshore drill rigs , maintain their lopsided shares even though the business has been going through an unprecedented boom . Last week the grand jury handed down an eleven-count indictment charging the companies and seven of their high executives with conspiring to rig bids for contracts . Their aim , said the indictment , was to guarantee that one or the other of the companies would always be the lowest bidder on a job-whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as J. Ray McDermott lately has done for Shell Oil in the Gulf of Mexico , constructing and installing a $275 million rig that from the ocean floor stands 15 ft. taller than the Empire State Building . <P> The companies in effect admitted guilt by pleading " no contest " in a New Orleans federal district court . They were promptly socked with fines of $1 million each , the largest penalties ever levied in a federal price-fixing case . The indicted executives include Charles Graves , 62 , the soft-spoken chairman of McDermott ; Robert Richie , 47 , McDermott 's president ; three top vice presidents of Brown &; Root Inc. and two vice presidents of McDermott . Each faces charges of antitrust violations as well as additional allegations of mail fraud . If convicted on the antitrust indictments , the men will be subject to maximum three-year prison terms and $100,000 fines each . <P> Just two weeks after the grand jury began its investigation in January 1977 , Foster Parker , a prominent Houstonian who was then Brown &; Root 's president , committed suicide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly $1 million for a whole range of offenses , including making illegal campaign contributions and offering kickback bribes to a former top executive at Tenneco . <P> Will the indictments break the two companies ' hold on the industry ? Houston oilmen have their doubts . Says the president of a competing firm : " This wo n't change a thing . They 're too powerful , too well entrenched . "
