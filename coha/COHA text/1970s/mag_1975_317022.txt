When Franklin Roosevelt 's New Deal pushed through the nation 's labor legislation in the ' 30s , one group of workers remained conspicuously unprotected : the farm workers . Last week California 's Governor Edmund Brown Jr . won initial legislative approval for a bill that would finally give farm workers in one of the nation 's richest agricultural states the protective legal umbrella they have long sought . <P> The difficulties go back to 1962 , when Cesar Chavez , the union leader , started organizing farm workers ; his grape boycott compelled many California growers to bargain with his United Farm Workers . Only a few years after Chavez had won that victory , however , the Teamsters Union moved into the California fields , using greater resources and occasionally bullyboy harassment . Often without the approval of their employees , many of the growers who had signed with Chavez jumped over to the Teamsters ; that union seemed to offer them less trouble . At the same time , many workers also turned to the Teamsters , who ran a more efficient organization . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than at administering union services or parceling out jobs equitably . Membership in Chavez 's union plunged from 55,000 in 1972 to as low as 6,000 today ; by contrast , the Teamsters now have 55,000 members . Bloody organizational fights between the two unions have become almost routine , and Chavez has maintained boycotts of lettuce not picked by his workers , and of table grapes and all wines produced by the E. &; J. Gallo Winery . Gallo 's workers in 1973 switched from the Chavez union to the Teamsters , but only in an unsupervised vote . <P> In a 60-hour session early this month with representatives of Chavez and 17 growers-the Teamsters would not join in-the Governor produced a compromise bill . Under the measure , the farm workers , beginning next January , will be able to vote with secret ballots in state-supervised elections for any union they want . Secondary boycotts-picketing liquor stores that carry Gallo wines , for example-will be restricted , limiting Chavez 's use of one of his most effective weapons . <P> Chavez supports the bill because he says that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gallo backs the bill and so do the growers . The Teamsters are opposed to it . The bill 's chances in the California legislature are good nonetheless ; a state senate committee has approved it by a 5-to-l margin . There will probably not be an immediate end to the labor conflicts even if the bill is passed , but it is at least a move toward peace-and the legally protected free choice of unions for farm workers .
