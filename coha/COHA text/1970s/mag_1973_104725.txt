After John Colter left the Lewis and Clark expedition he headed north into Crow country , looking for good trapping areas . It is said he began his journey in November of 1807 , and in the wintry months that followed discovered the vast and mysterious wilderness of Yellowstone . The author and a friend are probably the first white men to make a similar trip ( they chose to hike north to south ) in midwinter . For 17 days in subzero temperatures they snowshoed through blizzards , clambered across mountains and elbowed through herds of elk in the valleys . They took with them only sleeping bags and packs , no tents . // An hour before dawn I awake and lie staring blankly at the pulse of neon on the frosted windowpane . Neon ? Suddenly I realize the notion is absurd . In long underwear and socks , still half asleep , I walk outside to see what 's going on . The night is calm and clean , the air brittle with the cold . I scramble up a roof-high snowdrift beside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire dance on the rim of space  --  tracers of gold , red , green , blue . The sky show sheds enough light to illuminate the mountaintops and fill the valley . It is bright enough to read the battered Coca-Cola thermometer that hangs near the door : 27 ? below zero . // This is Cooke City , Mont. , a mountain village on the edge of Yellowstone Park . The town is largely empty now , most everyone having left with September 's first snow . About 30 people remain to face the winter , a violent time that lasts for nine months . A ski school operates here in July , and from November till June , Highway 212 , the only road through the valley , ends in a snowdrift at the end of town . A road through Yellowstone Park is plowed daily to provide access to civilization  --  it is 60 miles to the nearest settlement , 110 miles to the nearest barber or bank and 200 miles to the nearest pizza hut . One reason for the long winter is the elevation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over 10,000 feet ; they squeeze the townsite on all sides , so tightly you have to look up to see the horizons . // As soon as it is light we will begin our journey into northwestern Wyoming where we will cross the Absaroka Mountains and follow the major river drainages across Yellowstone Park to the Continental Divide . We plan to pick up the Snake River on the western slope and follow it through Grand Teton National Park to the base of the mountains and the community of Jackson Hole . Our route covers a linear distance of 175 miles at an average elevation of 8,000 feet . // Bindings tightened , Mark Stearns and I shoulder our 70-pound packs with grunts , pull on face masks , lower amber-lensed snow goggles and move down the deserted street into the red dawn . Someone pulls back a curtain and waves  --  our only audience . // At the end of town we mount a snowdrift , enter the timber and trudge toward the high country . Mark takes the lead , and I shuffle behind in the narrow trench @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than those I remember from years of watching Sergeant Preston ; buried to his knees in fluff , his advance more closely resembles that of a high-stepping drum major than an Eskimo . Apparently a pair of 10-inch-by-56-inch webs which might easily support the weight of a man on heavy , moisture-laden snow do not support him on the talcum powder of the northern Rockies , especially when the wearer is strapped to 70 pounds of hardware . On the other hand , I 'm not struggling at all , since Stearns has packed the snow on which I 'm walking . // Inevitably Mark realizes the inequity of our positions , and we agree to rest and change every quarter of a mile . An hour later we are switching every 50 paces and cheating whenever we can get away with it . Our inner clothing is drenched with sweat , and with the temperature dropping about one degree an hour we are obliged during those periods , ludicrously referred to as rests , to flap about like wing-shot mallards to keep our underwear from freezing . // Progressive dehydration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dry air seems to suck body fluids from every pore , and the moisture is not immediately replaceable because our canteens have frozen . The ashlike snow offers no solution , and after braising my tongue on a frigid handful I decide to place the canteen against my bare stomach to thaw . // Despite the discomforts I 'd rather be here than , say , in Pittsburgh . A few hours out of town we can not see , hear or smell civilization . In a meadow below we watch a crippled moose , its head cocked , belching steam , its antlers clawing the air . It crashes through a spray of snow into a juniper stand . A half a dozen coyotes follow . Stillness . // By late afternoon we are climbing through the granite peaks of the Absaroka Mountains , approaching  --  if my $2 compass is accurate  --  a 10,400-foot rubble heap that bears the dubious name Republic Pass . Already a thousand feet above timberline , we are navigating through snow-filled couloirs and avalanche striations and across ice caps that cling with exquisite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on snowshoes . The labor is exhausting , painful , but it is absolutely necessary that we breach the pass before dark and move down into the timber on the western slope . The alternative is a bivouac in the open on a storm-blasted mountaintop without the benefit of firewood . // After 10 grueling hours we are on the summit . We stand on the narrow ridge vomiting and slapping ourselves like Bowery drunks killing imaginary spiders . It is late . The sun swells and splits on the horizon . Shadows fill the valleys . We feel the need to move on and find shelter , and yet we linger , watching the mountains turn lavender and gold . // The view is unrestricted for 200 miles in every direction , more of the earth than I have ever seen from one spot . Mountains shred every horizon : titan peaks , five separate ranges at least , perhaps as many as nine . They unfold ridge behind ridge into the night . // Many people consider this the pantheon of American wilderness , the last and the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the farthest boundaries of Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Park , and even beyond into the wide buffer of Primitive Areas , Wilderness Areas and National Forests . We can not see a single artificial light , column of smoke , building or road . The village of Cooke has vanished . At this moment and for weeks to come , Stearns and I will be virtually alone in an island of wilderness as large as the state of New Jersey . // We move off slowly toward the timber line at the headwaters of Cache Creek . With no small measure of anxiety the two of us gradually begin to comprehend the enormity of our undertaking . We have entered an environment in which man has no exalted post . Our lives have no priority here . // After banging about for an hour on the darkened mountainside we stop and prepare a camp in a stand of lodgepole pine inside the eastern boundary of Yellowstone Park . We dig a shallow sleeping pit , standing on one web and using the other as a shovel , then pack the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plastic between the bordering trees . Stooped uncomfortably beneath this canopy we stretch out insulated pads and unroll our sleeping bags . // Shivering violently now that our movements are more confined , we brush away loose snow , pull off our boots and squirm into our bags  --  ignoring completely several logical reasons for removing damp clothing . It is almost 30 ? below , and I have decided that my skin is as close to the air as it is going to get . Despite the parlor talk about the " dry cold " of this region , when the thermometer bottoms out an exposed finger will swell and split like a boiled frankfurter. // With one arm out of my bag , I set up a stove and begin melting snow from the wall of the cubicle to prepare supper , a task that proves tedious . With complete lack of foresight we have packed a bottled butane stove without realizing that the stove will freeze in this sort of weather . Even with impurities added to the fuel cannisters , the stove 's efficiency , especially this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Working by candlelight it takes almost two hours to melt enough snow for drinking water and to cook a simple dehydrated stew . The stew looks , smells and tastes like soggy tissue , but it has been a long day , and I lack the energy and the inclination to prepare anything more . // I sleep dully and awake at dawn wrapped in a translucent shroud . Five inches of snow have fallen during the night , and our plastic roof has sagged to floor level under the load , covering packs and bags like a massive quilt . Kicking the cover away we half bury ourselves in fluff. // The damp clothes I have slept in have dried , but the moisture has passed through them into my sleeping bag , which now bristles with spears of ice . Our leather boots , damp with sweat and exposed to the night air , have frozen stiff , as well as our face masks and the woolen inserts to my mittens . Enthusiasm , frozen like everything else , is discarded . // Breakfast is elaborate and awful . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one package of instant breakfast , four ounces of powdered whole milk , two tablespoons of Tang , a few raisins and dried apples , half a handful of wheat germ , brown sugar , honey and a cup of boiling water . The concoction tastes every bit as terrible as it sounds , but for nutritional reasons ( it is much too cold to stop for lunch ) and to conserve water , we agree to make it our standard morning meal . // It is a gloomy , gray and altogether nasty morning . A milky froth has settled over the mountains , and the sun has dissolved without a trace . Snow falls , but there is no wind , and the huge flakes drop straight and silent through the pines . We have to get moving , obviously , but I for one am somewhat reluctant to pull on a pair of frozen boots and venture out into a raw and moody landscape that more closely resembles the surface of Jupiter than anyplace else on earth . Self-discipline at this point is a superhuman virtue , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // For several hours we tramp through magnificent stands of fir and spruce , gratefully aware that descending a mountain on snowshoes is easier than ascending one . Following ice-clogged Cache Creek , we arrive eventually at its junction with the Lamar River . We hear the river long before we see it . The sound comes rolling through the snow like the gentle rustling of curtains . It is the first sound in 24 hours not related to our movement , and we savor it . The river appears black in the dull light , and water vapor rises like smoke off the surface , marking its erratic course until it meshes in the distance with the gathering mist . // We move north along the waterway , cross a convenient ice bridge near Chalcedony Creek and move downstream into the broad Lamar Valley . In the shelter of the valley we begin encountering game : elk , moose , buffalo , mule deer , a few bighorn sheep and the inevitable coyotes , ravens and magpies . Of these , elk are by far the most numerous . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like goblins on the moor . In areas of heavy grazing the valley is crowded with them , thousands of animals weaving through the falling snow in a tangle of antlers . The herds extend as far as we can see . Our route becomes a maze with animate blockades . Close contact is unavoidable and , although many animals are wary , there is no panic . We pass close enough to some to brush away the cape of snow that covers their backs ; our jackets are soon damp from touching the rivulets that trickle down their sides . // Occasionally buffalo mingle with the elk , but these are usually solitary animals grazing apart from the larger herds along the Yellowstone River . They forage with heavy lumbering movements , plowing through the drifts with pendulum swings of their massive heads . Most of them are feeble and stalked at close quarters by coyotes that give us scant berth on their perpetual hunt . Winter is a fat time for predators . Our travel is frequently punctuated with gory scenes of coyotes and magpies tearing strips of flesh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the end of the day in a tumble of boulders at the base of Specimen Ridge , hoping the natural shelter will keep us from getting stepped on and also provide some relief from the rising wind . The elk are still with us . I can hear them browsing in the dark ; panning with my flashlight I fill the night with dozens of glowing green globes . A few coyotes investigate our presence or , more precisely , investigate the beans we 're cooking . We toss them strips of beef jerky , and they reward us with a community sing . The valley soon reverberates with a high , lonesome yodel. // It is still snowing , but the dense cloud cover has warmed the air to a stable 6 ? below . Feeling adventurous , I strip to long underwear and socks before crawling into my bag . As an afterthought I pull in my boots , pants , a fuel cartridge for the stove and a canteen of water . Sleeping with these items is the only way to keep them from freezing , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half an hour trying to jam my feet into frozen boots . // We awake the next morning as cramped and stiff as before , but this time the stiffness does not go away , it gets worse . Our muscles are as hard as wood and will not flex without pain . During the night my knees have swollen so drastically that pulling on my pants requires stubborn effort , and after we move out I begin to feel the grating of bone in my knees and hips . Our movement slows . Walking till dark on snow packed hard by foraging animals we cover only seven miles . High adventure , I 'm beginning to realize , is not synonymous with fun . // We had planned to ford the Yellowstone River pioneer fashion at the ancient crossing on the old Bannock Indian trail , but the trail is lost somewhere under eight feet of snow , and we prudently consider the alternatives before attempting to negotiate an unknown stretch of water . We cross instead the bridge near Tower Falls and head south along the spectacular river gorge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blacktail Deer Plateau . Looming somberly in our path are the Washburn Mountains , a few tight peaks on the lip of Yellowstone 's Grand Canyon . Although it involves another serious climb , we must cross this range to reach the Central Plateau and Yellowstone Lake . // A north wind rises late in the day , pushing clouds that skid along the ground , filling every creek bottom and ravine and pouring through the passes around the mountains like rivers of smoke . Since our first night in the park we have been dogged by snow squalls , low cloud ceilings and poor visibility , but now I have the feeling that something serious is about to happen . There is a certain tension in the wind . A storm center is approaching . Already our path is blocked by swirling drifts , and the new snow drives through the trees with a terrible fury . // Harassed by stinging flakes that dodge through the darkness like swarms of hornets , we prepare camp near the base of Mount Washburn , four miles from Dunraven Pass . The wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night , and the wild gyrations of the treetops paint silver trails on the black cloud bottoms . Too tired after our climb to cook dinner , we settle for jerky and a frozen brick of cheese and use the last of our water to make lemonade . I sleep restlessly , my body so cramped and twisted that I am unable to stretch full length . // Sometime before dawn the wind accelerates to gale force , and we are jerked awake by the powerful sound of trees smashing together . Moments later our plastic roof alters its casual undulation and begins snapping violently with hideous shotgun reports . It tears loose finally with a wrench that snaps its nylon anchors and sails off through the trees like a giant bat . Unobstructed , smoking tendrils of snow pour into our sleeping pit , burying our gear and us . In less time than it takes to struggle out of our bags the crude shelter is nothing more than a low place in an ever-expanding drift . We load our packs , fumbling in the dark for stray equipment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we head into the storm . // The air is so laden with wind-whipped snow that the dawn , when it arrives , is hardly more than a glow and does nothing to improve visibility . All sense of the horizontal has vanished ; my vision is so restricted I can not see my feet . // The wind screams beyond the pass , pushing the snow into grotesque drifts that rise head high around us ; as the hillside gets steeper our route becomes an obstacle course . Drifts meet us head on like moving walls  --  we breast them like surf . This is exhausting , especially in our weakened , dehydrated state ; pain occupies every fragment of our consciousness . My brain is filled with music , forgotten songs , the top 10 of 1963 , a little Wagner , drum rolls , insane lyrics ; all pain , pulsing pain , rhythmic pain , like some masochistic dream  --  torment to your favorite tune . // We break from the timber onto the barren hillside and the wind slams us with such vehemence that balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heels . There are no handholds ; no up , no down . Our packs wrestle us like living opponents . The wind fills my mouth and throat with snow and blisters my lips . My lungs ache from sucking the air . An icy crust is forming on my cheeks and nose despite the protection of a face mask , and my feet have begun to burn with the sharp intensity of an open wound  --  frostbite , no doubt about that , but there is nothing I can do about it until we camp . // Exhaustion soothes me like a balm . It erases in equal proportion pain and will . The urge to stop is overpowering . The roar of the wind becomes a soporific melody . Arctic explorers may well have lain down in the snow to die . After fighting this blizzard I actually look forward to falling because it allows me a single moment of rest while buried in a drift . Once down I fight the urge to roll back and sleep , but Stearns is wise to me . If I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tip of his snowshoe. // When pain and fatigue have all but blotted out the storm , an avalanche supplies a shot of adrenaline . We have just crossed a steep couloir near the end of the pass when a cornice the size of a house tears loose from the mountaintop and roars through the narrow channel into the valley below . Above the wind we can hear trees snapping like match-sticks , then the rumble dies and there is only the storm . // Stearns and I are suddenly fueled by a mechanical energy that supports us far beyond the rational limits of endurance . Good thing , too . Not only am I bone weary , but the pain in my feet is rapidly easing to a dead , hollow feeling . Not a good sign ; I wo n't be able to walk much farther . // We breach the pass in the middle of the night , having traveled slightly less than four miles in the last 15 hours . In the lee of a hillside on the least slide-prone slope we can find in the dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But before we can sleep , unpleasant rituals must be performed . Mark removes his boots and socks and plants his feet in my armpits . In turn I place my feet in his . My toes are chalk white and slick as glass , and my blackened toenails are held in place not by skin but by pools of frozen blood . After five minutes the first flashes of pain slice through the numbness , and moments later my toes feel as though they are filled with acid . Massages follow , until the circulation improves and the threat of gangrene is no longer imminent . My toenails are gone . They lift off as easily as pennies off a sidewalk . // We sleep as if drugged for the next 30 hours and still feel the need for rest , but the sagging roof of the snow cave encourages a hasty departure , and there is no point in procrastinating with 20 tons of snow suspended eight inches above our noses . Before we leave I cook up some macaroni and cheese  --  our first hot meal in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No meal ever tasted better . Life seems plausible once more . // Outside , the snow has stopped and the wind is down , but the sky still looks ominous . Will it start again ? I do n't know . I do n't want to know . In the South that blow would be called a hurricane , easily . What is the wind-chill factor with a 90-mph wind and an actual temperature of 10 ? below ? Seventy below , maybe ? Eighty ? I 'm not entirely certain that I could survive another blizzard ; I almost did n't make it through the last one . The circulation in my feet is very poor , and I am painfully reminded with every jarring step that my toenails are gone . I can feel the blood congealing in my socks . I can still walk , but not far or fast . Mark , to my utter amazement , has escaped serious frost injury , but he has somehow damaged both his hip joints , rather severely I think . His movements are accompanied by a sickening , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // It is snowing again as we approach Yellowstone Canyon , but there is no wind and the sky is soft and white . We walk through pine grottoes and across the plain , following as closely as possible the gravel roar of the Lower Falls , and emerge from the trees on the north rim of the chasm . At this point the plateau drops abruptly 1,500 feet into the foaming Yellowstone River . The colorful canyon walls are lined with massive spines of volcanic rock , and here and there a puff of steam and a dot of green against the snow will mark the location of a belching fumarole . At the head of the canyon a mile to the south the Yellowstone River plunges 309 feet into the snow-filled gorge . We can not see the base of the falls because a wall of ice , maybe 90 feet thick , rises out of the river to half the height of the cascade . Enormous icicles hang from the cliff beside the falls , and it is difficult to determine from our distant vantage point where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems stationary , frozen in space , with only the terrible thunder to suggest differently . // On a very narrow pinnacle of rock that extends farther than the others from the canyon rim , we dig a snow cave . We could , should , travel on and try to make up lost time , but there is something powerfully attractive about this place , something almost supernatural . When night comes we build a fire on the edge and watch enraptured as the glowing red embers curl off our tower on a quarter-mile free fall into the abyss . It is an odd , not entirely pleasant , sensation to stare down into space , more so here than anyplace I 've ever known . The Indians believed this exotic labyrinth was inhabited by animistic spirits , and I do n't doubt it . I feel drawn to the center of the earth , beckoned by sirens , taunted by waterfalls . We throw the last of our wood on the fire , and when it is burning brightly kick the flaming brands over the brink ... flashes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for one instant the sparkle of the river . An offering . // We follow the river above the falls where it winds through the hills to Hayden Valley . In the meadows that are open for a long way to the west the snow is packed hard by the wind , and the walking is easy if we stay on the crests of the drifts . The discomfort of our abundant injuries is serious , but not intolerable as long as our movements are simple and regular . Consequently , we are making an inspired effort to keep them simple and regular . // The valley that we enter is a wide , rolling plain open to the horizons except for a few scattered stands of pine . A large herd of buffalo , perhaps a hundred animals , grazes in a tight formation near the river . Another , smaller , herd is plowing four abreast over a hillock on the south shore of Alum Creek ; the lead bulls are buried to their throats in snow . We see one other mammal , an enormous otter , dragging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A moment later there is only a tiny scarlet splotch where both had been . // Waterfowl are the most numerous living things in the valley . We round a bend in the river and are blitzed by a quacking , flapping explosion of geese , ducks and swans , thousands of birds . They struggle frantically for altitude , make one wide swooping parabola and land once more on the same stretch of water they occupied before our intrusion . Birdcalls replace the wind as our companion noise ; I could follow the river blindfolded. // In the afternoon the wind rips holes in the clouds , admitting ribbons of yellow light that float across the valley floor , illuminating patches of frozen marsh . A bald eagle soars against the sky , then banks with a flash into a column of sunlight and out again . He is a rebel ; all of his kin migrated months ago , and his aerobatics do n't resemble any hunting maneuvers that I 've ever seen . It looks as if he 's flying for fun . // Billowing steam rises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the bitter air to form a dome of ice crystals that hovers mirage-like above the tallest trees . The pungent odor of hydrogen sulfide drifts through the air . As we move closer we wade through an eerie ground fog that floats in the forest , hiding the source of uncountable subterranean explosions . We camp on warm and barren ground near a lake of boiling mud , a thermal feature typical of the area . At our camp the temperature six inches off the ground is 35 ? . Fifty feet away the snow is five feet deep and the temperature is 5 ? below zero . // In this bubble of warmth formed by the boiling pools and fumaroles are swarms of flies and gnats and green plants growing in profusion . Algae stain the hot pools with vibrant colors , reds , blues and oranges , that contrast sharply with the snow , and ghostly frost-covered trees ring the mud volcanoes like pieces of sculpture . The earth rumbles , gasps . Tongues of sulfur explode into the air . This is a weird , unnatural place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you have the feeling that you are witnessing the formation of the earth . // It takes another full day to walk the seven miles to Yellowstone Lake . Warm chinooks blowing down the eastern slope of the Continental Divide have made the surface snow wet and sticky . It grips our webs tenaciously , forcing a painful , jerking stride . Our injured bodies perform with reluctance . // This huge mountain lake is not frozen , as we had hoped ; we could have shortened our route by 20 miles by crossing the ice . We have arrived a few weeks too soon , and are greeted by choppy gray surf . With Jackson still 90 miles away , we must begin exercising a degree of economy in preparing meals . We are almost a week behind our projected schedule , and have full rations for only three more days . // Wind coming off the lake forces us inland , and it is almost two days before we reach Geyser Basin at West Thumb . We camp on the lakeshore in the heart of the thermal activity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinking . This is forbidden land , according to park regulations , just as the mud volcano region had been , but the ground here is warm and we are cold . I am prepared to risk the wrath of the National Park Service . We are ushered to sleep by the bark of geysers and another more soothing melody , a distant lofty song far out on the lake , sad and compelling . I have never heard anything like it and have n't the slightest idea what it might be . // We wake to a different and hideous sound , a snowmobile . The road that passes through West Thumb to Old Faithful 20 miles to the west , although now plowed in the winter , is open to snow machines . Park records indicate that it is heavily used . Fine with me , there is nothing I want to see along that road , anyway . We move east to get away from the noise . // North of Heart Lake we cross the Continental Divide , jubilant with the knowledge that from this point it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an easier route ahead , we are certain after a week of serious doubt that we will not have to surrender our racked and weary bodies to the ranger at South Entrance of Yellowstone . Despite the storms , the frostbite and a weight loss of 20 pounds , we are now convinced that we can finish the journey as planned . A cause for celebration . We indulge ourselves with a few mouthfuls of slushy wine  --  even alcohol freezes . // To avoid fording the Snake River we move west around Mount Sheridan to the Lewis River Canyon . Here , where a bridge spans the gorge , we encounter a six-passenger snow coach that has plowed head on into a drift . The engine grinds , the tracks spin and the machine begins to sink into the snow . Stuck . They have a radio , they will just have to get someone to come pull them out . // Rather than rejoice at this unexpected confrontation , we are repelled . It is like finding hordes of strangers in your favorite fishing hole . For no good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belong here . I resent their presence . // We move to avoid the stranded vehicle , but are stopped dead when a female head pops from a porthole in the roof yelling , " Harry , Harry , Harry ! " A bald head begins to emerge , but in her excitement the lady begins slapping frantically , first on the roof and then on the bald head , which quickly withdraws . // " Oh , oh , oh , ah , ah , " the lady goes on , " you 've come to get us . They 've come to get us , Harry . Harry ! " The Nikon camera that dangles from her neck , without a lens cap , begins to bang with horrible percussion against the porthole . I can see the scratches from 10 feet away , and begin to hate that woman with a passion that can only be comprehended by a poor man who happens to fancy cameras . Stearns , fortunately , is able to handle the situation with a modicum of tact . // He apologizes . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn and leave ; the Nikon lady yelling , " Wait , wait , we 'll pay ! " Our mood is a foul one , familiar to bigots and other rabble . // The four-day trip down the western slope of the Divide through the Teton Mountains is sadly anticlimactic . After the incident in Lewis Canyon we never regain the sense of isolation that separated us for so long from the common lot of sightseers . Grand Teton National ' Park is simply too accessible and too crowded for my taste . The valley floor has been slashed by highways . Two ski resorts operate near Jackson , much of the park is open to snow machines and every lakeshore and aspen grove seems to be inhabited by a party of cross-country skiers . If local promoters have their way a new , bigger , noisier airport will be built across this valley to permit an even greater influx of people ; and after that , more hotels to house the travelers , more restaurants to feed them , more rental cars , more gas stations , more subdivisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Jenny Lake in the middle of a snow squall , and the mountains , although less than a mile away , are hidden by clouds . Strangely , I can feel their presence even without being able to see them . Skulking like animals we hide our camp on the lakeshore , hoping it will be missed by the patrolling rangers  --  neither of us could pay the fine for illegal camping . Over a frequently doused fire we prepare the last of our rations : a single envelope of oatmeal and half a pot of tea . We do not bother ' with a shelter , we are much too tired . We just unroll the sleeping bags in the snow and crawl in . Sleep these days is never far away . // Morning , our last day . The storm has passed , the sun rises . The Tetons loom with the cold austerity of an ancient ruin . We pack the gear slowly and tramp off toward the trail that leads from Moose Park to Teton Village . The pines thin in the river bottom and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plays on the snow through the barren branches . Near Phelps Lake we catch a last glimpse of the Grand Teton before it passes behind a shoulder of rock . From this crag the wind drives plumes of snow into purple space where they hang soft and distant like the sails of a phantom clipper . A fine ending , grand and glorious . // We reach the village after dark , guided in the final stretch by the multi-colored beacons which adorn a tiny spruce tree in front of the hostel . It is Christmas night .
