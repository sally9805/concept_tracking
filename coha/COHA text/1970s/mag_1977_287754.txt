They are classy , flashy and splashy . <P> They cater to singles , couples and triples , straights and gays and feys , blacks and whites , the well-shaped or the merely well-heeled-and just about anyone else who yearns to break out of 9-to-5 humdrum into a space-age world of mesmeric lighting , Neronian dcor and , of course , music , music , music .

The hustle and the bus stop , the rope and the roach have largely been replaced in the past year by either a languid free-form oscillation or neojitter-bug . There is even an occasional foxtrot , Lindy or waltz-to the 2001 version of the Blue Danube . However the patrons dance , the new discos are designed , says Boston Disco Manager Mark Hugo , to make " everyone feel like a star . " <P> The music almost everywhere is " disco sound " : heavy back beat , uptempo , often with Big Band effects . Favorite artists are Barry White , Gloria Gaynor , Donna Summer , the Silver Convention , Maynard Ferguson , Shalamar , Marvin Gaye , the Bee Gees , the Isley Brothers , Jerry Butler-as well as Sinatra , Como and Glenn Miller . They are cunningly selected by the all-important disco jockeys who keep a hawk 's eye on the floor and choreograph the dancers by changing the pace and style of the records and tapes .
