Hardly anybody noticed , but there was another presidential nominating convention last week . Arriving at Chicago 's Conrad Hilton Hotel , about 700 American conservatives , many from the South and West , gathered to choose a ticket to take on Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter in November . <P> The conservatives convened under the banner of the American Independent Party , a coalition of right-wing forces that claims roughly 1 million followers and has put forward national candidates since 1968 . In that year Alabama 's George Wallace led the A.I.P. to its greatest electoral success , garnering an impressive 9.9 million votes-nearly 14% of the total cast . But Wallace dropped out of the 1972 race after his near-fatal wounding in Laurel , Md. , and was not involved with the organization this year . Ronald Reagan , a leading horseman of the right , was reluctant to leave the Republican Party after his convention defeat to ride in the A.I.P. presidential saddle . <P> Nonetheless , followers of the two men made up the bulk of last week 's convention . The groups did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backers favored a more aggressive anti-Communist foreign policy , advocating a strong American reaction against incidents like the killing of two U.S. soldiers by North Koreans . Wallace " populists " tended to isolationism . According to A.I.P. National Chairman William K. Shearer , " There would n't be anybody there to get killed in the first place . " <P> Four Boxes . Still , the two movements found more than enough to agree upon . One keynote speaker suggested that America 's freedoms rest on four " boxes " : the soapbox , the jury box , the ballot box and , most important , the cartridge box . The platform opposed drugs , gun control , busing , welfare , ERA , Washington , the United Nations and Communism , and endorsed police enforcement , America First and the family . <P> Agreement broke down over the choice of a presidential slate . One faction was led by another former Governor of Georgia , fast-talking , flamboyant Lester Maddox , 60 , who charged that George Wallace had " joined the pointy-headed bureaucrats . " John R. Rarick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and antiSemitic , headed up another . An articulate former New York judge , Robert Morris , 61 , now president of the University of Piano in Texas , was the choice of the intellectuals , including William Rusher , publisher of National Review . Richard Viguerie , 42 , a direct-mail specialist and publisher of Conservative Digest , was picked as Morris ' running mate . <P> Maddox won on the first ballot-a victory that bitterly disappointed the intellectual faction . It also stirred talk among them to try to form yet another party , one divorced from Maddox and his segregationist image . <P> The A.I.P. trumpet will thus be an uncertain one this fall-and probably in 1980 as well . The party drew only 1.4% of the vote in 1972 with former California Republican Congressman John Schmitz , a John Bircher , as its presidential candidate . It hopes to be on at least 30 state ballots this year . With its rigid platform and small following , however , it is hard to imagine the A.I.P. growing very fast , or very large .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
