Chicago 's mayor derails the " city that works " <P> This would n't have happened if Mayor Daley were still alive . " So Chicagoans console themselves when things go wrong , and last week , it is true , the late Richard J. Daley would scarcely have recognized his beloved city . A transit workers ' strike stranded a million commuters and temporarily disrupted the city 's economy . A walkout by oil delivery truck drivers caused a gasoline shortage . For the first time , the city 's firemen voted to authorize a strike . And the school system , the nation 's third largest , was on the verge of bankruptcy and in danger of closing . The " city that works " had never been so close to a breakdown . <P> In his 22 years as mayor , Daley faced strikes aplenty ; yet he had a knack of finessing and postponing problems until , sooner or later , they went away . Combative Jane Byrne , however , makes the mistake of attacking labor unions and other groups rather than hunkering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Byrne 's biggest problem has been the transit strike . By taking a tough stand , she initially had public opinion on her side . The 11,000 transit workers are among the highest paid in the nation ; experienced bus drivers make $10.58 an hour . Only a week before the walkout , a settlement seemed in sight . The two Amalgamated Transit Union locals agreed to two cost of living increases a year with a 14% annual ceiling . But then talks abruptly broke off . <P> Part of the reason was that Mayor Byrne talked too much . She had threatened to bring in strikebreakers if the drivers walked out . She called in the parties to the dispute and announced a settlement before it was actually made . Says a former aide to Daley : " He never called people in . He waited until both sides asked him to act . Then he got to work . " Daley also had clout and trust . A handshake was sufficient to seal an agreement . Because she is new to the scene , Byrne 's handshake is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she got some trains rolling , and rode on one herself . A Chicago judge then came to her rescue by issuing a permanent injunction against the strike and ordering binding arbitration of the dispute . After four days in the yards , the buses and trains were in service , but the walkout left scars on both the city and the mayor . <P> Meanwhile , Byrne , the Chicago school board and state officials were scrambling to put together an emergency loan package to keep the schools from collapsing . Shut out of the bond market in November because of a poor rating , the educational system faces a shortfall of $459 million by the end of the fiscal year on Aug. 31 , 1980 . It needs $190 million just to keep going through January . <P> Again , Byrne 's pugnacious style seemed to make the problem worse . She got into a public fight with Illinois Governor James Thompson over whether the state or the city had the ultimate responsibility of financing the schools . Says Jerome Van Gorkom , who was appointed by Byrne to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation is not serious ; it is desperate . "
