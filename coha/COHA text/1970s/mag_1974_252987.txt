Until Maury Wills started stealing bases by the bushel for the 1962 Dodgers , everyone in baseball thought Ty Cobb 's modern record of 96 thefts in a single season was untouchable . Now anyone who assumes that Wills ' mark of 104 is beyond reach must count again . Last week , not quite halfway through the season , St. Louis Cardinal Leftfielder Lou Brock stole his 50th base , putting him 28 games ahead of Wills ' 1962 pace . As if that were not enough , Brock has collected those steals in only 56 attempts , for an astonishing success rate of 89% . <P> For Brock , whose daring has helped keep the Cards in first place in the National League 's Eastern Division , the assault on Wills ' record is only the latest feat in his 14 years of pilfering . He already ranks fifth ( after Cobb , Eddie Col lins , Max Carey and Honus Wagner ) in lifetime steals ( 685 ) , and holds the major league record for the most seasons ( ten ) with 50 or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who has the best throwing arm in baseball , admits , " There just is n't any way to stop Brock if he gets a decent lead . " <P> Crucial Fraction . That is quite a compliment for a man who moves on 35-year-old legs . At an age when Ty Cobb was able to steal only nine bases in a season and Wills had slowed down to 52 , Brock looks as streamlined as he did a decade ago . He stands 5 ft. 11 in. and weighs a trim 170 lbs . Stop watches have clocked his dash from first to second at 3.5 sec. , half a second better than the average baserunner . It is a crucial fraction . " It takes a pitcher an average of eight-tenths of a second to deliver the ball from a set position , " explains the analytical Brock . " Add to that the time it takes the catcher to handle the ball and make his throw , and you 've got a total of 3.5 seconds for the ball to reach second base . So the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <P> Besides sheer speed , Brock has a gift for anticipating pitchers ' moves . " Every pitcher has a body cadence and rhythm , " says Brock . " Once you 've learned to read it , you can tell whether he is about to make a pick-off throw , and you can know exactly when you can start toward second . " When on first , Brock silently counts a cadence that is synchronized to the pitcher 's delivery : <P> one-two-three for a hurler who pauses long in the set position or one-two-three for someone faster . On three , which should be the precise moment the pitcher has committed himself to throw home , Brock starts his dash . <P> Brock also takes some educated guesses before he runs . Because curve balls take a fraction of a second longer to reach the catcher than fast balls , Brock prefers to run when he thinks a curve is coming . He figures the odds by studying the habits of catchers and attempting to guess when they will call for breaking pitches . <P> Despite his remarkable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surpassing Wills ' single-season record . In 1962 Wills stole third 16 times . Brock , though he has a green light from his manager to run any tune , has stolen third only three times this year . " I 'm not very good at it because I have n't practiced it much , " he admits . " Unless you can be successful at least two out of three times , it 's gambling instead of base stealing .
