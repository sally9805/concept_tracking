Among olfactophobic Americans , few chemicals are more commonly used than hexachlorophene . An antibacterial agent that supposedly helps to prevent offensive odors by inhibiting the growth of the germs that contribute to them , hexachlorophene is a common ingredient of soaps , shampoos , and toothpastes as well as special preparations used to wash newborn babies . But is it safe ? Not for babies , according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration . Although there is no proof that hexachlorophene has harmed humans when used according to directions , the FDA sent a warning last week to 600,000 doctors and health officials , declaring that regular bathing with products containing 3% or more of the chemical may cause brain damage . <P> The safety of hexachlorophene has been in dispute for some time . The chemical has been blamed for brain seizures in young burn victims who have been washed with it , and for skin irritations in women who use feminine deodorant sprays . In addition , researchers reported earlier this year that rats fed on hexachlorophene suffered brain damage and paralysis . Others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that some babies who were washed regularly with it developed concentrations of the chemical . <P> Monkey Evidence . The most damaging evidence against hexachlorophene , however , came from Winthrop Laboratories , whose popular baby cleanser pHisoHex is 3% hexachlorophene . Winthrop recently tested the soap on baby monkeys , who were bathed with it daily for 90 days . All of the animals developed brain lesions . <P> Because there is no proof that hexachlorophene harms humans , the FDA has not banned products containing it , nor does the warning apply to preparations containing small amounts . At the least , the FDA alert , aimed primarily at commonly used baby cleansers , should decrease their use . To replace them , the American Academy of Pediatrics has proposed a substitute that will keep a baby just as clean as hexachlorophene : plain soap and water .
