Reconsiderations Progress and Poverty When Progress and Poverty was first published by Appleton in 1880 , it became a worldwide best-seller almost at once . Reviewers hailed it as one of the most remarkable books of the century . Newspapers ran portions of it as a serial . Cheap paperback editions were printed in both America and England . Foreign editions were published in Progress and Poverty by Henry George ( Originally published by Appleton , 1880 . Now available from Modern Library ; $2.95. ) more than a dozen languages . Within a few years more than two million copies of the book had been sold , and many more than that number of people were familiar with its ideas . Henry George 's popularity was such that , when the Labor Party drafted him in 1886 to run for mayor of New York City , he finished second in a three-way race , outpolling Theodore Roosevelt but losing to the Tammany candidate . When George died a decade later in the heat of another New York mayoralty campaign , more than a hundred thousand people passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the city streets was compared to Lincoln 's . Yet such are the vagaries of intellectual fame that Henry George today is little more than a footnote in the history and economics texts . When he is remembered at all it is as a single-taxer , a semi-crackpot with a magic cure-all for society 's ills . His name is magic only in the dozen or so Henry George schools that have sprung up to perpetuate George 's teachings . This is a great pity , for Progress and Poverty is a monumental work that deals only briefly with the single tax . No other economics book that I have read possesses the lucidity , grace or compassion of George 's classic . And while there are faults in George 's reasoning , and much of what he says has been blunted by the passage of time , what strikes the modern reader is how extremely pertinent this book remains . The fundamental question posed in Progress and Poverty is as the title implies : Why , in the midst of ever-growing plenty , does poverty persist and indeed flourish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do men die of starvation , and puny infants suckle dry breasts ? " This paradox , while worldwide , is nowhere more evident than in the United States , where " almshouses and prisons are as surely the marks of ' material progress ' as are costly dwellings , rich warehouses , and magnificent churches . " On the American frontier , George observed , there was neither great wealth nor grinding poverty ; all men worked hard and were rewarded with material blessings in approximately equal proportion . Yet as industry progressed and cities rose , so too did the disparity of income and opportunity . New York , the greatest city of all , swarmed with paupers , and San Francisco , where George was a printer and newspaperman , was not far behind . Far from alleviating human want , material progress was augmenting it . " It is as though an immense wedge were being forced , not underneath society , but through society . Those who are above the point of separation are elevated , but those who are below are crushed down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this phenomenon was , for George , the paramount task of political economy . Clearly , he reasoned , the cause must lie somewhere in the mechanics of the distribution of wealth . At about the same time that Karl Marx was placing the blame on the expropriation by capitalists of the surplus value of labor , George 's analysis was leading to a different conclusion . His basic argument can be briefly summarized . Wealth is produced by a combination of three factors : land , capital and labor , the returns on each being , respectively , rent , interest and wages . As the productive capacities of labor and capital payment for the use of bare land , as opposed to payment for the use of buildings ) therefore rises as fast as wages and interest . Indeed , rent rises so Fast that it swallows up all increases in the value of production , thus making landowners , rather than workers or capitalists , the sole ( and wholly undeserving ) beneficiaries of progress . " The great cause of the inequality in the distribution of wealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George concluded , and this led inexorably toward his famous remedy - the transformation , through a tax on rent , of individual land ownership into common land ownership . George 's economic reasoning was buttressed by an excursion into the realm of social ethics , much of which is strikingly resonant with what ecologists are saying today . The only private property that is legitimate , he contended , , is that which is the product of labor ; as a man belongs to himself , so his labor , when put in concrete form , belongs to him and no other . The gifts of nature , on the other hand , are given to all indiscriminately , and no man has a right to possess what is equally the birthright of his fellows . When , because of population growth or the advance of civilization , a particular piece of land or natural resource rises in market value , that rise is not the result of any one man 's exertions , and can not rightfully be appropriated by any one man . To tax that rise in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tax the fruit of a man 's labor , while sometimes necessary , is essentially unjust . George 's economic reasoning has flaws . While for example , some increase in the value of production is appropriated by the owners of land , all of it is not thusly stolen . Private land ownership is not the only cause of poverty amidst plenty , and taxation of land values , while reasonable and just , can not by itself bring abundance to all . And yet , despite these and other weaknesses in George 's arguments , and despite the flood of economic writing we have had in this century , I am convinced that American economic thought has , in a most important respect , regressed since Progress and Poverty . The great fascination of latter-day American economics has not been the laws of distribution of wealth ; it has been , to use the fancy term , macroeconomics : the national-scale problems of growth , inflation and unemployment , and how to use government policies to control them . The present mechanisms for distributing wealth within the total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , says the conventional economic wisdom , is to iron out the business cycle and increase GNP ; income distribution will then take care of itself , mainly through the trickle-down process . If , for any reason , some Americans do n't get themselves aboard the gravy train , they can be kept alive ( barely ) through welfare . The failure of modern economics to question the distributive system has been accompanied by a parallel brainwashing of the general public . In George 's day , millions knew the underlying cause of poverty was not Americans ' unwillingness to toil , but the fact that Robber Barons were squeezing every possible penny out of the hides of working men . Today the monopolists are subtler , the unions stronger , and Madison Avenue more ingenious . The Horatio Alger myth , with all its corollaries , is more firmly entrenched than ever . It 's not the system that creates economic inequality , says the myth , it 's personal inadequacies : lack of education , sloth , a defective family structure . Improve the individual and you eliminate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If one man work harder , or with superior skill or intelligence than ordinary , he will get ahead ; but if the average of industry , skill , or intelligence be brought to the higher point , the increased intensity of application will secure but the old rate of wages , and he who would get ahead must work harder still . ... The fallacy is similar to that which would be involved in the assertion that every one of a number of competitors might win a race . That any might is true ; that every one might is impossible . " When the War on Poverty arrived in the early 1960s and raised the same question posed by George in 1880 , it came up with all the wrong answers : give " them , " the poor , job training ; give others , the bureaucrats , jobs ; but do n't for a moment tamper with the tax laws or anything that might fundamentally alter the distributive system . Now , five years from the date proclaimed by Sargent Shriver as the millenium by which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people in America than before the War on Poverty began . The great wonder is not that American economists have failed to resolve the poverty-amidst-plenty enigma ( for it is a highly cure-resistant paradox ) but that they have so easily been diverted from the quest . I am certain that Henry George , were he alive today , would not be nearly so complacent . It outraged him in 1880 that " New York alone spends over seven million dollars a year " on official charity ; imagine his sense of injustice today ! Perhaps , in surveying our high-technology economy , he would perceive the insuficiency of his land value tax approach ; perhaps not . In any case he would assuredly be asking the right questions . American interest in Progress and Poverty ought to revive . Some vita/ questions might then be reinjected into the economic debate in this country - questions such as whether land , and even capital , are public resources , and thus ought not to be monopolized for the profit of a few ; whether income earned through labor ought to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( thanks to the capital gains and other loopholes , labor-earned income is currently taxed at an even higher rate than income gained through manipulation of capital and land ) ; and where , in the entire economic system , the diversions occur that prevent an equitable distribution of wealth . It has not been fashionable of late for economists to poke at the inner workings of our system , or to evince the passion and compassion Henry George did . That is another reason why Progress and Poverty deserves to be revived : it could help make American economics the essentially humane and radical discipline it ought to be . In his preface to Progress and Poverty , George wrote that what he tried to do was to econcile the laissez faire ideals of iberty and individualism with the ocialist goal of economic justices he put it , " to unite the truth pereived by the school of Smith and ticardo to the truth perceived by the chools of Proudhon and Lasalle. " siinety years later that remains an uninished task . American political ecotomy should get on with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
