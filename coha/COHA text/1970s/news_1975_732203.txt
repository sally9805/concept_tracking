txt THE FORMATION OF a new personnel department to replace the Chicago Civil Service Commission was approved Friday by the City Council . The council also approved another controversial measure to help finance the building of the Crosstown Expressway . The council approved the ordinance setting up the new personnel department by a vote of 44 to 3 after two hours of arguments that veteran City Hall observers said was the most heated in memory . The attack on the ordinance was mounted by Aldermen William Cousins Jr . 13th , Martin Oberman ( 43d3 , and Dick Simpson 44th , who submitted more than a dozen amendments that were struck down . The amendments would have sharply reduced the administration 's authority to exempt employes from civil service status , and would have banned discrimination not only on grounds of race , color , or sex but also on grounds of sexual orientation . THE NEW ordinance , which goes into effect Jan. 1 , provides for the civil service commission to be replaced by a new five-member personnel board , appointed by the mayor with council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It stipulates that temporary appointments , frequently the source of political patronage abuses , could Icst only nine months . And solicitation of contributions from civil service employes by political parties would be prohibited . Mayor Daley was not present to preside over the council meeting . The Tribune learned he left early Friday for a long weekend at his summer home in Grand Beach , Mich . PASSAGE OF THE Crosstown financing ordinance was largely academic , City Hall observer " ! ; pointed out , because Gov . Walker is still opposed to building the road . The federal government has ruled that in order for the city to receive any funds for the project , the city and the state must agree . Before construction can begin , the state is required to prepare engineering and environmental impact studies . Walker has not ordered them . The arrangement approved by the council Friday would commit the'city to pay 10 per cent of the construction costs for the expressway with the balance coming from the federal government . Marshall Subway , public works commissioner , testified earlier this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $L3 billion cost of the 22-mile project is probably out of date . THE COUNCIL , which approved the arrangement by a vote of 91 to 9 , threw out an amendment which would have set up a referendum to determine if Chicagoans favor construction of the expressway . The amendment was proposed by Cousins , Oberman , . Simpson . The three , along with Al . George J. Hagopian 30th , later voted against the financing arrangement . The major route proposed for the Crosstown lies near Cicero Avenue , from the junction of the Kennedy and Edens expressways south to 671h Street , then southeast to near 75th Street and east to the Dan Ryan Expressway . IN ** ACTION , the council sent to its Rules Comittee a resolution to create a special committee to study the feasibility of off-track horse race betting . It referred to the Committee on Buildings and Zoning Mayor Daley 's appointments of Marlton Hedlund , former 48th Ward alderwoman , to the city Board of Zoning Appeals and elevation of Jack Guthman , an'attoiney , from member tochairman of the board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ December for the Board of Education was approved , along with the board 's Issuance of $18 million in tax anticipation notes . An attempt by Simpson to get an explanation of how $454,343 of the ? city 's hotel tax receipts was spent in the last three months was ruled out of order .
