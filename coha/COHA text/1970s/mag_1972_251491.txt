" If he does n't come , " said World Chess Champion Boris Spassky of the Soviet Union , " then we will all go home . It 's as simple as that . " But nothing is ever simple when U.S. Grand Master Bobby Fischer is involved . After winning the right to play Spassky for the world title in Reykjavik , Iceland , the Brooklyn bad boy played a defiant gambit that threatened to stalemate the " Match of the Century . " Not satisfied with a record $125,000 purse ( previous record : $12,000 ) and a 30% share of TV and film rights , Fischer at the last minute demanded a 30% cut of the gate receipts . While Boris waited in Reykjavik , Bobby went into hiding in New York City and played a waiting game . The U.S.S.R. Chess Federation denounced his sulking as " blackmail " and " a crying violation of the rules without parallel in the history of any sports competition . " <P> One theory was that Fischer was waging a " war of nerves . " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James Slater , a millionaire chess buff . In an extraordinary move of his own , Slater doubled the purse with a gift of $125,000 . " Fischer has said that money is the problem , " he declared . " Well , here it is . My message to Fischer is : ' Come on out , chicken . ' " Fischer came out instantly . Saying that the offer was " incredible , generous and brave " and " I got ta accept , " he caught a jet to Reykjavik and arrived just five hours before the noon deadline set by the Federation Internationale des Echecs ( F.I.D.E. ) , the governing body of world chess . <P> Fischer 's belated arrival only served to heat up the cold war in Iceland . While Bobby slept , his second went in his stead to the noon meeting to determine who would have the first move in the best-of-24-game match . Spassky appeared but instead of drawing lots he stalked out of the room without explanations . Later he declared that he was " insulted " by his opponent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral right to play " and must suffer some " just punishment before there is a hope of holding the match . " Spassky , who maintained a cool , detached air throughout most of the negotiations , said : " I am the world champion . Now it is I who shall determine when or whether the match shall begin . " Moaned F.I.D.E . President Max Euwe : " I do n't understand it myself . When Spassky is here , Fischer does n't come . As soon as Fischer comes , Spassky runs away . " <P> At a press conference the next day , Spassky 's second spelled out the " just punishment " by making three demands : 1 ) a written apology from Fischer , 2 ) a condemnation of Fischer 's behavior by Euwe , and 3 ) an apology from Euwe for granting Fischer a two-day postponement in violation of F.I.D.E . rules . Euwe , 71 , a courtly former world champion ( 1935-37 ) from The Netherlands , immediately took the microphone and said : " Of course I condemn Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who does not ? " Claiming that " Fischer lives in another world , " Euwe admitted that he had violated the rules because " if I had not , there would be no match . "
