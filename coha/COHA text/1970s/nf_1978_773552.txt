txt // Papou , the patriarch , has long been half-bald , but his brown eyes , behind gold-rimmed glasses , are alert . He makes one think of those Caucasian centenarians whose great age has recently been traced , in part , to the strength of their families . " I have a brother in the old country who 's ninety-eight , " Papou said . " He goes hunting up in the Alps , follows the wild rabbits way up in the mountains , up in the caves . I do n't hunt here ; it 's dangerous . Here they make mistakes ; the hunters here get killed , instead of the deer . But God bless America . I have no wish to go home to Greece except for a visit . I know more people here now than I know in my village . I have my doctors here , my friends here , my grandchildren here , my car here . I 've been driving since 1919 . If I ca n't have a steering wheel , sweetheart , I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes in Worcester . Every chair he sits in becomes , for the while , a throne . He is his clan 's founder , and his fifth child and only son is its hero . Clans need heroes as much as they need founders ; at their best they have someone whose accomplishments the rest of the world can join them in applauding . For the clan he was born to , Nicholas Christos Gage fills this need superbly . His sisters talk of him as if they were reading from scripture . I have friends who have felt special all their lives because they came along after their mothers suffered five or six or seven miscarriages , and others who feel special because they were longawaited only children , but compared with Nick Gage , these people are like victims of child abuse . " When my mother had Nick Gage , oh boy , I swear we celebrate for forty days , " says Lilia , the third of his four sisters , who was six on the " hot hot day in July " in 1939 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had my aunt go get my grandfather and give him a special cap to wear called a capella , because after the four girls my mother finally has the son . Everyone is so happy that we hurry to make the special cakes called tiganites . For forty days we dance . " Nick Gage ? his sisters and kinfolk usually refer to him by his full name ? came from Greece at the age of nine with high resolve . Talented in mathematics , he thought he would become an engineer . When he won an essay contest , he changed his mind and decided on a writing career instead . Newspapers hired him early to do stories and articles . He started to earn money . He also helped his immigrating relatives . Streaming across the Atlantic in growing numbers , they needed someone to figure out tax returns , citizenship papers , driver 's licenses , and other American obstacles . Someone had to interpret their new country to them . The someone was Nick . // So it still goes . " Nobody would ever think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . He arranges immigration papers , advises about all manner of things , and works so hard on his own projects that Papou is " afraid he will squeeze his brains . " He has done screenplays , television series , books of nonfiction , a novel , and investigative reporting , most of it for the New York Times , whose Athens bureau he was sent to manage in the fall of 1977 . His Times colleagues and New York friends regard Nick as a dashing and generous fellow , quick to pick up checks , preoccupied with ambition , whose conversation never strays for long from his background . He looks something like certain Praxitelean statues . His sister Lilia , who helps her husband with the pizza , does n't look much like Nick except for her eyes and her hair , which , like his , is light brown . Lilia 's hair is teased into a beehive , a style popular among women one generation removed from peasantry , and one of the teeth in her dazzling and unfeigned smile is gold . She is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father . She provides a service no clan can do without : she is its switchboard . She is the one who knows , at any given time , where her eighty closest relatives are and what , more or less , is on their minds . She knows who is about to have surgery , who might be on the brink of engagement or marriage or divorce , who may be having what she calls " the trouble with the school , " and who has reservations to fly to , or return from , Athens . Someone in this clan is always packing or unpacking a suitcaseload of presents : sheets and pillowcases and towels and shawls for the other side of the Atlantic ; jars of holy water and charms to pin on children 's clothing to ward off the evil eye for this side . Lilia , born Ylikeria , believes in the power of the evil eye . So do most of her kinfolk . They take their superstitions seriously . ' When something is lost , they tie a knot in a towel , calling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they wo n't untie it till he helps them find what they 're missing . Above Lilia 's television set is a shelf which has become a sort of shrine . On the shelf are icons , framed family photographs , palm fronds , a string of red and blue Christmas tree lights , and a jar of holy water imported from Greece in a plastic pop bottle , from which she takes a sip " whenever I do n't feel so good . I swear , honest to God , it helps . " Ancient Greeks had holy altars with sacred fires where they worshipped their ancestors ; on Maxdale Street in Worcester things are not so different . This clan owes much of its vigor to the concentrated energy it gets from Papou as patriarch , Nick as hero and ambassador , and Lilia as switchboard . It also draws strength from the drama of its history ? so 1OZ FAMILIES central a figure as a mother , so recently slain by so vivid an enemy as the Communists ? and from the urgency of its task : to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sense of place is a source of this clan 's richness , too . Families tend to fall apart , as my own has begun to do , when their members are n't sure where on the face of the earth they belong . The more places a clan can manage somehow to hallow , the longer the clan will last . In this respect , the Worcester Greeks are wealthy . They know where their ancestors lie , on both sides of the ocean . Papou knows in which lot in which Worcester cemetery he 'll be buried . All these Greeks know where their work is , most of it in pizzas like the one I visit . They know where to go to worship , too , to Saint Spyridon 's Church on Russell Street , where they all get married and christened . And they know where to find one another . With the exception of Nick Gage , who has moved to that most acceptably remote of destinations , Athens , nobody is farther away than Pawtucket , Rhode Island . Lilia 's sister Alexandra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to college thirty miles away in Boston . " When somebody leaves the family , " she said , " we worry too much . " Homesickness is the least of this family 's worries . Should a pang of nostalgia for the Old World ever strike a Worcester Greek , he need only wait until Sunday to turn his radio dial to station WNEB or WORC , to listen to an hour of records which their listeners may dedicate , at $1a or $15 each , to honor name days , anniversaries , christenings or trips to Athens . " When Nick and I were married , " Joan Gage told me , " it took a whole extra hour for them to play all the records people dedicated to us . And when our children were born , they dedicated a lot more , mostly songs from Epirus . Eleni dedicated a song to Elenitsa called You Grew Up in My Hands . " ' Eleni , one of Nick 's numerous distant cousins , moved in with the Gages to help care for their children . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Nick gave her away . Joan Gage , Nick 's wife , is n't Greek . By heritage she is a Swedish Presbyterian , by birth a Minnesotan . She and Nick met at the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism . When they got their diplomas , in 1964 , Nick 's father met her and said , " Too bad she 's not Greek , I like that girl . " That girl did the best she could to become a Greek , converting to Nick 's religion and learning his language , bearing him three children and keeping on writing herself . We found plenty to talk about , the three of us , when a friend introduced us in New York . The more time we spent together , the more I heard about Massachusetts and the pre-Civil War house the Gages had // just bought . They always seemed to be running up there , so that Nick could give commencement addresses at his nieces ' and nephews ' schools , or to help dye eggs red for Easter , or to celebrate Christmas or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pizza . " They work hard at those pizzas , " Nick said . " The trouble with Greeks is that they are n't good organizers . They 're all chiefs and no Indians . You 'd think that with two or three hundred Greek pizzas within a seventy-mile radius of Worcester they might form an association , to buy the stuff they need more cheaply from the manufacturer , but no ? they each like to control their own shop . Same way with florists and other small businesses . It 's mainly a Byzantine culture now , but when I read Homer and Kitto and Edith Hamilton about the ancient Greeks I feel some connection with them , too . They had the same self-reliance and the same inability to organize . But you ought to come to Worcester sometime and see for yourself . " So I did . I got in the habit of stopping at the pizza even when I was not hungry , ordering an Extra Special to heat up later in whatever kitchen I was bound for , because an Extra Special makes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from dough baked fresh daily , on which is piled a layer of cheddar cheese . Atop the cheese go more layers : of ground beef , mushrooms , anchovies , sliced meatballs , sausage , baloney , pepperoni , green peppers , onions , and a final layer of cheddar . Nothing comes from a can ; all the ingredients are fresh . The name Extra Special is an understatement . Once I asked Prokopi Economou , Lilia 's husband , where the Extra Special recipe came from . Prokopi and his brother Christos manage their pizza restaurant together . Prokopi smiled , the sort of smile politicians wish for and ca n't often emulate . Then he tapped his remarkably round head . One of his nephews who happened to be around ? in this clan several nephews are always around ? protested . " It 's not your recipe , " said the nephew . " It 's my father 's . " " You 're wrong , " said Prokopi , whose American customers call him Paul . " I 'm the one who taught your father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pizza five years before you did , " said the nephew . " You worked for him before you got your own place ; that 's how you learned the recipe . " This argument never was settled . No matter . Such kidding is a constant ritual among Greeks . They joke with each other , quarrel with each other , hire each other , and when need be , lend each other money , paying it back with no interest , on the honor system . Once , at a picnic in Worcester in honor of the Prophet Elias , patron saint // of Nick 's native village , Nick told me that if for any reason he needed $300,000 right then , that very summer afternoon , " I could go around to the people at this picnic and collect it , in cash , no questions asked . " Not much cash seemed to be changing hands that afternoon , though , except for the man who went around collecting dues for the Liotes Association , the club for people from Lia . Nick paid his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cousin in a black peasant dress for giving us fresh pastry . She in turn thanked him for arranging for one of her sons to immigrate . A lot of thanking went on . But mostly , it was a day for dancing . The circle of dancers got so big it became a spiral , winding under the grove of oak trees . Bouzouki and clarinet players from the orchestra took turns doing solos . When the moment seized them , different Greeks advanced to the head of the spiral to do special acrobatic steps of their own . One picked up a glass of wine with his teeth , draining it dry . Nick , who led a dance or two himself , invited me to join the circle . It did n't matter , he said , that I did n't know the steps . It turned out he was right . People had better things to do , when I took the hands of strangers in that circle , than to look at my feet . People were smiling . They were smiling at the elderly women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polyester pastel maternity dresses , and young fathers holding their infants high up in the sky to pose for photographers . The sky that afternoon , everyone agreed , gave off a light that seemed remarkably Greek ? more Greek , some were saying , than that in Greece itself . " It is more Greek here than it is in Greece , " said Nick . " I was invited to Greek Week in Birmingham , Alabama , a while ago , and so was the Greek ambassador to this country , who was born in Athens . Even he did n't know how to do these dances . I kidded him , and said I would n't appoint a nondancing ambassador . People who live in the cities , they do n't keep up the village dances . " " But we danced plenty when we went to Greece , " said Prokopi , who had just returned with his family from their first trip home in eight years . They had been to see his parents , Lilia 's mother 's grave , and all their surviving relatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we danced until three-thirty in the morning , by the church up on the mountain , under the big tree that 's thousands of years old . " We have a fine trip , never mind that it cost eight or nine thousand dollars . We did n't go on a charter . Why should we take a charter ? I bought open return tickets , because what if my wife wants to stay longer , or come home sooner ? We want to stay there as long as we like . We took taxis back and forth between her village and mine . // The people in mine thought I sounded American , because after twenty-two years in this country I must talk Greek with an accent . " " We visited hundreds of people , " said Lilia , " but the first day we got there I did n't see anybody at all . I only went to my mother 's grave . I went there every other day , too , to light a candle . One night I went to sleep with an aunt , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in both the two villages was crying for my mother . I cry too , when I 'm there . It was terrible , when the Communists killed my mother . They captured me and tried to kill me , too , and they tried to make me a soldier , make me learn to shoot with the gun . I was hiding , I had nothing to eat , but some nice soldiers helped me escape to Macedonia , where my grandfather found me , and got word to my father that I was alive . My sisters and brother had already escaped to America , so then I went , too . Sometimes now people make fun of me , they say , Why you all the time so happy ? ' I say , ' I was unhappy as a young girl , I should be happy now . ' But I cry , I get mad , when I think of my mother . " In the old country , the kids they respect the parents more than here , " Lilia said . " My husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his father . He should be . Here , if you have to hit your son sometimes , you should be able to . The parents have the right to punish the son . Kids have to respect somebody . They need to be looked after . Even now , my son is nineteen , I wait up till he comes home . We never go to bed till the boys come home . " " On Father 's Day and Mother 's Day , " said Prokopi , " I send my parents ten dollars ? why not be a sport ? " " The clan , " Joan Gage said later , when we talked in her kitchen , " gives everybody terrific strength . There really is safety in numbers . This family , for example , gives you a prescribed behavior for every situation you can think of . No matter what tragedy might come along , they have it codified . They tell you what you 're supposed to do . If someone dies , you keen and wail and it makes you feel better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take him to the church to be blessed and up to a year to have a christening . On your son 's name day , you have a big party . On your daughter 's , you have a little one , if any . I guess these people are sexist ? sure they are ? but there 'd be no more point in telling them that than there would be to tell you or me that we were n't born with wings . " Nick is more conservative than any of his sisters . If one of our eighteen-year-old nieces comes for a visit , and goes out on a date , he 'll want to know where she is going , with whom , and how late . He 's a patriarch already . He really believes all those codes and rules ro6 FAMILIES of conduct . I myself grew up to be much more lenient and liberal , and therefore less secure . But I 'd be a far less happy person than I am now if I had married some All-American English major , and sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greeks , is everything . The only love match ' of any of Nick 's sisters ? the only marriage that was n't arranged ? is the only one that ended in divorce . Girls are very closely chaperoned until they get engaged . Engagement 's a very formal thing with a big party , and maybe a new set of rules , maybe not , depending on who the girl is and who her parents are . " Greeks define their relationships much more intricately than we do , so they 'll understand what they owe each other . The closer the bond , the greater the obligation . They have two different words , for example , for sister-in-law . Your brother 's wife is your nyfi , to whom you are less close than you are to your husband 's sister , who is called your kouniada . " The two of Joan 's kouniades whom I met were Lilia and Alexandra . They both live near enough to drop by at least once every day when Joan and Nick and their children are in Massachusetts , bringing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , and still do , because they live as close to each other as I at times have wished my own sister and I did . They live right next door . Their identical split-level houses were built the same year , by the same contractor , in a suburban section of Worcester . Their lives are uncannily symmetrical . Both their husbands own and run pizzas , both have two teen-age sons , both are so preoccupied with their clan that they have little time or energy left for the other neighbors on Maxdale Street , let alone the world beyond . As I talked to them I kept wondering , Could my sister Ann and I get on as well if we lived next door ? Would we want to , if by chance I regarded Decatur or she Manhattan as more than a buoying place for an occasional visit ? Would we abuse our siblings ' right to be less nice to each other than we ever would dare to be to anyone else ? Would the laughing rapport which we achieve at our best outbalance regressive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for many pairs of siblings , it might not . But Lilia and Alexandra are different . They probably could n't imagine living any farther apart than they do . " Each of us always knows what the other one is thinking , " as Alexandra said . In their early years in this country , after all , even when they were young brides , they and their father and brother and sisters all lived under the same roof . Pizza made them prosperous enough to escape , but they did n't elect to go very far . // The day I chose to visit their house seemed a promising one ; it happened to be the same day Lilia and Prokopi were having the priest over from St. Spyridon 's to bless their house and banish the evil eye . An exorcism ! Would that not be dramatic ? How could it fail to be , with a robed , chasubled , bearded Orthodox clergyman moving from room to room , swinging his censer , murmuring incantations , telling the devil to get out of here and leave these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the priest did , the day I first went to Lilia 's , but the whole occasion was somehow strangely prosaic . It was rather as if the exterminator were coming . Papou , who lives with Lilia and her family , was n't even there , and Prokopi left as soon as the ritual was finished . The priest sat down for coffee with Lilia and her sons , and they chatted in Greek . Later she told me what he had said . " ' You got to believe in God . When you believe in the religion , you get up in the morning , you wash your face , you make the sign of the cross , and you thank God you have a good day today . ' The priest tells my sons to listen to their father and mother , they know better than you . Watch it . Do n't mix it up with the bad kids . My boys believe him , they do respect . I teach my boys religion . It would be nice to have the daughter , because when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but so far I 'm happy with my boys . " For their part , her boys seemed eager for the priest 's visit to end . I was , too ; I wanted to see how Alexandra 's house differed from Lilia 's . It did n't differ much . Her dominant color was green , to Lilia 's yellow , but she had the same furniture of puffed , tufted , plastic velvet . A plastic cover protected a plastic bouquet of flowers from dust . The windowshades were drawn . Maybe at home in Greece this family had seen enough sun , enough dirt . Certainly they had n't seen enough television ; only during the priest 's visit was Lilia 's set turned off . " I do n't like parties as much as my sister does , " said Alexandra , " and I do n't like furniture as much as I used to , either . I used to be crazy about the furniture , but I do n't think about it now . What I think about now are the soap operas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guiding Light . Sometimes I sit all afternoon watching the television . It relaxes me , makes me feel part of more families . " I used to sleep with a dictionary under my pillow , and think I might want to go on to more school , but I do n't think that now . My brain is too old now . What am I going to do , if I go to school now ? I 'm forty-three ; how long am I going to live , another forty or forty-io8 FAMILIES five years ? If I do n't see the world , at least I see Cape Cod . That 's okay . I know enough , I 've been enough places . Our other sister , she wanted to be a doctor , but she quit school when she was sixteen to work in a bank , to help my father . " Once Nick speculated that if he had stayed in Greece he might have become a shepherd on a hillside , or a taxi driver in the city . Never , said his father . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked to send Nick to college , even in the old country , " Papou said . " I 'm so proud of my son I 'd like to walk up on the air . He knows everything he 's ever learned . He never forgets . My own education was different . I went to school only in the evenings . I was a moneymaker ; what I learned was from school in the evenings and what my customers taught me . But money you can lose . If you have millions you can lose it . Education you ca n't lose . God bless America , my grandchildren are born on good soil . It 's a dream come true for my grandchildren to go for vacations to England , to Italy , to France . " America is different from Greece . The Greeks do n't like the girls , because in the old country they have to pay the boy to marry the girl , but in America it 's different . In America my four girls all get married right away . Girls like mine are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'd like it fine . God bless America a million times ! Bread alone , if you eat it in the States here , it tastes like a steak . I love the history of my old country , the old people , but not the new people . The new ones are pro-Communist . I ca n't forgive them . My son , he forgives everybody . He 's not so mean as me . " Every time I went to Joan 's and Nick 's , at least a dozen relatives and neighbors were wandering in through the porch from the yard to the kitchen , and back out again . On my last visit , Christy and some neighbor children were outside jumping rope . One of the neighbor boys came in to borrow a piece of paper , on which he later spelled out " I LOVE YOU MISES GAGE . " Mises Gage gave him a hug . Elenitsa was on the floor of the porch , transferring animals into and out of her Noah 's Ark . Papou sat on the reclining chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Nine months after I got here I bought my shop in Worcester , for $300 , which in those days was a lot of money . I worked peddling vegetables , selling fruits and vegetables to millionaires ' wives , and setting up pins in a bowling alley , and working in a factory that made tea strainers . In other factories I made looms and pistols . I was class Al in the war , but they did n't make me wear the khaki because what I was doing was more important , I was making the crankshafts . Did // you ever see how they make the crankshafts ? It 's rough , very rough ? I made thirty-two crankshafts a day . " My big mistake , my foolish mistake , was not bringing my wife over right away . She was fourteen years younger than me , I should have brought her here with me . She told stories of what she heard about the States , she told of swimming pools big as a room . " " But she love the family too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they take my child away , I 'm going to stand up and they can shoot me , ' and this is what they did . " Lilia would probably do the same thing now , if life in Worcester obliged her to , for her own two sons . " That 's why we work so hard in the pizza , " she said . " I work sometimes fifteen hours a day , till my whole body is all swollen . But we have to do it for the kids , so they wo n't have to work as hard themselves . " " The kids , they do n't always appreciate , " said Prokopi , " but you have to do it for them anyway . " " But maybe we do too much for them , " said Joan . " How can we raise them not to be spoiled ? Is it good for them to grow up having everything they want ? " " Maybe you 're right , " said Alexandra . " Maybe bad experiences make them strong , keep them from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want my kids to have the life we had . " This issue , of course , will never be resolved . Marina , youngest of Papou 's thirteen grandchildren , gurgles on behalf of all her generation , and accepts the homage of her aunt Alexandra . " Hello , Kukla , " says Alexandra . " Kukla means dolly . Hello , dolly . " The dolly produces something like a smile . So , at once , do all the rest of us : Lilia , Eleni , Joan and I. Eleni gives me a quizzical look and asks the others a question , in Greek . Joan translates . Eleni wonders how I can run all around the countryside alone in my car , free to come and go as I wish . Papou had seemed to wonder the same thing , when I came into this house earlier this afternoon : he told me I " walked like a captain , " which Joan said was n't necessarily a compliment . All the Greek women confess they find it odd that I should live so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about me to come right out and say they wish I would get married . Alexandra wonders if I ever have tasted ouzo , the anise-flavored Greek liqueur . I have , often , but am pleased to accept more now . What luck : in the only bottle of ouzo at hand there is only a scant inch of the liquor , which means that if I drink it , my chances of finding a husband will increase . // Alexandra mentions that this is her name day . Everyone agrees that if she were a man , they 'd be having a big party to honor her . Since they are n't , I lift my glass to toast her , and the others raise their cups of coffee . " Maybe by my next name day you 'll be married , " says Alexandra , " if you drink the last of the ouzo . You should have a big wedding , like Joan 's and Nick 's , when we roasted the six lambs . Have a big wedding , and invite a lot of Greeks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Eleni does n't speak English , but she follows what is being said . She runs to another room to show me the pictures Joan took of her own wedding , the year before . One picture shows her and her husband at the reception , beneath a tree in the Gages ' yard . In the other picture they sit rather shyly on a bed , under a canopy , looking into each other 's eyes . She is wearing Joan 's bridal gown , which I recall having seen hanging from the second-floor railing , so its train could trail down unwrinkled . The Greeks are indeed fond of weddings , as they are of all ceremonies , even small ones . Now , for instance , Prokopi and his son Fotios , who have been out in the yard with the children , declare that they and Lilia must leave to go home . Prokopi 's brother Chris is in charge of the pizza tonight , so they can go home to watch Home Box Office . " It costs more , " says Prokopi , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the cat food . It 's worth it to spend more , to keep the boys away from the robbers and the bad kids . We need to keep the family together . " So Prokopi and Lilia get ready to leave . So does their son Folios , who is called Freddy . Freddy is a big tough kid in the middle of his teens , who looks like a football player . Before he leaves , he bends down to squat on the floor of the porch to give his three-year-old cousin Elenitsa , whom he is sure to see tomorrow , a kiss goodbye . Lilia will surely see Christy tomorrow , too , but before she leaves she scoops him up and lifts him high and gives him the kind of hug most people only get at airports , after long absences . " Gee , Christy , " says one of the American neighbors who has come to play . " You 're lucky to have so many people who love you . " " Christy is named for your father , right ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , and I 'm named for his father . " " And he 'll name his son for you . " " He 'd better , " smiles Nick , " or I 'll have both his legs broken . " // This web of secure connectedness is hard to leave . I almost want it to trap me . I keep postponing my departure , hanging around an extra hour and then another . When I do finally back out of the driveway , I make a side trip to the pizza , for an Extra Special to heat up at home later . Things are frantic at the pizza . Big crowds hold numbers , waiting for their orders . Prokopi 's brother and his children rush from oven to sink to cutting board to cash register . The phone rarely stops ringing . This family is in high gear , working together to produce something that it would seem at least half of Westboro is eager to consume . They do n't sit around wondering how come they work so hard . They know why . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than they did . And , to be sure , their children will grow up knowing , with a certainty that wouid have made their ancestors marvel , where their next meal will come from . Hunger wo n't plague them . But choices probably will . People will enter their lives who know nothing of the rituals of Lia and Worcester , becoming their friends , offering them possibilities . They will be distracted . They will spend less time dyeing eggs red on the Thursday before Easter , and doing the dances at the picnics . The fabric that keeps their clan a clan will unravel . Cut it out , I tell myself , as I pull onto the interstate . Do n't be mawkish . Why feel any misgivings about the future of such ostensibly lucky children as Fotios and Christy and Elenitsa and Marina and all their cousins ? Why should I envy their parents , and theirs and theirs , the urgent clarity of the problems it is and was their lot to solve ?

Sidney , more than any of the others , has kept his parents reliably supplied with fresh naches ? honors ? and reasons to kvell : full scholarships , graduation cum laude , smart grandsons , Junior Chamber of Commerce awards . They did n't like his marrying a gentile and they did n't like his firm 's transferring him to Tulsa , but they liked it fine when he sent them a copy of Who 's Who in the South and Southwest with his name listed . Sidney 's father is an exterminator . His company sends him all over // the Twin Cities , in an unmarked truck when he visits fancy suburbs , with a pressurized sprayer of Malathion . When Sidney tells of problems at his office , which he does often , his father says : " Look , you do n't have to work standing up , do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a desk , a door he can lock , and a secretary . He gets paid to go to conferences and seminars . He has earned enough to buy a big old house on a two-acre plot filled with trees . He loves that house and he loves those trees . Before his wife got so engrossed in graduate school , where she is studying to become a marriage counselor , he used to love preparing French toast , on Sunday mornings , with her and the boys . Theirs was a family with all kinds of rituals . Now the bewildered boys keep their sleeping bags at Sidney 's tiny studio apartment downtown . He tries to pretend it is fun , having them there weekends , but they know better and so does he . His parents keep writing to ask after these boys , rarely mentioning their mother . Even though Patsy became their daughter-in-law in a Jewish ceremony , they never really liked her . For a couple of months Sidney 's answers to their letters have avoided all mention of the looming divorce , but when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their vacation in Tulsa , the news can no longer be concealed . When Sidney tells his parents , on the phone , his mother consoles him , advising him to find a Jewish girl next time . His father agrees . " Feh ! " says the older man . " Goyim ! What do they know from families ? " Some of us know plenty . A Jewish friend was amazed when I told him once of my inherited compulsion , on arriving in a strange town , to phone not only my own relatives but other people 's as well . " I thought only Jews did that , " he said . The once clear line between Jewishness and the American mainstream grows ever more blurred . A North Dakota friend once wrote to me about a schoolmate 's wedding she had gone to in Santa Monica : Judy married a nice Jewish boy who is a paraplegic and has a good job with the state of California , working for the disabled . They had a gorgeous rabbi , mishpocha from the entire eastern seaboard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deaf contingent , with sign language interpreter right beside the chuppa canopy , several common-garden-variety L.A. freaks , Rinpoche devotees complete with third-eye jewel in middle of forehead and yards of flowing muslin , a free spirit who is single and eight months // preggers , another free spirit who is very , very gay , Judy 's parents from Bismarck , and little me . If only the Founding Fathers could see this , I kept mumbling into my champagne . I would like to have been at that wedding myself . It sounded far more heartening than most of the recent news about the ancient Jewish tribal passion . That passion , which has sustained and defined most Jews for many centuries , has lately and measurably begun to cool . Councils of rabbis convene to lament the leap of divorce rates among their traditionally monogamous followers , and even among themselves . Alcoholism , once all but unknown among Jews , is so no more ? far from it . Elderly Jews can be just as forlorn and neglected as elderly anyone else . Tabloid series bewail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , imperishable stock figure , the Jewish mother . Good riddance , some say . Those tribal bonds , like houses with too much custom and ceremony , could suffocate . No doubt at times they could and did and do , but it is disturbing to think that Jews , having survived Pharaoh and the Holocaust , should feel as unhinged by the late twentieth century as the rest of us do . The rest of us in this society have relied greatly on Jews for what many of us lack ourselves : an invisible but quite effective family network , sustained by ritual and elastic enough to encircle whoever needs encircling . Jewish families , better acquainted than most with grief , by hearsay at least , have a tradition of compassion , irony , and humor , not to say resilience , which is contagious . Arriving in Iowa City to teach for a semester at the state university , I was asked to a brunch one Sunday where I met a painter , also there as a guest teacher , who turned out to come from my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what she missed , her answer was immediate : " Yiddish ! " I knew what she meant . I too missed , among other things , the shortcuts provided by the Yiddish language . In English we say " my son-in-law 's or daughter-in-law 's mother or father ; in Yiddish the words are macheteneste or machuten . Ever so cumbersomely we tell of " my brothers and sisters and their wives and husbands and their children and their spouses ' parents and siblings and a few of their oldest friends " ; how much simpler to call such a network a mishpocha . I have been relying on mishpochas myself , Jewish and otherwise , since long before I ever heard the word . The more mishpochas I can belong to , on however temporary a basis , the better off I feel . Once , on a visit to my own family in Illinois , I broke out in a sudden and // annoying skin rash . Where did I turn for help ? Where but to my niece 's friend Rozzy 's father 's celebrated " Uncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Macon County . Ordinarily people must wait weeks to see Dr. Burstein , but the mishpocha connection entitled me to immediate treatment . The rash , thanks to a salve prescribed by Uncle Sonny , disappeared at once . So , in other places over the years , have a number of less visible ailments . I felt uneasy about moving into an apartment in Coralville , Iowa , until I found the Welts next door . Theirs was not a large mishpocha , consisting as it did only of Peter and Elinor , but it did the job . It made me feel encircled . Of a Sabbath eve I could find Peter and Elinor lighting the candelabra which was the only object Peter had brought with him from Berlin . Whenever I felt the need , and sometimes when I did n't , I could hear tales of Elinor 's girlhood in Omaha , where she had taught Hebrew school and where her bas mitzvah ? thirteenth birthday ceremony ? had been the biggest that city had ever seen . I also felt uneasy a few months later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of guest teaching . I knew virtually nobody there , and could only hope that the legendary southern hospitality would ward off any seizures of loneliness . It did n't , until I telephoned Elinor Welt 's sister Bonnie Pike and her family in Atlanta , and met Burt and Dot Sparer in Athens . The Sparers at once invited me to their daughter Lisa 's has mitzvah . More persuasively than I would have thought possible , Lisa told at that ceremony how lucky she felt to be a 13-year-old Jew in Athens . She sang part of the service herself , at the lectern . So did the rabbi . So did her father and her mother and her twin brother and their dentist . Her grandmother kvelled . So did her Prussian great-grandmother Omama , on a visit from the " healthrelated facility " where she lives in New York . So did I. Once I heard of a father who not only planned but cooked himself a banquet to celebrate his daughter 's becoming a woman . That father , of course , was Jewish . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obliged its girls , as a puberty rite , to catch water insects with their mouths and kill a tethered chicken by sitting on its head . Most of us have lost all touch with such open acknowledgment of reality . In 1949 , when an Episcopalian friend of mine got all dressed up for the first date of his life , his father looked at him and said , " Well , you 're looking pretty spiffy , are n't you ? " and that was that . So much for the onset of manhood and whatever it might imply . Once I saw a litter of Labrador Retrievers born during a dinner // party on Central Park West . The timing was amazing ? a puppy arrived at the end of each course . Otherwise , like most middle-class Americans , I have witnessed births and deaths only on screen . Genteel people , after all , arrange to do such things in hospitals , not in public . We may send Mother 's Day cards and mark other guiltinspired " holidays , " but as a nation we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a funeral to remind most families of the ultimate , and some do n't get together even then . I find this regrettable . I think there are plenty of lesser occasions worthy of attention , too . " Every day , " as Joan Didion once wrote , " is all there is . " If we would follow the Jewish example and enliven our days with more ritual , we would be better off. * My own clan owes a good part of its strength to the reflexive way we dye and hide the eggs , wave the sparklers , bake the cakes , carve the pumpkins , stuff the turkeys , deck the halls , and ring out the old . Little of this has anything to do with theology ; left to our own devices we did n't say grace , and our churchgoing was occasional and perfunctory . These practices stem , instead , from our need to acknowledge seasons and solstices . Religions have endured , among other reasons , because of the scaffolding they provide from which to suspend such traditions . All the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , feel strongly about ceremonies that link them to the earth , to those who have trod it before them , and to one another . I only wish more of my Jewish friends were in the habit of marking Passover with dinners called Seders , a 3,200-year-old ritual honoring the bonds that link individuals to families to Judaism . In springtime I used to make my wistful way along upper Broadway , past shops barred shut for Passover and beaming neighbors on their way to and from temples and Seders . No Jew at Christmas could feel more left out . But at last I learned the power of the carefully placed hint , and one spring got asked to what must have been the two most heartening Seders on the Atlantic seaboard , one in my own apartment building and the other at several pushed-together tables in Philadelphia . Twice I got to sing " Dayenu " and the song about the one kid goat , eat the food , drink the wine , hear the Four Questions and the fearsome list of plagues the Hebrews had barely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mishpocha . After the Philadelphia Seder the daughter of the household told how , when she first went to college , her Presbyterian roommate shyly // asked , " Ellen , is kosher a spice ? " It is n't . Kosher , Ellen explained , means among other things having two sets of china , one for meat dishes and the other for those containing milk . Kosher households need a lot of cupboards . " One year I said screw these dishes , I ca n't stand all these dishes , " my New York hostess told me , " but I figured I had to keep the whole thing going for the sake of my mother-inlaw . These things die out if somebody does n't keep them going , and the somebody in our family seems to be me , so I figured it was my drang . But you know who raised a fuss , when I threatened to get rid of all the dishes ? Not my mother-in-law . My kids . " The next year I was invited to a New Jersey Seder by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Passover before . I almost did n't go , figuring that these two absences would make the occasion too private and too gloomy . But then I remembered Jerry 's telling how he had felt something oddly like joy when he , as eldest son , had been required to throw the first handful of sod onto his father 's lowered coffin . " It gave me a feeling of rightness and profound connectedness , " he said , " because I remembered seeing my father do the same thing for his father . " How could Jerry , at 24 or any other age , preside over a depressing Seder ? I went , and it was n't . It healed not only the sting of death but several less specific anxieties . I know another young couple named Diana and Daniel , who live together . They are n't married . Diana 's widowed mother wishes intensely that they were . A member of the Great Books Society of Hartford , Connecticut , she knows better than to sit shive for her daughter , as if she were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two women are together , without a recital of the virtues of wedlock . " She even tries to bribe me , " Diana says , as she and Daniel and I drink tea and eat banana bread on the floor of their three-room apartment . " She says she 'll get me a Cuisinart if we get married . A big part of the problem is that she does n't know what to call us . Daniel she refers to as my er ? friend . ' As for what I am to him , that really stymies her . Slut ' just does n't have the right ring to it . " " She thinks I 'm ripping Diana off , " says Daniel , who is working toward his doctorate in history , " because Diana earns more money than I do . " Diana is an advertising copywriter trainee . " She would n't even come to visit us for two months after we moved into this apartment , " says Diana . " When she did , we thought maybe we ought to lay a sword @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we go to her place , I sleep alone in the basement , " says // Daniel . " Maybe Diana 's cousin 's wedding next week will mollify her some . " " Maybe , on the other hand , it wo n't , " says Diana . " You want to see a family drama , you ought to come to that wedding with us , " she tells me. " 14y cousin Sherry is marrying a convert ! " " But Gil does n't like to talk about his conversion , " says Daniel . " He figures it 's private , which makes me like him a lot more than I usually like accountants . When Sherry 's father got divorced from his second wife , Gil wrote him a terrific letter , quoting some ancient rabbi who said how a good divorce is better than a bad marriage . " " Sherry 's father got divorced twice ? " " No , his first wife ? Sherry 's mother , Esther ? died five years ago . After that he was married for just ten months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Haifa to look for a husband . " " It was the idea of it that got him , " says Daniel . " The idea of a galut Jew , one of the Diaspora , marrying someone from Israel , appealed to his sense of romance . That and the blending of families ? Shulamith had five kids , he has four ? he loved the idea of being an Old World patriarch . " " Those five kids came here speaking only Hebrew , " says Diana . " You talk about dynamics , you should have seen those nine kids together at Uncle Howard 's dinner table . " " He misses those kids a lot more than he misses Shulamith , " says Daniel . " Who could miss Shulamith ? " asked Diana . " When she went back to Haifa , Uncle Howard practically gave a street dance to celebrate . " " What did she do that was so awful ? " " Oh , gossip about his inadequacies to the neighbors , ask to use the neighbors ' phones and make calls ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exterior there turned out to be even more coldness . Now he 's on the lookout for somebody new : someone who 's interested , he told me , in three things : the English language , sex , and music . He plays the oboe , you see . " " He has found a lady friend , " said Daniel , " but she 's nineteen years younger , and wants kids , and he 's not sure it would be fair for him to be sixty when a child of his was ten . " " I know a man who 's eighty who has a child aged ten , " I told them , " and that family is one of the better ones I know of . " " Anybody who tries to make recipes or draw diagrams for how to construct a family , " said Daniel , " is either stupid or arrogant . " " Or both , " said Diana . " Come with us to the wedding . " // I did go to the wedding . Like the exorcism I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was less interesting than what happened before it and after . Not that the dogwoods were n't in perfect bloom , outside the suburban synagogue 's picture window . Not that the rabbi did n't wax metaphoric , evoking as he did " the sculptor Michelangelo , who said , It is n't I , it 's the form embedded in the rock that 's important ; I just chip away at the excess to reveal that form . ' In that same way , Sherry and Gilbert , you now have the beautiful privilege of chipping away at the excess in each other . " Your essential natures have been set by your families ? however you view one another and act toward one another , your family traditions will stand in the background , waiting to give whatever support you might need . But now it is time for the real you to emerge . May you never grow tired of the labor . " " We should have given them chisels for a wedding present , " Diana whispered to me . Her mother , sitting on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's mother . Gilbert stamped on the glass . Sherry smiled under the canopy . They kissed . Flashbulbs popped . We all headed for the reception in the garden behind Sherry 's widowed father 's gigantic house . We represented , you might say , many walks of life . Some among us wore suits that must have cost four hundred dollars , while others looked as if they belonged on the park benches of Broadway in the nineties , mumbling and feeding pigeons . " Why am I so popular all of a sudden with the bugs ? " asked Sherry 's father 's Aunt Ida . " Look , even in my coffee cup there 's a little living something just flew in . He should live and be well , of course , but somewhere else . " " I wish Esther could have been here today , " said Bubbi , Ida 's sister and Howard 's mother . " I kept thinking how proud she would be . But there was n't time to brood on that or anything else . Such a day ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this ! Bubbi that ! The hem 's gone out of my dress ! ' I had to be an actress , pretending to be a lot calmer than I felt . " " It must be nice to be so needed , " said Aunt Ida . " Not needed , wanted , " said Bubbi . " You 're wanted too , Ida , and you know it . Howard wants us all here . But when he thanked me for coming , I said What are parents for ? ' " " You 've worked hard enough now , Mom , " said Howard . " No more kitchen duty . Why do you think we hired the cateress ? Let her do the work ? you take it easy . " The cateress , a graduate of Erhard Seminar Training , was an inMISS // spired cook . Spinach snuggled in her cannelloni . Her wedding cake was fruitcake , which she had learned was Gil 's favorite . When everyone exclaimed over giant , fish-shaped salmon salad , arched under fins made of cucumbers , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Both my mother and I have perfect taste . " " But it looks like World Wars Three , Four and Five in that kitchen , " said Bubbi . " I was just trying to help . I 've been helping all my life . You think it was easy , coming here from the Ukraine when I was eighteen ? " " I 'm sure it was n't , " I said . " You 're right , young lady , " said Bubbi . " I 'd work from seven in the morning to seven in the evening , and once when I did n't have any money I walked all the way from Canal Street to 125th . " " Guess how old I am ? " asked Zaide , Bubbi 's husband . " Seventy , maybe ? " I said . " Seventy plus sixteen ! But I 'm feeling good , and I 'm feeling proud . " " You should , " I told him . " I liked the prayer you said when you blessed the challa . " " How do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know lots of Jewish families . " " You see a good Jewish family starting today , " said Bubbi . " Is n't that Gilbert a doll ? " " I could go for him myself , if I were a hundred years younger , " said Aunt Blanche . " Can I bring you a drink ? " asked Zaide . " No , Dad , you sit still , " said Howard . " Here , let 's have a special drink . " From a cabinet on the porch adjoining the garden he took a wine bottle whose label read " MAZEL TOV , SHULAMITH AND HOWARD . " " Oh Uncle Howard , " said Diana , " you do n't still have that stuff around ? From such a sad mistake of a wedding as that ? " " Just this one bottle is left , " said Howard . " Let 's finish it off . " He poured glasses of what turned out to be exceptionally sweet Michigan burgundy , the last of a case he had been given for his wedding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he told me , " is what I call decathecting ? separating myself from the memory of that whole big mistake . It is n't easy , but I 'm coming to see Shulamith as the extremely troubled , extremely stubborn lady she was . She never wanted to trust me , so I finally and reluctantly had to realize that I could n't trust her , either . But who ever thinks about trust ? I never thought about trust in my marriage with Esther , any more than I thought about having two lungs . That 's Esther there , " he said , pointing // above the cabinet to a photograph of a woman with large , tender eyes and a nose so magnificent I remarked on it . " Once someone asked Esther if she had ever thought of having the girls ' noses fixed , " Howard said . " Can you imagine ? Would n't it be criminal to tamper with a nose like that ? " " It would , " I said . " Shulamith used to call this house Esther @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our big mistakes was to start a whole new marriage on such old ground . If I get married again , we 'll start on neutral territory . I 'm thinking of selling this house now ? it 's much too big for just two children left at home and me ? but I do n't want to do that until I find a new wife . What I 'd like to find meanwhile is a couple to move in with us , so there would n't be so much wasted space . If the wife of the couple would do the cooking , I 'd let them live here free . " " People are always telling me I should sell my big house and move to some singles condominium , " said a divorced cousin of Diana 's named Yvonne . " I guess it would be sensible , now that the divorce is final , now that my four boys are all grown and gone , but I just ca n't see living in a tiny place . I like big houses and the sounds of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latch , so I 've taken in lodgers . They have kitchen privileges . Sometimes they and I have breakfast together . " " Like an old-fashioned boarding house , " said Daniel . " It does n't sound bad . It sounds sort of nice . " " What happened to Al ? " asked Diana , of Yvonne 's ex-husband . " He 's moved to California . He has a new wife who makes the sort of fuss over him I never could , after we stopped being infatuated with each other . " " How long did the infatuation last ? " asked Daniel . " Two , three years , " said Yvonne . " Until our boys started coming . When all four were born , Al took to calling me Mother . ' " " Oh God , " said Diana . " He did n't see why I wanted to get my master 's in chemistry when the kids were in school ? he 'd say , You 're just a victim of Women 's Lib . " " You 'll find somebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I 'm not in any big rush , " said Yvonne , " but I am looking . I keep busy . I 've joined a Single Professionals group ? we go skiing , we play tennis and bridge , we go to the theater , we have book reviews . Next month we 're having a discussion of The Prophet . " " Each to his own , " mumbled Diana . // " What was that , young lady ? " asked her mother . " What 's going on in here ? " asked Gilbert , the bridegroom , coming out with Sherry to the porch where we sat . " Just family undercurrents , " said Diana . " Undercurrents ? " said Daniel . " Are you kidding ? This family does n't have undercurrents , it has tidal waves ! Hey , where are you guys going on your honeymoon ? " " Los Angeles , " said Gilbert , " to visit some relatives . " " But we 're really not flying there till morning , " said Sherry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're going to stay in a hotel near the airport ! I figure if you do n't stay in a hotel the night of your wedding , then when do you ? I 've only stayed in one hotel before this in my life , and that was when I was ten , with five of us in one room . " " Let 's have some more wine , " said Howard , reaching for the bottle labeled " MAZEL TOV . " " Not that stuff , " said Gilbert . " Hold on a second . " He went to another room and brought back some champagne . " This is more like it , " he said as he popped the cork and filled our glasses . " L'chaim , " he said as he lifted his own in a toast . " That means to life , ' " said Zaide , for my benefit . " She knows , " said Diana as we clicked glasses . Now and then I think about marrying a Jewish man myself . In a life beset with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the few constants . One of these , fifteen years my senior , was a poet named Ben with whom I traveled to England several summers ago . We did n't hit it off . We were both more relieved than sad when , after five quarrelsome weeks , Ben decided to fly off alone to visit friends in Sweden . There , mercifully , he met Sigrid , a serene and distinguished chemical engineer with three grown children . Soon Ben and Sigrid were rearranging their lives to spend all the time they could together . " As a couple , " I heard from another friend of Ben 's who met Sigrid before I did , " they 're like some improbable transistor radio made from odd bits of wire found on the streets of Calcutta , all tangled and twisted . To look at such a radio you 'd never think it could possibly work , but the amazing thing is that it does ? it works wonderfully . " Ben and Sigrid spent most of the year together ? her profession brought her often to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decades of privacy and independence , " he told me when enough time had elapsed for us to renew our friendship , " I ca n't quite give it // all up , not even for her . These separations give us breathing space , and make me appreciate all the more what we have when we 're together . You know something ? I never knew anything could be so good . " " Mazel tov , " I told him , so truly happy for their good fortune that I was n't even jealous . If it could happen to them , I figured , then maybe it could to me too someday . And what difference did it make , at their ages , if they did n't commit themselves legally ? But a year later came one of the most astonishing letters I have ever received , with a Swedish stamp , addressed in Ben 's unmistakable blackslanting hand . " Guess what Sigrid and I did last week , " the letter said , after a paragraph of inquiries about my health and comments on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief magistrate in Sigrid 's town registry ? " she must have been on leave from the dog licensing department , " Ben speculated ? had pronounced the necessary words . Ben , everyone figured , must have been the oldest first-time groom in all the history of Uppsala . His knees had knocked . His blood had felt like sherbet . But at the age of 56 he had done what all his life he had been avoiding . A fortnight before Sigrid could leave Sweden , Ben had to return to the States . Soon he made a trip to the Long Island nursing home where for some years his mother had been languishing . When I first knew Ben we would go to that nursing home together to visit the old woman , whose life had not been easy . Widowed before Ben was even born , she had long ago buried her only other child . She had spent her adult life selling sportswear in a department store , and on days when she felt strong she would recall for us the code expressions she and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't know what they were saying . " If a strange or crazy-looking customer should come in , " she told us once , " and I 'd notice him and want to tell the girl at the next cash register , I could n't just say , Get a load of that one , will you ? ' so I 'd call out Miss Cook ! Miss Cook ! ' ? which sounds like Yiddish for take a look ' ? as if I wanted the supervisor to come . Or , if I was having trouble closing a sale ? if a customer who had been just about to buy a ninety-dollar suit was starting to lose interest ? I could n't call Help ! ' so what I 'd say was Miss Hogan phoned ! ' That meant Come quick , before this customer gets away ! ' " It saddened me to learn that as Ben 's mother grew more frail , she no longer told such tales . When I asked Ben how she was , he usually answered , " She 's just there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I get // mixed up .. " But the day he visited after his return from Sweden , she was n't mixed up at all . This time , when her only surviving son broke to her the most momentous news of his life , all vagueness fled the 88-year-old woman 's countenance . " She drew herself up in her chair in strictest maternal fashion , " Ben wrote to me , " and said , I hope you married a Jewish girl . ' " Ben does n't normally tell Jewish mother jokes . He agrees with Irving Howe that " sentimentalism is the besetting sin of the Jewish turn to ethnicity . " For Sholom Aleichem as for T. S. Eliot as for James Joyce , as Howe once said in a commencement address , " the province , the ethnic nest , remains the point from which everything begins and without which , probably , it could not begin ; but the province , the ethnic nest , is not enough , it must be transcended .

Hurry Back ONCE , ON A STREET CORNER near the Mason-Dixon line , I stood with a man from Louisiana waiting for a light to change . We were n't in any special hurry to get where we were going , but the light stayed red for so long that I lost my patience . Seeing no traffic coming from either side , and being by nature a hurrying , jaywalking Yankee , I dashed across . My friend stayed put until the light turned green , then ambled over to join me . " There you have it , " he said . " The whole difference between a northern and a southern family upbringing . " " What have families got to do with traffic lights ? " " The way I was raised , " he explained , " I 'd no more think of disobeying a red light than you would , apparently , of holding one sacred .

As Herbert Gutman has made quite clear in The Black Family in Slavery and Freedom ( Pantheon , 1977 ) , they are wrong who would claim that black families are , or ever have been , weak ones . Gutman quotes a slave ship captain whose diary in 1682 , includes this pas-sage : ... I once happened to have aboard a whole family , man , wife , three young boys , and a girl , brought here one after another at several places ; and can not but observe here what mighty satisfaction these poor creatures expressed to be so come together again , though in bondage . For several days successively they could not forebear shedding tears of joy , and continually embracing and caressing one another , which moving me to compassion I ordered they should be better treated aboard then commonly we can afford to do it ..

They 're also harder to figure out . Sometimes they extend in pretty funny ways ? just think of all the kings and queens crowned by all the krewes at Mardi Gras . " Think and hear and read and watch and marvel , because " whether you like them or not , " as my southern friend went on , " families here are different from other families , as Fitzgerald wrote about the rich . We 're different because we 're a sight more familial . In the south , more than anywhere else in this whole country , the bonds of family can tighten into bands . " So I was to learn for myself , when I spent ten weeks in the south in the spring of 1975 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The journalism school // at the University of Georgia asked me down as a visiting lecturer to teach a one-term course . This , I figured , was my chance to investigate the myths about the clans of the south . I hoped they would be still true . Behind and among the Bonanza Sirloins and mobile home parks and shopping malls I knew I would find as readily in Georgia as in Montana , I hoped there would be families as distinctive as the accents of the south . I figured it should n't be hard to get some firsthand sense of what southern clans were all about . Those clans , I further figured , would engulf any well-meaning and curious visitor with their legendary hospitality . On the last point I was somewhat mistaken . " Ten weeks , " someone later told me , " is both way too short and way too long a time to spend in the south . " " Graham Greene , " I said , " once wrote that the proper length of any visit is either two weeks or eighteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informant said . " If you 'd come here for just a fortnight , that would have been quite different ; knowing the end was in sight ? if you 'll pardon me ? we would have feted you with luncheons and parties . Down here , you see , there 's a kind of twenty-fiveyear trial period before we take in a stranger . Southerners do n't see the sense of investing all that emotion , all that risk , in people who tend to fly off in who knows what direction every other whipstitch . " There 's a sort of rule down here , " another southerner told me once , " that when you give a party you never let people talk together for more than three minutes , to keep things moving . Once a rather iconoclastic friend from New York was here for a party and got into three or four fairly promising conversations , only to have each one interrupted by his hostess , who would say David , I know you 'll want to meet so-and-so . ' So David finally got up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room and said , Goddamnit , we might as well play musical chairs ; you screw up every conversation I ever get into , ' which was really a stunning shock to everybody . " " Why , I have so many roots myself , " said an anthropologist in Georgia , " that I 'm almost oversupported . I used to have a beau who 'd address me as y'all ' even when we were alone in a room , so vivid was his sense of my tribe . " I heard a great deal about the strength of such tribes . I heard of a small boy in a town nearby who in fifteen minutes could ride his bicycle to the houses of both his two grandmothers and all four of his great-grandmothers , not a one of them a step-parent . I heard of a woman in her sixties , a grandmother herself , who went to see her parents , in their nineties , three times every week . " Their neighbors do n't think that 's nearly often // enough , " she said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ families are intense , all right . Four sisters and a brother , all unmarried and in their sixties , have spent their whole lives under the same one roof . A childless married couple in their fifties giggle conspiratorially about how late they like to stay up ? sometimes until well past midnight ! " Oh , we just have a high old time , " the wife said , " laughing and playing our records ! " Once she had given some thought to adopting a baby , since they could n't seem to have one of their own , but never got around to it . They did n't get around to it because her father ? not her husband , her father ? forbade them to . Just as well : a child in the house might give them less pleasant reasons to stay up so late . The man from the old New Orleans family never did take me to see the oil well by moonlight , that night fifteen years ago in San Antonio . He had meant to ; he had said we would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the airport . But instead we got to talking . This man wore a monogrammed shirt , the reason he had decided on the plane that he wanted to meet me , he said , was what I thought of as my Rachel Carson dress . I told him I had bought that dress to replace another , which I had burned . " You burned a dress ? " " Someone told me to ; someone told me the dress I was wearing was that awful . So I did . I stuffed it down a friend 's incinerator , and borrowed some clothes from the friend to wear home . " We sat in a hotel lobby that had an alligator tank , drinking bourbon . The man talked of his late father , who had said it was okay to be snobbish if one had a reason to , and of his wife , from whom he had been separated ten months now , and of his children . He would rather lose an eyeball , the man said as he tossed a crumpled wad of paper into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also talked of his mother . His mother was quite a talker . I ought to meet her . In time I did . Winter mornings can be cold in New Orleans . The oilman 's mother sat by the fire . It crackled . Her manservant brought her her usual breakfast : two fried eggs , two thin slices of whole wheat toast , coffee . The steam from her coffee rose in the sun that slanted onto the jewel-toned rug . When I came in to join her , she bade me have some coffee cake . I declined . " But you have to have some , " she said . " It 's Sara Lee , which the Duchess of Windsor said was the only good thing about America . " Oh well then , I said , succumbing to the cake and to her story . At // some point every year , she told me , the sun fell all the way over there to that corner of the room onto the pure white porcelain statue , the statue she had in her room in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , how starkly white it looked being unwrapped by blacker hands than I am used to seeing in the north . " Essentially , " she told me , " I was brought up by blacks . I have no recollection of my mother until I was six years old , and I do n't believe she ever cooked a dinner in her life until I was eleven . We had a housekeeper named Mrs. Green , who when she could n't think of anything else to clean up , gave us enemas . A psychiatrist once told me I had the worst possible background ; it was a wonder , he said , that I was n't locked up . " My family regarded themselves as the toniest kind of southern aristocracy . When my grandmother felt the call of nature , speaking of such unseemly matters , slaves would surround her and stretch out their skirts so no one could see what she was doing . That 's the kind of background I come from . Once , when a young woman failed to comment on a relative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew up , they led a pony upstairs in her house . Ponies , as you know , will go upstairs but not down . They had to take down the whole side of the house to get that pony down , on a ramp . " Men in such a culture do n't want wives . They want mothers . I married my first husband because I thought he 'd be depressed if I did n't . I thought , This is nice for him , he really likes it , it does n't bother me too much ; why not ? It was n't smart , but then I was n't raised to be smart . My mother could never forgive me for being Phi Beta Kappa . She would have preferred that I have an illegitimate child . " Most of the southern stories I heard concerned women . I heard of one lady who never opened a door in her life but always carried a black silk handkerchief with her , just in case she might have occasion to touch a doorknob . I heard of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because " I killed my husband to get him to earn the money to furnish this house , and I 'm not going to leave it . " I met many women with men 's or family names , a practice someone said arose after the Civil War , stemming from the fear that since so many men had died , the names might die too if they were not passed on to females . My ten southern weeks began just before what one woman called the " Green Rain ? the one rain we have every year that changes the whole look of things . " Change the look it did ; never again do I expect to see such azaleas , such dogwoods , such tulip trees and hickHURRY // ones . All these were splendid . So were the metaphors : " tight like a mule sphincter in fly season " and " mean as a boiled walrus . " So were the grits , the barbecued goat meat , the red clay , and the cafe where I heard that a widow once went alone to order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her late husband , one for her spiritual mentor , a Dr. Holman who had " gone to India to study altruism , " and one for herself . " She had kind of flipped , " a neighbor of this widow told me , " but of course we did n't admit it , because down here we protect our own , and she was one of our own , all right . " " Hurry back ! " the waitress said when I left that cafe ' myself . They said that everywhere in the south , the way they say " thank you much " ? giving " much " two syllables ? at cash registers in the midwest . I seldom felt much yen to hurry back to the south . Most of the people I grew to like there were also outsiders , who 'd come from Nebraska or Korea or New York . But there were exceptions . There were , for example , the Philpotts . You do n't use words like " nuclear " or " extended " when you talk of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to their credit , do n't talk or think that way at all . They talk in plain cadences that sound like questions , in an accent that to my Yankee ear made " aunt " sound like " ornt , " and " home " sound like " howm , " as in the sentence , " We 're having a reunion at Fairy Stone Creek to welcome home one of our aunts . " I went to that reunion . The Philpott who invited me was named Patrice . Patrice was nineteen that spring . I first met her on the campus of the Southern Seminary Junior College , in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains , a two-hour drive northwest of her home town of Bassett . " Sem , " as her college is called , had asked me for a two-day visit to talk with classes about writing , so I took a break from my ten-week visit to Georgia . My real reason for going was to listen , not to talk . Most of the students there were majoring in equitation ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I figured we would have refreshingly little in common . Patrice , a friendly , narrow-eyed blond girl , hung around after one class to talk not of horses but of her family , with such fervor that ten minutes convinced me she might be the most tribal young woman on either side of the Mississippi . " I 'd go home every weekend , if I had a car , " she said . " Once I went for five whole weeks without seeing my parents , and it nearly killed me . " Bassett , she told me , is in the white pine and tobacco country twenty miles north of the Carolina border . Her grandfather and his two brothers all lived within a quarter-mile radius of each other . Her father managed 1,1oo of the // 2,700 acres that had been in the family for six generations , since the first Philpotts came south from Maryland . Tradition had kept the Philpott clan strong for that whole time . " On the Fourth of July , " Patrice told me , " we always fry millions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It used to be that all my cousins would come , but now some of them are starting not to . We 're losing some of our sense of belonging . Now so many Philpotts , and others too , are moving out of Bassett that it 's hard to tell what 's going on . My grandfather 's children and his two brothers ' children all still live at home , but my cousins are starting to move away , which makes me right sad . It scares me to think that our family might not go on . In this past century we 've hardly changed at all , but what 's going to happen in the next fifty years ? " In grade school , " Patrice told me , " after I did n't make cheerleader , I dated the son of some mill people , who told him , Do n't you know there 's no sense your going out with a rich girl like her ? " But by most standards the Philpotts are n't rich . They make no pretense of belonging to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of whom have money . From what I could tell , the Philpotts were wealthy chiefly in their sense of tribe . " Once somebody came to one of our reunions and said that if he died and could come back as someone else he 'd want to come back as a Philpott , because the Philpotts have more fun , " said Patrice , " but he did n't know how much work goes into all that fun . We 're some hard-working people , we Philpotts . " Her father works at a lumber factory in addition to managing the land . Her mother has a job in an insurance office . As for Patrice herself , she had just " nearly killed myself over a term paper for Textiles that my roommate had the nerve to say I 'd plagiarized from hers . " Hard work : that is one of the Philpotts ' myths about themselves . Later I learned the other . Philpotts , I heard , have " never seen a stranger " ; they do n't sit back and wait for it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , preferring to go get it themselves ; they are hospitable , eschewing front doors in favor of the friendlier ones that lead straight into kitchens ; they believe that the hardest thing to open is a closed mind , and they help each other . If any bad fate should befall a Philpott , perish forbid , there 'd be no need to call for outside help , so quickly would other Philpotts swarm to the rescue . When Patrice said I ought to visit Bassett myself , as soon as I had a chance to , I felt as if a Rockefeller had told me which mat the key was under at Pocantico Hills . When my Georgia duties were done I made a point of stopping by in Bassett , just in time for the Fairy // Stone Park reunion . But I got there late . Kindly ladies with narrow eyes much like Patrice 's were wrapping what was left of their pies in foil , getting ready to carry them home . Granny , Patrice 's father 's mother , took my hand in hers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to meet such Philpotts and Prillamans and others as remained at the picnic , and to sense the spirit of those who had gone before . Most of those present scolded me gently for my tardy arrival , but assured me there would be other reunions . I believed them . It was quite plain that in a world of uncertainty and dread , one sure thing is that the Philpotts of Henry County can always come up with some reason or other , every few weeks or months , to stage another family reunion . " Jee-ma-nee , " the Philpotts said , " gol-lee , goodnight . If she 's come all this way to find out about us " ? they were talking about me ? " then we 'd better show her who we are . Let 's see , why are we so special ? Has she met A.L ? " A.L. , I learned , is Patrice 's father Charlie 's double-first cousin , and the Philpott clan 's hero . Every family , however humble , has its hero ? if not its lieutenant-governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ postmistress ? the one all the others work into their conversations as often and as proudly as they can . A. L. Philpott , Granny told me , " not only is in the General Assembly , he is the General Assembly . At the House of Delegates they used to tease him and say he had enough family to put down the opposition right there . He 's one of the most forceful , dynamic speakers you ever heard . Twice he was voted the most influential member of the legislature . He 's not in favor of the Equal Rights Amendment , because he thinks a lot of things are in there that if women understood better , they 'd be against it , too . " But Philpott women are not necessarily docile . Joanne , Patrice 's mother , would rather work as a licensed agent at an insurance office , " than stay home and make strawberry preserves , like someone said she ought to , " her daughter told me . " She says she 'd rather earn her own money to go out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about the E.R.A. to me . Instead he told me the history of Fairy Stone Park ? fairy stones , he said , are little rocks shaped like angels ' tears turned to crosses-and Philpott Dam Park , which was once on Philpott property , " then it went to the Feds , and was worked on by the C.C.C . and the W.P.A. The Confederate bills they paid for it never were redeemed . " A.L. , I heard , was the son of John , one of the three original brothers who settled these acres . " When those brothers dissolved the lumber-mercantile family business partnership , " Patrice 's Aunt Edna told me , " they did n't keep // but one account for all three . Only when they got married did they divide up all the accounts . When John took a contract to do something with the dam , they sent him a check for it and he divided it with the other two . Now that 's what I call loyalty . " The next afternoon we visited Aunt Edna . " Aunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and since all the fluid 's gathered around her heart , she has to lie down for an hour after every meal . " Aunt Edna is the widowed mother of Pewee , who lives way over on the hill . She received us regally . On her bedside table were Times to Remember and First Lady , and a family Bible , with a clip inside of a picture of Pat Nixon , with a penciled note : " Is n't this lovely ? " We also visited John 's widow , Aunt Gertrude , in whose living room photographs of the women in the family were framed in gold on one wall , facing wood-framed pictures of men across the room . Birdsong wakened me that morning in Patrice 's bedroom , which she had insisted on vacating for me . I woke between striped pink and lavender sheets , and beheld around me the artifacts of her life : a college beer mug , animal figurines with whimsical faces , Anya Seton 's Green Darkness , Norman Vincent Peale 's You Can If You Think You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Valentine candy box , electric curlers , a picture of a young man , a camp sign with her name burnt on it , stuffed ice cream cones , and posters captioned " LOVE CAN WARM THE LONELIEST PLACES " and " DO YOU LOVE ME OR DO YOU NOT ? YOU TOLD ME ONCE , BUT I FORGOT . " Breakfast that morning was creamed dried beef on the screened-in porch on Granny 's side of the house she shares with her son and his wife and their daughters . Creamed dried beef on the screened-in porch while the dew was still on the roses . One of the dew-covered roses was our centerpiece . Granny told of her church , the Primitive Baptists . " What we believe , " she said , " is that your destiny is determined before the foundation of the world . My father was a religious man who lived his belief by day . What he believed , and I do too , is that God foreknew what you would do and how you would live , and that we were all born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But if it 's all foreordained , " asked Patrice 's younger sister Jamie , " then what 's the point of trying ? " This question was not resolved that morning . Granny did agree that there were a lot of good people who had n't joined the Primitive Baptists , and that you do n't have to join a church to get to heaven . But her own baptism had been " the most wonderful thang on earth ? I was totally immersed in a creek in the middle of winter , and did n't feel one bit cold . " Strong faith , many think , makes strong families . A corollary exists // to link the decline of family with the decline of organized religion . The families I see most of on my own time tend toward the secular , but consider Cora Taylor , Otto Muller , and Papou Ngagoyeanis : can there ever have been families more tightly knit than theirs , or more intensely religious ? So too with the Philpotts , and a number of other cohesive southern families . Churches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agnostic divorcee I met who had moved to Atlanta from Minneapolis got so tired of having neighbors ask which was the church of her choice that she finally thought of a scheme to silence them . She and her children would get all dressed up of a Sunday morning in their best clothes , pull out of their driveway at half-past ten , return a couple of hours later , and never tell anybody that where they really had been for that whole time was at a Dunkin ' Donuts . Not so the Philpotts , or anyone else to speak of in Bassett , where the Baptists and Methodists compete for newcomers . " The Baptists were declining , " Patrice told me , " until Reverend Page , a new Billy Graham-type guy , came in two years ago . He 's so emotional I even got drug into it myself ? I went to a revival where everyone else was cryin ' and I got to cryin ' , too . I do feel like people have to go to church every noun then , even though I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a horse . " Patrice 's parents , her mother told me , are " both real active in the Methodist church . Charlie was on the board of trustees , president of Methodist Men , and taught Sunday school . I was treasurer of the Women 's Society of Christian Service , and on the Methodist Youth Fellowship . I do Scout volunteer work , too . Charlie comes along and helps me with that . He likes it better than getting involved in Kiwanis meetings and such . It does n't pay for both members of the family to get involved in community work , because if you do that , all you can hope is to meet each other coming and going , if you 're lucky . I keep pestering for the public schools ? been to every board meeting since January ? and I 've taught kindergarten and substituted in third grade , worked for the Census bureau measuring for bomb shelters ? that was pretty silly , now I look back on it ? and worked in an architecture office , too . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Patrice said . " When she came here in 1957 she had lived in bigger towns and even in Europe , and she still has some of her city ways . She 's still afraid of the animals , sometimes . " Joanne was married at age twenty to Charles Philpott , who , as Patrice said , " looks just the way he did in his V.P.I. graduation picture . He used to be in the mortgage business , but now he 's at the factory . He 's the most unprejudiced man I // ever met , and very observant , too . His job is to buy lumber from all over the U.S. , and he knows so much about the lumber business he can tell you all about whatever floor you may be standing on . He plays golf some , but he does n't go in for country clubs and that sort of thing . He 'd rather hunt or fish or talk to cows . " " You done shot your schedule up , " Charlie said to me , as my visit to Bassett @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " But she 's got to find out more about us , " said his daughter Laura . I wished I had at least a month to learn more about the Philpotts . Later that day they took me on a tour through the green-and-yellow landscape and wild daisies and ragged robins , back to Fairy Stone Creek and the old post office , past the factory , to a mill end shop to buy cheap sweatshirts , to visit a cousin who edited a newspaper , and to visit another whose daughter was soon to get married . That house was prosperous , with a lawn of Astroturf around its swimming pool , and a basement full of wedding presents , which were all to the bride 's taste except for a set of matching luggage . The going-away suitcases were n't quite the right shade of blue . I guess all the Philpotts will go away someday . I guess their sherbet-colored suitcases will bounce down conveyor belts in distant airports , unpacked in frantic and smelly places far from Henry County . I guess maybe this has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prospect , and I can see why Patrice is n't , either . Just before it was time for me to head north myself , I went for a walk in the family cemetery with her and her sisters Laura and Jamie ? Laura English Philpott , named for her mother 's people , and Susan Jamison Philpott , named for the paternal side . We walked among the tombstones , marked at the feet as well as at the heads , while horses named Sundance and Apple and Spirit cantered and neighed on the hillside above us , and locusts droned around us . " I feel sorry for only children , " Patrice had told me earlier , " because they have more troubles than those of us who were raised up in families . " I have always felt that way too , I told her . But the Philpott sisters , like my own and I , had their moments of discord . As the four of us walked over the bones of their Philpott forebears , Jamie unthinkingly broke a family rule , for which her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " they told her , " to stand on graves " ? a belief held in many times and places outside Bassett , Virginia . " To touch a tomb with his foot , even by chance , was an impious act , " Fustel de Coulanges writes in The Ancient City , " after which the guilty one was expected to pacify the dead and purify himself . " In Fire in the Lake , // Frances FitzGerald tells of an old Vietnamese man who resisted evacuation , asking , " If I leave , the graves of my ancestors , too , will become forest . How can I have the heart to leave ? " Mac had a lot to say about graves , too . Mac is a neighbor of my cousin Jenny 's , a short walk from the Gulf of Mexico in Mississippi . I hoped that we might swim in the Gulf the afternoon I spent with him and Jenny , but since he and she preferred the pool of his apartment complex , that was where we sat and swam and talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mac had two subjects he warmed to particularly : his work at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration , and families ? his own and everybody else 's . " I kind of think that one of the most fantastic things that ever happened to the south , " said Mac , " was being defeated , because defeat is what 's kept the clans intact . Your basic Scotch-Irish stock , with the exception of the French influence here in Cajun country , is what settled the South and most of the rest of this country , too , and that 's very clannish stock . The family , the clan , was everything , because in the wilderness it meant survival . " A man would leave his wife when he went off to war , and by God he 'd leave her with a gun , and if she had to be the protector , then she would be . That 's what happened with my grandmother . I want to know all I can about my own family . I 'm thirty-nine years old , and my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk to him . Sometimes when I 'm confused about something , I 'll say , Mother , what would Daddy have done ? ' I was born when he was forty . He was an old-fashioned man . He always said that if you saw something wrong and knew it was wrong and did n't do anything about it , you were as guilty as whoever did do it . He said to me once , Mac , when I die , I ai n't gon na leave you anything ? I ai n't got any money ? but we sure did have fun , did n't we ? If we wanted to go hunt and fish or swim , we went , did n't we ? I 'll tell you something , Mac , there ai n't no pockets in them shrouds . ' " The day my dad died I was the one went to the undertaker , because in Baptist families it 's the tradition to let the youngest pick the gravesite , the hymns , and the coffin . The undertaker said to me , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do n't we ? ' and I said to him , Oscar Lee , my daddy was a very plain man . ' The coffin Oscar Lee wanted to sell me cost $2,700 , but the simple gray steel one I liked was n't but $740 . My daddy died with just enough left for a tank of gas , but what a legacy ? me and my brothers , we went // through a great deal of hell-raising , but we had a great deal of love , too . " The older you grow , the more you come back to that sort of thing . The older you grow , the more you come back to the family . " Saying this , Mac jumped into the pool , breast-stroked two lengths , and climbed out . My cousin jenny asked him to join us at her house for a drink . Juleps , she had promised , for my sake . " I 'll be right over in ten minutes , " Mac said as he dried his head . " First I want to call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I talked with a mother of another little boy . She was disappointed in her son . But before she could tell me exactly how , she had to say what it had been like to be a child herself , thirty-some years earlier in a small town . As she talked , I sat spellbound : " I can remember the day my innocence was shattered , " she said . " I was fifteen , in an inner tube on a lake , when a jet suddenly and audibly screamed across the sky . I was offended , deeply . Before that , everything had been clear in the small town where I grew up . You knew what your status was , and everybody else knew too , but nobody dwelt on it . I had a closer association with black kids than with mill people . " Blacks are purer down where I grew up , " my hostess went on , " though crime in small towns is very bad and getting worse , and most of the criminals are black and young . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black nightclub over in the woods . My cousin , whom I grew up with , and I went out one day looking for that nightclub . He was from a large family that had a lot of money . Their house had real columns , not the cardboard kind . That meant real security . Everybody , blacks and whites too , knew our family . We could go anywhere around there and not be afraid . " My cousin and I had some idea of where that nightclub was , and we found it . It was called the Golden Goblet and it made me think of To Kill a Mockingbird ? going there was a real adventure . Late that Saturday afternoon my cousin and I parked our jeep in front of that place , held hands , told each other not to be afraid , and went into an enormous room , with silver gardenias everywhere and pictures of all the movie stars , a jukebox , a bar . We ordered Cokes . " The bartender knew who my cousin 's father was , and made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were . I ' 11 serve you the Cokes , ' the bartender said , but I do n't think you ought to stay here . ' Over in the corner was this absolutely stunning black girl , // with hair plaited just like Merle Oberon 's , wearing tons and tons of bracelets . I became intrigued with her and smiled at her . She smiled back . She was the first person I ever knew nothing about whom I felt , literally felt , from way across the room . I looked at her , in her elaborate dress , and wanted to touch her . She had a very soft voice , not thick like some black voices are . She noticed I 'd been watching her and could tell I did n't want to leave . I wanted to stay there and go ask her to tell me about life . " The man at the bar told my cousin and me to go , said he would n't tell our folks we 'd been there if we would just leave . We got in the jeep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . I turned around and looked at that girl for as long as I could , and she looked at me , and I silently prayed , Please , do n't let there be a curve in the road . And I said out loud , very loud , I 'm going to be just like you someday , ' and you know , for two or three years of my life , I was just like her . All my life there 've been split seconds when I 've felt that girl . " I never saw her again and did n't want to . I wanted her to remain an illusion . I had to tell my curiosity that it could n't go any further . She was eighteen or nineteen then with an innocent look , but I knew her ? maybe it was some soul-sister kind of subconscious understanding . She must have understood , too , otherwise she would n't have got up and walked toward the door to watch , as my cousin and I drove away . " That 's the kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is seeable , feelable , and I was hoping my son and his friend would realize that , when I took them down to the town where I came from , a few weeks ago . But they did everything so quickly ! They looked at the lake the same way they 'd look at a TV set . They did n't associate themselves with it at all . Nothing in our whole trip down there just overwhelmed or drew them , the way it had me when I was a child . Maybe that 's the trouble with watching so much television ? kids who watch it as much as all kids do now forget how many other ways there are to spend time ? if indeed they ever knew . Maybe it 's our fault , for not teaching them . " Me , every time I go down home , I just run to the lake , but for them there was no such abandon . It 's not just them , it 's their whole generation.They do n't even know what it means to think of freefalling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant when I told them to get out there , it holds you , it tells you , if you 'll listen . ' " My mother was a good spinner of tales . She 'd sit with a rifle in her lap ? she was a good shot ? and tell stories . But in the city now // these boys have no one , nothing like that . They have too much information , and no ability to forget what they 've learned and known . When I took them to the old grist mill and the old cemetery , they did n't even want to play hide-and-seek . I thought if I could run and leap around the lake and draw great big pictures in the sand so tiptoeing , always asking , Is it safe ? ' " They did n't even make big footprints the way I did , and if there 's one thing you should always do , it 's leave a trail behind you . I told them that . But they did n't listen . " These southern family arias nourished me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delivered in places and by people I would least have expected . Once I heard such an aria in a bar outside Athens , from a television crew member who just had finished filming part of a series on campus . He was about to pay for his drinks and leave when the word " family " was mentioned . He began to tell of his clan in western North Carolina . " Anyone of my generation could name every one of their great-great-grandfathers , " he said . " Now my people are scattered all the way from West Virginia to Florida , in search of work , and the clannishness is gone . Two great-uncles , who were twin brothers , got rich in Sarasota , so I guess now everybody 's middle-class . My mother lives now with a double first cousin in Sarasota , because Uncle Hugh and Uncle Lew went there in the Depression . Their sister , my Aunt Leona , had gone there first and established some roots . " But when I tell our kids we 're going home , they know I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves . I go back there even though it makes me very depressed to see what has happened , the way the topography has changed so drastically . I guess the North Carolina highway department did to us what we did to the Cherokees a hundred years earlier , when the Trail of Tears deed was written with a quill pen in 1836 . " In the middle of the 1950s came such a road-building mania , that my people got surveyed and paved flat out of existence . Now a huge four-lane road runs through that valley , and all that 's left is a church on the top of a hill , and the damn drag lines , scoops , and pans . Their road-building equipment is awesome , and what they use it for is awesome too ? to buy out the people and move them to the small towns , cities , wherever they 'll go . " My grandmother 's first cousin lived in a log cabin all his life , with no electricity . He 'd set there on the porch in the peak of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came through , tearing down that little house of his , he died within six months . My grandmother 's birthplace house is still standing , and so is her father 's , up in the hollows , but they 'll get to them sometime , too . Madisons , McAlisters , Snows , Couklins ? at least a dozen family names go back to these people . The total clan I 'm talking about had three or four hundred people , each of whom knew how he was related to all the others . " Any great-aunt or great-uncle of mine had the same authority over me that my own parents had . We all went to the Pine Valley Baptist Church . Aunt Jodie lived in a log house on the original site , the original 1830 log house , until she was in her eighties when she fell off a ladder . She fell off a ladder and broke her leg , and she would n't let the doctor remove her dress to set it . He had to cut her dress to do the leg . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever a stringed instrument was played in that church , the land would revert to the heirs , who now number something like five hundred . How we 'd divide it up , or how she 'd know , I ca n't say , but I known for sure that if it 's at all possible , I 'd like to be buried in that church graveyard where nearly everybody is my kin . " Those highway people committed cultural genocide . I 've got two uncles and half a dozen first cousins left there , but they 're all scattered in the mountains and hollows . The highway department killed my great-aunt , too . She threatened to shoot a bulldozer operator with a rifle , because she had an apple orchard the creek flowed through . They blasted rock in that ruined creek and said , We 're gon na have to cut a new creek bed , ' one that would flow through what was left of her apple orchard . They offered to compensate her , and the man very patronizingly asked , How 'll we get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way you got them in , ' she said . I do n't know what way that was , but you must know . ' She laid a 30-30 Winchester rifle across her lap as she sat there in her rocking chair and said , Go down and tell your men they may drive the bulldozer into my field if they want to , but they wo n't be driving it out . ' " They had to get a flatbed lowboy truck to haul a crane and go a hundred miles round-trip , picking the rocks up one by one . They did put them back where they were , too , like she wanted . She was eighty years old , my great-aunt was , and she said it did n't matter what happened to her because the bulldozer operators knew that she really would shoot them . " Those of my family who are left sit around of an evening talking // of remarks that were made , hell , seventy years ago . They do n't just tell of how in 1957 ? that was when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owned by my great-grandparents . They tell of Pete Conklin , a very peculiar man who never married , and how he had his hair cut once a year on the same day . He grew a long beard that always had flour and corn meal in it , and had a sack of corn and a sack of wheat and drank whiskey at the mill all day long . " At least a dozen houses there were owned by people I called Aunt or Uncle or some kind of cousin . These were all old people by the time I was ten or twelve ; then came my mother 's generation , then my own . They tell of a hound dog and a calf who sort of fell in love , named Trouble and Hard Times . They tell how Aunt Maude demanded to be baptized , at age seventy-plus , having decided she 'd go to hell if she was n't immersed in water . They lowered her into the water in her wheelchair , then she read the Bible one more time and came to the conclusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had two distant cousins , old ladies who lived with Uncle Jared , who died at the age of a hundred and three . He was a leather craftsman , mystic , and prophet . He 'd cure our warts . Once , so help me God , he took a wart off my elbow . Not until World War Two did these people have any communication with the outside world . I rode horses to the water-wheel mill and lived pretty much a nineteenth-century life myself , till I was almost in my teens . You see people now trying to rough it , ordering all these mock-rustic catalogues ? what they 're looking for is what we had ? a constant steady flow of spring water piped down through hollow logs and channeled into what was called a spring house . We had vineyards and ice-cold bulk butter and blackberries and strawberries and applesauce and smoked meat ? all the stuff my wife gets at the supermarket today , only a lot better . " My uncle 's been screwed every way you could imagine , " this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bar 's parking lot . " His land was paved , his river is polluted , his son came back from Vietnam in bad shape , his company laid him off , and now in his middle fifties , he 's out of work , diabetic and faced with the prospect of the government building a four-lane highway through his property . All our land of more than two thousand acres is now prime asphalt and gravel . " The families , the families just are n't there anymore . " // But I think he is wrong . I hope he is , anyway . Southern families may not be easy to locate or to connect with , but they still are there , and if they decide to reduce the 25-year trial period before they relax with strangers , then maybe those of us who pass through the south will fare better . I should like , on my own next visit , to meet people like an 84-year-old father I read about , who refers to his nationally distinguished 6i-year-old son as " the boy . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question I asked the social scientists at the conference : " Just what is it that makes a good family ? " The 7:40 A.M. ferry for Patchogue leaves Watch Hill in five minutes , and it 's clear I wo n't be on it . It 's clear I seem to need the sun and brine . I was n't even planning to stay overnight ; I thought I 'd catch the late boat after the soy-soaked mackerel , the squash melange and the brownies . But the others asked me to stay ; they said it would be good for me to get my mind off families . For a while it worked . For a while Dave and Sue and I played Scrabble , achieving nice words : ORBS , BALSAM , VIXEN , REAPING . But then we talked and what did we talk about ? What does anybody ever talk about ? Tom told how depressed he had been since the death a month ago of his much older brother . Now , at 51 , he is obliged to become his family 's patriarch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must assume , because his niece , in her thirties , asked him : " Will you be my father now ? " George tells of his parents : of his father who died when George was quite young , and of his mother and her sister , who both were aristocrats who married men they considered diamonds-in-the-rough . Each of the sisters had just one son . The boy cousins were raised as brothers until a seething feud developed between their mothers . The feud concerned an aged aunt whose most fundamental needs , rotated between the two sisters , were smelly and inconvenient . Each sister thought she did all the work . They stopped speaking . George and his cousin finally decided on their own that the feud was silly and need not concern them . When their mothers do n't know it , they get together . Their friendship has resumed . Loretta is still asleep on the other tiny narrow bed in the room she // and I share . She fidgets . She dreams perhaps of her older son Eric , who at age twenty-three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks he had been in a coma resulting from a motorcycle accident . Loretta and the nurses all despaired of Eric 's ever wakening at all , or regaining his intelligence , or speech , or motion , but the latest news was good : he had brushed his teeth ! Not only that , but when Loretta had looked down at Eric , after he woke from his coma , to ask if he knew who she was , he looked up at her and smiled . " I 'd say I knew you rather well , " he told her . And I came here to get away from talk of families . A Question of Scale Inherited wealth is a real handicap to happiness . It is as certain a death to ambition as cocaine is to morality . ? Willie K. Vanderbilt Superior worth is felt to inhere in blood which has been associated with many goods and great power . ?

Robert Coles The Privileged Ones IT 'S NOT EXACTLY a storefront church , St. Oswald 's . You do n't hear a lot of clapping and wailing from inside , nor are its parishioners much given to the taking up of serpents or the washing of one another 's feet . The charismatic revival , to date at least , has passed them by . Pew for pew , it would be hard to find in all the five boroughs of New York City a more elegant , privileged , and restrained congregation than this one . The faces at St. Oswald 's made me remember reading somewhere that a man 's education , like his nutrition , begins 250 years before he is born . Before I met the Druytens , I never had been to St. Oswald 's . I seldom go to church at all , much less on the East Side . I must fight being bigoted about the East Side the way some people are bigoted // about French Canadians . Three or four friends of mine live there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to lure them westward rather than visit in their part of town . Their part of town seems to me stuffy and pinched and intimidating . But generalizing is dangerous . One recent Friday , at a party on of all places Park Avenue , I met a roomful of people who despite their evident wealth were n't stuffy at all . They were lively talkers . Among them was a woman who declared she was " sick and tired of all the cliches about poor little rich kids , and how sinister privileged families are . " Some families with money , " she insisted , " are exemplary . They not only have brains and wealth and looks , but they 're magnificent people besides . " " I 'm on the lookout for families like that , " I said . " You ought to meet them , " she said . " All the wrong rich people get the attention . The ones who deserve acclaim shrink from it . The best family I know in this whole city is the one that minds publicity the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't tell you . They would n't want me to . Their motto is Those who talk most say least . ' Too bad , because if you did know them , you 'd see how ideal a family can be . " " But if they 're all that great , the world ought to know about them . " " It does , for the wrong reasons . " " Maybe I could tell the right reasons if I changed their name ? " " Maybe , " the woman said . She 'd see . Could I write a letter explaining what it was that interested me about families ? If I could drop such a letter off at her building the next morning , before she flew off for a fortnight in Rome , she would make sure that my letter reached her nameless friends . On Saturday I rose before daybreak to list in my letter some of the questions that had been on my mind : " What can shattered families learn from those that endure ? What stereotypes about families ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Can friendship replace kinship ? Should the terms clan ' and tribe ' be redefined ? How important to a family are ritual , myth , and religion ; sense of place , property , history and purpose ; elders , founders , networks of outsiders ? To what extent do adversity and guilt keep families to-gether ? " Sometime quite soon , " I said in concluding this letter , " I must decide on a privileged , intact , and somewhat prolific family interested enough in these same questions to let me pay it a few visits // within the next month . " With luck , such visits would not only let me sample the texture of privileged family life but teach me a few tricks about making sense out of a profusion of options . If I thought I had trouble with too many choices , how must it be for people like these ? On Sunday my telephone rang . " You do n't know me , " began the voice at the other end , " but I 'm Susan Druyten . " So ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Streets , dormitories , wings of hospitals were named for this family . I had seen the name on museum plaques and on the lists of symphony patrons . It had been a big name since the time of Nieuw Amsterdam . The first Druytens , I later read , came to this continent in the late 1600s , from the Netherlands , to buy and farm vast tracts of land . Some of this land had been sold by the original Druytens ' heirs ' sons ' heirs ' sons , to invest in tobacco . The name 's renown seemed to spring half from philanthropy and half from avarice . The family seemed to have two subspecies : the stewards and the squanderers . Just now the stewards were in the ascendant . Years had passed since any Druyten had caused a gossipy scandal . Stewards never make much news . Susan Druyten , she told me , was at work on her doctorate in abnormal psychology , so as to become a more informed trustee of two hospitals and two schools . Belden , her husband , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and now spent most of his time on a task force to improve the city school system . Celia , their eldest daughter , was halfway through medical school , newly married at age 25 to an orthopedic surgeon . Phyllis , a year younger than Celia , was n't really Susan 's daughter but her niece . She and Caroline , her younger sister , had been adopted when their parents and two brothers were killed in a plane crash . Phyllis had married a lobsterman in Rhode Island . Their life was arduous . They rose at five to tend to their pots and traps . Rachel , Phyllis 's age , was a librarian who lived in rural New Jersey with her ecologist husband . Gail was a senior at Beloit . Caroline , Phyllis 's sister , was in Madrid for her junior year abroad , on leave from Smith . Pamela was a freshman at Bowdoin and Helen in her junior year at Exeter . Belden 's and Susan 's nest was empty for the first time , but they were both so preoccupied with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and papers looming at graduate school , but my topic interested her . Families , her own and her husband 's and most others , seemed to fascinate her as much as they did me . Lunch Wednesday ? Lunch Wednesday , I agreed , and spent Monday and Tuesday // thinking about such rich families as I had known before , wondering what generalizations , if any , might be made about the way they raise children . There are rich families , of course , and rich families . There are Boston Irish patriarchs who give each of their children a million dollars , " so they can tell the world to go to hell . " There is feudal old money , and there are arrivistes who hire press agents to wangle debuts for their daughters . There are Houston oil couples who drive twin Rolls-Royces and say things like " We 've just had a keen idea for a trip ! What about a horse ride through Hungary ? " There are Boston stockbrokers who think it such a keen idea never to throw out old clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are Chicago orthodontists and Montana ranchers . There is a Delaware manufacturer who no more questions chartering a plane to fly his children to their New Hampshire ski house than I would question investing in an Add-A-Ride on a crosstown bus . Some rich families raise their children to pick up checks with what one clan I know calls the " dispenser mentality " ; others rarely carry cash . A millionaire 's wife I once knew in Ohio proudly wore " hand-me-ups " from her daughters . " Our children are much richer than we are , " she told me , " because my husband 's father never wanted me to have access to his mythical wealth . " Her husband 's mother never wanted his daughters to have summer jobs . " Nice people , " she told them , " do n't work . " I knew one rich family whose Fourth of July custom it was to spit watermelon seeds at one another across their Regency dining-room table , and another so timid they rarely said anything except in the passive voice . Instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would report that the knot had been tied . I used to know another man whose parents , word had it , " own half of Nebraska , and his wife 's people own most of what 's left . " That was n't too much of an exaggeration , apparently . In his bachelor days , before he turned thirty , this man had a brownstone building all his own in the East Seventies , and employed a live-in manservant to keep his shoes polished and to drive him around town . In his wallet was a picture of a baronial-looking house outside Omaha . " Can you imagine ? " he would ask , showing the snapshot . " We live in that ! " Another man I know used to take walks on the beach at Cape Cod with his dog . One day while he and the dog were walking on the beach , a teen-age boy jogged by them . The playful dog ran alongside the boy and took a playful nip at the boy 's leg , just above the ankle .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
