" You 're going to be recycled , " the short expansive man said , as he pointed proudly to a large poster telling the Red Lake Chippewas of northern Minnesota that Chief Leading Feather , " the next President of the United States , " would be on hand to dedicate the tribe 's handsome , new , red brick community center . Chief Leading Feather , known to the world as Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey did indeed come for the ceremonies and loved every minute of the repartee with chairman Roger Jourdain , who eagerly told a reporter that the last time Humphrey visited the tribe on its northern Minnesota reservation was in 1963 . That was the year they made him a chief , an honor that pleased HHH so much he danced with them for hours . The next year he became Vice President . Now , he was back to celebrate the Chippewas ' progress and next year , Jourdain said , he 'll be elected President . Humphrey did n't dispute his old friend ; in fact , he wants to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was his 1968 defeat by his old adversary , Richard Nixon . But life goes on and Humphrey 's yearning is n't as obsessive as it once was . Today he 'd settle for one more term in the US Senate , something Minnesotans will certainly give him next year . A week after Humphrey learned he is to be recycled , his 1968 running mate , Sen. Edmund S. Muskie , made his way up the midway of the Skowhegan State Fair in central Maine . He , too , is running for reelection . Unlike Humphrey , he may face a serious challenge in the person of the Republican Congressman William S. Cohen , one of the heroes of the Nixon impeachment hearings . Cohen is young ( just turned 35 ) and handsome ; he has a flat stomach and slim , often jean-clad hips . He 's a popular person , and polls show he 'd have a chance against Muskie . So Muskie 's advisers have told him that people in Maine feel out of touch with their senior senator and that he had better get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towered over the people who gathered around him . Would he run for President again ? No , he is running for the Senate . Fine , but they 'd still like to see him President . Maine treats Muskie with respect , as Minnesota treats Humphrey with affection , each a response to the essential character of the man . But how would either fare against President Ford or against ex-Gov . Ronald Reagan of California ? Whenever Democrats gather totalk about how to beat Ford the names Humphrey and Muskie crop up , particularly Humphrey . The two of them do better in polls than any one in the multi-candidate field of declared candidates campaigning around the country , trying to raise a few bucks , building organizations . Though both Humphrey and Muskie admit they 'd like the nomination , both are emphatic in saying they wo n't enter the primaries to win it . Nor does either nurse any unrealistic dreams of a brokered convention turning to him . They know it 's possible but use words such as " remote " to describe the prospect . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a great year for Humphrey , his best in a decade . He 's an " old New Dealer , " to use his words , a man who believes in a strong federal government , a planner who urgently favors setting national goals for the Gross National Product ( GNP ) , for thinning out the un ? employment lines , for building housing and for using tax and monetary policies to solve social problems . He returned to the Senate in 1970 , ready to resume his old goals only to find all his issues had been taken over by others during his six-year absence . That left him maladjusted until last January when he became chairman of the Joint Economic Committee . He plunged into his new work with the zest he 's famous for , taking what he calls " a super post-graduate course . " Humphrey found his target before he was a month into hearings ? Federal Reserve Board Chair ? man Arthur F. Burns and his secretive money policies . Hubert fretted out loud about the " magical , mystery subject " of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Treasury William Simon and Alan Greenspan , chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers , came before him . How could they set tax policy , wage-price policy , any kind of policy when they did n't know what Burns was up to ? It was like a three-legged stool , Humphrey insisted , only Burns had one leg in his pocket . If you sat on it , you 'd fall over . Humphrey joined as co-sponsor of a resolution requiring Burns to report quarterly to Congress on the Fed 's policies . It passed with ease , but Humphrey 's been around long enough to know a skirmish is n't the war . His super post-graduate course uncovered a trend that agitates Humphrey and , thanks to him , has become part of the Democrats ' campaign rhetoric : the steady rise in the " acceptable level " of unemployment . Humphrey , like other liberals , recalls fondly the Employment Act of 7946 . Then , a two percent unemployment rate was thought to be acceptable ; however , as recession has followed upon recession , tolerance has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven percent as " acceptable . " Every fiber of Humphrey 's being rejects the thought that millions of Americans should be permanently out of work . He knows how unpopular welfare has become , agrees that changes ( possibly a negative income tax ) are needed . But how ? Without planning , goals , a comprehensive federal jobs policy , he sees a bleak future . " These people ( the unemployed ) begin to feel there 's no place for them . They adopt a new life style , learn to live off welfare and food stamps , how to cut corners " ( his euphemism for crime ) . He worries about a permanent split in this country between " those who work and those who do not " and the deep hostility that would result . Nothing could highlight the contrast between Humphrey , the social activist , and Ford , the conser ? vative from Grand Rapids , more than the economic debate of the last year in which both played major roles . Unlike Humphrey , Ford was trapped in quite a different role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the minority leader . His job was to rally his troops to bushwhack one Democratic program after another , sniping away in a rearguard action against the more than 50 programs pushed through Congress during the days of the Great Society . it was n't a problem-solvingrole , and Ford is having just as much difficulty shifting gears as Humphrey would have . Meanwhile Muskie also took a new job ? the chair ? manship of the Senate Budget Committee , the new panel that grew out of the frustrations of the Demo ? cratic majority over the numbers game in which they were labelled big spenders ? unfairly , they insisted . The voters did n't know whose figures to believe . Then in 1974 a group of first-term congressmen demanded some " fiscal accountability . " Because of the trouble they were having convincing the voters , the leadership agreed to set up a new procedure whereby the Congress would develop its own budget , set its own spending figures and divide up the pie according to its own priorities . Muskie was named chairman . The timing could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year ago , there was a 70 percent chance ( he said ) that he would n't seek a fourth term . He was bored . He yearned for the quiet of a private law practice , perhaps in a small town such as Waterville , Maine , where he put up his shingle near the end of the Great Depression . He dreamed of long , carefree summers of golf at the family retreat in Ken nebunkport , where he could spend time with his family . He is n't temperamentally a legislator ; he i an administrator and his eyes sparkle when he talks about early budgetary victories he had as Maine 's first Democratic governor in decades . His new Senate duties have enough executive flavor to excite him and to keep him in the race for reelection . Under the new procedure , being tested this year , Congress sets a spending limit by May 15 ( $367 billion this year ) , divides it into the same 17 " functional " areas used by the White House and sends it to the regular legislative and appropriations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reconciled in the fall . Meanwhile , each time an authorization or an ap ? propriations bill comes to the Floor , Muskie , as chairman in the Senate , must take to the floor to tell his colleagues whether the figure is within the target set by Congress in the spring . In short , he 's been cast as the fiscal conscience of the Senate . Dealing with budgets , finding ways to make the money go a little further , setting reasonable goals and selling them , appeals to Muskie as an intellectual challenge . He insists on delving into the darkest corner of every issue confronting him until he 's certain he knows all there is to know . Once he 's studied a matter and made a decision , he 's not patient with dissent . His impatience with those who fail to see the logic of his carefully considered positions often explodes into anger , which has given him a reputation on the Hill for having a terrible temper . Aides say the charge always surprises Muskie ; it 's a " drawback " for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runs for President . Were Muskie to run against Ford , the voters might not readily grasp the difference between a Midwestern conservative who finds it difficult to renounce the comfortable status quo and a Yankee liberal who understands so well the way his constituents must scratch a living from the soil of his native state that he wants to make every penny count . Yet Muskie 's reputation as the fiscal conscience of the Senate might be just right for a public that perceives government is n't working . Humphrey 's image is quite different . His zest for planning alarms his critics ; indeed , they see him as a man ceaselessly , indiscriminately looking for new ways to spend the taxpayers ' money , extend the control of the feds into every aspect of people 's lives . In ? discriminate he can be ; that 's the other side of an undisciplined but generous spirit . He co-sponsors legions of bills . I asked an aide , how many this year ? She blushed , laughed just a little and said " a lot . " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name is inevitably on them . He ca n't stop talking once on a platform , sometimes driving a large part of the crowd away . After one such experience , a vexed aide asked Humphrey , who 's become a bit defensive about the chronic complaints that he 's long ? winded , why he did it . " Some men drink , some philander , I like to talk , " he snapped . There are serious questions in many minds whether Humphrey , in a time of huge deficits , a national debt that will probably approach $700 billion by election day , could say " no " to anyone . Ford , in contrast , has n't learned how to say " yes . " Muskie 's " maybe " might seem more appropriate . Humphrey 's self-image is quite different . He sees himself as a " man of ideas " who can articulate and implement them , a man who can coalesce public opinion by drawing a picture of where we are and where we should be , a man who could provide the political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he thinks a President should be ? a politician committed to prin ? ciples . As for government , he says " its purpose is n't to run everything but to see what 's here is run with justice . It has to be more than an umpire . Sometimes it has to set public standards . " He agrees government has lost touch , become " very big , slow to respond . " The more Humphrey thinks about it , the more he 'd like to be President . He 's aware of the talk . How could he fail to be , given the rousing , heartfelt ovation he received at the AFL-CIO convention in San Francisco , the reports that some of his most bitter critics of the Vietnam period are warming to him . But he wo n't run actively . The primaries are exhausting , debilitating and he does n't need them to create an identity . He was sick ( with cancer ) , but he 's apparently cured . The thing that holds him back is money . " I 'm sick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mingle with contributors and then being sent out while my people beg for money . Then , we found out people were giving corporate money without our knowledge . " Two of his trusted aides were caught up in it , one pleading guilty , the otherfound guilty . There 's talk of a " Watergate factor " in a Humphrey candidacy . But he knows financing would n't be a problem if he were nominated without an extensive pre-convention effort . The new campaign finance law allocates both major parties $20 million plus a cost-of-living hike ; the funds are in the kitty and would be disbursed as soon as he was certified . That 's the way Humphrey would like to run , free of the hassles of raising money ; free to raise , instead , the issues he thinks are so important . Muskie also knows the primaries are not the route to the presidency for him . He proved it once . He 's a proud , sensitive man possessed of Yankee reserve though his father was an immigrant Polish tailor . He ca n't bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oratory is n't natural for him and he 's embarrassed by what he perceives as the " hokey " in politics . Muskie 's memories of 1972 seem to center on the Florida primary , a dismal affair . His managers ruled that the combination of Florida 's loosely-structured politics and its huge media markets dictated a battle of what is known in that trade as " media events . " They were carefully staged , designed solely to get their man on the six o'clock news . For Muskie they were a disaster . " I 've never felt so unnatural , so disturbed as I was with the effort to put together media events , " he confides , going on to describe it as " like trying to paint a picture in 14 short brush strokes . We must have looked ridiculous . " For a candidate who had detailed position papers on almost every issue , papers that explored in depth the problems facing the country , it was a mockery of the process , not his style at all . Muskie would like to win the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a winning campaign as the party 's nominee . The odds do n't favor a scenario in which a Humphrey or a Muskie emerges as the nominee ; however , the chances are n't as remote as either pretends . If it 's to happen the primaries will have to be inconclusive . There is n't an issue to galvanize the well-organized , highly motivated cadres of the Democratic party 's liberal wing behind a single candidate as there was in 1972 , when they seized control of the party . Conse ? quently liberals are split , state-by-state , between three or four candidates . The solutions the candidates offer to the country 's economic problems differ more in accent and style than in content . Under these con ? ditions it 's possible voters will split so badly none of the candidates will emerge from the primaries with anything close to a front-runner status , except perhaps George Wallace . It 's conceivable that Wallace will arrive in New York next July with a third of the delegates , the remainder split hopelessly among a half dozen or more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start thinking seriously about what 's needed to defeat Ford and who could do it , someone perhaps like Humphrey or Muskie.
