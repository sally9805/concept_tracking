In the heart of every cop is one ideal he wo n't give up . It 's something he 's got to believe in , something no amount of contradictory evidence or polished alibis can beat out of him : There is no perfect crime . He 'll admit there are almost perfect crimes and almost perfect criminals  --  criminals so smart , so cunning that their work seems faultless . That 's the challenge of the game . The cop must feel he is a match for this near perfection . But William Archerd 's crime seemed perfect . Archerd committed murder and walked away from it . Not once . Not even just twice . But five times , frustrated police knew . They knew how he did it , how he knew to do it , even why he got away with it . Yet they could n't prove it , not with the solid , touchable , show-it-to-thejudge kind of evidence of which murder convictions are made . Then Archerd killed again . Late one November night in 1966 , he brought his seventh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had murdered wives four and five ) . Doctors were told she had gone into violent convulsions after taking the sedative Nembutal with whiskey . She was in a coma and died the next day . Attending physicians were baffled , but there was only one way to list her cause of death  --  hypoglycemia , shortage of blood sugar . The cause of death ? One of the greatest lifesavers medical science has ever discovered  --  insulin , the natural hormone which diabetics lack , the substance which controls the body 's digestion of sugar . Without insulin , a diabetic 's blood sugar level skyrockets , bringing on convulsions , then deep coma , then death . In a healthy body , there is the proper balance of insulin . Additional insulin upsets this balance , the level of blood sugar nosedives , followed by equally deadly convulsions , deep coma , and death . Archerd had learned about insulin as an attendant in the insulin shock ward of a California state mental hospital in the early forties . Insulin was used then much the same way electrical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illness . Archerd also knew that because insulin occurs naturally in the body , excess insulin was untraceable . What he forgot to take into account , the mistake that destroyed forever the perfection of his macabre murders , was that diabetes research did not stop when insulin was discovered . Medicine 's progress would stop Archerd and make medical and legal history with his conviction . One of fiction 's master detectives , Ellery Queen , once likened medical science to the science of detection . Crime was a cancer run wild on the social body , Queen observed . And just as the doctor-scientist must find the pattern of cancer in order to conquer it , so the detective must seek the pattern of crime : " Find the pattern and you are within shooting distance of the truth . " Ellery Queen is a Connecticut author named Manfred B. Lee . Mary Brinker Post , Archerd 's last wife and victim , was his sister-in-law . The man who discovered Archerd 's pattern and lined up the shot for the team of detectives , physicians , and assistant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is an unassuming veteran homicide detective , Lieutenant Harry Andre . The story begins July 25 , 1956 . It was a dull day for Lieutenant Andre , one he was spending at his desk in the Los Angeles County Sheriff 's office clearing up paper work . One of the papers was a report of a strange robbery and possible murder . The night before , a William Dale Archerd of suburban Covina reported a robbery . According to Archerd , two dark men armed with guns and hypodermic needles had broken into his home , taken $500 from him and his bride of four months , Zella , and , for some peculiar reason no one could explain , injected them both with an unknown drug . A physician called in to examine the victims noted two puncture marks in Mrs. Archerd 's buttocks . but , curiously , none in her husband 's . Robbery detectives took the information from Archerd , told him he could count himself lucky  --  the robbers had overlooked a substantial amount of jewelry in plain sight in the victims ' bedroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jewelry had already tipped them . This looked like an insurance hoax . Later that night , Zella Archerd went into convulsions , then coma . She was dead in twelve hours . Attending physicians now found four , not two , puncture marks in her buttocks . Lieutenant Andre went out to talk with the bereaved husband : " The guy 's story just did n't ring true , " he recalls . " He sure did n't look like a murderer . Handsome guy , wavy hair , big blue eyes that must have really set women 's hearts fluttering , but something struck me wrong . We did the usual workup  --  photos of the house , search of the area , and we found a half-empty bottle of insulin in a vacant lot next to the house and a big ( 20-gauge ) hypodermic needle in a bathroom drawer . " Andre took the insulin to a neighborhood pharmacist : " The druggist got out a big medical dictionary and we looked up insulin . It was right there in the book  --  the exact symptoms Zella @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his findings to the county coroner 's office and toxicologists ran tests , but found ? as they had expected no trace of the insulin . An overdose was suspected , but there were no tests available which would indicate excessive insulin in human tissues . And there had never been a murder charge alleging insulin poisoning in legal history . Zella Archerd 's death was listed officially as " bronchial pneumonia due to coma of an undetermined origin . " " I still have the receipt for that insulin from the coroner 's office . I kept it because that 's where we had to stop , " Lieutenant Andre says . " We did n't close the case . Something like that you keep worrying it and do n't lay it down or forget it . That 's why I kept that receipt . But we had squeezed the case ' til it was dry . " During the Archerds ' four-month marriage , Zella had transferred a great deal of money and property to her husband . Lieutenant Andre realized he had the motive . He already had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to trace the murder " weapon . " Nonetheless , he was onto the pattern . Lieutenant Andre 's memory was jogged two years later when he heard , over the police grapevine , that Archerd 's new wife , Juanita Plum Archerd , his fifth , had died in Las Vegas exactly two days after their wedding . Her death was blamed on an overdose of barbiturates , but it looked very much like insulin shock . Lieutenant Andre could take no action because the incident took place in another state , but he informed the local sheriff of his suspicion . The last he heard of Juanita 's death was that Nevada police had hit the same snag  --  no way to trace the insulin . Archerd 's name soon popped up again on the police grapevine . He and a friend , Frank Stewart , had flown to Las Vegas in March 1960 on what Archerd said was a combined business-pleasure trip . It was a strange friendship : Stewart was the ex-husband of Archerd 's sixth and then-current wife , Gladys . It was even stranger business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fake an accident and collect a handsome insurance settlement . Stewart had taken out a $62,000 flight policy naming ex-wife Gladys , now Mrs. Archerd VI , beneficiary , and another one for $18,000 making Archerd 's mother beneficiary . But what Stewart apparently failed to realize was that the policies paid only in case of his death or dismemberment . Stewart " slipped " on a banana peel in a rest room at Las Vegas ' McCarron Field , fell , and struck his head , according to the accident report . Actually , police would learn later , Stewart 's only " slip " was to allow Archerd to drop atropine in his eye and inject him with " a drug " to give him some of the symptoms of head injury . Atropine dilates the pupils . Stewart was rushed to the Southern Nevada Memorial Hospital . Following a visit the next day by the ever-solicitous Archerd , Stewartdied , true to the pattern which was now emerging  --  convulsions , coma , death . Doctors listed the death as accidental . Archerd collected nothing from Stew-art 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspicions and Archerd was too cautious to fight for the money . Yet even with the mounting tide of evidence against him , police still could not prove that insulin was the murder weapon or had even been the cause of any of the deaths . Archerd was as free as ever . One August morning a year later , Lieutenant Andre happened to be glancing through the Los Angeles Times as he ate his breakfast when he saw something that made him forget about food : A three-paragraph accident report described the death of a fifteen-year-old boy , reportedly the delayed result of a hit-and-run accident several days earlier . What startled Andre was the boy 's name  --  Bernie Kirk Archerd . He was survived by a grandmother and an uncle , William Dale Archerd . Andre called Lieutenant Harold White , the Homicide Bureau officer assigned to the youth 's case , and briefed him on the contents of what was by now becoming a thick file on Bernie 's " Uncle Bill . " Whiteand his partner , Sergeant Walter Thornton , began their probe into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For one , the attending physician at first thought Bernie had suffered a head injury in the accident . But tests of spinal fluid showed no red blood cells and no cranial bleeding  --  both of which could be expected to accompany a head injury severe enough to be fatal . The two detectives checked the hospital records . The boy had been brought to Long Beach Memorial Hospital by Archerd late in the afternoon of August 21 , 1961 . Bernie complained of a sore hip , tenderness of scalp , and dilation of one eye  --  all common injuries in automobile-pedestrian accidents . Yet there was no other evidence that any such accident occurred . Hospital records showed Bernie 's uncle had been a faithful visitor . One visit had been made at six p.m. , August 23 . That night Bernie , whose condition had not been considered critical , suddenly lapsed into a coma . Despite emergency cranial surgery , he died nine days later without regaining consciousness . Lieutenant White and his partner confided their suspicions to Bernie 's neurosurgeon . The doctor told them that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Bernie 's death had been caused from an overdose of insulin . He based this on the results of several spinal sugar tests . But , of course , there was no way to prove it , he added . Investigators also learned that Bernie 's father had died only a few months before . Archerd and Archerd 's elderly mother , Bernie 's grandmother , were executors of a $7000 trust fund for the boy 's care . Here , again , the pattern repeated . Here , again , there was the motive  --  money . Bernie was the fourth victim linked to Archerd . Agents were so convinced of the smooth-talking widower 's guilt they presented their case to the Los Angeles district attorney 's office . But under the cold objectivity of legal examination  --  stripped of circumstantial evidence , coincidence , and personal feelings  --  police again had to admit there was n't enough admissible evidence to prosecute . Deputy DA Joe Carr tried desperately to add muscle to the case against Archerd . He held conferences with the county 's chief medical examiner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confirmed there was no method of extracting insulin from tissue or blood  --  no way to find the murder weapon . Even if a technique for isolating insulin was available , doctors told Carr , it could not be used to prove the cause of Bernie 's death , for the boy lived nine days after being injected . The insulin by that time Continued on page 108 would have dissipated due to the large amount of glucose he received intravenously . Totally frustrated , the investigators conceded defeat . They knew their case would never hold up in court . The killer 's identity and whereabouts were known , as was the growing list of his victims . Yet police were helpless . They could only stand aside . In effect , Archerd had a license to kill . Lieutenant White had done all that was professionally possible : now he did one additional thing which he felt was the only human thing to do . He told Archerd 's current wife of police suspicions . Gladys was a middle-aged woman of means , as Zella and Juanita had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I wanted to warn her , " White recalls . " She went right to Archerd and told him what I said . But I think , despite the fact that they had a good laugh over it , that knowledge may have saved her life . When he asked her for a divorce she did n't argue , " he says . The Archerd case was n't closed , by any means , just snagged on that one missing clue ? proof of the cause of death . Every conjecture or possible lead detectives Andre , White , and Thornton came up with they dictated for inclusion in the file  --  a thick , blue-bound loose-leaf notebook held together with brass brads . White often took that notebook out and thumbed through it , looking for some previously overlooked clues , He checked and rechecked names and acquaintances . In the five years between Bernie Archerd 's death and the death of Mary Brinker Post , investigators interviewed more than 500 persons . One of them was Rosey , a sailor 's wife , who had been Archerd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rosey told us Archerd almost got caught injecting the old man and had to ditch the paraphernalia , and he asked her to buy a new set of needles , syringe , and insulin , " Lieutenant White says . White also uncovered three similar deaths among Archerd 's friends . But he was unable to get pathologists to speculate about insulin shock as the cause of those deaths . " They all pooh-poohed our theories . They were physicians ; we were detectives . What did we know ? It was a long time before we could get people even thinking along our lines . " When Mrs. Archerd the seventh , Mary Brinker Post , died , Lieutenant White knew the pattern so well he could almost quote it from memory : She allegedly suffered head injuries in a traffic accident . Following her " accident , " Archerd stayed with her to " console " her . Shortly afterward she went into convulsions  --  supposedly from taking the sedative with whiskey . He rushed her to the hospital , but she was in deep coma by the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detective Marty Deior were assigned to the case full time now . They were joined by Raymond J. Daniels , Jr. , of the district 's attorney 's office , a former medical student and an expert on medical-legal cases , Together , they pored over medical journals and textbooks describing new research on insulin , hypoglycemia , and other pertinent subjects . Their first break came when they were referred to Edward Arquilla , M.D. , Ph.D. , professor of pathology at the UCLA Medical Center , one of the leading experts on insulin . He agreed to assist . Doctor Arquilla was one of the few persons in the United States then capable of performing a radioimmunoassay on human blood . From such an examination of Bernie Archerd 's brain tissue he concluded that Bernie had suffered brain damage of a type most probably caused by " massive doses of long-acting insulin administered eight to ten days prior to his death . " Lieutenant White checked his notes . Archerd visited his nephew in the hospital on August 23 , 1961 . Bernie died ten days later , September @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of circum stantial evidence that tied Archerd to six victims , including Archerd 's friend William E. Jones , who had died in Fontana , California , Hospital in 1947 . With the professional testimony of Doctor Arquilla , the district attorney 's office finally believed it had a salable package . They presented the case to the grand jury , alleging three counts of murder in Los Angeles County and three similar acts in other jurisdictions . They had decided to take the chance  --  to try to prove the cause of death , even though they could only theorize about the murder weapon . They still could not isolate the insulin which they were certain had killed all six victims . Over the next several weeks investigators relocated and reinterviewed more than 500 witnesses . Family doctors , nurses , attending physicians , pathologists , toxicologists , experts in insulin shock treatment , specialists in diabetes , relatives , hank officials , insurance company representatives , and Archerd 's living ex-wives . All agreed to testify . More than 130 were called before the Los Angeles County grand jury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 27 , 1967 , Archerd was indicted on three counts of first degree murder . Archerd waived his right to a jury , deciding to take his chances with one man- Judge Adolph Alexander . Proceedings got under way December 4 , 1967 , in a dramatic trial that would make medical and legal history . The prosecution began laying a solid groundwork - proving Archerd 's technical expertise with h insulin . Dr. Grace F. Thomas , well-known psychiatrist and expert in insulin shock therapy , was called to the witness stand . She told how Archerd had learned about insulin while employed as a male nurse at the Camarillo State Hospital in California from 1939 to 1941 . At that time , Doctor Thomas was in charge of the hospital 's insulin shock ward . A co-worker of Archerd 's at Camarillo State testified that he had injected her and others with small doses of insulin so that they could learn firsthand the early symptoms of insulin shock . Robert Tranquada , M.D. , professor of internal medicine at the University of Southern California School of Medicine , was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence about diabetes and problems related to the endocrine system . Both Doctors Thomas and Tranquada were given copies of all existing hospital records of the victims . Doctor Tranquada personally interviewed relatives and close friends to establish the victims ' prior medical histories . Both doctors testified that each victim showed definite symptoms of having been given massive doses of insulin . Then came a witness that cinched the circumstantial case ? Archerd 's third wife , Dorothea , a registered nurse . Yes , she testified , Archerd was very interested in insulin . He even borrowed medical textbooks on the subject from the hospital where they both worked . She and her ex-husband also shared an interest in murder mysteries , she added , and often had discussed writing a mystery story where insulin was used to commit the " perfect murder . " But , she concentrated . Doctor Arquilla injected one group of mice with the fluid from the victim 's brain tissue , and injected another group of mice with fluid taken from the test patient . All of the mice had been diabetic and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In the two or three months of the trial before l took the witness stand we kept repeating the tests to he sure , " Doctor Arquilla recalls . " About a week before I took the stand I felt we had sufficient reproducihility  --  we came up with the same results each time and the controls on the experiment were unchallengeable . I felt confident , but I was n't sure yet just how it would go on the stand . " No one at the trial was more testified , Archerd had divorced her for Zella before they got around to writing the book . The judge was later to remark that Dorothea 's testimony had been one of the most damning moments in the trial . The " plot " for the would-be mystery thriller had been the exact plan Archerd had followed for all six victims . A parade of detectives and sheriff 's deputies methodically placed Archerd at the scene near the time of death of each of the six vi ctims , starting twenty years before with the death of William Edward Jones and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's death in 1966 . There was no possible scientific explanation of the six horribly " coincidental " deaths but insulin shock , witness after witness explained . Still , the prosecution knew all too well that the evidence presented so far , as binding as it appeared , was built upon the shakiest of legal foundations  --  circumstance . A rcherd realized this and seemed confident . He even seemed to enjoy the reputation that press coverage was creating for him . And when one reporter asked how he 'd managed to be such a " lady-killer , " Archerd quipped , " his china-blue eyes twinkling , ' Unfortunately , I 'm a lot of fun . ' " But Ray Daniels had decided to gamble . The day the trial began , UCLA Pathologist Arquilla had been given a jar containing the brain , liver , heart , and lung tissues of Mary Brinker Post . Behind locked doors at his university laboratory , he started an intensive research project , hoping to find a way to determine insulin content in the tissues . It was a complicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measured by radioimmunoassay . A similar assay was performed with brain tissue from a patient about the same age as Mary Brinker Post . The extracted fluid from both brain tissues was anxious about how Doctor Arquilla would testify than detectives White and Andre , and Ray Daniels . White and Andre , who had first connected insulin shock with the case of Zella Archerd 's death , had worked eleven years to bring Ar cherd to trial . White had logged thousands of man-hours on the case , both on and off the job . Convicting Archerd had become an obsession . Daniels , too , was nervous and apprehensive . He knew if Doctor Arquilla 's tests were inconclusive , years of careful preparation would be wiped out . And Daniels did n't know how conclusive Doctor Arquilla 's crucial tests were . Calmly , the pathologist explained to the judge the meticulous detail of his research project . He described how he had extracted and measured insulin from the brain tissues of Mary Brinker Post and from a " control " patient and how he had injected two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " There was no medical precedent for what l knew , " Doctor Arquilla recalls . " I felt the tests could be described in such a way as to overwhelmingly prove the circumstantial evidence . I had planned to bring out the lab results only as an ancillary proof . " in cross-examination the defense lawyer was uncommonly severe , and his questions were loaded with disparagement for Doctor Arquilla and the other physician witnesses , Then came the " re-cross " - a second questioning from Ray Daniels . The tension that had built up between the doctor and the defense attorney had left the court room hushed . Spectators were aware that the doctor had been about to say something important when the defense attorney had cut him off . The look in Doctor Arquilla 's eyes tipped off Daniels and Lieutenant White , who by now knew their man well : The doctor was going to clinch the ease . The lab results were conclusive , Doctor Arquilla testified . The diabetic mice injected with the extract from Mary Brinker Post 's brain reacted exactly as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level went down at more than twice the rate of the diabetic mice injected with the extract from the test patient . Both the biological assay ( the mice test ) and the radioimmunoassay proved conclusively that Mary Brinker Post 's brain contained markedly elevated insulin levels . Then came the words that nailed the killer . Doctor Arquilla testified that his test results , along with the well-documented low blood sugar and low spinal sugar of Archerd 's seventh wife , could only be explained by a massive dosage of exogenous insulin administered the night she went into a coma , the night Archerd and only Archerd had visited his wife , the night before he brought her to the hospital . Here , at last , was the un-shakable proof . After thirty-six days of trial , William Dale Archerd , now Continued on page 126 continued from page 110 fifty-six , was found guilty of three counts of first degree murder , and was subsequently sentenced to die in the gas chamber at San Quentin . Ironically , Archerd never profited from the six known murders he committed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money , but in almost every instance , he had failed . Where is Archerd now ? He is part of the general prison population at San Quention . He escaped the death sentence when it was abolished . Where are Andre and White ? Applying their same methodical detectives ' expertise to other murder cases assigned to the L.A. County Sheriff 's Homicide bureau . " Our only claim to fame is Archerd , " Andre says . And Doctor Arquilla ? He 's chairman of the Department of Pathology at the California College of Medicine , University of California at Irvine . More importantly , he 's still involved in research on diabetes . " I get upset at all the notoriety the Archerd case caused , " he says . " I 've done a lot of good work in the field of diabetes and insulin , and I could give you a spiel on how little support diabetes research gets . I think it 's the most important disease in the country . I think it 's a far more important killer than Archerd. " 1970 Today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hitter .
