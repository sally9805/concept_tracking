The people who help us , we 're grateful to them , but I wish they would n't keep on telling us how sorry they are for us , how bad we have it . And I wish their eyes would n't pop out every time they see we 're not crying all day long and running wild or something . The other day a white fellow , he said how wonderful my home is , and how good we get along together , and how impressed he was by it all . I wanted to say , ' Do n't be giving us that kind of compliment , because it shows on you what you do n't know about us . ' <P> - Mississippi black man <P> to Psychiatrist Robert Coles <P> ACROSS the U.S. , there are 25 million impoverished , deprived and misunderstood Americans , black and white , who like that Mississippian are generally scorned , patronized and looked upon as psychologically sick and morally deficient . Yet to Harvard Child Psychiatrist Robert Coles , who knows these forgotten citizens-and their children-far better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After more than a decade of studying and living with sharecroppers , migrants , mountaineers , poor blacks and working-class whites , Coles has concluded that most are astonishingly healthy in mind and remarkably courageous in spirit . He believes that they possess unrecognized strengths that , if properly understood , bode well for the future of the nation . <P> In a passionate effort to get that message across to an America beset with more suffering and social unrest than at any time since the Great Depression , Coles has in the past dozen years poured his insights into 13 books and 350 articles .

They are part of a multi-volume work called Children of Crisis , a long-term study that began in 1967 with a book about the effects of Southern integration and will continue in 1975 with a report to be called Chicanos , Eskimos and Indians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 42 , as the most influential living psychiatrist in the U.S. Black Psychologist Kenneth Clark says that Coles ' quiet presence on the national scene " keeps morality , decency and justice alive . " Leon Eisenberg , director of psychiatry at Massachusetts General Hospital , believes that Coles ' work is an " effective prod to the social conscience of other psychiatrists . " <P> Coles ' accomplishments are perhaps best summarized by Harvard Social Scientist David Riesman : " There is one important theme he has contributed : antistereotype . Policemen are not pigs , white Southerners are not rednecks , and blacks are not all suffering in exotic misery . What he is saying is ' People are more complicated , more varied , more interesting , have more resiliency and more survivability than you might think . I listen to them ! You listen to them ! Please listen ! Again and again ! ' " <P> By rising above the set prejudices of both liberals and conservatives , Coles helps depolarize a divided society . He has performed one of the most difficult and important feats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , to lament the nation 's weakness-es-its " greedy , monopolistic , avaricious and sordid sides " - while continuing to cherish its
