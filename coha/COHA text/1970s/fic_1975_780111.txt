 | Cleveland heaved himself up and closed the door of his small office . It had only the desk in it , a pigeon-hole file , a couple of chairs and an obsolete Oliver typewriter in addition to the desk 's accumulation . From just outside came the measured thump of a job press . Cleveland pulled open a drawer of the desk , took out a pint bottle of whiskey and drank from its mouth . Afterwards , seating himself , he asked , " Care for a bracer ? " " Thanks . No . " " Not recommended for Bright 's disease , not by old Doc Crabtree , but nothing is , so what the hell ? " " Hard to come by ? " Ben asked . " Whiskey ? In Montana ? Boy , you do n't know the state . We voted Prohibition for others , not us . Federal agents come here from afar to get a good drink .

" " Now about selling the paper ? " " Times are hard enough without giving up booze , " Cleveland went on , perhaps to put words between himself and the issue , perhaps to indulge himself in old man 's talk . " The ranchers are broke . Wheat ranchers , livestock men , all broke . Wall Street 's on the up , I see , but that does n't mean shit in short-grass country . You a Republican ? " " Nominally . " " Better so , if you want the county printing . " " That means you 're ready to talk business ? " Cleveland belched , wiped his mustache and waved the subject away .

Not politicians , either , they are n't , and not particular friends of mine , but they 're what Kipling said . " " Interesting . People I 'll want to know . Provided ? " " And another time , " the old man continued , " I wrote an editorial ? that was in about 1920 , hard times ? and I captioned my piece , Nothing Was Ever Lost by Enduring Faith in Montana .

I worked , part-time , as a two-thirder in a composing room while getting it . " " Good . Your old-time country editor was an educated man . When he retired , he sold to his faithful printer , who did n't know a pluperfect from a passenger pigeon . Sorry state of affairs .

The job press still beat its measure in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the track , Ben thought , until he said , " So you got to be a booster . Success springs from the manure pile , though who am I to say so , not being rich ? Still and all , I 've made out in my years here . Before that I owned a weekly across the mountains . No go with those apple-knockers . Took me a long time to learn the secret of success . " He smiled a smile with no mirth in it . " A young fellow  | like you brings a high mind to publishing . After a while he learns the first duty of a newspaper is to make money . " " Are you trying to discourage me ? " Ben asked . " Remember , I love this state . I have , ever since as a kid I hopped bells in Yellowstone Park . " " Belles with an e ? " Cleveland said . The question did n't deserve a reply . " Great state for hunting and fishing , not to mention scenery , " Cleveland went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " All that . That and the youth of the country . " " Youth ? " Cleveland said and let the question lie in him . " Youth ? " It was as if he were trying to summon his early years , to recall the old drive and dreams dusted over by years . Then , abruptly , dismissing the attempt , he asked , " What 's your proposi-tion ? " " What 's yours ? " " I do n't remember suggesting one . " " All right . I can put ten thousand dollars , cash , down . The rest would depend on an examination of the books , inventory , appraisal of equipment . " Cleveland made a little movement with his cigar , and ash fell on his vest . " Ten thousand ? So much ? So much for a young man ? " " I saved every cent I could in the army . " " Saw service , huh ? What rank ? " " Captain , and I saw more than enough service . " " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No . " He knew his tone was abrupt , but who , knowing them , wanted to talk about death and guts and stink and fear ? " I saved my money , as I said . I had some to begin with , earned as a journeyman printer in Ohio before I volunteered . Then , after the war , with government help I took a few courses at Harvard and in my spare time worked at my trade . " Ben stopped . Why did he feel he had to explain to this sad old wreck of a man ? " You would fit in , " Cleveland said . ' " Phis town is shot in the  | ass with patriotism . Sees bolshevikis everywhere . You a member of the American Legion ? " " No . " " Better be . It 's strong here . Pine-tree patriots , meaning they served their time at Camp Lewis or somewhere west and never got within moon length of a Hun . No matter . They 're true-blue Americans and damn the First Amendment . " Cleveland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No offense ? " " Not particularly . " " I 've been wanting to say that for a long time , " he said , his eyes still on Ben . " I guess I can speak out now . " " If you sell . " Spoken , the words seemed regrettably cynical . " Declaration of independence , huh ? " Cleveland answered without heat . He picked up the bottle and took his third drink . " Still say no ? " he asked afterwards . Ben regarded the bottle and the old mouth that had sucked on it . The mouth said , " I got a glass somewhere . " Cleveland shuffled his desk papers and found it . " A short one , then . " Cleveland poured a stout drink , and Ben raised his glass and said , " To a sale ? " " Hold it , " Cleveland answered and drank from the bottle and added , " I must give thought to the matter . " But , going out into the bright sunshine of July , breathing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seeing the high sky kind and allencompassing , Ben felt sure he had bought himself a weekly newspaper .  | AFTER BEN TATE HAD GONE , Cleveland sat in his chair and let the minutes drift by . All right and goodbye , he would sell to this young fellow . How often in these skimpy days did any man come up with ten thousand dollars in cash ? Having sold , he would go to California or someplace and get out of the wind and the cold and the pitiless , dry days of July and August . Get out of them ? But cold had been his companion and the wind a good enemy , and on sun-struck days a man able-bodied could laze along a trout stream and let the fool world go by . He would miss the seasons , though more and more they tended to merge in his mind . Spring , summer , fall , winter , spring ? they slid into one another , became a stream that carried a man along , forgetful of the changed waters . Yet , sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind of the chinook , and his eye loved the first dandelion . Cleveland looked at the bottle on his desk . There was still a heel in it , and he drank it . In the time of youth a shot or two or three did things for a man . They brought to flower a spirit in which the sap already ran strong . They opened it to the full sun of promise , and its answer to that sure light was unmixed jubilation . Not so anymore . Old bastards drank so as to ignore and forget , to harden the hide against the slings and arrows of regret and the damn general sameness of day by day and year by year . They drank against the withered hope , hastening , if they knew that much , the arrival of the coffin , which would take them even earlier if they had Bright 's disease . The job press ceased thumping , and footsteps sounded , and  | Cleveland slipped the empty bottle into his desk drawer . Just as well not to invite that look of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Oscar Knapp , if anyone cared . " I could still get those dodgers run off , " Myers said . " Never mind . Time to knock off . " " There 's some orders piled up . " " I know , but never mind . We 'll get to them . " As if doubtful , Myers turned around to go out . " Leave the door open , " Cleveland said . " I 'll stay on a few minutes . " Okay Myers , the faithful printer , the upright , reliable temperance man , who always pushed to get the Advocate published on time . As if time were of the essence , as it ought to be in the newspaper business . Okay , who was Catholic and had eight dull kids and so had uckfayed himself close to the wolf . Okay , who nevertheless could probably raise a down payment on his reputation alone and by rights should be sold the business . By rights ? Okay an editor ? Ask him about Cicero , and he would be likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there in himself still , Cleveland wondered , some clinging vision of what a newspaper could and should be . A reporter of all the news , and let the chips fly ? An informed and literate organ ? A molder of opinion ? A community influence , a good one ? Save on exceptional days , days of stray sparks , he had n't been an editor himself but only a printer of chitchat and advertising . He could have spoken out against the Ku Kluxers , that bunch of bigots who had seduced some good men but at last appeared to be losing their drive . Right now he could editorialize about evolution , the Scopes trial and the true-believing monkey minds who walked with God . He could inveigh against Prohibition , that failure foredoomed at the outset , that noble-minded , simple-minded Verboten endorsed by old ladies , anxious parents , reformed drunks , and men who feared that one honest jolt would unbutton their pants . And the Red scare , the Red hunt , fueled by that lunatic patriot , Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Montana , as most crazes did . Full  | force because the tail-ender thought it was still a part of the parade . He had dodged and was dodging subjects like these and would do so again , given the option . Out of timidity ? No . Out of expedience ? Yes , in degree . Out of fatigue or more likely laziness ? Take your choice . It had come to be that almost nothing was important enough to justify effort , let alone controversy . He heard the outer door open and called out , " Come in . " By the limp of the footsteps he knew his visitor was Billie Gayle , who moved in a shuffle and had difficulty directing his hands . A birth injury , rumor had it . Billie ran the Arfive Club , where a man could buy tobacco , cigars , cigarettes , near beer and pop , or engage in a small game at one of the two tables in the rear . " Well , hello , Billie , " Cleveland said , knowing his tone was cordial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the desk . His mouth smiled a smile that his maimed face would hardly allow . " I thought I 'd pay my bill , " he said . " No hurry , Billie , " Cleveland answered . " I never worry about you . Billie tried his crooked smile again . " But I do . " He got his hand inside his pocket and brought out three silver dollars , some smaller coins and the crumpled charge statement . The cash must have amounted to half a day 's take , maybe more . Cleveland counted out the amount owed and receipted the bill . Taking money from a cripple and an uncomplaining one at that ! He listened to the halting step and half-step of Billie 's exit and wished he had a drink . Not one drink , he thought , but enough drinks to be comfortable . What did it matter ? Earlier , when he realized he was on the downgrade , he had wondered whether booze was being his undoing . Or had the decline of purpose led to the booze ? Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both ? But why wonder now ? It was too late to find a newer world and smite the sounding furrows with Ulysses . Ile was about to get up when the front door opened again and  | Peter Sears entered the office at Cleveland 's greeting . Peter ran the town 's principal and almost only department store and so , of course , was often called Roebuck . " What 's on your mind , Peter ? " Cleveland asked . " Just hair , and it 's disappearing . " It was , all right , though Peter was young and spoke in the strong tones of youth . " Have a seat . " " just on my way home , but I wondered ? well , I guess you know the Bureau of Reclamation and maybe the Army Engineers are taking a look at the Breast River , thinking to dam it at the mouth of the canyon ? " " Routine , " Cleveland answered . " Long way off . They 're looking at every river in the country . But why in hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Oh . Sorry . I have n't even had time to open the mail . First I knew , an engineer visited the store this morning . " " Call him a scout . " " You know , though , Mack , it could be a great thing . Lots of land to be irrigated that ca n't be dry-farmed worth peanuts . " " There are other dams , on the Medicine , for instance , and settlers have had to scrabble . " " But they 'll make it . It 's hard times for everyone now . And think of the business the dam crews would mean . " " No doubt about that . " " I was thinking a little newspaper promotion would help . Might hurry things up . It would get people interested and in back of the Bureau . " There was a question in the words , and for an instant Cleveland was tempted to say he was selling out . Instead , he answered , " It 's a long , long way off . But , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the town and county ? Time 's ripe , I will . " Peter said , " Sure , Mack . I know . We all do , " and rose and walked out . Before he reached the front door , he was humming sonic tune that was probably popular . For a moment there sounded in Cleveland 's ears the old voices singing , the young voices sure of themselves , now silenced or  | reduced to the cackle of dotty ancients who crippled from county rest home to post office , if they could make it that far . For a fact , they were all dead or deadened , the old , young friends , the old , good times , the singing that said dreams come true . And he did n't care . That was the thing . He was n't able to care . The town was not his town anymore , the world not his world , life not his life . " This , too , shall pass away , " someone , maybe Lincoln , had said , ignoring the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troubles referred to . And age could n't bring itself to feel or to care . The final subtraction before death itself . He got up then . He could go home and listen to the squawk of his Radiola . He could go to Billie 's Arfive Club and play pinochle . But first he would have a drink or a dozen . He would go to the drugstore , where Spence Green would fix him up with a prescription and bottle , thanks for the prescription to old Doc Crabtree , who left his booze pad at the store and would n't charge anything . Good old Doc Crabtree . The bottle secured , he would go to the Club , not Billie 's , where men with time on their hands , as well as some with none , went to talk and to smoke over drinks . All right , then , go , he told himself , and went to the door and locked it behind him . For a moment he looked to the west , where the sun played fire on the late-afternoon clouds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realized he had forgotten his dog , who liked to lie by the window in the shop and let the sun warm his old bones , but only when Cleveland was close by . Cleveland let the dog out , who gave thanks with one tail wag , and looked at the run-down building in which he had spent his years . The building would n't miss him . Neither would Okay Myers . Neither would anybody except for one goddamn old dog .  | EMERGING FROM the odors of printer 's ink , newspaper and job stock , cigar smoke and the whiskey he could n't smell after having a drink , Ben Tate considered a casual stroll , casual droppings-in on the storekeepers and shopkeepers who would be his advertisers when and if the paper was his . He had met a few of them already , more or less by accident as he reconnoitered the town . All right , it could be called a one-gut town , counting only the business places ? stores and shops , two banks , two hotels , commercial garages , abstract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some others . Not too many of any , but enough for a going newspaper energetically managed . Standing on the walk , he looked toward the west , toward a sunset such as a man did n't see in the East . The clouds flamed behind the purple humps and spires of the Rockies . They rested like sea vessels , in shades and hues and brilliances not known to rainbows or dictionaries . Behind them the sun showed only a part of its face , like an eye drooping toward sleep . Whenever he walked , undetermined as to direction , Thoreau had written , his feet always took him west and southwest . And that was good enough . West he had come , Ben thought , and west the would remain , and now let his feet march him to a clearer view of one of the reasons he 'd found . After half a mile he was out of the town . He came to a wire fence and bent through it and halted in a field given over to coarse grass and low brush and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the bag , her head lifted , her eyes patient and curious , perhaps wondering whether he had come to ease the strain on her udder . He sat down on a bald hummock and gazed at the clouds , at the  | harsh lift of the mountains , at the sun close to sleep now . At either side of him , far off , the valley lifted into benchlands , bright yellow in the last sun but hare and unshadowed as yet . Closer , in front of him , meandering to left and to right , the trees of the Breast River bordered its shores . The cow had gone back to grazing . There were words for this land and these sights , empty and editorial words , words like space and peace and freedom and majesty . He tried them on his tongue , seeking better ones , and felt a tide running in him . He was awake and asleep both and in both states alive , in both aware and receptive to the far and close presences of sky , cloud , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a house built to order ? he could think of them now . At twenty-eight he could think of them . A girl faithful and lovely and tenderly eager , a girl distilled pure from all the women he 'd known or imagined . For a moment he lay with her , his hand admiring her contours ? and felt a swelling in his trousers and got up abruptly and brushed himself off . " First things first , " he said aloud and saw the cow gazing at him . The sun had gone down when he got back to town , but the long light lingered . It was time and past time to eat , and he decided to forego the indifferent fare of the Arfive House and try the food at the cafe called Eva Fox 's . A woman in unspotted white welcomed him and showed him to a table . At this late hour there were few customers , none of whom he had met . The woman took his sailor straw hat and glanced at his Oxford-bag trousers and coat and made him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business and professional people , most of whom wore full suits , with ties , men hereabouts dressed in jeans or plain pants , open shirts and vests not covered by coats . For headgear they preferred western hats made of felt . The woman handed him a menu and waited and said without other comment , " What may I bring you , stranger ? " Before lie could make up his mind , a man entered and called out , " How , F , va . "  | She said , " Mort ! " and left Ben . " Long time no see . How 's the family ? " " Fine but out gallivanting . No time for a saddle tramp . " She made quite a business of seating him . He was a man of perhaps fifty-five , maybe more , though he bore himself with an easy confidence that belied age . He had the wind and the West in his face , Ben thought , and he wore the clothes of a stockman . His cowpuncher heels clumped as he went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " he asked after seating himself . " Got a good steak , Eva ? " " Did I ever let you down ? " " No , ma'am . Scald me one then . " She came over to Ben . " Sorry . Now , what will you have ? " " The same as your friend . " " Fine , " she said , seeming to hesitate , as if perhaps he 'd asked what was reserved for the few , or the one only . She disappeared and came back , bringing water . Mort ? The name dodged around in his head , and on impulse he asked , low-voiced , " Would that be Mr. Ewing ? " Her head lifted , and she looked toward the man , smiling , and called to him , " Mort , there 's a stranger here knows you . " The man 's eyes examined Ben briefly . They were not unfriendly . " That 's sure a horse on me , " he said and rose and came toward Ben 's table . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " I hate to graze alone . " " Of course . Please sit down . " Seated , the man said , " Seems you know my name . Mort Ewing . " " I 've heard it mentioned . " Ewing was silent . " Oh , sorry . I 'm Ben Tate . " He felt his hand grasped by one that was rougher , maybe tougher , than his . " Easy brand to remember , " Ewing said . " Not in full , " Ben answered , wondering why , in the presence of this strange man , he felt inclined to say more . " I was christened Benjaunin Aswell Tate . " " Quite a handle , " Ewing said . The over-all smile came again ,  | the smile that was more than politeness . His eyes , responding to it , appeared to see near and far both , as if beyond detail he looked into distance . Sun had darkened his face and wind left its marks on it . Life had been good to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be good and found fun in the doing . " I 'm not out on the town much , " Ewing said after a pause . " Do n't hanker to be . " He was silent again , and Ben suspected a question had been put , though unasked . " I 'm just drifting around , I guess you could say , " he answered to it . " And I guess you could say I 'm from Ohio . Born there , anyway , in a little town known as Leesburg . " " So , " Ewing said as if that matter were settled . " Most of us came here from someplace . Except for some young bucks just feelin ' their oats and the small fry , of course , we 're shy on native stock . Live here twenty years and you 're an old-timer . " In looks the man rated as an old-timer doubled . He might have been born in the open and exposed to the sculpturing western weather on his first day of life . And yet he was set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was clean and better in quality than common run . His boots had a shine . His vest had seen cleanser and iron . The woman brought them each a steak , a baked potato , a dish of corn and a radish salad in some kind of dressing and , for their common use , a basket of hot rolls . Ewing asked for black coffee , and Ben ordered the same . The food was excellent , far better than he had been served elsewhere in the West , where , Ben judged from experience , the best steak available had been cut from some scrawny cow . The rolls were delicious , and the salad had a sweet bite . They ate in silence . For an old cowboy type ? and surely he was that ? Ewing had uncommon good manners at table , good enough for Ben 's mother if only he wore a coat . After dessert Ewing said as he fashioned a cigarette , " Kind of dull here for you , I reckon . Nights , anyhow . " " I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out a thin plume of smoke .  | " Yeah . I feel sorry for them that do n't read . Where you puttin ' up ? " " Right now at the Arfive House . " " Used to be a good bar there , before Prohibition turned it into a rot-gut restaurant . " Ewing considered . " Course , there 's always the picture show but generally so full of shot and shell and men dead and dyin ' , you wonder there was anyone left to settle the West . " " They 're true to the outside impression , the movies , I mean . " " And about as close to true as instant salvation of sinners . " A suggestion seemed to come and be debated in Ewing 's eyes before he spoke again . " The stranger , the Book says , is a man to be taken in . Say so if you do n't , but you want to come with me to the Club ? " " Well , thanks , Mr. Ewing , but I do n't like ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street . Some of the boys drift there , and we can have a drink if that do n't run against your current . " " It does n't . Sure , then , and thanks again . " The Club was a basement room in one of the only two two-story buildings in town . Scattered in it were a dozen or so chairs and three round tables with decks of cards on them . A row of lockers flanked one end , close to a shelf lined with glasses above a water basin . There were only two men in the Club now , one a stranger to Ben , the other Macalester Cleveland , who lifted a hand in a tired salute from a far corner of the room . " Sit down , " Ewing said . " We got two drinks here , straight bourbon and bourbon with ditch water . Which ? " " About half and half . " Ewing went to the lockers , opened one , mixed two drinks and brought them to the table . " How , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drank with him . Ewing studied the bright toe of one boot , lifted as he sat with crossed legs . " I did n't know I was so famous , bein ' named to a tourist . "  | There was the unput question again . " I said you were mentioned . I do n't really feel free to tell you the circumstances . But your name came up and that of ? let 's see ? Collingsworth . " " Prof , you mean . One hell of a good man . My friend , even if we do n't always track the same trail . " " I was just inquiring around , thinking I might stay for a while . " Ewing said , " So . " There were clatters on the steps , and voices , and three young men came in , yelling greetings as they made for the lockers . " Long time between drinks , " one said , and another answered , " A long fifteen minutes . " They fixed drinks , took their bottles and went to sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept sizing Ben up . In this setting he felt conspicuous and a trifle ridiculous , felt like a show-off in trousers so baggy that one leg was roomy enough for both of his own . On the eastern seaboard they had been quite the thing . More footsteps sounded , and more voices descended with them , and two more young men came in , followed by an older one evidently not of their party . The older one waited while the others got drinks and , bantering , went to join those already seated . Then , methodically , he prepared his own mixture and came to sit with Ewing and Ben uninvited . Ewing said , " How , Doc ? How 's the weather with you ? " " Unchanged , same as usual . " " Meet Benjamin Aswell Tate . " Ewing 's eyes showed a quick glint of amusement , no doubt at this proof of unexpected remembrance . " Doctor Crabtree , Ben . " They shook hands . Doctor Crabtree might have been put together with long scraps of left-over lumber , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was lean and hard , as if shaped and forged by felt suffering . Ewing listened to the noise from the other table and presently said above it , " Good intentions always get kicked in the ass . " " What did you expect ? " Crabtree asked , as if knowing without explanation to what Ewing referred .  | " My idea was to have a club for us old and lonesome stags , like you and Mack Cleveland for instance , where we could have a quiet drink and quiet talk and a quiet game if the notion hit us . " " This is what you got . What you might have expected . " " What 's to do for lonesome old bucks ? " Ewing appeared to sigh , noiseless in the noise . " Drop in at the barbershop . Visit Billie Gayle 's . In good weather laze on the street , hopin ' to strike up a conversation . Go to the post office and not get any mail . Anything to put between themselves and the boneyard and nothing to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for old bulls . " He had to speak louder . " Not this , though I got nothing against youth except it 's so young . " Crabtree turned to Ben . " Mort 's not so lonesome and not so sour as he 's saying . He could shut up the club right now . Hell , he owns the whole goddamn building and leaves this room open for free . " Cleveland had heaved himself out of his chair and with stiff care was pouring himself another drink . Behind the chair a grizzled dog lay watching . Now , as Ben 's table fell silent , a hard voice rose at the other and word by word won attention . " So it was just a scare , huh ? A Red scare , they call it . A scare , my ass . " The speaker had an intent , unlined face , as if truth had ironed out every wrinkle . " I tell you these shit bolshevikis are everywhere . Right here to find in this town if you look . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A grin turned up one corner of his mouth . " And me you . That 's the ticket . No one to trust , savin ' yourself . " For the moment the speaker seemed to have exhausted his steam , or to be overwhelmed by the extent of his knowledge . He looked at his hands , held still on the table , as if picking and choosing what next to say while awaiting energy appropriate to it . The men around him were slow to pick up their idled talk . They passed a bottle and studied Ben , not quite openly except for one nian who stared at him . He was a big man with a big face that suggested it had been plowed , and he appeared close to drunk .  | Mere curiosity , not suspicion of his being subversive , Ben thought . He was an outlander in an outlandish outfit . He could wish he were behind the table and not at the side , where his clothing was in open sight . " Sacco and Vanzetti , if that 's their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The speaker had made his choice and found fresh strength . " Still alive , those dirty bastards , found guilty but still alive . And what does that prove ? It proves weak minds and foreign influence . If loyal Americans had had their way , they 'd have been strung up the minute the jury reported , if not before . " The big man with the plowed face said , " We 're with you , Earl , one hundred percent , but me , I got to mosey on home or get throwed out to the dog . My woman can lecture even fiercer than you . The man left his chair , made toward the door , caught sight of Ben again and halted before him . " I do say , " he said , " those are the goddamndest pants ever I saw . Goin ' to buy a couple of wool sacks and have a pair for myself . " He waited for an answer and went on , " Big enough in one leg for me and my old lady and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if the silence had diverted his train of thought , asked abruptly , " You a member of the American Legion ? " His eyes began to show a dull animosity . Ben did n't reply . " Not an ex-serviceman , huh ? " To the unasked questions of Ewing , he had felt obliged to reply . To these blunt questions , no . He knew he could get up and assume the old pose of authority , could voice the old tones of command and so , by such cheap dramatics , and subsequent explanations , put himself in good grace . He could fight the man . He kept still . The room was still , too . " A goddamn dodger , I bet . " " Get some air , Brobeck . " Ewing was speaking , soft-voiced but all the more effective for that . His thumb jerked toward the door . " Go cool off and come back mindin ' your manners . It 's my friend you arc tryin ' to rag . "  | The man opened his mouth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others followed . As they filed by , Ewing said , " Not to say you 're not welcome , boys . " One of them answered , " We know , Mort , but it was one of our party went wrong . Sorry . " When they had gone , Ben said , " My fault , I guess . It 's hard to know how to act . But he was just drunk . He did n't have a mean face . " " No , not Brobeck , " Ewing answered . " He 's not mean . " He reflected and added , " Not that one . " Mack Cleveland scraped back his chair , got up with effort and came to the table , watching each step . " A buck private , " he said , his mustache fanning to his breath . " That 's all he ever was ? no , a buck private busted from sergeant and never moved back . " He put one hand on Ewing 's shoulder and leaned close for emphasis . " Do you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more overseas service than all that bunch put together ? " The man was enlarging on what Ben had told him . " No , " Ewing said , " but I know when a man knows enough to keep a tight rein . Ben here could have taken him , too , or I 'm way off the mark . " With one hand on Ewing 's shoulder and the other one pointing , Cleveland said , " It could be you 'll see a lot of this young fellow . " A quick speculation showed in Ewing 's face . He answered , " I would n't object . " " Good enough . " Cleveland turned toward the corner in which he 'd been sitting and called out , " Here , Bluster , " before he found the old dog at heel . They went out slowly , old man and old dog , one as stiff in step as the other , if not for the same reasons .  | Jacta alea est , ' meaning the die is cast , if you know your Latin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signs and seals , legalisms and lawyers do n't bind the deal , let 's shake hands on it and have a drink by way of hello and goodbye . " They were in the Advocate office again , and again the time was afternoon . Ben took the extended hand . " It 's my bounden duty , as they used to say , to take you around and get you acquainted , but , hell , duty is the cargo of the weak vessel . " " There 's no need for that , " Ben said . " I 'll put out the goodbye issue this Thursday and introduce you in it , but the word 's in the wind already . " A smile touched the mouth under the shag of mustache . " Reminds me of the time ? I was just a kid ? I wrote , Lawyer Murchy moved from where he was to where he is now on Tuesday , ' and even that much did n't need to he printed . " Cleveland pushed himself back from the desk and felt for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mustache and rose and fell low in his chest . The veins of his nose were like trickles from the flow of his heart . " But damme , boy , I forgot . Out of character , too . " He pulled a drawer open and took out a pint bottle from which a nip or two had already been drunk . He poured into two clean glasses on his desk , which had been put into some kind of order , but seemed in no hurry to drink . He studied his whiskey . Studying it , he drew on his unlighted cigar , then hit the end off . " You know the sources , " he said then and went on as if visiting  | them one by one in his mind . " Courthouse , of course . Deeds and transfers . Suits filed . Marriage licenses . Court when it sits . County agent will give out hot news like how to bait gophers with the new batch of poison he 's mixed . Sheriff s office . Once in a while , to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tastes are n't , he knocks off a still or chases booze run in from Canada . Undertaker , the end of the train but no small caboose . " Ben said , " I know . " " Mayor 's office , " Cleveland continued as if uninterrupted . " Forest Service , which puts out fires and then sells off the trees that it 's saved . But most of them come to me with the news . " He lighted his cigar and blew out a puff of remembering smoke . " I got a high-school kid meets the train for local items , distributes leads and slugs and melts , skims and molds Linotype metal in off hours besides covering school news and sports . He 's not much , but here 's his name . " Cleveland scribbled on a pad and passed the sheet over . As Ben nodded his thanks , he went on . " You can save a lot of wear and tear , such as covering local concerts and plays and Chautauqua and such boons to culture by enlisting local talent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work just so they can say they wrote this or that . And a by-line ! Good God , for a by-line they would investigate hell . Want their names ? " " Later I may ask you for them . " Now Cleveland drank , not as a toast , and , with his glass drained , poured another . He sat slumped and quiet as if waiting for a flame to rise from the embers . As he took the cigar from his mouth , his worn eyes rolled up to Ben . " You 're in no hurry ? " " None at all , Mr. Cleveland . " " You can go if you want or waste time with my prattle . Sin of old age , son , prattle is . A man with age on him maybe thinks if be twitters he can stave off the end . Or maybe the old fool thinks years give importance to ignorance . But it 's all just mewling and puking , thanks to Shakespeare . " Ash dropped unnoticed on Cleveland 's open vest . Ben 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sighed . " But I tell you , Ben , when the string is run out , a man wonders . Here I 'm thinking now about where to go , where on God 's earth to go . Used to be , right up to the time we made our deal , I swore I 'd get out of here before the next winter came . Yeah , sunshine and no wind and maybe the seashore , and an old man can still look at pretty girls , remembering . " One hand closed in a loose fist , as if it would strike at something not clearly seen . " But , damn it , I 'm grounded in this country , snubbed up and hog-tied , and blind , you might say , to other suns and other skies . A by-God Eskimo homesick away from his ice house . " The little-rivered eyes looked into distance , and the old words slowed . " The country gets into a man . " Cleveland paused , like a writer hunting for the right phrases to type . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calm days will be better for it . He shivers in the cold , and part of that shiver is the shiver of summer to come . " Again the stop-to-think pause . Again the man at the typewriter , fingers waiting on brain . " He looks to the mountains , blue-cold and bleak as on the first and last days . " The fingers of his voice went idle , then busied themselves . " He looks to the hills from whence cometh , not the biblical help , but the seen float of distance and the sense of endurance . Cleveland broke off and said abruptly , " Shit and goddamn ! " Ben did n't speak at once . When he did , it was to say , " Thank you . " Humph . Whiskey talking . " Cleveland finished his drink and seemed to debate about pouring another . His side lost , for the moment at least . " You said I must meet two men , " Ben said , not as a change of subject but as the beginning of a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mort Ewing and Prof Collingsworth . You 've already met Ewing . " " And liked him . " " I do n't know just why I sicced you onto those two Wien .  | They 're not what you could call close friends or good customers . " Cleveland spoke again after reflection . " Well , candor compels me to state ? that 's my editorial style coming out ? that they have stood and still stand for something . " Now Cleveland poured himself another drink and replenished Ben 's glass . His voice was suddenly harsh . " They stood for something , goddamn it ! Stand for something . You understand ? " " Not entirely . " Cleveland straightened in his chair . He seemed to bristle . " Not that I have any regrets , " he said with what Ben took to be aged defiance . " Not one goddamn stinking regret . " He raised his glass . " And now , young man , the deal is done . Drink up , and so long . "  | OUTSIDE , Ben @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was false-fronted ? Were n't most of the buildings in town ? So the paint was peeling , and even the Advocate sign , once black on white , suggested no more than a gray advocacy . So the windows were dirty , and the concrete step-up from sidewalk to door crumbled at either corner . No matter . It was his , all his , though subject to a mortgage that time and hard work would pay off . All his , do or do n't , make or break . His perfect if imperfect baby . Yes , sir , that 's my baby ? the song sang itself ? No , sir , do n't mean maybe . . . He could see part of himself reflected in the one big , dirty window . No Oxford bags now , but the conservative trousers of a suit just bought at Shannon 's Men 's Wear , an advertiser . His sailor straw hat would have to be accepted as a small eccentricity . As he was about to go on , a dusty pickup pulled up at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be the big man with the plowed face . Brobeck , Ewing had called him . The deep ruts of his face went wide with a smile . " Cap'n , " he said , " I 'm beggin ' pardon for the other night . I had you all wrong . Care to shake my paw ? " Ben shook it . " It was them big as by-Jesus britches . Them and the whiskey I 'd drunk . " " It 's all right . " Ben was returning the smile . " Not without I own up . Drunk in the privy , and I fell through the hole . Get caught shifty , I say , and the only soap is excuse me all to hell . " " You 're excused . I 'm glad to know you . "  | " Brobeck 's the name , hitched onto Frank . Frank Brobeck . " " Ben Tate , " Ben answered , taking the hand again , " and in case you or your friends wondered , I 'm not a foreign agent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Cap'n . It was the pants sidetracked me . Earl Kilmer ? he 's a lawyer ? it 's him and a couple of others dream Red , just maybe with some footin ' in fact . But the rest of us men in the Legion , we do n't pay ' em much mind . It ai n't often , even , we go to meetin 's . Let them three , them three officers , see the country is safe . " " What 's wrong with that ? " Ben said . On this closer look , the man 's face showed that the plow had cut furrows of open good nature in it . " Me , workin ' on the roads for the county , I got my own dirt to dig . " Brobeck 's eyes went from Ben to the shop and back to Ben again . " Hope you 're goin ' to be around for a while , " he said as if knowing the answer . " Right now I 've got to shove off . " " First , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sure . I went to school to him for a while , and it ai n't his fault if it did n't take , I do n't care what anyone says . Just head out on lain Street , " he said , pointing . " In about half a mile or less ou 'll see it , a pretty big house , white , to your left . " After Brobeck had gone on , Ben crossed the street to his Hupmobile , parked in front of the Arfive House . Four o'clock , an hour suitable enough for a call if the call itself suited sense . He sat iii the car for a while . The two-story house stood behind a flanking of cottonwoods . Back of it , at the side , an open garage covered a Ford touring car , the like of which was not being produced anymore . In the looping turnabout that the drive made , a new Reo was parked . Company , then , and too late , once he 'd turned in , to beat a retreat . Across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkened by screening as to veil easy sight , though Ben sensed presences in it . Ile tapped on the door . It opened , and a man said , " Good afternoon . " He was a man of square build , not tall , and straight in the shoulders . The hair  | was whitening , brushed to the side above a face that was square , too , and dusky rather than sallow . Ben noted this much as he said , " Good afternoon . My name is Ben Tate . You are Professor Collingsworth ? " " Yes ? " From behind Collingsworth a voice called , " How , Ben . " " Come in , wo n't you ? " Collingsworth offered his hand . Mort Ewing rose from a two-seat swing suspended by chains from the ceiling and shook hands . On the porch were three chairs , two easy , one straight , and all worn . As they were seating themselves , Ewing said , " Prof , I aimed to tell you about Ben before my mind went off chaiin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want to work the full handle , it 's Benjamin Aswell Tate . " His eyes were amused . Inside the house , turned low , a Victrola was playing . " Born in Ohio , " Ewing went on . " That 's about all I know for a fact , but not all I might swing a loop at . Eh , Ben ? " Collingsworth 's expression was questioning . Ben said , " I guess it ca n't hurt to tell now , since the rumor 's around and everything is agreed on . I am buying the Arfive Advocate , to take effect the first of the week . " " Oh , " Collingsworth answered and nodded as if in endorsement . " That 's one of the reasons I 'm here . " " I doubt I understand . " " Mr. Cleveland told me I must meet you . He said you and Mr. Ewing were the head and the hoof and the haunch and the hump of Arfive , if I remember correctly . " " How 's that for top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in regard to Kipling at any rate , " Collingsworth said . Of a sudden he smiled an incredulous smile . It transformed him , making sunny an expression that had seemed habitually sober . " Cleveland said that ! Cleveland did ? " " He did . " " Mort , you never know , do you ? " The music from inside came to an end , and a girl appeared in  | the doorway , a woman perhaps in her mid-twenties , but a girl for all that . " Come out , Mary Jess , " Collingsworth told her . " Mr. Tate , Mary Jess , my daughter . " The girl nodded gravely and said in a voice meant for singing but muted , " How do you do , Mr. Tate ? " She stepped to a chair and sat down . In her movements was that sure economy known as grace . Her hair was coiled at the back of her head , up and away from a brow that had room for thought . It would have dismayed an up-to-date girl , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knee , to show a waistline where the waist was , or to leave even a modest suggestion of bust . Her eyes were brown , or , in better light , possibly hazel-green . ' I hat music you were playing ? " Ben said . " It 's an old , old song , Whispering Hope . ' " " I know , yet I always thought of it as a , well , as a sort of last wail of hope , as a kind of sticky despair . But those voices ! " " Alma Cluck and Louise Homer , " Mary Jess said . Her words came out softly but finally , not to be added to , their meaning contained by simplicity ; and it struck Ben , looking at her , that here bight be a girl of patient containment , of containment that pahence made pitiful . " The head and the hoof , " Collingsworth was saying . " Would that imply wisdom ? " He did n't expect an answer . " Like Thoreau , I wonder if the wisest man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lw " But lac did himself , or seems to have thought so , " Ben anrrcd . Collingsworth cast him a quick glance , as if admitting a surpris eflg addition to his measure . " Yes , Mr. Tate , but he warned by that he added . He wrote that in thirty years he had not heard the first syllable of valuable or even earnest advice from his seniors . " " Father , " Mary Jess said in that voice of songs unsung , " if you bi lu ed that , you would n't be teaching . " Ili smile appeared to have sadness in it . " I suppose not , my dra t  | " Much as I like him , " Ben put in , " I find Thoreau full of ambivalences . " " And every one of them true , or ? shall we say ? ? supportable . " Ewing had rolled and lighted a cigarette . " The trouble with Henry David is , " he said , " you got to look hard for his best hits on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversation , Ben thought , book conversation in what some might consider a mere outpost of civilization . It had an eastern or at least a midwestern flavor , and here was an old cowboy type joining in . His surprise must have been evident , for Ewing said in an aside , " You stick around bookworms , and you get kind of wormy yourself . " " I did a term paper on Thoreau , if that qualifies me . " Ewing continued , speaking to all , " I reckon any man , any man alone , could live Thoreau-style , that 's if he chose to . But what 's left out of the tally is woman , man and woman , and young ones when it comes to that . Embarrassin ' to mention , but there 's a little item called love , and where was that in his build ? Left out ? Docked off ? And do n't tell me his love was the love of mankind , for he was shy in that department to boot . That drum he marched to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and laughed , apparently at himself . " Excuse me , you all . I 'm just a lay reader . " A door slammed at the rear of the house , and a young voice called , " Mary Jess ! " She got up , saying as she was leaving the porch , " That 's the boys , and they 'll be hungry no doubt . " Again she moved with controlled , unaffected certainty that a man could only call style , as different from stylish . " Bring them here first , will you please ? " Collingsworth asked . " We want them to meet Mr. Tate . " She returned and ushered the boys through the door . One was a thin boy with large , inquiring eyes , the other sturdy and smiling . Both were about eight years old , by guess . " Son , " Collingsworth said , speaking to the thin boy , " I want you to know Mr. Tate . My son , Charles , Mr. Tate . "  | Ben rose and took the hand gravely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? young Mort , as we call him . " " We 've been to the slough , seeing about muskrats , " the Ewing boy said . " Mr. Tate is the new owner of the Arfive Advocate , " Collingsworth told the two . " Well , that 's good . " Young Mort turned toward his father . ' There 's a lot of them there ? muskrats , I mean . " " And Charlie 's been looking to see how they live and build houses , and you , young'n , have been thinking about when furs will come prime . " " They ought to bring a dollar apiece . " " And how will you get back and forth from the ranch to your hap line ? " " I can stay some nights with Charlie . " Charlie said , " Of course you can . " " Any time , Mort . " Mary Jess motioned toward the door . " Come along to the kitchen now , boys . I 've made cookies . " On their leaving , Collingsworth fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gray eyes fixed and unblinking . At last he said , " If I dare to give one bit of advice , Mr. Tate , it is this : be chary that you do n't assume the coloration of the community . " " The community is n't bad ? " " ( ) h , no . Only provincial , only parochial , as are other communities , little or big , in their way . " " I sec , " Ben said , not sure of how much he saw . " Can a man mold that ? " " I 've managed to keep intact some of my prejudices . " The sudden smile came again , touching the whole face , the whole personality . " My chunk of advice ai n't so weighty , " Ewing said . " It 's just watch out for progress because you ca n't backtrack . " Collingsworth had risen to peer through the screen toward the drive . " More visitors . Why , it 's old Mr. Greenwood . " With the screen open , Ben could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an ancient man who stepped stiffly down . The man left the horse untied and hobbled toward the entrance . " Well , hello , Mr. Greenwood , " Collingsworth called . Then , " A pleasure to see you . Do come in . " " If I 'm not intruding . " Between the cracks in the old voice , a resonance sounded . " God bless you . " " No intrusion whatever . You know Mr. Ewing . And here is Mr. Tate , Mr. Greenwood . Mr. Tate is a newcomer to town . " Greenwood said , " Bless you , Mort , " shook hands with Ben and looked him over . A faded friendliness and the innocent blank inquiry of age showed behind eyeglasses worn askew . His dry hand had no grip . He had a fine-haired , white beard that descended over his throat , and he wore a long-skirted , black coat such as preachers once did . He made his way to a chair and sat down and put his dusty black hat on the floor . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Collingsworth told him . " So , " Greenwood answered and put a veined hand to his beard . " Good fortune , Mr. Tate . But poor Mr. Cleveland . Hard on him to give up , I imagine . " To Collingsworth he said , " He 's really not a bad man , Professor . " Ewing had been listening , not speaking , while he smoked . Now he put in , " Reverend , I reckon nobody weighs plumb bad on your scales . " " Does anybody , Mort ? Truly , does anybody ? " " I 've seen some it would n't bother me to be pallbearer to . " " Mort . Mort . " Greenwood strung out the name in shaky reproof . " All the same , it would bear hard on me to be so kind to someone who thought I was out of my mind . " Ewing had spoken with a quizzical smile . What was meant for a chuckle moved the white beard . " Many think that of me . No doubt you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinions ? Mort Ewing , you 're stickering me . " Ewing laughed . " Reverend , you always come nice to the bait . "  | Greenwood turned to Ben . " You see , Mr. Tate , I 'm a preacher turned farmer and Socialist . " The voice , by turns cackling and resonant , went on as if in senile compulsion to confession . " The pulpit has no room for one of my conscience . I believe in my soul that land ownership originated in theft and so is intolerable to justice . The good Lord made the earth for man , not men . " Collingsworth considered , his brow wrinkled . " But I ca n't get it out of my head that that 's the talk of the anarchists , the believers in wild revolution and not much beyond that . " The white beard moved up and down , sadly , it seemed . " I know , and you 've heard me . I say , if patriotism is the last refuge of the scoundrel , then the refuge of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belief is false , does it follow that no part can be true ? " " Sayin ' you 're right , which is as may be , " Ewing said , " how do you unbrand the land ? " " We can begin by recognizing the truth . Then we can pray for guidance in asserting the truth . In God 's good time , with faith , we shall see the way . " Mary Jess came from the house quietly , ending discussion , and set up a folding table . " I thought you might enjoy some iced tea , " she said . She went back into the house and returned with a tray on which she had placed a full pitcher , glasses , sugar and spoons . On a second trip she brought a plate of cookies . After Greenwood had sipped at his glass and taken a cookie , he id , " You are married , Mr. Tate ? " " No , sir . Never married . " With what seemed old familiarity , Mary Jess had sat down beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then I am reminded , " Greenwood continued , illustrating with the cookie . " If you have n't arranged for lodging or meals ? please excuse my presumption ? you could n't do better than to see Bertha Anderson ? Mrs. Anderson , that is . I do believe she has a vacancy . " Ile looked around as if for endorsement . FA , mg said , " Good woman . Good cook , too , " and Collingstth followed with , " Amen . " Mary Jess did n't say anything .  | " Fine , Mr. Greenwood . I might just do that . And thanks . " For a time they were silent . The cool of the afternoon drifted into the porch , harmonious with the chill of the tea . Greenwood wiped his beard with one of the napkins Mary Jess had supplied , put napkin and glass on the tray with a hand slightly palsied and said , " Thank you for the refreshment and company . I must be getting home . My old horse , though an internal-combustion machine of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ models . " He rose creakily . Collingsworth went to him , took his arm and saw him to the door and beyond it to the buggy , leaving the door open . He helped the old man to his seat , all the while treating him as he might have treated an heirloom , an antique , a piece of Hepplewhite in need of glue . Until Greenwood spoke and slapped it with the reins , the old horse had stood where it had stopped , as if nothing less than new works would get it going again . Back in the porch , Collingsworth said , " I fear Mr. Greenwood is n't long for this world . I should have helped him when he arrived . " " I fear he is n't even in it , " Ewing answered . " It 's passin ' strange I like him , cracked as he is . " " No , Mort . Not strange . He 's a good man , too good for some people to understand or accept . You appreciate him because you appreciate goodness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his thanks and goodbye . On him as he spoke were the eyes in the still face of the girl . He thought of that face as he drove back to town . A face with the look of waiting in it . A fine face too pensive , remembered as if seen through an enveloping mist . And the voice , the song not sung , listened for over far waters . Whispering hope .  | HE WAS N'T quite up to dinner yet , he thought as he parked his car . The tea and cookies had dulled the edge of appetite . A drink or two , then , but where ? Without a bottle he could hardly visit Mort Ewing 's club . Neither did he feel well known enough to proposition the drugstore . He walked to Billie Gayle 's place . Three old men were playing cards at a table in the rear of it . Billie limped up the far side of the counter and asked what he 'd have , his misshapen mouth uttering the words at one side . " Near beer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one uncertain hand , making two movements where one would have done had he used both . The other arm did a small , nervous dance at his side . " You are Mr. Tate ? " he said . His expression was friendly , all the friendlier because of the ruined face . " Yes . Ben Tate . " It was courteous not to offer his hand . " I 've Seen you a time or two , but not to speak to . " " One of the town 's curiosities . " The slow mouth worked at the Ards but said them without self-pity or bitterness , as if he had learned to accept himself as he was . " Oh , and give me a pack of Camels , too , please , " Ben said , knowing he was abrupt . But infirmities , talked of firsthand , made a mail , any man , uncomfortable . Billie looked at him , as if understanding , said , " Sure , Ben , " and shuffled for cigarettes . He put them on the counter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and moved back to the card players . Ben drank his drink slowly , puffed at a cigarette , then another ,  | wanting neither , and went out wishing that somehow he had been more adroit in talking to Billie . He went to his room in the Arfive House , washed hands and face in the one bathroom on the floor , then changed shirt and tie . Possibly he would , possibly would n't , call on the rooming-house lady tonight . He had dinner at Eva Fox 's , which at this tardy hour had only a couple of customers , one of whom he might have seen before . Eva had recommended beef stew , with good reason . After the two customers had gone , Eva Fox came to his table and asked , " New broom , huh ? When does it sweep ? " " Wo n't you sit down , Mrs. ? or is it Miss ? ? Fox ? " " Just Eva . Plain Eva , " she answered , taking a seat across from him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think you do , it 's Monday . " " No change in rates ? " " Not to my knowledge . I do n't know yet . " " Better not be , " she said , smiling . She was a big woman and struck him as motherly . Her hair , dressed without one hair out of place , was turning white . " I 'm a regular advertiser . Six main dishes on Sunday , all freshly cooked , and steamed clams or fresh oysters for extras . But the prices I have to pay and to charge ! That 's why I asked about space rates . " " Be at ease for now , anyhow . " " Sixty cents for a T-bone steak ? can you imagine that ? ? and the country crawling with beef that wo n't net a rancher enough for a consolation bottle . Wheat 's worse , what there 'll be of it . This is the driest July known to man , or almost . " She pushed back as if to go , saying , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rye . " He said , before she could leave , " Now that 's out of your system , any advice to a cub newspaperman ? " " Advice ? " " I 've been getting some . " " Such as ? " " Professor Collingsworth told me to beware of becoming too  | much like the community . It was thought and attitude he referred to , I 'm sure . No reflection on the town , though . I think he meant imprisonment in locality , wherever it was . " Eva nodded . " Hard thing to do , Ben . Bias and ignorance kind of creep into you . Not that Mr. Collingsworth has n't some bias himself , but God knows he imported it . Still , he 's a brainy man and an honest one , not to be led by the nose . What else ? " " Mr. Ewing said to watch out for progress because you could n't go back . " " That 's Mort for you . He has spells , I bet , when he deplores the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to speak , do n't we all ? " " Now , " he said , " what do you have to add to the maxims ? " " Smart boy , using maxims . ' " She thought for a moment and rose and smiled . Out of her motherly face came , " Keep in mind , sinnin ' is fun . " " Wait a minute , now . Wait a minute , Eva . One other thing . " Ile looked up at her , standing . " For accommodations it 's been suggested that I see one Mrs. Bertha Anderson . " " Damnation , man , I 've lost a customer . That old biddy sets a good table , everyone says . " " So ? " " Well , see her . You wo n't be sorry . But , Ben , remember I 'll still he in business . You , your nice clothes and all , add a cadiet ? that 's in exchange for your maxims ' ? to my place , besides putting cash in the till . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 'll remember , I promise . " " Promise filed . Go two blocks west and one north , and you 'll find her house , white and green , two-story , on the northwest corner . Her widowed daughter lives with her , but do n't get ideas . They 'll be dashed . " A stillness hung over the town , over the whole land , wherever stars shone or would shine , for the twilight was too light for stars yet , save for one low in the west that kept a kind eye on the mountains . The quiet air came into the lungs as if of itself , as if by itself making sure that he prospered , free even of the tiny effort of  | breathing . Under this sky , in this silence a man felt ? a man knew ? possibilities infinite . The Anderson house rose clean against the horizon . It was an old-fashioned house , its open front porch scalloped and furbelowed . A couple of chairs stood on the porch . High in one corner some small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ben 's knock . " Good evening , " he said . " You 're not Mrs. Anderson ? " She had fair hair , cut rather short , and one of those fair faces so open as to suggest no underneath artifice . " No . I 'm sorry . It 's Mother 's night for auction . " Her generous mouth was wide with a smile . " Auction ? " " All right . " Her voice was pleasant . " Auction bridge , then . Successor to five hundred . I 'm Mattie Murchison . " " I see . I 'm Ben Tate . I wanted to ask her about lodging and , possibly , board . " " Wo n't you sit down ? I 'll play Mother 's little substitute . " She motioned toward a chair and took one herself . She wore a full skirt too long for flappers and a white blouse , and her step was more nearly a stride , an easy , free-flowing movement . A self-sufficient woman , he thought , a business type probably . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she said , " Well , I believe that 's Mother now . What in Sam Hill ? " A figure emerged from the car and became a small , quick woman with gloves and a hat on . " I do declare , " she said as she approached , " if I did n't forget my glasses . " " Mother ! Again ? I 'll find them , but do meet Mr. Tate , Mr. Ben Tate . " " Hurry , then . I had to beg a ride . How do you do , Mr. Tate ? " She sat down as if briefly , a rather old woman dressed in a style certainly old except for a cloche hat fixed to her head with precision . " I 'm looking for lodging and perhaps a few meals , Mrs. Anderson , " he said in the daughter 's absence . " Rather permanent , I think . Mr. Greenwood advised me to try here . "  | " He must have liked you . " Her small smile seemed to suggest that Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happens I have a room , one of those rare ones with a bath of its own . Of course it comes higher . " Her eyes questioned him about that . " Good . " Mrs. Murchison reappeared . " Here are your glasses , Mother . " " Thank you . And now what about meals , Mr. Tate ? We serve breakfast at seven-thirty . " " That 's fine . And just a couple of evening meals ? Let me see . Not Wednesday or Thursday . First press run is Wednesday and paper day 's Thursday , and I might have to work late . What about Tuesday and Saturday ? " " Oh , dear . Tuesday 's my bridge night . " " What does it matter , Mother ? " Mrs. Murchison put in . " We have to eat anyhow . Ferd expects his supper , and I 'll be here right after work . " " I just did n't want to burden you . But all right . Let me figure , Mr. Tate . If the room pleases you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars a week ? " " Not at all . " " Will you show him the room then , Mattie ? I do have to run . " She bustled up and , bustling , went to the waiting car . " Call me Mattie , " Mrs. Murchison said . " Our only other roomer and boarder wo n't bother you . Ferd Montjoy is his name . He keeps books . " " It 's Ben then . " " Ben it is . Ferd 's quite a gentleman . His only vice , I guess you could say , is panguingue . " ' " That sounds like a cardinal sin . What is it ? " " Pan for short . A glorified rummy game , as I understand , that runs into money . They play it ferociously at both of our fair city 's pool halls . But come on . I 'll show you the room . " Moving ahead of him , she took him upstairs , snapping light switches on as she went . She was , he thought , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , could n't they ? The downstairs , from what he had time to see of it , appeared well-furnished . and tidy . The room was large and airy , equipped with a chif- fonier , a long table , a straight and an easy chair , a double bed with a blue counterpane and , unexpectedly , a large bookcase awaiting his books . Three gay scatter rugs lay on the polished floor . A door to a small bathroom was open . " Some people prefer an eastern exposure . But here , " she said , standing before a large window , " you can look west toward the mountains . " " Yes . " " You 'll be warm enough . Just last year , when the gas line was laid , we converted our coal furnace . " He said , " Yes , " again . " Ferd 's room is across and down the hall , next door to the other bathroom . Mother and I live downstairs in the back . We wo n't bother you or you us . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's never locked . " She turned her head to look at him . " Well , Ben , what 's the verdict ? " " What it has to be . Home again . Mattie , it 's just right . The one question is : when may I move in ? " " Any time . " " Tomorrow , then ? " " Yes . Mother will be home all day . And later I 'll be on hand to help if you need me , after I get through at the treasurer 's office . " " Count it settled then . " She preceded him down the stairway , her loose-knit body moving with that swift freedom he 'd noted before . He took her hand before he left . It was a square , warm hand , appropriate to a face that must hold secrets because it appeared to hold none .  | BEN LEANED FORWARD in his chair , set his elbows on the desk and let his head rest in his hands . Two weeks as a publisher , and he already felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day comparatively . Late afternoon , and he ought to get up , take his hat and walk to Mrs. Anderson 's table , where company and food were equally good , if a man had the appetite for either . Or the will to move . To prosper , a country newspaperman had to hustle at the expense of what he most wanted to do . Selling advertising , taking orders for job work and lending a hand in the shop , keeping books , collecting bills , meeting callers , jotting down personal items ? these and a score of other chores stood in the way of good editorship . And , good Lord , the scrambled accounts Cleveland had bequeathed him ! Night work in his room , where he had installed his portable typewriter , a stack of copy paper beside it ? Sure , except for a little item called energy . He had had barely enough of it to take stabs at his reading . There was nothing else for it : he would have to hire someone to assist in the office , someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , write personals and make sense of the books . But who ? Yeah , who . Not one of the fussy old widows or busybody clubwomen who so loved good literature . Not a highschool student , no matter how promising , because of the hours demanded by classes . Not a man ? he could n't afford it . And not Mattie Murchison , whose job in the treasurer 's office was better than the one he could offer . But Mort Ewing might have an idea .  | He roused himself to lift the phone and call the ranch . A surprisingly pleasant voice answered . " Mrs. Ewing ? " " Yes . " " This is Ben Tate . May I speak to Mr. Ewing ? " " Oh , hello , Mr. Tate . Mort has talked about you . But he 's in town on business . Possibly he 's in the Club now , improving his appetite . " The laugh was like the flutter of a wing . He thanked her and hung up and then called the Anderson residence . Mattie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " but do n't count on me for dinner tonight . Business . " " And it gives beef roast and Yorkshire pudding and fresh apple pie . Shame on you . " " Mort Ewing 's in town , and I want to see him . " " Oh , all right . " She added , " Do n't let it suggest anything , sir , but the stove has made me too hot to handle , anyway . It 's Mother 's bridge night , you know . " " I want to talk to you , too . " " Now ? " " You can be thinking about it . I need help in the office , probably female , someone to spare me at least part of the routine . Any ideas ? " " I 'll put my mind to it . " Afterwards , he got up , put on his hat and went out , feeling better at the prospect of help . A couple of weeks more , and the season for sailor straws would have passed . The day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadows of the west-side buildings lay long on the street . Not a breath of breeze stirred the leaves of the flanking cottonwoods , but the air was new , recovered and buoyant after the afternoon heat . It was the hour to gaze at the sun-setting sky , if a man had the time . Ewing was not at the club . Neither was anyone else , save for old Macalester Cleveland and his dog , the one drinking , the other drowsing . Cleveland said , " Hi , Ben . How 's the veteran editor ? " " All right , Mr. Mack . Hope you are . Mort Ewing been in ? "  | " Not lately . I just got here myself . Have a drink . " " I guess not . Anyhow , I have my own bottle . " " Aw , come on and sit , goddamn it . Drink on me . I could howl like a coyote for lonesomeness . " Ben took a glass and water and sat down at Cleveland 's table . " Mrs. Ewing said Mort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his breath sounding from the small effort . " All newspapermen drink , " he said . " To put it another way , the men who drink are the men who think . " " What would you say , after seeing two issues ? Have I been thinking enough ? Any suggestions ? " " Not exactly , Ben . " Cleveland lit a cigar and blew smoke through his mustache . " Not exactly ? " Cleveland heaved back , his vest open , his belly pouched over his vest . " You 're doing well enough , better than I did at the last . " His eyes went blank , considering the roll of the years , back to the young days of his newspapermaking . He might not have known he took another turn at his glass . " The facts of life , " he said as if to himself . " They 're not all romp . " " Not the birds and the bees and then the blissful bed , huh ? " " Forget it . Just let me get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All right , Mr. Mack , but forget what ? " " Forget it 's adjustment , not divinity , that shapes our ends , Mr. Shakespeare . " He fell silent , his head back , his eyes on the ceiling , as if alone . His belly , rather than his chest , rose and fell with his breath . When Ben spoke , it was just to rouse him . " A Mr. Stoneman called at the office today . " " Yeah ? " " Jerry Stoneman . " " Copper man . Representative of the Anaconda . Slick lobbyist . " " You know him then ? " " Who does n't ? " " He seemed like a nice enough man . "  | " They 're all nice guys , nicest on earth if you 're nice to them . Mean sons of bitches . " " He made no bones about his connections . " Cleveland straightened now and drank to bring himself back to the present . " The company has its goddamn finger in every pie . Go against it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without which you ca n't get along . " " Lose it how ? " " The company will see you 're underbid . Besides , it will manage to take advertising away from you . And if you want financial help ? Not likely . The banks are the company 's friends . Hell of a note , Ben . We 'll drink to it . " " And the people put up with it ? " " The fact is , " Cleveland said , ignoring the question , " that a newspaper ca n't survive in Montana if it bucks the company . I ought to know . I tried it on the other slope . " " I asked about the people . " " The people , shit ! " Cleveland began growling low in his throat , the tired growl of failure . " No need to go on . Christ ! " " Do n't then , if you do n't want to , but I 'm interested . " " Just remember , Ben , the company always confuses the issues . During @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troubles and fair taxation . Still is patriotism , if not as strong as before , but the enemy 's not Germans or pro-Germans but socialists alias bolsheviks . " " I ca n't believe the people can be hoodwinked all the time . " " No ? The company has a stable , state-wide , of retainers and favorites . Watch that pluperfect patriot , Earl Kilmer . I bet he 's being groomed for the legislature . " Cleveland downed the last of his drink and got up to go . A sudden , embered anger showed in his old features . " The people voted Joe Dixon out of the governor 's chair , thanks to Anaconda and the owned or bought or pressured help of damn near every big and scrawny newspaper in the state . I was on that shit list . " He took a step toward the lockers , the heel of whiskey in his hand , then turned and brandished his chewed cigar . " But do n't  | you think , by God , I was too tame . I skated a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anger died . The cigar went into a spittoon . " Old men talk too much . With me as an editor , Ben , it was go somewhere or nowhere . I wanted to go somewhere , if it was only to the bank with a deposit . " He put the bottle in a locker . " Grub 's ready at my house . Come on , Bluster . Good luck , Ben . " The old dog followed him out just as Mort Ewing came in . " How , Ben , " Ewing said . " I been reading the paper . Looks to me like you 're tailing it up . " " Thanks . " " Have a drink . " " On me this time . " Ben stepped to the locker and took out his unopened bottle , drew half-portions of water into glasses and followed Ewing to a table . " Mr. Mack has been singing the blues . " " So would you , under that tormentin ' burden of booze . " " I 'd say that 's not all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you about something else . " " Sing away . " " I need office help , part-time anyway . I 'm thinking of a woman because , well , I doubt I could pay enough to attract a good man . Ben had opened the bottle and now offered it to Ewing , who poured for them both and said , " Skoal . " " To the northland . " " Skoal . But do n't fall on your spear . " Ben had time to think that this cow-country rancher must have read everything . " You do n't want some skitty filly ? " Ewing asked . " God help me , no . " " Someone educated and not broke down . You said part- or full-time ? " " Either one , I guess . " Ewing considered , then said in a drawl , " Well , from this distance I kind of think I see one critter in the corral . " ' Take a closer look . "  | " Scared to , kind of , but , on inspection , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How about Mary Jess Collings-worth ? " " Good Lord , do you think there 's a chance ? " Ben asked , but already he was hearing that muted , musical voice answering the telephone , already seeing that grave , controlled girl handling visitors . " Might be . " Ewing put his glass to his lips and then went on . " She 's well-educated and young , and she 's living her life just for her dad and young brother , and Charlie 's old enough now not to need a ma all the time . " Ile broke off long enough to roll a cigarette and get it lighted . " It 's this way , Ben , as you would find out in a little while anyhow . Mrs. Collingsworth ? May , she was , and as fine a woman as you 'll ever see ? she died when Charlie was horn . We took care of the baby , along with our own , and he 's lived off and on with us ever since ? that is , until Mary Jess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and him . A good boy , Charlie . But it 's time Mary Jess struck out more or less on her own . Not fair to her just to be housekeeper , and her young and unmarried . " " Would Mr. Collingsworth take kindly to the idea ? " Ewing examined his empty glass . " Is it thirty on the whiskey , Ben ? " " No , not to a man who talks newspaper talk , " Ben answered as he passed the bottle . " Now , assumin ' you 're agreeable , you want me to sound out Mary Jess and her dad ? " " Would you ? I 'm more than agreeable . " " Sure thing . Maybe tonight since I 'm already in town . You goin ' to be home ? " " Bound home in a few minutes . " " I 'll report . " Ewing took his drink in a gulp . " That 's that , then . Now for the feedbag . Want to join me ? " " Thanks . I think I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ewing had gone , then got up and went out and walked home . He did n't have to eat supper . Good food for good thought was supper enough .  | Mattie met him at the door . " Come on into the dining room . I 've kept things warm , some things anyway . I just got back from taking Mother to her bridge club . " " You did n't have to think about me . " " No , but I did . Come on . " His place was set . She brought in a platter and bowls and sat opposite him and waited until he had taken the edge off the appetite he had n't known he had . Between bites he kept looking up at her , at the fair , open face with eyes wide apart . Not a vulnerable face , surely , but one that seemed to share and reflect the undisclosed feelings of others . " Well , " she said , " did an idea come to you ? " " One came to Mort Ewing . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a secret maybe so far . He suggested Mary Jess Collingsworth . " She sat silent for a moment , her fine eyes examining him . " Yes . She would do . " " Except ? " " Well , out with it , Ben . I suspect you 're stuck on that girl . You 've talked about her . I 've seen you walking and talking to her after church . Is that the reason you go ? " " I was brought up that way . " " Fiddlededee , and coarser words to that effect . You 're stuck on her . " " Thanks for telling me . " " I do n't blame you . She 's a lovely , if a cool and remote one . " " I have eyes . " " Sure you do , and what do they see ? They see that look of pure innocence , of everlasting virtue , that every man wants to defile . " " Mattie ! " ? F o rectify , then . " " You know everything . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not the answer to this , for instance : how would romance go with the job ? " " I 'll make my own matches , Mattie. "  | " Do n't be cross . What makes you so cross ? " " Too much work . " " I suppose , " she said , as if she did n't altogether agree . " But , Ben , I endorse the nomination . Ignore my misgivings . " " Thanks , Mattie , and thanks for keeping things warm . " He watched her full-skirted stride as she returned the dishes to the kitchen . " If you 'll excuse me , I have some typing to do . " But the typewriter balked , and a face and a figure kept floating over the print when he tried to read . It was near midnight before Ewing called . " Get on your horse , Ben , " he said .  | " How ABOUT GOING to the Eversole auction ? " Ben asked . " Take the afternoon off ? " " I have n't finished making out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done the posting . " Papers and blanks and the account book before her , she was seated at the flat desk he had installed , thus crowding the office . Grave as always , competent as proven , direct of eye , he thought as he looked at her . Somehow someone sometime would add vivacity to her credentials . " You forget it 's Saturday , and afternoon at that . Okay can take care of the callers , if any . " " By the time we get there the auction will be over , or almost . " " No . Big stuff first . The crowd will stick around to see the pots and pans go . " She sighed , as if slightly vexed at leaving chores undone , and rose from her chair , her actions neat and controlled as he had learned to expect . " All right , I guess , if the boss says so . " " Just a minute , then . " He ducked into the shop , where Okay Myers was methodically distributing type . " Can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll listen . " The unsmiling face held a question . A good man , Myers , if somewhat grouchy , a man destined to spend his life at type boxes , chases and presses until time tossed him into the hell box . To the unasked question Ben said , " Yes ? " " I been thinking . My oldest boy ? he 's twelve now ? he could be helping out . Putting away leads and slugs , swamping out , melting and skimming off Linotype metal , and the like of that ? "  | The idea was good , though open to slight suspicion . Myers had n't been given a chance to purchase the plant : now his disappointment , his view of himself , demanded this trifling concession . Ben answered , " Sure . We 'll fix it up . We can talk about pay later . " " No need to . After school , all day Saturday , Sunday if needed . I can teach him in off hours . Dollar a week is enough to start . " A good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hupmobile . They rode east , toward the hill that rose to the bench . " You know the Eversoles ? " Ben asked when they were under way . " Slightly . Enough to feel sorry for them . He owns , or did own before the foreclosure , perhaps a thousand acres of land . " " That sounds like enough . " " But it 's poor land , Father and Mort Ewing say , and it 's not irrigated , as some of the benchland is . Also , you know the price of wheat . Fifteen years according to Father , and nothing earned besides callouses . " All these foreclosures , all these auctions , " he said . " Look on the bright side , " she answered , her gaze turned down . " They bring you legal notices and display advertising . " " I will be damned ! " " But solvent . " She ought to be told that , solvent , he could continue to be an employer . She ought to be told that a country beset by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to be told , she ought to know , that no decent man could rejoice if he survived by the wreckage of others . She ought to be told a lot of things . But one of them was not how to write . They rode on silently , a wall between them , until he said , " Change of subject , but that coyote piece was simply beautiful , as I 've told you before . " " Thank you , Ben . " " Beautiful , " he repeated and thought about it . The piece , run as an editorial signed by her , had been prompted by the news that a federal hunter had been hired to put an end to the coyotes that roamed near the Breast River , a few miles north and west of the  | town . He had titled it " Coyote Song or Lamb Blat ? " It was a sort of hymn to wilderness , to loneliness and the cry that came from it , and it included the point , in expert , accented prose , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or oftener than not the work of town and ranch dogs . The detection of a guilty dog two days after the paper came out had modified criticism . " I expected more kicks than I got , " he said . " Few from stockmen . The chief kicker was your Mr. Kilmer . " " Mine ! " " He and Hank Stutemeyer and Alvor Torgerson , and of than only Stutemeyer owns sheep , and it a small band . " " They 're certainly not friends of ours . You may not know that Kilmer has vowed to get Father , to have him voted down by the board : they 're your Legion friends . " " All right . I joined the Legion , but they 're not buddies of mine . The Legion does do something . It can contribute more . I joined it to help . " " I would think an objective newspaperman should be on the outside looking in , not on the inside looking out . " " Two points of view , " he answered . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Obviously . " A hell of a way to spend an otherwise pleasant afternoon , volleying a cactus with a pretty girl ? no , a lovely and fetching one whose nature and name were cantankerous . He wanted to penetrate her ? wrong word but , all right , right , too ? to understand her and to be understood , to come to amiable terms that would lead to more than amiability , but here they were , as much at odds as a couple about to divorce . Ile drove up the hill , not speaking , and saw the flatlands swimming to the shores of the sky , broken here and there by a house or barn and little huddles of despairing trees . She said , " Would you mind turning off for a minute , ahead and there to the left ? " He took a dirt trail that branched from the gravel road . It brought them to a point of land overlooking the valley . ' I ' lie sun was beginning to slant clown toward the nmountains . Now , in late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the equinox , it shone , not hot , but kindly , and it mellowed the fields , trees and town buildings below . With the car engine shut off , a great silence came , a great stillness , and it struck him that , if a pebble were dropped in the valley , quiet ripples would lap to the edges of sight and beyond . After a silence she said , her eyes lost in looking , " Look , Ben . Just look . " He could see the canyon of the Breast River , purple with distance , and the meandering , tree-fringed flow of the stream , and the buttes and foothills that separated mountains and river , and it seemed to him that all bore the unchanging face of forever . " Father , the tool of progress , remains half-antiquarian . " Her voice came from far away , from whatever her eyes saw , with the muted music in it so much expected as sometimes not to be heard . " There would be tepees in the big bend of the river , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the smokeholes and the horse herd nearby and buffalo on the ridge to the south . And no one would foreclose or compel others to sell what little they had . " The singing , not-singing voice , the words painting pictures , the girl as far beyond reach as the times spoken of ? they went together and together raised from the dust an unreal and sad hunger . He could see buffalo now and white lodges and wild grasses saluting the breeze , and a squaw , a certain squaw , in this free land welcoming her man to the tepee . She let him take her hand . " But no telephones , though , " he said to break his own spell . " No electric lights or power . No radios . No automobiles . " " But no ugly fences , no torn earth and no buying and selling and counting the cost or the profit . " " No newspapers . " " No newspapers , just smoke signals . " " That 's a pretty fancy . Borrowed from Mr. Greenwood ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say it 's borrowed . " " I 'll say it 's unrealistic . We have to live in the now time . We must live in that time and work for the future . " " Whatever it is . " " I can hope it 's a better way of life . I can pin my faith on that .  | A better , more comfortable , more prosperous way . With prosperity people would n't have to sell out . This reaching for the past has its charms , but it 's sentimental , not practical . You know that . " She said , " I wonder what practicality is . " " At least we know that progress does n't reside in a tepee . " " Is its home in the bank ? " " Come off it , Mary Jess . " She stirred , drew her limp hand from his and shook her head , as if , he thought , to shake the subject out . She pointed ahead of them . " That little heap of rocks at the brow of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " An Indian is buried there on the point , a half-Indian , a friend . " " Oh ? " " His name was Smoky Moreau . He was born too late for true and free tribal life , but from around dying council fires and talks with the old ones he learned what that once-life was . " " And followed it ? " " As best he could . He hunted and roamed and enjoyed himself , if he did , with the dead . Sometimes I think he thought the white men would all blow away . He certainly thought the homesteaders would , as some or many are doing . But he was a gentle man , a gentle , sad man . " " What happened to him ? " " He and Father used to get together . They went out , just the two of them , to stream and field and mountain . But they never talked much , not that I heard . It was as if they knew each other without speech . I guess you could say they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ? " " He died on the reservation . I do n't know from what , but probably some white man 's disease . Father gave the funeral oration , surrounded by full bloods with braided hair and skin britches . But Smoky wanted to be buried here . " She made an encompassing gesture . " Here , where he could overlook the valley he knew and see his old visions . " She paused and went on as if she were saying . nothing strange , " Father often comes here to talk to him . "  | He did n't have an answer . He could n't say that only people well along in years talked about the good old times . He could n't question her about the oddities of her father . He started the engine , put the car in gear and turned around . The auction was well along , attended by perhaps a hundred men and women together with children and conducted by a man named Baker , by custom referred to as " Colonel . " In scatters and groups stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sawbucks , furniture , and on tables the considerable , small miscellanies of housekeeping . Frank Brobeck , half-listening to the auctioneer , said from the edge of the crowd , " Hi , Ben . Hi , Miss Collingsworth . " A smile stretched the seams of his face . " Buying , Frank ? " " A few tools . Nothing like an auction to get them dirt-cheap . Brought my old truck along in case I bought more , but some bids were n't dirt-cheap but high as a flagstaff . " Ben made way through the crowd for Mary Jess and himself . Mr. Collingsworth sat at a table , pen in hand , a journal before him . He often served as clerk at auctions and doubtless more often was asked to . People knew he was honest . He nodded to Mary Jess and Ben , the briefest of smiles touching his mouth . Colonel Baker , flushed from whiskey , the sun or his work or all three , had his hand on a saddle horse . " Now , folks , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine animal sold , we 'll get to what you good ladies came for . Now here 's a prize mare . Gentle as a dog and dog-smart to boot . A family horse , this is , right for the missus , the kids or the old man himself . Good with stock . Knows a cow 's mind better than the cow its own self . What am I bid . Fifty ? Fifty ? " The mare sold for forty dollars . A couple stood at the back door of the house , a couple not old but bent and expressionless , as if years of effort , coming to naught , had brought them to the same place . Before he asked Mary Jess , Ben knew they were the Eversoles . She greeted them with a small wave of her hand , her lips moving in a smile of regret .  | He turned and let his gaze travel over the furniture and , with her at his side , walked toward it . " I hate this , " she said , her tone pitched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their bones . " " But it has to be , Mary Jess . They need every cent they can scrape up . " The rags and tags of living , of having lived . Just junk , and soon not even their own . " " Is it ? " he asked and tried to check a growing enthusiasm . " Do you think it is ? " He laid his hand on a chest . Her eyes studied him and went to the chest . " It 's been painted and repainted and painted again . Pitiful . Hardly worth the effort . I 've seen a hundred like it . " He knew better . He took a knife from his pocket and scraped a patch bare at the far edge of the chest . " Cherry , " he told her , " or I 'm blind . A swell-front cherry chest . " " And is that so unusual ? " " It 's better than good . And look at that stand table . Hepplewhite , or I do n't know the first thing about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was talking outside of her knowledge . " They 're antiques , Mary Jess , " he tried to explain . " The real thing . Perhaps as much as a hundred years old , maybe older . " He pulled out a drawer of the chest . " Look at the dovetailing . You wo n't see such work in modern furniture . We 'll inquire . " He steered her back toward the Eversoles . " I 'm Ben Tate . You are Mr. and Mrs. Eversole ? " The man nodded tardily , as if even his name might be gone . ' Hie woman stared through Ben and past him . " I wonder if you could tell me something about the chest of drawers there and the table alongside ? " " They 're there , " Mr. Eversole said . " See for yourself . " " Yes . I was looking . You 've had them for a long time ? " Now Mrs. Eversole spoke , her mouth twisted . " Too long . Should have ditched them ? but no money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them in Montana ? "  | Mr. Eversole said , " They was handed down . Hand-me-downs , that 's what they are . " " From where ? " " Tennessee or somewhere . That 's where Effie 's granddaddy came from . " " That 's interesting . " " Maybe . Came by steamboat to Fort Benton . That 's the story I git . " " You ask me , " Mrs. Eversole said , " I wished many a time , while sloppin ' paint on , they 'd been pitched in the river . " " At least they have a story to tell . " Mr. Eversole turned and spit and said through a mouth that managed to turn up . " Yep . Sad story . " They left the two waiting impassively , hardly listening to the auctioneer 's spiel . Two old people , Ben thought , two middleaged people made old by event , by toil and soil and weather and the price that wheat brought . " You do n't like old things , Ben , " Mary Jess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ho ! " " They do n't make things like that anymore . I 've hardly seen a decent stick of furniture in Montana . The best is bad , bulky Victorian . Simple explanation : family pieces went by the great waterways . Too clumsy for wagons , too heavy for ox teams . " " You might extend your admiration for old furniture . " " All right , " he said , letting the words be stiff . " Call me inconsistent , eccentric , anything , but leave it at that . " They waited , wordless , until the auctioneer and the crowd came around , and the furniture was put up for bids . Ben got the chest for eight dollars and the table for two ? giveaways both , honest-to-God bargains , Ben thought , dismissing the stares of people who no doubt were wondering how soon he and Mary Jess would become housekeepers . Let them wonder . He found Brobeck at his side and said to him , " Frank , you have room in your truck for what I just bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where would you want them delivered ? " His gaze went to Mary Jess , and mischief came into his eyes . " There ? "  | " Just drop them off in back of the shop . " Mr. and Mrs. Eversole were standing as before , except , Ben thought , that with each purchase it was as if a layer of themselves had been peeled . They would be left naked , in their hands money enough maybe to serve as fig leaves . Adam and Eve , about to be cast , wild and alone , from an unhappy garden . He saw Mrs. Eversole put a hand to her mouth as a highchair was sold . No tears , no open lamenting , just surrender to fact . And he had a swell-front and a Hepplewhite . Without explanation he left Mary Jess and went to the Eversoles . The auctioneer and the crowd had moved a few yards away . " I did n't pay enough for the chest and the table , " he said to the unrevealing faces . " A deal 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is cheating . I 'll give the pieces back or pay what I think is a fair price . " Eversole 's eyes were cold . " Mister , " he said , " I do n't know what your game is , for I never seen the like of it . Like I say , a deal 's a deal , and you can damn well get in your head that we ai n't on charity yet . Understand ! " Ben turned away , to find Mary Jess right behind him . They walked to the Hupmobile . Then she said , singing , a new look in her eyes , " Ben , I 'm sorry .  | MACALESTER CLEVELAND put the latest issue of the Advocate aside , took his watch from a vest pocket and flipped the lid open . Christ , not quite four o'clock , and Mag Egstrom frowned and went silent if he took off for the Club quite that early . Mag for Nag . He picked up the paper again . That boy , Ben Tate , was doing all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer fallowing of dry land , which was pretty new in this section yet but by proof was far more profitable than seeding the same acreage season on season . Hope for Montana and the county in that . And here was an interview with that spokesman for the Bureau of Reclamation , which wanted to dam the Breast River and irrigate land otherwise unproductive except for what little in native grasses it grew . And Ben had n't been satisfied with that statement alone . He 'd consulted the state college , which said that the full fruits of irrigation could n't be realized by the first generation of farmers . It took a second or a third before the uses of soil and the ways of water were learned . Small comfort for the first generation on the Medicine project , but hope for its sons . Anyhow , the articles were n't just county-agent handouts or commercial-club crap . And it was n't crap but a boost to the town and the paper that a J. C. Penney store soon would start operations . And it was true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fussing around in the kitchen , where , like as not , she was preparing Swedish meatballs or some other dish dear to the Scandinavian palate . A fussy , fat old lady . It was hard to believe that once , having employed her as housekeeper after his wife 's death , he used to take her to bed . The very thought was  | enough to give a man the droops , if they were n't chronic already . Was n't it some ancient Greek , grown old , who said to a joking question about his sex life , " Young man , every day I thank the gods for having delivered me from that savage and insatiable monster " ? Huh . Well , huh . Mag came to the door to ask , " Would n't you like some tea and cookies , Mack ? " What she had left of hair was drawn back from her forehead , over a face that showed wear . " No , " he said as usual . Tardily he added , " Thanks . " " Why do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was always trying to delay his departure . " Just because they 've quit playing , Yes , We Have No Ba-nanas ' ? " She made a noise in her throat and retired . There was always some damn pesky , well-meaning person around when a man grew too old for anything but the chair and a bottle . Always trying to temper his habits , to see his diet was wholesome , to keep him alive , when all he wanted was to spend what life he had left in any manner he chose . As if his occupying space meant a damn ! Still , was n't that his own way with the dog , nursing it along when it ought to be dead ? The dog slept at the side of his chair , too far gone to whimper at the dream of a rabbit or perhaps to have dreams at all . He just slept and farted in sleep , making a stench against which a cigar was protection . That was the way of age , to drowse and break wind and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and got a bottle from the scuffed cowboy boot in which he had cached it . Empty , of course , as he knew it would be . Problem : how to dispose of the empty . He put it back in the boot , for the time being . He sat down again and again looked at his watch . Still too early if he wanted to avoid Mag 's displeasure . He fiddled with the stack of magazines in the rack at his side . The Saturday Evening Post , Harper 's , the Nation , the American Mercury . Except for the Post , they would put the dander up in the patriots ? but that man , Mencken , knew how to flay boobs . So , in a different way , did Sinclair Lewis . A losing battle ,  | though . Too many boobs , too many heads with paralyzed cerebrums . He returned the magazines to the rack , lit a cigar and leaned back . In sight on the dresser was a picture of his wife , his wife long dead and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he kept it . The likeness stirred no dear memories . So time healed all wounds , did it ? And left only vacancy , a vague sense of loss and the sore wish to care again . Even to care for Mag , the old fool . She had been with him fifteen years , slept with him for five or so and still concerned herself with his health . Once people had talked , he knew , but there was a thing you could say in their favor . For a while they conjectured , they gossiped , they professed to be scandalized , but after a time they took an enduring illicit relationship as a matter of course . And when you grew too old for sinning , they thought the relationship nice . All forgiven if ever truly condemned . He rose and drew on his hat . " Come on , you potlicker , " he said , nudging the dog with the toe of his shoe . Mag heard him and came again to the door . " Oh , are you going out ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't it ? " " Well ? " " The good ladies of the Methodist church are giving a dinner , " he said . " I just ca n't miss that . " " Your dinner will be ready at six-thirty . Please do n't be late . " " Make it seven , Mag . " " Well , then , " she said , reluctance in her voice . " But you 're not going out without an overcoat . " She disappeared through the door and came out with it . He heard that noise in her throat as he walked outside . His old Velie stood at the side of the street , parked crookedly , as if he had been unsteady last night , forsooth . He lifted the dog inside , got in himself , started the engine and pulled away , not changing gears . Low gear all the way . That was the gear for him , low . He parked by the drugstore and went in . Spence Green knew  | what he wanted and handed it over . Only three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he helped the dog from the car , walked to the steps of the Club and went down , the dog slow at his slow heels . The Club was deserted . He took a glass and water and sat down at his accustomed place . The dog dropped at his place and fell asleep . The first drink of the day had to be a jolt . A jolt , yes . That was the medicine . Nerve medicine . A man got so he had to drink for his nerves , among other good reasons . What the hell had he told young Ben Tate not so long ago ? How to run a newspaper , huh ? Big joke . He downed the jolt and poured a bartender 's drink . All those years , the good years . When he met Saint Peter , assuming the old boy still guarded the assumed portals , he would have to say , " Pete , old pard , I did my best , " and Pete would answer , " No room for liars , Mack . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pete , there were mitigations . " " We call them excuses . " " You 're a hard man . " " Saints do n't get there by compromise . We 've no room for slackers , either . " " No one but a fool ever called me a slacker . " " Defined as one who has not made the most of what he 's been given . In short , life 's malingerers . Sorry . " " All right . I 'll go to hell and have a drink . " Then , if Saint Peter were a decent son of a bitch , as not all his certified residents were , he would say , " Hold it , Mack . Slow day today . I 'll lock the joint up and have a shot with you . " The conversation was interrupted by the entrance of Doc Crabtree , Hank Stuteineyer , and Earl Kilmer , who could be relied on to show up at about this time of day . Doc Crabtree said , " Hi , Mack . How 's retirement ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , last few minutes . " The door came open again and admitted Peter Sears , who looked satisfied with the day 's department-store sales . He gave a bright , " flow you , gang ? "  | " You want to pile cirrhosis on top of Bright 's disease ? " Doc Crabtree asked Cleveland . Sears took a seat and sipped at his whiskey . " Why not ? " Cleveland answered . " It 's a way of euthanasia . " " Hardly a pleasant one , but it 's your choice , old friend . " " Me , " Earl Kilmer said , " I wish you were still at the helm of the paper . " It was as if dedication had purified his face , removing the wrinkles and warts of uncertainty . " Me , too , " Stutemeyer said . He was a rangy galoot with no back to his head . Do n't beware the lean and hungry look , Caesar . Beware the want of occiput . " Young Tate 's doing all right , " Cleveland said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought that piece about the darn and irrigation was good , " Sears broke in to say . He was safe enough in so saying . Otherwise he would n't have spoken . Businessmen had to fight shy of controversy . " That crap about coyotes written by the Collingsworth girl , " Stutemeyer said . " Yeah . " It was Kilmer speaking . " She ought to be called the coyote girl . " " Did n't you beau her around for a while ? " Cleveland asked . " I had just a couple of dates with her . Come to find out I could n't stand her . " " That 's the way it was ? " Cleveland said , not quite asking . " That 's the way it was . " " Thanks for telling us . " " I said that 's the way it was . What do you expect of a Collings-worth ? " " Honesty . " " Shit ! " The blood rose in Kilmer 's face . Cleveland imagined that if Kilmer had any expression other than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Screwy honesty , if you can say that much for it . Tate will learn better , I hope . Right now he turns down most of the news the Legion gives him . " " Let the Legion do something . He 'll report it . "  | Kilmer seemed to consider before he asked , " Just what do you mean by that ? " " I 've seen some of your so-called news . I even ran some of it , but only to fill up the page and keep you off my neck . " Cleveland poured himself another drink and saw that his hand was steady . " You want the Advocate to reprint the witch-hunting stuff you read in the rags you subscribe to . As a professional man you ought to know it 's not news . " Doc Crabtree got in , " Dickens says the law is an ass . " Kilmer ignored the remark , saying to Cleveland , " I never heard you talk this way before . " " Never did , before I signed my declaration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Independence of what ? " " Of corsets . Of corsets and stays , " Cleveland answered and felt so pleased with his impromptu reply that he decided to embroider it . He took a breath , feeling most of it go to his belt level . Age made for short-windedness . " Never told you before , but I was born in Russia . Great friend of young Tzar Nicholas . Used to skate with him . That was before the revolution , of course . " " Funny , funny . And then you helped overthrow him , I sup-pose ? " " Sure . My real sympathy was with the masses . " " Quit it ! Goddamn it , Cleveland , you 're just leading me on . " The tone of the orator came into his voice . " You know I stand for a loyal and enduring America , for my country and tried and true principles , just as you do . " Cleveland looked at Kilmer , knowing he could never penetrate that dedicated , casehardened skull . " Strange to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Then let up on that pink stuff . Quit talking that fake bolshevik talk . " Cleveland got up slowly , somehow feeling both tranquil and sour . He said to Crabtree , " Let 's move to another table , Doc . I just ca n't seem to piss red , white and blue . "  | THE WIND WAS BLOWING , so hard that a man , driving , kept having to fight it . Firm hand on the tiller against the push of the tide , quick hand against the blind , rocking waves . It was cold , too , as cold , an old-timer had said , as a western wind ever got . The cold squeezed in through door frames and drove up from the floor . No frost on the windshield , though , not in this dry , speeding air . The wind swept tumbleweeds over the road . The weeds charged the car , clawing for entrance . Ben glanced at Mattie and said , " I feel like a tumbleweed myself . " " It 's not far now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the spirit that disregarded the weather . As she had come to the car , dressed rather lightly , weather considered , the wind had attacked her , blowing her hair wild , clamping her clothes against the hollows and curves of her body , and , with the close of the door , she had laughed as if somehow exultant . She sat beside him now , a robe over her lap and knees , as serene as the weather was not . True daughter of Montana . No matter some grumbling , what was storm but a change of the seasons , to be expected and stood against ? What was distance ? Montanans climbed in their cars and took off , sure of themselves though arrival might be unsure . Freighters , wagon drivers , horse riders at heart if unknowingly , they regarded machines as old ones had regarded their animals . All distances could be tackled , all weather challenged , even if sheepherders had been known to perish in blizzards . Good men , they stayed with the sheep , did n't they ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valley lay down from them to the left , the windswept valley , barren of the last leaf . The wild tan grasses ran with the wind . Beyond the mountains white wind clouds , unmoving themselves , sent their wild forces , like headquarters generals . But below were houses that stood fast and people not prey to dismay . The bench streamed with weeds and dust from the fallow fields scattered in plots forsaken and ugly . It was hard to believe they would be reborn ever and stand rich with green and ripening grain . " Your mother will blow away , walking to the Collingsworths ' , " he said . " Do n't worry about Mother . She wo n't be worried herself . Right now she 's probably writing a composed little note , telling Ferd Montjoy how to warm up the stew . It 's not so far anyhow , and she may get a ride . " Mattie pointed ahead . " Turn right at the next corner , Ben . " The turn put the wind behind them , and the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be there ? " he asked . " In addition to us , I would imagine the Ewings . " " Mary Jess did n't tell me . " He could see Mary Jess again , standing there in the office , a seeming diffidence in her manner as she asked him to dinner . " Why , thanks . Of course , " he had said . " I wanted to ask you first . " " You have . I accept . " " What about Tuesday , then ? Wednesday and Thursday are our busy days . Friday or Saturday hardly suit Father . And ? " " Tuesday 's fine . " " And since I work just half time ? " Her grave eyes completed the question . " Half-time pay . Full-time work . I 'm going to see about that . Oh , you want Tuesday off ? " " Just the afternoon . " " rake the whole day . "  | " Maybe . And do you suppose you could run out and get Mr. Greenwood ? " " Glad to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busy . " She added without inflection or change of expression , " Why do n't you ask Mattie Murchison , Ben , if it happens that the date suits everybody ? She knows the way , and she 'll be invited , she and her mother . " So , he thought , if you ca n't have first choice , take second . Arguments both ways . The first was challenge , dreamed destination glimpsed from afar . The second was comfort , was ease . Toss a coin and look to see if it did n't come up Mary Jess . " Turn right again , " Mattie said . " You can see the place , there , with the trees . " " Good ranch ? " " Yes , but call it a farm . It 's irrigated . Mr. Greenwood rents it out , on shares I imagine , but lives in the house along with the couple that rent it . She cooks and watches out for him . " Ben braked to a halt in front of the house . A fading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered by storm sashes . A couple of cottonwoods and a tangled growth of willows , bare now and wind-bent , adorned the grounds . A solitary cow , brooding on the hard ways of nature , looked out of a barn door to the side and rear of the house . Chickens , if any , must have been blown to Dakota . " You stay here and keep warm , " Ben told Mattie . He opened the car door , careful lest the wind snatch it out of his hand and tear it loose from its hinges . He had to wrestle it closed . Mr. Greenwood met him at the door , a stooped figure in a long coat and a cap with ear flaps pulled down . The coat might have fit him before the years shrank him . He pulled off a mitten to shake hands . The hand seemed as fragile as ash . " Brother Tate , " he said , his voice sounding small in the wind . " How good of you to come for me . " The old eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the car ? Oh , Mattie , dear Mattie . " Ben took hold of his arm . If he lost his grip on it , he thought as they leaned into the wind , Mr. Greenwood would soar like a dis- carded page of the Advocate or roll like a tumbleweed . To shield him , Ben stepped a bit to the front , still holding his arm . On the way back to town , with three in the seat , Mattie was pressed close to him . He could feel the length of her upper arm and the touch of her thigh . It would be rudeness to inch away . Mary Jess opened the stove door . The three stuffed chickens were browning well . She basted them . Potatoes still to be mashed , molded salad , chocolate pie and whipped cream in the new electric icebox , peas in the pan to be heated , sweet potatoes baking , rolls ready for the oven , and oh , yes , the scalloped oysters , first of the season . Above the renewed hum of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to mood . Through the window the caragana hedge in the rear of the house looked forlorn , as if ready to lie down at last and let the wind have its will , and far beyond it rose Elephant Ear Butte , the indomitable upthrust , penetrator of the whipped sky . But the wood range had quit smoking and burned with a steady heat now . Thank heavens for two ovens , the just-bought natural gas one and the other in the old range that had been kept as accessory and , more important , as heater of the kitchen in winter in a house minus a furnace . She was getting some dirty utensils out of the way when her father came from the living room . " Anything I can do , dear ? " he asked , his small smile admitting there was n't . " Nothing , Father . The table 's all set , and I 'll have the food ready on time . You might see about the stoves , though , and be prepared to meet company . " Poor , helpless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withdrawn and solitary except in the presence of special company . Never quite the same , confirmed and advanced in retreat , since Mother had died bringing Charles into the world . The wind , it was always the wild wind that sang Mother 's last  | cries . " You take good care of your father , dear , " and " Oh , Benton , whatever will you do ? " A fine time to be heeding the wind , when she had to be composed , to make sure all was just right . A fine time to be thinking about pregnancy and the death that resulted . Both acts of nature . Acts of nature nothing . You did n't have to . No one commanded that you enter the valley of the shadow . For any reason , all righi , fear included , a woman could say , " Not for me . " She tested the boiling potatoes . Not ready quite yet . It was Father 's idea . It was Father 's party . And if Ben Tate came to think she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It had been a mistake even to go to the auction with him . Men imagined too much . People were too quick to make matches . Ben Tate and Mattie and Mrs. Anderson , and the Ewings , as well as old Mr. Greenwood ? they 'd be arriving before long . She would put them out of her mind , all of them , each and every one of them , while she concentrated on cooking , while she scorned the wind that tried in vain to thrust in . Soon enough Ben would find she was his employee and no more than that . She put her hand to her head . It must be the damned moon , her damned time of the damned moon . Pardon , Father . As she put the rolls in the oven , the doorbell rang and bright and hearty voices rose in helloes and how-are-yous , louder than refrigerator and wind . Mattie breezed into the kitchen . " Hi , Mary Jess . Where 's an apron ? Tell me where I can lend a hand . " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outward girl who might have been carried in by the wind . " Mattie , thanks . Everything 's about done . " She felt Mattie 's eyes on her . She felt Mattie 's hand on her arm . " Why , Mary Jess , " Mattie said , " no cause to get rattled about a little old meal . " Ben found himself seated between Mort and Mrs. Ewing ? Julie , everyone seemed to call her . Mr. Collingsworth sat at the  | head of the table with Mrs. Anderson on his right . Next to her was Mr. Greenwood and next to him Mattie . Mary Jess sat at the end of the table , when she did sit . She was forever going to the kitchen for more coffee , hot rolls , or other replenishments . She looked somewhat flushed , no doubt from her labors over the stove , and all the lovelier for it . He had n't met Mrs. Ewing before , at least not for more than a quick introduction . An extraordinary woman , he thought , glancing again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet , perhaps in her mid-thirties , younger than Mort , but did not seem too much younger , for Mort bore his years lightly . Ben mostly kept silent while the talk swung , rather idly , from mahjong , which was just catching on in Arfive , to Floyd Collins , dead in his cave in Kentucky , to last year 's presidential election . They were subjects old in the news . Let Ewing and Mr. Collingsworth , assisted by Mr. Greenwood , carry on . The ladies also seemed content just to listen . " Evolution and that Tennessee trial , " Mr. Collingsworth said when discussion lagged . Another stale topic by newspaper standards , Ben thought , if stale by only two or three months . Newspaper , even weeklies limited in scope and made tardy by periodicity , addressed themselves to the immediate and future . But communication was sketchy and slow in Montana , and events filed away elsewhere were still talked of here . " I was glad to see that trial come to an end , " Mr. Collingsworth said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " And that big bang of guilty came out just a squeak , " Ewing added . " William Jennings Bryan always was a fool , " Mr. Collingsworth said , not as if he expected dispute . " Anyone talks that much always shows up a fool , " Ewing told the table . " But , take it another way , silence do n't prove a turnip is smart . " He smiled . " Now , Prof , who said I was referrin ' to President Coolidge ? " " All the same , it is disturbing , " Mr. Collingsworth said as if uninterrupted . " These days are disturbing . People have lost  | faith , renounced old values . I do n't defend fundamentalism by any means . But I do think religion is important , and it 's losing out . " Mr. Greenwood put in , " Perhaps because the real truths of Jesus have been misinterpreted , ignored and distorted . " " Look at our young people . " Mr. Collingsworth shook his head . " They all chew gum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condemnation enough . " In public or private they chew it , but not in my classrooms , you can be sure . " " Give me a good chaw of tobacco anytime , " Ewing said . " Now , Mort . " It was Mrs. Ewing who spoke . " Do n't make light of it . " Mattie and Mary Jess were smiling at Mort . A grin touched Mr. Collingsworth 's mouth and disappeared . " Soon enough , youth will change , " Mr. Greenwood said , as if , reaching to the limit of memory , he could recall he was young once . " They 'll live through it , I suppose , " Mr. Collingsworth said , " but will the rest of us ? Rolled stockings , bare knees , face paint and bobbed hair . " " Oh , Mr. Collingsworth , " Julie Ewing said , pretending outrage , " you ca n't say you disapprove of shorter hair . I had my own cut . " " Yep , " Ewing said , his smile warm , " woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your everlasting mortification . " " Yep , again . Have n't showed my face since . " " At least , " Mattie said , speaking almost for the first time and shaking hair that fell well short of her neck line , " I had no one to mortify , not even Mother , who 's thinking she might do the same thing . It does save a lot of bother . " Mrs. Anderson accompanied her nod with , " It seems to make sense . " " I 've been thinking ? " Mary Jess said and looked at her father and let the sentence die . Her hair was coiled , beautifully , Ben thought , at the back of her head . He studied the two girls when they were n't looking . If either had used lipstick or rouge , it was so little as merely to enhance , not travesty , nature . Probably , for Mary Jess , the stove had brought color enough to her face . Largely silent , a little flushed , she was something to see and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and glanced away .  | " Ben , " Mattie said , catching the table 's attention , " you 've hardly said a word . Now what 's your opinion , about short skirts and short hair and makeup and all that ? Do you approve or not ? Speak out , boy . " Their scrutiny , their waiting , pressed on him . " I like a bit of decorum , " he managed to get out . " Quite a bit . " He cast around in his mind for something more . " As for the rest , well , I heard about a man who went to one of those psychoanalysts , and the psychoanalyst said , If I 'm right , your trouble is that you ca n't make up your mind . Is that so ? ' And the patient answered , Well , yes and no . ' " They were laughing when Mr. Greenwood broke in to say , as if his words were germane , " I believe in saying yes to life . Right , Brother Ewing ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some sort . Noes do n't germinate . " " What exasperates me most of all , " Mr. Collingsworth said , as though unwilling to let go of the subject he had brought up , " what is really irritating is not just the abandonment of good taste and good manners . It is the assumption of superior wisdom by the young . They know everything . No use to tell them that wisdom comes from hard thought and long experience . New knowledge , new insights , as well as discards and enforcements of old ways , they do n't burst forth . They 're not miraculous . They are the fruit of the years . " Mr. Greenwood said quietly , " There was Jesus . " No one answered . No one spoke at all . It was as if a hand had been clamped over discussion . Mattie broke the silence , her gaze on Ben . " What were you about to say ? " " Nothing at all . "  | " But you were . I could see it . After Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Nothing original . It 's been said before . " Mary Jess 's fine eyes came to him . " Ca n't you quote it ? " " All right . I forget the author , but he wrote , Nothing is so fatal to conversation as an authoritative utterance . ' " For an instant they seemed to think , and then they laughed , all of them except Mr. Collingsworth . That grin that transformed him , that changed his expression from sober to merry , came on his face . He said , " Good boy . " After they had finished dessert and the men , save Mr. Greenwood , had smoked in the living room while the women did up the dishes , Mrs. Anderson said , " I do hope you 'll excuse me . I must n't be late for my bridge club . " She looked toward Mattie and Ben . " Of course , Mother . And Mr. Greenwood ? " " We 'll drop him off , " Ewing said . " It 's no more'n two lopes away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned to Mrs. Ewing . " And besides that , it 's time we got back to the ranch , hopin ' Charlie and young Mort have n't burned down the house . " " That would be kind of you , Brother Ewing , " Mr. Greenwood said . They gave their thanks then and made more excuses , and Ben went along with Ewing to help old Mr. Greenwood into the Reo . The wind was a little less fierce . Taking Mattie and Mrs. Anderson to the car , Ben looked back and saw Mary Jess , framed in light , at the porch door . Mattie said , tugging , " Come along , Romeo . "  | BEN BRAKED his car in front of the Anderson house . " Are n't you coming in ? " Mattie asked before getting out . " It 's only a little after eight o'clock . Too early for me tonight . " " There ought to be a club for women , " she said . He felt obliged to ask , " Do you want to ride around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ben . " He took her to the door , their heads turned away from the wind , and , back in the car , set off for the center of town . But nix on a visit to the Club . There 'd be only talk there and a couple of drinks that would blur or distort the paths of memory and wish . And nix on the picture show , where he would see Jack Holt or Ken Maynard in something foreign to fact as well as counter to mood . Besides , it was too late for the opening scenes . Just drive around . Drive by the Collingsworth house and see a shadow in a lighted frame , hear the remembered voice . Drive around , while imagination bloomed . A man had a right to be foolish , if dreams and desire were foolish . The wind had renewed itself , if from harsh to harsher could be termed renewal . He felt its pushing hands on the Hupmobile and welcomed its strength as he defied it . In a certain mood a man was glad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shining bright and brave through the wind , and he found himself humming a new song , " Does your mother know you 're out , Cecilia ? " Cecilia was in , casting brief shadows against the blind of a lighted window . She was in and sheltered from storm , free of all but its cry . He turned around and drove back and saw old Mr. Mack and  | his dog , who might make it down the steps to the Club . Mr. Mack had a package , a fresh bottle , no doubt , in one hand . He stopped in front of Billie Gayle 's place and for a moment sat motionless , letting himself feel the good cold . He went in and asked for cigarettes and a near beer . No other customers , not in this weather . " Wind 's fierce , " he said to the misshapen face . He and Billie had come to good terms . " You learn to live with it , Ben . " The mouth had to take time with the words . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Hard to manage against it , " Ben said , not wanting to put the bald question . " No trouble , Ben . Living upstairs , I just have to make it from my outside door to the next . " The eyes in the crooked face were straight eyes , gentle but not wishful of help or of pity . Ben answered , " Fine , " stubbed his cigarette and gulped his beer . " I 'll see you , Billie . " A drive , a cigarette , an approach to beer ? and there was nothing else for him but home and bed . The post office , though . He walked to it in the wind , expecting nothing much except perhaps something locally posted , and found nothing . The house seemed empty when he entered , though Mattie would be somewhere around , perhaps preparing for bed or already in it . He went upstairs quietly . A bath and then a book , he thought . Work could wait till tomorrow . Bathed and dried , he put on pajamas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Fiction or exposition ? Nothing very new in his little collection of books . William Dean Howells ? No . Walter Hines Page ? No . Floyd Dell , the moon calf ? No . Not Sinclair Lewis tonight , either . But here was John Burroughs , kin to Thoreau . Here was The Summit of the Years , which was good on rereading . In bed , he was just starting the book , savoring , " The longer I live the more my mind dwells on the beauty and the wonder of the world , " when a bare rap came at the door .  | He sat up and said , " Come in . " What could Ferd Montjoy , the dried-up bookkeeper and pan player , be wanting ? The door opened quietly , revealing Mattie clothed in a dressing gown . " What 's wrong , Mattie ? " " Me . " She hesitated and then asked with a directness he had learned to expect , " Do you want to turn off the light and move over ? " He looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? the girl without secrets . " Do n't gasp . You have the right to refuse , " she said softly . He was numb , all of him but the rising eagerness under the blanket . It commanded him to turn off the light . For an instant , in the filtered moonlight , he saw her naked , the gown dropped , saw her naked , slim-waisted , fruitful-hipped , proud-breasted , the breasts somehow pitiful , enough to make the heart ache . No time for more talk . No time but for one thing . He felt the warmth of her , the dear femininity , and kissed her and mounted . It had been so long . One thrust , three , half-a-dozen ? and it burst in his mind as he was about to burst that people so blessed by sensation could ask nothing more . Let the climax of dying come with the climax of love . Like this . Like this . And then it was fading to after-beats , to cherished remembrances . For long minutes afterwards she lay next to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the hollow of his throat . The wind sang outside , the great , wild , seeking wind . And here , safe and completed , they rested . She said then , " I 'm not promiscuous , Ben . " She might have been talking to the room , to the moonlight . " A few things I do know . That 's one . Another is that I do n't want you to get that reputation . Are n't we taking a chance now ? " " Mother will call me when she 's ready to come home . Ferd will play pan until midnight at least . So it 's just us , and you wo n't talk . Not you , Ben Tate . Your reputation counts , too . " " At any rate I wo n't talk , except to rejoice to myself . "  | " I 've had plenty of opportunities , if you can call them that , " she said . " Earl Kilmer and Ferd have been trying for years . " " Kilmer 's married . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flag and the whole world of females . I refuse to be infiltrated by divided loyalty . " Her small laugh sounded wry . " And Ferd ? " " He would have entered it on his books under profit or loss , probably both for the sake of his balance sheet . " " I 'm the lucky one , then ? " " I had a good man once , Ben , " she said . " The only man , until you , who 's ever known me . He was a wonderful , thoughtful , kind husband , and he died in the service but not in combat . The damn flu killed him . That hellish flu . " " I 'm sorry , but you have n't explained about me . " " You 're a good man , too , Ben . That 's why I came to you , a hussy in the night . But let 's have one thing understood : I do n't love you , and you do n't love me . Right now I 'm your girl of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you asked me to marry you , thinking to play the gentleman , I would say never . Even if you imagined you loved me , the answer would still be the same . " " You do n't mean just this one time , this one time tonight , and never again ? " " I did n't say that . Biology is insistent . " " The old animal impulse . " " Do n't make it cheap . Say it 's impulse directed by discrimination . We 're friends in need , no more and no less than that . Call us prey to biology , but wary and selective prey . Careful , too , of getting our emotions involved . " He put up a hand and stroked her hair back from her forehead . She had a good brow . " All right , Mattie . Not love , but certainly liking . " She was such a nice girl , and nice girls came to a man only in dreams , girls somehow wonderfully innocent of commandments and warnings . The avowed code @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might think girls occupied a separate world and spoke a  | language different and esoteric . How often in uneasy sleep had he sought the good but compassionate girl who recognized and relieved his torment ! And how seldom had he found her , catching at the last only the far flutter of a skirt ! She stirred and said , " You have n't had much experience with women , Ben . Is n't that so ? " " Some . " " I would have thought those French girls ? " " I pretty well shied away from them . " " Afraid of women or of disease ? " " Both , I guess . Hell , I was a victim of Methodist morality . Still am , I suppose . Anyhow , I do n't like bought sex , and a trip to a prophylactic station was enough to chill me . " She patted his chest . " Ben , you do n't know a damn thing about making love . " " I 'm ready to try again . " " Not yet . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think how many marriages are spoiled by the men . " " How do you know ? " " I hear the girls talking . They do talk , you know . " " And tell the truth ? " " Oh , women are liars , one to another , but I 'm sure some of the truth is there . To a lot of them sex is a bore or worse . One told me ? and I believe her ? that she thought out her grocery list while submitting . " " Why fault the men ? I hear plenty of women are frigid . " " Mostly the result of men 's ignorance , young men 's in particular . Or of their indifference . One thing for sure , Ben , if you and Mary Jess are to be happily married , you have to learn a few things . " " I ca n't even date her . Talk about marriage ! " " Do n't get on the prod . You 'll be married . " " So teach me . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that took away any sting . " Write it in your skull that a woman is not just a railroad station , where you get on and get off . "  | " Play on words there . " " Smart boy . Men are all for satisfying themselves . If a wife happens to find enjoyment , I suppose there would n't be any objection , though that 's not the point of the exercise . True of you just a while ago , too . " " I 'm afraid you 're right . I took your reaction for granted , anyhow . But go on . " " Oh , hell , Ben , it sounds so damn clinical . It 'll forever cool you towards me . " " Let 's see . " " Did you know that suckling a baby gives a mother a sensual pleasure next door to sex or even closer ? " " You 've never had a baby . Oh , good God , Mattie , I never thought . I did n't take any precautions . Did you ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not planning to trap you . I ca n't have a baby . I 'm barren . Two doctors have said so , to the disappointment of my poor husband and me . " He did n't mean to sigh . He could n't say it was too bad , not now . He said , " Back to my instruction then , Mattie . " " I just told you a mother gets a sensual pleasure from suckling her baby . " " And I was about to ask how did you know . " She held up her answer and then said quietly , " It does n't have to be a baby , Ben . " " I see , " he said , wondering about what he did see . " And you do n't exactly abandon yourself when you kiss . " " Shall I practice ? " " Listen , instead . A woman needs preliminaries . She 's not as fast as a man . Damn again to this clinical stuff , but you wo n't learn it from preachers . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , except that they always seem to have plenty of kids . Hell , I was reared that way . Sex is nasty . " " You 'll think it nastier yet , what I have to tell you . " " Tell me and see , teacher . " " The teacher says a woman has a little , inside thing . Here , give me your hand . For goodness ' sake , it 's not perversion . "  | He gave her his hand . " There , " she said , guiding a finger . " There . Now gently , gently . Remember what else . " Of a sudden she clutched him and pulled him over to her spread thighs and steered him home and , thrust and thrust , and her body arched to him , and heels and hands pulled him deeper , and throat sounds came from her panting mouth . And then it was over , and she said , " There , Ben . " " Yes , " he said . " Yes and yes . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I must get dressed and be ready to go get Mother . " " Want me to go along ? Be glad to . " " Then I might be known as your girl , if not something more . " In the moonlight he watched her put on her robe , saw her cover the brave breasts , the slim waist , the pelvis over the shadowed triangle where he had just been . " See you , Ben , " she said as she closed the door . He asked , " Next Tuesday ? " knowing she could n't hear . He lay , listening to the wind , whither it bloweth , and it blew in Mary Jess . Bird in the hand . Bird in the bush .  | IN THESE DAYS just before Christmas it was cold , so cold that in windswept places the snow cried under heel like dormant life stepped on and , where drifted , crunched under foot . The air , if unstrained by cloth , bit at the lungs . The migrating geese had honked south long since , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Breast saw only stray magpies , stray chickadees and perhaps a horned owl , all of them hunched and forlorn as if , in short lifetimes , spring was too distant for hope . Ben walked in his heavy coat , overshoes , ear-flapped cap and gloves inside mittens , his nose and mouth covered with a muffler that froze with his breath . A cold time but a good one , he thought . A man rose to the weather . In it he proved his leather . Sunday , the day of rest , and the far sun shone , companioned by sundogs , and dazzled the eyes , and God looked on His work and called it good . What would Thoreau have said ? Or Walt Whitman ? Men of an older , gentler clime , as a poet had written ? The westwardlooking men , the westward-yearning , doomed never to see the West ? Would their prose have been finer had they known it , their songs more full-throated ? The answer had to be yes . Yes to the cold , yes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the numbed thicket and yes to the man alone . A good time , this , and a right day to rest , if walking were resting . The days in the office had merged into nights , and the office more often than not had led to the shop , where job work , private and county , had swamped Okay Myers . Stationery , business cards , invitations , dodgers for this and that , admission and membership tickets and official forms for the sheriff and clerk ? all  | these and more and the business of setting advertising and news type for the paper had been too much for one man , even with the limited help of a printer 's devil who happened to be his son . But thank the Lord for business , Ben thought , walking on . Thanks for job work and increased advertising . And thanks that he knew where to hang his own hat in a shop , how to set type by machine or hand , how to justify a page , how to operate presses . Hard on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bunch of mallards , seeing him , flew up and away from a short stretch of open water where the Breast proved there was life in it yet . Greenheads among them , maybe all greenheads , arrayed in advance for their spring courting . He watched them circle against the blued sky and moved away and saw them start to wing back . A long wait until mating if they only knew , but nature , knowing , could wait and prepare . Nature could wait ? with assistance on Tuesday nights . The assistance had become custom and a matter of almost week-long expectation , canceled just once by the regularity of Mattie 's rhythm . Tuesday was just two nights away . No good to think of that now . Think of the paper . Think of Mary Jess , promoted to full-time as she should have been earlier . With her help he was finding enough copy to fill up the news space and did n't have to plug holes with syndicate boiler plate . In time he could hope to discard another crutch ? newspaper stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the supplier pocketed the national-advertising returns . Some good historical stuff in those pages , though . No , he told himself , do n't think about Mary Jess . Put her out of mind . A man moonstruck was just half a man , reduced in independence and purpose . But she insisted on intrusion . She was at a dance she had let him take her to , graceful and female in spite of a shapeless , low-waisted dress , duplicate of those other young women wore , as if contours were deformities . She sat next to him at a picture show . She was across from him at Eva Fox 's table . She let him feel the bare touch of her lips in their quick goodnights . Competent , even gifted , she was working with him in the  | same office , as near as the next desk and as far away as the edge of the world . He shook his head against remembrance and daydream . He would go home now and shed his rough clothes and go out to eat , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would n't . The cluster of town a mile distant looked huddled , too , like the birds . Less than a mile , and a jack rabbit leaped up and loped off , a patch of snow moving on the unmoving snow . It could have stayed safe under its tangle of cinquefoil . Mattie met him at the door , on her face such an expression of strain that he said , " What ? " before she could speak . " Will your car start ? " " I can see . Why ? " " Please do . It 's for Mother . " He stepped inside and slammed the door against the cold clouding in . " Your mother ? " " Not her . It 's Mr. Greenwood . He 's dead . " " Dead ? I do n't see ? " " Found dead . By Mrs. Broquist . Nels drove a buggy to town . His phone would n't work . Car either . " " Wait , Mattie . Does Lawrence Chiles know , and Doc Crab-tree ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Then your mother ? ? " He let the question hang . " She insists on going out there . " She moved to him and took his arms in her hands , her face upturned . " She 's one of his oldest friends . Please , Ben . She has old ideas . " " Not to the point of laying him out ? " " Not quite . She thinks he would want company now . She 'll pick out his burial clothes . " " Where is she ? " " Getting ready . She 's bound to go somehow . " " Watch to see if the car starts . You 'll need blankets , your mother and you . " The sullen engine , disturbed in its hibernation , groaned over . It was too much for machines , this weather far below zero . It  | fired and died and fired and died again and at repeated rousings , began a hit-and-miss beat until finally all cylinders awakened . He got out and helped Mrs. Anderson in , and then Mattie . Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to perform , and she would perform it , and it struck him that women , most women , faced illness and death as men did n't and could n't . It was the impulse and compulsion of men to remove themselves from the sick and dead bed . Ben saw to it that the robes protected his passengers . There had been little traffic on the hill to the bench and little up on the flat , where snowdrifts occurred helter-skelter . He squinted against the bounce of the sun on the snow and heard Mattie say , " Here . " She took off one glove , poked in her purse , found a pair of dark glasses and fitted them on him . " All right ? " she asked . " Fine , but they 're not mine . I did n't have any . " " You do now . I was saving them for your Christmas stocking . " For thanks he reached over and patted the bare hand . He steered the car in the trail rutted out by the ambulance and arrived at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were entering . Chiles was carrying a folded litter . Mrs. Anderson hurried Mattie from her seat and marched to the door with Mattie following . Ben took time to lay one of the robes over the hood of the car . The engine would grow cold soon enough even so . The body of Mr. Greenwood lay on a couch , just as found , Ben supposed . A sheet had been drawn down to his waist . Doc Crabtree straightened up and , returning his stethoscope to his bag , shook his head . Mrs. Anderson , her fingers light on the old , dead face , was saying , " Nathaniel . " Mattie sat straight in a chair , her fair face blank , as if , like Mr. Greenwood , she had lost the capacity to feel . Mrs. Broquist , standing aside , said , " He liked to nap . I took it he was sleepin ' , you know , until ? " Broquist , near her , put in , " Then she called me , and I saw it was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . He uttered one word , almost under his breath . " Dignity . " " Then I drawn the sheet over him , " Broquist said . " Poor old feller . " Mrs. Anderson 's voice took on a soft sharpness . " He does n't want pity . That 's an affront . Yes , Nathaniel ? " Ben touched Mattie 's unmoving shoulder . There was nothing in him to say . Let others speak while he listened and looked . The Broquists , awkward now , two country people , probably second-generation Americans , the sturdy yeomen in fact . Lawrence Chiles with the lugubrious look of all undertakers when on scene . Doc Crabtree being Doc Crabtree . Mrs. Anderson comforting death . And Mr. Greenwood lying serene , his white beard fine and prophetic below the age-withered cheeks . " Can I take him now , Doctor ? " Chiles asked . " No , indeed . " Mrs. Anderson was speaking . " I must get out clothes suitable for the funeral . And look , Mattie . " She pointed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a brass clamp . " In there somewhere you 'll find the family history , date of birth , parents and all . I know he had no living relatives . " At Mattie 's look of loss , Ben unbuttoned his coat and took out some copy paper and a pencil . She moved to the table with them . Mrs. Anderson had gone into the next room , a bedroom presumably , directed there by Mrs. Broquist , who followed her . While they waited and Mattie took notes , Doc Crabtree said , " Just the burden of the years . It wears a man down , to the grave finally . But , not like most , there 's peace on this face or I never saw it . " " I should have thought of those vital statistics , " Chiles said . " With an old man like him , where else but in the family Bible ? " He sounded put out , perhaps because Mrs. Anderson had remembered . " Broquist , it 's near as cold in here as outside . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fire up . " Broquist gestured . " He do n't care . " Mattie had finished her note-taking by the time Mrs. Anderson and Mrs. Broquist returned carrying things . " Small clothes , "  | Mrs. Anderson said , laying articles on a chair as she inventoried . " His frock coat , and it 's clean . Shirt . Tie . His best trousers , matching the coat . And shoes . He always kept his shoes shined . Mrs. Broquist , please hand me the hangers and bag . " " You best leave the shoes , " Chiles said . " What ? " " It 's not customary . Besides , it would be a waste . " It took Mrs. Anderson a minute to understand . " It 's customary with him , I can tell you . Nathaniel would as soon be buried face down as without shoes . Right , Nathaniel ? I 'll see they 're put on myself if I have to . " Chiles said , " So be it , ma'am , " and beat a retreat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would imagine so . " Chiles began arranging the litter . Here , Ben thought , here at last was something to do , and he stepped forward , forestalling Broquist . With the litter arranged , they lifted the frail body to it and covered it with a sheet . Ben helped on the way to the ambulance , knowing at least one pair of eyes was on them . Once the body was inside , Chiles said , daring a smile as he faced away from the house , " Old boy 's light , is n't he ? Use the beard for a tail , and you could fly him like a kite . Now , Ben , I did n't mean anything . It 's just in my business a man 's got to keep his sense of humor . " Ben sidestepped and went back into the house and then helped with the little luggage and saw Mrs. Anderson and Mattie to the car . The quick winter night was falling as they rolled homeward . Into a long silence Mrs. Anderson said , " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and us . " " Why do n't you all come and eat with me somewhere ? " Ben asked . " Not at a time like this . Thanks . " After another silence Mattie leaned forward and spoke across Mrs. Anderson . " Yes , Ben ? Something troubling you ? "  | It was a part of intimacy , he supposed , a development from it , that she should know his humor and ask about it . " I was thinking about the obituary . I can write it , of course , the usual cut-anddried thing , but it ought to be by someone who knew him better . That 's what would be fitting . " Mrs. Anderson answered , " There 's Mort Ewing and ? " " No , Mother . Not Mort and not you , if you meant to suggest it . " That 's outlandish . " " I do n't think Mary Jess , " Ben said . " Too young really , to know him . " " That leaves Mr. Collingsworth . " Mattie added , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who I had in mind , " Mrs. Anderson said . " I , too , " Ben told them . " If he 'll do it . " Mattie said , " You can ask . " " All right . I 'll drop you off at the house , take your notes , Mattie , and run out there . " Mary Jess came to meet him . Through the glass he had seen her coming from the kitchen , an apron on . " Why , Ben , " she said , " come in out of the cold . Stay for dinner ? " " Thanks , no , Mary Jess . I 'm not riding the grub-line tonight . You know about Mr. Greenwood ? This time it 's your father I want to see . " " Yes . We heard earlier . Father 's in the living room . " Mr. Collingsworth put down a book as they entered . It joined a pile of other books on a library table . " Welcome , Ben , " he said , rising . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay . " " Sit down , anyhow . No purpose in standing . " The smile on Mr. Collingsworth 's face went away , leaving it darkly sober as usual . On his feet he wore congress gaiters and over his shirt an old smoking jacket . " It 's about Mr. Greenwood . " " Yes , " Mr. Collingsworth said , nodding his head . " A sad thing . "  | " I want to impose on you , Mr. Collingsworth . " " Oh ? " " Would you write his obituary for the paper ? " Mr. Collingsworth looked down at his folded hands . " I dislike to refuse you , Ben , but ? " " You 've known him a long time . You could do him justice ? you alone , Mr. Collingsworth . Please . " " I would offend the newspaper rule of objectivity . " " I would hope so . " Mr. Collingsworth kept studying his hands . After a while he said , " A man of gentle righteousness , " and Ben felt sure he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drew off a glove and reached in his pocket . " I have some biographical notes , taken from the family Bible . Here . " Mr. Collingsworth took them absently , hardly raising his eyes . " I 'm ever so grateful , " Ben said . It seemed best to go before time brought a change of mind , and he turned and almost collided with Mary Jess , who stood silent at the dining-room entry . On his way out , he heard Mr. Collingsworth saying , " Gentle righteousness . " Mary Jess stepped out on the chill porch with him , half-closing the door behind her . She gave him her quick kiss , and , for the first time , he felt her back tremble under his bare hand . Well , it was cold enough to make anyone shake .  | WITH A CHINOOK WIND breathing out of the west , the car would run again . Cleveland waited until the engine worked evenly . That was the way of weather in Montana , a day or a week or two weeks so cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life , all appendages numbed and shrunken to the little stove of his guts , and then a time so breezily balmy that fingers and feet found themselves , and the man could almost hear the spring birds . It was at times like today , Cleveland thought , that he knew why he had settled and stayed in Montana . A land without seasons would taste flat . No seasons , no seasoning . Which was a way of saying that good and bad existed only by contrast , dependent one on the other for appreciation and name . He put the Velie in low gear and let it growl along . Pursue that value-by-contrast idea , and it gave value to sinners , for what was virtue without its opposite ? What was sobriety if no man took a drink ? Too early yet for a drink , though , except for the one he had taken to start off the day . A man in retirement had to watch out , else boredom intensified and extended his drinking hours from get-up to good-night . Off to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as close as his hand and , hanging low and beyond them , hovered the dark clouds , senders of the chinook . More bad weather was coming , of course , for February was a notional month , not to mention March , April and even May . But today was today , and he should feel content to let the grass think of growing . The streets were slushy , and water ran on the inclines , but tllc  | sidewalks were bare . Chalk one up for progress ? sidewalks . When , long ago , he had courted his wife , more than once he had gone to her house wearing gum boots . Muddy teams and saddle horses had stood at the hitching racks then , and now just one rack remained and it on a side street and seldom used . The fragrance of horse manure had given way to the stink of exhausts . And was that progress ? " Skunk wagons , " the old Indians , themselves smelling of willow smoke , had called automobiles . He had been part of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the rule of things , and he had had no choice and now was just indulging an old man 's regrets . Look on the bright side . Natural gas to cook and heat by . Reliable electric lights to read by . More than hit-and-miss telephone service . Two dairies , a creamery , and milk , for those who liked milk , available bottled , whereas , not so long ago , a mother and cook had had to use the canned stuff or rely on a neighbor who kept a cow , and a child of the house had gone to get it carrying an empty lard pail . All these and more on the bright side , and all encouraged and supported by him as Advocate editor . He drove around the block and parked his car in front of the Advocate office . Mostly he had stayed away , not wanting to intrude , wanting to break out of old habit and adjust to the habit of nothing . Ben Tate met him with a smile and , rising , told him to take his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Cleveland asked as he sat down and took out a cigar . " She 's gone to the courthouse . " " Pity I never had a good-looking girl in the office . " A look came to Ben 's face , a faraway look if you could classify looks . " Competent , too , " he said , as if just recalling that quality . " Sure . What 's going on , Ben ? Funny for me to have to ask that . " " Not much besides job work . Plenty of it . " " Good . " Cleveland lit his cigar . " But I always said it was a shame to man and God that a country paper could n't make out on  | its own , independent of the damn shop . " He blew smoke at the ceiling and added what Ben surely knew . " Of course , it kind of evens up . No paper , no county printing under the law , and the shop would lose out on job work . But still I say it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All this fool maundering , this taking the time of a busy man who had a half-typed sheet in his typewriter . To hell with it . Before he could get up , Ben said , gesturing toward loose pages on his desk , " The Legion 's bringing in a speaker , nationally known and high-powered , so Earl Kilmer says . Two weeks from yesterday , and he 'd like two front-page stories , this week and next . There 's the stuff on the man . " " Ever hear of him ? " " No . His name 's Mark McBride . You ever heard ? " " No . " " Plenty of recommendations by civic groups here and there . " " One thing for certain , the flag will fly on God 's mast . " " So let him speak . I 'll run the stories . It does n't matter . " Cleveland rose from his chair now . " Free speech , free press , yes , Ben . Being free , though , we have to make sure we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to smile , at himself and at the look on Ben 's face . " Whatever that means . " He stepped to the door , said , " So long , " and went out . Nothing to do . That was the hell of having nothing to do ? nothing to do . Picking his way through the graveled slush , he walked across the street and leaned against the wall of the Arfive House . Here was what old men did when the weather was nice ? they backed up to a wall and watched cars and people go by . Here was their goodbye , watching things go by . And if the old men found a projecting column or corner or door frame , they leaned against it and stropped their backs , for the years had made their skins itchy . When two or more of them met , they talked of nothing while they soaked up the weather and subtracted these minutes from the small total left them . Change came to a town almost unnoticed , until a man cast  | back and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a family move to another location , all were noted , regretted or met with indifference , but seldom summed up . People came and went . The ways of life shed them . The body of the town acquired a new skin , like a snake , but was unconscious of it . Not so long ago he would have seen Jay Ross or Merc Marsh or Fatty Adlam or Nick Brudd or Hank Howie , good men and bad , and all dead and gone or simply gone now . Even their names were growing dim even to those who had known them , family names with no families to claim them , for time had sent their young away , too . Mary Jess Collingsworth was walking on the other side of the street , head up , step precise , destination in mind . Destination : Advocate office . Neat girl , Mary Jess . If Ben Tate did n't have an eye for her , he stood in need of a white cane . She gave a little wave and went on . Peter Sears passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his salesman 's bright , " Fine day , Mr. Mack , " Cleveland grunted a greeting . Up the street Billie Gayle stood crippled at the door of his place , smelling the fresh air , if the sense of smell had been given him . And here came Mattie Murchison , striding a good , natural stride , unfettered by notions of how a woman should walk . She stopped and asked , " How are you , Mr. Mack ? " " Better than I deserve . You playing hooky from the office ? Say , what 's the matter ? " " I worked through the noon hour . " The words came quietly , but the face was flushed and the blue eyes had the held gleam of anger . Abruptly she said , " Would you have a cup of coffee with me , Mr. Mack ? " " I 'd like the company , but coffee ? " A further look at her led him to say , " You want someone to talk to . Anyone , huh ? " " Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , but you 'll do . Please . " He heard a whining moan and , glancing across the street , saw his dog , the anxious head of his dog raised to the half-opened window of his car . He gave it what was meant to be a reassuring hand signal .  | The Arfive House dining room , which had a poor patronage at the best of times , had none at all now . Cleveland ordered coffee for two and , at Mattie 's refusal , a single doughnut . " You ? A doughnut ? " she asked with a lift of her eyes . " Wait and see . And wait on your talk . " He took the doughnut after it and the coffee arrived and said , " A man 's got to tend to dumb animals . " He excused himself and carried it over to the dog . More than the doughnut the dog seemed to appreciate a couple of pats on the head . Seated in the restaurant again , Cleveland said , " Out with it , Mattie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can , though a highball would help . " " The will has n't been filed , but I 've seen it . Except for a thousand dollars to the Broquists , Mr. Greenwood left Mother all that he had . " " Farm included ? " " Yes , and about three thousand dollars in cash . You know he did n't have any expenses to speak of . " " Good for him . " " I wish it would n't get known . " " Why , Mattie ? " " Because people are so suspicious . They 'll say there 's more here than meets the eye . That 's what they 'll say , and no basis for it whatever . I wish the paper ? " She did n't need to finish the sentence . " Now look here , Mattie . It 's damn rare and only in mighty big or contested cases that the paper prints how a man left his property . " " The farm would show up in the report of deeds and transfers , would n't it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here 's your mother , a fine , by-God woman , respected all around in spite of the tough times she 's had . I know about them . Oldest friend Mr. Greenwood had , probably , and he without kith or kin . Who ? whom , Mattie ? would he leave his estate to except to his old , thoughtful friend ? To a stranger ? To an enemy ? To God Almighty , Who has more than He needs ? "  | She managed to smile and said , " Go on , Mr. Mack . " " I can understand , having no relatives myself . I know your mother . In the old days , best forgotten , she never turned her head away from me the way a lot of Christly people did . Gossip ca n't hurt her . Let ' em talk . " " I suppose you 're right . " " And look again . It 's what a paper suppresses that gets talked about most , and talked about wilder and crazier and longer than it would be if revealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was involved in and that I wanted to be over and done with , I would say , Print it . ' " She took a sip of her coffee and put the cup down and gazed at him , and the glint of anger was still in her eyes . He said , " That 's not really it , is it , Mattie ? " " Fools ! " she burst out . " Fools ! I hate all fools . " " That gives you a wide range . Worldwide . It must be there 's an immediate fool who put you on the warpath . Or do n't you want to say ? " While she considered , he studied her . A damn good-looking girl with her honest face and fair hair , and , like Mary Jess , a good girl besides . Maybe a year or so too old for Ben Tate and by all accounts not interested in marriage , either , but any man would take more than one look at her . " It 's Jim Quinn , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the office with him . I wish he 'd go to the devil . " " Jim Quinn , " he answered . " Uh-huh . " " You know what he 's like . " Her eyes asked him to say . " Yep . Bottled-in-bond American . Maybe stronger than that . I guess , like Earl Kilmer , he would test one hundred and fifty proof . " " Along with Earl and a few others with Earl as their leader . " " So ? " he said , sure that she would go on . " It involves old Mr. Greenwood again . It came up over him ? I mean , the dispute . " " For an old man dead and buried , he seems pretty live . " " Do n't try to be funny . " " For God 's sake , Mattie ! "  | " I 'm sorry . It was that obituary , printed days ago , that set him off . Especially that description that called Mr. Greenwood a man of gentle righteousness . He 's hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " And you gave him what-for.Hot against whom , Mattie ? " " I do n't know , Mr. Mack . First of all that the words should be printed at all , I suppose . Then maybe Ben , though Ben was n't the author . " " I did n't think so . Give me one guess , and I 'd say Mr. Collingsworth . " " It was . I know that for sure . Ben asked him . " " How many know it was Collingsworth ? " " It ca n't be much of a secret . " She put her hands to her face and interrupted herself with , " Poor Mr. Greenwood . Gently righteous he was . " " No argument there . " She put her hands in front of her , then remembered her coffee and , after sipping , sat straight . " If Ben got compliments on that obituary ? and I 'm sure he did ? he would n't claim credit . He 's not that kind of a man . He 'd name the author . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 'd take the blame . You must not know him very well , Mr. Mack . " " Just wanted a second for my motion . Now , hell , forget it , girl . You 're outnumbered as against fools . " " But that 's not all . Jim Quinn said , with a kind of sly and devilish glee , that the Legion was bringing in a speaker . " " So it is . He did n't reveal more than that ? " " He left the rest to my imagination . Anyhow , I took off . I did n't want to hear anymore . " Cleveland sighed and thought about a drink . It was high time for one . He patted Mattie on the hand and said , " Now you 've got that off your chest , feeling better ? " " Believe me , I am . And thanks , Mr. Mack . It 's a relief , having you to talk to . " She did look better , he thought , not so flushed , not so stormyeyed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time for the Club . "  | As they rose , he touched her arm to add , " Be of cheer , girl . Not many things are really worth fuming about . Whatever comes , it 'll blow over . I promise you it will blow over . " Slushing across the street to get his dog , he heard the echo of his last words . It would blow over , he had told her . Yeah . Everything blew over ? given enough time . He guessed he still had connections enough to get a line on one Mark McBride.  | " I DO N'T LIKE this parking , Ben . It 's cheap . We 're not highschoolers . " " But how , then , do I see you alone ? " " You see enough of me , at the office and at home , " Mary Jess answered . " You call that private ? At your house your father is always around ? he or Charles , or both of them . " " It 's their home , too . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glad to have them there when I call on you . " To answer honestly would be to agree , if not wholly . She would not admit to the unbidden impulses , the sudden wishes , she had to fight against . She kept silent . They were parked on a rough country road that skirted the flank of Breast Butte . Below them lay the town with its sprinkle of lights and to the west shone the faint , goodnight gleam of the sun . " The days are getting longer , " she said . " Every evening after the solstice I mark the sunsets . The mountains make a good yardstick . " He moved closer to her , saying , " You 're just putting conversation in the way of the real subject . Now , look here , Mary Jess , you know I love you . I 've said it over and over . You know I want us to get married . " " Yes , Ben , and I 'm complimented , but suppose I do n't want to talk about that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're enjoying a false spring . February can turn brutal . " " And suppose I want to talk about you and me . We 'd make a fine team , in our private lives and in business . Ca n't you see what  | we could make of the paper ? Ca n't you see the town and country grow and us helping it grow , us having a hand in the shaping of it ? I can picture a healthy and prosperous community , land put to use that 's of little use now . Think what a dam on the Breast River would mean ? " " The old garden idea , Ben . I shrink from it . " " Why ? " ? " There used to be a slough on the edge of town , and there were frogs and garter snakes and minnows in it . I fished for the minnows with bent pins . " " I 'm surprised you came that close to nature . " He allowed her time for the implication and then added , " But that 's off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slough , but the town cemented it over and now pumps its water to the tank up on the hill . That 's a gain , I suppose ? " He put an arm across her shoulder , and she let it rest there , resisting its pull . " The town has water at least , " he said . " And in the daytime , looking down from here , you can still see buffalo grass and wild growth waving and maybe a prairie-chicken hen and her brood . In time , I 'm afraid , they 'll all go the way of the buffalo that used to graze there . " " So what ? Old things do go away . They must when they stand in the way of men 's needs . You would n't put a stop to progress if you could . " " I wonder . Anyhow , I feel set against change . I would cry for what went away . That 's a reason we would n't make a good team . " " Nonsense . We 'd have balance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governor , that 's what you would be . " His arm increased its pressure , and a wayward excitement rose in her . " Is it , " he asked with a quiet , upsetting humility , " that I 'm not the right man ? " But he was the right man if there was one , if there ever could be one . What more than he was could a woman ask ? A sudden demand of honesty , a sudden sense of unworthiness , made her say , " I do love you , Ben . "  | She heard his quick intake of breath . He said , " I want to jump out of the car and yell hurrah to the sky . " Instead , he seized her , and his mouth found hers , and she felt his hand sliding toward her waiting breast and on her thigh the hard , male thrust of him , and she squirmed and cried into his mouth , " No , Ben ! Please ! " Even as she spoke she came to wonder whether she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love and its sequel . Once she had wrenched free , he said , his breath fast , " All right , honey . But if we 're agreed on marriage , please set the date and set it soon . " " I 'll do my best , but be patient , Ben . " One thing more she must say , and she said it in a voice that made itself small . " It 's just I 'm afraid , Ben . I 'm afraid . " It was out then , it was acknowledged and faced , this fear that rode her . " For goodness ' sake ? " he began . " Do n't ask me why . Do n't ask me what . Please , just start the car . " I warned you I 'd be late , " Mattie said as she slipped off her robe and let it drop to the floor . Getting ready for bed , lying in it , Ben had been divided in mind . Did he or did n't he want her tonight , hardly an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or should n't he ? Now , as he glimpsed her outline in the dark of the room and saw the well-set head , the good breasts and the thighs that had delighted and comforted him , his body erased the doubt . " I have n't been waiting long , " he said . " Come to bed . " She stretched out beside him , saying , " It will have to be a short session . " " Devoted to business . " " What else ? " He made haste with her , more haste than time demanded , knowing he was less than a satisfactory lover . A man with a woman ought to be single in purpose , intent on the one act , not weakened and hurried by contemplations beyond the limits of bcd.  | But she seemed not to mind . She lay largely passive , as if distracted herself . At least , he thought and rejected the thought as crude and unworthy , by this act he had rid himself of the stone ache . Mary Jess could have no idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . Afterwards , resting beside him , Mattie said , " There are things ahead of you , Ben . " " I would hope so . " " Not that kind of things . " " Name a few . " " You 'd better be prepared for fireworks when that speaker comes to town next week . The Legion , or those men who maneuver it , have plastered the town with posters . " " Sure . I printed them for them . " " Well , look out . What if you are a target ? " " What if I am ? People are n't taken in by the likes of those men . " Wait till the speaking . " " You scare me . Now , what 's next , what dreadful thing ? " " This household is about to break up , and the good thing you had on the side will be gone . " " Wait . What do you mean ? " " I mean me . I 'm leaving town . " He had to think before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure ? " " It 's like this . Mr. Greenwood left his farm to Mother . She 's moving out there . She likes the country , and besides ? Ben , can I tell you something ? " " Anything , private or public . " " Quite private . It explains Mother , Ben . I 'm a bastard . " " Nobody better say so . " But did she mean what she said ? " But I am . A true and literal bastard and glad of it . " She paused and put in , " I do n't know why I 'm telling you all this unless it 's because we 've made love and I trust you and wo n't be seeing you very much longer . " He said , " Thank you , Mattie ? for all but the last . "  | " My reputed father was a drunk , a whorer , a brawler , a wifebeater . Name the worst , and you have him . He got shot while Mother was carrying me , but I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot himself , by accident . Shot most of his head off . He was drunk and went hunting and crawled through a wire fence and tried to pull his shotgun through after him . It had the good sense to go off . " He said , " Yes , " and waited . " Before his death Mother had wanted a child , but not by him certainly . More and more she wanted it , and finally she decided to have an illegitimate one . It stood a better chance , it could hold its head higher than any product of his . I suppose you can guess the rest . " " I ca n't believe what I 'm guessing . " " All the same , she chose Mr. Greenwood , or they got together somehow , by design plus love or whatever . Who knows the all of it ? Mr. Greenwood was already a widower . " " And your mother told you ? " " Yes . She wanted me to be proud of my parentage , even if half of it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she figured , than to think my father was a damn scoundrel . " " And Mr. Greenwood ? Did he know ? " " She never told him , and I did n't , of course . She may have thought that the burdens of a true Christian were already heavy enough . " Mattie spoke without disparagement . " She would n't have wanted to add to there . " " Knowing this much about your mother , I can begin to account for you , Mattie . " " Not the baby part . I do n't want one . " " And you do n't need to worry , one way or the other . " She was silent , and he had time to wonder what would happen to reputations if the public knew . Where would go the esteem in which Mrs. Anderson was held ? Where the gentle righteousness of Mr. Greenwood ? They should n't be altered one damn bit , but they would be . Secrecy here ruled out revelation .  | " Strange they never got married , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage to her would demean him , considering the kind of man she had lived with . Or maybe the fires , if there were any , went out . Or maybe he wanted to remain single-minded in his devotions . At any rate they remained good and close friends , no doubt remembering . " " All right , then . Let 's get back to the subject . The household is breaking up , but why must you leave ? " " Mother 's independent enough now , and I 'm not going to rattle around and grow old in a small town . " " You 'd better think about it , Mattie . The town 's not so bad , and , besides , where would you go ? What would you do ? " " To Minneapolis , where some relatives live . And I can do more than you know . I 'm not just a secretary . I 'm trained as a legal secretary , too , and I can keep books . " " I do n't want you to leave , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet . After your marriage you would n't be comfortable with me still in town . " His hand stroked her flank , enjoying the sleek nakedness of it , and he felt the beginnings of renewed desire , but she took the hand away and held it in both of her own . " Ben , " she asked , " has Mary Jess consented to marry you ? " " Well , yes . " " Good . Make it soon for the sake of you both . " " She has n't consented to the point of setting a date . " " Nevertheless ? " she began . Then she said , " You were n't very ardent tonight , were you ? You did n't want me very much ? " " That 's not true . " " Yes , Ben . You 're engaged , and you 're feeling disloyal and guilty . Tell me the truth . " " A little , then . " She moved away from him . " I know , Ben . I know you . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat on the edge of the bed and groped for her robe . " Do n't finish the sentence , Ben . It has no right ending , not for you . I understand . " She added quietly in what could have been  | pity or acceptance , " It 's no use to tell you that an engagement is not a vow of fidelity . No use , Ben . " With her robe on , she stooped and kissed him lightly . He tried to hold her , but she pushed his arms back . " Please , Mattie , " he said , " please do n't go . " She stepped away and put her hand on the knob and turned back to say , still in that quiet tone , " You wo n't have to feel ashamed again ? not because of me , Ben . " He saw her shape in the darkness , saw her go out and heard the door close gently but firmly , as firmly , he thought , as any door ever closed .  | FEBRUARY WEATHER , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best compared to a woman who was all warm compliance one day and all frosty rejection the next . Today was its day of frigidity ? ten below , his thermometer said ? and his car would n't start , and he had to go to that speaking tonight . He could stay home and no one would fault him , but , damn it , he had to go . Blame Mattie Murchison for that , Mattie and his vague suspicion of mischief afoot . He sat in his easy chair , a drink and a bottle beside him , and looked out the window into the gray twilight and thought it was a good time to die but a bad time to be buried . A man laid away would n't be pushing up daisies soon , not with the sod snowcovered and frozen stiffer than the corpse it would receive . The sum of cheer was that the wind was n't blowing . Mag came in from the kitchen , saw him lifting his glass and said , " You hardly ate at all tonight , and now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Drink and think , " he answered . " It 's food that would addle my brains . " " Humph . And curdle your liver . " That said , she withdrew , and he felt a mean sense of victory in this open defiance of her objections to his nursing a bottle at home . He had another bottle in his clothes closet if she only knew it . " Damn you , Bluster , " he said to the dog that lay at his feet . " I wish you 'd control your wind or anyhow sweeten it . " He lit a cigar . The dog did n't even wiggle an ear . A drink and a smoke . It had come down to that ? which was  | better than nothing . But where were the old days of the young nights , of music and fragrances and girls , the eternal wonder , the eternal promise ? Eroded , worn away , shriveled along with his balls . Still , there was hope for virility , if a man could believe the official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new-fangled wailer , the saxophone , and rediscover concupiscence . Right there ? his eyes went to the pile of newspapers stacked at his side ? right there it said the City of Washington had declared any sax music immoral . No mention of the violin and Fritz Kreisler , who were a better bet to put lead in your pencil . He filled his glass and knew he was filling in time , diverting his mind from his major concern . Something did n't smell right about that meeting tonight . Some stink was in the wind , some odor different from the patriotic bullshit the speaker 's title suggested . " America Evermore . " And where was the dope on the speaker , this Major Mark McBride , about whom he 'd asked in a telegram ? Bill Scobee , living on his pension in Washington , should have answered already . A man 's service record could n't be that hard to dig out , not hard at all for a man who had been a general . And now it was too late to turn to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call , Cleveland got up , went to the phone and got hold of Pinkie Adams at the Great Northern station . " Cleveland , " he said . " Any wires for me , Pinkie ? " " Nope . Might as well say Western Union 's gone out of business , Mr. Mack . Say , if one comes , you want I should deliver it in person ? " " It depends . I 'm going to that speaking tonight . " " Be glad to , Mr. Mack . Your home or the auditorium , either , you being an old friend and anxious , I know , to hear . " " Thank you , Pinkie . " Cleveland went back to his chair , stretched to turn on a light and finished his drink . Why all this damned foolish concern , he asked himself ? Why nag himself into going ? He had listened to enough speeches , by windy politicians , flag-wavers and oracular  | Prohibitionists . And why walk , when Ben Tate or any number of others would pick him up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would walk . He was man enough yet . The late light had surrendered to dark , gray dark , if a man could see out . Later the stars might shine , distant beyond the stretch of the mind , frosty as eternal indifference , but now the night brooded in a smother of cold . Six blocks to the high-school auditorium , a little less by the shortcuts . Just six blocks . Christ , in days gone by he could have hopped there in his shirt sleeves and arrived with breath in his lungs and warmth in his body . That was where a man noticed age first ? in his footing . Once , asking no recognition , his legs had carried him gaily : nowadays their joints creaked , and their muscles prayed for relief after a minute of exercise . Then the lungs atrophied , and any day the heart might ask what was the use . But , by God , he would walk ! " Daniel Webster , " he said to the sleeping dog , " sink or swim , live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand and heart to this vote . " Time to go , with allowance for a short drink . After swallowing it , he went to the corner of the room where the hatrack and his overshoes stood , sat down and began buckling the overshoes on . How much of a man 's life went into buckling and unbuckling , buttoning and unbuttoning ? Brushing teeth if he had them , going to the bathroom , bathing , changing clothes ? A by-Christ weary routine . He stood up , blowing , and put on muffler and overcoat and was about to clamp on ear pads and hat when Mag came out of her room to see he was togged out all right . " I am going to take a walk , Mag , " he told her . " Dog , too ? " " I do n't know ? ? " " He 'll cry all the time you are gone , you know that . " " Up , Bluster ! " he called . " Come on , you wind-breaking hound . Oh , here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character . They 'll let you in . And if I can stir my stumps , so can you . " The clog could n't hear much anymore . He gazed up sadly .  | " I 'm not bound for the Club , Mag . I 'm going to enjoy oratory . " She did n't believe him , and he could n't blame her . On a sudden , fool impulse he kissed her wrinkled forehead , then saw tears coming to the old eyes . " Goodbye , " he said . " Back soon . Goodbye . " He pushed the dog out with his foot and closed the door behind him . Outside , the air burned his nostrils and lungs . A cold fury , he thought , taking some credit for a fresh use of an old phrase . Unaided by wind , it thrust its dead fingers into his clothes . The night was still , frozen motionless , its breath locked . His own puffs of breath bloomed white before him . He held up while the dog , barely able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , picking his steps in the churned and trodden snow and damning the muscles that had started to ache . Had he chosen another way , a car might have picked him up , but there was no hope for a lift on these side streets and shortcuts . Hurrah for his choice , then . He was a little more than halfway to the school when he heard crying whimpers behind him . There was Bluster , down in the snow , scrambling and failing to get his legs under him . Cleveland walked back , saying , " You poor old son of a bitch . " He set the dog upright , positioning his legs and , watching , took a few steps away . The dog tried to follow but went down again . " Oh , Christ ! " Cleveland said on his return . " Mean I have to carry you when I can hardly carry myself ? " The dog 's sad eyes apologized . Cleveland cradled the dog in one arm . Fifteen more pounds , then , and almost half the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ache in his legs to ease up . Mind over matter , and how a man felt was determined by thought . The fool dog tried to lick his face . Here were the steps to the entry at last , and Cleveland paused and panted , wondering whether his legs would lift him in . " Trouble , Mr. Mack ? " Brobeck asked .  | " No . I made it , did n't I ? " " Sure , you did , Mr. Mack , but it looks like your dog did n't . Here , give him to me . " There could n't be a look of concern on Brobeck 's seamed face . He took the dog and moved aside to let people pass . Cleveland unbuttoned his overcoat . Christ , he was hot , cold out or not , hot and out of breath and ready to drop . He felt a tug on his arm . " Here you are , Mr. Mack , " Pinkie Adams was saying . " Western Union and yours truly on the job . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and stuffed the telegram in his suit pocket . " Wo n't hurt to blow a little , " Brobeck said , still with a sort of asking look in his face . " I feel kind of winded myself . " After a minute or two he added , " Ready now ? " Brobeck found a seat for him in the front row near the exit , set the dog to one side , folded Cleveland 's overcoat , placed overcoat and hat on the floor under the chair and reset the dog at his feet . " I could have done that myself , " Cleveland said . Brobeck moved away , saying , " Take it easy now . " After his breath and heart steadied , Cleveland looked around . He could see Mattie and Mrs. Anderson , Mr. Collingsworth and Mary Jess and , next to her , Ben Tate , who held sheets of copy paper and a yellow pencil in his lap . There were the Legion boys ? Hank Stutemeyer , Alvor Torgerson , Jim Quinn , torchbearers for true America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kilmer and a spruced-up stranger who must be the speaker . Just behind him were Mort Ewing , his wife beside him . If he had to , Cleveland thought , he could name everyone present . That was the way of small towns ? no strangers . Opponents , even enemies , but no strangers . And it was the way of small towns to go to meetings , good and bad , exciting and dull , anything to relieve day-by-days . The hall , which would hold a hundred and more , was filling up . At the front of it rose a stage with a flag on it , but the arrangements committee apparently had decided on a lectern and desk , presumably to bring the truth nearer the people .  | After the last of the audience had trickled in , Kilmer walked to the lectern . A smooth , unsmiling bird , Kilmer . Commitment and its air of sincerity left no room for humor in him and no door to argument . Kilmer welcomed the audience and went on , saying , " A good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do more , that , in a sense , it quit hiding its light under a bushel . Tonight we are acting on that good advice . " Cleveland felt himself squirming . Though he could hardly qualify as a good friend , he was the one who had said that the Legion must make news if it wanted newspaper notice . " Yes , " Kilmer was saying , " we are doing something tonight , I am sure everyone will agree , something fitting and proper on the part of men who have fought for our country and who , by fighting , have manifested and increased their everlasting loyalty to the greatest nation on earth and to the principles on which it stands . " With that , he introduced the speaker , a man , he said , widely known and respected , a staunch upholder of the American way . And a lot of other damn things . It was his pleasure and privilege to present Major Mark McBride . McBride was smooth , too , smiling smooth , and the privilege was in reverse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an audience . Flowered bullshit so far . McBride half-turned and pointed to the flag on the stage and told how it was begot and what glory had attended its waving . The flag , the flags of all nations , Cleveland reflected , should have been listed along with the graven images men should not bow down before . What were they but pieces of bunting exalting to the farthest reaches of heaven good and bad both ? Respect for the flag was one thing , worship another . Bluster had let wind again . By rights he ought to share honors with the orator . On either side of Cleveland people put on a show of not sniffing . Like children in school they sneaked glances one at another , trying to detect who was guilty . McBride had come to the outrages perpetrated by enemies  | against public order and national safety , to shootings and bombings , to Centralia , Seattle , Atlanta , Washington , and Wall Street . Radicals were at the heart of the trouble , radicals , socialists , syndicalists , all adding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit of what was America . The outrages were real enough , Cleveland thought , but pretty old stuff if you ignored the case of Vanzetti and Sacco , which was still being argued . Of course McBride would n't mention excesses on the other side , since they were justified , patriotic manifestations . Neither would he mention labor , which had been conveniently consigned to the ranks of the radicals because some unions had rebelled against sure-enough grievances . " And now , " McBride was saying , " we come to the question of what the individual can do , how the honest and loyal citizen can work to save our society from the manifold perils besetting us . Oh , he is sly , that enemy of ours . He is devious . By subtle means he subverts our aims . A word here , a word there , outwardly innocent , a phrase , a paragraph inserted in otherwise innocuous print , a belittling and polluting of the moral standards honored through ages , an avowal of righteousness where little exists ? by such means does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too quick in these dangerous times to ignore , forget and forgive . " Cleveland straightened . The man was getting his teeth into something and doing it in that professional manner that held and persuaded most of those who listened and looked . The considered modulations of tone , the practiced gestures , the projection of earnestness against the threatening evil ? these were his stock in trade , and they worked . The son of a bitch was good , that was all . Turning , Cleveland saw that Mr. Collingsworth 's dusky face had gone rigid . If he did n't watch out , that smart-ass at the lectern would get a poke in the jaw . McBride seemed to be winding up as he spoke again . " Believe me , my friends , I speak without prejudice and without suspicion . I do not know what is taught in your schools . But do you ? That is the question . In this very school perhaps ? Have you examined  | the textbooks ? They can be enemy instruments . Do you know what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that defamer of village life ? A library can be the nesting place of sedition , and of perdition , if you please . What magazines are subscribed to ? The Nation ? The New Republic ? The Survey ? Harper 's ? The Scholastic , which parades as an educational organ ? " Oh , I tell you , good and loyal citizens , much that encourages the bolshevists and promotes their cause is to be found in these areas . If I had the power I would excise offending passages . Some publications I would order ? forgive me ? to hell . " The damn dog had offended again , but now no one noticed . They were caught up , these people , and held . Cleveland felt a slow fire in his guts . He wished he had whiskey to feed it . " I am powerless here , my friends , " McBride was continuing , " but you are not . You can appoint screening committees . You can examine the textbooks , the library books , the publications , and through your board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , investigate those who are guilty or suspect . Our children , yours and mine , must not be corrupted . They wo n't be if we exercise vigilance . " Only propriety , only the decency to let the man finish , was holding Collingsworth back , Cleveland thought as he turned again . But it still would n't do . Collingsworth would n't do . He would n't explain . He would n't debate . He would march up and swing . Mort Ewing in rebuttal ? Nope . It was n't Mort 's dish . Whose then ? That damn fire in his belly tormented him . " So , " McBride said , now for sure in conclusion , " let us give our loyal thoughts , our faithful hearts , our dedicated efforts to the cause of America . God bless our country , and God bless us all . " Almost as one man the crowd rose and applauded . The fools . The damned idiots . Shot in the ass by evangelism . Only the hammer of a spike in the skull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his eyes aimed like a rifle . Cleveland wrenched to his feet , went to take a step and fell over his dog . He got up by himself , gave the dog one quick pat and lurched to the lectern.  | " 0 ye of little faith , " he tried to shout . His lungs were in his belly . Somebody snickered . Slowly people sat down . Collingsworth was finding a vacant chair . " 0 ye of little faith in America . " He had found some voice now . A man ? Alvor Torgerson it was ? called , " Drunk again . " " Not drunk in the manner you are , " Cleveland said , pointing . " Not befuddled by the fumes of the phony . You , I suppose , judge yourself fit to decide what is fit to be read . " That ought to hold them . It seemed to . Torgerson had flunked out of high school . " Decipimur specie recti . ' That 's Latin , Mr. Torgerson , for We are deceived by what seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Earl Kilmer interrupted . " Did you ever fight for your country ? Ever bear arms for America ? " " I will come to that in due time , if you 'll have the courtesy to hear me . " He looked out and around , seeing the faces blurred , more curious than intent , more eager for a ruckus than for rebuttal . " Will you listen , you people among whom I 've spent more years than some of you can count in your lifetimes ? Will you hear me , knowing I am not socialist , syndicalist , bolshevist or anything but American ? " He had found wind and voice now and his tones rumbled in his ears . " How long , how long , has man fought to be himself ? How long for the right to think his own thoughts and speak his own words ? We go back , back through the centuries to Stephen Langton and King John and the eventual Magna Carta , the Great Charter , and before then to the mists of history , back and forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oppressive monarch , the priest , the tyrant under whatever guise , under whatever name . Among others , that name includes bolshevism . " All his adult life he had been ready with words , and he knew something of history , yet he had never been a public speaker and never tried to be , but it struck him as he gestured that he was getting some of the hang of it now , managing some imitation of McBride 's finesse ? the changing resonances , the pauses where useO 112  | ful , the right movements of head and arms . And it was all a cheap act , or it would have been but for the burn in him . " Long ago , in the year 1791 , our forefathers , drawing on the experiences of men before them , drew up our own Bill of Rights . The First Amendment gave and gives us freedom of religion , of speech , and of the press , and the freedom to assemble in peace and to petition the government for a redress of grievances . Those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have made America . Do you remember the words of one of the first of Americans and one of the greatest ? Thomas Jefferson said , I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man . ' " He wished he had a drink , if only of water , but thoughts kept spouting . He pointed to McBride . " You , sir , do n't agree with Mr. Jefferson . You do n't believe in the rights of man . You would have us all think alike , alike ' meaning like you . You would control and channel our thought and our speech , even as Russia , though at the other end of the political pole , controls and channels its people . Given enough power , sir , men like you would put men like me before firing squads . " McBride jumped half up from his seat , crying , " Now you wait just a minute ! " and then slammed back in his chair , clapped there by the hands on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told him , speaking loud , " You set there , mister ! We listened to you . " Cleveland nodded his thank-you . " We here have had our own guardians of freedom , largely unsung . You will remember the war years . You will remember the councils of defense and some of their idiotic excesses . In certain areas of the state ? indeed , nearly all ? men were joined in suspicion , one of another . The acceptance of slander and hearsay and unfounded or silly charges of disloyalty and pro-Germanism usurped the place of calm reason . It was almost enough to have been born abroad , or to be closely descended from those born abroad , to be under the dark of suspicion . Even some of you here tonight , I know , though you probably do n't , were named as disloyal. " 113 O  | He thought he could see an uneasiness in some of the faces , in those of first- and second-generation Americans . He took a breath and called on what strength he had . " Nothing came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man and one only was persuaded to shut up and put up for Liberty bonds . Other reports were found to be false or malicious . Why , I ask you , why ? It was because , in those times of fever , our fevered governor by accident appointed to our county council of defense two men of good judgment . Those men , as you know , were Mort Ewing and Professor Collingsworth , against one of whom you have heard slurs tonight . " There was n't much more to say , Cleveland thought , but there was more , and he would try to say it , though there were trembles in the hand and arm that supported him on the desk . The faces before him were blurring again . " Now , to go back . There are limits , necessary limits , to freedom of speech . You may not traduce a man with impunity . You may not bear false witness . You may not calumniate or malign . And it has been rightly and sensibly said that no man may cry fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Of a sudden he was lost , lost for words , mind collapsed and body about to go , too . His mouth tasted pasty . He fumbled for his handkerchief , and his hand felt the telegram he had forgotten . He took it out and opened it , willing his shaky hands to be still , hoping the crowd would indulge him while he made the pretense of having still more on his mind . Then he had it in plenty . " You , sir , " he said , pointing to McBride again , " have come close to traducement . Into this peaceful assemblage , into our loyal community , you have yelled fire when there is no fire . " It was Earl Kilmer who tried to get to his feet now , and again it was Mort Ewing , reaching over , who yanked him back . " A final point , " Cleveland went on , unsure that he could make it . " It has been asked if I ever fought for my country . Earl Kilmer has asked me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to speak . I am not a professional patriot . I have almost never mentioned my record and never leaned on it as some do , but I rode with Teddy Roosevelt 's Rough Riders . " O 114  | He held the telegram up and looked at McBride . " Major , did you ever fight for your country ? " " I was in service throughout the war . " The answer came clearly but as if from some too-bold assumption of confidence . " An unresponsive reply , Major McBride . I asked if you ever fought for your country , and I will answer for you . " Cleveland brought the telegram to full view . " You never bore arms . During the war , throughout the war , you occupied a cushy place in the department of the judge advocate . Do you deny it ? " McBride did n't reply , except to mutter , " It was n't so cushy . " " By Mr. Kilmer 's standards , then , you have no right to speak , though I grant you the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stream . Is one , and the only one , hatred ? Is one , and the only one , ignorance of the stuff of America ? Is one , and the only one , secret payments to you by companies that seek to raise false issues to the neglect of the real ? Do I traduce you ? Sue me if so . " They were all swimming now , McBride , Kilmer , Ewing , Tate , Mary Jess , all of them , their faces flowing and changing place while the hall rocked . But one final utterance , one final blow , then rest after a drink . " You are a self-appointed censor , McBride . You are a bookburner at heart . In you , deep in you , is the tyrant . We bid you goodbye , sir . We ask you to leave . " The lectern turned from him . The desk went away . A strange leg thrust out , numb to command . People seemed to be on their feet . They seemed to be clapping . They seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , " Thanks , Frank , " but it was n't Frank Brobeck . It was Ben Tate . Tate was getting him into his outdoor gear . Tate was saying , " Oh , you left your overshoes on . " Tate was lifting old Bluster . Tate was asking , " Got your car , Mr. Mack ? I 'll drive you home then . " The doorway was just behind them , and he thought he heard a hoarse voice sounding above other voices . It had to be Brobeck 's . " Now see here , folks , it was n't the Legion done this , not the whole ? " 115 O  | So he was home at last , and the place looked steady , looked fixed . The world had decided to settle down . At the door Ben said , " I 'm afraid your dog is on his last legs . " His eyes were n't on Bluster . " We 're all right , " Cleveland said . " Set him down . A long rest is what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , stooping . " I 'll take him in . " " Be quiet . Mag 's sleeping . " Cleveland went ahead , fumbling for light switches , trying not to totter . Ben put the dog down on the bedroom floor , at the place Cleveland designated . The dog crumpled and went to sleep or into a coma . It was a fine way to thank Ben ? to wish he 'd get the hell out and leave him to his bottle . Ben gave him a long look . " You 're all right ? " " Sure . " " Then I 'll go . I 'll turn off the lights . " He put out his hand . There seemed to be a strange twist to the young mouth . " Mr. Mack , " he said and appeared to hunt for more words , " Mr. Mack , damn it all , thank you . " He left then . Cleveland got the fresh bottle out of the closet . The infernal thing did n't want to be opened . He drank from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed , he felt a weak spread of strength . A big man , he was , a god-damned rousing success , declarer of independence for one and all . Let heaven sing his praise . Anyhow , his hand had steadied , and he would do what he had to do . He eased himself up and went to his chiffonier and from a drawer took a very small bottle and brush and stepped to the dog that lay with one eye half-open , unseeing , unhearing , closed to all dreams . He brushed the dog 's lips with the liquid . He said , " Goodbye , Bluster . Wo n't hurt , Doc Crabtree said . " The dog 's tongue came out and licked and licked again and then did n't lick . Cleveland returned the poison and went back to sit on the bed . He took another drink and sat , bottle in hand , and there was nothing in his head , not one thought , not one rernembrance to be regretted or savored . He ought to feel something , he told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but all he could do was sit and tl was thinking . He lifted the bottle again and drank and lowered it an ( slip from his hand and knew he was falling .  | OUTSIDE THE OFFICE , construction trucks rumbled , carrying explosives , cement , sand , lumber , machinery parts , gasoline . If he stepped outside , Ben knew , he would see other traffic and men on the sidewalks walking with purpose , from office to office and shop to shop . He would find carpenters and masons working and people snatching time to look on . Not for the first time he said to himself , " Some difference . " President Roosevelt might be an opportunist , a hasty improviser , a grandstander , but he had put men to work . He pecked away at an editorial , aware of without being distracted by the sounds of activity in the shop , where both Okay Myers and his son worked steadily now as journeyman printers . Yes , due credit to Roosevelt , credit for his public concern , his optimism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit for the great dam being built on the Breast . Especially hereabouts for the dam , which the Advocate had argued for over the years , Mary Jess notwithstanding . Mary Jess was an antiquarian . The editorial completed , he typed " 30 " on the sheet of copy paper and said to her , " I think I 'll go sound him out anyhow . " She sat at her desk , busy with figures . The years had n't changed her , unless a certain drawn refinement of features was change . They had n't changed her , and neither had wifehood . She remained beautiful and , somehow , untouched . She looked up and answered , " You know I think you 're being impulsive . " " Of course you do , but you know as well as anybody that we need a new building . "  | " It seems so right now . Will it later ? " He knew she was thinking of the lean times fresh in memory , of unpaid subscriptions , unpaid bills , scant advertising and dribbles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to survive . " Later , after the dam is finished , there 'll be thousands of acres more of irrigated land . I keep telling you that . " " You keep telling me that . " " Damn it , Mary Jess , nothing ventured , nothing gained , as they say . " They also speak about having all your eggs in one basket . " " It 's the only basket we have . " He got up and stood at the window . There was no purpose in argument . He ought to know that much by now . She would be unchanged forever , firm in first opinion , touched seldom in bed , the virgin deflowered but still virginal . He said , " See you . " Dust hung in the street , and dust dirtied the store windows , but in this time of boom nobody cared . Strangers on the street , too , newly-come businessmen and men drawn to Arfive from eastern Montana , where drought , wind and low prices had forced some farm families to subsist on jack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be able to grow , and to cut for their scrawny livestock the inedible Russian thistle that they called Hoover hay . Stricken though the immediate region had been , Ben thought as he walked along , Arfive and the county had known nothing that bad . No real dust storms , at their worst in the dust bowl but bad enough in eastern Montana , which blew the good earth away and buried farm buildings . No storms like that , although the county agent was advising strip farming as an answer to the blown loss of soil . No men of his knowledge so poor that housewives canned rodents , provided there was ammunition to shoot them . Lines , but not long lines , for handouts . Drought , yes . Hardship , yes . Forced departures for the West Coast , yes , some . Yet the county had fared better than most . Peter Sears was putting a new front on his building and rcinod- eling inside , spurred to do so by competition from Penney 's . There was enough business for both . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinks , tobacco and cards , and despite the brisk trade done by two so-called beer parlors . In his mind , as he made for the bank , ran the proofs of revival , most of them in sight on Main Street . A new hardware store , a new automobile dealership , two new gas stations , a new women 's store , three new restaurants , none so good as Eva Fox had once run . Spence Green was enlarging his drugstore , even though given more shelf space now that his whiskey business was ended . The state liquor store had taken over the trade . The old Club , Mort Ewing 's club , was a barbershop . Like its one rival , the bank building where he transacted his business had had its face scrubbed . ARFIVE STATE BANK shone on its front in bright metal . Stanton Rivers sat at his desk behind a waist-high partition , his attention alternating between the papers before him and the entrances and departures of depositors . He lifted a hand and said , " Afternoon , Ben @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed through the swinging gate and took a chair . Rivers asked about Mary Jess , commented on the weather , spoke about the dam and then asked , " Something special on your mind , Ben ? " He sat erect , just as he always stood erect . His dark face looked healthy . On it he grew a trim mustache that showed some gray . " Nothing immediate , Stan , but not too long delayed , either . I 'm putting out feelers . You know I 'm outgrowing my place ? " " I would imagine . " " It was an old building when I bought it . What 's more , there 's no room in it for the small engraving plant I want to buy and no room at all for more editorial help . I 'll have to have more . I need it now . " " Yes , I see . " Rivers ' eyes were alert and friendly . " I thought , given encouragement , I 'd have some plans drawn . I already have my eye on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I ca n't handle it without help . " Rivers flattened his cared-for hands on the desk . His mustache O 122  | moved to a smile . " Ben , I would n't worry . Go ahead and have the plans drawn . You do n't have any figures , even tentative , of course ? " " No . It 's too early . " " When you have , come around . I 'll have to consult the directors , naturally , but ? " His hand dismissed the directors . Ben rose and shook hands with him , saying , " Thanks , Stan , " and went through the gate and out the door , feeling pleased . A good reputation was almost like money in the bank . On the street he nearly collided with Frank Brobeck , who said , " Watch out there , Ben , running high-headed and blind like a loco horse . " " Hi , Frank . How goes it ? " Brobeck wore frontier pants , a fitted western shirt , a big hat and cowboy boots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked like the sheriff he had come to be . " Good enough , " Brobeck said and took him by the arm . " Got time to jaw a while ? " " Sure . " They walked to a worn street bench between two cottonwood trees , a good place to sit but for the dust and the hazard of birds overhead . " I 'm thinking , Ben , " Brobeck said and gave himself time to think . He had come a long way , Ben reflected , since those first days of acquaintance . Road crewman , deputy sheriff , then sheriff , and , along with political progress , a growing confidence of manner , a reputation for reason and honesty , an improvement in speech . With the years , his big , furrowed face had become almost handsome . " First off and by the way , " Brobeck said , " how about going hunting this fall ? For elk , I mean ? We could get up a party . " Ben answered , " Well , maybe . We 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So will I , and that 's the God 's truth . " He sighed . " Ben , you got no idea . " " That depends on the subject . " " The subject is these shanty towns roundabout ? three of 123 O  | ' em ? and the men and women the dam has brought in . Christ ! " Traffic flowed on the street , and foot traffic sounded behind them , and Ben said , " I 've seen them . I know . " " But you really do n't . Oh , let ' em have their beer and their outlaw booze and their young floozies and their old slum whores . Gambling , too . Who cares ? " " You seem to . " " And what it all brings on . That 's what I care about . Fights every night , bad fights , and they have to be busted up . Then no one will bring a charge or appear as a witness . And that road to and from Burtville , it 's death alley . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three towns , we try to restore order , but , hell , how you going to restore it when it was n't there in the first place ? My staff works its ass off , and what 's to show for it ? No cases , that 's what . " Brobeck sighed again and put a hand to his cheek . " And the kids in those shacks , the poor , goddamn kids . Some run wild . Some go hungry and wonder whereabouts are their folks . Quite a few get sick , and no one to nurse them . And , Ben , some go to whoring right after being toilet-trained . " " The paper speaks its mind , week after week . " " Sure . I got no reason at all to criticize you . It 's just that there 's nothing to be done , and I get tired of it . " " You 're not thinking of resigning , Frank ? You could n't be . " " It 's not in my mind , but I could resign and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I got quite a pile for the old homestead that the dam will flood . But I 'm hanging on , hell or high water . " " Good for you . Good for all of us . " Now Brobeck smiled his crinkled smile . " That 's really what I wanted to talk to you about . Close to it . " Abruptly the face sobered . " Ben , I would n't want to go against you . I would n't do it . " What in the world are you talking about ? " " The state senate . Or the house . Higher office . I hear people say you would be a good man , and there 's no doubt about that . " There was a question in the big face . O 124  | " That 's nonsense , nonsense because I wo n't run , " Ben said . " I 'm the outsider looking in and always will be . " Did Mary Jess remember those words ? " You 're sure ? " " Positive . " Ben grinned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . " Brobeck thrust out a sudden hand . " Ben , " he said , " thanks . I just might need you . " They got up and walked on , and Ben crossed the street to the office . " I think I 'll run out to the construction site , " he said to Mary Jess , who had switched to her typewriter . " Want to come with me ? " " No thanks . I 'm swamped . " He said , " So be it , " and was sorry immediately . A good share of the personality of the paper , a good share of credit for its survival , was hers . He stepped over and kissed the brow that she lifted . " Do n't hurry . You might eat out tonight , Ben . I 'm going to get a scratch supper for Father , then hurry off to that meeting tonight . " " You work too hard . " " As if you had n't been working every night of the week . Besides , I enjoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Enjoyed work too much . Enjoyed it at the cost of what might and should be . " All right , " he said . He went to the car and wheeled off . The day , at least , was fine . The afternoon sun smiled on the work of man . The breeze held its breath , and so the dust hung like a long banner on the road to the dam . It was like a big , torpid snake , kept alive as moving wheels fed it . Through the dust , along the meanders of the Breast River , he could see the winding growths of willow and cottonwood . They stood still , satisfied in the sun 's rays . Had Mary Jess been Mattie Murchison , she would be at his side . If he were to suggest they turn off to the woods and make love , she would smile and be willing . But Mattie was married 125 O  | now , to a second cousin of her first husband , and had a son , both events announced in jocular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked , that she had n't had to change her name ? But it had been a long time since he 'd heard from her , a long time since those Tuesday nights . A jack rabbit lay mashed in the road . A couple of magpies flew up from it . Farther along lay a dead porcupine , then a skunk . The odor of skunk filled the Buick . The dam site was a confusion of machinery and men , of noise and dust , of moving and unmoving equipment . He pulled his car off to the side and watched , regretful of his ignorance about construction . But he had a right to feel that the dam was his , some part of its being was his , a little , mixed with the shares due the PWA and the President . The unacknowledged editor still was entitled to some satisfaction in self . A road of sorts led around the construction site and on into the canyon . He started his car , tooled it along the road and after a mile or so stopped at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the river ran free , as if never to be stopped in its course . Here was no dust , and the noises from downstream came muted , sounding under the river 's soft murmur . A patch of broad-leafed fireweed shone like a spangle on the near shore . He left the car and sat close to the bank and saw a trout jump in a pool where the stream turned . The sun , declining , touched one shoulder and the side of his face . A voice from behind him asked , " How 's the quill driver ? Hey , do n't jump through your collar . " " Oh , hi , lap . Did n't hear you . Lots of room to sit down . " Jasper York sat , saying , " You city fellers got no ears . " He was a man of perhaps fifty-five , his skin darkened by sun , his eyes squinted by it . When he was n't trapping or guiding anglers and hunters , he bached it in town , where he was known for an occasional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How are you , Jap ? " ' The happy loafer on horseback , that 's me . Horse is grazin ' O 126  | over yonder . But how am I for a fact ? " The rumble of blasting came from downstream , and Ben could feel a quiver of earth . " I 'm thinkin ' the Bible played hell when it said the earth was made for man . That 's how I am . " York got out a pipe , crumbled tobacco in his palm and lit up . The stream talked , and a breath of breeze played with a leaf . " Make the most of it while you can , " York said . His eyes rose to the mountain side and lifted to the clear sky . " This here , " York went on , waving his pipe stem . " This grass , them trees , them posies along the bank , brutes , big and little , the mountains theirselves . " His head moved in a slow shake . " That Jesus Christ dam ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yeah , men . I had a pet once , a cub bear , just the one , and I cared a heap for him .

Did n't say how many men owed their room and board to that fight . And now for relief , so men can eat , as you say , we got a general program for rodent control . Goodbye , all ground squirrels and bunnies and such . Eat hearty , men . " Ben grinned , as he imagined York wanted him to . " But , Jap , " he said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In your own lifetime you 've seen a lot of changes . " " Ca n't call to mind any good ones right now . " York fell silent , then added , " Hell , I know I 'm a lost coyote , the last coyote cryin ' to the last moon . Jap York . Jap York . ' Do n't that sound like a bark ? " York faced toward him , and Ben saw sadness in his eyes , the sadness of goodbye said by him or the world . " Sorry for my jabber , " York said , getting up . He knocked the ashes from his pipe on the heel of his hand and put the pipe in his 127 O  | pocket . " You do n't feel it like me and you do n't agree , but that 's all right , Ben . " He walked away , as silently as he had come . In the west the sun had vanished beyond a cloud bank , leaving only the fire of its going by the time Ben returned to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brobeck 's talk had suggested , meant only an extra five miles , and Mary Jess would n't be waiting him . Some distance before he came to the squatting of shacks , he saw and picked up the girl .  | AT FIRST , in the fading light , he thought she was a boy , an undersized boy who dragged one lame foot in the roadside dust and appeared as lonely as the last of the race . But when she raised a hesitant thumb , he saw she was a girl dressed in a blouse and jeans . He braked the car , steered to the side and asked , " Town ? " As she approached , he leaned over and opened the door , seeing a young , lonely face with the look of haunt in it . She pulled herself inside and pushed back her long hair . Her brow was good . She said , " Thanks , Mister . " " You 've hurt yourself ? " " I sprained my dumb ankle . That 's why I thumbed you . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 'd better see a doctor , do n't you think ? " " It 'll heal by itself . I got no money for doctors . " Her voice was soft and matter-of-fact . As if to answer the question he had n't posed , she added , " It 's my old man 's fault . We had a big row and I went for a walk to cool off . " " Your father ? " " Who else ? He 's the only old man I got , not that he 's someone to brag on . Two years ago or somewhere near , Ma , she took off with another man . I ca n't blame her one bit . " A car went by , and someone , probably a drunk , called out , and the call settled and died along with the raised dust . " You 're ready to go home now , I suppose . " " Got to , havin ' lamed myself up . The old man 's likely got 129 O  | some liquor in him by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without sloshin ' it all out . " He studied her , feeling pity . She could n't be more than fifteen or sixteen or , at most , a small seventeen . Without embarrassment she let him look , like a child innocently open to scrutiny . " You live in Burtville , then ? " " Upstairs over Smitty 's beer parlor , my old man and I , if you can call it livin ' . The old man , he tends bar and swamps out when he 's sober enough . " " I see . And you 're the cook ? " " Sometimes . When there 's somep'n to cook . Mostly we live on pretzels and crackers and maybe a piece of smoked sausage or cheese or pickled stuff that the old man sneaks from the bar . He ai n't got much appetite . " And so it was all accounted for , the lean features , the slim boyishness , even the look of haunt . She asked , " Want to feel my ribs ? " " No . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car lights on , dimming them . " What 's your name ? " " Beulah . It 's supposed to be Beulah Sanders , only I ai n't sure if my old man 's my old man or not . When he 's mad , he says damn if I 'm any blood kin of his , for a true Sanders has got more to him than me . Mostly he 's mad when he 's drinkin ' . " " And most of the time he drinks ? " " That 's where ever ' cent goes , on booze . Lookit here . " She showed the worn cuff of her blouse . " I have to wash it all the time , it bein ' one of just two , which is all I got to my name . " Cars were wheeling in from the dam site now , more and more of them , their lights striking through the Buick and going on . He rolled his window tight against the dust . He should drive on , he knew , but her matter-of-fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more to tell . Something had to be done for her . " So you and your father quarreled ? " " I already said so . " " Care to tell me what about ? " " You ask a lot of questions , mister , but I do n't mind . It was n't  | about booze we had our fight . He 's so damn moral , if that 's what you call it . Goody-goody , I call it . Wants me in my cage starvin ' , just so 's I got a rag to cover myself . " " So ? " " I was goin ' to Big Lil 's and make a nice livin ' . " " Good Lord ! Big Lil 's ! " To men she was known as Big Tit Lil , madam of the main whorehouse in Burtville . " If she 'll take me , that 's where I 'm goin ' once my ankle 's all right . " " You know what she does ? What her girls do ? " " Sure . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can be broke in . Anything 's better than nothin ' . That 's what I told the old man , and he got on his high horse , sayin ' no Sanders ever went chippie . " You could look for work ? other work . " " What ? Washin ' dishes for my meals and a poor penny extra ? Mister , some of those girls at Big Lil 's make twenty-five dollars a night , maybe more . Besides , there 's no dish-washin ' jobs around that I know of . " How tell this girl ? How explain to this child ? How make her see age ahead of her , age and blowsiness and bloat ? To her the future was twenty-five dollars a night and a square meal . He asked her , " How old are you ? " " Old enough . You can see . " With one quick movement she bared a breast . In the dim light it looked as round and as plump and as fresh as a peach just picked . He kept his hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " " I was just provin ' it to you . " " Cover up ! " " Sure , mister . I did n't mean to be dumb , but dumber girls than me work at Big Lil 's , I bet . " " I 'm sure of that . But , look ! Before you tackle Big Lil for a place , let me scout around . There 's sure to be other work for you . There 's bound to be something better . " " Anything 's better than the shape I 'm in now . Hungry and ragged and broke . That 's me. " 131 O  | " I 'll try to help you . I 'm going to give you some money right here . " " I was n't hintin ' at that . " " I know you were n't . I 'm going to give it to you provided you do n't try for Big Lil 's . " " For how long ? " " Just until we see . " " Well ? " He took out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ten and a five . He held them out to her . " Mister , " she said , not taking them , " I ai n't on charity , but I got only one thing to give . You just have to say yes or no . " She turned her face to him , the young , lean , sober face which now held the look of pleading as if she hoped to be spared but still would consent . This for that , tit for tat , it for fifteen dollars if he insisted . He thrust the bills in her hand , put the car in gear and said , " No , Beulah . " In Burtville she pointed . " There 's where I live . At Smitty 's . Over the beer joint . " He pulled to the side and stopped . There were customers and lights in the beer joint . A man with whiskers and alcoholic ruin in his face stood behind the bar and tried to squint through the window . " He 's lookin ' for me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " My old man . Pretty , ai n't he , mister ? " " Remember your promise , " he told her . As if in grateful goodbye she flung her young body against his and kissed him . Of themselves his hands and arms tightened on her , and he abruptly pushed her away . She said , " That was my thanks , mister . " " All right . Go now . " She let herself out and limped for a step or two , the bills upheld and forgotten in her hand , and watched him as he drove away . Big Lil 's house ? a sort of cluster of shacks ? came to his eye . Beulah would have been in demand at Big Lil's.  | He ate a late and solitary supper and , eating , happened to think of that new woman appointed to the federal emergency relief office . Her name ? Herlihy , was n't it ? Patricia Herlihy . She would be a good one to see about Beulah . The house was dark when he entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That you , Ben ? " " Yes , governor . Good night . " He undressed in the bathroom . Mary Jess would be asleep ? or pretending to be .  | MR . COLLINGSWORTH placed his knife and fork on his plate , used his napkin , sighed with satisfaction and said , " A good meal , Mary Jess , dear . " It was , Ben thought , an often-expressed judgment and a true one , though only the Lord knew how she found time for cooking . To his " Amen " Mary Jess answered , " Thank you both . " " I 've hardly had time to tell you that we got a letter from Charles today , " Mr. Collingsworth said . Mary Jess asked , " Any special news ? " " No . You can read it , of course . Between the lines it appears he continues to do splendidly , especially in English and music . " " Not homesick ? " " Never once , apparently . You would have thought he would return home for vacation rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that this country seems to have no hold on him at all ? " " He hears Thoreau 's different drummer , " Ben put in . " I suppose , but I feel sure I could n't live in New York , not for a king 's ransom , though I 'd like to be able to say I was a graduate of Columbia . " He paused and went on , an edge of regret in his voice , " The different drummer . Two boys reared in the same place , in much the same manner , but young Mort seems to be pleased with our state college . I was speaking to his father today . " The talk went on as Mr. Collingsworth liked it to after dinner . Talk and more talk . Discussions about matters both big and small . Chit-chat . Personal reports . Questions about the pronunciations and meanings of words . References to the dictionary O 134  | kept ready to hand on a stand at the side of the room . It was quite a well-furnished room , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the furniture , some of it , was elegant . By any standards the best pieces were very good , though shaded by the presence of the old upright piano Charles used to practice on . Mary Jess had been the principal collector . Through him she had developed an interest in antiques that exceeded his own , and in off hours during those dead days before work began on the dam had scoured the country , going to auctions and junk shops , storage sheds and battered homes . Once in a while she had picked up for pittances the good pieces that owners , hard put for cash , had thrust aside even in better times . A Hepplewhite to go along with the one he had bought years ago . A Chippendale chest . An inlaid , mahogany , half-moon table . Some of the better Victorian stuff . Probably it was all made by ancient American craftsmen , not imported , but it was all good , fine in line , shape and substance , and it was all old . She rejoiced in finding and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Better to have one passion than none at all . And he had enjoyed the refinishing , taken pleasure in working with the old , whispering cherry and walnut and mahogany . Mr. Collingsworth had gone silent . A frown creased his forehead , and lines deepened at the sides of his mouth . No doubt he was thinking about some vexation the day had brought , and , like as not , he would speak next with blind heat , in hard , leveled tones , addressing his dissatisfaction to a found substitute . You never could tell . He was that way . They were awkward , even disturbing , these sudden and fugitive rages , but they were best ignored , best let pass . They were excused by Mr. Collingsworth 's general worth , his stout intentions , by the sun that followed the heat lightning . And if keeping still made the listener feel somewhat like second fiddler , what of it ? Besides , Mary Jess would n't want her father disputed . Ben pushed back from the table , saying , " I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work again ? " Mary Jess asked . " Call it an errand of mercy , " he said and got to his feet . She would n't care to hear about Big ' Fit Lil and a poor girl who 135 O  | thought she could learn how to earn twenty-five dollars a night . " Be home early . " He walked to the rack , put on his hat and went out to their goodbyes . The late summer night welcomed him . It breathed the assurance of well done and all right , though the day had seen little done . Overhead the stars waited the rise of the full moon . To the west he could see the vague line of the Rockies , gentled by distance and night . It was a short drive to the two-story apartment building , once given over to a cheap store and cheap offices , where Patricia Herlihy had suggested he come , thus avoiding her constant workaday interruptions . He climbed to the second floor and knocked at her door . She opened it at once . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do come in . " She was a small , erect girl , on the edge of plump , who could have been twenty-six years old . A neat package , Frank Brobeck had called her . She had substituted a flowered housecoat for the suits Ben had seen her wear . " Take that chair , " she said after he had acknowledged her greeting and entered . " It 's reasonably comfortable . " The room was small but tasteful enough . Its size seemed to suit her , as did the tidy furnishings . Yes , a small neatness all round . Her face , he figured , was Irish ? bright blue eyes , very fair complexion , nose small and a little upturned , and that appearance of wit and impudence that could readily turn to belligerence . " Would n't you like a beer to start things off ? " she asked . " It 's really not necessary , and I promise not to take much of your time . " " Would n't you ? " " Well , yes , thanks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and after serving him sat down , unaware or heedless that the housecoat spread open from above her knee to her ankle . The exposed leg was good , he saw , before her glance drove his eyes away . She lit a cigarette . " You said the business was personal . " A smile went with the words . 11cr teeth were good , too . After drinking , she went on , O 136  | " Rather short acquaintance for personal things . " She smiled again . " Tell me . " " Personal , " he said , feeling a little on guard , " but hardly as the words might suggest . " " Yes , " she answered and listened , her eyes on him as she sipped at her beer . He told her about Beulah Sanders , how he had happened to meet her , what she had said , how she had impressed him , and why he had come here . Miss Herlihy , not interrupting , had finished her drink by the time he was done . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " she said . Her smile struck him as somewhat at odds with the sentiment . " I hope not . " " Apparently this girl made quite an impression on you ? " " She was so young . " " How old ? " " Surely not more than seventeen . She would n't tell me her age . She just said she was old enough . " " Of course she is . Our sex gets that way early . Out of mothers ' arms into men 's . " She made a small face . " Who wrote The Way of All Flesh ? The title at least is wonderful . " " I do n't know , but ? " " Yes , Mr. Tate . Back to the subject . " Her smile lightened her blue eyes , as if by sudden infusion . " But would you think ill of me , sir , if I suggested we had an honest drink first ? My grandfather always said beer was a beverage for brats . " " No objection , but I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Inventory , one bottle , " she answered and took their glasses and went to the kitchen . She returned briskly after a minute , handed him a glass and sat down . " Now to business . " He took a swallow , watching her do the same , and , when he could , asked , " Did you add any water at all ? " " Some . Enough for me . If it 's too strong , the tap 's in the kitchen . " 137 O  | " No . It 's all right after the first shock . " " Drink , then . " She followed her own order , taking a gulp that he found hard to equal . Mort Ewing would have said the drink was as strong as Kentucky studhorse piss . " Speaking of books ? " she began . " Who 's speaking of books ? " " I was , just a minute ago . How are you coming along ? " " With what ? " " Your book . Every newspaperman has a book in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The whiskey felt good in his stomach . He took another swallow . " Once I was going to , " he said . " And never have ? " " Never a decent line . Hardly any lines at all . " " Why ? " ? It was none of her business . " In the ten years I 've been here , it 's been a struggle . Only lately have things begun to look up . " " But still you wo n't write your book ? " She tilted her glass . " Excuse me if I say you 're an inquisitive miss . But all right . Iii the beginning I thought I 'd write about the war , as soon , that is , as I could bear to think about it . Time went on , and other men wrote about it , better by far than I ever could do . So now ? " Sure enough , he thought to himself , once he had thought 1 . might write a book or perhaps a series of books . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had established himself , for time spread forever ahead . But the years passed , closing doors . They took with them some part of energy , some part of ambition , some part of hope , even some part of regret at things left undone . ' Mat was the final loss , the slipping away of regret . But these were oldman thoughts . Hell , he was only thirty-eight . She had allowed him time for reflection , which he ended by saying , " What 's wrong with a good newspaper ? " " Nothing , but are n't there stories everywhere , even in way stations like Arfive ? Men live and work and dream and love and suffer and ( lie . "  | " Agreed , but do n't knock our town . It 's home . " " I did n't and wo n't . Here 's how ! Home to the sailor . " She was a greedy drinker . He had to keep gulping to keep up . The whiskey had brought a light flush to her cheeks . If possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort a man could think of a blossom waiting for pollination . She said , lifting her glass , " I like to drink , if that 's news for your paper . You can also report that I 'm up and at ' em every morning and keep up the pace through the day . Do n't you enjoy wetting your nose ? " " Yes , but it 's hardly compatible with circumstance . " It was as if she were studying him and the words , seeking conclusions , and he felt himself shy away from the possibility that she might press him for explanation . In the presence of a woman like this one , what man cared to admit that he largely abstained because of his wife and her father ? A man liked to appear to be his own man , and it struck him , not for the first time , that in some ways he was not . He felt the good strength of the whiskey in his blood stream . " Under the circumstances , " she said , " let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He followed her to the small kitchen . She got out an ice tray and put cubes in their glasses . In this close space his nose opened to her perfume . It caught the faint , good , woman smell of her . " Say when , " she said , pouring from a bottle labeled Bottoms Up . Back in the living room she said , " I 'm garrulous . That 's because I seldom have company . But do n't think I 've forgotten the purpose of your visit . To save a poor girl from a life of shame . " " And the miseries that go with it . " " Frankly , " she said with a sudden businesslike air , " I hardly see how our office can be of help . " " Why ? " ? " We 're involved in programs , relief programs , to be sure , but they 're not directed so much to individuals as to groups and masses . Our object is to give work to men , to restore pride through self-sufficiency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Your girl apparently will have no trouble finding work , work of her choice . For the self-supporting we have no program . " " It 's not work she would choose , if you can call it work . It 's not work anyone would choose for her . " " Oh , yes , men would choose it for her . Without men she would n't have work . But , even so , as it is she has food and shelter . " " Of a sort . " " Better than a lot of people . But , as I said , we try to provide work for men out of work , and for impoverished boys , too , as in the Civilian Conservation Corps . I 'm afraid not much attention has been paid to women , though we have one in the cabinet . Men are the breadwinners . Hence men are the masters . " " But surely ? " " Oh , I 'll see this girl of yours , since you asked me to . I 'll try to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But , tell me , Mr. Tate , just what is so wrong with prostitution ? " " You ca n't be serious . " " Ca n't I ? " " She 's just a kid . " " And my office is not a vice squad , thank God . Your kid is big enough , as she told you . She can make herself self-supporting , and that 's the whole aim of the programs ? self-support . " " No matter how . That 's what you 're telling me ? " " I 'm telling you this . Through the trickle-down process ? no pun  --  when men have work , prostitutes can be self-supporting . They do n't need us . But you avoid the main question . What really is so wrong with prostitution ? " The imp in her face asked for an argument , but all he said was , " You know as well as I do . " " I know that every woman has regarded prostitution with some measure of fascination . If she has n't , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll mix the drinks , since you seem a little upset . " When she returned , he asked , " You 've been married ? " " Briefly . The bottle was my man 's single devotion , but I would O 140  | have made a pretty fair wife . But have you ever thought about what I just said ? " " If I have , it 's just now . " She drank , thoughtfully rather than thirstily . Then she turned the smile on again . " This may shock you , Mr. Tate , but if I had one piece of advice to give a young girl it would be this : Beware of the man who seeks to protect your virtue . What he means is , save it for me . " " That 's not true in my case . " " No , Mr. Tate ? " " Doubt me if you will . " " Perhaps you may come to doubt yourself . " " You 're really spoiling for an argument . " " Really , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , lifted his glass . " I 'm saying ? I do n't mean to offend your delicate sensibilities ? if your little girl wants to be a whore , she 'll be one , and I 'm asking what 's wrong with that ? " " But you will see her ? " " I said I would , and I will . " " And try to do something for her ? " " Something you think should be done for her . I yield to your noble principles . " She finished her drink . " End of argument . End of interview . " At the door she took his arm . " I 'm really quite moral , " she said . " I do n't believe in charging for what is my pleasure , too . " She gave him a sudden , full-mouthed kiss and then pushed him away and demanded , " Begone ! " A teaser , he thought as he went to his car . He found himself striding . A mere teaser , or more than that ? He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary Jess . Drowsily , without heat , in her soft-singing voice she said , " You stink of whiskey , " and moved away from him . How did it happen , where was the why of it , that Mr. Collingsworth should have sired and reared a daughter both sterile and frigid and a son whose masculinity just might be open to doubt ? Patricia Herlihy was really quite moral .  | BED WAS A GOOD PLACE to be ? or could be . He lay in it , alongside Mary Jess , and let a side thought go to Beulah Sanders . Surely , after two days , Pat Herlihy would have found time to see her . They appeared in his mind , the lonely , the haunted face that had talked about whoring , and the impudent , Irish face that had seen nothing wrong in it . And into their company came Mattie Murchison . How long , how long since they had found relief in each other ? How long since those Tuesday nights when they had made love without loving involvement ? Body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with Mattie Murchison . Any of them . It was faithless to dwell on them , to feel himself swelling with memory and impossible prospect . He moved closer to Mary Jess and put his arm over her and pressed himself against her seat . There was always the chance , the slim chance . She said , her voice as always somehow seductive , " Please , Ben , not tonight . I 'm tired out . Wo n't you move back ? " " Lord , Lord , " he answered and , when she did n't reply , asked , " Why not , Mary Jess ? Why are you always too tired ? " " Please do n't exaggerate . " " All right . Nearly always too tired ? Or something ? " " It 's you , Ben , if you 'd only admit it . I 'm a perfectly normal woman . He shifted away from her , knowing embrace and the push of his body were of no use , asking as he moved , " Who is the judge of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long ago that women were liars , one to another , unwilling to admit normal appetites to those of the same sex . And was n't his own experience , though limited , enough to prove Mary Jess wrong ? He said , " So all marriages are frustrating to men ? " She turned face to face to him then , her knees drawn up like barriers . " I suppose you can speak for all men ? " The lovely voice had the strain of anger in it . " Just as you can speak for all women . " Ten years , he thought , ten years since their marriage , and he had believed then that the nagging , the aching urgencies would be quieted , that love would be answered with acts of love , that all would be well ? husband 's needs satisfied , wife happy to satisfy them . Out of bed in the morning and brave for the world . And all of it only a dream that reality shattered . Only a damn dream dreamed in ignorant youth . She said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ben " in her words was significant . " Understand yourself . " " Sure . I 'm a sex fiend . " " At any rate you 're insatiable . " " Am I ? Two times a month if I 'm lucky . You ration it out like limited calories . " " I wo n't argue with you . I said I was tired . " " It 's a sort of tyranny , the way you use sex . Give the boy one cookie if you must and afterwards expect him to be a good boy to the point of death by starvation . " " I wo n't listen to any more . " " Do n't , then , for Christ 's sake . " " Your swear words entice me . " " Fine , goddamn it . " " You 'll wake up Father . " " I 'll bet he had it better than I do . " The bed moved to her sudden rigidity . He heard her breathing . At last she said , " If I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Divorce you , you mean ? " he answered unbelieving . " Not that . " " No . Just sleep in other beds if you must , but be discreet . As a  | couple we have a reputation to maintain . " The last words sounded wry . " I do n't want to lie in other beds . " He was close enough to the truth to justify what he said . " I give you your freedom . I just do n't care . Only be discreet . " " That 's exactly what I might do , " he replied and felt lost , lost to the lost dream , lost to the bonds he respected , lost to all save the free future and a new , slow anger . To save them she had to give so very little of self . She had only to yield , only to goddamn yield . So little to ask . He rolled to his side of the bed , saying shortly , " Good night . " He lay awake wanting her , wanting her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was so little to give , he thought , so great to get and so hard to come by . And now it served her right if she had to cry . Were all men like Ben , she asked herself ? The answer was probably . It might be that most of them actually were . Men . Barnyard roosters , happy only in a harem of hens . Nature 's way for the race to perpetuate itself , as if child after human child mattered . She had no wish to perpetuate herself . God knew her mother and father had done enough of that . Pregnancy on pregnancy until Mother died of pregnancies ; and the end result , the token reward was a bundle of red wrinkles that grew up to be Charles . Thank heavens Brother Charles showed no outward interest in sex . She was probably sterile and should be glad . Accused , Ben had confessed to times he had n't taken precautions , but nothing had happened except the long dread of pregnancy . She did n't , she would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to Ben , and he had promised not to forget or ignore them . Sterility , and it was just as well , an added insurance , though , more than ever , it made the act of sex empty . The act of love , it was known as , as if love could n't exist without the coarse seal of performance . ' I'lhe coarse seal , nearly always unwelcome , never invited . Most O 144  | women must think and feel as she did , and , if they did n't , nevertheless here she was , incapable of keeping Ben satisfied , incapable really of ever finding joy and release in the act . She would n't cry , she told herself ! The hand on which her head rested closed into a fist . She would n't cry . The problem was Ben 's , and he could n't help himself , either . Why cry ? Once or twice Ben had tried his little tricks , thinking to arouse her while he pushed hard on her body ; and the tricks had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father had had it better than Ben , Ben had said with thoughtless or thoughtful cruelty , touching on circumstances best never thought about . She had ceased trying to understand the physical woman who had been her mother . And no longer did she feel any grievance toward Father . Maybe it was because in his long , wifeless years he had never shown an interest in another woman . Not once had he . Pictures of Mother , six of them , stood arrayed in his bedroom , and , sometimes , entering , she had caught him studying them with what seemed to be and must be devotion . And sometimes , unknown to him , she had heard him singing , " No rose in all the world until you came . " The one woman in his life , the abused , cherished woman , loved beyond all . It was unlikely men like Ben ever could understand . But Ben was such a good man . Give him credit . List his qualities , forgetting his animal appetite . Industry . Patience . Thoughtfulness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He overlooked , he dismissed Father 's senseless bursts of temper . He did n't argue . He did n't disagree , and he did n't concede . He just kept silent , even when Father needed rebuke . She should be glad he restrained himself , even if it made him seem , well , rather pale , even if she wished he 'd talk back as she had learned not to do . Only a time or two had Ben suggested , mildly suggested , that they buy or build their own house and vacate the old premises . He had understood , then , that she could n't leave Father , could n't possibly leave him . For his sake , they could n't . Forget Ben 's . Forget hers . Think of Father . He would n't be happy without them . He would n't be happy anywhere else . Here was home .  | A patient man , Ben . A cheerful man . A successful one . A mild man , tolerating in his house another of more outspoken and heated opinion . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rutting . Now pray that no other woman came into his life . Pray for constancy . Pray against anything that would mar or ruin their marriage . She could see him lying with some willing partner . She could hear them whispering confidences . And a sudden fury came on her and turned into hurt . Such a good man , and if he asked her now , she would come to him . If only he put his arm around her and told her he loved her . But , freed , he lay still , far away from her , a great divide between them , the divide she had erected , hard and impassable . Move to me , Ben ! Ask and it shall be given you . It was then that she could n't keep from crying .  | THEY DROVE to the office together , as wordless , it seemed to Ben , as two strangers passing on opposite sides of the street . There came a time when talk ended , a time when talk threw up a wall between talkers that more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but who would concede ? Not Mary Jess , that was sure . And not he , that was just as sure . It gave a man a certain , a rightful satisfaction to reach a position from which he would n't budge . Only when they were in the office did he say , " Do n't count on me today . Sportsmen 's Club meeting at noon , Lions Club meeting tonight . " " Very well . You can have the car . Father will pick me up . " " No need to . One of the boys will drive me home . " " Very well . " He looked in the shop and found the men busy , without need of directions , and gathered some copy paper and overdue bills and went out . Dust was a price of progress . It rose and hung and settled down on the town only to rise again , whipped up by trucks and pickups and passenger cars . Just a year , maybe two years ago , it would have lain undisturbed except now and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece of rare business and the price of a gallon of gas . Hurrah for progress , then , but it was time the town paved its streets . It could afford to . There was a subject for an overdue editorial . And the old cottonwoods , dusted over now , that shaded Main Street . Some of them were dying , and more had been cut down . The damn birds , you know , and , what 's more , a business147 O  | man wants his sign to be seen , not lost in a bunch of branches , the guilty parties had argued , ignoring the fact that the trees gave the town a pleasing individuality that most high-plains settlements lacked . There was another editorial , one for Mary Jess , if and when . He dropped into Billie Gayle 's place for a package of cigarettes , and Billie said gently , while an ungentle fate agitated his hands , " Morning , Ben . Fatimas again ? " " Fine morning , Billie . Yes , please . " " Every morning is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " To wake up to any morning is fine . To know you 're still here . " " You sound pretty doleful . " " Oh , no .

" There , for Billie , was the sum of it all , Ben thought , all that he asked for , all perhaps that he wanted , plus , of course , enough money to supply his few needs . Any mornings fine and all mornings good to remember . Let the world wake to light , struggle from bed , fumble into clothes with hands and feet that would n't take orders , and rejoice for the dawn . " Sure , Billie , " Ben said , touched by a sense of shame , " I 'm with you . " He took his change from the trembling , uncomplaining hand and walked back to the street . He went to the Forest Service office and found that no fires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after a combined loss for which the ranger would supply figures tomorrow . He learned at the offices of the Corps of Engineers that work on the dam was abreast of schedule or even ahead of it . Penney 's spoke for a full-page ad , Peter Sears wanted a half one , and Spence Green one of two columns . The new man at the new lumberyard paid up , with apologies . Patricia Herlihy was walking up the street as he came out of the lumberyard office . She wore a businesslike suit , a little severe for place and weather , but above the close neck of it her face seemed to bloom . He said , " Good morning , Miss Herlihy. "  | " Since when , Ben ? " " Since when what ? " " Since when Miss Herlihy ? " " All right , Patricia or Pat . Still , good morning . " " A busy one , " she said . " Busy days , all of them . " " Too busy for what we talked about ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't forgotten . " " Or done anything ? " She frowned and said , " Just a little . I 'm afraid it needs discussion . " " All right . When ? " " I 'll have some office news for you , too . " " That 's good . When again ? " The frown turned into her impudent smile . " Would it compromise the editor to come to see me tonight ? I 'll be home . " At his hesitation she added , " For the sake of appearances you could bring your briefcase . " It came on him to say , " And a bottle ? " " Why not ? " She clicked off in her high heels , her face smiling as she looked over her shoulder . So Pat Herlihy had n't exercised herself to help Beulah Sanders . It was doubtful she would . The roguish and provocative face faded into that of a lean , little girl with disappointment in it , the sad eyes fixed on Big Lil 's . Where else could she turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not there . And it struck him that what she would sell was the very thing that his groin demanded , though not from her . No , not from her . Put that base thought aside . Bury it . But so things went ? good intentions , untoward and sneaky impulses , and no answers that satisfied both . No answers . That was the answer to life . No answers . Yet he could go to the post office , scribble a hopeful note to Beulah and enclose a few dollars and thus weigh in for rectitude . The note written , in care of Smitty 's , and fifteen dollars enclosed , he felt better . He would feel still better if Frank Brobeck canvassed the courthouse on the chance there was a job for her there . 149 O  | Skeeter Jerome , so named because he resembled a gnat , sat in the outer office , telephone to his ear , and with a thumb motioned Ben back . Brobeck was at his desk , papers before him and a mangled cigar in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hi , Horace Greeley . " " Howdy , high sheriff . " " Glad to see you , Ben , but I got nothin ' much for your news nose today . Have a seat . " " Fine morning . " " Yeah , but by the looks of you you did n't come to talk about weather . Something on your mind , Ben ? Something weighty ? " " Something you might help with . " " Yours truly . Spill it . " Ben looked toward the connecting door and saw that he 'd closed it and then told about Beulah Sanders . " I wondered , " he said in conclusion , " if maybe you could scout up a job for her here ? " Brobeck had listened , his cigar held still in his teeth , his ugly , not-ugly face grooved as always . Then he said , " What 's the lady 's name ? " " Did I forget that ? " " Shit , Ben . What is it ? You protectin ' her fair reputation ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigar from his mouth , shook his head , bowed it in his hands and shook it some more . " Jesus loves me , " he said . " Why say that ? " " Beulah Sanders ! " " You know her ? " " Innocence is a trap , Ben , and maybe a sin . " " You 're speaking of her ? " " No , for God 's sake ! You . " Brobeck shook his head again . A smile that might have been rueful touched his mouth . " Bawlin ' Beulah . Little bawlin ' Beulah . She hooked you . Been hookin ' the innocent right along . You 're a sucker , Ben . " " Thanks . "  | " You 're welcome . But back to the case . That poor , little , innocent girl that tore your heart so , she 's been whorin ' at Big Tit Lil 's for more'n a year . Now , when trade gets slow , she hoofs off up the road and plays sorrowful . The locals know her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the word , because that would jinx a legitimate business . " Ben looked away . He heard a sigh go out of him that was more like an exhaustion of lungs . " Now , " Brobeck went on , " them as do n't know , like you , pick her up and get sympathetic , bein ' she 's so alone in the world and so close to sin . Way it winds up , most of ' em fuck her in the interests of purity , give her a nice piece of money and tell her now to be a good girl ? until they come by again , that is . " Brobeck 's eyes peered from their fretwork of wrinkles . " No , I guess you did n't , Ben . " " I did n't . " " I believe you . But you gave her money . Even sent her a note today . Signed , too , I bet . " Ben nodded . " Want your money back , and the note to boot ? " " Forget it ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holy temple was wrecked . It 's just your innocence suffers . " " I 'm a sucker . " " But a good sucker , Ben . Do n't forget it . " " Why do n't you shut down all the houses ? " " Now , now , Ben . Do n't get riled . There 's arguments both ways . No one 's payin ' me to let ' em stay open . Best of a bad choice is what I say . " Skeeter Jerome stuck his head in the door . " Sheriff , you made a note to remind you of that Sportsmen 's Club feed . " " Thanks , Skeeter. 1 ' 11 be there . " After Jerome had closed the door , Ben said , " I know you 're not being paid . " " Well , the hell with the whole subject then . You remember when I talked about huntin ' ? "  | " Some time ago . " " It 's all set up now . Jap York will outfit and guide us . None @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spence Green wants to go , and there 's you and me , and then our friend , Mr. Earl Kilmer . How does that strike you ? " " All right . " " You do n't even hear me . " " I said all right . It 's your party . " " Aw , let the son of a bitch come along . Ca n't hurt , even if we both got our eyes on the Senate . " " I 'm not sure I 'll go . I do n't care about killing . " " Who says you have to shoot anythin ' . Just tail along . " " Maybe . " " Make it yes . Ben , I can see things are gnawin ' on you . Your face has forgot how to smile . You have to get away , by God , and look at the sky and feel the breeze and fill your belly with camp food and get a taste of freedom from all shifty fret . " " Lecture ended ? " " Nigh onto . Yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smart enough to see that , and it 's not just Beulah Sanders and your bleedin ' innocence , but I ai n't curious . What I want is the old Ben . " He looked at his watch . " Time we went to that lunch . " Walking to the Arfive House , Ben felt demeaned and betrayed and , more than that , foolish . A smart man , he was , a knowledgeable editor , a contributor to rectitude where no rectitude was . A silly son of a bitch , full of innocence , brimming with sperm , thinking of Mary Jess , thinking of Pat Herlihy , a man with no answers and no right to opinions . But he could act . Tonight he would skip the Lions Club , buy a bottle and , briefcase in hand , call on Pat Herlihy . She might think him witless but conclude he had other credentials . Ile slid into bed , trying not to disturb Mary Jess . But she moved closer to him and murmured , " Ben , " and did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was willing to make her  | belated concession . His mind could hear Pat Herlihy saying , " Skip the preliminaries , Ben . I 'm a self-starter . " And later in the night she was saying , with emphasis on the last word , " Good God , Ben , do n't you ever get any ? " He patted Mary Jess 's shoulder and moved away . And now it was he who could say , and say truly , with a pleasure that pained him , " I 'm too tired tonight , dear . "  | MR . COLLINGSWORTH placed a red queen on a black king and let the deck rest in his hand . He had never liked card games , in fact had avoided them , but someone ? who was it now ? ? had taught him Klondike , which he said was one version of solitaire , and it was a way to pass quiet hours . In one picture at the back of the flat desk on which he played , May was smiling on him . Her mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Having fun , Benton ? " The other pictures , standing on dresser and shelf where he could see them from his bed , showed gentleness , too , but not so much of amusement . " Burning daylight , Maysie , " he said to himself . " That 's what Jack London would call it . " He ought to be making preparations for the beginning of school . There were still things to be done , but a full staff had been engaged , had arrived and been interviewed , and he had no stomach for detail today . Better to sit quiet and fool away time with the cards . The summer days were always quiet , what with no school to attend and Ben and Mary Jess out of the house . In older times he would have had a fishing rod in his hand and his eyes on a trout hole , but fishing was , after all , only fishing , and good roads and automobiles and more anglers made decent catches infrequent . Another picture was chiding him , saying , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in his chair . He answered in silence , " But , Maysie , I 'm older . Things are n't what they were . No , not with me and not with the country . It used to be good fishing was only a short hike away . Used to be . "  | He slid a card from the deck , saw there was no play and again held the deck idle . Change , he thought . Years . Time . There was never a now to seize and hold still . It slipped past the tongue and became then in the moment of saying . A man trying to grasp it felt it slide through his hands and hook him and carry him into new nows that were n't nows because now never was . The world was a world of thens , of back-whens , of used-to-bes . Time swept on , hurrying a man along with it , and the only beacons he sighted were those long left behind . The long afternoon sunlight shone through the west window . It , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Night would return , but it would be a new night , different from all nights before . And the unsettled weather of the equinox would return , not as it ever had been . There was no play for the red four or the black . Pity for them to be buried when the prospect was good . " Sorry thinking , " he said without words and went on thinking . The smiling face on the desk understood . Time was the great thief , the slow , sure taker of all . Of the school board that had hired him in those green years of long ago only Mort Ewing survived . The others ? old Mr. Sterling McLaine , Jay Ross , Merc Marsh ? one by one they had been subtracted from days remembered . Friends , the old , certain friends beside whom later ones paled ? The Stuart Alexanders were gone , and their great house to the west of town stood blind and vacant , its lower floor the retreat of horses and cattle in bad weather and fly time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right existed , to the socialist world that he believed Jesus Christ preached . Smoky Moreau , the mystic Indian , drawn off to the happy hunting grounds . And Macalester Cleveland , the neglected , whose removal time had celebrated with a blaze of pure light . A man could even regret the loss of his enemies . Almost alone of old friends , besides Ewing , Doctor Crabtree remained , weathered as a piece of discarded harness . He gathered the deck and shuffled , saying but not saying , " Just one more , Maysie. "  | There had been laughter in those days , laughter and hearty talk and feasts to founder a man . It was then as if everything were at the beginning and ahead lay the ripe world . Thirty-four years , he thought while he surveyed the new layout of cards . Thirty-four years of trying to teach simple manners and excite intellectual curiosity in incurious rowdies , in gum-chewers and bubblegum-blowers and glandular showoffs . Was the cultural level elevated as a result of his labors ? How many , given the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A few , a dear few , to the second . They were the great and scanty reward . He made a play . The downing sun shone longer in the room . " The years that the locust hath eaten , ' " he said , not aloud , to a photograph on the shelf . He rose and stepped to the west window , the unturned cards in his hand , and looked to the mountains . The base of Elephant Ear Butte , which ignorant upstarts were calling Ear Mountain these days , lay shadowed by its own height under the sinking sun , but the summit was crowned with light . How often had he looked at it , finding some kind of assurance there , knowing that at least one thing endured ? Let people , seeing him , wonder at this attraction to stone . He would n't explain , if he could . It was there , and he was here , close by , a partner to what the locusts could n't devour . So , he thought , sitting down again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days . There are sunup and high noon and evening star and night . A placid , tranquil life , easing along to the end . There was a slow vexation . Tranquillity . A tranquil house , a tranquil daughter , a tranquil son-in-law . Even were Charles back from Columbia , he would only add to the unrelieved atmosphere . There were no storms in this house and no aftermaths of sweet calm . Lives cruised along at dead level . Once he had had a temper and had exercised it , to both his regret and gratification . He was still edgy and always would be , but his temper , so easily fired in past years , had given way to a controlled irritation . Call him tranquil , too . he turned the ace of spades and put it up . This dead house needed children , no matter how pesky . It  | needed shouts and thumps and tears and laughter . Children to love and enjoy , to share living with , to direct and shape and forge and be proud of . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a picture . Where , Mary Jess ? Where , Ben ? Are careers so important ? Is your love not love , then ? " Maysie , " he said silently while his gaze went from picture to picture , " We knew , did n't we ? We had a better life , did n't we ? Tell me it 's so . If only you had n't had to go on ! " Now , aloud , he said , " I loved you so , Maysie . " For an instant , in the lowering beam of the sun , Doctor Crabtree appeared , stern as God , and May lay dead in their bed . Doctor Crabtree was asking , " How many pregnancies , Mr. Collingsworth ? How many live births ? How many miscarriages ? " Then the stern mouth , suddenly torn , said , " I wore out one wife myself . " Mr. Collingsworth seized a handful of cards and flung back his hand to throw into the shaft of sun . Then he placed them quietly on his desk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these mornings , " Frank Brobeck said . " Fine weather , though , " Ben answered . " Yeah , but not for elk hunting . No snow , no tracks . " They rode in Brobeck 's pickup , which was loaded with huntingtrip gear . The first light was just striking the high tips of the mountains , and Brobeck switched off the car lights and switched them back on , for the morning 's mist hovered low . Snow showed on the peaks and in the high crevices twenty miles to the west , but lower down the Rockies were dark , for this little time holding their secrets against the eye of the sun . No wind stirred , and the dust of the day before had settled , not to be disturbed again until workers started out for the dam . " I bet those damn two , Kilmer and Green , will hang back until the horses are packed , " Brobeck said . His face showed good humor , though the dawn light shadowed its furrows . " Do n't matter , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I 'll help where I can . " " Sure . Sure . " Brobeck turned to smile . " But you 're just along for the ride . Which reminds me , just why did you bring that light rifle ? No open season on deer this year . " " I told you it was the only one in the house . Some rancher , gone broke , gave it to Mr. Collingsworth for clerking an auction . " " Which do n't exactly answer my question , since you do n't intend to shoot anything . " ' That 's for the others to find out , but everyone will have a gun , everyone on this trip . "  | Brobeck smiled again . " Did n't want to be plumb out of style , huh ? " " Something like that . " " Like goin ' to a birthday party with nothin ' in hand ? Like bein ' found bare-assed at a fancy-dress ball ? " " All right , Frank . " In the distance , at the darn site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gleamed from a crane . The sunshine was inching down the slopes now , and the humps and gashes of construction loomed dark , like giant animals stricken , Ben thought , like creatures , gouged , that lived before man . Looking , Brobeck said , " Say , Ben , you heart and soul , so to speak , for the darn ? Hundred percent , I mean ? " " You ought to know . I 've been plugging it long enough . " " Yeah , for irrigation to begin with . But this ai n't for irrigation . Just flood control , and it do n't hold up to argument . " " Irrigation will follow , do n't you worry . Meantime men have work . " " Oh , sure , and I 'm all for that , and you know it . It 's a poor dish , empty bellies are . But still the dam means sayin ' so long , so long to the runs and holes we used to fish , so long to huntin ' grounds and campin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But if every change is goodbye to what was , it 's hello to something new and something better . At least we can believe so . You 've got me preaching now , but we ca n't say no to the future . If the first men in the West had said no , there 'd be no Montana , no Arfive . " " Which , I guess , would n't have bothered them much . Remember , I 'm with you , but you run a newspaper and so got to be up in the collar . " Brobeck was right enough . A good newspaper stood against stagnancy . It had to concern itself with community welfare , to look ahead , to encourage , to promote . To back President Roosevelt , if it came to that . To support the authorities and administrations he had brought into being , makeshift and disorganized and in need of refinement as they might be . The man aimed at the general good .  | Into his thought Brobeck said , as a by-the-way , " The Indians tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neither can we , and we should n't want to . Sure , the past has its charms , but the future is what we make of it and can be better than anything yet , but we ca n't make anything of it by balking at change . " " You 're preaching , sure enough . All right , no balk . " And yet , Ben thought , and yet . It was a sorry condition of life that change always had to tow a trailer of goodbye , that every gain entailed a loss . It was sorrier yet that every choice , big or little , had to be burdened with regret . Or with a load of guilt . Take himself , he thought as the pickup bumped along . Only with Mattie Murchison had he felt free of guilt , but there had been a choice there , a choice of marriage no matter what she said , and he had made the choice and come to know a lingering regret . Which might be why he seldom made a point of calling on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago , she told him Mattie had a good job but had lost her husband . Or take himself and Patricia Herlihy . Freed by Mary Jess , he had lain with Pat by choice , not once but often , and as a consequence had become an undemanding husband , and Mary Jess was happy with him , perhaps suspecting but not knowing why the change . There was a gain of sorts . But gain or not and freedom or not , the choice had burdened him with guilt , as recollection of it did this minute . To sneak up back stairways ! To feign business meetings ! To arrange secret pickups at dark corners and take furtive drives ! Great conduct for a married man with respect for the proprieties . It was some small comfort to have learned that guilt piled on guilt made the first inconsequential and the last less onerous . He hitched in his seat . He could n't make that choice again or feel that latest guilt again , for Pat was leaving town , appointed to a better station at Butte @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ footing of the dam and remembered to turn off his head lamps . The light on the crane had gone out . The fury of the day ? roar and clatter of machinery , voices , dust , blasts in resisting stone , gouged and tum- bling earth ? would begin soon . Now the monsters of machinery slept , and the only noise was the noise of the pickup , the only dust the dust stirred by its wheels , the only voices his and Frank 's when they chose to speak . Brobeck said , " Kind of spooky , is n't it ? Like ghosts , those machines are , but nights are the time for ghosts . These start rattlin ' their chains with the sun . " Above the dam site , away from the noise and movement to be , York had the horses tied up , five saddled and ten under pack harness . He said , " Howdy . Where you been all day ? And where 's the rest ? " His eyes had the bright , squinted gleam of a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could see game where others could n't . " Comin ' along , " Brobeck answered . " We got the gear with us , or most of it . " " You wo n't get it unloaded , sittin ' there at the wheel . We can mante up . " From the pickup Brobeck and Ben took sleeping bags , food , ammunition , their rifles in scabbards , binoculars , heavy clothes , camp utensils , a tent , a folded-up camp stove . Some of the items made York remark , " Jesus Christ , why all the plunder ? I said bring clothes , grub , glasses and your rifles . Think I 'm a two-bit outfitter ? " Brobeck gave him his plowed-face smile . " Just afraid you might be runnin ' shy , Jap . If it was just you , you 'd make your fire with a couple of sticks , cook your meat on a willow stick , feed your face by hand , rump up on a rock for a bed and howl at the moon . " York went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He said , " Help mante up , you smart-ass sheriff as never caught anything but the clap . " They assorted the items and , save for rifles , ammunition and binoculars , laid them on canvas squares and wrapped and roped them with a dexterity Ben could only watch and admire . Then , with equal dexterity , they lifted the packs to the pack horses , balanced the loads and made their hitches . They had just finished when Spence Green and Earl Kilmer  | drove up . After greetings they brought their own rifles , ammunition , extra clothing and glasses from the car and with them a carton that held half a case of whiskey . " Well , now , " York said , seeing the whiskey , " we 'll call it square , your bein ' late , seein ' as you brung a necessity . I 'll even thank you , for it gets boresome waitin ' at the still . " Kilmer was uncorking a bottle . He said , " You ought to know . " The reference was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took the bottle and drank . " It was thirsts like yours drove me to it . " When the bottle got back to Kilmer , he lifted it and said , " Here 's to the one good thing I can say for the New Deal . Repeal . But if Roosevelt cuts the dollar any lower , it 's back to the still for you , Jap . " York shook his head . " Too deep for me , boys . Spendin ' ourselves broke so as to be prosperous . " While he made a pack of the whiskey and extra clothes the two men had brought and hitched it on a horse , the others waited . Since those days of ten years ago Earl Kilmer 's face , once so smooth and pure in the possession of right , had grown a fine fret of wrinkles . They gave him the appearance of a quizzical humor until you looked in his eyes , which were unsmiling and fixed on unrevealed goals . Time had n't changed the essential man , Ben reflected , except to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be what he was , a pharmacist and drugstore owner careful with prescriptions both medical and financial . A good enough man , pale from his store 's shelter and grown a little too fat . ' Bout ready , " York called as he examined the packs . Here , down in the canyon , the night 's chill hung on , untouched yet by the sunshine on the shouldering mountains . The mountains rose all around , their bases blue-dark in the gathering light . A growth of aspens strung along a ridge began to gleam in dull gold . Except for clumps of wild daisies the flowers of summer were gone , the broad-leaf fireweed along the bank shrunken  | to a tangle of stems . Some chokecherries hung purple on a bush that had lost most of its leaves . Where grass grew , the frost whitened it . An old man 's stubble of beard on the face of Mother Earth , Ben thought , feeling the chill push through his clothes . He moved , and the stubble crunched under foot . " Climb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saddle horse , and Brobeck said to Ben , " Tenderfoot , see your cinch is snug and try out your stirrups for length . " Ben answered , " Thanks , Frank , " though he knew that much without being told . They set off , York in the lead with a string of five pack horses , then Brobeck with five , then Kilmer , then Green . Ben was well content to be at the tail . Looking behind him to see all was in order , York called to Ben , " Just twelve  --  fourteen miles . Stick ass to saddle , boy . " The trail led through willows , through cottonwoods , through pines , through little clearings , rising and falling , leaving the stream and returning . The sun climbed over the mountains and shone gently at first , then so hot that Ben , like the others ahead , pulled to a stop , dismounted , took off his coat and tied it in back of the saddle . Mile by slow mile the stream dwindled . Where the trail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , weasel-swift in alarm . Then there was no more stream but a swampy spring and near it bright falls of water from last winter 's snow pack . They let the horses drink there . Above the spring they came to a mountain of coarse shale , an unsurmountable mountain , so high that a man had to arch his back and strain his neck to see its top ; and the trail tackled it by switchbacks , narrow switchback on switchback , the hairpin turns so acute that each horse almost had to double back on itself . Gazing down while he let his horse choose its footing , Ben could imagine a slide , one that would tumble man and horse down and bury them and bury the spring and rumble to rest , damming the canyon without help of machine . Here , near the summit , he could look eastward over the tops of  | the mountains they had snaked through and see the sunny plains stretching to the horizon and their small dottings of homesteads and wheat elevators . At the summit York held up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they had climbed , and his mouth moved , saying words that Ben could n't make out . Were they , " Look well . Look well while you can " ? Ben looked , to the meanders of the stream , to the small parks , to the brush and trees that , wanting water , drank from the river and in time would be drowned . From this height all appeared diminished , delicate and dear as a child 's careful construction , not to be disturbed by the meddling of grownups . Even so . Even so . Better to restore bounce to life than to leave things as they were because they were what they were . Better to spend yourself broke so as to be prosperous . If you could do so . If only you could . Decision again . Choice again . And again loss . The horses were getting their wind back . They were wet and lathered with sweat , and the smell of it seemed almost visible . They angled down the divide into the drainage of the Medicine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How much longer ? His seat felt raw , and his knees permanently sprung by the stretch of the saddle . But it was plod after plod after tormenting plod , and his head thudded to the steps of his horse ; and this was vacation , all this , vacation from work , time off from troubles , time on for high spirits . Then the horses quickened pace , and at last they arrived at a pole corral beside which lay a few canvas-covered bundles of what must be hay . Off to the side was an irregular circle of fireblackened stones . The sun had made its swing and , gentle again , shone from the west , just above farther mountains . York rode his horse to a pole , dismounted and tied up . He and Brobeck knew what to do with the packs and horses , and Kilmer stood ready to help . After unsaddling his horse and freeing it inside the corral , Ben started rustling firewood . From one of the lashings Green had taken an ax . He breathed hard as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground , York led the unsaddled horses inside the corral , let them roll , hobbled a couple , hung bells on two more and let down the gate . Stooping to light the fire , Ben heard the thump and clump of hooves and the jangling of bells as the bunch surged out to graze . Once the packs were brought close to the fire , York rummaged and took out the bottle they had drunk from before . " Tea time , " he said , uncorking it . " Tea time if only you , Ben , would run to the crick and get a bucket of water . The straight stuff closes my pipes . " There was nothing like a good drink , once it settled , to straighten sprung knees , Ben thought as he passed the tin cup . York scanned the sky and said , " No snow tonight , but we best pitch a tent . It 's a sucker 's game , bettin ' with nature that holds all the aces . Want to lend a hand ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Good . You know where the grub is . " They ate fried potatoes and onions , steaks broiled on an open grill , and drank coffee that Ben had let boil , knowing they wanted it strong . Chocolate bars did for dessert . York took whiskey instead . Afterwards they sat around the fire , smoking , occasionally feeding the little blaze , feeling the night 's chill enclose them now that the sun had gone down . The moon bulged the eastern horizon and grew into a great , golden disc , and the camp and the mountains assumed outline and detail . " The way it is , " York said , " us outfitters each of us got our territories pretty well fixed . Not strict , you understand , but still more or less . That do n't mean that outside parties ca n't hunt here , amateur parties , I mean , but most of them are too busy makin ' heap big wages at the dam and catchin ' up on debts to their bellies . " Ben saw the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news to them . " What you do n't know , " York continued , " is that this year , not like last year or the years before , the elk voted for my territory . Or more'n a few did on account of the graze , not bein ' grazed off , had  | got better here . It 'll take careful huntin ' , but there 's elk around . " " I 'm heading up the Medicine in the morning , " Kilmer said , not as if he desired company . " I know where . " The moonlight and firelight exaggerated the fine fret of his wrinkles . " I 'll take out for Beaver Creek , " Brobeck announced . " How about it , Spence ? " " Sure , but that leaves Ben . " " I 'll tend camp , " Ben said . " Me'n you both , " York put in . " Now I 've got whiskey and found me a cook , I figure to loaf . " Brobeck edged a few sticks into the fire . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver . The step-by-step ring of the horse bells sounded soft in the night . " One other thing , " York said , his eyes on the fire . " There 's an old she-grizzly around . I hope you remember we 're not huntin ' bears . " Kilmer asked , " Why not ? It 's legal . " " She come here last year from the Yellowstone country or maybe the Flathead with a gimp in her leg where somebody shot her , and she 's old and alone , and there ai n't many of her kind around anywhere anymore ? not anymore ? and I guess she do n't see much future before her . It all makes her pretty short in her temper . " " What 's that got to do with it ? " Kilmer asked . York kept looking at the fire , and it struck Ben that he might be equating himself with the bear as the losing survivor of change .
