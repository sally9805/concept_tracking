With mounting anger , Richard Nixon summoned an aide to confirm the accuracy of the item he was reading in the weekend news digest prepared for him . Then he lost his customary cool . " It was a sight to behold . His face turned red with anger ; he banged his fist on the arm of his chair . I 've seldom seen him so furious , " reported one man in the room . " Those idiots , those fools-brainless bureaucrats ! " Nixon fumed . " This is outrageous , this is inhuman , this is going to wreck the image of the country . " <P> What had so enraged the President was an incident off Cape Cod in U.S. waters that had occurred on Nov. 23 . In a series of monumental gaffes , the Coast Guard had first refused asylum to a defecting Soviet sailor , then permitted Russian seamen to board a U.S. cutter , beat the would-be defector into unconsciousness before the eyes of the crew , then return with him-in a Coast Guard launch-to a waiting Soviet vessel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President did not see reports of the incident until a week later . By then , much of what took place had been pieced together . <P> Alert Goes Up . The stage for the defection attempt was a previously arranged rendezvous-to discuss fishing rights-off the coast of Martha 's Vineyard between the Coast Guard cutter Vigilant and the Soviet refrigerated fishing ship Sovietskaya Litva . The talks were just under way aboard the Sovietskaya Litva when a crew member approached one of the Americans and said that he wanted to defect . <P> Word was quickly passed to the Vigilant 's skipper , Commander Ralph Eustis , who in turn radioed the news to his superior , Rear Admiral William B. Ellis , in Boston . From there , the alert went up to Coast Guard headquarters in Washington and finally , at 2:30 p.m. , to the Russian affairs desk of the State Department . The deskman instructed the Coast Guard not to entice the sailor , but under any circumstances to " keep me apprised " of what happens next . <P> Fought Desperately . According to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the deck of the Coast Guard cutter at 4:30 p.m. and pleaded for sanctuary . When informed of the situation , Admiral Ellis reportedly directed the ship 's commander to follow " normal " procedure for dealing with stowaway crew members from another vessel . Such procedure stipulates that the skipper of the ship from which the sailor jumps must give a written request for the return of his man . <P> Though he apparently argued the decision for several hours , Commander Eustis complied with Ellis ' order , and three Russian sailors were allowed to board the Vigilant to take Kudirka back . But he fought desperately , and pleaded with the Americans to let him stay . Recalls Robert Brieze , one of the U.S. fishing experts who was aboard the Coast Guard cutter : " He was crying ' Help ! ' and was on his knees praying and begging them to save his life . The Russians came aboard . Sometimes I could n't see him , but I could hear him crying . Then he ran to the upper deck . His face was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
