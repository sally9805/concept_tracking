Confusion in Caracas gives opportunities to the cartel 's customers <P> While Venezuelan air force helicopters whirred in the sky above and 5,000 soldiers patrolled on the ground below , armed motorcades wound through the clogged streets of Caracas . It was a typical Panavision entrance for the 13 oil ministers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries . The price-fixing cartel that had tiptoed onto the stage of international power politics a decade earlier was gathering amidst pomp , pageantry and supertight security to do what it had learned to do best : demand more money . <P> The members did just that . But after the most fractious meeting in OPEC 's history-it was a " bazaar " in the scoffing description of Saudi Arabia 's Oil Minister , Ahmed Zaki Yamani-the cartel failed to agree on any uniform price . Instead , each country will fix the cost of its crude . The cartel also failed to set limits on production , as some of its hawks sorely want to do . In fact , the divisions were sharp enough to raise questions about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rises will cause immediate pain to the rest of the world , they also present an opportunity for oil-importing nations to counter OPEC by cutting demand . Market forces , the law of supply and demand , will have a much bigger influence than before . <P> After four days of dispute , the meeting in Caracas broke up with hard-line hawks such as Iran , Libya , Nigeria and Algeria planning to charge a minimum of $28.50 per bbl. and perhaps $30 or even more , while other cartel members said that they intended to go no higher than $24 . All in all , the rises add up to a big increase over the OPEC official maximum of $23.50 that had prevailed since summer , the $18 that Saudi Arabia , the cartel 's leading producer , had posted until two weeks ago , and the $12.90 that OPEC averaged a year ago . <P> The U.S. is already suffering increasing economic upset from energy inflation , and now the malaise will worsen . According to Administration calculations , the cost of crude oil imported into the U.S. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to from $28 to $30 . Several of the nation 's most important OPEC suppliers , including Nigeria and Libya , are also among those that lifted their prices the most . <P> The projected increases are expected to raise the nation 's oil import bill from about $62 billion this year to more than $83 billion , representing a rise in fuel costs of $80 for every American citizen . The increase , said Energy Secretary Charles Duncan , could add from 4 to 8 to the retail price of a gallon of gasoline in the coming weeks , and 3 to 7 to the cost of home heating oil , a major expense for consumers in the import-dependent Northeast . Several of the largest oil companies , including Exxon , Mobil , Chevron and Texaco , last week announced wholesale gasoline price increases of 6 to 10 per gal . This signals further sharp rises at the pump in the weeks ahead for motorists , who are already paying an average nationwide price of about $1.04 per gal .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
