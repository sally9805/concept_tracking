txt PIKEVILLE , Ky. ? county Judge Wayne Rutherford folded his hands across his belly , swiveled his chair to face the law books , and offered his personal lament on the subject of wealth and his lack of it . " I would 've been a millionaire now like the rest of them if my granddaddy had n't sold his coal land for 50 cents an acre to an out-of-town landlord . " lie gazed beyond his office walls for minutes , then shook off the wistfulness Photos on the Back Page of what might have been and brought his head back to Pikeville , population 5,000 , capital of Pike County , a town of millionaires , Cadillacs , and Rolls-Royces , of $200,000 houses and swimming pools , and above all , a town of coal . Here , hi the largest underground coal producing county in the nation , coal is mined , sorted , cleaned , and put on the block at the highest rate , about $25 a ton , because it is simply the best grade of coal in the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rub shoulders with unemployed miners and fast-moving salesmen come from the North to hunt for the money . There is an overwhelming aura of immediate riches about the place  --  new money , $240 million of it , stashed away in the town 's three banks ; row after row of gleaming Cadillacs ; acre upon acre of custom-built houses ; and gallon after gallon of azure swimming pools . The unsuspecting stranger can hit this town on a sleepy Sunday night and be lucky to find a handful of people taking the evening air , but it Is the only night a hotel room can be found . " There 's no point in coming here during the week unless you 've booked a room months in advance , " ? warns the night clerk at the Landmark Hotel , the largest of six hotels in the town . " Get up early in the morning if you want to avoid 40,000 people here , and do n't take your car into town , " he says . SURE ENOUGH , conic 8 a.m . Monday , traffic is backed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interstate highway . These are ' ' the persuaders , " salesmen of heavy machinery , office supplies , food , clothing , trucks . . . anything . And the coal brokers , men looking for coal deals at the best rate , deals that will make them and the local mine owners very rich . Regald Smith , a local banker and president of the Pike County Chamber of Commerce , cheerfully acknowledges the existence of " at least 100 million // Column 1 Black gold ? That 's coal in Kentucky // afros in the town and a lot of paper millionaires as well . " " We are , " he says , " in the unique position of having a lot of money and , at the moment , nothing to do with it . We ca n't build up the town fast enough , we have no place to go . " IRONICALLY , HE and other business leaders blame the very source of the wealth for many of their problems . ? " It 's the mountains that are holding us back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those , can we ? " " Certainly not , " the mine owners said . " Why do n't we move the river instead ? " End of problem . The horseshoeshaped river that runs across the back of the town will be diverted , and Pikeville 's extension eventually will be snaked around the foot of the mountains . NO ONE IS sure how this town came to catch all the apples , but the politician offered his view . " We got rid of the carpetbaggers , that 's what happened , " Judge Rutherford huffed . " The coal finally belongs to its rightful owners , the people who live here , and they deserve it . " The government is still crippling us , though . This county paid the state government $100 million in taxes this year . It goes to other parts of the state for welfare when it should come back here . " Rutherford refused to acknowledge the existence of poverty In the county . IVIIETHER . HE likes it or not , poverty stands cheek by jowl with the money . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mile from the banks and within shouting distance of out-of-work miners , some crippled with black lung disease , crowding the streets , trading and selling whittling knives on the pavements outside city hall . THERE 'S SUSPICION of strangers in town , and word has spread that questions are being asked about " the millionaires . " Three of them are standing on the show lot of Childers and Vendors , the Cadillac dealer , waiting to go to lunch with the owner and passing the time flipping quarters for $20 a throw . Two , In their mid-30s , are coal bro. kers , and the third , a mere 32 , sold his small mine last year for more than $1 million and now considers himself retired . They refuse to be photographed or to talk about their millions , but whispered stories from Eddie Vendors , the Cadillac dealer , tell of impulsive trips to Las Vegas , private planes , and credit lines of up to $50,000 at the Vegas gambling tables . THAT 'S THE new money , and " it wo n't last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young owners keep selling their mines to the big companies . " Canada , 58 , is well-qualified to pass judgment on money and its uses . He owns the Canada Coal Co. in Kemper , about 20 miles south of Pikeville , and at ' last reckoning was worth about $500 million . There is a touch of the country squire about him , reinforced by the recent purchase of a $410,000 colt . It will stand well with his herd of prize Charolais cattle worth up to $60,000 a head , a $500,000 barn on his 9,000 acres near Moorehead , Ky. , his 26 racehorses , and his multimillion-dollar home being built along the Kemper coal valley . For transport he uses one of several Rolls-Royces or a 1929 V-12 lime-green Cadillac . Ho quietly scorns participation in Pikeville 's social life , preferring his valley or his farm , and warns that the town despite its present boom , has not seen the last of depression days . AND THAT is the specter that dances around Pikeville 's wealth . Despite the rush of money , local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all boom towns : Maybe the coal will disappear ; maybe the prices will suddenly drop ; maybe nobody will want coal in the future ; maybe the Arabs will be more reasonable about their oil . In the meantime , Pikeville 's dollars are spread around the good things of life , and potential investors stand in line , waiting for a river to be rearranged around the coal mountains that dictate the fate of rich and poor alike .
