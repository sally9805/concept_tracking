txt Agriculture Department was to reveal Tuesday that retail food prices could rise as fast during the first half of next year as they have risen this year . Supermarket prices thru June could go up at an annual rate of 15 per cent , " barring a sharp collapse in domestic and world demand , " said J. Dawson Ahalt , a staff economist , in a speech prepared for delivery at the annual National Agricultural Outlook Conference sponsored by the department . Ellen Zawel , president of the National Consumers Congress , said in response to Ahalt 's prepared address , " The prospects of another 15 to 20 per cent increase in food prices is mindboggling . " FOOD PRICES last year jumped 14.5 per cent and have increased about another 15 per cent so far this year . A year ago , the department predicted a 12 per cent increase during 1974 . However , poor harvests reduced supply and increased prices . Ahalt said prospects are " highly uncertain " for the last half of 1975 , when aconomists again hope for bumper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U. S. and around the world , and economic activity weakens more than expected , production increases relative to demand growth could be quite large , leading to significant slowing in price levels , " " Conversely , with world grain stocks at precariously low levels , another year of poor growing conditions , at a time when world food needs are expanding , could ignite a rapid pace of food price advances thruout 1975 . Ahalt said additional increases in processing , distributing , and marketing costs will add to pressure on prices . But he predicted such increases wit be more in line with overall price trends than they have been this year , when middlemen have accounted for 14 per cent of increase in retail prices . ZAWEL BLASTED the department in her response , saying , " Retail prices are merely the naxious tip of an iceberg whose foundation has been systematically ignored by myopic decision-makers . " She said food inflation is fueled by " the interplay of supply and demand factors and the costly structure of the domestic food delivery system .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
