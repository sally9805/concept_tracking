Using sex against bugs <P> In the war between bugs and man , the bugs have lately had the upper hand . Making a comeback from their near defeat after World War II by DDT and other chemical formulations , insects have become immune to many pesticides ; their lot has also been made easier by the banning of many bug killers that are harmful to health and environment . As a result , insects are again on the march , spreading disease and inflicting costly damage on crops and forests . But now man is about to unleash a new and Machiavellian weapon against which bugs seemingly have no defense : sex . <P> For the first time , the Environmental Protection Agency has approved for commercial use as a pesticide an insect sex pheromone , the scent emitted by a female to attract males . The new substance , being marketed by Albany International under the trade name Gossyplure H.F. , is actually a synthesized version of the scent given off by female pink bollworm moths . These insects produce caterpillars that eat their way through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmers some $40 million a year in damage and control expenses . <P> Gossyplure proves the old adage that nothing succeeds like excess . When it is sprayed on a cotton field , it so saturates the air with female pink bollworm moth pheromone that the male moths sometimes go on indiscriminate sex orgies . They try to mate with sticks , stones , vegetation or anything else in the vicinity . However they react , they are seldom able to find the available females ; they soon become so accustomed to the scent that they no longer respond to it . The result : a sharp drop in the population of caterpillar young - and crop damage . In field tests near Blythe , Calif. , last year , only 10% of cotton crops treated with Gossyplure were damaged , compared with 80% in unsprayed areas . <P> Gossyplure won EPA approval after laboratory tests showed that it was harmless to humans , wildlife and vegetation and had no effect on other species of insects . ( Standard chemical sprays used on cotton fields also kill insects that are beneficial to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak , that the bollworm could evolve immunity to its own sex pheromone-for example , by producing a different scent . But scientists could then synthesize the new pheromone and continue to control the frustrated moths .
