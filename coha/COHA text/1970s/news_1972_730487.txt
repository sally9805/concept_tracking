txt The Chicago Board of Elec. tion Commissioners has beer using maintenance on its 6,201 election machines to pad pay rolls at a cost of hundreds of thousands of dollars each year to taxpayers . The Tribune hat learned . The scandal-ridden Election Board , headed by Stanley T. Kusper Jr. , has $400,000 budgeted this year to pay 52 election machine servicemen for 6,200 machines  --  a ratio of one man for every 120 machines . In 1971 , the board budgeted $416 , - 000 but paid its 52 maintenance men and supervisors $423,000. to maintain the machines . A Tribune study of the Election Department of Cook Coun-1 ty , and those in other Midwest cities with similar machines , i has shown , however , that one ! full-time man can maintain a minimum of 422 machines and , in one case , 1,000 machines . Using those ratios , the Chicago Election Board could I have saved a minimum of $200,000 in the last two years ? with proper management . In January , a Tribune Task Force series on tax waste in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Election Department of County Clerk Edward Barrett that presently exists in the City Board of Election . The county Election Department , with 3,300 machines , was hiring one man per 122 machines each year . As a result of Task Force revelations , the County Board immediately slashed its payroll from 27 to 4 men , a drastic cut before an election . A study commissioned by the board after the series confirmed Tribune charges of payroll padding . The study made by the Jacobs Company , a Chicago management consulting firm , has recommended that the county Election Department hire only 9 fulltime men to maintain the 3,500 machines , or one man per 422 machines . San De Carl , supervisor of the Chicago Board of Election maintenance division , said that his machines , manufactured by Automatic Voting Machine Company ( A. V. M. of New York , can not be compared with the county mac h i n e s because they have more vertical columns for canAidates . However , Mrs. Marie T. %uthers , minority commissioner on the Election Board , ' barged that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been ed . Wants a Study " I 've often wondered what those maintenance men do there , " she said . " You can only polish the machines so many times . " Mrs. Suthers , the only Republican member of the board , said she would welcome a complete management study of the maintenance division of the board similar to the one made in the county Election Department . Work production figures submitted to the city Budget Department as statistics to back up requests for payrolls in the Election Board do not reflect the actual time put into the machines . The budget figures allege that 10.88 hours of work will be put into one machine in 1972 . DeCarl told The Tribune that 2% to three hours of work will go into each machine during each of the two elections . That is no more than six hours of work for the year . A spokesman for A.V.M. estimated that the maximum amount of time put into one machine for an election , if all the columns were used , would be three hours . Repair Time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were needed to repair and maintain the machines , tho records of the city controller show that the Election Board has paid several thousand dollars to A.V.M. in the last few years for repairs . And the Jacobs report on the county Election Department minimized the manpower needed to maintain and repair the machines between elections . " . .. the problem of staffing the unit , " the report states , " is not in providing for the stripping and clearing of the machines for elections that occur so infrequently . The problem is in having on hand manpower that is capable of preparing the machine for elections . . " The report concluded that five extra men should be trained to help the nine fulltime workers and supervisors prepare the machines before the elections and work in the central office between the elections . Predicts a " Disaster " DeCarl told The Tribune , as did county election officials last winter , that election day would be a disaster in some polling places if he did not have trainel men available for emergency repairs . The Jacobs report pointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the March 21 election with a reduced staff , and recommended that the county train 15 men in the central election division office to do repair work on election days . The machines of the city Election Board presently are the subject of a federal inquiry into possible kickbacks involving their original purchase .
