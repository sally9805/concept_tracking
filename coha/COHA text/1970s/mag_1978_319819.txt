It has taken a long time , but at last Jimmy Carter is doing a lot of talking with businessmen . Though he created a million-dollar agribusiness , he is a rural populist , and so he has been suspicious of big interests , including corporations . In just the past several months , however , the President has come to believe that many business chiefs are much like himself-up from the bottom , and not without compassion-and that they may have some provocative ideas about his No , 1 domestic problem : the economy . <P> So the President holds many unpublicized conversations with such fellows as Du Pont 's Irving Shapiro , General Motors ' Thomas Murphy and A T &T's; John deButts . Very often , he seeks the advice of a tall , spare British immigrant who is emerging as one of the three or four most influential spokesmen of American business , General Electric Chairman Reginald Jones . <P> Everybody , including the President , calls him Reg , ( At General Electric they say the name is pronounced with a hard g @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as in Jesus . ) In those private phone calls and White House meetings with Jimmy Carter , Reg Jones unfurls his ideas about taxation , inflation and creating jobs in America . <P> The U.S. certainly has an unemployment problem , says Jones , but it is very narrow , specific and limited . Although companies can not find the skilled workers they need , there are not nearly enough jobs for the untrained people , particularly young blacks and Hispanics . The problem is only transitory , though , says Jones . Because of the baby boom two decades ago , the 16-to-19 age group now makes up 10% of the U.S. population . <P> By the mid-1980s , this job-seeking cohort will be down to 7.5% , and unemployment will be much less severe . Therefore , Jones argues , " we should n't put in place a number of permanent job-creating programs . " <P> What we should do , he says , is enact ambitious but limited ones . Jones asks fellow businessmen to support the CETA ( for Comprehensive Employment and Training Act ) programs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young . He applauds Carter 's call for $400 million in the ' 79 budget to expand that work . <P> During World War II , the Government spurred construction of defense plants by offering " certificates of necessity , " which allowed companies to deduct the costs from their taxes in only five years . Now , says Jones , the Government should permit fast write-offs for the plants that companies build in pockets of youth and minority unemployment . <P> Jones says that one of his favorite salesmen is AFL-CIO President George Meany , and the old plumber has allied with the GE boss on many issues . Once when Jones congratulated Meany for selling an increase in the investment tax credit on Capitol Hill , Meany said : " Hell , the trouble with you business guys is that you talk about ' capital formation . ' What you should be talking about is ' job formation ' because those are buzz words to Congressmen . " <P> In his talks with Carter , Jones uses the right buzz words . If businessmen are going to risk money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earn better than the current 4% real return on investment , which is way down from the almost 10% of the mid-1960s .
