Possibly the breath of life is no longer sweet to you . You may enjoy collecting black eyes , contu  --  sions and abrasions . Or perhaps consider the riding of a rail while decked out in tar and feathers a healthful form of exercise . Then and only then - the author eschews any responsibility for your personal safety if you care to put the matter to a test  --  may you breathe the merest whisper against the quarter horse , and then preferably in the pri  --  vacy of your cell in a monastery devoted to silence and solitude . For out there waiting are multitudes of cowpokes , rodeo riders , racing aficionados , some 73,000 flinty-eyed members of the Ameri  --  can Quarter Horse Association , and millions of just plain horse lovers who will fight you at the drop of a sombrero over the merest suggestion that this breed is anything but the noblest which ever streaked on four legs . What is more , they could be right . 1 speak with the authority of a man who as a very little tot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the fast  --  est and circled the race on the outside rim nearest to the reached-for gold ring . I have all my life been Photo by Harold Campton a listener to that most vociferous species of our two-legged race  --  the horse lovers . I have survived endless dinner parties of otherwise sane people who will argue for hours , disregarding the cham  --  pagne and the duck bigarade , to vilify each other over the probabilities of the paint horse being a descendant of one of those Cortez brought to this country ( the Spaniards have always had a yen for well-marked horses ) or merely a wanderer from the outer reaches of China in the misted time when the Bering Strait was a land bridge between this continent and Asia . I have been knocked down and nearly killed by a horse trained for the cavalry who objected to the roots of his enormous yellow fangs at being used for propulsion on a skijoring exhibi  --  tion . I have been nearly beheaded , like an Ichabod Crane , that headless horseman of Tarrytown. by another beast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indignity of such an un  --  gainly rider , until he reached a covered bridge  --  whereupon he broke into a gallop , intermixed with broncho-busting jumps , in an effort to pin my cranium forever as a ghoulish trophy on the wood  --  en beams of the roof . I was once almost defaced by the great racehorse Kelso , whose $2 million win  --  nings on the track , aided by a temper which made them geld him long before he took to racing , probably gave him the right to dislike my nose and attempt to remove it . In spite of all this , I love horses . I rejoice at the thought that there are more horses in America today , an estimated seven million , than there were before the advent of the automobile . I rejoice that Detroit , the pinnacle of our industrial age , mea  --  sures its great metal beasts according to the horse  --  power they can generate . And that NASA , the eye of our space exploration , boasts that our newest and greatest aerospace achievement , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will link up with the Russian Soy uz in outer space this summer , has the incredible thrust of twenty-four million horses ! The simple answer is that the horse which has served man for centuries as his battle charger , as the muscles of the plow , as transportation , and all too often as food , has now graduated into a nobler existence based upon the glory of an animal racing to best his kind ( the ancient instinct of horse flesh is for the strongest and fleetest animal to run at the head of the herd as its leader and protector ) , to provide his mettle and breeding in the horse show , and to be a friend to man . The American quarter horse does all this  --  and besides , he plays a role in the cattle country in roping and cutting work which nothing else in the world  --  either metal or flesh and blood  --  can perform quite as intelligent  --  ly , powerfully , or usefully . Let 's quickly ( and breathlessly , like a quarter horse owner who can never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one sentence ) sketch this fascinating quarter horse and what he does . I rely on my friend , the late Walter Osborne , author of so many fine books on the horse , and nonpareil photographer of great equus , to portray the quarter horse in suitable terms : " Physically , the good quarter horse is one of the most pleasing of horses to look upon . His well-shaped , ' breedy ' head , with its small dainty ears , wide-set eyes , and neatly squared-off muzzle , reflects his strong eastern background . His full neck is lightly arched at the crest and is in good proportion to the rest of his body . The shoulder slopes sharply ; the chest is unusually deep and broad . " The quarter horse 's forelegs are characterized by quite short cannon bones and medium-length pasterns . His short-coupled back , commencing in medium-high but quite sharp withers which run well back , is well formed to accept the saddle . Perhaps his most distinguishing characteristic is the exceptionally powerful musculature of his hindquarters , which rise through the loin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives the illusion of being taller at the rump end than he is at the withers . Then he slopes off to a well-set tail . His bones appear flat and are clean but show much more substance than those of his more fragile cousins on the thoroughbred side of his family . " His truly remarkable balance , both when standing still and when in motion , accounts for his fantastic ability to dart off in any direction , spin around and stop on a dime , without losing a jot of his poise . His extreme alertness , coupled with his unusually placid temperament , is responsible for that oft-quoted description of the quarter horse as a ' sleepy little critter that can unwind like light  --  nin ' . ' Not only can he do that , hut , owing to generations of toughening on the arid western prairies , he can do it time after time without working up the smallest streak of sweat , when virtually any other horse would be lathered from head to tail . " In an article written for the American Quarter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ berg , master of the famed King Ranch at Kings  --  ville . Texas , and a leading breeder of quarter horses and thoroughbreds , stated ; ' If the range livestock men of America were asked to select the horse that is most useful for their purpose and that has con  --  tributed the most pleasure and satisfaction to their lives , I believe they would select the quarter horse , or the cross of the quarter horse on the thorough  --  bred that has retained the quarter horse conforma  --  tion . If asked to give their reasons for this choice they would say , " Our horses have to live on the range and rely on the native shrubs and grasses for their food . The quarter horse takes on and carries enough flesh and muscle to stand the hard work that is required of him . He has a good , quiet disposition , is easy to gentle and train , has extreme early speed and the strength and surefootedness to carry heavy weight over any kind of country . He stops and turns easily and does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start quickly many times in the course of the day 's roping , cutting or other work . " ' " This handsome animal is ( I risk my life to make the statement ) not as well known to Americans , particularly city dwellers , as the thoroughbred . And yet his background could be considered even more romantic and a matter of our national pride . All horses , of course , are descended from the shy little " dawn horse , " Eohippus , only the size of a terrier dog , who still had the wit and speed to // emerge on this planet almost sixty million years before man himself , and survive in spite of it all . The quarter horse was the first breed of horses developed in the Americas . originating during the colonial era , in the Carolinas and Virginia . There , more than 300 years ago . match racing was the leading outdoor sport , with races run on village streets and along country lanes near the planta  --  tions . Seldom were these horses raced beyond 440 yards , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The foundation of these quarter running horses came from the Arab , Barb , and Turk breeds brought to North America by Spanish explorers and traders . Stallions selected from these first ar  --  rivals were crossed with a hand of mares which arrived from England in 1611 . The cross produced compact . heavily muscled horses which could run a short distance faster than those of any other breed . The uses of the quarter horse were manifold . As the white man moved west he took the quarter horse with him to help conquer and settle the continent . This is the horse that pulled the plows , wagons and buggies of the pioneers ; went up the trail with cattle to pasture and market ; carried preachers and their Bibles to furthermost points of worship , and sped country doctors to the beds of injured and ailing frontiersmen . The quarter horse survived time and change because he excelled in qualities which were of major importance to the greatest number of persons in diverse occupations and geographical areas . He was early adopted by ranchers and cowboys as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for he possesses inherent " cow-sense . " The quarter horse became established in the Southwest in the early part of the nineteenth century . As he trailed cattle north and west , he left his progeny along the way , though his greatest influence remained in the Southwest until after his registry was established in 1941 by the American Quarter Horse Association . In the years after the registry was created , the breed spread rapidly throughout the nation , into Canada , Old Mexico and numerous nations over  --  seas . His registry now is growing more than three times as fast as any other horse breed registry in the world , with over one million horses registered to date . A true hot blood , the quarter horse breeds true when given the chance . In type he is unlike any other breed . In performance and endurance he has never been excelled , and in bloodlines , he has been sufficiently prepotent to withstand outcrossing and hold his own for more than three hundred years ? the most versatile horse the world has ever known . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular horse " is featured in more than 3,000 annual quar  --  ter horse shows in the U.S. and Canada for youth and adult exhibitors . The extraordinary abilities of the quarter horse may be gathered from the com  --  petitive events at such shows . I got ta say it : just try and put any other breed of horse up against the likes of this for cutting , reining , roping , barrel racing , English and western pleasure , western rid  --  ing , rodeoing , working cowhorse , steer roping. pole bending , trail horse , jumping , working hunt  --  er , polo . halter and chariot racing . For pure , blinding speed , the quarter horse can outrun any other breed at his own distance , the 440 . It is not a question of stamina . The thorough  --  bred , which can run for two miles without slacking off , has no more stamina because of this . As Walter Osborne has observed , " When it comes to working all day under a blazing sun , or in the teeth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big stock saddle , the ' stamina ' of even the most ordi  --  nary quarter horse is such that he would outlast by hours the gamest thoroughbred ever foaled . " Walter said it . But he also gives the physiologi  --  cal reasons for it : " When the quarter horse jumps out for a start , propelled by his unusually powerful hindquarter muscles , his strong forelegs literally grab at the ground . Compared with the free-strid  --  ing thoroughbred , he seems almost to scramble down the straightaway . The horizontal plane through which he travels is more parallel to the ground than that of the thoroughbred , and his shorter , quicker stride can he compared with the action of an automobile in low gear . " The thoroughbred , whose muscles are , by comparison , longer and flatter , can not gather him  --  self so rapidly at the outset , but like a car in high gear he runs effortlessly once he is rolling . He secures considerably less advantage from his long  --  er , slimmer forelegs , and virtually his entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know as his ' drive shaft , ' the exceptional length between his point of hip and point of hock . He runs through a horizontal plane which tilts upward at the forward end with the result that , as he gathers momentum , he becomes slightly ' air  --  borne . ' ? " Often too , the average thoroughbred , though he may be taller and rangier than the typical quar  --  ter horse , is lighter in weight . The simple fact that he is toting less weight on his frame is another factor that partly explains his greater staying power . " But let 's look at what comes of all this . It 's only since 1940 that the quarter horse really has taken over the Sport of Kings . Horse racing itself is the greatest spectator sport in America , with almost twice the magnitude of its competitors  --  auto rac  --  ing , football , basketball , and the rest . As for money , which is , after all , what makes the hossies run , Kelso and Secretariat never had it so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Continued on page 108 // continued from page 100 the lack of " action " as a flaw in an otherwise well-conceived show . And in an age when the automobile " chase " scene is nearly a television staple , such criticism should be no surprise . " Sure , we 've thought about in  --  troducing elements of a more sensa  --  tional nature , " producer Hawkins said . " One time we considered an episode wherein the black hats rode into town . We tried and we tried and we tried , but dammit the black hats do n't work . They just do n't work . When they come in , the show goes out the window . " What keeps the show going is week after week of problems and circumstances which are faced by people in the ordinary course of their lives . Problems like the neces  --  sity of a father 's leaving home for a short period to earn money in another city . Problems of eco  --  nomics , of family relationships , of growing up . For instance , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a neighbor from the Ingallses ' previous home in Kan  --  sas . Another , on young Laura 's first dose of puppy love . And yet an  --  other , on the anxiety of bringing an inappropriate gift to a neighbor  --  hood birthday party . No sensation  --  alism here , just real situations of importance to the participants . Obviously , the characterizations of these participants must be good for such a series to work . And the performance by the regular cast has been superb . " They 're great and they 're getting even better , " pro  --  ducer Hawkins said . " And with all the attention Mike commands , they 'd better stay great . " Karen Grassle plays the role of Charles Ingalls 's wife Caroline , the quintes  --  sential pioneer woman . The eldest Ingalls daughter is played by Melis  --  sa Sue Anderson ( Mary ) ; Laura is played by Melissa Gilbert ; and the youngest ( Carrie ) is played alter  --  nately by identical twins Lindsay and Sidney Greenbush . " We know that many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child closest to their own age , " Ward Hawkins points out . " And this just gives us all the more responsibility to pro  --  duce a tasteful show . " " Little House on the Prairie " is a breath of fresh air to actor and part-time director Victor French , who plays Mr. Edwards in the se  --  ries . A talented actor for twenty years , French is a big , bearded man with a deep voice and deeper eyes . " Throughout my career , I 've been the heavy , the black hat , the bad guy , " he said . " Why , I 've been beaten , robbed , killed ; and have beaten , robbed and killed on so many shows I 'd rather not think about it . " French was a regular on both " Bonanza " and " Gunsmoke " for years as  --  you guessed it  --  the heavy . " Now , as Mr. Edwards , I 'm able to be the type of character thatmeans something , " he said , deep eyes gleaming . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's really old Victor French out there being Victor French . I 've never felt this good about doing a show in my life . No doubt , there is something special out there . It 's like a labor of love . That 's it  --  a la  --  bor of love . " You look around again . Every  --  one still seems to be smiling . The sun has set hours ago . De  --  spite Penn 's efforts , the filming has gone beyond seven p.m . The last se  --  quence features Karen Grassle and a guest star in an indoor setting . Young Melissa Sue Anderson , long completed with her scenes , lingers to watch the final shooting . The scene is worked flawlessly . You feel as if you 're witnessing a scene from a century ago ; as if you 've been transported through some time machine back into the lives of peo  --  ple now long dead . You see and you believe . And you know why the show is received so well . Miss Grassle walks smartly from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ briefly . She ca n't stay long . She has a plane to catch . She 's appearing in a charity tele  --  thon the next day in Memphis . You see and you believe . You return to the producer 's office and are shown a mountain of mail upon Landon 's desk . " That 's this week 's mail , " a woman says in a quiet voice . " We probably get thousands of letters , thousands each week . I 've never seen a show get so much mail . " One letter begins : " Dear Mr. Landon : I have never before been so moved to write to any television personality or network as I have since ' The Little House ' has been introduced . . " Another contains a paragraph : " My daughter has read every one of the books at least a dozen times and literally ' lives through ' each one of your episodes . However , it is not only she , but our entire family who tries not to miss one of the programs . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The letters go on like that . Nearly all of them . " Little House " has combined any number of elements to become one of America 's most successful and best loved television series . It will return next year " with the chil  --  dren a year older , the community a little larger , and with a few new characters added , " according to producer Hawkins . The success of the show has surprised everyone : critics , the network , the cast , even Landon . Which brings to mind the closing line of dialogue from an early show in the series , spoken by Laura : " Pa said he was glad we 'd come to live on the banks of Plum Creek , because here he 'd harvested a crop he did n't know he 'd planted ... a harvest of friends . " The same has happened for all of us.
