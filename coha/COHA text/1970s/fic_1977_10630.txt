IRWIN SHAWsatiny , firm leg thrown across him , a soft , exploring hand on his belly , a mouth against his ear , murmuring words he could not understand . He did not know what time it was when , all nerves quiescent , his body glowingly at rest , he finally lay still , his fingertips just touching the now familiar body that had given him so much pleasure . Fragrant , accidentalhumanity lying in the bed beside him . All praise to the animal hidden in the black suit . Disregarded , gloriously disregarded the deprivedPuritan .

The woman rose , too , strong , supple body , breasts full , haunches muscled , and covered herself in a gown , sat in a chair watching him with a little smile as he put on his clothes . He wished she had n't put on the light , had not wakened . Then he could have left a hundred francs , maybe a thousand francs , on the mantelpiece , darkness and sleep concealing his provincial American ignoranceof such matters ; he could have slipped out of the apartment and out of the house , all connections broken . But the light was on , the woman was watching him , smiling . Waiting ? There was no avoiding the moment . He took out his wallet . " Is a thousand francs enough ? " he asked , stumbling a little over the " enough . " She looked at him curiously , the smile vanishing . Then she began to laugh .

He watched her , feeling his nerves twitching , regretting that he had been in her bed , that he had offered her a drink , that he was in Nice , regretting that he had ever set foot in France . " I 'm sorry , " he said inanely . " It 's just that I 'm not accustomed . . . " She raised her head , her face still distorted by laughter . She stood up and came over to him and kissed his cheek . " Poor dear , " she said , the laughter still there , at the back of her throat . " I did n't know I was worth that much . " " If you want more . . . " he said stiffly . " Much more , " she said .

You 're too modest , my charming American , too modest by half . " " Well , " he said , " it never happened to me before . " He was afraid she was going to start laughing again . She shook her head wonderingly . " What 's wrong with American women ? " she said . She moved over to the bed and sat on the edge . She patted it . " Come , sit down , please , " she said .

" Not a drinking man . Just the sort of man I needed tonight . Let me tell you a little about myself . I 'm married . To a major in the army . He was an aide to the militaryattache in Washington . " That 's where the English came from , he thought , no lobbyists , no congressmen , no motels . " Now he is stationed temporarily in Paris . At the Ecole Militaire , " she said . " Temporarily .

They must be preparing a terrible war at the Ecole Militaire when a poor little major ca n't get off for even one day to fly to Nice to see his wife once in three months . I have a very good idea of what kind of war my major is preparing in Paris . You heard me on the telephone . . . ? " " Yes , " Rudolph said . " I could n't hear what you were saying . . .

" It added just the right note of comedy to the evening . When you came in and sat down , with your decent , bony , respectable American face , I decided not to go home . " She smiled .

" I guess I was ashamed of what I was doing . " He smiled . " What I thought I was doing . Maybe I half believed if it was n't my own name it was n't me who was really doing it . More likely , if we ever met and I was with somebody else and you said hello , Jimmy , I could say , I 'm sorry , madam , you must be thinking of somebody else .

But when you 're a boy in his teens , your head full of books , with heroes with names like Huckleberry Finn , Daniel Boone , Studs Lonigan . . . Well , it seemed to me that Rudolph sounded like . . . like heavy German cooking . Especially during the war . " He had never told anyone how he felt about his Christian name , had never formulated it clearly for himself even , and now found that it was with a sense of relief , mixed with wry amusement , that he could speak about itopenly to this handsome stranger , or almost stranger .

" From now on I will call you Rodolfo . " " Rodolfo Jordache , " he said . It gave him a new , more dashing view of himself . " Jordache . That 's my family name . I 'm at the Hotel du Cap . " All defenses down now . Names and addresses . Each at the other 's mercy . " One more thing . I 'm married . " " I expected as much , " Jeanne said . " Your affair .

" She got up and went over to a little desk where there was a pen and some paper and wrote down her telephone number .

" Other times . . . . " Now , " she said , " I 'll call you a taxi . " They went into the salon and she dialed a number , spoke quickly for a moment , waited a little while , said , " Tres bien , " hung up . " The taxi will be here in five minutes , " she said . Before she opened the front door for him they kissed , a long , grateful , healing kiss . " Good night , Rodolfo , " she said . She smiled , a smile he knew he would remember for a long time . The taxi was waiting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dieselmotor making it sound like a launch waiting to put out to sea . Voyages . " L'hotel Negresco , " Rudolph said as he got in . When the taxi started , he looked back at the house . It was imperative for him to be able to find it again , to recognize it in his dreams . When they got to the Negresco he made sure he was not run down as he crossed to where his car was44 IRWIN SHAW Beggarman , Thief 45parked . Then , at the wheel of his rented car , he drove slowly and very carefully on the deserted road along the sea to Antibes . When he reached the port he slowed down even more , then abruptly swung the car into the parking lot and got out and walked along the quay to where the Clothilde was berthed in the silent harbor . There were no lights to be seen on the Clothilde . He did n't want to wake Wesley or Bunny . He took off his shoes and climbed down from the deck into the dory lying alongside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oars through the locks . He rowed almost soundlessly away from the ship toward the middle of the harbor , then , pulling more strongly , toward the harbor entrance , the tarry smell of the water strong in his nostrils , mixed with the flowery fragrance from shore . He had acted almost automatically , not asking himself why he was doing this . The pull of the oars against his shoulders and arms gave him a sober pleasure , and the sigh of the small bow wave against the sides of the dory seemed a fitting music with which to end the night . The city of Antibes , looming shadows , with a light here and there , receded slowly as he headed toward the red and green lights that marked the channel into the sea . The rhythm of his body as he bent forward , then leaned back , satisfied him . How many times had these same oars moved in the hands of his brother . His own hands were soft against the smooth wood , polished by the strong hands of his brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be blistered pleased him . Being alone on the dark surface of the water was a benediction to him and the blinking lights of the harbor entrance comforted him , with their promise of safe anchorages . Grief was possible here , but also hope . " Thomas , Thomas , " he said softly as he went out into the sea and felt its gentle swell lift the dory . He remembered , as he rowed , all the times they had failed each other , and the end , when they had forgotten the failures or at least forgiven them . He felt tireless and serene , alone in the dark night , but then he heard the coughing of a small fishing boat putting out to sea behind him , one small acetylene lamp at its bow . The fishing boat passed near him and he could see two men in it staring curiously at him . He was conscious of how strange it must look to them , a man in a dark business suit , alone , headed out to sea at that hour . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then let the oars dangle and stared up at the starlit sky . He thought of his father , that enraged and pitiful old man , who hadalso rowed in darkness , who had picked a night of storm for his last voyage . Suicide had been possible for his father , who had found the peace in death he had never achieved in life . It was not possible for him . He was a different man , with different claims upon him . He took one long , deep breath , then turned the dory around and rowed back to the Clothilde , his hands burning . Quietly , he tied up to the Clothilde 's stern , climbed the ladder and went ashore . He put on his shoes , a rite observed , a ceremony celebrated , and got into his car and started the engine . It was past three in the morning when he got to the hotel . The lobby was deserted , the night concierge yawning behind the desk . He asked for his key and was turning toward the elevator when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jordache . Mrs. Burke left a message for you . You are to call her whenever you get in . She said it was urgent . " " Thank you , " Rudolph said wearily . Whatever it was , Gretchen would have to wait until morning . " Mrs. Burke told me to call her when you got in . No matter what time . " She had guessed he would try to avoid her , had taken steps to make sure he could n't . " I see , " said Rudolph . He sighed . " Call her , please . Tell her I 'll come to her room as soon as I look in on my wife . " He should have stayed the night in Nice . Or rowed till dawn . Faced everything in daylight . " One more thing , " said the concierge . " There was a gentleman here asking for you . A Mr. Hubbell . He said he was from Time Magazine . He used the telex . " " If he comes here and asks for me again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand . Bonne nuit , monsieur . " Rudolph rang for the elevator . He had planned to telephone Jeanne , say good night to her , try to tell her what she had done for him , listen to the husky voice , with its rough , sensual shading , fall off to sleep with the memory of the night to take the weight from his dreams . He could forgetthat now . He shuffled into the elevator , feeling old , got off at his floor , opened the door to the suite as silently as he could . The lights were on , both in the salon and in the bedroom in which Jean slept . Since the murder she refused to sleep in the dark . As he approached her doorway she called out , " Rudolph ? " " Yes , dear . " He sighed . He had hoped she was asleep . He went into her room . She was sitting up in bed , staring at him . Automatically he looked for a glass or a bottle . There was no glass or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't been drinking . She looks old , he thought , old . The drawn face , the dull eyes over the lacy nightgown made her look like a malicious sketch of the woman she would be forty years from now . " What time is it ? " she asked harshly . " After three . You 'd better go to sleep . " " After three . The consulate in Nice keeps odd hours , does n't it ? " " I took the night off , " he said . " From what ? " " From everything , " he said . " From me , " she said bitterly . " That 's become quite a habit , has n't it ? A way of life with you , would n't you say ? " " Let 's discuss it in the morning , shall we ? " he said . She sniffed . " You stink of perfume , " she said . " Shall we discuss that in the morning , too ? " " If you wish , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . " Leave the door open , " she called . " I have to keep all avenues of escape open . " He left the door open . He wished he could pity her . He went into his bedroom through the salon , closing his own door behind him . Then he unlocked the door that led from his room into the corridor and went out . He did n't want to have to explain to Jean that he had to see Gretchen about something that his sister thought was urgent . Gretchen 's room was down the corridor . He went past the pairs of shoes left out by the guests to be shined while they slept . Europe was on the brink of Communism , he thought , but shoes were still shined by future commissars , budding Trotskies , between midnight and six each morning . He knocked on Gretchen 's door . She opened it immediately , as though she had been standing there , alerted by the concierge 's call , as though she could n't bear to wait the extra second or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and confront her brother . She was in a terry cloth bathrobe , light blue , the blue almost identical with the blue of the dress Jeanne had been wearing in the cafe . With her small pale face , dark hair and strong , graceful body , she bore a striking resemblance to Jeanne , he thought . Echoes everywhere . The idea had n't occurred to him before . " Come in , " she said . " I 've been so worried . God , where 've you been ? " " It 's a long story , " he said . " Ca n't it wait till morning ? " Beggarman , Thief 47 " It ca n't wait until morning , " she said , closing the door . She sniffed . " You smell heavenly , Brother , " she said sarcastically . " And you look as though you 've just been laid . " " I 'm a gentleman , " Rudolph said , trying to make light of the accusation . " Gentlemen do n't discuss matters like that . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vulgar side , Gretchen . " Let 's drop it , please , " he said . " I need some sleep . What 's so damned urgent ? " Gretchen fell back into a big armchair , sprawling , as though she were too tired to stand anymore . " Bunny Dwyer called an hour ago , " she said flatly . " Wesley 's in jail . " " What ? " " Wesley 's in jail in Cannes . He got into a fight in a bar and nearly killed a man with a beer bottle . He hit a cop and the police had to subduehim . Is that urgent enough for you , Brother ?

The taxi , Rudolph had decided , was a wiser choice than his own car . He did n't want to go charging into a French police station to demand his nephew 's freedom , only to be forced to take a breathalator test . Even in his heavy , dark blue seaman 's sweater , Dwyer was shivering as he leaned against the wall and his face was pale , greenish , in the watery light from the prefecture 's lamps . Rudolph looked at his watch as he got out of the taxi . Past 4:00 A.M. The streets of Cannes were deserted , all errands but his completed for the night or postponed until morning .

French police , " he said bitterly . " You might as well talk to Hitler . " " How is he ? " Rudolph asked . Looking at Dwyer , hunched against the cold night air , he felt small shivers run down his spine , too . He was dressed for the day 's warmth , had neglected to grab a coat at the hotel . " I do n't know how he is now , " Dwyer said . " He was n't too bad when they dragged him in .

" All right , Bunny , " he said soothingly . " I 'm here . I 'll see what I can do . But you have to fill me in . What happened ? " " I took him out to dinner in Antibes , " Bunny said . He said it defensively , as though Rudolph was accusing him , as though his innocence had to be claimed and confirmed before anything else was said or done . " I could n't leave the kid alone on a night like this , could I ? " " Of course not . " " We drank some wine . Wesley drank wine with all of us , in front of his father , his father would pour it out of the bottle for him as though he was a grown-up , you forget that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in France . . . " His voice trailed off , as though the shared bottle of wine between the boy and himself in the restaurant in Antibes was another unjust charge against him . " I know , " Rudolph said , trying not to sound impatient . " Then what ? " " Then the kid wanted a brandy . Two brandies . I thought , why not ? After all , the day you bury your father . . . Even if he got drunk , we were right near the port , I could get him back to the ship with no trouble . Only he would n't go back to the ship . All of a sudden he got up from the table and he said , I 'm going to Cannes . " What the hell do you want to go to Cannes for , this time of night ? ' I said . I 'm going to visit a nightclub , ' he said . His exact words . Visit . I 'm going to visit the Porte Rose . ' God knows what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that kid 's head . I tried to reason with him , I swear to God I did . Fuck you , Bunny , ' he said . He never swore at me before . He had a funny dead look on his face . You could n't budge him with a bulldozer . Nobody 's asking you to come with me , ' he said . Go get your beauty sleep . ' He was half out of the restaurant before I could get to him , grab his arm , at least . I could n't let him go to that goddamn place alone , could I ? " " No , " Rudolph said wearily . " You did the right thing . " He wondered if he would have done better or worse in Dwyer 's place . Worse , he thought . " So we got a taxi and we went to the Porte Rose , " Dwyer rattled on , made garrulous by grief or fear or impotence . " He never said a word in the taxi . Not word one . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tourist . Who the hell knew what he had in his mind ? I 'm not a psychologist , I never had kids , who knows what crazy things they think of ? " The tone of innocence , not expecting the innocence to be believed or recognized was in the voice again . " So , " Dwyer went on , " I thought , Okay , he 's disturbed . Who is n't today , a day like this one , he has some crazy notion maybe that he owes it to his old man to go and see the place where it all began . He saw the end , with the ashes floating out to sea , maybe he had to see the beginning , too . " The beginning , Rudolph thought , thinking of the ferocious brother he had slept with in the same bed over the bakery store , the beginning was not in a nightclub in Cannes . You 'd have to go back further than that . A lot further . " Maybe even it was a good idea , I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing , the Yugoslav Tom had the fight with was n't going to be there  --  the police 've been hunting for him ever since they talked to him the day after the murder and they ai n't found any trace of him yet .

It would n't be a pleasant experience for me , but what 's the harm , a couple of drinks and then home to bed and a hangovertomorrow and that 's it ? " " I understand , Bunny , " Rudolph said , shivering . " You could n't do anything else , given the circumstances . " Dwyer nodded vigorously . " Given the circumstances , " he said . " How did the fight start ? " Rudolph asked . Dwyer 's excuses for himselfcould wait until another day . It was four in the morning and he was cold and Wesley was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him over . " Was it Wesley 's fault ? " " Fault ? Who ever knows whose fault it is when something like that happens ? " Dwyer 's mouth quivered . " We were standing at the bar , not saying anything to each other , maybe after two , maybe three whiskeys , we were on Scotch now , Wesley wanted Scotch  --  he did n't seem drunk  --  that kid must have a head like iron  --  and there was a big Englishman next to him , and he was drinking beer and talking loud . He was off some ship in the harbor , you could tell he was a seaman , he was saying something about Americans in English to the girl , I guess it was n't very complimentarybecause all of a sudden Wesley turned to him and said , quiet-like , Shut your big trap about Americans , limey .

' But the Englishman , Christ , he must 've weighed two hundred pounds , thirty , thirty-two years old , drinking all that beer , he said , Would you repeat that , please , sonny ? ' So , nice and calm , Wesley said , Shut your big trap about Americans , limey . ' " Even then , it could 've been avoided , because the girl kept tugging at the Englishman 's sleeve and saying , ' Let 's go home , Arnold .

' I do n't believe the Clothilde is going to be a popular ship from now on . ' It was the laugh that got Wesley , I think . He reached out sudden and grabbed the beer bottle first and cracked it across the man 's face . The Englishman went down , blood all over him and everybodyscreaming all around and Wesley started stomping him , with the craziest expression you ever saw on a boy 's face . Where he ever learned to fight like that nobody 'll ever know . Stomping , for Christ 's sake . And laughing , crazy as a bedbug , with me hanging on him to pull him back and making no more impression on him than if I was a mosquito buzzingaround his neck . " It did n't take long .

He was still conscious , too , of the musky fragrance of perfume that still clung to him . You are not dressed or properly deodorized for the occasion , he told himself as he went toward the high desk behind which sat a fat policemanwith blue jaws , scowling at him . Travel , he thought , as he smiled , or hoped he smiled , at the policeman , travel broadens one 's horizons ; one visits cathedrals , the beds of the wives of continental military men , one sails over the hulks of ships sunk in many wars , one becomes familiar with foreign customs , strange foods , police stations , crematories . . .

" I am not good in French . " " Come back at eight o'clock in the morning , " the policeman said slowly enough so that Rudolph could understand him . " I would like to see him now , " Rudolph said . " You heard what I said . " The policeman spoke with exaggerated slowness and held up his two hands , with eight fingers extended . Rudolph decided that the policeman had not heard of Lafayette or D day . " He may need medical attention , " he said .

" I 'd like to talk to your superior officer , " he said stubbornly . " He is not here at the present time . " " Somebody . " " I am somebody . " Again the policeman laughed . Then he scowled . The scowl was more natural to him than laughter . " You are invited to leave , monsieur , " he said harshly . " This room must be kept clear . " 54 IRWIN SHAWFor a moment , Rudolph thought of offering a bribe . But he had made the mistake once that night of offering money in the wrong place . Here it would be considerably more dangerous . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policeman waved a thick hand impatiently . " I have work to do . " Beaten , Rudolph left the room . Dwyer was still hitting the knuckles of one hand against the palm of his other hand outside . " Well ? " Dwyer asked . " Nothing doing , " Rudolph said flatly . " Not until eight o'clock in the morning . We might as well go to a hotel here . There 's no sense in going back to Antibes for just a couple of hours . " " I do n't like to leave the Clothilde alone , " Dwyer said . " There 's no telling , what with the way things are . . . " He left the thought unfinished . " I 'll be hack in the morning . " " Whatever you say , " Rudolph said . He felt as though he had run for hours . In the morning , early , he would call the lawyer in Antibes . He remembered old Teddy Boylan , whose family owned the brickworks in Port Philip , where Rudolph was born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the word , and had , in a way , educated him . Teddy Boylan , who had advised him to go to law school . " Lawyers run the world , " Boylan had said . Good advice perhaps for men who wanted to run the world . He had once been one of them . No longer was . If he had taken the advice , been admitted to the bar , would the blue-jowled policeman inside have laughed at him and kicked him out ? Would Wesley be behind bars now , at the mercy of a cop he had knocked down in a brawl ? Would Tom be alive or at least have had a neater death ? **34;4616;TOOLONG . He trudged through the empty streets , cleared now of whores and gamblers and ambulances , toward the Hotel Carlton , where he could get a room for a few hours ' sleep and Dwyer could find a taxi to take him back to the Clothilde . This is the way my father must have felt a hundred times in his life , beat up and aching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he lay on the bare board that pulled down from the wall of the cell into which he had been thrown . The thought somehow comforted him , made him feel closer to his father , as the prayer the afternoon before had not . He felt quiet now , relaxed , not caring about anything , at least not justBeggarman , Thief 55yet . He was glad they 'd pulled him off the Englishman and he hoped he had n't killed the son of a bitch . If the son of a bitch did n't die , his Uncle Rudy would get him off . Littleold Mr. Fixit , Rudy Jordache . He had to smile , even though it hurt to smile , when he thought this . The smile did n't last long . He had n't known his father long enough . He did n't know how long was enough , but he knew that the time he 'd had was n't it . There would n't be any more of those long conversations in the darkened wheelhouse . Makeup time , his father used to call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the years when his mother had run away with him , had shuffled him off to one miserable school after another , telling him his father had deserted him , had run off with a cheap tart , was probably dead , the life he led , drinking , whoring , gambling , fighting , throwing his money away , everybody 's enemy . His mother had a lot to answer for . For that matter , he had a lot to answer for himself . If he had been a little more alert , had seen or sensed the sunken log they 'd hit , and they had n't had to come back to Antibes for repairs , they 'd all be along the coast of Italy now , Portofino , Elba , Sicily , his father talking in that low , rough voice with everybody sleeping below , telling him about Clothilde Deveraux , the woman the boat was named for , the servant in Tom 's fat , German Uncle Harold 's house , scrubbing him down naked in the bathtub , feeding him gigantic meals , making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father had said sadly , there for a while and then gone . Or if he had n't been sleeping like a baby , he 'd have heard the footsteps on the deck , the way his father always did , no matter how tired he was or how deep in sleep , and come up to see his father on the way to rescue Jean Jordache , alone . He could have gone with him , maybe had the sense to make him call the police , at least be with him so that the Yugoslav would have realized there was no sense in fighting . Who 'm I kidding ? Wesley thought . One night it would have happened in Portofino or Elba or Sicily . There was no stopping Jean Jordache from getting into trouble and dragging everybody along with her . He had n't liked her from the beginning and he 'd told his father so . His fatherhad said , " I admit she has her problems . I wouldn't 've married her , but Rudy is a different kind of man . She 's rich , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had shrugged . " Maybe you got to pay for rich , pretty and smart . " Only it was his father who 'd paid . Too brave for his own good , too sure of himself . " I 've had plenty of woman troubles myself . " He 'd smiled a little sadly in the dark as he 'd said that , and told his son56 IRWIN SHAWabout the twins they said he 'd knocked up in Elysium , Ohio , when they jailed him on the charge of statutory rape . " Looking back , " Tom had said philosophically , " maybe it was worth it , though I did n't think so at the time . I suppose I could tell you to be careful , but I do n't suppose it 'd do any good , would it , Wesley ? " " I 'm half careful , " Wesley had said . He 'd screwed two married ladies on two different voyages , taking chances , with their husbands on board , and he knew his father knew about it . " I noticed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " About like average , I guess , " Wesley said . " I would n't know . " " I did , too , " Tom said . " There was a wild English girl by the name of . . . let me see if I can remember her name . . . Betty , Betty Something  --  BettyJohns  --  that nearly got me killed in Paris because I spent two weeks with her down in Cannes , squandering my money and blowingup on wine and fancy meals before a fight . By the time the fight was over in Paris , with that Frenchman hitting me with everything but the water bucket , I was ready to take orders and become a monk . " He chuckled . There were other names that came up in his reminiscences of his past for his son 's benefit , names he did not chuckle over : the boy with whom he had set fire to the cross on Boylan 's lawn and who had turned him in ; Schultzy , his manager ; the man he had blackmailed at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had shamed before twenty-seven other members of a ship 's crew and caused to commit suicide . It was as though he felt the boy , starved for a father , now that he had finally found one , might get a false , noble impression of him that Tom could not live up to and had to correct to save the boy from inevitableand bitter disillusionment . What advice he gave was practical . " You like the sea . Follow it . It 's a good life , at least if you get lucky , like me . It 's a nice mixture of laziness and work and variety and you 're out in the open air . In the end , you 'll have the Clothilde or maybe a better boat . Know what it 's all about . Give it loving care , like Dwyer and me . And I 'd advise not screwing the lady guests . " He grinned . Father or no father , he could n't be holy about a young man 's overpowering interest in sex . " Be your own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trap . Learn everything . Above deck and below deck . You got a good chance with me and Bunny and Kate here to watch . Do n't skimp on equipment .

If you catch a guest with drugs , throw the drugs overboard withoutBeggarman , Thief 57any conversation about it . If possible , do n't booze with them . You 'll be able to afford your own booze . Do n't be greedy . The word gets around . Fast . If you do n't like the looks of the sea , make for port , regardless of what some fat cat on board tells you about having to get to Rome or Cannes or Athens for an important business conference or to pick up a girlfriend . Do n't volunteer for any wars . Do n't back down , but do n't pick fights . . ..

" His father 's legacy  --  Do n't skimp on the equipment and keep a gun handy . Wesley did n't know where the gun on the Clothilde was locked away . Probably Bunny knew , but he was sure Bunny would n't tell . It had n't been handy when it was needed . His father talked on in the barred darkness , the voice calm , slightly amused , but the words incomprehensible . The ache in the back of his head throbbed , the memory of his father 's voice dwindled away , like the sound of a buoy left to stern in a fog , and he slept .

Beggarman , Thief 59He had been to the consulate in Nice again , to the jail in Grasse , to which Wesley had been moved , twice during the week and three times to the lawyer 's office . The consul had been vague and apologetic about being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a point , Wesley not helpful , just silent , unrepentant , physically no worse for wear and less interested in his own fate than that of the men imprisoned along with him , among them a jewel thief , a passer of stolen checks and an art forger . He had n't shaved since his arrest and the blondish thick stubble gave him an unkempt and wolfish look , at home among criminals . When he came into the small room in which Rudolph was permitted to speak to him , there was a rank , feral smell , a hunting beast caged in an unsanitaryzoo . The smell transported Rudolph uncomfortably back to the room above the family bakery , the bed he shared with his brother Tom when they were in their teens , when Tom would come back late at night after a night of brawling in the town . He took out his handkerchief and pretended to be blowing his nose as Wesley sat down , grinning a little , opposite him across the small , unpainted , scarred table , guaranteed Provencal antique , provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grasse . Rudolph put on a solemn face , to indicate that this was no laughing matter . The police , through the lawyer , had let Rudolph know that the case was grave  --  a beer bottle might be construed to be a dangerous weapon  --  and that Wesley was not going to be let out of jail for some weeks , if then . Rudolph had also spoken several times to his lawyer , Johnny Heath , in New York , who had told him that if he could extricate himself from the French , in all probability the estate would have to be settled in New York , as the last known residence in the United States of the murdered man , and that it would take time . We will all be drowned in paper , Rudolph thought . He could see the Clothilde going down with all aboard in a sea of writs , court orders and legal foolscap , as he listened to Johnny Heath saying he guessed that the judge would almost certainly appoint Kate Jordache , the wife , even though she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which would probably be divided one-third to her and two-thirds to the son , although the child she was bearing was a complicating factor . The son , being a minor , would have to have a guardian until he reached the age of eighteen , and he did n't see any reason why Rudolph , as the oldest and nearest male relative , could n't have the job . The estate would most probably have to be liquidated and taxes paid , which would mean sell-60 IRWIN SHAW Beggarman , Thief 61ing the Clothilde within the year . But , Heath warned , he could not say definitely as yet  --  he would have to get other opinions . He said nothing to Wesley of the problems that Heath had discussed . He merely asked if he were being treated well , if there was anything he wanted . Carelessly , the boy said that he was being treated like every- body else , wanted nothing . Baffling , unrewarding young man , Rudolph thought resentfully , immutably hostile . He cut the visits as short as pos- sible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no better . Worse , in fact . The scenes with Jean were becoming more violent . She wanted to go home , get out of her prison , as she called it , probably the only time in its history that the Hotel du Cap had been so described . Somehow , she had gotten it into her head that it was Rudolph 's fault that she could n't leave and his telling her that it was the policeman who was holding her passport and not himself could not stem the flood of her hys- teria . " God damn it , " she had said , during their latest argument , " your idiotic brother should have minded his own business . So I 'd 've been fucked . Big deal . It wouldn't 've been the first time an American lady got fucked in France and I 'd 've been on my way home by now . " As the shrill voice battered at his ears , he had a quick vision of Jean as she had been when they had first married , a quick , lovely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the room overlooking the sea ( was it the same room in which she slept now ?  --  he could n't re- member ) , offering to buy him a yacht on that surprising afternoon when she confessed that she , who he had believed before their marriage was a poor working girl , was wealthier by far than he was . Better not think of those days . . . . The fact that Wesley had nearly killed a man Jean took as proof that it was the Jordaches ' inherent lust for violence , not her drunkenness or emotional instability , that had been at the root of the tragedy . " One way or another , " she had screamed at her husband , " with or without me , with their characters , those two men , that man and that boy , were doomed from the beginning . It 's in the blood . " Gretchen , he remem- bered , had said much the same thing and he damned her for it . He had seen Wesley in jail . It was not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pouting , hard-eyed , curvaceous mother  --  Teresa . Who knew what Sicilian bandits had contributed to that rank smell , that wolfish grin ? Guilt , if it was guilt , had to be fairly apportioned . " I know about your crazy father , " Jean ranted on , accusing him , his crime-stained German ancestors . " I do n't know how you and your holy sister escaped it this long . And look at your sister  --  how did her husband die ? Killed , killed , killed . . . . " " In an automobile accident . " Rudolph tried to break through her highpitched , intoning chant . " Fifty thousand people a year . . . " " Killed , " Jean repeated stubbornly . " I 'm frightened to think of what kind of life our child is going to have with you as the father . . . . " Rudolph felt helpless before her attacks . He felt confident of himself , able to solve rational problems , but irrationality frightened him , confusedhim , left him unarmed . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couch , beating her hands against the pillows like a child , sobbing , " I want to go home , I want to go home . . . . " Gretchen , too , although she did n't say anything , was growing restive . She had work to go back to , a man kept telephoning her from New York , the attractions of the Cote d'Azur had long since lost their charm for her , and Rudolph realized that she was only staying on out of loyalty to him . Another debt . Once , during the week , when they were alone together , she asked quietly , " Rudy , has it ever occurred to you to just pull out ? " " What do you mean ? " " I mean quit . It is n't your mess after all . Just pick up and leave . One way or another , they 'll all survive . " " No , " he said shortly , " it 's never occurred to me . " " I admire you , Brother , " Gretchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which she said it . " I admire you and I wonder at you . " " You do n't have to stay , you know . " " I know , " she said . " And I do n't intend to stay forever . I suppose you will , if necessary . " " If necessary . " He had no job to go back to , nobody was calling him from New York . " Add pity to what I just said , Brother , " Gretchen said . " I am now going to go down to the sea and bask in the sunshine . " Kate had not yet called from her hotel and he was thankful to her for that . But he dreaded the moment when he would have to go to her and tell her what had to be done and what it would mean for her . Poor Bunny Dwyer , he thought , as he walked slowly once again through the narrow streets of the old city toward the lawyer 's office  --  old companion , old partner , unprovided for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ N SHAW Beggarman , Thief 63and the work of years not bearing the weight of a feather in any legal balance . The only thing that had kept him sane was the two afternoons in a hotel in Nice with Jeanne . No complications , no iron cables of love or duty to consider , only the unthinking satisfactions of the flesh to make forgetfulness possible for an hour or two in a darkened room rented in a strange town . Was that really the reason he was willing to stay , for those precious afternoons in Nice ? For the selfish sport of double adultery ? Was he being admired and pitied for a lie ? His steps were heavy as he approached the lawyer 's office and the bright sunlight made him sweat uncomfortably . The lawyer had his office in his own house along the ramparts , in two of the old humble stone buildings now turned into a single exquisite mansion , where once the fishermen who sailed out of Antibes had lived , but which , converted and modernized , now were owned by people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oar or survived a squall . Contraryto established economic doctrine , Rudolph thought , the rich follow the poor , not the other way around . At least to the good spots the poor have accidentally found , where they in times past had been the first citizensof the town exposed to pirates , enemy fire and the erosion of storms . The lawyer 's office was impressive , the walls lined with calf-bound legal books , the furniture elegant , dark , eighteenth-century pieces , gleaming with wax , the wide window opening on a view of the sea that lapped at the rampart walls . The lawyer was an old man , but straight and as impressive as his surroundings , beautifully dressed , with large , well-kept hands , sprinkled with liver spots . He had a shining bald pate over a large-nosed , sharp face , and sad eyes . Why should n't he be sad , Rudolph thought , as he shook the old man 's hand , think of what he must have been through to arrive in this room . " I have considerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had seated himself across the great polished desk from him . He spoke English slowly but with care . He had let Rudolph know from the beginningthat he had spent the war years in England . His voice was juicy . " First , about your wife . I have her passport here . " He opened a drawer , bent a little , produced the passport and pushed it gently across the desk toward Rudolph . " The police have found Danovic , the man they wished to question further . They assure me their interrogation was  --  ervigorous . Unfortunately , while he has a police record of previous arrests for various crimes , he has been discharged each time without going to trial . Besides , his alibi has stood up . He was in Lyon all day , having his teeth fixed . The dentist 's records are irrefutable . " " That means what ? " The lawyer shrugged . " That means that unless the police can prove that the dentist lied or that Danovic had accomplices whom he directed or ordered or conspired with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So far , there is no evidence that he knew anything about it . The police would like to continue to question him , of course , but there is no way at the present time that they can hold him . Unless . . . " He paused . " Unless what ? " " Unless your wife wishes to place a charge of attempted rape against him . " Rudolph groaned . He knew that it would be impossible to get Jean to do anything of the kind . " All my wife wants , " he said , " is to go home . " The lawyer nodded . " I quite understand that . And of course , there are no witnesses . " " The only witness was my brother , " Rudolph said , " and he 's dead . " " In that case , I think the best thing your wife could do would be to leave for home as soon as possible . I can imagine the ordeal . . . " No , you ca n't , old man , Rudolph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of himself more than of his wife . " In any case , rape cases are most difficult to sustain , " the old man said . " Especially in France . " " They 're not so easy in America , either , " Rudolph said . " It 's a crime in which the law finds itself in an uncomfortable position , " the lawyer said . He smiled , aged and used to injustice . " She 'll be on the plane tomorrow , " Rudolph said . " Now  --  " The lawyer smoothed the shining surface of his desk with a loving gesture , his white hand reflecting palely off the wood , one problemneatly disposed of . " About your nephew . " He looked obliquely , pale eyes in yellowing pouches of wrinkled skin , at Rudolph . " He is not a communicative boy . At least to me . Or to the police , either , for that matter . Under questioning , he refuses to divulge his motive for attacking the man in the bar . Perhaps he has said something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrewd glance . " Not to me , " Rudolph said . " I have some notions , but . . . " He shrugged . " Of course they would n't mean anything in a court of law . " " So  --  there is no defense . No extenuating circumstances . Physical attacksare regarded seriously under French law . " The lawyer breathed heavily . A touch of asthma , Rudolph thought , or a sign of approval , an unspoken pride in the civilized nature of France where hitting a man with a beer bottle was considered a matter of utmost gravity , as compared with the frontier attitude of America , where everybody struck everybody else with unpunishable lightness of heart . " Luckily , " the lawyer went on , regaining his breath , " the Englishman is well out of danger . He will be discharged in a few days from the hospital . He , himself , has had several brushes with the local police regulations and is not disposed to bring charges . Also , the juge d'instruction has taken into consideration the age of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a spirit of mercy has merely indicated that the boy will be taken to the nearest border or to the airport in the next eight days . Forgive me  --  that is one week in French . " He smiled again , doting on his native language . " Do n't ask me why . " He smoothed the desk again , making a small , papery noise . " If the boy wishes to come back to France , to continue his education , perhaps  --  " With a little genteel snuffle into a handkerchief , the old man implied , with perfect politeness , that education was a rare commodity in America . " I am sure that after a year or so , when it has all been forgotten , I could arrange for him to be allowed back . " " I 'm glad to hear that , " Rudolph said . " From what his father and Mr. Dwyer have told me , he likes it here and has done very well in school . " " He should continue on at the lycee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever wants to get anyplace in the world that , I would say , in our day and age , is the minimum requirement . " " I 'll think about it . And , of course , talk it over with the boy . " " Good , " the old man said . " I trust , my dear friend , that you consider that I have served you well and faithfully and , if I may say so , have used what small influence I have in this  --  this  --  " For once he hesitated over the English word "  --  in this pays  --  this section of the coast  --  to good effect . " " I thank you very much , Maitre , " Rudolph said . At least he had learned how to address a lawyer in France . " How will it all be arranged ? " he asked . " I mean  --  taken to the nearest border ? " He frowned . " I mean , nobody I 've ever known has been taken to the nearest border before . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airily . It was an old , commonplace story for him . " If you will be at the Nice airport with a ticket for the boy one64 IRWIN SHAWBeggarman , Thief 65week from today , he will arrive accompanied by a detective who will make certain that he boards a plane for some other country . The United States , if you wish . Since the man will not be in uniform , it will arouse no curiosity : he will seem like an uncle , a friend of the family , wishing the boy bon voyage . " " Has the boy been told ? " Rudolph asked . " I informed him myself this morning , " the lawyer said . " What did he say ? " " As usual , nothing . " " Did he seem happy , sad ? " Rudolph persisted . " He seemed neither happy nor sad . " " I see . " " I took the liberty of looking at the schedules of the American airlinesthat serve Nice . The most convenient would be the plane that will leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be there , " Rudolph said . He reached out for Jean 's passport and put it in his pocket . " I must compliment you , Monsieur Jordache , " the old man said , " on the calm , the gentlemanly equilibrium with which you have endured this painful episode . " " Thank you . " The moment I leave this beautiful office , Rudolph thought , I will not be calm or demonstrate equilibrium of any kind , gentlemanlyor otherwise . As he started to get up , . he felt dizzy , almost as if he were going to faint , and had to steady himself by putting a hand against the desk . The old man looked at him quizzically . " A bit too much lunch ? " he asked . " No lunch at all . " He had skipped lunch for seven days . " It is important to guard one 's health , " the old man said , " especially when one is in a foreign country . " " Would you like my address in the United States , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me your bill ? " " That will not be necessary , monsieur , " the old man said smoothly . " My clerk has it prepared for you in the outer office . You do not have to bother with francs . A check in dollars will do , if you will be kind enough to send it to the bank in Geneva whose address you will find on the bill . " Impressive , able , surrounded by gleaming eighteenth-century furniture , with a view of the blue sea and an untaxed account in Switzerland , the old man stood up , slowly , careful of his advanced years , and shook Rudolph 's hand , then accompanied him to the door , saying , " En fin , I66 I R W I N SHAW Beggarman , Thief 67must extend my sympathies to you and your family and I hope that what has happened will not prevent you from visiting this lovely part of the world in the future . " First things first , he thought as he walked away from the lawyer 's house along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all the Picassos in it . The bad news to begin with . That meant Dwyer and Kate . He would have to tell them of his conversation with Heath yesterday . Together , preferably , so that there would be no misunderstanding , no suspicion of secret dealing . After that , the good news for Jean and Gretchen , that they were free now to go back home . He relished the thought of neither meeting . Then there would have to be the jail again , some decision made about where and how and with whom Wesley would stay in America . Maybe that would be the worst conversation of all . He hoped the boy had shaved by now . And taken a shower . He stopped and looked out to sea , across the Baie des Anges toward Nice . The Bay of Angels . The French did n't care what they named things . Antibes , for example . Antipolis , the Greek settlers had called it  --  Opposite the City . What city ? Athens , a thousand miles away by oared galley ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lucky Greeks . What were the laws then , what had those exemplary politicians judged a fair punishment for a boy who had hit someone in a tavern with a beer bottle ? What civic spirit or lust for fame or profit had driven the lawmakers among the statutes and the measured rhetoric to leave their academies and festivals to seek election , take on the burden of ruling that intelligent and warlike race ? He himself had made speeches on the hustings , had cajoled , promised , heard the cheers of crowds , won and accepted office . Why ? He could n't remember now . There was a bustle of traffic around him , even on the narrow stone road along the top of the ramparts . Antibes had once been a sleepy , forgottentown , but it was crowded now by the beneficiaries or the victims of the twentieth century , leaving winter behind them in the rush to the climate of the south , to work and live there , not only to play . Flowers and light industry . He himself was a northern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ south himself . If what had happened here had not happened , he might have settled cosily here , anonymous , unknown , retired gratefully , as some men did , in his thirties . He had the rudiments of French  --  think of Jeanne  --  he could have worked at it , learned to readVictor Hugo , Gide , Cocteau , whatever new men were worth reading , visited Paris for the theater . Dreams . Impossible now . He breathed deeply of the salt balmy air off the sea . Almost every place was open for him , but not this particular , haunted , beautiful place . He started walking again , down from the ramparts toward the port . He would get Dwyer to find Kate and they could have their discussion in a cafe , because Kate had said she never wanted to see the Clothilde again . She might have changed her mind by now , with the first shock over , she was not a sentimental woman , but he was not the one who was going to force her . Just at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cafe . At a tiny table in front of it Dwyer was sitting with a woman , her back to Rudolph . When he called out to Dwyer the woman turned and he saw that it was Kate . She was thinner now , or was it the black dress she wore that made her look so ? The nut brown of her complexion had faded and her hair was careless around her face . He felt a twinge of anger or something akin to anger . Knowing everything that he was trying to do for her , she had not even bothered to call to tell him where she was staying , and here she was sitting with Dwyer , the two of them looking like an old married couple , sharing secrets in the sunshine . She stood up to say hello to him and he was embarrassed . " May I join you for a moment ? " he asked . There were moments and moments . Without a word , Dwyer drew up a chair from the next table . He was dressed as usual , tanned , muscular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the white jersey with the printing on it . What mourning he carried was not on public display . " What will you have to drink ? " Dwyer asked . " What are you two drinking ? " " Pastis . " " Not for me , thanks , " Rudolph said . He did n't like its sweet , licorice taste . It reminded him of the long , black , pliant sticks of candy , like miniature snakes , that his father had bought for him when he was a boy . He was in no mood to be reminded of his father . " If I could have a brandy ? " Dwyer went into the cafe to fetch the brandy . Rudolph looked across the table at Kate . She was sitting there stolidly , no emotion showing on her face . She could be a Mexican peasant woman , Rudolph thought , all work done for the moment , sitting in front of an adobe wall in the sunlight , waiting for her husband to come home from the fields .

" Heath had told him that was probably what the judge would do . " Executrix . I do n't know tuppence about executrix , " Kate said . " Anyway , I plan to go back to England . Bath . My ma 's there and I can go on the National Health for the baby and my ma can watch after it when I go out to work . " " What sort of work ? " Rudolph asked . " I was waitress in a restaurant , " Kate said , " before I listened to the call of the sea . " She laughed sardonically . " A waitress can always find work . " " There 'll be some money left , " Rudolph said , " when the estate 's settled . You wo n't have to work . " " What 'll I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telly ? " Kate said . " I 'm not an idler , you know .

" Whatever money there is , and I do n't imagine there 'll be much after the lawyers and them others , I 'll put aside for the kid 's education . Educated , if it 's a girl , maybe she wo n't have to wait on table and iron ladies ' dresses in a steaming ship 's laundry , like her ma . " There was no arguing with her . " If you ever need anything  --  money , anything , " he said , without hope , " please let me know . " " There wo n't be any need , " she said , lowering her eyes again , still twirling her glass on the table . " Just in case , " Rudolph said . " Maybe , for example , one day you 'd like to visit America . " " America 's no attraction for me , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America . " " Would n't you want to see Wesley again ? " " Would n't mind , " she said . " If he wants to see me , there 're planes every day from America to London . " " In the meantime , " Rudolph went on , trying to keep the note of pleading out of his voice , " while the estate 's being held up , you 'll need some money . " " Not me , " she said . " I have my savings . And I made Tom pay me my wages , just like before , even when we were sleeping in the same bed and fixing to marry . Love is one thing , I told him , " she said , a proudered her eyes , refusing to look at him , a baked mud wall around her primitive thoughts . He sensed hostility . Had the parting kiss when she left the Clothilde been a sardonic salute ? Or had it been real , meant then and later regretted ? " How is Wesley ? " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me all about it . " " He 's all right . They 're letting him leave France a week from today . Most probably for the States . " She nodded . " I thought they might , " she said . Her voice was low and flat . " It 's better that way . He should n't hang around this part of the world . " " That was a foolish thing he did , " Rudolph said , " getting into a fight like that . I do n't know what could 've come over him . " " Maybe , " Kate said , " he was saying good-bye to his father . " Rudolph was silent for a moment , ashamed of what he had said . He felt the way he had the day he had left the consulate for the first time , weeping in the streets . He wondered if his cheeks were wet with tears now . " You know him better than I do , " he said . He had to change the subject . " And how are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound tender . She made a curious , deprecating , blowing sound . " As well as might be expected , " she said . " Bunny 's been company . " Maybe they ought to get married , Rudolph thought . Two of a breed .

" I knew where I could find you , " she said levelly , " if I had piss-all to say to you . " Bunny came back with the brandy and two fresh glasses of pastis . Rudolph watched as they poured the water into the glasses and the pastis turned milky yellow . Rudolph raised his glass mechanically . " To . . . " He stopped , laughed uncertainly . " To nothing , I guess . " Dwyer raised his glass , but Kate just slowly twirled her glass on the table . The brandy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his throat . " There have been certain developments that I think you ought to know about . . . " I must stop sounding as though I 'm addressing a board meeting , he thought . " I 'm glad I found you both together . . . " Then , as clearly as he knew how , he explained the meaning of what Heath had told him about the estate . They listened politely , but without70 IRWIN SHAWdeclaration of categories , " and work is another . " She finally lifted her glass and sipped some of the pastis . " I give up . " Rudolph could n't help sounding exasperated . " You sound as if I 'm your enemy . " She stared at him , blank pueblo eyes . " I do n't rightly remember sayinganything that could be construed like enemy . Did I , Bunny ? " " I was n't really paying much heed , " Dwyer said uneasily , " I could n't pass judgment . " " How about you ? " Rudolph turned to Dwyer . " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a saving type of man , " Dwyer said . " Tom used to tease me , saying I was mean and miserly . I 'm well set , thank you . " Defeated , Rudolph finished his brandy . " At least , " he said , " leave me your addresses . Both of you . So I can keep in touch . " " Leave Wesley 's address with the shipyard here , " Kate said . " I 'll drop them a line from time to time and they 'll pass on a card . I 'd like to let him know whether he 's got a sister or brother when the time comes . " " I 'm not sure where Wesley will be , " Rudolph said . He was beginning to feel hoarse , his throat rasped by the brandy and the effort of talking to these two evasive , stubborn human beings .

" I would n't want your wife to be reading any mail of mine , " she said , putting down her glass . " My wife does n't open my mail , " Rudolph said . He could n't help sounding angry now . " I 'm glad to see she 's a woman of some character , " Kate said . There was just the hint of a malicious glint in her eye , or was he imagining it ? " I 'm only trying to be of help , " Rudolph said wearily . " I feel an obligation . . . " He stopped , but it was too late . " I thank you for your intentions , " Kate said , " but you 're under no obligation to me . " " I say we just would do better not to talk about it , Mr. . . . Rudy , " Dwyer said . " All right , let 's not talk about it . I 'm going to be in Antibes for at least a week . When do you plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wrinkles in the lap of her dress with her two hands . " As soon as I get my things together . " Rudolph remembered the single , scuffed , imitation-leather suitcase Wesley had carried off the Clothilde for her . It probably could n't takeher more than fifteen minutes to get her things together . " How long do you think that will take ? " Rudolph asked patiently . " Hard to tell , " Kate said . " A week . A fortnight . I have some goodbyesto make . " " I 'll have to have your address here , at least , " Rudolph said . " Somethingmay come up , may have to be signed in front of a notary . . . " " Bunny knows where I am , " she said . " Kate , " Rudolph said softly , " I want to be your friend . " She nodded slowly . " Give it a little time , mate , " she said harshly .

They 'll be arriving any day now with the new shaft and the new screw and that 'll mean hauling her up on dock for at least three days , that is if the insurance comes in . . . . You could do me a favor  --  get after the insurance . They 're slow as shit if you do n't get after them . And you 'd know how to talk to them better than me . So if ...

" " To be sure , you have , " Kate said . If it was ironic , there was no tellingit from her tone . Rudolph stood up . " I have to go back to the hotel now . What do I owe here ? " " The drinks 're on me , " Dwyer said . " My pleasure . " " I 'll keep you posted about what 's going on , " Rudolph said . " That 's kind of you , " said Dwyer . " I 'd like to see Wesley before he leaves for America . " " You 'll have to see him at the airport , " Rudolph said . " He 's going right there from the jail . With a policeman . " " French cops , " Dwyer said . " It do n't pay to let them get their hands on you , does it ? Tell Wesley I 'll be at the airport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Both of you . " They did n't answer , but sat there in silence with their glasses in front72 IRWIN SHAWof them , in shadow now , because the sun was going down and the buildingacross the street was blocking it out . Rudolph made a little gesture and walked back toward the Agence de Voyages near the square where he could buy the three plane tickets for tomorrow 's flight . Husband and wife , he thought bitterly , as he passed the antique shops and the cheese shops and the shops that sold newspapers , they 'd make a good pair . What 's wrong with me ? What makes me so goddamn sure I can take care of anybody ? Everybody ? I 'm like those idiotic dogs at the greyhound races .

BUT IT SET ME THINKING AND I WAS UP HALF THE NIGHT WORRYING ABOUT MYSELF AND MY CONNECTION TO LANGUAGE . ( Gretchen was in the bar when Rudolph got back to the hotel . She was drinking a champagne cocktail and talking to a young man in tennis clothes . She had been doing quite a bit of drinking the last few days , which was not like her , and had been talking to any men who happened to be around , which , he thought , maliciously , was very much like her . Had he heard footsteps softly passing his door last night , past the paired shoes , in the direction of her room ? Remembering Nice , he could hardly complain . And whatever diversions she found to amuse herself with in the limbo in which she found herself were at the very least excusable . " May I introduce my brother , Rudolph Jordache , " she said as Ru- dolph came over to the table at which they were sitting . " Basil  --  I forget your second name , dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cocktails , Rudolph thought , to say dear to a man whose name she 'd forgotten . The young man stood up . He was tall and slender , actorish , dyed hair , frivolously good-looking , Rudolph decided . " Berling , " the young man said , bowing a little . " Your sister 's been telling me about you . " Berling , Basil Berling , Rudolph thought , as he nodded acknowledg- ment of the bow . Who has a name like Basil Berling ? British , from his accent . " Wo n't you sit down and join us ? " Basil Berling said . " Just for a moment , " Rudolph said , without grace . " I have some things I have to discuss with my sister . " " My brother is a great discusser , " Gretchen said . " Beware his discus- sions . " Four cocktails , not three , Rudolph thought . " What will it be , sir ? " Basil Berling asked , polite British member of Actors Equity , working hard on his speech , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the waiter came up . " The same , " Rudolph said . " Three of the same , " Basil Berling said to the waiter . " He 's been plying me with drinks , " Gretchen said . " So I see . " Gretchen made a face . " Rudolph is the sober one in the family , " she explained to Basil Berling . " Somebody has to be . " " Oh , dear , I fear the discussion to follow , " Gretchen said . " Basilwhatis the name again , dear . . . ? " She 's pretending to be further gone than she really is , Rudolph thought . To annoy me . Today I 'm everybody 's target . " Berling , " the man said , always pleasant . " Mr. Berling is an actor , " Gretchen said . " Is n't it a coincidence , " she asked , her tone girlish and drunk at the same time , " here we are at the very end of the world and we meet by sheerest jolly happenstance in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " She was mocking him now with a fake English accent , but the young man seemed beyond offense . " Are you ? " The Englishman sounded surprised . " I mean in films ? I say  --  I should have guessed . " " Is n't that gallant ? " Gretchen touched Rudolph 's arm flirtatiously , brother or no . " I have to admit the fearful truth . I 'm in the unglamorouspart . " She sipped at her new drink , smiling over the rim at Basil Berling . " Hard to believe , " Berling said heavily . Must get rid of him forthwith , Rudolph thought , before I ask the manager to throw him out . " Oh , yes , " Gretchen said . " Behind the scenes . I 'm one of those ladies with the black fingernails . Up to my ass in acetate . Film editor . There , now , the secret 's out . Just a plain , humble cutter . " " You do honor to the profession , " Basil Berling said . God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought , as Gretchen said , " Sweet , " and patted the back of Berling 's hand . For a moment Rudolph was curious about how his sister really was in bed , how many men were in her past , her present . She 'd tell him if he asked . " Gretchen , " Rudolph said , as Gretchen tilted her head with too much charm at the actor , " I have to go up and tell Jean she has to pack . I have her passport and she 'll want to be leaving tomorrow . I 'd like a word with you first , please . " Gretchen made a pretty grimace . Rudolph would have liked to slap her . The day 's events had worn his nerves thin . " Drink up , dear , " 76 IRWIN SHAW Gretchen said to Berling . " My brother is a busy man , the conscientious bee going from flower to flower . " " Of course . " The actor stood up . " I 'd better get out of these clothes , anyway . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down with a mon- strous cold if I sit around wet much longer . " " Thanks for the wine , " Gretchen said . " My pleasure . " Dwyer had said , " My pleasure , " too , Rudolph remembered . Every- body was enjoying himself this afternoon , he thought sourly . Except him . " Will I see you later , Gretchen ? For dinner ? " Berling said , tall , but with skinny , stringy legs , Rudolph noticed . I 'd look better in tennis shorts , he thought meanly . " I daresay , " Gretchen said . " A pleasure to have met you , sir , " Berling said to Rudolph . Rudolph grunted . If the man was going to call him sir , as though he were on the edge of the grave , he 'd be crusty , as befitted his age . Brother and sister watched the actor stride out , springy and virile , treading the boards . " God , Gretchen , " Rudolph said , when the actor had gone , " you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? " " There 's very little choice at this season , " Gretchen said . " A girl has to take what comes along . Now , what unpleasant thing are you in such a hurry to tell me ? " She was n't drunk at all , he saw . " It 's about Enid , " he said . " I 'd like you to get on the plane with Jean and Enid tomorrow and keep an eye on her . On both of them . " " Oh , God , " Gretchen said . " I do n't trust my daughter with Jean , " Rudolph went on doggedly . " What about you ? Are n't you coming along ? " " I ca n't . There 's too much still to attend to here . And when you get to New York I want you to stay with them in my apartment . Mrs. John- son 's off on a holiday in St. Louis for another week . " " Come on now , Rudy , " Gretchen said . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Damn it , Gretchen , " Rudolph said , " after all I 've done for you . . . " Gretchen put her head back and closed her eyes as though by that physical act she was holding back an angry reply . Still in the same posi- tion , and with her eyes still closed , she said , " I do n't have to be re- minded every day of what you 've done for me . " " Every day ? " Rudolph bit off the words . " When was the last time ? " " Not in so many words , my dear brother . " She opened her eyes and leaned forward again . " Let 's not argue about it . " She stood up . " You 've got yourself a baby-sitter . Anyway , it will be nice to be back again in a place where murders happen in the newspapers , not in the bosom of your own family . What time does the plane leave ? " " Eleven-thirty . I have your ticket . " " Think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everything . " " I would n't know what to do without you , Brother , " Gretchen said . " I 'd better start packing myself . " She smiled at him , but he noticed the effort . " Truce ? " " Truce , " he said . On the way to the elevator he stopped at the desk to get his key . " While you were out , Mr. Jordache , " the concierge said , " a lady came by and left a letter for you . " He took an envelope out of the box and gave it to Rudolph with his key . The envelope had only his name on it , in a woman 's handwriting that he felt he had seen someplace before . In the elevator he tore open the envelope and picked the single piece of paper out of it . It was from Jeanne . Dear American , This is just to tell you to please not call me . You can guess the reason why . I 'll call you when I can . It may not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they have called off the war in Paris permanently . I hope you are having a good time in Antibes and are prolonging your stay . The afternoons are dreary without you . If you wish to write me , do it through Poste Restante , Central Post Office , Nice . I hope I have spelled everything correctly . Drive carefully , JeanneHe crumpled the letter and put it in his pocket , got out of the elevator , went over to the door of the suite , arranged his face , put the key in the lock and went in . Jean was standing at the window , staring out to sea . She did n't turn around when he came in . Against the fading light which came through the open window , her silhouette was slender and young in a linen summerdress . She reminded him of the girls he had gone to college with , girls who wore their boyfriends ' fraternity pins on their bosoms and went to the Saturday-afternoon football games in bulky fur coats and78 I R W I N SHAW bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played the trumpet in the band , to help pay his way through school . Standing at the door , looking at the illusion of vulnerable youthfulness which his wife created , he felt a pang of pity for her , unsought , unprofitable . " Good evening , Jean , " he said , advancing toward her . Jean , Jeanne , he thought . What 's in a name ? She turned slowly . He saw that she had had her soft , shoulder-length hair done that day and that she had put on makeup . The old woman she would one day be had gone from her face . " Good evening , " she said gravely . Her voice , too , had returned to normal , if normal for her meant not rasping with drink or fury or self- laceration . " Here 's your passport , " he said , giving it to her . " The lawyer got it back today . " " Thank you , " she said . " I have your ticket for the plane tomorrow . You can go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said again . " And you ? " " I 'll have to stay at least a week more . She nodded , opened her passport , glanced at her photograph , shook her head sadly , threw the passport on the table . My passport photo does n't flatter me either , Rudolph would have liked to say . " At least a week . . " Jean said . " You must be exhausted . " " I 'm all right . " He sank into an easy chair . Until she had said he must be exhausted he had n't realized how tired he really was . He had been sleeping badly , waking often in the middle of the night , with un- easy dreams . Last night he had had the most curious , disturbing dream . He had awakened with a start . The bed had seemed to be shaking and the first thought he had had was that there was an earthquake . In his dream , he had remembered , he seemed to have been pinched all over his legs by invisible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his dream . Awake , he had thought , Now where did that word come from ? He had read it , of course , but he had never spoken it or written it . " How is Enid ? " he asked . " Fine , " Jean said . " I took her to Juan-les-Pins this afternoon and bought her a miniature striped sailor 's jersey . She looks charming in it and she 's been posing in front of the mirror in it ever since . She 's having her supper now with the nurse . " " I 'll look in and say good night to her , " he said . " In a while . " He loosened his collar and tie . Unyoked for the day , he would put on an open-necked sports shirt for dinner . " Gretchen will be on the plane with you and Enid , " he said . " She need n't bother , " Jean said , but with no hint of resentment . " Perhaps she 'd like to stay on . The weather 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea with a handsome young man . " " She 's anxious to get back to New York , " he said . " I 've asked her to stay with you and Enid until Mrs. Johnson gets back from St. Louis . " " That will be dull for her , " Jean said . " I can take care of Enid myself . I have nothing else to do . " But again calmly , without resentment or the tone of argument . " I think it would be better if Gretchen was there to help out , " he said carefully . " Whatever you say . Although I can stay sober for a week , you know . " " I know , " he said . " Just to be on the safe side . " " I 've been thinking , Rudy , " Jean said , standing with her hands clasped in front of her , her fingers interlaced , as though she were on a platform giving a prepared speech . " About what we 've been through . " " Why do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rudolph said . He was in no mood for prepared speeches . " I 've been thinking about us , " she said evenly , without hostility . " For your sake and for Enid 's , I think we ought to get a divorce . " Finally , he thought . At least I was n't the one to say the word . " Why do n't we wait awhile to talk about things like that ? " he said gently . " If you want . But I 'm no good for you . Or for her . You do n't want me anymore . . . . " Jean put up her hand , although he had n't begun to say anything . " You have n't come near me in over a year . And you 've found somebody down here , I 'm sure . Please do n't deny it . " " I wo n't deny it , " he said . " I do n't blame you , dear , " she said . " I 've been poison for you for a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And the crowd would have cheered . " She smiled crookedly . " I wish you 'd wait until we were both home in America . . " he started to say , although he felt that a great weight was being lifted from his shoulders . " I feel like talking this evening , " she said , without insistence . " I 've been thinking about us all day and I have n't had a drink in more than a80 IRWIN SHAWweek and I 'm as sane and sensible as I 'm ever going to be for the rest of my life . Do n't you want to hear what I 've been thinking about ? " " I do n't want you to say anything that you 're going to regret later . " " Regret . " She made a little awkward movement , as though she were jerking away from a wasp . " I regret everything I say . And just about everything I 've done . Listen carefully , my dear . I am a drunk . I am disappointedwith myself and I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a drunk all my life . And I wo n't get over it . " " We have n't tried hard enough up to now , " he said . " The places you 've gone to were n't thorough enough . There are other clinics that . . . " " You can send me to every clinic in America , " she said . " Every psychiatristin America can poke among my dreams . They can give me antabuseand I can vomit my guts out . And I will still be a drunk . And I will scream at you like a shrew and disgrace you . . . . Remember , I did it before and not only once . . . and I can ask for forgiveness and I can do it again and I can risk my child 's life driving her around drunkenly in a car and I can forget everything and go looking for a bottle over and over again until the day 1 die and I wish it was going to be soon only I do n't have the courage to kill myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Please do n't talk like that , Jean , " he said . He stood up and went toward her , but she pulled away , as though she feared his touch .

I will retire to myself somewhere , out of sight  --  is Mexico far enough away ? Spain ? I speak Spanish , did you know that ? Switzerland ? The clinics are excellentthere , I am told , and for two or three months at a time you can expectgreat results . " " Okay , " he said , " let 's live two or three months at a time then .

I 'll hire aBeggarman , Thief 81nice , strong young woman , probably a lesbian , who will keep me com- pany and make sure I come to no harm when I am steeped in drink . . . and if necessary will supply me with innocent and undangerous sex ....

" He stood up and went over and put his arms around her . She was trembling violently . Her face was flushed and she felt feverishly hot to his touch . " I 'm sorry , " she whispered , trembling in his arms , her head against his chest , her arms gripping him . " I suppose I should have made this speech long ago  --  before we were married , maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before I was married . " " Sssh , sssh , " he said , helplessly . " When you get home things will look different . " " When I get home , " she said , " the only difference will be that I 'll be one day older . " She pulled away , smiled wanly at him . " It 's hard to think of that as any great improvement . Now go take your shower . I 'll be less eloquent when you come out and there 'll be a martini here for you to remind you that all is not lost . I 'll join you for the cocktail hour . With another Coca-Cola . " In the shower he allowed himself to weep . Somewhere along the years there must have been a moment when she could have been saved . He had been too busy , too preoccupied , to recognize the moment , make the necessary gesture toward her , before all avenues of escape finally closed to her . He could n't seem to regulate the temperature of the water . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin like a thousand needles or when he turned the knob it spurted out icy cold , freezing him , making him shiver , as though he were standing naked in a sleet storm . He got out , dried himself with a big rough towel , looking at himself in the long mirror , ashamed of his trim , adulterous body , the muscles all neat , strong , useless in the life he lived , his sex an impediment to charity . Chair , he thought . Flesh , in French . Close enough , at least in spelling , to charity . Save that , he thought bitterly , for the afternoons in Nice . He dressed slowly , the expensive , well-fitting clothing agreeable against his skin . The body 's small , restorative pleasures . He put on a light wool shirt , soft cashmere socks , pressed flannel trousers , snug polished moccasins ( the Communists in the corridors at night ) , a crisp seersucker jacket . Gretchen would not say tonight that he looked as though he had just been laid . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went back into the salon , and Jean was standing in front of the window staring out at the fragrant darkness pierced by bright points of color as the lights ofBeggarman , Thief 83the coast that swept away west from the peninsula of Antibes went on . Jean had lit a single lamp and had a glass of Coca-Cola in her hand . She turned when she heard him come in . " Gretchen called while you were in the shower , " she said . " I told her we were having dinner alone . Is that all right with you ? " " Of course . " " She 's having dinner in Golfe Juan with a friend , anyway , she said . " " I met him , " Rudolph said . " I often wonder how she gets along with men . She does n't confide in me . " " She confides in me too much , " Rudolph said . " As does all the world , " Jean said lightly . " Poor Rudolph . " She wanderedaimlessly around the room , touching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the desk . " Tell me , Rudy  --  I do n't quite remember , " she said . " Is this the room we had when we came here just after we were married ? " " I do n't remember , either , " he said and picked up the martini . " Well , " she said , lifting her glass , " here 's to . . . to what ? " She smiled . She looked beautiful and young in the shadowed room . " To divorce , say ? " She sipped at her Coca-Cola . Rudolph put his glass down . " I 'll have my drink later , " he said . " I want to go in and say good night to Enid . " " Go ahead , " Jean said . " I believe you ought to give the French girl a nice little bonus . She 's been very good with Enid . Very gentle and patient . She 's almost a child herself , but somehow she always seems to have been able to invent games to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have . " " Nor do I , " Rudolph said . " Do n't you want to come with me ? " " Not tonight , " Jean said . " Anyway , I have to make some repairs on my face . " " I wo n't be long . " " No hurry , " she said . " We have the whole night ahead of us . " Enid was just finishing her supper , dressed in the striped seaman 's jersey . She was laughing when Rudolph came into the room . Somehow , although the nurse could n't speak English , the two of them seemed to understand each other perfectly . Education , Rudolph thought , with a pang , will wipe out that particular shared gift . He kissed the top of Enid 's head , said , " Bon soir " to the girl . The girl said in French , " I 'm sorry about the shirt . She has had her bath all right , but she wouldn't84 IRWIN SHAWput on pajamas ; she insists she wants to sleep tonight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I did n't think it was worth a struggle . . . . " " Of course not . " Sensible , flexible Frenchwoman . " She 'll sleep all the better for it . " Then he told her to please have the child 's things packed in the morning , as they were leaving for New York . By the time I 'm through here , he thought , I 'll be able to speak enough French even to talk to a Corsican policeman . One for the plus side . The girl said , " Bien , monsieur . " Rudolph took a long look at his daughter . She looked healthy and happy , with a light bloom on her cheeks from the sun . Well , he thought , another plus ; at least someone 's getting some good out of this trip . Seeingher sitting there , contentedly playing with her food , and suddenly reaching out to hold the girl 's hand , he thought , when I get back to New York I 'm going to fire Mrs. Johnson . Mrs. Johnson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was n't one for games . He kissed the top of Enid 's head again and bent down farther as she said , " Good night , Daddy , " and planted a wet , oatmeally kiss inaccuratelyon his cheek . She smelled of soap and talcum powder and if the girl had n't been there he would have picked her up from the chair on which she was sitting , propped up on pillows , and hugged her , hard . But he merely said , " Good night , little sailor , sleep well , " and went out of the room . The dinner was excellent , the moon shone over the sea , the restaurant was uncrowded and the waiters buzzed devotedly around their table . Jean insisted that he order a bottle of wine for himself and he allowed himself to be persuaded . They found they had a great deal to say to each other , none of it important or troubling , and there were no uncomfortablelapses in the conversation . We are all made out of rubber , Rudolphthought , admiring Jean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; we stretch all out of shape and then , at least to all appearances , snap back again , back to the original form , or almost back to the originalform . They lingered a long time over coffee , looking , he was sure , content with themselves , with each other , in front of the big window that gave on the dark sea , with its silver path of moonlight shimmering away toward the distant islands . They walked slowly up to the hotel and when they came into the suite , Jean said , " Get into bed , darling . I 'll be in in a little while . " Naked , he lay in the bed in the dark room , waiting . The door openedBeggarman , Thief 85softly ; there was a rustling as Jean took off her robe and then she was in bed with him . He put his arm around her , her body not trembling , warm , but without the blaze of fever . They did n't move and in a little while they both were asleep . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an earthquake or that he was visited by poltergeists . Farther down the hall , Gretchen slept uneasily , alone . The dinner had been delicious , the wine had flowed freely , the young man had been almost the handsomest man in the room and had been attentive , then importunate : she had nearly said yes . But finally , she was sleeping alone . Before she dropped off , she thought , If only my goddamn brother had n't said , " You certainly know how to pick them , do n't you ? " she would n't have been sleeping alone that night . CHAPTER . 7FROM BILLY ABBOTT 'S NOTEBOOKHAPPENED TO PICK UP A COPY OF THE INTERNATIONAL ISSUE OF THE WEEK 'S " TIME " MAGAZINE .

Gretchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Enid a little tearful because the French girl was being left behind . Rudolph had checked for the third time that he had all their plane tickets , and the chauffeur was holding the front door open for him to get in , when a car drove up to the courtyard in front of the hotel and stopped . A small , plump , plainly dressed woman with graying hair got out of the car and a small plump man in a business suit emerged from behind the wheel . " Rudolph Jordache , if you please , " the woman called , coming toward him . " Yes ? " The woman looked vaguely familiar. 88 IRWIN SHAW Beggarman , Thief 89 " I suppose you do n't remember me , " the woman said . She turned to the small plump man . " I told you he would n't remember me . " " Yes , you told me , " the man said . " I remember you , though , " the woman said to Rudolph . " Very well . I 'm Tom 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my son . " She dug into the big handbag she was carrying and pulled out a copy of Time Magazineand waved it at Rudolph . " Oh , Lord , " Rudolph said . He had forgotten about the newspapermanand the telex . But the newspaperman obviously had n't forgotten about him . Poor Wesley , he thought , his name known for a week in millions of homes , the stares of the curious to be dealt with for years to come , the strangers approaching him wherever he went , saying , " Excuse me , are n't you the one . . . ? " " May I see what the story 's like ? " Rudolph reached out for the magazine . The journalist had been down to the boat before Wesley had been jailed , but he might have followed up on the story . He winced , thinking of what Time might have done with the account of Wesley 's fight in the nightclub and the Englishman in the hospital with a concussion . Teresa drew back , put the magazine behind her . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . " According to what it says , you can damn well afford it . You and your fancy naked wife . " Oh , God , Rudolph thought , they 've dug up that old picture . What a blessing it would be for the entire world if the files in the office of every newspaper on the face of the globe suddenly went up in smoke in a singleday . " It 's all in the magazine , " Teresa said malevolently . " This time your money did n't bail my great ex-husband out , did it ? He finally got what he was looking for , did n't he ? " " I 'm sorry , Teresa , " Rudolph said . Tom must have been dead drunk or drugged when he married her . The last time Rudolph had seen her , three years ago in Heath 's office , when he had paid her off to go to Reno for a divorce , her hair had been dyed platinum blond and she must have been twenty pounds lighter . Looking no better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me for not recognizing you . You 've changed a bit . " " I did n't make much of an impression on you , did I ? " Now the malevolence was more pronounced . " I 'd like you to meet my husband , Mr. Kraler . " " How do you do , Mr. Kraler ? " The man grunted . " Where 's my son ? " Teresa said harshly . " Rudy , " Gretchen called from the car , " we do n't want to miss the plane . " She had n't heard any of the exchange . Rudolph began to sweat , although it was a cool morning . " You 'll have to excuse me , Mrs. Kraler , " he said , " but we have to go to the airport . . . " " You do n't get off that easy , Mr. Jordache , " Teresa said , waving the rolled-up magazine at him . " I did n't come all the way here from America to let you fly off just like that . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his voice rising , to match the woman 's tone . " I have to put my family on the plane and I 'm coming back here . I 'll see you in two hours . " " I want to know where my son is , " Teresa said , grabbing his sleeve and holding on as he started to get into the car . " He 's in jail , if you must know . " " In jail ! " Teresa shrieked . She put her hand to her throat in a tragic gesture . Her reaction reassured Rudolph . At least that part of the story had n't been in the magazine . " Do n't carry on so , " Rudolph said sharply . Her shriek had been the loudest noise he had heard at the hotel since he had come there . " It 's not that serious . " " Did you hear that , Eddie ? " she screamed . " My son is behind bars and he says it 's not serious . " " I heard him say it , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family it is . Put a child in their hands , " as loudly as before , " and before you know it he has a police record . It 's a blessing his father got murdered or else I 'd never have known where he was and God knows what these people would have made out of him . You know who belongs in jail  --  " She released Rudolph 's sleeve and stepped back a pace to point a shaking , accusatory finger at him , her arm outstretched operatically . " You ! With your tricks and your bribes and your crooked money . " " When you calm down , " Rudolph said , moving to get into the front seat of the limousine , - " I 'll explain everything to you . " Then to the chauffeur , " Allons-y . " She lunged at him and gripped his arm again . " No , you do n't , " she said . " You 're not getting off that easy , mister . " " Let go of me , you silly woman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk to you now . The plane wo n't wait , no matter how loudly you scream . " 90 I R W I N SHAW Beggarman , Thief 91 " Eddie , " Teresa shrieked at her husband , " are you going to let him get away with this ? " " See here , Mr. Jordache . . . " the man began . " I do n't know you , sir , " Rudolph said . " Keep out of this . If you want to talk to me , be here when I get back . " Roughly , he shook the woman 's hand off his sleeve , and the concierge , who had come out to say goodbye , moved , quietly threatening , toward her . Rudolph got into the car quickly and slammed and locked the door behind him . The chauffeur hurried around to the wheel and started the engine . Teresa was standing , waving the magazine angrily at the car , as they drove out of the gate . " What was that all about ? " Gretchen asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " It 's not important , " Rudolph said shortly . " She 's Wesley 's mother . " " She certainly has changed , " Gretchen said . " Not for the better . " " What does she want ? " " If she 's running true to form , " he said , " she wants money . " He would have to get Gretchen aside and tell her to make sure Jean did n't get hold of a copy of Time Magazine . From the terrace of the airport building Rudolph watched the plane take off . The good-byes had been quiet . He had promised to get back to New York as soon as possible . He had tried not to think of the comparisonbetween today 's subdued farewell and the holiday gaiety with which they had arrived at this same airport , with Tom waiting for them with his bride-to-be and the Clothilde in port ready to take them all out to the channel between the islands off Cannes for a swim and a reunion lunch . When the plane was out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighting down the temptation to buy a copy of Time Magazine at the newsstand . Whatever the story was like , it certainly could not bring him joy . He wondered how people who were constantly being written about , politicians , cabinet ministers , actors , people like that , could ever bring themselves to open a morning newspaper . He thought of the plump , graying woman and her round little husbandwaiting for him back at the hotel , and sighed again . How had that dreadful woman ever managed to find a husband ? And a second husband , at that . Perhaps , he thought , if the man from Time were still in Antibes , he should ask him to dig up the newspaper photograph of Teresa , with her old fake name , being taken away by the police after the raid on the brothel . One photograph deserved another . Poor Wesley . Delaying , he asked the chauffeur to drive into Nice , directed him to the street on which Jeanne lived . He did n't know what he would do if by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her children or her martial husband . Nothing , most likely . But she did not appear . The street was like any other street . " Back to the hotel , please , " he said . " Go the long way , along the sea . " When they got to Antibes , they skirted the port . He saw the Clothilde , in the distance , with Dwyer , a tiny figure , moving on the deck . He did not ask the chauffeur to stop . " I know my rights , " Teresa was saying . The three of them were sitting on the chairs in a little glade in the park of the hotel , where there was no one to hear their conversation . The couple had been sitting stiffly in two chairs facing each other in the hotel lobby when Rudolph had come in . Their expressions were grim and disapproving , their presence a silent rebuke to the idle , pleasure-seeking guests , dressed for sport , who passed them on their way to tennis or to the swimming pool . They had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explaining quickly , keeping his voice calm and neutral , how Wesley had fallen into the hands of the police and about his departure for America . " We 've been to a lawyer in Indianapolis , where we live , Mr. Kraler and myself , and I know my rights as a mother . " Teresa 's voice grated on his ears like chalk on a blackboard . " Wesley is a minor and with his father dead , the lawyer said I am his legal guardian . Is n't that what the lawyer said , Eddie ? " " That 's what the lawyer said , " Mr. Kraler said . " Exactly . " " When I get him out of jail , " Teresa went on , " I 'm going to take him back to a proper home where he can get a decent Christian upbringing . " " Do n't you think it would be wiser to leave religion out of this ? " Rudolph said . " After all , the life you 've led . . . " " You do n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Kraler knows all about it . Do n't you , Eddie ? " " All about it . " Eddie nodded , little pudgy sacks of flesh under his chin shaking rhythmically . " I was a whore , and no bones about it , " Teresa said , almost with pride . " But I 've seen the light . The strayed lamb is dearer in the eyes of the Lord . . . " She hesitated . " You know the rest , I 'm sure , even if you and your whole family are lost heathens . " 92 IRWIN SHAW " Actually , " Rudolph said , with false innocence , " I do n't know the rest . " " It makes no difference , " she said quickly . " Mr. Kraler is a Mormon and by his efforts I have been converted and accepted into the fold . For your information , I do n't dye my hair any longer , as you may have noticed , if you ever stoop to notice anything about me , and I do n't drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be most admirable , Teresa , " Rudolph said . He had read somewhere that Mormonism was the fastest-growing Christian religion in the modern world , but with Teresa in the fold the believers must feel that they had cast their net too wide . He could imagine the shudder in the Tabernacle in Salt Lake City when the elders of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints had to accept Teresa Jordache into their blessed company . " But I do n't really see what that 's got to do with Wesley . " " One thing that it 's got to do with him is that he 'll stop being a jailbird . I know your family , I know the Jordaches , do n't think I do n't . Fornicators and mockers , all of you . " Teresa 's vocabulary , Rudolph noted , had expanded considerably with her conversion . He was not sure it was an improvement . " I do n't really think that Wesley 's being in jail for a few days because he had a fight in a bar is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " And for your information , " he could n't help adding , " fornication and mocking are not my principal occupations . " " I 'm not accusing anyone , " Teresa said , although there was accusationin every syllable she spoke and every gesture she made . " But it ca n't be denied that he was in your charge , you being his uncle and head of the family when he nearly killed a man . . . . " " All right , all right , " Rudolph said wearily . He wanted her to leave , disappear , with her pudgy , purse-lipped , righteous husband , but the thought of Wesley being at the mercy of the couple back in Indianapolis appalled him . He did n't know what he could do to prevent it , but he had to try to do what he could . " What do you want ? " He had explained that Wesley was to be put on a plane to America in six days , but he had n't told her of his own hardly formed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America for a year and then sending him back to France to continue his education there , or his own plan ( selfish ? generouslyavuncular ? ) to come back to France himself to keep an eye on the boy . Beggarman , Thief 93 " What do I want ? " Teresa repeated . " I want to make him a decent citizen , not a wild animal in the jungle , like his father . " " You realize , of course , " Rudolph said , " that in a little more than two years , he 'll be eligible for the draft if he stays in the United States , and may be sent to get killed in Vietnam . " " If that is God 's will , that is God 's will , " Teresa said . " Do you agree with me , Eddie ? " " God 's will , " Mr. Kraler said . " My son is in the Army and I 'm proud of it . The boy has to take his chances , just like everybody else . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mine , " Teresa said . " Do n't you think you ought to ask Wesley what he wants to do ? " " He 's my son , " Teresa said . " I do n't have to ask him anything . And I 'm here to make sure he 's not going to get gypped of his just share in his father 's big fat estate . " Ah , Rudolph thought , now we come to the heart of the matter . " When that fancy yacht they wrote about in the magazine is sold , " Teresa said shrilly , " you can bet your boots that I 'm going to be looking over everybody 's shoulder to make sure my son is n't left out in the cold . And our lawyer is going to go over every slip of paper with a fine-tooth comb , do n't make any mistake about that either , Mr. Jordache . " Rudolph stood up . " In that case , " he said , " I do n't think there 's any need to continue this conversation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be appointed as executrix for the estate , will hire a lawyer and the two lawyers can work everything out between them . I have other things to do . Good-bye . " " Wait a minute , " Teresa said . " You ca n't keep running off like that . " " I have to take a nap , " Rudolph said . " I 've been up since dawn . " " Do n't you want to know where we 're staying here ? " she cried , victoryslipping from her grasp , the argument won so easily that she was sure that it was a ruse on her opponent 's part . " Our address in America ? Mr. Kraler is a highly respected merchant in Indianapolis . He 's a bottler . He has three hundred people working for him . Soft drinks . Give him your card , Eddie . " " Never mind , Mr. Kraler , " Rudolph said . " I do n't want to have your address here or in Indianapolis . Bottle away , " he added crazily . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Teresa cried . " I want to see what they 've done to my poor son . " " Naturally , " Rudolph said . " By all means , do so . " Her maternal instinctshad been less evident in Heath 's office when he had paid her off94 IRWIN SHAW Beggarman , Thief 95and she had signed away custody of her son at the sight of a check made out in her name . " I intend to adopt him legally , " Mr. Kraler said . " Mrs. Kraler wants him to forget he was ever called Jordache . " " That will have to be settled between him and his mother , " Rudolph said . " Although when I visit him in jail I 'll mention the idea to him . " " When 're you going to the jail ? " Teresa asked . " I do n't want you talking to him alone , filling his ear with poison . . . . I 'm going with you . " " No , you 're not going anyplace with me , " Rudolph said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unaccompanied . " " But I do n't speak French , " she wailed . " I do n't even know where the jail is . How will I convince the cops I 'm his mother ? " " I 'm afraid you 'll have to figure all that out yourself , Mrs. Kraler , " Rudolph said . " Now I do n't want to see either of you two people ever again . Tell your lawyer that the law firm he will have to get into contact with is Heath , Burrows and Gordon . The address is in Wall Street . I believe you were there once before , Mrs. Kraler . " " You bastard , " Teresa said , un-Mormon-like . Rudolph smiled . " Have a pleasant afternoon , " he said . He nodded and left the two plump , little angry people sitting silently on the bench in the shade of the pine trees . He was trembling with rage and frustrationand despair for the poor boy in the jail in Grasse , but for the momentthere was nothing he could do about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tear Wesley out of the grasp of his mother , and today he was not up to thinking even about the first step to be taken . Christian or not , when there was the scent of money in the air , Mrs. Teresa Kraler remembered the habits of her ancient profession . He dreaded having to tell Kate what was in store for her . He packed quickly . The concierge had gotten him a reservation at the Colombe d'Or in Saint-Paul-de-Vence . A hotel in Grasse would have been closer to the jail he visited almost daily . Saint-Paul-de-Vence was closer to Jeanne . He had chosen Saint-Paul-de-Vence . There was no reason for his remaining any longer at the Hotel du Cap and many reasons for leaving it . He had told the concierge to forward his mail , but under no circumstances to tell anyone where he was staying . He wrote to Jeanne , telling her where he was going to be , and sealed the note in an envelope addressed to her , care of Poste Restante , Nice . When he went down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bags werebeing put in his car , he was relieved to see that the Kralers had gone . He was shocked at the size of his bill . You pay a lot for agony , he thought , on the ate d'Azur . It was one of the best hotels in the world , but he knew he would never come back to it again . And not because of the cost . He drove first to the port . Dwyer and Kate had to know where to find him . Dwyer was polishing one of the small brass bitts up forward when he came aboard . He stood up when he saw Rudolph and they shook hands . " How 're things ? " Rudolph asked . Dwyer shrugged . " It ai n't no holiday , " he said . " They ai n't delivered the shaft and the propeller yet . They have to come from Italy and the Italians ai n't going to send it across the border until they get paid . I been on the phone to the insurance every day , but they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sending me new forms to fill out , " he said aggrievedly . " And they keep asking for Tom 's signature . Maybe the Italians do n't think anybody dies in France . And I have to keep getting everything translated . There 's a waitress in town who 's a friend of mine , she got the language , only she do n't know fuck-all about boats and she had to keep asking for the names of things like equipment , running lights , fathoms , flotsam , things like that . It 's driving me up the wall . " " All right , Bunny , " Rudolph said , suppressing a sigh . " Send all the papers to me . I 'll have them attended to . " " That 'll be a relief , " Dwyer said . " Thanks . " " I 'm moving to the Colombe d'Or in Saint-Paul-de-Vence , " Rudolph said . " You can reach me there . " " I do n't blame you , moving out of that hotel . It must have cost you a pile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You look around you , " Dwyer said , " all those big boats , all these expensive hotels , and you wonder where the money comes from . At least I do . " " Bunny , " Rudolph said , absurdly feeling on the defensive , " when I was young I was poorer than practically anyone you ever knew . " " Yeah . Tom told me . You worked like a dog . I got no beef against people who came up the way you did . I admire it . I would say you 're entitled to anything you can get . " " There 're a lot of things I can get , " Rudolph said , " that I 'd gladly give away . " " I know what you mean , " Dwyer said . There was a short , uncomfortable silence between them. 96 I R W I N SHAW " I had hoped Kate would be here with you , " Rudolph said . " Some- thing 's come up that she has to know about . How is she ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to decide whether or not he should tell him anything about Kate . " She 's gone , " he said . " She left for England this morning . " " You have her address ? " " I do . Yeah , " Dwyer said carefully . " I need it , " Rudolph said . As quickly as possible , he told Dwyer about the Kralers ' visit , about the legal problems that Kate would have to deal with , or at least would have to be handled in Kate 's name . Dwyer nodded slowly . " Tom told me about that wife of his . A real ball-breaker , is n't she ? " " That 's the least of her virtues , " Rudolph said . He saw that Dwyer was hesitant about giving him Kate 's address . " Bunny , " he said , " I want to ask you something . Do n't you believe that I 'm trying to do the best for Kate ? And for Wesley ? And for you , too , for that matter ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " About Kate  --  " He made his curious , almost feminine gesture with his hands , as if explain- ing the situation in words was beyond him . " I know she sounded . . . well . . . snappish the other day . It 's not that she 's sore at you or any- thing like that . I 'd say , what it is  --  " Again the little gesture . " It 's that she 's  --  " He searched for the word . " She 's bruised . She 's a sensible woman ; she 'll get over it . Especially now that she 's back home in Eng- land . You got a pencil and a piece of paper ? " Rudolph took a notebook and pen out of his pocket . Bunny gave him the address and Rudolph wrote it down . " She does n't have a tele- phone , " Bunny said . " I gather her folks ai n't rolling in money . " " I 'll write her , " Rudolph said , " when anything develops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the polished rails and brasswork . " The ship looks fine , " he said . " There 's always something to be done , " Dwyer said . " I made a date to have it hauled up in the yard two weeks from today . The goddamn stuff ought to be here from Italy by then . " " Bunny , " Rudolph asked , " how much do you think the Clothilde is worth ? What it would sell for ? " " What it 's worth and what it would sell for are two different things , " Dwyer said . " If you figure what it cost originally and all the work and improvements Tom and me put into it and the new radar you gave him as a wedding present  --  that 'll have to be installed , too  --  I 'd say it would come to almost a hundred thousand dollars . That 's what it 's worth . But if you have to sell it fast , like you said when you were telling us about settling the estate  --  and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  nobody likes to pay for the upkeep of a boat for a whole winter  --  if people 're going to buy , they 're most likely to buy in the late spring  --  if you have to sell it fast in the off months and people know you have to sell , why then , naturally , they 'll try to cut your throat and maybe you 'd be lucky if you got fifty thousand dollars for it . Anyway , I 'm not the one to talk about this . You ought to go around , talk to some of the yacht brokers here and in Cannes , Saint-Tropez , you see what I mean , maybe they have somebody on their books 'd be interested for a fair price . . . . " " Has anybody approached you so far ? " Rudolph asked . Dwyer shook his head . " I really do n't think anybody who knows Antibes'dmake a bid . After the murder and all . I think you 'd do better to change the name and sail her to another harbor . Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maybe even in Piraeus , that 's in Greece . . . . People 're superstitious about ships . " " Bunny , " Rudolph said , " I do n't want you to get angry at what I 'm going to say , but I have to talk to you about it . Somebody 's got to stay with the boat until it 's sold . . . . " " I would think so . " " And he 'd have to be paid , would n't he ? " " Yeah , " Dwyer said uncomfortably . " What would the usual salary be ? " " That depends , " Dwyer said evasively , " how much work you expected him to do , if he was an engineer or not , things like that . " " You , for example . If you were on another ship ? " " Well , if I 'd been hired on earlier  --  I mean people 've got their crews fixed by now  --  I guess about five hundred dollars a month . " " Good , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred dollars a month . " " I did n't ask for it , " Dwyer said harshly . " I know you did n't . But you 're going to get it . " " Just remember I did n't ask for it . " Dwyer put out his hand and Rudolph shook it . " I just wish , " Dwyer said , " there was some way of Tom knowing all you 're doing for me , for Kate and the kid , for the Clothilde . " Rudolph smiled . " I did n't ask for it , " he said , " but I got it . " Dwyer chuckled . " I think there 's still some whiskey left on board , " he said. 98 IRWIN SHAW " I would n't mind a drink , " Rudolph said . As they went aft , Dwyer said , " Your sister , Mrs. Burke  --  Gretchen  --  made me into a whiskey drinker . Did she tell you ? " " No . She kept your romance secret . " He saw that Dwyer did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the whiskey in the wheelhouse , warm . Dwyer apologized for not having any ice . He did n't want to have the generator that sup- plied the electricity running , wasting fuel . " It 's a funny thing , " Dwyer said , relaxed now , with the glass in his hand . " You and Gretchen and Tom all in the same family . " He took a big gulp of his drink . " Fire and ice , " he said obscurely . Rudolph did n't ask him to explain what he meant by that . As he left , Rudolph said , " If I do n't see you before then , I 'll see you at the airport when Wesley leaves . You remember the date ? " " I have it written down , " Dwyer said . " I 'll pack his things for him and bring them along with me . " He hesitated , coughed a little . " He 's got a whole folder full of photos up forward . You know  --  pictures of the ship , ports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Kate . . . . That sort of thing . Should I pack them in ? " He lifted his glass and closed his eyes as he drank , as though the matter were of no great importance . " Pack them in , " Rudolph said . Memory hurt , but it was necessary baggage . " I got a whole bunch of pictures from the wedding . All of us . . you know  --  drinking toasts , dancing , stuff like that , all of us . . . . " " I think it would be a good idea to leave them out , " Rudolph said . Too much was too much . Dwyer nodded . " Kate did n't want them either . And I do n't think I have room to keep them . I 'll be traveling finally , you know . . . . " " Send them to me , " Rudolph said . " I 'll keep them in a safe place . Maybe after a while Wesley would like to see them . " He remembered the pictures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other ones with them . Dwyer nodded again . " Another drink ? " " No , thanks , " Rudolph said . " I have n't eaten lunch yet . Would you like to join me ? " Dwyer shook his head . " Kind of you , Rudy , " he said , " but I already ate . " Dwyer had a quota , Rudolph saw . One favor accepted a day . No more . They put their glasses down , Dwyer carefully wiping away with a cloth the damp the glasses left . He was going forward to finish polishing the bitts as Rudolph left the Clothilde . After he had checked in at the new hotel Rudolph had lunch on the terrace overlooking the valley that looked as though it had been designedfrom a painting by Renoir . When he had finished lunch , he made a call to the old lawyer in Antibes . He explained that the Clothilde was for sale and that he would like the lawyer to act as agent for the estate in the transaction . " If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " is not at least one hundred thousand dollars , let me know . I 'll buy it . " " That 's most gentlemanly of you , " the lawyer said , his voice thin over the faulty telephone wires . " It 's a simple business matter . " " I see , " the lawyer said . They both knew he was lying . No matter . After that Rudolph called Johnny Heath in New York and talked at length . " Oh , what a mess , " Heath said . " I 'll do my best . I await the letterfrom Mr. and Mrs. Kraler 's lawyer with impatience . " Then Rudolph put on his swimming trunks and did forty laps in the pool , his mind empty in the swish of water , his body used and healthily tired by the time he had finished . After the swim he sat drying off by the side of the pool , sipping at a cold beer . He felt guilty for feeling so well . He wondered , displeased with himself for the thought , how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was for him and a voice announced that the plane with his family aboard had gone down into the sea .

I MISS MONIKA. ** NWesley was sitting , cleanly shaved , neatly dressed in a suit that Rudolphhad brought him from the Clothilde , waiting for the agent who was to take him to the airport . The suit had been bought for him by his father more than a year ago and was now very much too short in the arms and too tight across the chest . As he had expected , his Uncle Rudolph had somehow fixed it for him . Although having to leave France was n't such a great arrangement . He had never been happy in America  --  and he had been happy in France , at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so bad in the prison in Grasse . The cop he had hit in the bar was stationed in Cannes and had n't been around to bug him , and among the guards and with the juge d'instruction who had examinedhim he had enjoyed a certain celebrity because of what had happened to his father and because he spoke French and had knocked out102 I R W I N SHAW I Beggarman , Thief 103the Englishman , who had had a moderate reputation as a barroom fighter with the local police . Also he had been polite and had caused nobody any trouble . The occasional bill his uncle had slipped to the guards and a call from the American consulate , which his uncle had prompted , had n't hurt , either . One good thing about Uncle Rudy , he never even hinted that Wesley ought to show some gratitude for what he 'd done for him . Wesley would have liked to show gratitude but he did n't know how . Eventually , he thought , he 'd have to work on that . As it was , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncle , who seemed embarrassed to see Wesley behind bars , as though it was somehow his fault . One of the guards had even smuggled in a photograph from the police files of the man called Danovic his father had had the fight with in the Porte Rose . Wesley would remember the face when it was necessary to recognize it . He said nothing of this to anyone . He had never been an open boy  --  even with his father it had been difficult for him to talk about himself , although his father had told him almost everything he wanted to hear about his own life . Now , he kept what he was feeling to himself . He felt threatened , although he was n't certain what was threatening him . Whateverit was , silence was the first line of defense . He had learned that a long time ago , when his mother had put him in that damned military school . His mother was another ball game . She had screamed and cried and scolded and slobbered all over him and promised him he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her new husband in Indianapolis . He did n't want to lead a different life . He had asked his uncle if he had to go to Indianapolis and Rudolph had looked sad and said , " At least while you 're still a minor . " It had something to do with money , he did n't understand just what . No matter . He could take a look at the scene and blow if he did n't like it . He had learned about flight . Meanwhile , he missed not being able to go to school when the year began . They were starting the basketball season in September . He had been the star of the team last year and he knew they had been dependingupon him this year . He hoped they had a lousy season , so they would know how much they needed him . It seemed a piddling thing to be worrying about when your father had just been murdered , but school was a big part of his life and he could n't just turn it off because it wouldbe unimportant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have understood , even if nobody else did . Some of the boys had made fun of him in school because he was American and spoke funny . He had never hit them , as he had wanted to , because his father would have beat the shit out of him if he had found out Wesley was fighting . It would be different now , he thought grimly . With the sorrow , there was a new sense of freedom . I make my own mistakes now , he told himself , and people can just lump them or leave them . The mistake his father had made would take a lot of getting over . He had prayed for his father , but he 'd be damned if he forgave him . One night , one crazy grandstand act , and his father had left him in the shit . Shit , he thought , sitting in his clean clothes , shit . The agent who was going to take him to the airport unlocked the door and came in . He was dressed in slacks and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dancer and anybody would know he was a cop , right off . The air smelled wonderful outside . He had forgotten how good air could smell . They got into an unmarked car , Wesley sitting in front beside the agent . The agent had a big belly and let out a little poof through his brokennose as he squeezed in under the wheel . Wesley would have liked to ask if he had ever been hit with a beer bottle or shot a man , but decided it would be better to keep the conversation on other things . The agent drove slowly down the winding mountain road , with all the windows open . " The weather is beautiful , " he said , " we might as well profit from it . " It was an easy morning 's work for him and he was makingthe most of it . He already smelled from wine . " So , " he said , " no more France for you . Pity . Next time you will learn to hit people where there are no witnesses . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you going to do in America ? " " Keep away from the police , " Wesley said . The agent laughed again . " That 's a smart young man . My wife keeps after me . We ought to visit America , she says . " He wagged his head . " On a policeman 's salary , you can imagine . " He looked sidelong at Wesley . " Your uncle is a man of important wealth , is n't he ? " he asked . " One of the richest . " " It shows . " The policeman sighed , looked down at his rumpled jacket . " I admire his clothes . He is a man of great authority . That is evident . No wonder you 're on the way home . " 104 IRWIN SHAWHome was not the word to describe where he was going , Wesley thought . " You will come back here eventually  --  as a tourist  --  and spend a great deal of money , I suppose , " the agent said . " If you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prison there had been two men who said they were Communists and the day was near . " Do n't say things like that , " the agent said darkly . " Especially in America . They will turn their backs on us . " On the subject now of the bad opinion Americans had of the French , he said , " You are not going back and tell the newspapers how you were tortured by the police to make you confess ? " " I had nothing to confess , " Wesley said . " Everybody saw me hit the salaud . I might say something about how one of your friends beat me up in the car on the way to the prefecture , though , " he added mischievously . He was enjoying the ride through the ripe , flowery countryside after the weeks indoors . And just talking idly away with the man , who was friendly enough , postponed having to think what was waiting for him at the airport and in Indianapolis . " Ah , what would you expect ? " the agent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blow by a child in full view of the entire world and not get a little bit of your own back in a dark car ? We are all human , you know . " " All right , " Wesley said magnanimously , " I wo n't say anything . " " You 're a good boy , " the agent said . " You made a good reputation for yourself in Grasse . I have seen the man your father had the fracas with . He looked as though he had been run over by a locomotive . " He nodded , an expert in these matters . " Your father did an excellent job . Excellent . " He looked sidelong again at Wesley , his face serious now . " The fellow is known to the police . Unfavorably , " he said . " So far he has been able to escape the punishment he richly deserves . He associates with dangerous men . It is as much for your sake as for the sake of France that you are being sent on your way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " that a man that everybody knows is responsible for a murder can get away with it . " " You just forget about what people know , my friend , " the agent said censoriously . " You just forget everything and go home and be a nice young American . " " Yes , sir , " Wesley said , remembering every detail in the photograph , the slit eyes , the high , sharp cheekbones , the thin mouth and dark curlyBeggarman , Thief 105hair . You forget the man who killed my father , he wanted to say , but did n't . You just try and forget . " I wonder if you could do me a favor . " " What is it ? " The agent 's voice was professionally suspicious . " Could you drive along the port ? I 'd like to take a look at the boat . " The agent glanced at his watch . " It 's early yet , " he said . " We have time . Why not ? " " That 's very kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C'est tres gentil de votre part , monsieur , " in French . It was one of the first things his father had taught him when he had brought him to Antibes . Although his father knew almost no French , he had said , " There 're two expressions the Frogs pay a lot of attention to . First  --  S'il vous plait , that means please . And C'est tres gentil de votre part . Got it ? Repeat them . " Wesley had not forgotten the lesson . " I have a son about your age , " the agent said . " He 's crazy about boats , too . He 's always hanging around the ports , whenever he gets a chance . I told him I 'd disown him if he ever became a sailor . If it was n't for all the boats down here , the police would be put out of work . The people it attracts , " he said gloomily , " Algerians , Yugoslays , Greeks , Corsicans , Sicilians , nudists , English kids in trouble with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , rich playboys with giant dope habits . . . " He shook his head as he went over the list of seaborne malefactors . . . . " And now every stinking town with a view of the Mediterranean is building a new port . It will take the entire gendarmerie of France to control it . Witness your case . " He shook his finger angrily at Wesley , reminded by his outburst that he was conducting a criminal to exile . " Do you think what happened to you would have happened if you inhabited Clermont-Ferrand , for example ? " " My case was an accident , " Wesley said , sorry he had asked to see the port . " That 's what they all say . And who has to clean up the mess ? The police . " " What would you like your son to be ? " Wesley thought it was time to change the subject . " A lawyer . That 's where the money is , my boy . Take my advice , go back to America and be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have ever been in jail ? " " I was considering it , " Wesley said , hoping to get the cop back into his earlier expansive mood . " Consider it seriously . " 106 IRWIN SHAW " I intend to , " Wesley said , sage and appreciative and wishing that the cop would shut up . " And do n't ever carry a weapon . Do you hear me ? " " Yes , sir . " " Listen to the advice of an older man who is interested in the next generation and who has seen the world . " Now Wesley knew why they had picked this particular cop for the er- rand this morning . Anything to get him out of the prefecture and avoid having to listen to his lectures . The cop grumbled , wordlessly , and lit a cigarette , the car swaying dangerously as he took his hands momentarily off the wheel . The smoke came Wesley 's way and he coughed . Neither his father nor Bunny had smoked . " And do n't ever smoke , either , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habit . " He lapsed into silence . When they came to the port , Wesley saw the Clothilde , its decks deserted . Unreasonably , he half expected to see his father come out of the wheelhouse and pull at a line . His father had always been nervous that a sudden storm might arise and the lines would give way . Stop it , Wesley thought , stop it , he 's not going to come on deck ever again . For a moment he wondered what would happen if he suddenly opened the door of the car and jumped out and ran . He could lose the fat cop in a minute , hide out , slip onto the Clothilde at night and handle her out of the port into the open sea , make for Italy . That was the nearest border , actually . Would the cop use his gun ? It bulged in a shoulder holster under his sports jacket . Too risky . Crazy . Today , at least , he had to be sane . He would come back to Antibes another day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stepped on the accelerator . Wesley closed his eyes . He did n't want to look at the Clothilde any- more . Rudolph and Dwyer were waiting for him at the check-in counter at the airport . Dwyer had Wesley 's canvas and leatherette bag with him and was carrying a big manila envelope . " Your mother and her husband , " Rudolph said , " have gone through passport control already . They 'll look for you inside . They 're on the same plane with you . " Wesley nodded . He could n't trust himself to speak . " All is in order , Monsieur Jordache , " the agent said respectfully . " I 'll go through with him and put him on the plane . " " Merci , " Rudolph said . " Here 's your things , " Dwyer said , indicating the bag . " You 'll have to have it weighed . " Dwyer had put on a suit for the occasion . Wesley did n't remember having seen Dwyer in a whole suit before , not even at the wedding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot older , with tiny , fine wrinkles in his forehead and around his mouth . " And this , " Dwyer said , giving him the envelope , " has some of the photos you kept up forward . I thought you might like to look at them sometime . " His voice sounded wandery , vague . " Thanks , Bunny , " Wesley said , taking the envelope . Rudolph gave him a slip of paper . " There are two addresses on that , Wesley , " he said . " My home address and my friend Johnny Heath 's office , in case I 'm off someplace . If you ever need anything . . . " He , too , sounded unsure of himself . He 's not used to seeing members of his family being seen off from one country to another by a cop , Wesley thought as he took the slip of paper and put it in his pocket . " Take care of yourself , " Dwyer said , as Rudolph gave Wesley 's ticket to the girl behind the counter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't you worry about me , old shipmate , " Wesley said , trying to sound hearty . " Never . " Dwyer smiled , but it did n't look like much of a smile . " See you around , eh ? " " Sure . " He did n't even try to smile . " Well , " the cop said in French , " time to go . " Wesley shook hands with his uncle , who looked as though he would be seeing Wesley in an hour or two and Dwyer , who looked as though he would never see him again . Wesley did n't glance backward as he went through passport control with the agent , who showed his identification card as he came up to the desk and winked at the officer there . His mother and her husband , whom he had never seen before , were standing in the departure lounge just as he passed through the control , as if to make sure he was n't going to escape . " You look pale , " his mother said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though she had been caught in a force ten gale . " I feel fine , " he said . " This is my friend . " He touched the agent 's arm . " He 's a policeman . He does n't speak English . " The agent bowed a little . The affair had passed off without incident108 IRWIN SHAWand he could afford to be gallant . " Explain to them that I have to see you safely aboard , " he said in French . Wesley explained . His mother drew back as though the policeman had an infectious disease . " Meet your new father , " his mother said . " Mr. Kraler . " " Welcome , " Mr. Kraler said , like a master of ceremonies on televisiongreeting a famous guest . He extended his hand . " Keep your hands off me , " Wesley said calmly . " Do n't worry about him , Eddie , " his mother said . " He 's disturbed today . That 's natural . He 'll learn . Do you want a drink , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A whiskey , " Wesley said . " Now see here , young man . . . " Mr. Kraler began . " He 's joking , " his mother said hastily . " Are n't you joking , Wesley ? " " No . " A woman 's voice was announcing the departure of the plane over the loudspeaker system . The agent took his arm . " I 'll accompany you aboard , " he said in French . " Those 're my orders . " Maybe , Wesley thought as he walked toward the gate , I should have taken my chances when we were down at the port . His mother and her husband followed them closely . Rudolph drove Dwyer toward Antibes . Neither of them said a word on the entire trip . When they reached the entrance to the port , Dwyer said , " I 'll get off here . I have to see someone . " Both he and Rudolph knew that he was going to stop at the little cafe and get drunk and that he wanted to be alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " A week or so , " Rudolph said . " Until I get it all cleared up . " " See you , " Dwyer said , and went into the cafe , unbuttoning the collar of his shirt and tearing off his tie and stuffing it carelessly into his pocket . Rudolph started the car again . In his pocket he had a letter from Jeanne . She would meet him for lunch at the Colombe d'Or and could see him every afternoon that week . The war in Paris was on again , she had written . When the seat belt sign went off in the cabin of the plane as it turned west in the sky above Monte Carlo , Wesley was looking at the photographsthat had been in the envelope that Dwyer had given him . He did n't notice his mother cross the aisle to stand over him . She lookedBeggarman , Thief 109down at the photographs in his hand . Suddenly , she reached over and grabbed them all . " You wo n't need these anymore , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget . " He did n't want to make a scene , not this soon anyway , so he did n't say anything . He watched as she stood there in the aisle , tearing the photographs one by one and dropping the pieces in the aisle . She did n't have any objections to making scenes , he thought . Boy , it was going to be great in Indianapolis . He looked out the window and saw the peninsula of Antibes , green and beloved , sliding away into the blue sea below him .

The Colonel had seen Billy play when Billy was only a corporal and had liked Billy 's style , which was cool and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ball twice as hard as he did . Billy was also very quick and could cover three-quarters of the court in doubles . Since the Colonel was forty-seven years old , he needed a partner who could cover three-quarters of the court . So now Billy was no longer a corporal , but a master sergeant in command of the motor pool , a job that meant considerableextra money beyond his sergeant 's pay , what with an occasional grateful tip from officers who had motorized business to conduct that was not officially Army business , and the not so occasional opportunity to sell Army gasoline clandestinely at prices cannily just below the prices in the city . The Colonel also invited Billy to dinner . He liked to know what the enlisted men were thinking , as he often said , and the Colonel 's wife thought Billy was a charming young man and behaved like an officer , especially in civilian clothes . The Colonel 's wife liked to play tennis , too , and lived in hope of the day when the Colonel would be sent off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Billy behind . Beggarman , Thief 115It was not the Old Army , the Colonel sometimes said , but you had to keep up with the times . While the Colonel was his commanding officer there was no danger that Billy would be sent to Vietnam . Billy knew that it was through his Uncle Rudolph 's good offices in Washington that he had been spared the unpleasant sound of hostile fire and one day he would show his gratitude . Right now , he had in his t pocket a letter from his uncle which contained a check for one thousand dollars . Billy 's mother had run dry as a source of funds , and Monika , to ) I , whom Billy had spoken about his rich uncle , had pushed him into writingfor money . She had been mysterious about why she needed it , but Billy had long ago resigned himself to the fact that she was a mysterious girl . She never told him anything about her family in Munich or why she had taken it into her head at the age of eighteen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was always going off on secret appointments , but except for that , most of the time was extremely agreeable to live with . That had been the condition on which she had moved into his cosy little flat off the Place . He was to ask no questions when she said she had to be away for an evening or sometimes a week . There were some delicate meetings among the delegates to NATO that could not be talked about . He was not a curious young man when it came to matters that did not concern him . Monika was not really pretty , with her black , tangled hair and lowheeledshoes and sensible stockings , but she had large blue eyes that lit up her face when she smiled and a lovely small figure . The small was important . Billy was only five feet six inches tall and slightly built , and he did n't like the feeling of inferiority taller women gave him . If he had been asked on this evening what profession he intended to follow he would most probably have said that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Monika would get angry with him and denounce him for his lack of ambition . With his engaging youthful athlete 's smile , he would agree with her that he had no ambition . The melancholy darknessof his eyes , fringed by heavy black lashes , gave his smile an extra value , as though he had made a special sad effort at gaiety for its recipient . Billy knew enough about himself not to turn the smile on too often . Tonight was one of the times Monika had a mysterious appointment . " Do n't wait up for me , " she said as they gazed at the spotlit gilt magnificence of the Place 's walls and windows . " I may be late . Maybe all night . " " You 're ruining my sex life , " he said. 116 IRWIN SHAW " I bet , " she said . Trinity College , plus the troops of NATO , had given her an easy command of both the English and American languages . He kissed her lightly and watched her get into a cab . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broad jump at a track meet . He admiredher energy . He could n't hear the address that she gave the driver . It occurred to him that every time he put her in a cab , he never heard where she was going . He shrugged and strolled toward a cafe . It was too early to go home and there was nobody else he especially wanted to see that night . In the cafe he ordered a beer and took out the envelope with the check and his uncle 's letter in it . There had been an exchange of letters , quite cordial , since Billy had seen the item in Time Magazine about Tom Jordache 's death and the awful photograph of Rudolph 's wife naked that they 'd dug up somewhere . He had n't mentioned the photographin the letter to Rudolph and had been sincere , or as sincere as he could be , with his condolences . Uncle Rudolph had been chatty in his letters , with all the family news . He sounded like a lonely man who did n't know quite what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if reticently , of his divorce and the claiming of Cousin Wesley by the lady from Indianapolis . He had not mentioned the police record of Wesley 's mother as a common prostitute , but Billy 's own mother had not been sparing in details . His mother 's letters tended to be stern and admonitory . She had never forgiven him for his refusal to keep away from the army  --  she would have enjoyed playing the honored martyr , he felt resentfully , if he had gone to jail instead . Everyone to his or her principles . For himself , he preferred playing tennis with a forty-seven-year-old colonel and living in comparative luxury with a bright , shapely , multilingual , and  --  admit it  --  a beloved fraulein in the civilized city of Brussels . His letter to his uncle asking for a loan had been graceful and rueful rather than importunate . There had been some unlucky poker games , he had hinted , an expensive automobile breakdown , the necessity to buy a new car . . . Rudolph 's letter , which had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had made it clear that he expected to be repaid . Monika wanted the cash the next morning and he would have to go to the bank . He wondered what she might need it for . What the hell , he thought , dismissing the subject , it 's only money and it 's not even mine . He ordered a second beer . Beggarman , Thief 117In the morning he discovered what she wanted the money for . She woke him up when she came in at dawn , made him a cup of coffee , sat him down and told him the thousand dollars was to be used to bribe a sergeant at the Army arms depot , so that the people she was working with , whom she would n't name or describe , could go in with a U.S. Army truck , which he , Billy , was expected to supply from the motor pool , and lift an unspecified number of guns , grenades and rounds of ammunition . He himself was not to be involved in the deal . Only to the extent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with authentic orders , and delivering it half a mile down the road to a man who would be dressed as a U.S. Army MP lieutenant . The truck would be back before dawn . She said all this calmly , while he sat in silence , sipping his coffee , wondering if she had been on drugs all night . In the course of her explanation , given in the same even tones she might have used back in Trinityat a seminar on an obscure Irish poet , she also explained that he had been picked as her lover because of his job at the motor pool , although she admitted that she had become fond of him , very fond , since then . He tried to control his voice when he finally spoke . " What the hell is all this stuff going to be used for ? " " I ca n't tell you , darling , " she said , stroking his hand across the kitchen table . " And you 'll be better off never knowing . " " You 're a terrorist , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other , " she said , shrugging . " I might prefer the word idealist , or a phrase like seeker after justice or an enemy of torture or just plain lover of the ordinary , traumatized , brainwashed common man . Take your pick . " " What if I just went to NATO and told them about you ? About this crazy scheme ? " He felt silly sitting there shivering in a small , cold , bourgeoiskitchen , dressed only in an old bathrobe that was half open , with his balls hanging out , talking about blowing people up . " I would n't try that , darling , " she said . " First of all they would never believe you . I 'd say that I had told you I 'd leave you and this was your weird way of getting revenge . And some of the boys I know can be very nasty customers indeed . . . . " " You 're threatening me , " he said . " I guess you could call it that . " By the look in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Serious was exactly the word . And deadly . He felt cold and frightened . He had never posed as a hero . He had never even had a fistfight in his life . " If I118 IRWIN SHAW do this , this once , " he said , trying to keep his voice from quavering , " I never want to see you again . " " That 's for you to decide , " she said evenly . " I 'll tell you at noon , " he said , his mind racing , searching for a way he could get out of the whole thing , fly to America , hide out in Paris , London , escape the whole insane , surrealist plot in six hours . " That will be time enough , " Monika said . " The banks are open in the afternoon . But I must tell you , for your own sake  --  you will be watched . " " What the hell kind of woman are you ? " he shouted , his voice out of control . " If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said , without raising her voice , " you 'd know by now , after living with me as long as you 've done . " " I do n't know what 's so frivolous and self-satisfied about not wanting to kill people , " he said , stung by her description of him . " Do n't be so goddamned smug . " " Every day , " she said , " you put on a uniform . In the same uniform , thousands of young men your age go out every day to kill hundreds of thousands of people who never did them any harm . I consider that friv- olous . " As she talked , her eyes finally were darkening with anger . " And you 're going to stop that ? " he said loudly . " You and five or six other murderous thugs ? " " We can try . Among other things that we will try . At least we 'll have the satisfaction of knowing that we tried . And what satisfaction will you have ? " She sneered at him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played tennis while it all was happening ? That there is n't a single human being alive who has any respect for you ? That you sat idly by while the men whose boots you lick morning , noon and night are plotting to blow up the world ? When everything goes up in the final explosion , are you going to be proud of yourself as you die because you ate well and drank well and fucked well while it all was being prepared ? Wake up ! Wake up ! There 's no law that says you have to be a worm . " " Rhetoric , " he said . " So what 'll you do  --  hijack an Israeli plane , break some windows in an embassy , shoot a policeman while he 's directing traffic ? Is that your idea of saving the world ? " " First of all , this has nothing to do with the Israelis . We  --  my group and I  --  have varying opinions on that subject , so do n't worry about your Jewish friends  --  my Jewish friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said sardonically , " for your German forbearance of the Jews . " " You bastard . " She tried to slap him across the table , but he was too fast for her and caught her hand . " None of that , " he said . " You may be wonderful with a machine gun , but you 're not a boxer , lady . Nobody 's going to get away with hitting me . You 've yelled at me and yelled at me and threatened me and asked me to do something that might get me killed or land me in prison for life and you have n't explained anything yet . " Recklessly , he went on , raving now . " If I 'm going to help you , it 's not going to be because you 're scaringme into it or bribing me or anything like that . I 'll make a deal with you . You 're right  --  there 's no law that says I have to be a worm . You convince me and I 'm with you . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threats to yourself and calmly explain . Otherwise , no soap . You understand that ? " " Let go of my hand , " she said sullenly . He dropped her hand . She stared at him furiously . Then she began to chuckle . " Hey , Billy boy , there 's something there after all . Who would have guessed that ? I think we need some fresh coffee . And you 're cold . Go in and get dressed and put on a sweater and we 'll have a nice little talk over the breakfast table about the wonder of being alive in the twentieth century . " In the bedroom , while he was getting dressed , he started shivering again . But even while he was shivering , he felt crazily exhilarated . For once he had n't backed down or slid away or evaded . And it could be a matter of life and death , he was sure of that . There was no sense in underestimatingMonika 's toughness or passion . The papers were full of stories of hijackings , bombings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and carried out by people who sat at the next desk from yours , who stood by your side in a bus , who went to bed with you , ate dinner with you . It was his tough luck that Monika was one of them . As she had said , he should have guessed something . Her insults had wounded him : it was one thing to know that you were worthless , it was another to be told by a woman whom you admired , more than that  --  much more  --  loved , who acted as though she loved you , that you had no value . The chuckle in the cold , dawn-lit kitchen had been a gift of respect and he accepted it gratefully . In Monika 's eyes now he was a worthy opponentand had to be treated accordingly . Until now he had let the 120 IRWIN SHAW world go its own way and had been satisfied to find a snug , government- issue corner for himself . Well , the world had caught up with him and he had to deal with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or not . From one moment to another , almost instinctively , he had put a new price on his existence . The hell with her , he thought , as he put on a sweater . Loss is the risk of breathing . The hell with all of them . Monika was heating a fresh pot of coffee when he went back into the kitchen . She had taken off her shoes and was padding around in her stockinged feet , her hair a dark mess , like any housewife newly risen from the marital bed to make breakfast for her husband on the way to the office . Terror in the kitchen , bloodshed over a hot stove , victims designated among the clatter of pots and pans . He sat down at the scarred wooden table , rescued from some Belgian farmhouse , and Mon- ika poured the coffee into his cup . Efficient German hausfrau . She made good coffee . He tasted it with relish . She poured some coffee for herself , smiled at him gently . The woman who had told him that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run a motor pool from which trucks could be obtained for deadly errands had disappeared . For the time being . For ten minutes on a cold morning , he thought , as he drank the scalding coffee . " Well , " he said , " where do we begin ? " He looked at his watch . " It ca n't take too long . I have to be at work soon . " " We begin at the beginning , " she said . " The state of the world . The world 's in a mess . The Fascists are everywhere . . . . " " In America . . . ? " he said . " Come on , Monika . " " In America it 's still disguised , " she said impatiently . " They can still afford to disguise it . But who gives them the arms , the money , the smoke screens , finally , the real support ? The fat cats in Washington , New York , Texas . If you 're going to insist on being naive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You sound as though it all comes out of a book . " " Why not ? " she said . " What 's wrong with learning from a book ? It would n't do you any harm to read a few books , either . If you 're so worried about your beloved native land , you 'll be relieved to hear that we 're not operating in America now , not the people I 'm with anyway , although I 'm not saying there are n't some who do . There 're bombs going off in America , too , and there 'll be more , I promise you . America 's at the base of the pyramid and in the end it will be the primeBeggarman , Thief 121target . And you 're going to be surprised how easily it will crumble in the end . Because the pyramid is shaky , it 's based on lies , immoral privileges , stolen wealth , subjugated populations ; it 's based on sand that 's hollow beneath the surface . " " You sound more like a book than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you just get it out of the library and I 'll read it myself . " Monika ignored his gibe . " What we have to do , " she went on , " is show that it 's vulnerable as well as evil . " " How do you plan to do that with a few crazy gangsters ? " " Do n't use that word , " she said warningly . " Whatever you want to call them . Gunmen . Assassins . Whatever . " " Castro did it in Cuba with eighteen men . " " America 's not Cuba , " he said . " And neither is Europe . " " They 're near enough . Both of them . The attacks will multiply . The men in power will get uneasy , uncertain , finally frightened . They 'll act out of fear , make one mistake after another , each one worse than the last . They 'll apply pressure . They 'll make disastrous concessions which will only make people realize that they were close to defeat and only inspire more incidents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said , " turn off the record , will you ? " " A bank president will be assassinated , " she chanted , rapt in her vision , " an ambassador kidnapped , a strike paralyze a country , money lose its value . They wo n't know where the next blow is coming from , just that there will be a next blow . The pressure will build up , until the whole thing explodes . It wo n't take armies . . . . Just a few dedicated people . . . " " Like you ? " he said . " Like me , " she said defiantly . " And if you succeed , then what ? " he said . " Russia takes the whole pot . Is that what you want ? " " Russia 's time will come , " she said . " Do n't think I 'm fool enough to want that . " " What do you want , then ? " " I want the world to stop being poisoned , stop being headed to extinction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the warriors we have now , the spies , the nuclear bombers , the bribed politicians , the killing for profit . . . . People are suffering and I want them to know who 's makingthem suffer and what they 're getting out of it . " " All right , " he said , " that 's all very admirable . But let 's speak practically . Supposing I get you the truck , supposing you put your hands on a122 IRWIN SHAWfew grenades , plastic , guns . Just what , specifically , are you going to do with them ? " " Specifically , " she said , " we are planning to blow in the windows of a bank here in Brussels , get some explosive inside the Spanish embassy , wipe out a judge in Germany who 's the biggest pig on the Continent . I ca n't tell you more than that . For your own sake . " " You 're ready to do a lot of things for my sake , are n't you ? " he said . He bowed sardonically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my colonelthanks you . " " Do n't be f ip , " she said coldly . " Do n't ever be flip with me again . " " You sound as though you 're ready to shoot me right now , dear little gunlady , " he said , mocking her , pushing himself to courage , although he was shivering again , sweater and all . " I 've never shot anybody , " she said . " And do n't propose to . That is not my job . And if your scruples are so delicate , perhaps you 'd like to hear that we plan to operate in such a way here in Belgium that nobody will get killed . What we do is merely unsettle , warn , symbolize . " " That 's Belgium , " he said . " What about other places ? " " That does n't concern you , " she said . " You do n't have to know anything about it . Later on , if you are convinced and you want to take a more active part , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the discussions . Right now , all you are to do is go to the bank and cash your uncle 's check and make a truck available for a few hours one night . Christ , " she said fiercely , " it 's nothing new to you , with your bribes  --  do n't think I do n't know how you live so high on a sergeant 's pay  --  with your black market gasoline . . . . " " My God , Monika , " he said , " do you mean to say you ca n't tell the difference between a little petty larceny and what you 're asking me to do ? " " Yes , " she said . " One is cheap and distasteful and the other is noble . You 've been leading your life in a trance . You do n't like what you are , you despise everybody around you , I 've heard you talk about your family , your mother , your father , your uncle , the animals you work with . . . Do n't deny it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he tried to speak . " You 've kept everything narrow , inside yourself . Nobody 's challengedyou to face yourself , open up , to see what it all means . Well , I 'm challenging you now . " " And hinting that something very nasty will happen to me if I do n't do as you want , " he said . " That 's the way it goes , laddy , " she said . " Think over what I 've just said as you work this morning . " " I 'll do just that . " He stood up . " I 've got to get to the office . " " I 'll be waiting for you at lunchtime , " she said . " I bet you will , " he said , as he went out the door . The morning in the office passed for him in a blur . As he checked out orders , requests , manifests , operation reports , he made dozens of decisions , each one over and over again , each one discarded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times he picked up the phone to call the Colonel , spill everything , ask him for advice , help , then put the phone down . He looked up the schedule of the planes flying out of Brusselsto New York , decided to go to the bank , cash his uncle 's check and get on a plane that morning . He could go to the CIA in Washington , explainhis predicament , get Monika put behind bars , be something of a secret hero in those secret corridors . Or would he ? Would those men , deft in murder and complicated underground maneuvers and the overthrowof governments , congratulate him and secretly , in their own style , scorn him for his cowardice ? Or even worse , turn him into a double agent , order him back to join whatever band Monika belonged to , tell him to report weekly on their doings ? Did he want Monika behind bars ? Even that morning , he could not honestly tell himself that he did n't love her . Love ? There was a word . Most women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copulation , to jump out of bed and go home . With Monika the night 's entwining could never be called copulation . It was absolute delight . To put it coarsely , he told himself , I can come five times a night with her and look forward eagerly to seeing her naked and rosy in bed at lunchtime . He did n't want to be killed . He knew that , just as he knew he did n't want to give up Monika . But there was something titillating , deeply exciting , about the thought that he was daring enough to make love to a woman , make her gasp in pleasure and pain , at six in the morning and know that she was ready to order his execution at noon . What would it be like to say to her , " I 'm with you " ? To slide in and out of shadows ? To hear an explosion somewhere nearby while he was playing tennis at the immaculate club with the Colonel and know that he had scheduled it ? To pass a bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bomb that would explode before the bank opened its doors in the morning ? To meet fanatics , who flitted from one country to another , who would be heroes in the history books , perhaps , a century from now , who killed with poison , with their bare hands , who could teach him their mysteries , who could make him forget he was only five feet six inches tall ? In the end , he did not call the Colonel , he did not cash the check , he made no arrangements at the motor pool , he did not go out to the air- port . What he did was drift , dazed , through the morning and when the Colonel called and said there was a game on at five-thirty that after- noon , he said , " Yes , sir , I 'll be there , " although he felt that there was a good chance he 'd be dead by then . She was waiting for him when he came out of the office . He was relieved that she had combed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lunch all looked at them speculatively , leers suppressed , mostly because of his rank , and he did n't like the idea of their thinking he consorted with a slob . " Well ? " she said . " Let 's have lunch , " he said . He took her to a good restaurant , where he knew the other men who wanted a change from the food in the Army mess were not likely to go . He wanted the reassurance of crisp tablecloths , flowers on the tables , at- tentive waiters , a place where there was no suggestion of the world tot- tering , desperate plotters , crumbling pyramids . He ordered for them both . She pretended not to be interested in what she ate and could n't bother with the menu . Meanly , knowing at least that much about her , he understood why she tossed the menu aside . She had to put on thick glasses to read and was vain enough not to wish to be seen in public with them on . But when the food came she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how she kept her figure . They ate quietly , talking politely about the weather , a conference that was to start tomorrow at which she was to act as translator , about his date for tennis with the Colonel at five-thirty , about a play that was coming to Brussels that she wanted to see . There was no reference to what had passed between them that morning until the coffee came . Then she said , " Well , what have you decided ? " " Nothing , " he said . Even in the overheated , cosy restaurant he felt cold again . " I sent the check back to my uncle this morning . " She smiled coldly . " That 's a decision , is n't it ? " " Partially , " he said . He was lying . The check was still in his wallet . He had n't known he was going to say it . It had come out mechanically , as though something had pushed a lever in his brain . But even as he said it , he knew he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , explaining to his uncle that his finances had taken a turn for the better and there was no need at the moment for help . It would prove useful later on when he really needed something from Uncle Rudolph . " All right , " she said calmly , " if you were afraid that the money could be traced , I understand . " She shrugged . " It 's not too important . We 'll find the money someplace else . But how about the truck ? " " I have n't done anything about it . " " You have all afternoon . " " No , I have n't made up my mind yet . " " We can handle that , too , I suppose , " she said . " All you have to do is look the other way . " " I 'm not going to do that , either , " he said . " I have a lot of thinking to do before I decide one way or another . If your friends want to kill me , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he saw their waiter approaching with more coffee , " tell them that I 'll be armed . " He had had one morning 's practice with a .45 , could take it apart and reassembleit , but had had a very low score when he had fired at a target for the record . Gunfight at the Brussels OK Corral , he thought . Who was it  --  John Wayne ? What would John Wayne have done today ? He giggled . " What 're you laughing about ? " she asked sharply . " I happened to think of a movie I once saw , " he said . " Yes , please , " she said in French to the waiter who was standing over her with the silver coffeepot . The waiter filled both their cups . After the waiter had left , she smiled at him strangely . " You do n't have to pack a gun . Nobody 's going to shoot you . You 're not worth a bullet . " " That 's nice to hear , " he said . " Does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I 'll make out a list , " he said , " and give it to you the next time we meet . If we meet . " " We 'll meet , " she said . " When are you moving out of the apartment ? " he asked . She looked at him in surprise . He could n't tell whether the surprise was real or feigned . " I had n't intended to move out . Do you want me to move out ? " " I do n't know , " he said . " But after today . . . " " For the time being , " she said , " let 's forget today . I like living with you . I 've found that politics has nothing to do with sex . Maybe with126 IRWIN SHAWother people , but not with me . I adore going to bed with you . I have n't had much luck in bed with other men . The orgasms are few and far betweenon the New Left  --  at least for me  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orgasms are a lady 's God-given right . You 're the answer to a maiden 's prayer for that , darling , if you do n't mind my being a little vulgar . At least for this particular maiden . And I like good dinners , which you are obliging enough to supply . So  --  " She lit a cigarette . She smoked incessantly and the ashtrays in the apartment were alwayspiled with butts . It irritated him , as he did not smoke and took seriously the warnings of the magazine articles about mortality rates for smokers . But , he supposed , you could n't expect a terrorist who was constantly on the lookout for the police or execution squads to worry about dying from cancer of the lungs at the age of sixty . " So  --  " she said , exhalingsmoke through her nostrils . " I 'll divide my life , while it lasts , into compartments . You for sex and lobster and pate de foie gras , and others for less serious occupations , like shooting German judges . Are n't you glad I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to pieces , he thought , little jagged pieces . " I 'm not glad about anything , " he said . " Do n't look so mournful , laddy , " she said . " Everybody to his or her own talents . And now , I have most of the afternoon off . Can you sneak away for an hour or two ? " " Yes . " He had long ago perfected a system of checking in and out of the office without being noticed . " Good . " She patted his hand . " Let 's go home and get into bed and have a perfectly delicious afternoon fuck . " Furious with himself for not being able to stand up , throw a bill on the table for the check and stalk out of the restaurant , he said , " I have to go back to the office for ten minutes . I 'll meet you home . " " I ca n't wait . " She smiled at him , her large blue eyes lighting up her Bavarian-Trinity face . CHAPTER . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IN THIS NOTEBOOK FOR SOME TIME .

K Sidney Altscheler was standing at the window of his office high up in the Time and Life Building , staring gloomily out at the lights of the buildings around the tower in which he worked . He was gloomy because he was thinking of all the editorial work ahead of him over the weekend . There was a discreet knock on the door and his secretary came in . " There 's somebody called Jordache here who wants to see you . " Altscheler frowned . " Jordache ? " he said . " I do n't know anybody named Jordache .

He was still at the window when there was a rap at the door and the secretary came in with a boy in a suit that was too small for him . " Come in , come in , " he said , and seated himself behind his desk . There was a chair next to the desk . He indicated it to the boy . " Will you need me ? " the secretary asked . " If I do , I 'll call you . " He looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , big for his age . Thin , handsome face , with disturbing intense eyes . Trained down like an athlete . " Now , Mr. Jordache , " he said briskly , " what can I do for you ? " The boy took out a page torn from Time . " You did this story about my father . " He had a deep , resounding voice . " Yes , I remember . " Altscheler hesitated . " Which one was your father ? The mayor ? " " No , " the boy said , " the one who was murdered . " " I see , " Altscheler said . He made his tone more kindly . " What 's your first name , young man ? " " Wesley . " " Have they found the murderer yet ? " " No . " Wesley hesitated . Then he said , " That is  --  technically no . " " I did n't think so . I have n't seen any follow-up . " " I really wanted to see whoever wrote the article , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the desk , but they telephoned around and found it was by a man named Hubbell and said he was still in France . So I bought a copy of Time and I saw your name up in front . " " I see , " Altscheler said . " What did you want to see Mr. Hubbell for ? Did you think the article was unfair or mistaken ? " " No . Nothing like that . " " Is there any new development you think we ought to know about ? " " No . I wanted to talk to Mr. Hubbell about my father and my father'sfamily . There was a lot about all that in the article . " " Yes . But Mr. Hubbell could n't help you . That was done here ; the material came from one of our researchers .

She came in imme- diately . " Miss Prentice , " he said , " will you find out who did the re- search on the Jordache article ? If I remember correctly it was Miss Larkin ; take the young man to her office . Tell her to do anything she can for Mr. Jordache . " He stood up . " I 'm afraid I have to go back to work now , " he said . " Thank you for coming to see me , Wesley . And good luck . " " Thank you , sir . " Wesley stood , too , and followed the secretary out of the office . Altscheler went back to the window and stared out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have done if his father had been murdered and he himself had been sure he knew who had done it . They did not consider these questions at Yale , where he had earned his B.A.The researcher had a little office without windows , lit by neon tubes . She was a small young woman with glasses , carelessly dressed , but pretty . She kept nodding and looking timidly at Wesley as Miss Prentice explained what he was there for . " Just wait a minute right here , Mr. Jordache , " she said , " and I 'll go into the files . You can read everything I dug up . " She flushed a little as she heard herself using the phrase . " Dug up " was not the sort of thing to say when you were talking to a boy whose father had been murdered . She wondered if she ought to cen- sor the files before she let the boy see them . She remembered very well working on the story  --  mostly because it was so different from anything she herself had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Riviera , in fact had never been out of America , but she had been a hun- gry reader in the literature courses she had taken in college and the south of France was firmly fixed in her imagination as a place of ro- mance and tragedy  --  Scott Fitzgerald driving to a party or from a party on the Grand Corniche , Dick Diver , desperate and gay on the blazing beaches , with all the trouble ahead of them all when everything col- lapsed . She had kept her notes , which she did n't usually do , out of a130 I R W I N SHAW Beggarman , Thief 131vague feeling of being connected to a literary geography that she would one day explore . She looked at the boy  --  who had been there , had suffered there , now standing in her office in his clumsy suit  --  and would have liked to question him , discover if he knew anything of all that . " Would you like a cup of coffee while you wait ? " she asked . " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Would you like a copy of this week 's magazine to look through ? " " I bought a copy downstairs , thank you . " " I 'll just be a minute , " she said brightly . Poor little boy , she thought as she went out of the office . So handsome , too . Even in the ridiculous suit . She was a romantic girl who had read a great deal of poetry , too . She could imagine him , dressed in flowing black , twin to the young Yeats in the early photographs . When she came back with the file the boy was sitting hunched over on the straight chair , his arms resting on his thighs , his hands hanging between his knees , like a football player on the bench . " Here 's everything , " she said brightly . She had debated with herself about whether or not to take out the photograph of Jean Jordache naked , but had decided against it . The picture had been in the magazine , after all , and he must have seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . " I have some work to do . " She gestured toward the pile of clippings on her desk . " But you wo n't bother me . " She was pleased to have him in the office . It broke the routine . Wesley looked down for a long time at the file without opening it , as Miss Larkin busied herself at her desk , using scissors and making notes , occasionally looking at the boy , until he caught her at it , which flustered her . Still , she thought , excusing herself , he 'd better get used to girls looking at him . They 're going to be doing it in droves . The first thing she saw him take out of the files was a photograph of his father in boxing trunks , with his fists cocked . He looked fierce and young . To Wesley , he hardly looked older than he himself was now . Every muscle stood out in his arms and torso . He must have scared the wits out of the guys he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture , too , when she took it out of the files . She thought the fighter looked like a handsome ruffian , somebodyit would be wise to stay away from . She preferred men who looked like intellectuals . She studied the boy frankly now , since he was paying attention only to the photograph in his hand . He looked surprisingly like his father , but there was nothing ruffianly about him . He must be atleast nineteen , she thought ; maybe it would be nice to invite him downstairsfor a drink . These days , she thought , nineteen can be very mature for a boy . She was only twenty-four herself ; you could n't call it an impossiblegap . The photograph had been cut out from Ring Magazine and there was a little article about Tom Jordan pasted to the bottom of the picture . " Tom Jordan , promising middleweight , undefeated in fourteen bouts , 8 k.o. ' s , on his way to London to fight Sammy Wales , contender for Britishmiddleweight championship , at Albert Hall . Arthur Schultz , Jordan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matches under his belt , Tommy will be ready for anybody in his division . " Clipped to the photograph , there was another sheet of paper with typingon it . Wesley started reading again . " Won fight in London by knockout . Fought Rene Badaud three weeks later in Paris . Knocked out in seventh round . From then on , record spotty , slipped down in class . Hired as sparring partner Freddy Quayles , Las Vegas , Nevada ( date ) .

A whole life in a few lines , all summed up in four words  --  " Has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Antibes , Wesleythought bitterly . He took out his pen and a piece of paper and wrote , Arthur Schultz , Freddy Quayles . Then he stared once more at the photograph of his father , the left hand out , the right hand up under the chin , the shoulders bunched , the fierce , confident young face , ready , according to authority , after four or five more matches , for anybody in his division . Not surfaced since . Wesley looked up at Miss Larkin . " I do n't think I 'd recognize him if he came in through the door right now looking like this . " He laughed a little . " I 'm glad he did n't believe in hitting kids , with those shoulders . " Miss Larkin saw that Wesley was proud of the hard body , the confident pugnacity of his father when he was just a bit older than the boy was now . " If you want the picture , " she said , " I 'll put it in a big envelope for you so you wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Wesley said . " I can really have it ? " 132 IRWIN SHAW " Of course . " " That 's really great , " Wesley said , " having the picture , I mean . I do n't have any picture of him . I had some , but they were all taken later . . . . He did n't look like this . He looked okay , " he said hastily , as though he did n't want Miss Larkin to think that he was running his fatherdown or that he had turned into a fat , bald , old man or anything like that . " He just looked different . The expression on his face , I guess . I do n't suppose you can go through life always looking about twenty years old . " " No , you ca n't , " Miss Larkin said . She searched for wrinkles around her eyes every morning . Wesley dug in the file and brought out a biographical note that Miss Larkin had prepared on the members of the family . Wesley went through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he did n't already know , his uncle 's early success and the scandal at the college , his aunt 's two marriages , the outlines of his father 's career . One line he read twice . " Rudolph Jordache , when he retired in his midthirties , was reputed to be a millionaire many times over . " Many times over . How many times would his father have had to fight , how many seasons on the Mediterranean would he have had to serve even to be a millionaire just one time over ? He looked curiously at the pretty girl with glasses working at her desk . Just by accident she had been chosen to learn so much about his family . He wondered what she would say if he asked what she really thought about the Jordaches . In her notes she had written that Rudolph'swas the standard American success story , poor boy makes good in a big way . Would she say of his father , poor boy makes bad in standardAmerican way ?

" He did n't want the nice young lady to think he was n't grateful . He gave her back the file and stood up . " Thank you very much . I better be pushing along now . " Miss Larkin stood up , too . She looked at him strangely , as though she was making up her mind about something . " I 'm just about finished here for the day , " she said . " I was wondering if you 'd like to go downstairs with me and have a drink ? " She sounded as though she was appealing to him , but he could n't tell for what . " I have a date later . . . " Even he could tell she was lying . " And I have an hour to kill . . . " Beggarman , Thief 133 " They wo n't serve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'm not eighteenyet . " " Oh , I see . " She flushed . " Well , thanks for the visit . If you ever come by again , now you know where my office is . If I can help in any way . . . " " Yes , ma'am , " he said . She watched him go out of the office , the big shoulders bulging in the tight jacket . Not yet eighteen , she thought . Boy , am I dumb . She sat staring at the papers on her desk for several minutes . She had a peculiar feeling that something strange was happening to her or was going to happen to her . She reread everything in the file . Murder , a rich brother , an intellectual sister , a brawling prizefighter done to death , the mystery unsolved . A beautiful son , still little more than a child , with strange , tragic eyes , looking for what  --  revenge ? The novel she was trying to write was about a girl very much like herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imaginative , her crushes on teachers , her first love , her first disillusionment with men , her coming to New York from a small town . She thought of it now with disdain . Writtena thousand times . Why was n't the boy 's story a novel ? After all , Dreiser had started An American Tragedy after reading an article in a newspaper . Nobody in Dreiser 's family had been murdered , he had n't known anybody who 'd been murdered , but he 'd written a great novel , just the same . Sitting in the same room with her just a few minutes ago was a handsome , complexboy , carrying the burden of remorse and sorrow on his shoulders almost visibly , nerving himself , she thought , shuddering deliciously , for the inevitable act . Hamlet as an American child . Why not ? Revenge was among the oldest of literary traditions . Turn the other cheek , the Bible said , but also an eye for an eye . Her father , who was a rabid Irishman , cursed whenever he read what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a portrait of Parnell in the living room when she was a child . Revenge was as much a part of all of us , she thought , as our bones and blood . We liked to pretend we were too civilized for it in the twentiethcentury , but the man in Vienna who spent his life tracking down Nazis who had killed Jews was honored all over the world . Her father said he was the last hero of World War Two . She wished she had had the sense to ask the boy where he could be found . She would have to find him , study him , bring him to life on the page , with all his anger , his doubts , his youthfulness . It was cold-134 IRWIN SHAWblooded , she told herself , but you either were a writer or you were n't . If he ever came into the office again , she would make sure that she 'd find out all about him .

She could hardly wait to get back to her apartment and throw the sixty pages she had written on her novel into the fire . CHAPTER 3Rudolph was sitting at the little upright piano , trying to pick out the melody of " On a Clear Day , " when he heard the bell ring and Mrs. Burtoncome out of the kitchen to answer it . He saw her pass in the hall on the way to the front door . She had her hat and coat on . She only came in during the day as she had to go home each evening to feed her own family in Harlem . From the kitchen he heard the laughter of Enid , who was having her supper with her nurse there . Rudolph was n't expecting anyone and he kept working on the melody . Getting the piano had turned out to be a good idea . He had originally bought it because the new nurse he had hired had a sweet voice and he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could play the piano a bit and he thought it would be useful for Enid to listen to someone actually making music in her own home . If it turned out that Enid had any talent it would be better for her than just hearing it from a box , as though Bach and Beethoven were as commonplace as an electric light , to be turned on or off by pushing a switch . But when the piano had been in the house for a few days he had found himself sitting down at it himself and foolingaround with chords , then melodies . He had a good ear and he could pass hours amusing himself and not thinking of anything but the music136 IRWIN SHAWat his fingertips . Whatever distracted him , even for a few minutes at a time , was so much profit . He had almost decided to take formal lessons . He heard Mrs. Burton come into the living room .

The neighbors , she complained , were careless about the front door and left it unlocked , so anyone could prowl the staircase . Rudolph stood up . " I 'll go see who it is , " he said . In the letter from Brussels the week before from Billy , Billy had n't said anything about coming to America . From the letters Billy had been writing him he seemed to have grown up into a nice , intelligent young man and on an impulse Rudolph had sent the thousand dollars Billy had asked for . Now he wondered if Billy had gotten into trouble with the army and deserted . That would explain the request for money . As for Wesley , there had been no word from him since Nice , and that was almost nine months ago . Mrs. Burton followed him down the hallway . Outside the partially opened door , across the chain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bulb . " It 's all right , Mrs. Burton , " Rudolph said . He slipped the chain free and opened the door . " Come in , Wesley . " He put out his hand . After the slightest of pauses Wesley shook it . " Will you be needing me any more tonight ? " Mrs. Burton asked . " No , thanks . " " Then I 'll be moving along home . Have a nice weekend , Mr. Jor-dache . " " Thanks , Mrs. Burton . " He closed the door behind her when she had left . Wesley merely stood there , his face thin , pale and expressionless , the ghost of his father as a boy , hostile and alert . He was in the same suit he had worn when he had left the jail in Grasse and it was smaller on him now than it had been then . He seemed to have grown and broadened considerably since their last meeting . His hair , Rudolph was happy to see , was not too long , but cropped at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Rudolph said as they went into the living room . " Can I get you something to drink ?

The nurse was a solid woman of about forty , with a marvelously gentle way of making Enid behave . " Your Cousin Wesley is here , Enid , " Rudolph said as he got a bottle of beer out of the refrigerator . He was about to tell her to come into the living room and say hello to Wesley after she had eaten , but thought better of it . He did n't know what Wesley had come for . If it was because of some emotional problem or dramatic adolescent disaster , it would only complicate matters to have Enid in the room . He kissed the top of her head and went into the living room with the beer and a glass . Wesley was standing awkwardly in the middle of the room just where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " Thank you , " Wesley said . " Are n't you having anything to drink ? " " I 'll have some wine with dinner . Sit down , sit down . " Wesley waitedfor Rudolph and then sat in a chair facing him . He drank thirstily . " Well , " Rudolph said , " how 're things ? What brings you to NewYork ? " " I went to the wrong address , " Wesley said . Rudolph noted that the boy did n't answer his question . " The doorman did n't want to tell me where you 'd moved to . He would n't believe I was your nephew . I had to show him my library card . " He sounded resentful , as though Rudolph had moved four blocks farther north just to avoid him . " Did n't you get the letter I sent you ? " Rudolph said . " I wrote you my new address the day I rented this apartment . " " I did n't get any letters . " Wesley shook his head . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even the one about how the estate would probably be finally settled and how much your share will be ? " " Nothing . " Wesley drank again . " What happens to your mail ?

" " I 'll tell you over dinner what was in the letter I sent you . " " I did n't hitchhike all the way from Indianapolis to talk about money , Uncle Rudy , " Wesley said softly . " It 's a  --  well , I guess you might say it 's a social visit . " " Does your mother know you 're here ? " 138 IRWIN SHAW Wesley shook his head .

" " They can come in handy , " Rudolph said , smiling . " At times . " Then more seriously , " Why did you have to hitchhike ? " " Money , " Wesley said . " Your mother gets quite a nice sum each month for your support for the time being , " Rudolph said . " There 's certainly enough for bus fare once a year to New York . " " Not a red cent , " Wesley said . " I 'm not complaining . I work after school . I get along . " " Do you ? " Rudolph said skeptically . Is that the only suit you have ? " " Like a whole suit  --  yeah .

" " Do n't make waves , please , Uncle Rudy , " Wesley said carefully , put- ting his glass down on the floor beside him . " There 's enough crap going on in that house without that . She says she 'll give me every cent of the money she 's supposed to if I go to church with her and Mr. Kraler , like a decent Christian .

" Her mother 's not in there with her . I wrote you we were divorced . " He shook his head annoyedly . " I do n't suppose you got that letter , either . " " Nope . " " Damn it . From now on I 'll write you care of General Delivery . Did n't you ever think it was queer that nobody wrote you ? " " I guess I never thought much about it . " " Did n't you write Bunny or Kate ?

" They 're fine . Kate 's had a baby . A boy . You 've got a brother . A half brother , anyway . " " Poor little bastard , " Wesley said , but the news seemed to cheer him . The blood survives , Rudolph thought . " When you write to Kate , " Wesleysaid , " tell her I 'll drop in on her in England someday . Kids .
