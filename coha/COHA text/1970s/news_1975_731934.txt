txt Eric Larrabee , executive director of the New York State Council on the Arts , has been told to resign by Governor Carey 's office . The resignation , as of June 1 , was requested by Thomas Lynch , deputy appointments officer , after consultation with Joan K. Davidson , the Governor 's new appointee as chairman of the state agency . The news came amid expressions of fear by some council members and staff members that the council might be made responsive to political pressures . Since its creation by Gov . Nelson A. Rockefeller in 1960 , the council has remained free of political interference . Some of the " politicization " fears wece apparently sparked by Mrs .. Davidson 's observations at a recent council meeting to the effect that Governor Carey wished to put his stamp on the agency after its 15 years under the Rockefeller-Wilson Administration . Mr. Larrabee , reached by telephone at his home in Buffalo last night , would not comment on his enforced resignation . But the news , while not entirely unexpected , distressed some council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a tough way for a man to get the news , " said Dorothy Rodgers , the author and wife of the composer Richard Rodgers , a council member for many years . " It seems to me there would have been kinder ways of letting him know . " Mrs. Roclgefs went on to praise Mr. Larrabee as " maybe not the best administrator , but a good spokesman for the council , and a hard and dedicated worker . He really cared about it . " Mrs. Davidson said last night , however , that Mr. Larrabee had been " told in the Governor 's office immediately after the election that this was likely to be the case " by David Burke , secretary to the Governor . " With Carey 's election , it was a fait accompli , " she said . " In the short time I worked with Eric I developed an enormous admiration and fondness for him . But I understand the need of a new administration to recast the council in line with its own ideas . " She added that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consideration for the job , although it would no longer carry the title of " executive director , " and would possibly sustain a salary reduction of $10,000 . Mr. Larrabee 's salary was $43,050 a year . Mrs. Davidson serves without pay as the council 's chairman . The salary cut , she said , was " our share in Governor Carey 's attempts to lower the administrativ , e costs of government . " And she noted that she had spent the last two days in Albany discussing rearrangement of the council 's structure " to The New York Times Eric Larrabee snake it work more efficiently . " Toward that end , she indicated , she wanted to abolish " unnecessary administrative layers . " " I 'd like to see that the peo ple who actually evaluate grant applications in the fields of music , dance , theater and so forth be given higher pay and more discretionary power , " Mrs. Davidson said . Mr. Larrabee , a member of ' , the council before he became its director in 1970 , had come under fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $34.1-million appropriation for 1974 to arts organizations throughout the state . An outspoken critic of what he called the " formula-funding " provisions of the appropriations bill , Mr. Larrabee had resisted the new legislative requirements that a list of " primary organizations " be drawn up to receive half of the appropriation , and that at least $13-million more . or a minimum of 75 cents for each resident of each of the state 's 62 counties , go to " per capita " funding . Bolstering the concern engendered by Mrs. Davidson 's remark that Governor Carey wanted to put his stamp on the agency is the fact that the terms of three Council members expired March 31. and six other members , appointed by Former Governor Wilson , hale not yet been confirmed by the Legislature . The Governor and his new Council chairman . a Democrat who was defeated her bid for State Senator last November , will thus have the say in filling nine of the seats on the 20-member council . " I would be concerned if this group of people became a political body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several years to run . She went on to note that the Rockefeller administration , though Republican , had net considered party affiliation when appointing Council members , and hoped the situation would continue . - " The delay in the new appointments has given rise to a mass of rumors , however , " she said . Yesterday Mrs. Davidson , who is on leave as vice president of her family 's foundation , the J. M. Kaplan Fund , said the vacant council positions should be filled with " people deeply committed to the arts and to the public interest . " " Governor Carey is searching for the best possible people for these positions from all over the state , " she said . " He may choose to keep some of Malcolm Wilson 's midnight appointees in office but has absolutely no obligation that I can see to do so . " Although Mrs. Davidson 's appointment has not yet been confirmed by the Senate , she has already assumed , as she said she would on its announcement , a strong executive role in the council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for one , that of abolishing the advisory panels that serve each of the council 's program areas , in theater , music , dance , etc. , have caused concern among council members and staff . Mrs. Davidson has also indicated to Howard Squadron , the council 's legal adviser for seven years , that he may be replaced in favor of another attorney who serves as her personal lawyer . Mr. Squadron says that , receiving no official notice of such a change , he will continue to serve the council . But Mrs. Davidson said Mr. Squadron has " a conflict of interest " in that he had some legal connections with grant recipients of the council . " Besides , it 's traditional that the head of an agency can choose the lawyer who represents it , " she said . Asked to comment yesterday on the council members ' concern about politicization , " Governor Carey said that the arts was " a field in which there are many people with definite ideas and convictions , but out of that should come harmony and common sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become the case . " , A spokesman added that the Governor had " full confidence " in Mts . Davidson .
