txt Chicago 1 Ohm Press Service WASHINGTON  --  Richard M. Nixon said for $600,000 Wednesday what he would n't say as President : " I let down my friends . I let down the country . . . let the American people down , and I have to carry that burden with me for the rest of my life . " Thud the former President unburdened his soul in a fascinating television interview with David Frost , ' who seemed startled into silence when Nixon said that by his resignation " I have impeached myself . " " I brought myself down , " Nixon said . " I gave ' em the sword . And they struck it in , and they twisted it with relish . " And I guess if I 'd been in their postlion , I 'd a done the same thing .
