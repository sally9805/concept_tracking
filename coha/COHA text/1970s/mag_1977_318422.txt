THE COOKIES <P> Directed and Written by JOEL SERIA <P> Pont-Aven , the setting for much of this loosely structured , deliberately vulgar French comedy , is the seacoast town where Paul Gauguin settled temporarily after abandoning his job and family in the 1880s . The hero of The Cookies is a present-day painter who also throws over a boring wife and job and moves to Pont-Aven . One major difference between the two men , however , is that Gauguin became in his rebellion a leading light of the French avantgarde . The hero of Cookies , both as a man and a painter , is largely obsessed with female buttocks . He is an artist , one might say , of the derriere-garde . <P> Considering the kind of crude , exuberant fun that might have been had from such a subject , Cookies , when it is n't forced , is curiously listless . Jean-Pierre Marielle plays the painter well . A few scenes come briefly to life : the manageress of an umbrella shop coyly allowing herself to be seduced ; the repressed sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he undresses for the night ; a prostitute , before taking on a customer , matter-of-factly washing his genitals in the sink along with the dishes . But Joel Seria is the kind of literal-minded director who , when a character has to leave his car , cross a road , cut along a field and knock on the door of a house , follows him with the camera every tedious step of the way . The painter may want to be behind his subjects , but the film as a whole makes the mistake of lagging far behind the viewer 's imagination .
