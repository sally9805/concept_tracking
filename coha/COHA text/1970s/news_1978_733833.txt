txt Despite early pessimism , a feeling is growing that Jordan 's King Hussein now is shifting to a more positive attitude to ward the Camp David accords . This development is of critical importance to a Mideast peace settlement , for Jordan plays a key role in the discussions about the Israeli-occupied Jordan West Bank . So far King Hussein has taken a negative stand toward the Camp David suggestions that he become involved in the negotiations . Yet on at least two counts , King Hussein has given United States Secretary of State Cyrus Vance some encouragement that the Jordanian leader might eventually be drawn into the negotiating process . King Hussein has , for instance , firmly resisted the efforts of such Arab hard-liners as Libya 's Col. Muammar al-Qaddafi and Palestine Liberation Organization ( PLO ) leader Yasser Arafat that he should be persuaded to join the anti-Sadat , anti-Camp David Arab forces . The second heartening sign to Mr. Vance was an indication from King Hussein that he would not rule out the possibility of joining the peace moves on the basis of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a public Israeli pledge to meet King Hussein 's key negotiating demands , U.S. officials had said , was the only hope for turning the Camp David agreements into the basis for a comprehensive peace . " There is no way we are going to get Israel to commit itself to Hussein 's demands they pull out of all occupied lands and endorse self-determination of the Palestinians . " confided one U.S. diplomatic source . // From page 1 Behind Jordan 's tough talk a ray of hope " What we need is to convince the key Arab leaders ? particularly King Hussein ? to have faith in the negotiating process , or perhaps faith just in us , as a path toward these goals . " King Hussein was asked at the news conference whether American assurances on withdrawal and Palestinian rights might be enough to bring him into the current peace process or whether Jordan needed a public commitment from Israel . " My main concern now , " King Hussein replied , " is the U.S. position on all these issues . " Senior Jordanian sources believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stressed that U.S. guarantees would have to be clear and address Jordan 's specific misgivings about the agreements . But Mr. Vance 's immediate goal was to make sure King Hussein had not lost all faith in Washington , which after all did not once contact the King during the drafting of a " peace framework " that mentioned his nation 17 times . ( Egypt 's President Sadat did contact him , however . ) Hussein 's care not to close the door on a settlement based on U.S. guarantees rather than much more difficult Israeli commitments indicated Mr. Vance got at least something that he wanted . The reconciliation visit by Messrs . Arafat and Qaddafi , too , might not have been exactly as it seemed . First , the hard-liners were not pressing King Hussein to join the " steadfastness front " in outright opposition of Camp Da- 1 , vid . They simply wanted to make sure the hard-liners ' own internal differences did not push Hussein into Washington 's orbit by default .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
