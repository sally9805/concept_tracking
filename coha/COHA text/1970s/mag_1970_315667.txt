IS there such a thing as black art ? Museums and gallery owners across the country seem to think so , and are rushing to mount shows . But as in other such efforts , earnest , liberal Whitey does not seem to have got it just right . <P> Some angry young black artists consciously paint black . Others of the generation that came of artistic age during the time of the new black militancy are painting and sculpting in styles ranging from expressionist to minimal , and they resist being classified racially . All these artists generally resent white sponsorship , even while recognizing that they have to deal with the white Establishment . As black men , they must approve the new recognition won by black artists . But as artists , they dislike the white man 's current celebration of them merely because they are black . As one artist put it : " The black artist is a man , baby , not some kind of plastic superman you can make tap dance to Whitey 's tune . " Said another scornfully : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canvas , paint it black , call it Nigger Number One , and they 'll eat it up . " <P> Young and Angry . The youngest and angriest care neither about what Whitey thinks nor about what they call the " white man 's aesthetic . " Their sole interest is to create a black art to which the black community can respond . <P> A good example is Boston 's Dana Chandler Jr. , a product of the tough Roxbury ghetto . At 28 he is a painter whom few in Boston can ignore , since his huge , bright Black Power murals glare from the sides of buildings that people pass by every day . Chandler 's avowed intent is to " create a black museum in the inner city . " His scorn for the white art world is complete . " Frank Stella ? So much crap ! It 's decorative and costs lots of money and does n't say anything . Earthworks ? What the hell does it mean to black people if you get bulldozers and dig holes in the ground ? All this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about where the white community is at , namely , nowhere . " His easel works are as bold and simple as his walls . In The Golden Prison , he shows a black man behind bars beneath a flag with yellow and red stripes . " Why yellow ? That 's because America has been yellow and cowardly in dealing with the black man . " In Freddie Hampton 's Door , a rendition of the Panther leader 's bullet-splintered door bears a stamp of U.S. Government approval . <P> Into the Street . Some 20 other muralists , with encouragement and materials supplied by the city of Boston , have splashed their pride and sometimes anger on public walls . They are not subtle , nor are they meant to be . Among the most skilled is Charles Milles ' mural painted on a handball wall in Orchard Park , in the primarily black Roxbury neighborhood . It proudly depicts black aspirations in dance , theater and music-and brings a spot of color to an otherwise dismal plavground.            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
