txt " Calm has been restored to Brownsville , " said Mayor Lindsay yesterday after touring this terribly deprived section of New York City that was still smoldering from the disturbances of the day before . Can that calm be maintained ? Tinder for more massive trouble clearly exists . It exists in the form of dry statistics , the accountant 's digits that so impersonally tell of antipoverty programs cut and assistance to the urban needy denied , the crisp dollar signs that bracket the shriveled figures on the pages of this year 's state budget . This is a bad budget . It is an antiurban budget . It is a budget that hits hardest at the least affluent members of society . For all the indignities and hardships that this budget will force on them , the disadvantaged have little means of protest . As the rioting in Brownsville so vividly indicates , any demonstration against this budget is bound to be emotion-charged . A mere demonstration carries the inherent risk of serious disorder . The less responsible elements in any community are , apt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for violence . This , essentially , seems to be what happened in Brownsville . Abandoned buildings were burned . Stores were looted . Mayor Lindsay has properly commended members of the city 's Police and Fire Departments for their courageous actions in minimizing personal injuries and property damage . He has also properly condemned the " outrageous acts of wanton destruction . " These acts serve neither the interests of the city nor the city 's poor . They may only steel the resolve of the more recalcitrant members of the State Legislature not to amend a budget which desperately needs amending . Cuts that the State Legislature effected in Governor Rockefeller 's proposed budget will cost the City of New York no less than $60 million in anticipated revenues . Each of these revenue cuts represents a promise broken : the state revenue-sharing formula was scaled down ; the city was denied a share of motor-vehicle and fuel taxes ; it will not receive a portion of state lottery receipts . In addition to this direct loss of revenues , sharp cuts have come both in benefits paid the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a 10 per cent cut in welfare assistance levels , a cut which actually comes to 25 per cent when overdue cost-of-living increases are taken into account . To cut the budget for a family of four by $23 is to cut the equivalent of six days ' food . Many of the residents of Brownsville are on welfare . They received their first reduced assistance checks several days ago . Cuts in Medicaid may force additional poor onto welfare rolls . Health care cuts could , according to city officials , force the closing of some city hospitals . A $12-million cut in state funds for the City University , coupled with other fiscal problems , could force an end to open enrollment , an elimination of the freshman class and even , according to school spokesmen , the closingdown of the entire university . To end open enrollment is to confine many of the poor to lives of privation and to close opportunity 's door just after it had been swung wide . The list of budgetary cuts in programs vital to the poor goes on . Cuts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than $14 million , will probably cause the scuttling of programs offering basic education to relief recipients . These cuts will also injure or eradicate programs to strengthen the racial balancing of schools by providing teacher aids to bring along the slower pupils . A $30-million cut in narcotics assistance almost equals the city 's entire current expenditures in this area , according to some officials . A $3-million cut in the rent-control budget , wholly funded by the state , risks undermining the administration of the new rent-control law . A $2-million cut in health and housing code enforcement programs may end the city 's rat-control program while seriously hobbling enforcement of the housing code to compel landlords to improve property in exchange for any rent increases allowed . Responsible public officials and interested community leaders have an obligation to help keep Brownsville calm , to help damp down the self-destructiveness of the hotheads . The State Legislature , however , has an obligation to avoid the sort of budgetary violence that has been one cause of the demonstrations . It is not too late , even now , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adequately provides for the cities of this state .
