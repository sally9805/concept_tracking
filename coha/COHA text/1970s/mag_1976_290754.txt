How is it that a man who earns $135,000 a year after taxes can save al most nothing and has , with his wife , only $1,239 in the bank ? That question was put to President Ford at last week 's press conference , after he had disclosed his financial status . <P> Ford is paying all or most of the expenses of his four grown children and footing the bill for the education of three of them ( Susan , Steve and Mike ) . Be sides , for each one he buys a $50 Government bond and puts $100 into a mutual fund every month . Press Secretary Ron Nessen had further explanations : <P> Betty Ford buys her clothes out of the President 's pay , and the Fords ' person al expenses for food ( about $800 a month ) and entertainment of private guests ( including overtime paid to White House servants ) also come out of his $1 1,250-per-month income . The same is true of vacations and insurance , taxes and upkeep on the Fords ' 1971 Mus tang , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vail , Colo. , and Grand Rapids - all of which add up to an eminently comfortable lifestyle . <P> So this week , when Ford collects his Government-green monthly checks , marked with his Social Security number ( 372-28-6832 ) , he may reflect , al most like anybody else , about the difficulties of saving and the pangs of inflation - fortunately diminishing .
