The governments attention to the poor has went from benine concern to malignant neglect . <P> This example of writing wrongs by a Michigan State University student appears in the current issue of the school 's alumni magazine . Last fall about 11% of M.S.U. 's 7,700 freshmen were required to take a remedial course in English . Says English Instructor Mary Davis : " Even though they can talk to you as sophisticated and aware 18-year-olds , their voice on paper is that of a ten-year-old . " <P> The same problem exists at scores of other colleges . Cornell , Stanford and Wisconsin have established special writing-improvement centers that students attend voluntarily . At Yale , for the first time since the late 1950s , " bonehead English " ( basic composition ) is being taught freshmen lacking the most rudimentary skills . <P> No wonder , then , that colleges are looking forward to some help in evaluating the writing skills of freshmen before they arrive on campus . The College Entrance Examination Board ( C.E.E.B. ) has decided to add to its college-admissions testing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In experimental use for three years , this exam will now become a separate but permanent adjunct of the Scholastic Aptitude Test ( SAT ) that is taken by roughly 1.4 million students each year . Further , the board will reinstitute a 20-minute essay section in the present English Composition Achievement Test , one of 15 exercises taken annually by some 300,000 college applicants seeking course placement . The essay option , which was dropped in 1971 because of the relatively high costs of grading it , will return in December next year . Colleges can only hope that both C.E.E.B. actions will , to quote from another M.S.U. student 's paper , " ease there pain . "
