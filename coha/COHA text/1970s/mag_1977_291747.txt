On the morning after the looting orgy , the Spanish-language newspaper El Diario front-paged in huge type the question that was on nearly every New Yorker 's mind : POR QU ? ( Why ? ) . <P> What had sparked the plunder ? <P> What had changed since that placid blackout night of 1965 ? Doubtless the heat and humidity made some difference ; in 1965 the power failed on a pleasantly cool evening in November . But much more had changed in a dozen years . Respect for law and authority has declined ; thieves often go unpunished ; crime and violence stalk the slums . So , of course , does poverty . Unemployment among young ghetto blacks is as high as 40% , v. more than 20% in 1965 . <P> Close to half of American black families have advanced to the middle class , but their rise has only increased the frustration of an underclass that sees no way up . Says Harvard Social Psychologist Robert Bales : " When economic conditions get better , those who are left behind get angrier . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show everybody enjoying a cornucopia of consumer goods-as if everybody should have them as a natural right . They feel no stake in a society that seems to deny them the opportunity to acquire those goods . Northwestern Political Scientist Ted Gurr , co-author of the 1969 Eisenhower Commission report on violence in America , argues that " the poor , and especially poor blacks , do n't share our middle-class values for other people 's property . The goods were there for the taking . " <P> Many black and Hispanic leaders read in the looting a message to the nation . Says Educator Kenneth Clark : " We have reduced the people of the ghetto to the point where they function on the level of predatory animals . " Adds U.N . Ambassador Andrew Young : " If you turn the lights out , folks will steal . They 'll do that especially if they 're hungry . " That went a bit far-even in the ghetto , few Americans do not have enough to eat . <P> Psychologist Morton Bard of the Graduate Center of New York 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thing-steal from the rich and give to the poor . " But the explanation that leans on real and perceived deprivation goes only so far . It is by no means clear that most of the looters were the neediest . There was an element of glee , perhaps of revenge , of a mob gone wild . Says Bard : " The looting had a quality of madness . I can not believe that they cleaned out a store of prayer shawls and Bibles . " Adds Ernest Dichter , a noted behavioral psychologist : " It was just like Lord of the Flies . People resort to savage behavior when the brakes of civilization fail . " <P> Harvard Social Psychologist Thomas Pettigrew was impressed by the lack of ideology in the looting-a striking contrast to the 1960s riots . Says he : " When the lights went out , there was a free-for-all , an individualistic phenomenon in which everyone gets what he or she can get . " Declared Futurist Herman Kahn , director of the Hudson Institute : " They have no idea of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is crap . This kind of reasoning will make the same thing happen all over again . "
