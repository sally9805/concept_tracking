txt The new Congress is producing its own kind of congressional leader ? and the new look probably suits the prospective new President just fine . The election of new leaders of both parties in the Senate and a new Democratic leader in the House of Representatives  --  the most sweeping change-of-command in recent years ? elevates three men who are moderately conservative from the Southern half of the country , and Democrats who are relatively unknown technicians . The men ? and the Capitol Hill tradition ? they replace were liberals from the North , and nationally known party spokesmen . The change could not be more potentially advantageous for President-Elect Jimmy Carter if he had arranged it himself ( and there is no evidence he even tried ) . Instead of competing with him for headlines and pushing their own programs , the new Senate and House majority leaders are expected to shun the limelight and concentrate on enacting the Carter legislative program .

Senate majority leader Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia and House majority leader James C.

Humphrey cited a desire for " efficiency , " " parliamentary expertise , " and " getting things done . " Their Republican colleagues , however , made an opposite choice , picking Howard H. Baker Jr . of Tennessee , keynote speaker at last summer 's GOP convention and vice-chairman of the special Watergate investigating committee , over veteran assistant leader Robert P. Griffin of Michigan . Some Republican senators were known to prefer a more forceful , nationally known figure to help fill the leadership gap left by the absence of a GOP president for the first time in eight years . " Quite a few people feel Bob Griffin is not a national spokesman , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leader 's post himself . The Senate , despite its heavily liberal coloration , comes under the leadership of relative conservatives for the first time in at least 22 years , since Lyndon B. Johnson became majority leader in 1955.
