 | Now , years later , he felt as if his muscles were finally turning to worms , his lungs to leaves and his bones to petrified stone . Suddenly the monstrous dread of dying seized his mind , his brain itched , and he trembled like a naked child in the snow . No ! he shouted . It ca n't happen , it wo n't happen ! As long as I breathe , it wo n't happen ... . In silence the old man listened carefully for the song of life . Curled in the darkness somewhere beyond the house , it beckoned with the faint , soft sound of a flute . Then it was gone .  | TWO He would leave at once . He considered strapping on his buckler but decided it would be more of a nuisance than a help . Besides , he could barely lift the sword . What would he do with the buckler ? Maybe he should leave them both . But why worry now ? These were details he could take care of in Peru . Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he thought , looking at the hairless face in the mirror . You 're more indio than a Tarahumara , his wife used to say . He wiped his face dry , wet it with cologne , then trimmed his sideburns with the cuticle scissors . The face hung in the mirror a moment longer . He gathered his clothes in the bedroom . The drapes were open , the shade up , as Carmela had left them . Quickly he put his arms into the smoking jacket , worn to the lining at the elbows , adjusted his ascot and pulled on an uncreased pair of khaki trousers . As he hurried toward the stairs , his slippers slapped against his bare heels . He could hardly wait . Should he send a message to the viceroy ? Surely news of his coming would bolster morale of the Cuzco garrison . Cuzco , Navel of the World , the very soul of Inca greatness and power . Cuzco . Again he tasted the word and steadied himself on the banister . Perhaps he should make the climb by land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this way he could inspect the terrain . Yes , by land , perhaps on the bus . He was never the best of horsemen . Excitement rose in his throat , and suddenly his fingers had sunk into the carpet . In the kitchen the mute parakeet cracked a seed and almost spoke . And from outside the house came the shrill , metallic mound of freight car wheels rolling into the yard .  | Fausto rushed through Lima and headed into the mountains onthe first bus out . He hardly glimpsed the city , except for the smog , or the drizzle , he was n't certain . Now and then he saw a church , a plaza , the face of food in the window , but most of the time he slept , hoping he could endure the dusty , jarring ride into the sierra . Arriving in Huancayo , he quickly smoked his last American cigarette . Desperate , he searched the streets , approaching vendors , entering stores , combing the open market . Nothing . Finally the black market emerged in the form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Although Fausto 's Spanish was n't the best , he noticed the man 's speech was ungrammatical but to the point . The stranger led him through a low doorway into a cavelike room . Along the whitewashed walls dark figures , mostly hunched over tables , hardly noticed him . The air reeked of stale grease and warm chicha . Fausto waited in the outdoor courtyard while the man climbed a stairway and disappeared in a room above the restaurant . The stranger returned with his sale wrapped in brown paper , received his money with a grin and left . Fausto ripped off the paper ; one pack was missing . His first setback . Before leaving Huancayo he composed an elegant , detailed report to the viceroy . Numerous violations of trade and customs regulations by well-organized native elements ... bound to undermine authority . Then a few hints on the leader 's whereabouts . Fausto made no mention of punishment ; the thought of blood sickened him . On the way to Cuzco he suffered an attack of diarrhea , almost forcing him to halt the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubling over and clenching his fists . Once he begged the driver to stop . The narrow , shoulderless road clung to the rock above a twothousand-foot drop into the Apurimac River . The driver refused , ordering his passenger to wait a while longer . But Fausto 's patience had been drained miles back . He persisted , almost in tears . Meanwhile the other passengers craned their necks to catch the outcome of the argument . " Stop ! " " No ! " " Stop or I 'll report you to the authorities . " " Only God can stop this bus . " " And the archbishop ... ? " The driver halted the bus and opened the door . " One minute . "  | " Two ! " " One . . . I 'm counting . " Fausto carefully set his feet on the ground , dropped his trousers and squatted . Between his legs he could see the gleaming thread of river far below . As he hobbled back to his seat in the middle of the bus , several passengers smiled sympathetically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they approached Cuzco , and Fausto leaned over his neighbor 's armrest for a glimpse . No , it was n't like the Valley of Mexico . Tenochtitlan was finer , somehow grander . Cuzco seemed a gray , hillside mass of stone . But below the city , along the highway , he could see the green fields , young with corn , wheat , barley and potato plants . Indian families squatted in doorways , watching the bus jog by in swirls of dust . This time Fausto ignored the driver 's refusal to stop and simply descended from the machine of noise , odors of urine and grimy bodies . After the dust settled , he breathed deeply and marched ahead . Leaving the road , he struggled to push away annoying reminders of time . Telephone poles along the train tracks refused to vanish , a billboard advertising Cuzquena beer remained in the distance . But Fausto was determined to enter the city grandly , mounted , leading an army of foot soldiers , arquebusiers and lancers . In a loud voice he ordered the right flank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the corn , he shouted . And do n't harm anyone ! It has to be a peaceful entrance . Behind a cluster of huts several farmers clutched their children and ran into their homes . Chickens scattered and dogs curled their tails at the sound of pounding hooves . But as the commander approached the new airport on the south side of the city , he winced . He should be on the north side . What did the map say . . . ? He had left it on the bus . The thin air had tired him , and Fausto began to breathe harder , turning his face to the rich , cloudless sky . Dizzy , he reluctantly ordered the army to continue without him . Then he crossed the concrete runway , slowly passed through the new terminal building and called for a taxi . A good hotel , he told the driver . A clean one .  | After his nap , Fausto relaxed between the starched sheets . He admired the strong , wooden ceiling beams , the burnished tile floor , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touched the smooth , white walls , the dark , hand-carved. crucifix . Months of labor , of fine Iberian skill . His reverie took him to the balcony where he flung open the latticed shutters . Below him in the empty plaza a dreamy-eyed llama glanced at the odd figure in pajamas . Later two Indian boys helped him bathe . Then they trimmed his hair , fingernails and toenails . Finally they dressed him . The silky swish of his lace cuffs reminded him of Carmela 's best mantilla . It seemed nothing had been spared the viceroy 's hospitality . Perfumed and powdered , Fausto left for the noon meal . He asked for two poached eggs , a dish of cottage cheese , a veal steak and three choices of ice cream . " And waiter , " Fausto added , " tell his excellency I 'm most grateful for his attention . " " The best is yet to come , " the young man said with a wink . " What 's that ? " " I ca n't tell you . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anxiety grew . What would happen to him ? Was he being fattened like a hog before slaughter ? Worse , how could he explain his mission to the viceroy if he himself did n't know ? A man at arms ? Fausto laughed nervously and pushed away the steak . He had no army , no weapons . Who would believe him ? On the other hand . . . he might be a pilgrim . . . But where was he going ? What shrine ? Maybe a courtier ? A merchant ? An emissary from Panama ? No , none of these would do . But the truth was even flimsier . Fausto abruptly left the table and hurried toward the elevator . He was afraid this might happen . A man just does n't wander about without a purpose . In his room Carmela was waiting for him . At first her beauty left him speechless . She sat on the edge of the bed with her back to the afternoon light , her long black hair spread over her shoulders . " Mijita , " Fausto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought you were at work . " " I am . I was told to come . " " I do n't understand . . . You do n't work here . " " Listen , let 's get started . It 's much more fun than talking . Or have you forgotten how ? "  | Fausto blushed . " Carmela ! " " My name 's not Carmela . It 's Ana . " " But you 're my niece . " " I never saw you before . But I suppose I could be Carmela ... for a while . " Fausto palmed his thinning hair and shook his head . " You do n't want to do this , do you ? " Ana said flatly . " I do n't think so , I 've got a headache . " " I 'll take it away , let me try . " " No , I 'm tired . " Ana kicked off her sandals , unbuttoned her blouse and began to pull her arms out the sleeves . " I just want to lie down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor . " If you want , you can rub my temples . " " Alright , old man , lie down . I 'll rub your temples . " She placed his head between her legs , looked at the ceiling and sighed . Under the steady pressure of her hands , Fausto soon fell asleep . When he woke , Ana was sitting next to him on the wooden seat of a train . Fausto squinted at the sudden light . Through the window he could see a herd of dairy cows in the shade of a lone eucalyptus tree . " What 's this ? " he asked . " A train . " " I mean , where am I ? Where are we going ? " " You do n't belong in Cuzco , I could see that . You even said so in your sleep . The trip should n't take too long , and I think you 'll like it . " " Is this the viceroy 's idea ? " " No , it 's mine . I 'm taking you where few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " There , beyond the clouds . " In the distance above a few scattered clouds , Fausto could see the giant white peak . He turned to Ana , and she patted his hand as if to ease his fear . She wore many skirts , a rough cotton blouse , and the tire soles of her sandals were worn and curved up at the edge . The narrow-gauge train wound its way down through the gorge of the Urubamba River . From Cuzco the trip had been a descent of some eight thousand feet , from the sparse grasses of the altiplano to the warm , humid lushness of the Amazon 's edge . A matter of minutes at one point , and the little train entered the tropics . Fountains of  | tangled vines and broad , lustrous leaves pushed from both sides . Life strained from every rock . Passing quickly beneath Macchu Picchu , Fausto gazed at the rock-hewn terraces and for a moment forgot the arthritic jabs in his limbs . They left the train at a stop where the gorge widens to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helped him to the ground and they started up a narrow valley to the west . Fausto fought exhaustion most of the afternoon . The huge greenness of nature squeezed itself upon the trail , and it was all he could do to keep his legs moving . After several hours of trudging behind Ana , he began to regret leaving home . He longed for his armchair , his bed , his dinner by the kitchen radio , his books and the quiet company of his parakeet . " Stop , Ana . " " Again ? " " A few minutes . . . I 'll be fine . " " Maybe we should n't have come . " " I started this , I 'll finish it , " Fausto said , trying to sound firm . After a short rest , the march continued . Several times he tripped and cursed his luck . The trail seemed to vanish , and he no longer could see Ana . The jungle heat tightened around his neck and chest . The air turned dark , and he glimpsed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He would charge the intruder . If it were death , he would impale the monster to the hilt . But with what ? Fausto asked feebly . He waved his arms weakly at the silhouette , crashed into a tree and toppled over . Ana discovered him tangled in thick cords of vines , on his back and unable to free himself . " I thought I had lost you , " she said , cutting him loose with her machete . " I must have fainted , " Fausto said , relieved at the touch of her hands . " Not far from here is a spring . You can rest there . " They followed the trail for a short distance , then Ana skipped ahead toward the sound of water . When Fausto arrived , he saw her playfully splashing her feet between two puma heads that spouted small , clear streams into a rock-carved basin . A mild breeze blew flower petals over her glistening body . She gestured with a nod toward the water . Fausto hesitated , then approached , and she gently removed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and massaged his back and shoulders . Afterward he slept in the shade of a mango tree on tiny ferns and tender blades of grass . She kept the insects away with a young palm branch , occasionally soothing his temples . When he woke , she was sitting beside him , wild lucma fruit in her lap . She rubbed his knees a while longer , then brought him water to drink . Now they would begin the steepest climb , several hours ' journey to the barren uplands above the valley . On the way they passed through a cloud-forest of weird , roottwisted shrubs and moist , darkened hollows surrounded by spongy earth . The gnarled branches of these stunted , phantom trees seemed to reach out and block the trail . Ana explained that many travelers had been trapped here and they lived on as insects , bats , even rocks . " Do n't worry , " she said . " We 'll be out soon . " Fausto hobbled after her and as they emerged into the fading light of nightfall , he saw the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Human figures , alpacas and sheep moved beneath the glacier basins . Ana begged him to stay on his feet . " We must hurry , something has happened . . . I can feel it . " " I ca n't , you go on ahead . " " Please , papacito . It 's not far . " " I ca n't . . . " " You must ! " When the sky darkened , Ana cried out . Fausto swayed , leaned against her , and the two fell . She left him and ran to catch the long procession of torchlights winding up the mountain toward the snow . Gasping , he clutched the knot of fire in his chest and struggled forward . Again and again he called out . Once a child , lingering behind the procession , turned and beckoned with his hand . For a long while Fausto would fall , catch his breath , then stagger on in dizzying bursts of will . Eventually he crawled onto the hard snow , saw the group in the distance and pulled himself closer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whiteness , their ponchos whirling in one great circle around the women who kneeled in the center , sending their wails to the rocky crags above . On hands and knees Fausto moved into the circle and reached the crude platform where Ana helped him to lie down . Around them , the  | mourners tore the air with shouts and beat the ground . Fausto was too tired to refuse their grief . They mean well ... but why me ? " Ana ? " Fausto whispered . " It 's Carmela . " " Yes , Carmela .... Do n't go . " " I 'm right here , " she said and wiped his forehead . Far away an unknown shepherd raised his flute and released a long , melancholy note , then another , and another . Fausto smiled . " Hear that , mijita ? " " Yes , Tio . " " It 's beautiful .... I ca n't think of anything more beautiful . "  | Tio , dinner 's ready ! " Fausto did not answer . Carmela rapped her fingertips on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stairs , called again , then entered the darkened room on tiptoes . The blankets were bunched on one side of the bed . " Tio , " she whispered , " where are you ? " She turned on the night table lamp and examined the bed . " Wake up , " she pleaded . Fausto lay on the far edge of the bed , his small head covered by the rumpled sheet . Carmela felt the form and pulled back the blankets . Fausto did not move . She shook his limp hand , and his eyebrow moved slightly . " Tio , why are you playing dead ? " After a moment , Fausto opened his eyes . " I 'm hungry , " he said in a tired voice . " You scared me . You were n't asleep , were you ? " " No , mijita . I thought I was dead . " Fausto sat up . " It happens , you know . From one day to the next , poof ! Al otro mundo . " " Well , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything ready . " She handed him his Japanese kimono and helped him with his slippers . " Did it snow ? " Fausto asked after they were seated at the table . Carmela laughed . " Here ? In Los Angeles ? " He gouged into the melon slice with his spoon . " Yes , here . " " No , Tio , it did n't ... But maybe tomorrow . " " I was just thinking of what to wear . " " You ca n't go out . It 's already dark . " " I 'd like to see the river . . . find a little waterfall .... "  | " The only thing there are bums and winos . Tio , can you wait till Saturday , and we 'll go to the park ? " Fausto sipped his coffee and remembered his meal in Cuzco . He had n't even touched the ice cream . " I promised Jess we 'd go to a movie tonight , and tomorrow I 've got to work late . " " Jesus again ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Carmela picked up her plate and walked to the sink . She wiped the scattered birdseed from the dish-drain and placed the ragged sponge behind the faucet . Earlier her uncle had changed the newspaper in Tico-Tico 's cage . Besides watering the carnations next to the veranda , feeding and changing the parakeet were his only chores . " Then I 'll tell you about Peru , " Fausto said . " I thought you were in Panama . . . ? No , Tio , not tonight . Really , I 've got to go . " Fausto reached past the radio and peeked between the gauzy curtains . " He 's not here . Sientate , nina . You can go when he comes . " " We 're going in my car , Tio . " " You mean he does n't take you ? What kind of boy is that ? " " He 's alright , he just does n't have a car . Somebody stole it . " Carmela kissed him on the cheek . " Oh , I made some jello @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When will you be home ? " " Late , so do n't wait up . You know how cold the living room gets . I 'll see you in the morning . " Fausto parted the curtains again and watched his niece open the picket fence gate and hurry to the old Plymouth parked at the curb . He waited for the honk , then turned away . She had lived with him and his wife since she was a baby . Evangelina died when Carmela was nine , and Fausto had to raise the girl by himself . Now she took care of him . But how long would it last ? She would marry this Jesus boy , or someone else , and leave the house . That night Fausto listened to a few tango records , old seventyeights with brown paper jackets and scratchy voices . For once the sadness of the music bothered him , and he replaced it with the liveliest Mariachi song in his collection . Exhausted as he was , he stood on the balls of his feet and trotted around the coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a worried expression . Que le  | hace ? " Fausto explained . " I 'm going to die anyway . " Raising herself from the chair , she approached her husband , a small , stooped man with a dopey smile , and forgave him with a kiss . Now go to bed , he heard her say . Fausto climbed to the bathroom , urinated , and crossed the hallway . He fell onto his bed like a drunk and slept without a dream . In the morning after Carmela left , he began searching his room for a cape . This time he would go prepared for the cold . A doublet and woolen stockings would be nice , too , if he had the right sizes and colors . But a cape would fit anyone , cover any color . Nothing . He looked in closets , drawers , boxes , Carmela 's giant armario , the attic , the linen cabinet , everywhere , in every room . Giving up in the house , he went into the backyard and waded through the weeds beneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shed he found his wife 's hatbox , filled with moth-eaten clothes . Fausto fished past the underwear and pulled out the fragile , pink cape she used to wear on cold nights . He tied the silk tassles under his chin and left the shed . Of course , the fit was perfect , and although the cloth was wrinkled and only hung down to his ribs , there was still a bit of sheen left . For a while Fausto postured in the sunlight next to the trash cans , then marched around the old , headless incinerator . While looking up through the muzzle of smog , he stepped on a hoe , and the handle banged his forehead . " Eva , " he apologized , " I need your cape . I 'll put it back when I 'm done . " Taking the hoe by its rusty head , he entered the house with his staff and announced he was ready . He was n't sure where he was going , either to the river or to the mountains . Maybe the Lincoln Heights bus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Riverside Drive and sat on the bench next to two young women wearing shorts and halter tops . They stopped chewing their gum and openly examined the odd figure with the hoe . Out of the corner of his good eye Fausto could see the slender legs , shaved up to the knees . Why wear clothes , his wife would have said . He nodded to the women and made a clicking sound with his tongue . " Something bothering you ? " the one with dyed-blonde hair asked .  | " You 're very beautiful . " The women looked at each other for a moment and silently seemed to agree he was harmless . The darker of the two turned . " You always that fast ? " " I only say what I see , " Fausto said confidently . He smoothed the wrinkles in his cape and leaned on the hoe . " Okay , who 's the prettiest , her or me ? " " Both of you are . " " Come on , one of us has got to be prettier . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The blonde blew a large , blue bubble , then sucked it in . " That 's a cop-out , " the other said , looking serious . " Now who 's prettier , me or her ? " " She is , " Fausto said . " I knew it , I knew it ! It 's ' cause she 's blonde , right ? " The two waited for an answer . " Well ? " the darker one said . " Tell us , here comes the bus . " " Because you , my dear , " Fausto said , rising from the bench , " ca n't blow a bubble . " The bus pulled alongside the curb and the door folded open with a creak . Fausto stepped aside . The blonde hopped up , but the other woman held his arm . " Hey , what does that got to do with it ? " He turned , blocking her way . " Nothing . " " Then why 'd you say it ? " " You gon na talk all day ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you say it ? " " Let 's go , mister , let the lady by . " " Because I knew she would get madder if I said you were prettier . " " Oh .... ? " And you are . " Goddamit ! I 'm closing the door . You want on or not ? " " Hey , leave the old man alone , " a goateed teenager shouted from the rear seat . " Shut up , you ! " Fausto followed the young woman up the steps and dropped two coins in the meter box . " Watch your stuff , " the driver said . " I got my eye on you . " Fausto walked toward the rear , winking to the two women and  | passing several others who stared at him the way they would a disease . The goatee waved and gave him the thumbs-up sign . " Good try , " he said as Fausto sat down . " But I 'll tell you what 's wrong . " " What ? " The boy slid over to Fausto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " My cape ? " " Yeah , it do n't look too cool . I mean it 's not the thing to wear when you 're trying to score . " " Score ? " " The chicks , man . " The boy cocked his head and pointed with his nose . " They do n't dig capes no more . That went out two years ago . " Fausto inspected his know-it-all neighbor . The kid was dressed all in black . His hair , combed straight back without a part , reeked of Brilliantine , and the cuffs of his long , creased shirtsleeves were turned under one fold . Inquisitive eyes , bony , triangular face . An apprentice wizard . " Thank you for the advice , " Fausto said earnestly , " but I 'll keep my cape on . " " Maybe change the color ? " " No . " The boy leaned over and with his middle finger snapped the creases of his starched trousers . For a while he seemed to lose interest and stared down the aisle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the incline that led to the bridge over the river . Fausto pulled the cord with the hoe . " Hey , I get off here too . " Fausto refused the boy 's help , explaining his staff would do . " Man , " the wizard said , " I thought you was a gardener . " The two left the bus , and Fausto walked to the bridge railing and squinted at the jumble of rocks and tumbleweeds . The boy spit over the edge and counted . He spit again , waited , then turned and clapped his hands . " I know a better place . " " Better ? " Fausto said , surprised . " Yeah , it 's for one-timers only . See , if you jump here , all you do is break a leg or something . " " Who said I 'm going to jump ? " " Okay , you 're not gon na jump . " " And what if I was ? Were you going to help me ? " " Psychology , ese , psychology . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | and nobody 'd want to jump from there . " " What 's your name ? " " Mario . " " Mario que ? " " Do n't be so nosy . Just Mario . " " Alright , Mario . You can help me . " " Hey , I was only playing , ese . " " Help me look for some water . There 's got to be some water down there . " " Sure . . . You had me going for a second . But you ai n't gon na find no water . It 's summer , remember ? " " So there 's no river ? " " That 's right . . . unless you wan na call that a river . " Mario studied the dejected face . " How ' bout something to drink . That 'll help you . " " I do n't drink . " " Come on . Nothing strong . The liquor store 's right over there . " Mario led Fausto to the end of the bridge , across the parking lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ casually looked up at the tall , skinny boy in black and his short , decrepit friend . " Wait here , " Mario said , and he sauntered over the cracked linoleum . Fausto stood in the doorway , nervously tamping his hoe on the rubber mat . The entrance bell kept ringing . " Tell your buddy to stop that , " the fat man said . " What 's he think , he 's in a church or something ? " " He 's sick , " Mario said , frowning hard . " Give us a quart .... " " Some ID first . " " For a quart of milk ? Come on .... " " It 's in the cooler , get it yourself . And tell your friend to stop that shit . It hurts my ears . " Mario motioned Fausto off the mat and went to the cooler . Returning to the counter , he bent over the fat man 's racing page and whispered that Fausto was dying . " Doctor says a few more days , and that 's it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poor guy . Does he know ? " " Yeah , that 's why he 's acting so funny . " Fausto had stopped tamping his hoe ; his cape fluttered timidly under the air-conditioning vent . " Look at those eyes . . . the yellow skin . That 's a sure sign . "  | " Of what ? " " Cholera . " " What 's that ? " the fat man said , squeezing his fingers in one hand . " Hey , he needs his fix of milk . Doctor says that 's all that keeps him alive . How much I owe you ? " " Is what he 's got catchy ? " " Yeah . " " What d' you bring him in here for ? You guys get out ! " " Take it easy . Let me pay you first . " Mario fumbled in his shirt pocket , then searched his other pockets . " I got it somewhere ... just a minute . " As he laid the contents of his wallet on the counter , the fat man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , high-pitched strains of a flute . He dropped his hoe and began to shuffle in circles , uttering raspy , whistling noises . " See what I mean ? " Mario said . " Sooner than I thought . " " Take it ! Go on , get him out of here before he drops . " " Thank you , " Mario said , gathering up his wallet pictures . " God will pay you back . " " Get him out ! " Mario hung an arm over Fausto 's shoulder , and the two walked out . In the parking lot the dance continued . " Hey , you can stop now . We got the milk . " Mario opened the carton spout . " Here , have some . The vato 's still watching us from the window . . . . Come on , drink some , or he 's gon na be after us . " Fausto put the spout to his lips .

" They crossed the street , passed through an empty Standard station and stopped behind the telephone booth . The hard cover of the Yellow Pages dangled from a chain next to a Coke bottle with cigarette stubs floating on the bottom . Mario checked the coin-return slot with his finger , shrugged and caught up with Fausto . The old man was returning to the liquor store , still whistling and pounding his hoe .  | " I ca n't drink this stuff , " Mario said . " You want it ? " " Give it to him , " Fausto said and pointed along the asphalt cracks toward the restrooms . The sleeper had curled himself against the wall , using the telephone book as a pillow . Mario walked over , knelt and picked up the brown paper bag , twisted at the top . " Empty . " He tapped the grizzled head . " Hey , you , want some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peeked in the carton , shook his head and turned over in another position . Mario pushed in the spout and sat down next to the wino . The shade felt good and he wiped a finger around the inside of his buttoned-up shirt collar . Fausto remained on his feet , listening intently . The freeway traffic seemed to have swallowed the flute . " Where you going now ? " Mario asked . " I 'm not sure . " " You know , we make a good team . I did n't think you 'd do it . Man , you should 've seen the pendejo 's face ! He was so scared we could 've copped anything in the store . " Mario patted the wino 's sockless ankle . " We should 've got something for him . " " Ssssh , " Fausto wheezed and turned in time to see a herd of alpacas trot around the street corner . " What 's that ? " Mario said , jumping up . Fausto hurried to the sidewalk . " Vente , do n't be afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curb into the mass of bobbing , furry heads . The shepherd , lagging behind , seemed confused by the traffic lights and horns . At the intersection leading to the freeway on-ramp the frightened alpacas blocked a row of funeral cars , headlights on . Fausto , shouting and waving his hoe , stumbled up the ramp and tried to turn the herd from disaster . Mario ran after him , catching a glimpse of the motorcycle escort racing to the head of the funeral procession . " Hey , ese ! " Mario yelled . " Forget the sheep . " At the bottom of the ramp the bewildered shepherd shrank from the screeching tires as the officer forced his bike past the rumps of the strange , skittish animals . Mario , milk carton tucked to his ribs , made a hopeless gesture with his free hand . The officer had left his bike and was running toward Fausto . But as he left the herd , the officer slipped on some dung . Mario lost no time . Leaping over the ice-plant alongside the pavement , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the milk . By the time he finished , the officer was stiff-arming Fausto down the ramp . The alpacas had abruptly shifted and were being led by the shepherd around the curve and onto the overpass . " Take it easy on him , " Mario shouted . " He 's sick . " " He 's sick alright . . . taking them sheep on the freeway . " " Alpacas , " Fausto corrected , glancing at the herd trotting across the bridge . " I do n't care what they are ... You , too , kid . " " Hey , I did n't do nothin ' . " " My ass . You were helping him . Both of you , get in that car . " The officer , still wiping his hands from the fall , spoke to the driver of the hearse . They argued and the driver gestured to the other cars . Finally the officer returned to the prisoners and ordered them in . " You ai n't gettin ' me in no hearse , " Mario said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ear . The driver and another man with " Forest Lawn " embroidered on his coat pocket had opened the rear door . The driver made a crazy-sign gesture to the next car in line and pointed to the officer . " You first , " the officer told Fausto . The giant 's facewas flushed pink , except for the whitish pock scars , which gave him the look of a madman . Mario helped Fausto up and pushed in the hoe next to the casket . " What 's that ? " the officer asked . " My staff . " " Let me have it . " " No . " " Goddamit ! " and the officer jerked it away from Fausto . It hit the gutter with a clang . " Now you , come here . " Mario backed away from the giant 's arm . " I said , come here ! " " No way ... " The driver and his assistant nonchalantly leaned against the hearse door and watched the boy in black duck between the cars , zig-zagging to the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the wino next to the restrooms sat up , and two boys in car-club jackets yelled , " Pig ! " The officer jammed the revolver into his holster and sprinted back to his motorcycle . Blocks away , Mario waved goodbye and disappeared into the Elysian High recess crowd . The motorcycle sputtered twice , then coasted to the end of the  | ramp . " Milk , " the hearse driver said , casually walking over . " Milk ? " " Yeah , he put milk in your tank . " " You think that 's funny ? " " Me ? no ... " " Well , tell your people we 're taking a ride . " " Wait a minute ! You ca n't use the hearse to go chasing some kid . " " No , dumb-dumb , we 're taking the old man in . I 'll get the kid on the radio . " " You ca n't . He pulled some wires . " The officer dug a fist into his hip and marched around to the rear of the hearse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Excitement 's over . " Hopping up , he poked through the wreaths covering the casket . " Alright , where is he ? " The Forest Lawn men glanced inside . " Beats me , " the driver said . " Must have run away . " " Jesus ! And you guys just stood around and watched ? " " I think he went over there , " the assistant said . " No , I think he 's hiding behind that tree , " the driver said . " Aw , hell , " the officer muttered , " you go on without me . " " You sure ? We can always call off the funeral . " " Go on ... " The caravan moved by , and the giant lowered himself to the curb . Raising his eyes to the hills above the freeway , he saw the alpacas disappear into the ridge of spindly pine trees . He cleared his throat loudly , gurgled and spit on the hoe . At Forest Lawn the gravediggers had already opened their lunchpails when the late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the aluminum handrails and swung around . One of the pallbearers , smaller and older than the others , seemed to falter . " Gentlemen , " the driver said , " easy does it . " " But it 's heavy . Are they always this heavy ? " " Please , gentlemen . Let 's not have a disaster . " The crowd moved toward the burial hole . A carpet of paper grass had been thrown over a patch of dirt just in front of a row of fold-up chairs . The casket was placed on the platform , and when everyone was seated or standing behind the chairs , the minister began .  | Fortunately he was behind schedule . He read quickly , skipping over words and finishing in a mumbled monotone . Done , ashes to ashes , dust to dust . Fausto squirmed . He was nauseous and somewhat cramped by his companion . Bracing himself on the man 's cold forehead , he pushed up on the casket lid , blinked at the sudden light and sat up . He smiled weakly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . " Oh my God ! " " Is that John ? " " Do something . . . " " Gentlemen , please ! " " Jesus ! " " John , is that you ? " " Oh my God ! " " Gentlemen , please , the deceased is still in the casket . . . " " Jesus ! " " John ! Come back . . . "  | FOUR Mario tilted his face horizontal with the roof , eased his ' 57 Impala beside the Good Humor truck and called to Fausto . ' The woman in Levis clicked her money changer and handed the old man the drumstick and a dime . " Come on , get in , " Mario yelled . The dark glasses and sheen of hair were just visible behind the steering wheel . The woman peered at the intruder . " Your friend ? " " Yeah , he 's my friend , " Mario answered . She turned , took the drumstick from the shaky hands and removed the paper . " You know him , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she touched his arm , waiting for the confession . " He ca n't make you go . You stay right here . " Mario leaned over and punched the passenger door open . " Lady , the police are after him . " " I do n't believe it . " " Ask him . " Fausto avoided her eyes , then nodded . Instantly she detected a criminal twitch on one side of his mouth . " Thank you , " Fausto said politely and got in the car . The woman stepped to the open window and looked in . " We keep our guns in the trunk , " Mario explained , dropping the gears into first and pulling away . " Que paso ? " Fausto asked . He licked at the drumstick peanuts . " What do you mean , que paso ? They 're looking for you , you 're a wanted man . " Fausto was silent . He had walked five blocks from the cemetery , resting twice at bus stops . A ragged poodle , two cats and a pigeon had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he concluded . But the worst part about being buried is that they close the lid . How can a man breathe ? See the sky ? Pues not me ... No , senor ! " You have any cigarettes ? " Fausto asked . " Not on me . " " Here , " Fausto said , offering the drumstick . " I 'm not hungry . " Mario took it and began lapping at the melted chocolate on the cone . " Hey , check the glove compartment . Maybe the vato left some in there . " Fausto found a flattened Camel with half the tobacco spilled out . He struck three matches before lighting the wrinkled tip . After a long , fierce draw , a tingle of relief descended to his knees . The sleek Chevy left the boulevard and cruised between small stucco houses with spotty green lawns . Mario drove like a bored prince , head cocked , two fingers on the steering wheel above his crotch . " Nice , eh ? " " What ? " " The car , man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice . " " Not really mine . I sort of borrowed it ... to sabes ... till it runs out of gas . " " You stole it ? " " I 'm not gon na hurt it . I 've had it almost a week and not a scratch . " " That 's illegal . You know that , do n't you ? " " Do n't gim me no lecture . I thought we was gon na be like partners . That 's why I came lookin ' for you . I even got your hoe . " Mario motioned to the back seat with his thumb . " I picked it up after you left . " Fausto turned , a bent column of ash hanging from his lips . The cigarette butt dropped to the seat . " Hey , be careful ! This ai n't my car , remember ? " Fausto apologized and flicked the butt out the window . He asked to be let out immediately , but Mario insisted they stay together . It was the perfect cover , Mario argued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kid in aisle two filches radios , tape decks , clocks , clothes , jewelry ... anything he can fit under his jacket and in his pockets . " Well ? " " I want to go home . If you wo n't let me out here , take me home . "  | " Shit , I thought you and me . . . " " Take me home . " " Okay , okay . " Fausto pointed the way , and Mario seemed to accept the loss as if he had known it all along . " That 's what I get for hanging around viejos . My mother always said I had this thing for old men ... Maybe ' cause my dad was so old . . . . He died last year . ' " That 's too bad , " Fausto said , watching the fur dice swing beneath the windshield mirror . " Not for him . He could hardly wait . Said at least he would n't have to work no more . Yeah , the old cabron just wanted out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No way . " " How do you know it wo n't ? " ' Cause I ai n't gon na work . " As they turned onto Riverside Drive and neared the Elysian Park hills , Fausto asked Mario if he would mind driving to the top . " I thought you said you lived by the river ? " " I do , but the man playing the flute .... " " You mean the vato with the sheep ? " " Alpacas . That 's where he went . " " I do n't know , man . Ai n't that where the police academy is ? I do n't wan na push my luck . " " We wo n't go near the academy . Just take me to the park . " " Okay , but then I 'm leaving . " " Nothing will happen , you 'll see . " Fausto remembered his neighbor 's face behind the tall , chain-link fence . Tiburcio had been mistakenly corraled in an Eastside roundup of Mexican illegals and was in a terrible mood . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , Fausto , " Tiburcio pleaded . " They wo n't believe me . " " I did , but they said they had to wait for more witnesses . " " So get witnesses ! " " I ca n't , everybody 's at work . Just wait a few more hours . " Tiburcio shook the fence like an enraged baboon . " Calmate , " Fausto said , trying to think of some consolation . " You want them to lock you up ? " " What 's this ? " " I mean in jail . " " Fausto , you sound like you 're working for them . Remember , you  | could be here , too . " The rest of that afternoon Fausto sat by the fence pretending he was inside with Tiburcio . What else could he do ? His neighbor would have screamed and shaken the fence if Fausto had dared take a step away . Mario swerved onto the narrow road that bordered the picnic grounds . " You want off here ? " he asked Fausto . " Listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't no siren . " " Stop ... Hear it ? " " Yeah . That your friend ? " " Bye . " " Wait a minute . Let me stop the car . You wan na get killed ? " Mario moved the car into the shade of an oak tree and waited with his foot on the brake . " Take care , man , alli to watcho , and if you ever want to get together , I 'm sometimes around the Market Basket over on North Broadway . " Fausto opened the door . With his hand raised and one foot still in the car , he listened . " Can you wait for me ? " Mario removed his dark glasses and glanced across the level grass toward the main road . Behind the barbecue pits a barechested man was throwing a frisbee to his Doberman . " Okay , but hurry up , " Mario said . " I do n't like this place . " Fausto discovered the shepherd sitting on the edge of a culvert beside the playground swings . The slender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while his animals grazed around the water fountain . He looked up quizzically at the stranger in the cape , then held out his red , cloth pouch with the corn . Fausto shook his head and pointed to his teeth . " I ca n't , " he said , first in English , then explained in Spanish about the pinon shell that once slipped between a bridge wire and his molar . The shepherd dug into another pouch and offered up a handful of coca leaves , along with a piece of chalky white stone . Fausto politely refused , adding he preferred cigarettes . At the sound of the car horn the alpacas propped their heads erect and tested the air . The young man winced . " Do n't be afraid , " Fausto said , stepping next to the culvert . He clasped the timid , moist hand and introduced himself . " I know how you feel . " The shepherd waited until the long , woolly necks were again  | lowered to the ground , then spoke gently , as if the trees should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words and change them into nothing . His name was Marcelino Huanca and he had somehow become lost . Fausto recognized several Quechua words and two or three archaic phrases in Spanish , but the gist of Marcelino 's story was clear : he had wandered from the usual pastures , drifted over the mountain pass and forgetting how late it was had descended into a valley of blinding lights , strange noises and smooth , flat fields as hard as stone . Again the car horn , loud , insistent . Fausto palmed the back of Marcelino 's poncho and invited him home . " I 'll help you . . .. " " And them ? " Marcelino motioned to the herd ; the earflaps of his cap waved like wilted bird wings . Fausto was about to suggest the alpacas come too when he heard the car door slam and Mario 's shrill voice calling him . The shepherd jerked to his feet and rushed at the animals , shooing them up through the brush and trees . In seconds they were gone , leaving Fausto in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Let 's go ! I ca n't wait no longer . " His face glistened and slick strands of hair drooped over his ears . " I found him , " Fausto said , still gazing at the spot where Marcelino had disappeared . " He 'll be back . . . " " Vamonos . " " Wait ... just a few more minutes . Somebody has to help him . You know , he came all the way from Peru . " " I do n't care if he came from China . You ai n't gon na help nobody if some cop sees us . Them vatos train their dogs around here . Man , them dogs 'll rip you up so bad you 'll look like chorizo . " Fausto reluctantly slid off the corrugated culvert and followed Mario to the car . As they reached the curb , a pink frisbee sailed across the street and bounced between Mario 's feet . The big Doberman leaped off the lawn , followed by Mr. America , barefoot and smiling . " Shit , " Mario @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and held it for the drooling , opened jaws . Instead of taking it , the dog growled and sniffed at the two men . " Chorizo , " Mario whispered , " chorizo , man . " Fausto threw the frisbee , and the dog bounded away .  | " Very good , " the barechested man said , swinging the heavy chain leash from his wrist . " He usually bites strangers . " " That 's nice , " Mario said . " Does he like arms or legs ? " " No kidding , " the muscle man said . " You two did alright . " " Is your little test over ? " " Hey , do n't get sore . He 's really pretty good when you get to know him . " " Yeah ? Well , I know some dudes that like to shoot dogs , even good ones . " " Mario , do n't be rude , " Fausto said , stepping between the two . " The boy did n't mean what he said . A little scared , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car , and the two got in just as the Doberman dropped the frisbee by the driver 's side . " Listen , kid . I do n't need this dog to give you a lesson . I could do it right now . And if it were n't for your old man being so nice , I 'd bounce you around like a tennis ball . " Mario stared at the wet , muscular tits in the window . " Is that all ? " " Just that if I ever catch you in this park again , you wo n't leave in one piece . Now get the hell out ! " At a safe distance Mario hung his arm out the door and banged a goodbye with his middle finger . On the drive down to the valley Fausto was already planning tomorrow 's return to the park . " Can you help me ? " he asked , quite confident of the answer . " Are you crazy ! " " I 'll protect you . " " You ? No way I 'm gon na go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sitting on the veranda reading a newspaper . " I 'll see you tomorrow morning , " Fausto said calmly . Mario started to grin , then frowned as he saw Carmela drop the paper and run toward the gate . " Who 's that ? " Mario asked . " Get out ! Hurry , get out ! " " Tio , what are you .... " Carmela glared at the strange face behind the wheel . Fausto pushed himself up from the seat , holding onto the door . " Tio ! That 's not Jess ! " " Of course it is n't . " " What 's he doing with his car ? " " Mijita , do n't get excited . He 's my friend . " Fausto had barely stood when Mario shot the car forward , tires screaming , the door  | flapping once before it locked . " I 'm calling the police , " Carmela said . Fausto struggled after her . " Do n't , Carmela . Do n't do that . " " He 's the one that stole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're after me , too . " Carmela stopped . " Sit down , " Fausto said , " I 'll tell you what happened . " Carmela stood by the screen door , locking her fingers together as her uncle patiently began with his arrival in Lima . Eventually , after much detail , he entered Cuzco . " Tio , get to the point ! " " You want to hear the whole story ? " " Yes , but hurry up . He could be in Long Beach by now . " Fausto continued , Carmela giving up and sitting by his side on the veranda steps . When he reached the part where the alpacas ran onto the freeway ramp , he waited till the last moment , till they had forced the traffic to stop . Then he ran onto the freeway , single-handedly moved the herd to the side , turned around and waved the cars by . " There , you see ? I do something good and they arrest me . " Carmela was silent . " Mario helped me get away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mario ? Is that his name ? What 's his last name ? " " He would n't say . " " Tio , " Carmela said after a long pause , " how can I put this . . . . I do n't know what they do in Peru or Panama or any of those other places , but you 're back in Los Angeles now , and that kid stole Jess 's car . " " Do n't worry , he 'll bring it back . " " How do you know ? " " I know , he 's my friend . " " I hope you 're right ... because if Jess ever finds out . . . well , he .. . he 'd die if he knew you knew . " " So ? " " Tio , be serious . " " Do n't worry , Carmela . Mario will bring the car back . Remember that horse in Mexico ? How you got lost , and it returned to the corral all by itself ? The same thing will happen with Mario @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't admit it to anyone , but that time on the horse , really a mule , she had sat snugly against the saddle horn  | and for the first time had sensed the pleasure of orgasm . Rocking back and forth , her body weak , legs dangling , she had dropped the reins and let the mule follow its own course . It happened under a tree while climbing a hill . Her hair caught lightly on a low , leafless branch , and she grasped the animal 's sweaty neck , hoping to guide it away from the tree . But the mule stubbornly plodded through the high grass , taking the shortcut up the slope . For a long while , hours it seemed , she and the mule roamed about aimlessly . She had been afraid to return , expecting her uncle to notice some change in her face . " Let 's eat , " Carmela said abruptly . She stood and lifted Fausto 's arm . " And pray you 're right about the car . " " You pray , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sat by the front window . " How about some quesadillas ? " she asked . " That 's all there is . " " Anything , mijita . " " I 'll go shopping tomorrow . " Fausto watched her place a large flour tortilla on the skillet . Then she removed the square vegetable grater from a nail above the breadbox . Carefully , without losing a shred , she grated a small block of jack cheese onto the middle of the tortilla . Afterward she walked to the refrigerator , removed a bottle of milk and began to pour some in a saucepan . " I want it cold , " Fausto said . " Doctor Chavez said warm milk . " " Doctor Chavez says that to anybody who 's dying . What else can he say ? " " You 'll drink it warm . If you ca n't stay home and rest , at least you 'll drink warm milk . " " What if he told you to give me poison ? Would you do it ? " " Sure . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were allergic or something . " " Mijita , poison kills people . " " I know , but is n't that what you 're doing walking all over town ? " Fausto shrugged and turned to the window . He lifted the curtain and looked at the gray , smoggy reflection in the night sky . " Carmela , would you mind if someone else lived with us ? " " Who ? "  | " The man I told you about .. . the one with the alpacas . " " That 's a silly question . Of course not . " Carmela set the hot quesadilla and a glass of milk on the table . " Now eat your dinner . "  | FIVE he next morning the cloud of snow gathered itself beyond Pacoima and slowly blew eastward . By morning it had reached the Glendale Boulevard bridge and for a while hovered over the rush-hour traffic . Cars , trucks and buses stopped . Suddenly a woman wearing a purple jump suit and straw pith-helmet propped her scooter against the curb and began throwing snowballs at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then the cloud moved on , occasionally following the course of the LA River . Fausto was changing the parakeet 's newspaper , carefully folding the edges to fit the tray . The bird clung to the side and pecked at itself in the mirror . " I think he needs a tranquilizer , " Carmela said , drying her hands on the dishtowel . " Do n't you think he 's jumpy ? " " He 's happy . " Fausto placed the cage on the portable TV table next to the radio , then raised his arms to embrace the air and shuffled around the kitchen , keeping time with the Mexican polka . His cape , which he had ironed himself with only one brown , burned spot , dangled from his neck like a court jester 's bib . Carmela usually joined him , but this morning it seemed as if he had a partner . He also moved with a spryness she had n't seen in years . " You and Tico-Tico , " she said as he careened toward the sink . " Dance ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tired ? " " A little . " Watching him carry his frail body gracefully about the room , humming to himself , Carmela remembered the children across the street . The two girls had called him Toto . She and Fausto had seen  | them run away apparently giggling over the new name . " Toto ? What does that mean ? " Fausto had asked her . She had said the girls should be taught some respect , but her uncle had insisted it was a good name . Carmela wiped the crumbs from the table . Now with that cape everyone will call you Toto . What a name , what a silly name . After the polka Fausto dropped onto a chair to catch his breath . The two were quiet as the radio announcer briefly mentioned the snow cloud . It was simply described as a " curiosidad " wandering over their neighborhood . " Come on , " Fausto said , hurriedly slipping on his garden shoes . " Let 's go find it . " " You believe that ? It 's probably a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . " " Tio , your shoelaces . " Fausto bent down and fidgeted with the laces . " No puedo . " " I 'll tie them , " she said , sensing an odd excitement in his voice . Fausto wished he had his staff , but that would have to wait . He hurried down the front steps with Carmela at his side . " Look everywhere , " he instructed . " Do n't miss a thing . " At the corner they saw Mrs. Renteria coming toward them , pumping her arms as if she were swimming against the current . " Fausto ! Fausto ! " she cried . " Que pasa , senora ? " The woman held onto Carmela for balance . " Fausto ! " " Say it , senora . " Her wide bosom swelled and she looked behind as if she were being chased . The gray sweater sagged over her belly , and the black , matron shoes were wet and puckered . " I know , senora , " Fausto said . " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " The radio . " Looking up through the web of telephone wires and tree branches , Fausto scanned the sky . " But I just saw it , " Mrs. Renteria said , nodding to Carmela . " With my own eyes ! " " Where ? " Fausto asked . " In my backyard . I was hanging out clothes , then everything turned white . Asi ... whoosh ! " " Is it still there ? " " It 's melting . " " I mean the cloud . "  | " No se . I dropped everything and ran . " " Well , I would n't worry about it . A little snow wo n't hurt your clothes . " " And my flowers ? " " They 'll grow again . " Mrs. Renteria , glancing around , excused herself and moved on down the sidewalk . " Where you going ? " Fausto called . " To Cuca , she 'll know what to do . " Years ago Cuca impressed everyone when she predicted the river would overflow . She was off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reputation as a fortune teller was made . Previously she had been respected only for her healing , but now her clients often brought her impossible requests , like raising the dead or making an iris bloom in winter . Fausto and Carmela watched Mrs. Renteria bob toward Cuca 's house , then they crossed the street and quickly walked the long , sloping block toward the river . When they arrived at Mrs. Renteria 's house , the cloud was gone . At the end of the driveway leading to the garage several neighbors watched with worried expressions as their children ran beneath the clotheslines . " What do you think about this ? " Tiburcio asked . " I do n't know , " Fausto said . " It 's too early to tell . " " It wo n't hurt the children , will it ? " " A little snow ? " " It 's so strange , " Carmela said , nudging the edge of the patch with her toe . " Should n't it be everywhere ? All over ? " " It 's choosy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't touch the avocado tree . That would kill the fruit . " " That 's right , " Tiburcio said . " I guess it wo n't hurt the kids either . " Fausto gazed over the rooftops to the sky , which for the first time in months suggested blue . " Come , Carmela . I have a feeling the cloud went over the fence to the river . " The neighbors followed him out the yard . In the street more joined the group . At the end of the block they rushed past the dead-end barrier , climbed the levee and halted at the top of the bank . Fausto pointed . " Over there ! " The cloud had settled on the river bed , resting on the rocks . A wide streak of snow covered the concrete bank , stretching along the  | bottom to the other side . Mrs. Noriega , her stockings rolled down to her ankles , stepped to the bank 's edge . " It does n't hurt to call the priest . " " What for ? " Fausto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved as they studied the cloud . Once it shouldered itself onto a pile of larger rocks , but nothing more . Carmela bit her nails , the fishman Smaldino wondered how his cod would keep in snow , and Tiburcio 's son Robert noisily puffed air into three wads of bubble gum . When Mrs. Renteria reached the levee , everyone turned . " Cuca says it 's too early to talk about the snow , " the winded spinster announced . " Why ? " Tiburcio asked . " Is n't she supposed to know about these things ? " " She says she has n't had her coffee . " Fausto had decided . He stepped to the edge , shrieked a sort of charging yell , leaped into the air and skidded down the slope to the bottom . Carmela froze , expecting catastrophe . But after a brief silence , Fausto sat up and signaled to the children . In seconds they plunged down , whooping and hollering . The shouting must have wakened the cloud , for no sooner had the children reached Fausto than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With increasing speed it swerved from side to side , eventually dipping under the Pasadena Freeway and disappearing at the bend . Fausto turned to the children . " What are you waiting for ? " They played most of the day , sledding on flattened cardboard , throwing snowballs , shaping snowmen , building castles . Whole families came and many people left their jobs . Someone started a small fire to dry wet socks and pants . Smaldino 's eldest boy bought a pair of splintered Salvation Army skis for two dollars and rented them for five cents a ride . And Mrs. Renteria hauled out an old card table and made snow cones with three flavors of syrup . All this time Cuca had remained at home . The snow had been a blessing for her business , especially fortunes and astrology readings . By early afternoon she had done four of each , plus a half-dozen cures based on some use of snow . For his part , Fausto seemed to have forgotten the snowfield of Peru and his shepherd friend in the hills . Most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legs outstretched , watching the children and soothing his joints with snowpacks . It was n't until Jess  | slapped him on the back that he remembered Mario and the car . " You 'll never believe it , " Jess said excitedly . " They found my car . This morning , over in Culver City . " Carmela glanced at Fausto . " In one piece ? " " Perfect . The tank 's about empty , but that 's all . I was sure the engine 'd be torn up . " Carmela put an arm around Jess 's waist . " Great , I 'm glad nothing happened to it . " " Yeah . . . but what 's weird is that it was in Culver City . They ripped it off in El Sereno . That 's twenty miles away . I do n't know .... " Jess looked at the snow for the first time . He was Carmela 's height , but his strong jaw and wide , handsome face gave him the appearance of a larger man . " They said everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a truck dump a load ? " " It snowed , " Fausto said . " Sure , how much did it cost ? " " It did , Jess , " Carmela said . " This little cloud came by and . . . . Well , ask anybody . " " Yeah .... Hey , let 's drive around some . I got to test everything out . Okay ? " " I ca n't , Jess . It 's Saturday , and I told Tio I 'd stay with him today . " " A couple hours . What do you say , Mr. Tejada ? " " You can call me Fausto . " " I 'll bring her right back . " " Go on , mijita . I 'm not going anywhere . " " Jess will take me shopping , " Carmela said . " Right ? " By evening the children had climbed out of the slush , and Fausto remained alone on the levee . Someone had loaned him a blanket and he lay on the lawnchair with only his face and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a cigarette stub . Tomorrow he would go to the park and find Marcelino . Pobrecito , he was probably out of food by now . Too bad he had n't been at the river . The snow would n't have been new to him , but maybe he would have liked one of Mrs. Noriega 's enchiladas . Or a little soup . " Tio ? Are you still here ? " Carmela approached the dark figure by the bank 's edge , careful not to slip on the water or trip on the snowmen . She touched his shoulder . " Ready to go home ? Jess has the car loaded with groceries . "  | " I 'm ready . " Fausto sighed and pulled off the blanket . " Maybe it 'll snow tomorrow .... " " The kids would freak out . " " Frick . . . ? " " They 'd like it , Tio . Nobody 'd go to misa , and Father what's-hisname would get all pissed . " Carmela took the folded chair and helped him down the asphalt bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , helped Carmela unload the groceries from the trunk , then waited for her to finish shelving the cans , vegetables and frozen meats . He sat at the kitchen table with Fausto . " That smell , " Carmela said , " there it is again . " She looked in the bottom of the pantry , through the grate to the sand under the house . " No , it 's not coming from there . " " I told you , it 's chicha . They drink it in Peru ... something like pulyue . " " Tio , be serious . Why would that ... chichi be here ? " " Chicha . " " Smells like something rotten , " Jess said , opening the window . " Mijita , that 's chicha . How could I forget it ? " " Alright , " Carmela said , putting on her apron , " both of you go wash . And when you 're done ... Jess , you can peel the potatoes and carrots . " " Hey , I ca n't do that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tio , can you look around ? Maybe you forgot some food in the living room . It 's probably those beans I made you last week . " " I ate them . " " Remember the fish I found under the sofa ? Tio , if you do n't like something , tell me . " Carmela watched them leave , thinking she 'd much rather be at her desk in the Hall of Records , no matter how boring the figures were . When the two men returned , she accused her uncle of smoking pot in the utility porch . " It 's that kid you were with , is n't it ? Is he a dealer or something ? Is that why the police were after you ? " " Mijita , what are you talking about ? Pot ? What 's that ? " " Marijuana ! Look in the porch , it 's all over the floor . " Jess reached the porch first . He knelt and picked up a leaf , smelled it , licked it and finally chewed the tip . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | Fausto crinkled a few of the hard , dry leaves in his hand . " I can tell you without even smelling , " he said , smiling . " It 's coca . " " Really ? " Jess said . " Hey , Carmela , he 's all right . " " But it 's not mine , " Fausto said . " It belongs to my friend . " " Tio , you can be arrested for having this stuff . Is n't it like cocaine ? " " Mijita , help me sweep it up . We 'll save it for when he comes back . " " Who 's coming back ? " " I told you , my friend . Not Mario . . . . " " Who 's Mario ? " Jess asked . " Never mind , " Carmela said . .... no , not Mario , but Marcelino . . . Marcelino Huanca. "  | SIX Jess was downstairs watching the wrestling matches on television , Fausto was in bed counting his varicose veins , and Carmela had just flushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself into the bathtub . " Tio ! Jess ! " Carmela yanked up her panties and sidestepped to the door . She yelled again at the top of the stairs , then ran into Fausto 's room . " Do n't move ! " Fausto whispered . He was on the floor fingering the lint under the bed . " Tio , something 's in the bathtub . " " Carmela , can you turn on the light ? One of them got away . " She flipped the switch and glanced into the hallway . " Hurry , Tio ! " Fausto crept forward . " There you are , come to daddy . . . that 's it , come to daddy . " " What is it . " Carmela asked , peeking under the bed . With his index finger and thumb , Fausto picked up the lint and carefully placed it on his right leg . " I was afraid you 'd step on it . Sometimes they crawl off the bed and get lost . " " Something 's in the bathtub . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He patted the flacid , pallid skin and dropped the pajama leg . " A ver . . . help me up . It 's probably a cucaracha . " " No , it 's big . " " Where 's Jesus ? " " Watching tv . . . . Jess ! Come up here ! " Jess was determined to go the limit with Monster Mulhoon , the  | Giant of the Ozarks . " Just a minute , " he answered , then saw the flying kick coming , heard the crack , and his spine broke like a saltine cracker . He fell to the carpet and waited helplessly for another Mulhoon trick . " Jess ! " " Alright , I 'm coming . " Rolling on his side , he socked the armchair cushion , ducked under the hairy eye-gouge and whopped the Giant on the ear . Mulhoon tumbled onto the coffee table . Jess bent over his victim , tweaked the handlebar moustache and skipped away toward the stairs . " What 's the matter ? " he asked at the bathroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Can you take a look ? " " Well , what is it ? A spider , snake , what ? " " Bigger . . . . Jess , I 'm scared . " " Why do n't we call the fire department ? " Fausto elbowed past his niece and pulled back the shower curtain . Marcelino smiled , one hand in the soap dish . Carmela stepped back . " What is it ? " " Marcelino , stand up . " " Smells funny , " Jess said . " Why do n't you make him take a bath ? " " Breathe through your nose , " Carmela said , waving a hand . " Marcelino , please stand up . " " Tio , is this your friend ? " " Yes , he can sleep in my room . " " Is he the cocaine guy ? " Jess asked . Fausto was busy splashing cologne on the red and black poncho . " There , " he said . " Marcelino Huanca , I 'd like you to meet my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's Jess . " Marcelino averted his eyes , nodded and followed Fausto to the bedroom . Jess poked Carmela . " Ask your old man if he speaks . " " You ask him , I 'm tired of sticking my nose in . " " See if he 's got more of those leaves . " " No , Jess . My uncle 's not feeling well . Leave him alone . Tio , let me bring up the cot . You ca n't both sleep in the bed . " " We 're fine , mijita . Just close the door . " " You sure ? I 'll get you another blanket . " ' No , go on . I 'll call you if I need something . And mijita ? "  | " Yes , Tio . " " Turn off the light . " The fog rippled through the streets like an unbreaking wave , caressing houses and trees , pigeons and drunks , with the same wet chill that began to crawl over Fausto 's hands , dipping into the joints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gift . " I wo n't stay here , Marcelino . This is the worst place in the world to die . Anyplace but here . " " Senor , we could go back to my home . " " Yes , I 'd like that . . . . But I 'm afraid it 's impossible . My energy 's gone . Look at me , all shriveled up like a peanut . " " And my alpacas ? " " Do n't worry , I can still go to the park . " " Now ? " " No , it 's better if we sleep first . Besides , you ca n't see anything with all this fog . Earlier Marcelino said he had lost the herd . The animals had scattered when the helicopter descended into the clearing between the trees . A man had chased him down through the cover of dry grass and nettles until he reached the steep cut of earth above the freeway . Marcelino escaped by sliding to the bottom of the cliff , which banked up against the Los Feliz barber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punchy , he had nowhere to go but to Fausto 's . " Buenas noches , " Fausto said . " A little rest , y quien sabe ? Maybe I 'll live another day . " He finished rubbing the Ben-Gay on his hands , turned on his side and fell asleep . But Marcelino could not sleep . In the darkness of the strange room he listened to the pigeons cooing , to pieces of drunken songs , to the constant , eerie cries of rusty freight car wheels . Squatting by the dresser , he watched the silhouette of the old man 's chest rise and fall . Now and then Fausto would cough something into the wad of Kleenex , then drop back onto his pillow . Hours later a rooster broke the air with the first crow of morning . " It 's time , " Fausto whispered , clearing his throat . " Marcelino ? " " Senor ? " " Ah , I thought you had left . " Fausto pulled the lamp cord . Today 's mission would require a certain touch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gentleman . What could  | he wear ? His slippers were nothing extraordinary . His trousers , even when ironed , were n't worth a second look . But a hat ? Yes , that would do it . Since he no longer had a staff , a hat would do nicely . From the closet he brought out a ragged garden hat , dusting the brim and placing it on his head at a smart tilt . In the dresser mirror it looked like a pith helmet , and who would know it was made of straw ? Marcelino waited patiently while his host fumbled with his other clothes . " Can you tie this ? " Fausto said , holding out the tassles of his cape . " I ca n't see too well . " In the kitchen he toasted two slices of rye bread , then prepared a saucepan of double-strength Sanka . Before sitting to eat , he uncovered the birdcage and poured more seed into Tico-Tico 's feeder . Marcelino knelt by the cage and very softly amused the bird with his flute . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll give him some anis , " Fausto said . " That usually helps . " He removed the crystal liqueur bottle from the cupboard shelf over the refrigerator , touched the closed beak with a wet finger and dropped a spoonful of anis in the water dish . The parakeet hopped off the top bar and onto the dish rim . For a moment he eyeballed his reflection , then opened the bluish beak and tried to squeak . " Good boy , Tiquito ! " Fausto explained the bird had a growth removed from his throat , and ever since he had n't spoken a word . " But I think he 's using that as an excuse , " Fausto said , shuffling to the stove . He lit the oven , leaving the door down . " Please , eat . I have to wake up my legs first . " Fausto hiked the kimono above his trousers , and the heat quickly penetrated the material on his thighs and buttocks . Then he turned around to warm his other side . Marcelino meanwhile squatted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I suppose you 're right , " Fausto said . " What good are chairs if you ca n't use them ? I wonder what we 'd do without chairs ? " Dropping the kimono hem , he sat down at the table and stared at the gray reflection between the curtains . Beyond his face a woman 's stooped figure in black struggled by on the way to six o'clock mass . " Maybe we 'd lower the windows . . . . " Fausto watched the woman disappear into the fog . " Marcelino ? " " Senor ? " " Do I look old to you ? " Fausto stiffened his back , hoping for a  | touch of youth at the tip of his chin . Marcelino studied the pose . " Almost .... " " Almost ? " " Well . . . perhaps not almost . You still have a few years left . " Fausto lifted the soggy toast from the cup , slurping loudly . " A few . . . a few days , verdad ? " " If it bothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncle Celso 's remedy ? " " Does it hurt ? " " Only if it does n't work . Then you die like everyone else . " " Nothing works . " " They say it puts new life back in the old skeleton . " " What about the rest of me ? " " Oh , that too . " " So what do I do ? " " If I remember . . . Celso started with a bag of stones all about the same size . You take the stones and make a little pile . You make it as high as you can , until you are sure no more stones can be put on top without falling . Then , and this is the hardest part . . . if you truly believe you can , you place one more stone on top . If it stays and does not fall , you will be as strong as the last stone . Nothing can make you fall . " " What if there 's an earthquake , a little wind or something ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Everything . " Fausto was silent while he finished his Sanka . " I do n't know , " he said , carrying the cup and saucer to the sink , " it sounds risky . Tell me , did this remedy work for your uncle ? " " No , the rain washed the stones away . " " Of course . " " They say he died a happy man . The birds had already taken his eyes , but you could still see the smile . " They were quiet . Fausto tapped the table edge with one finger , then scooped up the bread crumbs and dropped them in the cage . " You know , Marcelino , I like that . But my pile of stones will be under the house . . . in case it rains . " Daylight had pushed through the fog , illuminating Fausto 's little  | tower of life . Marcelino congratulated him and said it had taken more than skill . Courage did it . " And no cheating , " Fausto added . " It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could do it . " The two slapped the sand from their hands , brushed the moist grains from their clothes and started the trek to Elysian Park . After what seemed like hours , they left Stadium Way and followed a narrow , potholed street without curbs . At the first bend in the road they were met by two men resting behind a barricade . The men were young , black and wore tan uniforms with ironed creases running from their shirt pockets to their trouser cuffs . The tallest had just finished telling how his wife could pick up the highway patrol on a tooth . " The dentist put this piece of steel in , and now she wants him to turn it off ! " The short man laughed and turned the radio dial to another station . Out of the corner of his eye he saw the two strangers turn the bend . " Check this . " Fausto approached first , Marcelino remaining a few steps behind . " Gentlemen , good morning , " he said , tipping his hat . " Morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wink . " May we pass ? " " Depends . You friend or foe ? " " Foe ? " " Foe , huh ? " The tall man glanced at his partner . " Should we arrest him ? " " I mean friend ! " Fausto blurted . " In that case . . . . Suppose you follow the road , my good man . " " Yes , thank you . Come , Marcelino , we 're safe . " The wooden barricade slid back , and the two guards snapped a salute and waved them on . " Why are they so black ? " Marcelino asked after they had walked a short distance . " You 've never seen black people ? " " No . My cousin Aurora is very dark , but she 's never been black . " " Well , do n't believe what you see , they do n't paint themselves . That 's the way they were born , black . " " The burn they have . . . it does n't hurt ? " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to explain how the first Europeans in the Americas actually thought some of the people they saw on the shore had tails and lived in trees . " Tails ? " " Long ones too . . . here , between your legs . " " Senor ! " " It 's true . You know , they even said some people were green and lived in the ground . That was Ponce , he was n't very smart . " " In the ground ? How could a man breathe ? " " I do n't know , Ponce liked to make up stories . But if you think that 's strange , in Patagonia they said they saw giants with huge feet . And during the winter when there was no food , the giants ate their children . " " Those are crazy men 's stories . " " I know , but this world is full of crazy people . " They entered the city through the main arch . People , mostly black , crowded along the walls and in the passageway . Marcelino stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large mulatto raised a chicken by its neck . Beside him another man unraveled a thick snake . And over there , Fausto explained , that woman is selling her daughter . " But why ? " " For money . " Marcelino gazed at the other black faces . Some had scars and they spoke words he could not understand . He would have liked to touch their skin and hair . " Come , " Fausto said , " let 's see what 's inside . " They stepped between the squatting bodies and passed under the arch . Inside the city wall they faced a nearly empty plaza . Fausto hesitated , inspecting the fresh , evenly spread sand . The smell of paint filled his nostrils , and looking to one side above the wall , he noticed a telephone pole disguised as a palm tree . " Where are we ? " Marcelino asked . " I do n't know . . . Colombia . . . Trinidad . . . Santa Marta , I do n't k now . I thought I could recognize something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other side of the plaza a group of shirtless blacks emerged from a barnlike building followed by a white man on horseback . When the group had gathered itself on the street , the blacks crowded  | close and listened to the white man . Now and then the mob would shout and wave their machetes in the air , the wild glints of steel driving terror into Marcelino 's eyes . " I think we 're expected , " Fausto said , calmly adjusting the pleats of his cape . " Could you play something with your flute ? It might impress them . " Marcelino lifted the hollow cane to his dry lips but could only manage a timid rasp . They walked toward the group . As they reached the plaza 's center , a baldheaded man in a bushjacket hollered from the top of the barn . The horse reared and wheeled into the machetes . The bushjacket shouted again , this time into a megaphone . " English , " Fausto said . Marcelino nodded and continued rasping . " Get those guys out ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are those anyway ? " The horse charged into the plaza . Fausto waited , then raised a hand before the animal could stop . " Sir , let me introduce myself .... " " Get out of here ! Ca n't you see .... " " And whom do I have the pleasure of addressing ? " " I'he rider dismounted and took Fausto by the hand . " It 's late , " he said , " and everyone wants to be the big cheese . But not now , okay , old buddy ? " " Sir , I am Don Fausto Tejada , and this is my companion Marcelino Huanca . " " And I 'm Marlon Brando . Listen , go wait in that building . When the revolution 's over , you can come out . " " Revolution ? " " Yeah , we 've got one more take to do , then it 's all over . Now be a good fellow and wait in there . " " Certainly . . . . I believe I was mistaken about our location , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them , " the man shouted to a woman in cut-off Levis and sneakers . Fausto and Marcelino were shown into a smoke-filled room and told to sit . Around them were racks of clothes , small tables with mirrors , and in the middle next to the cots a table with beer , ice , gin and Dixie cups . Most of the crowd was by the table . " Wrong period , " the woman said to Fausto . " We 're doing seventeenth century . " She turned to Marcelino . " And that 's out , definitely . Anyway , we 're not shooting Indians . " " He 's Peruvian , " Fausto said .  | " You do n't say ? " Spreading a wet armpit , she drew a circle in the air with her cigarette . " I 'm from Oklahoma myself .... Why are you looking at me like that ? " " Would you mind ? I have n't smoked all day . " " Sorry . I know , the first day 's a bitch . " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , sure . Take this . " She lit another for herself . " Where do you guys fit in ? " " Nowhere , they wo n't let us leave . " " I thought you were the beggars . They 've got a few of those , you know . " " Madame , do we look like beggars ? " " Well , I 'm a whore . " " Madame , we are visitors . " " I also play a flower girl . I did that yesterday . " " I hoped we would be treated with respect . " " Do n't get so touchy . One day a beggar , another day a soldier . And do n't call me madame . I 'm just a whore . " " Miss , under whose orders are we being held ? " " No one 's holding you . Relax , have a drink . " Fausto had puffed down to the filter . Marcelino , clinging to the edge of the cot , watched the strange figures around him . They were all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ midget exercising alone in the corner . Marcelino stared at the squat , stumpy legs and wondered why the man had not grown up . The woman drew back , tilted her head sideways and squinted . " You know , there 's something about you two , something really authentic . But do n't let casting catch you in those outfits . " She rubbed the greasepaint from her nose and moved away . " Stick around , I 'll see you later . " Fausto grew restless ; he was concerned about Marcelino . His friend had now retreated into his poncho , dazed from the smoke , noise and a throbbing fear that someone was about to knock him to the floor . His lips quivered and his eyes were closed . " Let 's go , " Fausto whispered . While no one was watching , the two authentics rose and slowly walked toward the brass-handled doors . Outside , the revolution had started . " Stay close to me , Marcelino . And whatever you do , do n't get yourself killed . " They left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | flailing bodies . Suddenly the megaphone cried , " Cut ! " But the fight had started , already sweeping men and horses into a blind frenzy which could only end in victory or defeat . The rebels were falling , blood spurted on the clean sand , the plaza was lost , they were surrounded , and the voice about kept yelling , " Cut ! Cut ! Cut ! " Marcelino tripped on a fallen horse and started to get up . " Stay down ! " gurgled a man with a lance in his stomach ; the blood spilled from his mouth . " You 're dead , " he said , slumping to the ground . Marcelino leaped up and rushed after Fausto . A line of men in blue coats and shiny , black hats charged out of the arch . " That way , " Fausto said . He clutched Marcelino 's hand , and the two stumbled off the set , underneath the prop braces , escaping into a portable restroom . For a long while they huddled together , listening to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're safe , " Fausto said . " Let 's go . " The fugitives fled through the parking lot , past the snackbar and into the woods . It was n't long before they reached the television antenna overlooking the park . The fog had turned to smog , revealing the dim outline of the upper city walls . The two men leaned against the tall , Cyclone fence . " I 'm sorry , " Fausto said , his chest heaving with harsh , brittle noises . " It was a trap . I should have known when I saw the telephone pole . . . . Cartagena has charm , and they treat visitors with respect . " Marcelino removed his chullo cap and wiped his forehead . " Why were they fighting ? " " They 're making a movie . " " What 's that ? " " It 's a picture of people who move . " " They talk too ? " " Everything , they do everything we do . . . even fight . " The nightmare swirled in Marcelino 's head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man spewing blood , the machetes hacking at the blond , blue giants . " But there 's a difference between them and us , " Fausto said . " We can leave the movie , and they ca n't . They 're trapped . " " Were those men dead . . . the ones on the ground ? " " No , they just look dead . " " And the blood ? "  | " Dye , red dye . " Marcelino sat on the ground and pulled out his flute . " Not now , " Fausto said . " We 're too close . " " I 'm calling my alpacas . " " Wait , we 'll look for them later . Let me rest a while . " Fausto could count the heart beats ; they were loud , convulsive beats . It was as if his heart were angry at not being released . " I 've still got you , though . You ca n't leave me yet . " " What ? " " Nothing , I was talking to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . " " Senor , have you forgotten ? " " What ? " " The remedy . " " Marcelino , I was going to ask you . . . should n't I be feeling something by now ? " " Everyone is different . Sometimes the remedy takes longer with some than others , and sometimes it helps only a part of you . . . your liver , your back , your eyes . It 's hard to say . " " But I thought you said my whole body ? " " Senor , I 'm not an expert in these things . I say what they told me , and that 's all . " Fausto thumbed his temples and reflected on his chances of survival . What could he do with a young pair of legs ? Nothing , not if the rest of him were old . A new heart ? Silly . . . when his head and yes , loins , were as dry as those leaves on the ground . And if he were all new , fresh and strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do then ? Sell books ? Would he marry the rancher 's daughter from Chihuahua , would Evangelina die so soon , would he grow old , tired and lonely again ? No , none of that , please .... Perhaps it would be best simply to have a new brain , or new eyes . Then he could see the world as it should be , if only for a few months , a few days . Yes , I would like that . How I would like new eyes ! " Marcelino , do I have a choice ? " " A choice of what ? " " What part of me will be new . " " It 's a matter of luck . " " Maybe nothing , is that it ? " " Maybe nothing .... "  | Fausto rose with difficulty and gazed at the smog-shrouded horizon some fifty yards away . The gray veil parted , and the little snow cloud emerged , springing nimbly up the station antenna above them . And there it remained , tickling itself red on the aircraft warning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " maybe I 'll be lucky . "  | SEVEN That afternoon after Fausto had left Marcelino with the alpacas , Mrs. Noriega 's grandchildren discovered David in the dry riverbed . The young man was absolutely dead , the children could see that . For a long time they had watched him from behind the clump of cat-'o-nine'tails . His body lay so still even a mouse , poking into one dead nostril , suspected nothing . The girl approached first , leaving behind her two brothers . David 's brow was smooth ; his gray-blue eyes were half closed ; his hair was uncombed and mixed with sand ; his dark skin glistened , clean and wet ; and the rest of him , torn shirt and patched trousers , was also wet . " He drowned , " the girl said . The boys ran over for their first good look at a dead man . David was more or less what they expected , except for the gold tooth in front and a mole beneath one sideburn . His name was n't David yet ; that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the name of a boy who drowned years ago when Cuca predicted it would n't rain and it did and the river overflowed , taking little David to the bottom or to the sea , no one knew , because all they found was a washtub he used as a boat . " How could he drown ? " one of the boys asked . " There 's no water . " " He did , " the girl said . " Look at him . " " I 'm telling ! " the other boy said , backing away . The boys ran across the dry sand and pebbles , up the concrete bank and disappeared behind the levee . Before the crowd of neighbors arrived , the girl wiped the dead face with her skirt hem , straightened his clothes as best as she could and tried to remove the sand in his hair . She raised David 's head , made a claw with her free hand and  | raked over the black hair . His skull was smooth on top , with a few bumps above the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side , then lay his head on her lap . Tiburcio and the boys were the first to reach her , followed by the fishman Smaldino and the other men . Most of the women waited on the levee until Tiburcio signaled it was okay , the man was dead . Carmela helped Mrs. Noriega first , since it was her grandchildren who had discovered David . Then she gave a hand to the other older women . Mrs. Renteria , who appeared even more excited than the others , later suggested the name David . For some time they debated the cause of death . No bruises , no bleeding , only a slight puffiness to the skin , especially the hands . Someone said they should remove the shoes and socks . " No , " Tiburcio said . " Leave him alone , he 's been through enough . Next you 'll want to take off his clothes . " Tiburcio was overruled : off came the shoes , a little water and sand spilling out . Both socks had holes at the heels and big toes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In this way they discovered the man not only lacked a small toe on one foot but also had a large tick burrowed in his right thigh and a long scar running from one hip almost to the navel . " Are you satisfied ? " Tiburcio said . Everyone was silent . David was certainly the best-looking young man they had ever seen , at least naked as he now lay . No one seemed to have the slightest shame before this perfect shape of a man ; it was as if a statue had been placed among them , and they stared freely at whatever they admired most . Some of the men envied the wide chest , the angular jaw , and the hair , thick and wavy ; the women for the most part gazed at the full , parted lips , the sunbaked arms , the long , strong legs and of course the dark , soft mound with its finger of life flopped over , head to the sky . " Too bad about the missing toe , " Tiburcio said . " And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a match and held it close to the whitish sac until the insect withdrew . There were oos and ahhs , and the girl who had combed the dead man 's hair began to cry . Carmela glanced at the levee and wished that her uncle would hurry . They all agreed it was death by drowning . That the river was dry occurred only to the children , but they remained quiet , listening to  | their parents continue about what should be done with the dead man . Smaldino volunteered his ice locker . No , the women said : David would lose his suppleness , the smooth , lifelike skin would turn blue and harden . Then someone suggested they call Cuca , perhaps she knew how to preserve the dead . Cuca had cares for everything , why not for David ? " No ! " Mrs. Renteria shouted , unable to control herself any longer . " He 'll stay with me ! " Although she had never married , had never been loved by a man , everyone called her Mrs. out of respect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , squarish woman who surrounded her house with flowers and worked six days a week changing bedpans and sheets at County General . " David is mine ! " she shouted for all to hear . " David ? " Tiburcio asked . " Since when is his name David ? He looks to me more like a . . . . " Tiburcio looked at the man 's face . " ... a Luis . " " No , senor ! " another voice cried , " Roberto . " " Que Roberto  --  Robert ! " " Antonio . " " Henry . " " Lupe ! " Alex , Ronnie , Armando , Trini , Miguel .... Everyone had someone . Meanwhile Mrs. Renteria left her neighbors who one by one turned away to debate the issue . For a while she knelt beside David . Then she stood and wrung out the sopping , gray shorts and began slipping his feet through the leg holes , eventually tugging the elastic past the knees to the thighs . Here she asked for help , but the group did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong by years of spinsterhood , she rolled David onto one side , then the other , at last working the shorts up to his waist . The rest was the same , and she finished dressing him by herself . When the others returned no one noticed the change , for David appeared as breathtaking dressed as he did naked . " You 're right , " Tiburcio announced , " his name is David . . . but you still ca n't have him . " About this time Fausto arrived followed by a hip figure in a black , sheeny shirt and starched khakis . Mario had returned the hoe and now helped the old man across the broken glass and rocks . Fausto ,  | winking at his niece , immediately grasped the situation . David was a wetback . Yes , there was no mistake . Had n't he , Fausto , brought over at least a dozen young men from Tijuana  --  one by one , cramped into the trunk of the car ? Of course Fausto knew , for even after these men found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dressed in new clothes but always the same type of clothes . Maybe Fausto was n't too quick to recognize women illegals , but the men , like young David there , were an easy mark . " How can you tell ? " Smaldino asked . The old man raised his staff and pointed to the gold tooth , the cut of hair , the shirt collar tag , the narrow trouser cuffs , the thick-heeled , pointy shoes . " It 's all there . You think I do n't know a mojado when I see one ? " As a last gesture he closed the dead man 's eyes . " Now .. . what will you do with him ? " " Toto , " a small voice came from below ; the girl pulled at Fausto 's cape . " Toto , can I have him ? " " No , mija , he 's too old for you . " Mrs. Renteria repeated her claim , and before the-others could object , Fausto asked in a loud voice what woman among them needed a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Speak up ! Which of you can give this man your entire love , the soul of everything you are ? Which of you , if not the senora here who has no one ? " The wives looked at their husbands , and the girls and unmarried women waited in awkward silence . " Then it 's settled , " Fausto said with unusual authority . " You , Tiburcio ... Smaldino and you , Mario , take this man to her house . " " Hey , I ai n't touchin ' no dead man , " Mario said . Carmela stepped forward . " That figures . You 'll go around stealing cars , but you wo n't help your own kind . " " Alright , alright , " Mario muttered , " one time and no more . " That evening so many visitors crowded into the small , frame house next to the river that latecomers were forced to wait their turn in the front yard . Even Cuca , her stockings rolled down to her ankles , had to wait in line . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair and lightly powdered his cheeks . He wore new clothes ( Mario 's contribution ) and sat quietly in a waxed and polished leather recliner.  | The neighbors filed by , each shaking the manicured hand , each with a word of greeting or a good-natured joke about the first night in bed . And most everyone returned for a second , third and fourth look at this treasure of manhood which might not survive another day of summer heat . Like all discoveries , it was only a matter of time until David 's usefulness would end , till the colognes and sprays would not mask what was real , till the curious would remain outside , preferring to watch through the window with their noses covered , till the women retreated into the yard , till the men stopped driving by for a glance from the street , till at last only Mrs. Renteria was left to witness the end . Happily this was a solitary business . For several days she had not gone to the hospital , her work was forgotten , and she passed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , giving her secrets . And not once did he notice her splotchy hands , the graying hair nor the plain , uninspired face . During the warm afternoons David would take her out , arm in arm , to stroll through the lush gardens of his home , somewhere far away to the south . He fed her candies , gave her flowers and eventually spoke of eternity and a breeze that never dies . At night she would come to him dressed as a dream , a sprig of jasmine in her hair , then lie by his side until dawn , awake to his every whisper and touch . On the third day Fausto knew the honeymoon was over . The shepherd Marcelino , safe in the park beneath the station antenna , had already raised his flute to sound the first note of mourning . " Senora , " Fausto called at the door , " it 's time David left . " Mrs. Renteria bustled out from the kitchen . Her hair was down in a carefree tangle and she wore only a bathrobe . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a smile . " He died this morning ... about an hour ago . " Fausto examined her eyes , quite dry and obviously sparkling with something more than grief . " He died ? " " Yes , " she stated proudly . " I think it was too much love . " The odor of death was so strong Fausto had to back down the steps . " Senora , I 'd be happy to take him away for you . Leave it to me , I 'll be right back . " He turned quickly and shuffled toward the sidewalk . " Wait , " she shouted . " He 's already gone . "  | " I know , but I 'll take him away . " " That 's what I mean . This little man  --  chaparrito y con una gorrita  --  took him just before you came . " " A little man ... ? Wearing a poncho ? " " That 's him . " " Esta bien , senora , your David will get the best burial possible . " Mrs. Renteria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refused . " No to apures , we 'll take care of him . The body goes , but the soul .... " " I know , his soul is right here . . . in my heart . " " Good , keep him there . Because if you ever lose him , watch out for the other women . " " He 'll never leave . You see , I have his word . " She pulled a folded scrap of paper from between her breasts and studied the scribbled words . Fausto nodded , then asked if he should say something special at the burial . " Some prayer ... a poem ? " Mrs. Renteria answered with a toss of her head , and for a moment her glassy eyes were lost in the distance , somewhere over Glendale . Then she closed the heavy , wooden door , clicked both locks and dropped the blinds behind the big bay-window . But David was not buried . He left Elysian Valley better than when he had arrived . A man so perfect should not be buried , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and using a knowledge more ancient than the first Inca , than the first Tarahumara , the old man painstakingly restored David to his former self . Even the missing toe was replaced . By late evening the restoration was almost complete . Only one chore remained . Carmela brought the pitcher of water into the yard and wet the dead man 's clothes , the same shabby clothes he wore when they found him . " More water , " Fausto said . This time Mario took the pitcher and skipped into the house . He had watched the transformation completely fascinated . David was about his own age , heavier , but he could have been a brother . And ever since Mrs. Renteria had taken him for her own , Mario 's admiration for the young mojado 's quiet sense of confidence had grown . The vato is cool , Mario thought as he emptied the pitcher over the dead man 's body .  | Fausto then asked for the egg , a dried quetzal egg Mario had plucked from the Exposition Park ornithology hall . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Cuca once told me that you do this " ? and here Fausto lightly brushed the egg on the dead man 's lips ? " and it brings him good luck . I do n't believe it , but just in case . . . . " Fausto stood back and examined his work under the porch light . " Mario , pick him up . " " Hey , man , I thought it was over . " " Almost . Just do as I say . " Mario struggled with the body , finally lifting it over one shoulder . Carmela opened the gate . " Stay here , " Fausto told her . " Tio ! " she called after the men had moved into the darkness . " Where you taking him ? " " Further down the river , " came the faint reply , " where others can find him . "  | EIGHT Later , after Mario and Marcelino had gone , after Jess had taken Carmela to the movies , Fausto quietly engaged his own ? ' image of David 's coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as Mrs. Renteria said ? Was the young mojado good because he was dead , or was he dead because he was good ? Something must have killed him . Fausto listened to the sound of his own feeble heart . Reassured , he lit another cigarette and decided the question hardly mattered , since mojados like David would continue coming and going  --  dead , halfdead or alive  --  despite what anyone thought they should do . Thousands , hundreds of thousands , were waiting for a taste , a glimpse , of paradise . Or just a job . Of course , that 's it , Fausto thought . If his wife did n't interfere , what better guide could they have than someone , someone like himself , who could tell them about life and death in the United States , who could also bring them across in style . No more hiding , no more climbing the hills like wild dogs . The operation would be decent , respectable , the plan quite simple . Fausto had been staring at the cracks in the ceiling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bubbles and jagged hollow spaces that caught the light from the hallway . The slaky surface was covered with vague designs , tiny ridges , plains , valleys , mountains , coastlines . He studied the map and hoped his ships had found safe harbor . Sturdy ships they were , built of the finest Durango timber . At this moment they were awaiting their commander 's arrival in Venice or Malibu , whichever was better . Fausto would order his captains to  | weigh anchor before the morning tide . Then they would sail to Mexico 's western ports and fill the holds with all the hungry , desperate men willing to ship out with only a promise in return . " Fausto , what are you doing ? " Fausto peeked over the sheet and saw his wife standing in the doorway . " Thinking , " he said . " If you 're thinking what I think you 're thinking ... stop thinking . You 'll never last a day . " " I will too . " He watched her approach . " Eva , I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Remember the time we went to Catalina ? You got seasick before the boat left the harbor . I 'm telling you , you wo n't last an hour . " Fausto dropped his head on the pillow . She was right , but it annoyed him that she came after all the preparations had been completed : the provisions , the crews , tourist cards , everything  --  even a to-whom-it-may-concern scroll which he had signed with great flourish , concluding the message with a coat of arms all his own . Now she has to come . A few more minutes and I would have been driving south-southwest under a full sail , a strong wind at our stern . Evangelina sat on the bed and reached under the sheet for the cold , knobby hands . " Why do n't you stay home and rest like Carmela says ? " " Eva , there 's too much to do . And why should I rest ? That 's all I 've done for the last six years . " She touched his brow , then tickled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " " That 's easy for you to say . You 're not the one who 's dying . But me ? How do I know that stone under the house wo n't fall ? It could happen any minute . " " Alright , but stay away from water , entiendes ? " Fausto nodded . " And whatever you do , take your pills . " " Pills , pills , pills , they 're all sugar .... You know , I liked Doctor Ramirez . He gave me cigars . " " Fausto , he 's dead . " " I know , but I was thinking it would have been nice if Chavez had died instead of Ramirez. " " ... and do n't smoke so much .... "  | Fausto turned on his good side and began counting his ribs , fingering each bone as he listened.to his wife go on about his slippers , the cold floor , the sudden drafts , his eating and a visit to Doctor Scholl 's to have his corns removed . " By the way , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A little trip . . . not far . " " Where ? " " Mejico ? " Fausto whispered . " Mexico ! What about Peru , and I thought you wanted to see Argentina ? Those are such nice places . " " I changed my mind . I want to go back to Mejico . " " What for ? " Fausto was silent . He hung a finger around his collarbone and glanced at the map . " You 're hiding something , " she said . " What is it ? " He forced a cough and mumbled something about pyramids , music and Aztec legends , finally asking her if she would like to come . " Me ? No , gracias , I remember the last time . And you think it 's changed ? " " I did n't say that . " " No ... you go . See if you do n't get diarrhea . I would n't be surprised if you came back dead .... But it 's your life . Just remember I warned you . " Evangelina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her blessing . Fausto opened his eyes ; she was gone . He was glad she had n't pried it out of him , yet he really could n't blame her for disappearing at the idea of visiting Mexico . The last time they went she had lost her voice and thirteen pounds . The other trip , taken years ago , had convinced her Mexico was for Mexicans . They had been there two weeks , driving south from Juarez to Mexico City . At the time the newspapers and the highway were crowded with the cars of the Pan American Road Race , and Fausto 's new , ' 53 Buick had taken an early lead . Along the route thousands of dusty faces craned for a glimpse of the famous drivers , the big circled numbers , the signs , the slogans , the camera crews , a senator , a movie star . There were foreign names and words like Penzoil , Mobil , Firelli and Goodyear ; tall men with blonde women ; bands in every plaza , and parades of uniformed children waving red , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contained herself and little Carmela played string games or read comic books in the back seat . Although his Buick was an unofficial entry  --  only because he would n't pay the fee  --  everyone recognized him . Entering a city , he would sit back proudly and wave to the crowds lining the narrow sidewalks . He had already announced he would give up the prize money ; it would go to an orphanage or to a school for the blind . Yes ! the papers would scream , it was the driver without the helmet . The race was n't the Gran Prix , but it demanded all the skill and courage of a professional , a true champion . This was in his mind as he eased into the Pemex pitstop in downtown Queretaro . He nodded to the mechanics and casually clicked off the ignition . It was almost over , one more leg , victory was practically in his lap . " Fausto ! I told you to stop where it 's clean . " " Sorry . . . I forgot . " Evangelina had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cursed the brimming bowls , the caked , hole-in-the-floor toilets , the slimy footpads on each side , praying not to slip , trying to ignore the cockroaches in the corners and under mounds of crumpled , dirtied newspaper . And each time there was no way of telling what was behind those doors . Even in the best hotels and restaurants , Evangelina  --  expecting American whiteness , spotless tile , crisp paper towels , at least soap  --  would enter and have to balance herself over another wet toilet seat . " Gente atascada ! That 's why they are the way they are .... Some vacation ! You and your ideas .... And look at Carmela . If she does n't get sick from all this filth , it 'll be a miracle . . . . See those men against the wall ? Orinando , as if they did n't know how to use a bathroom . Now I know why my father wanted to leave this place . " " Calmate , " Fausto said . " We 'll go somewhere else . " He signaled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead-car into the street . " Stop there , " his wife said as they neared a newer Pemex station . " That looks clean . " By the time the car was alongside the pumps , Fausto had decided to drop out of the race . What 's one race ? The only losers will be the blind children and the orphans . And what they do n't get now , they 'll get the next time I win . He endured the rest of the trip by singing . Alone to himself , or with the mariachis on the radio . Occasionally he joined them in a huasteca ,  | using his falsete until his voice cracked . Carmela said he sounded like a rooster with a cold , while Evangelina , ignoring the coo-coo-roos , clutched her travel brochures and counted the kilometers to the capital . No , he could n't blame her . But like his friend said , Mexico has changed . Last year Tiburcio came back from Guadalajara and described the new buildings , the lights , all the cars and the new trailer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's not like before .... " " What about the restrooms ? " " No problem , our camper has a toilet . " But it was only for his wife that he asked . Fausto himself hardly worried about dirty toilets . What troubled him now were the mojados . He studied the map again . Too bad , the ships would have to return  --  all that effort for nothing . The other plan was more risky . Ni modo , he had no choice . Fortunately Tijuana had not changed . The same . Marines and sailors still swarm over and back on weekends , unquestioned , free to come and go as they please . Fausto climbed onto the empty oil drum and scanned the hundreds of drawn , bony faces . Then he motioned for the tequila . " All of you , listen to me ! " he shouted . " Do as I say and I 'll take you across . " No one moved . " Drink ! " Fausto shouted . " Drink until you ca n't walk straight . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some fidgeted with the strange caps . Should they trust the old man ? Why was he doing this . . . and for free ? Was it poison ? " What are you waiting for ? " Fausto asked . " Do you want to see the United States or not ? " The men gazed at the patient , gray sky , or at the neat rows of houses and the green freeway signs beyond the border . Was it for the gold and silver in their teeth ? " Alright , " Fausto said , " I 'll count to a hundred , and if all these bottles are n't empty by the time I finish , I 'm going without you . Find someone else to take you across . " Fausto began counting . At seventy-three the bottles were empty . " Good . Now follow me . " " Wait a minute , " someone said , touching his shoulder . Fausto did n't have to guess who it was . Evangelina loved to have the last say .  | It was like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He wanted to say it was only a thought , a dream , harmless , nothing to get excited about . But she knew better . As he was about to give himself up in a sweet , effortless motion , his wife suddenly wedged her leg between him and the young intruder . Fausto squirmed and the woman vanished . " She 's really you , " he explained . " I just changed your nose a little and gave you bigger hips . " Evangelina had smiled , then she placed herself on the old man 's fire . But what 's his excuse now ? She had seen his army of nobodysdesgraciados , she would say  --  and how could he convince her they were simply men ? " Is this right ? " she asked . Fausto shrugged . " Who else can help them ? " He knew what she was thinking . Whenever she put her lips together like that , tightly , as if she were trapping the words , afraid they might hurt him , whenever she arched her penciled eyebrow , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said , sniffing the alcoholic breeze , " but I hope you know we have too many mojados already . " " Eva , I know what I 'm doing . Besides , they can always go back . " At that moment Marcelino danced into the circle of curious faces . He raised his flute and pointed toward the row of border patrol booths . " Ay , Faustito , " Evangelina said . " You 're the one-eyed man leading the blind  --  el rey Tuerto . " The men , following the lively sound of Marcelino 's flute , staggered past the guards , slowly , in two 's and three 's , sometimes singly , until everyone was across . Everyone except Fausto , who apparently aroused suspicion because of his cape , staff , possibly his dark looks . He was ordered to wait in a small , barren room where his clothes were searched and his body thoroughly examined . " Those are corns , " he told the guard , wincing as the metal probe played between his toes . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pause the Gettysburg Address , the Pledge of Allegiance and Franklin Roosevelt 's death announcement . It was an old trick , but when the guard heard Roosevelt 's name , he was convinced . Fausto was given his clothes and told to leave . " By the way , where 'd you learn that ? " Fausto stepped into his wrinkled trousers . " I used to sell books of  | knowledge ... and that 's one of the things you can learn . I sold a lot of sets that way . " " Well , we 're not stupid , you know . You better come up with another number next time . " The march continued north . The only other problem occurred in La Jolla . Marcelino had turned the column of men from the beach and led them through a golf course . The sight of uniformed men , trudging across the greens and down the middle of the fairways soon disrupted play . The male players cursed the extra hazard and stormed off in search of the club manager . However , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and eagerly commented on the good looks of this sailor or that Marine . Finally the manager burst through the rough on the seventeenth hole and demanded an explanation . Fausto hurried over . " They do n't speak English . " " English hell ! I 'm calling the police . " " What did I tell you , " Evangelina called , setting herself down in a warm sandtrap . As the manager was about to leave , Mario zipped across the fairway in a flame-red cart . As usual he was dressed in black , this time wearing a purple tie . " Hey , man , you know there 's a twelve-time rapist runnin ' around your course ? Yeah , he could be anywhere . We 're just tryin ' to catch him . " Mario stretched his legs over the front of the cart , leaned back and clasped his hands behind his head . " Go on , tell that to the ladies . " " Who are you ? " the manager asked , the pink flush leaving his face . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you in charge ? " " Yes . " " Well , do what you have to do , but stay off the playing area ... at least the greens . Uh . . . what 's this rapist look like ? " Fausto hesitated , then looked to Mario for an answer . " You ca n't miss him , " Mario said . " He 's just a little guy . . . ' bout four feet tall . " " Four feet tall ? " " Hey , ese , we ai n't got time to waste . The vato 's really fast . " " Okay , just hurry up and find him , " the manager said , retreating into the rough . " Thank you , " Fausto said to Mario as they left the course . " Thank Carmela , she 's the one that told me where you were . "  | " How did she know ? " " Says you were talkin ' in your sleep ... something about the beach and La Jolla . " The march continued up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insisted on walking . " What you gon na do with them vatos ? " Mario asked . " Find them a place to live . " " How you gon na do that ? " " You 'll see . I ca n't tell you now because I 'm still thinking about it . " Fausto halted the march somewhere between Leucadia and Oceanside . " Look over there , " he shouted to the men . Beyond Interstate 5 , between endless rows of staked tomatoes , hundreds of other illegals waved their short-handled hoes , beckoning to the long line of men . In seconds the newcomers had torn off their uniforms and were rushing across the highway . Fausto watched them embrace , then waited while they talked . Finally one of the men left the field and returned to the highway . He was a young man with an easy , muscular walk . " Senor ? " he said , holding his oversized , Navy-issue shorts at the waist . " Yes , " Fausto said . " Senor , it 's not that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over . . . . " " Go on . " " The simple truth is that there are n't enough jobs to go around . " Fausto patted the man 's arm . " It 's better you discovered this from someone else . Maybe you 'll trust me more . " " We all thank you for what you 've done . " " Do n't thank me yet . You have n't heard what I 'm thinking . Go tell the others that if they do what I say , they 'll never have to work again . " Fausto paused . " No , maybe that 's an exaggeration , but at least you wo n't have to do this kind of work . " The young man was silent for a moment . Then he picked up a dry dirtclod , threw it against the asphalt curb and began to laugh through his teeth . " How ' bout me ? " Mario asked . Fausto continued . " Tell them to wash themselves , comb their hair , and when that 's done .... " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead , " Mario interrupted . " How you expect them to live without workin ' ? " " You do it , " Fausto said . " I 'm different . I was born here . " " Mario , where you were born has nothing to do with it . Now .. . where was I ? " " You were tellin ' him to drop dead . " " Hmm .... that 's not such a bad idea . " " You serious ? " " Look at David . He never complained . " Fausto turned to the young wetback . " When we get to where we 're going , all of you must pretend you 're dead . " " Dead ? " " Do n't move your eyes , do n't smile , and if you want to use the bathroom , do it when nobody 's looking . " " Is that all ? " the young man asked . " No . Whatever people want you to do , you must do it . Some of them will put you in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or maybe they 'll put you in a museum . Quien sabe ? But I do n't think you 'll have to worry . You 'll be too valuable . And do n't worry about food . No one will let you get skinny . " " What about our families ? " " Yeah , " Mario said , " what about their viejas ? " " One thing at a time , " Fausto said . " First go talk to the others , see what they think . " Fausto 's plan quickly spread throughout the fields . Everyone had questions , but no one spoke . They were too excited , and what they said might sound silly . Would they be given days off ? Would they be in California or some other place ? What if they got tired of playing dead ? " They say yes , " the young man announced , still holding onto his boxer shorts . " But they want to know where to wash . " Fausto pointed to Marcelino , who had been waiting in the shade of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Follow him the man with the flute . " The signal was given , and the army of wetbacks rose and started off toward Los Angeles . " Mario , " Fausto called , gesturing his friend closer , " I think I 'll ride with you . I 'm tired . "  | Mario pumped his foot on the cart 's accelerator , then hopped of and kicked one of the small , fat tires . " You ca n't , battery 's dead . " Fausto leaned on his staff and sighed , half-expecting his wife to whisper , " I told you so . " " Come on , " Mario said . " We can hitchhike. "  | NINE Did you take your pills ? " Evangelina asked . The three of them Evangelina , Fausto and Mario  --  had been picked up by two surfers in a beige and vermilion van . On both sides , under a seascape with a pink sun dropped on the horizon , were the finelettered words UNITED VANS BERDOO . Fausto moved the beer cans and wet suits aside and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was pitched in the rear so that they looked down on the two heads in front . " Well , did you ? " " Leave him alone , " Mario said , shaking one of the empty , twelveounce cans , then peering in the hole . " You stay out of this , " she ordered . Fausto moved his lips . Evangelina scooted forward and asked the driver to lower the stereo . " He ca n't hear you ! " Fausto shouted , " you 're dead . " " Then you tell him . I ca n't hear with all that noise . " " Mario , tell them to lower it . " " That ai n't a good idea , ese . They give us a ride , now we 're tellin ' them to keep it down . Naw , that ai n't cool . They could drop us off , then where 'd we be ? Took us two hours to get this ride . " " He 's right , Eva . " " What ? " " I took my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question , the one she had never received an answer to , was why was he trying to save the world ?  | " Eva , a few mojados is n't the world . " " But why wo n't you stay in bed and die like everyone else ? No , you have to go off to Peru and God knows where else . And now you 're trying to bring over all these mejicanos . " " What are we ? Chinese ? " " But why them ? Low-class nothings ... pura gentuzal ... maleducados ... campesinos .... " Fausto almost reminded her that he himself had been a street sweeper when they first saw each other . She and her father had driven by while he was scraping horse manure from the road . A young girl , seated stiffly in the back seat , she had waved to him then , and years later , after the revolution had taken her father , after she had walked to El Paso with only a suitcase and her good name , they had met again and were married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her , he was something more than a nothing . She had taught him everything . She would even have taught him to read , but he already knew . And the most important lessons were his bearing , his speech and his manners . " That 's what impresses , " she used to say . " It does n't matter that you 're a small man . Speak like a big man . " What could he say ? Should he try to explain ? " Campesinos , " she said , glancing out the tinted porthole of the van . " Why them ? " " Because ... I feel sorry for them . " Evangelina was silent . Perhaps she saw him still in the street , looking up and waving to the princess in the back seat of her father 's car . Fausto remembered the last time he had used those words . They had just arrived in Amecameca , a village near the volcano Popocatepetl . Evangelina said she wanted to sit in the sun on the plaza bench . " Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk around . I like these little towns . " " Fausto ? " " What ? " " Take care of Carmela . The last time you two went off she got sick from riding on that mule . " They walked away , entering a cobblestone street tilted toward the middle to form a gutter . " Tio , where we going ? " Carmela chewed one end of a purple , corn tortilla , warm and tightly rolled .  | " To see if we can rent some horses , like we did in Teocaltiche . Would you like that ? " Carmela nodded and finished her tortilla . At the edge of the village they asked about horses , but no one seemed to know who might have the animals . Further into the campo they met an old man seated on the rump of a burro following another burro loaded with dry cornstalks . Fausto spoke , and the man pointed with his thumb . " He has one horse , lives over there , a little ways beyond the arroyo , see over there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a roof , well , that man has a horse but I do n't think he 'll lend it to you , he 's a very jealous man , he wo n't even say hello to his neighbors he 's so jealous , pobrecito , it 's probably because he lost his first wife and two children . We think they died from eating rotten food , but I doubt if you 'll get the horse , because ever since she died he wo n't lend us anything . So you can try , but like I say he wo n't even say hello to us .... " Fausto thanked the farmer and continued alongside the arroyo . It was powder dry and deeply cut in the sides . At a place where it narrowed , he helped Carmela across and the two climbed the bank to the other side . The dogs kept barking , even when the woman came out the front doorway and began throwing rocks to scare them away . She was barefoot and kept wiping her hands on her skirt , waiting for Fausto to speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He asked her about the land , the broken , uncultivated land beyond the farm . The mountain seemed to begin its rise just beyond the farm . Before he could say more , she turned and rushed into the house . A wiry , hollow-cheeked man came out and respectfully asked if he could help them . From their clothes it was obvious the strangers were from the city . Fausto explained they were walking from the village and would like to cross his land . " Why ? " the man asked . " To see the mountain . " " And you ca n't see well enough from here ? " " We 'd like to get closer . . . . Now , if it does n't bother you . . . . " " Please , why not over there ? There 's plenty of land over there . And if you go that way , it 's a much better view . You ca n't see anything from here . "  | " But .... " " I 'm sorry , you ca n't cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Come on , Carmela . " " No ! You ca n't go that way either . " " Listen , no one is going to touch your land . " " Please , it 's dangerous . All those rocks you see over there are infested with poisonous spiders . The rocks are covered with holes , and that 's where the spiders make their nests . " Carmela watched the man become more and more excited , and although the Spanish words were spoken rapidly , even she could tell the spiders were probably an excuse . The dogs followed the strangers at a distance to the edge of the cultivated field . The man yelled to them and waved his hat , but his words were lost in the dogs ' barking . Fausto found a well-worn path which seemed to lead to the volcanic mounds on the other side of the crude rock-and-cactus wall . " Do n't believe what he said about the spiders , mijita . " " What about the horse ? " Carmela had worn her jeans and cowboy shirt . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The man ran diagonally across the dry furrows , then stumbled crazily , picked himself up in one motion and leaped over the wall . " Senor , " he said to Fausto , " dos pesitos . " He lowered his eyes and extended his hand . " No , I ca n't give you money . " The man insisted , pleading as the three walked quickly along the path . Finally Fausto told him to leave . " Everyone pays me two pesos .. . . " " I said no . " " Please , understand me . The government says I should watch this land . I have collected at least two pesos from anyone who comes this way . Please . . . I have a wife and children . Did you see them ? " " I do n't believe the government asked you to do this . " " Senor , it 's obvious you do n't live here . If you did , you would know . Look at the sky . It 's been this way for months . Not even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we live ? What do my family and I eat ? Please , a little tip , two little pesos .. . . " Fausto left him squeezing his straw-colored hat . " Who does that baboso think he is ? If he wants to beg , let him beg . But why does he  | lie ? " The two climbed onto the rocks . Fausto looked carefully into the holes and cracks but saw only gravel and clumps of dry grass . They sat down to rest , facing the mountain . For a long while he stared at the wisps of wind-blown snow drawn lightly around the peak , while Carmela threw stones across the field of hardened lava . " Sit down , " Fausto said , " I 'll tell you a story . " He popped his knuckles and Carmela hunched down to listen . " It 's about a poor man who dreamed he would marry the beautiful daughter of a king . Everyone thought he was crazy for having such a dream , and they laughed . Even the king laughed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in those days only a prince could marry the king 's daughter . But there was one person who did n't think he was crazy . It was the king 's daughter . She had seen the man and did n't laugh . At least not at first . She liked him because he told funny stories and because he made her feel more beautiful than she really was . " " Was she really pretty ? " " Yes , mijita. . . very pretty . " " I bet she was n't as pretty as Tia Eva . " " Almost .... Anyway , one day the king found them together and said he would have the man killed if they were ever caught together again . So the princess and the poor man ran away . But they did n't hide , they were n't ashamed of what they had done . They went to a place where everyone could see them , up to the top of those two volcanoes . " " I only see one . " " It 's there , on the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , the princess died from the cold . " " What happened to him ? " " Oh , he 's still there , waiting for her to wake up . " " Wo n't he die , too ? " " Maybe .... " When they started back to the village , going the long way around the farmer 's land , Carmela 's sneakers lost their grip on the rock and she slipped into a large pit which was level at the bottom . " Tio , look what I found ! " Three splintered crosses stuck out of the ground at different angles .  | " Do n't touch them , Carmela . Let me have your hand . " Fausto spread himself on the smooth rock , reached for the hand and pulled her up . " Tio , is someone buried there ? " " Let 's go , mijita . Eva will be waiting for us . We 've explored enough for one day . " " They always put crosses on dead people ? " " Carmela , do n't ask so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were walking the way they had come . At the house Fausto stopped and called in the open doorway . " Is your husband here ? " he asked the woman . " Give him this . " The woman retreated into the room , waving her hand . " Take the money , it 's ten pesos . . . . " She spat on the hardened dirt floor and turned away . Fausto placed the coin on the ground where she could see it and slowly walked backwards toward his niece . " Why did you pay him ? " Carmela asked when they had left the house . " I felt sorry for him , " her uncle said , almost in a whisper , but what he did n't say was that he was ashamed of himself . " Is this okay ? " the driver of the van said , pulling onto the shoulder . Mario hung his head between the two bucket seats . " Hey , ca n't you take us a little more ? " " How far ? " " Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh . . . ' bout ten miles . " " Ten miles ! This ai n't a taxi . Who 's gon na pay my gas ? " " Hey , my old man 's had two strokes in the last week . He ca n't take no more . " " Then how come he 's walking around ? " " I 'm takin ' him to the hospital . " " From Oceanside ? " " Yeah , man ... he 's goin ' for some kinda brain transplant . " " Aw , come on ! What kind of shit 's that ? " " Okay , do n't believe me . You wan na kill my old man , you just did it . " " Alright , take it easy . What 's the turnoff ' ? " " Elysian Park . Know where that is ? " " No , but just tell me when to stop . "  | TEN When Carmela returned from the drive-in theater , she found her uncle burning with fever . He was in bed , fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As she untied the shoelaces , she noticed his socks were mismatched and his shoes were on the wrong feet . She covered him with the bedspread and rushed out of the house . At Cuca 's she banged on the door , then on the bedroom window , until the snoring stopped and the old woman peeked through the blinds . " Cuca , it 's my Tio ! He 's burning up . " " Okay , okay , let me put something on . " Carmela waited outside , twisting and bobbing as if she had to urinate . " Fever ? " Cuca said , coming out with her sewing bag of medicines . " Well , we 'll see . " A fragile , white-haired woman with wrinkles running everywhere across her face , Cuca was used to being called in the middle of the night . Sometimes even her worst cures succeeded at night , whereas most of her failures occurred during the day after she had her coffee . She paused at the corner , looked up and tested the overcast sky with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking . But he wo n't die . . . at least not now . " At the house Cuca squeezed a cut lemon into half a glass of water and stirred in two tablespoons of Karo corn syrup . Fausto drank the mixture and asked for more . Cuca refused , saying the remedy called for only half a glass . " Now , " she told Carmela , " go ask Smaldino to bring two buckets of ice . " Carmela left and returned with the fat fishseller ; his colorless  | flannel pajamas had coffee stains at the top and were torn at the crotch . Cuca thanked him for the favor , and Smaldino set the buckets down without a word , turned and stumbled into the wall . " Carmela , take him home . I do n't think he 's awake . " When the two had gone , Cuca opened her kit and removed several , plastic garbage-disposal bags . She filled them with ice and twisted paper-covered wires around the tops . Then she tucked one bag in each of the sick man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . Fausto opened one eye and winked . " Cuca . " " Yes ? " " It wo n't work . " " I know , but it makes Carmela feel better . " " If you see my wife , tell her I 'm on my way . " " Not so quick , compadre . Take your time . . . al cabo , what 's your hurry ? " " You think this is really it ? " " Who knows ? It all depends on what you 're thinking . The mind usually controls these things . It may last a few days or a few hours . But it 's no use worrying about it . " " I suppose you 're right . " " If it makes you feel better , I 'll tell everyone to come by in the morning . I 'm sure they 'd like to say goodbye . " " Cuca ? " " Yes . " " Can you put some ice between my legs . . . ? " " Like this ? " " Higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cuca had witnessed many deaths , and it was always a pleasure to see a bit of fire still wriggling around beneath the burned-up coals . She reached for her bag and rose to leave . " Fausto , I 'll see you in the morning . Can you wait till I come back ? " " I think so . " " Good . Now rest , and try not to get too excited . The ice should bring the temperature down , but you have to cooperate . " After she left , Marcelino entered . He had been waiting in the bathroom and appeared distressed . " Have you forgotten ? " he said . " Nothing can make you fall . " Fausto shifted the ice-bag . " Go away , I 'm tired . "  | " The Mexicans are waiting . " " Tell them to go back . It 's no use . I ca n't help anyone ... not like this . " " Think of what you could show them . . . a man with all your knowledge . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them how movies are made , remember ? " " Marcelino , go watch your alpacas . " " No , I 'm staying until you get up . " " How can I get up ? " " Help them . " " Go away , I ca n't even help myself . " " They 're waiting for you in the river . " " Do they look dead ? " " They 're trying , they 're dying of hunger and cold . Some of them do n't even have clothes . There 's one man who started shaking so much he said he 'd rather be alive than dead . " Fausto pulled the sheet over his head , but as he did so one of the bags under his arm slipped off the bed . " Could you get that for me ? " Marcelino remained standing at the foot of the bed . " If you ever die , " he said , " they 're going to say you were a coward . They 'll say you made it up . You never went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never explored the jungle , you never did what you said you did . They 'll say you abandoned your men , you escaped .... " " No ! " " Yes . " Fausto sat up and glared at his young friend . Who was he to throw out such insults ? A shepherd ... ca n't even find his way home . All he can do is play that flute . " You 're not even a good coward , " Marcelino said . " A good coward would have died years ago . You should n't have even been born . Like my Uncle Celso used to say , life is a game for winners , not losers . " " What 's that supposed to mean ? " " I do n't know , but he used to say it . " Fausto flung his pillow at the bedpost . Marcelino ducked , but as he rose from his crouch , an ice-bag crashed into his chest and he collapsed on the floor . " I 'll show you who 's a coward , " Fausto said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the figure on the floor . " Come on , we 've got  | things to do . " " Just a moment . . . I . . . I ca n't breathe . " " Aha ! Well , you can learn a few games yourself . Vamos . " Fausto adjusted the partial on the right side of his mouth , yanked his pith helment down to his ears and . strode out of the room . Stopping in the kitchen , he lifted the dishtowel covering the cage and poked a finger at the sleepy , arthritic bird . " Take care of the house , Tico . You 're in charge now . " The parakeet ruffled its feathers and seemed to shrug . Fausto gave him the remainder of the anis and said goodbye with a friendly tap on the back that left the bird sputtering by one claw above the water dish . Crossing into the living room , Fausto heard his wife chuckle . " Are n't you forgetting something ? " she said . " Ah . . . yes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . And here 's your shirt . You might as well look neat . " Fausto steadied himself against the television while his wife lifted his leg . " Now the other side , " she said , " that 's it . " She pulled up the zipper , careful not to pinch anything , then pushed the button through the hole . He expected her to say , " What would you do without me ? " But this time Evangelina tied his cape , slowly , as if it were the last knot and simply said , " I 'll be waiting for you . " Marcelino opened the door , and the two men stepped out . The Peruvian then handed Fausto the elegant , homemade scroll . He solemnly unrolled the parchment and began to read . " I , Don Fausto Tejada , respectful servant and emissary of Nuestra Ciudad la Reina de los Angeles , hereby undertake this journey , fitter for bodies less blasted with misfortune , for men of greater ability , so that if Your Grace wills it , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not in quest of riches but of the true seed and pulse of life .... " No , he decided , it would n't do. , It 's one thing to enter the Valley of Mexico at the head of an army , or to lay my staff on the glory of Peru . .. but it 's quite a different thing to be cast into the arms of a thousand starving men . The scroll would only make me look ridiculous . If I 'm going to help them , I 'll need more than words . " Marcelino , play something , " Fausto said as they turned the  | corner and started down the slope toward the river . " Anything .. . something that will help me think . " Marcelino obliged , keeping the sound low so it would n't wake the neighbors. " ... fitter for bodies less blasted with misfortune . . . . " Fausto shook his head . " It 's too bad , it 's not everyday people can hear language like that . Well , maybe some other time .... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Fausto had no idea where or how to find a solution . He recalled once before he had been in a similar situation . He was crossing the desert with a truckload of encyclopedias . Somewhere between Coachella and the Salton Sea the road stopped . He remembered he was so angry he jumped down and started kicking the sand where the road disappeared . Despite the noonday heat , he kept kicking the sand and cursing the men who had built such a disaster . After a while other trucks and cars arrived . The people saw what he was doing , and they began to do the same . By evening they had kicked sand all the way to Indio . But even then the problem still was n't solved . Fausto had worn holes in the toes of his shoes , and the only shoestore open was sold out of his size . No , he would have to think this out carefully . " Marcelino , that 's enough music . " As they neared the levee , Fausto noticed the lights of Mrs. Renteria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and took a closer look . The mojados , it seemed , had made themselves at home . Mrs. Renteria was serving them as fast as they could finish a plate and pass it on to the next hungry mouth . Apparently Smaldino had emptied his load of fish at the back door , and Tiburcio and his sons had made a barbecue pit using an old , chain-link fence stretched across the backyard over the sunken plot of pansies and geraniums . " I can always grow more flowers , " Mrs. Renteria explained , " but these men only have one life to live . " Fausto nodded and squeezed into the kitchen . Mrs. Noriega and several of the other women were busy kneading the dough and shaping it into football-size loaves . In the bathroom Cuca was whipping up enough eggs and milk to satisfy an army . And it was only when the foaming ponche rose over the bathtub did she realize she might have made more than enough . Nothing that could be eaten was left in the house , nor in the houses for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wandered back to the river . Mrs. Renteria almost offered them her heart but  | then changed her mind when she remembered someone would have to give them breakfast . " Fausto , " she said , " do n't you think they should be inside ? If only I had more room in the house . But you saw how it was . I could hardly move . " " How about the church , " Mrs. Noriega suggsted , moving her rosary hand up a bead . " I 've been praying all night for God to help us . " That wo n't do no good , " Tiburcio said . " All they can do in a church is pray . No , senora , they did n't come all the way from Mexico to pray . " " At least they wo n't be cold . " Tiburcio looked at Fausto . " What were you going to do with them ? You 're the one that brought them here . " " I had an idea , but now I do n't know .... I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , we 've got to put them somewhere , or they 'll be arrested . I know , it 's happened to me . " " Mario ! " Fausto shouted , startling the women who were dozing in chairs by the kitchen table . Mario pushed himself up from the bathtub . He had been rinsing the ring of ponche from around the top . " Mario , tell them to come back . We 'll take them to the theater . " " What theater ? " " The Los Feliz theater , the one they closed last year . Can you open it ? " " Sure , but what you gon na do when you get ' em in ? I know them vatos . They 're gon na want a movie . " " I 'll worry about that . Just do what I said . " " What 'll I tell ' em ? " " Say they 're going to a show . " " What 's it called ? They 're gon na ask what 's it called . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vida y muerte ? " Tiburcio suggested . " No , " Mrs. Renteria said , " that 's too depressing . You need something that will make them happy .... " " I know , " Mrs. Noriega said , " la vida de Jesus . " No one answered , then Tiburcio said the title should have some mystery to it , maybe something about a man with a mask .  | " No , what you need is something with a woman , " Mario said . " Yeah , who 's going to play the woman ? " " You mean , we got ta put the thing on ? " " Sure , it 's easy , just think of something . " Cuca suggested a show about Burma . " Where 's that ? " someone asked . " Next to India . " " Why not Los Angeles ? " " Hollywood . . . . " " Glendale . " " Que Glendale ! Maravilla ! " " Boyle Heights . . . . " " The Paladium . " " The zoo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by , Fausto winked to Marcelino and shouldered his way through the crowd of excited neighbors . " They 'll follow us in a little while , " he said . " Once they start talking like that , it 's no use staying . No one listens anyway . "  | ELEVEN The show was more than Fausto had dreamed was possible . Popcorn , pirulis and candied apples were passed along the rows , from aisle to aisle ; somehow the lights were made to work , and the children quickly cleaned off the stage by skating back and forth on pieces of gunny sacks . Fausto sat in the second row . He signaled for Mario to draw the curtains back  --  waterstained and torn at the bottom  --  then motioned to Marcelino to play an opening tune . For a moment the mojados were silent , waiting for something called " The Road to Tamazunchale . " One boy , seated three seats from Fausto , was especially quiet . His hometown was Tamazunchale , and he had never heard of a show with such a name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town of Terrazas , had figured in a movie he once saw , and he even recognized a hill near his house  --  but never , he had never seen a show all about the place that had given him birth . It was a great honor , something he would tell his mother and father . After some difficulty with the guide ropes , the curtains parted and Tiburcio emerged from a cloud of snow . Or smog , no one could tell . He was dressed in a black suit , and the white collar of his stiff , studded shirt was turned up so that the plastic stays jabbed into his jowls , giving his face the appearance of a retired circus-master . " Psst , your collar , " his wife called from the band pit . " Hermanos , " he said in a loud voice , ignoring his wife and stepping to the edge of the stage , " we have called the show you are about to see Tamazunchale . . . " " Psst ! The road .... " " Yes , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason . You see , whenever things go bad , whenever we do n't like someone ,  | whoever it is . . . our sons , our wife , our compadres or comadres . . . we simply send them to Tamazunchale . We 've never really seen this place , but it sounds better than saying the other , if you know what I mean . Uh , before I go further , is there anyone here from Tamazunchale ? " The boy in the second row swallowed and dropped his hand into the popcorn . " Good , " Tiburcio said . " Otherwise , we would have to change the name of our show . . . to Teocaltiche . . . Panindicuaro or something like that . " He waited for the whistling and laughter to die , then continued . Under his wife 's coaching , he rambled to the end of his speech , explaining to his audience how they were all either coming from or going to Tamazunchale . " And we are too , " he added . " We may not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everyone is on that road . Si , compadres , everyone ! But as you 'll see , Tamazunchale is not what you think it is .... " " Psst , hurry up . " " Lady , " Tiburcio said , nodding to his wife , " and gentlemen . . . our show ! " Tiburcio retreated to a burst of applause . The footlights clicked on , and someone , probably Robert , Smaldino 's eldest son , hobbled out from the side , a hoe in one hand and wearing a shabby pith helmet , a moth-eaten cape and baggy trousers . Black , crayon wrinkles were drawn above and below his eyes and at both sides of his mouth . As he came into the light , a small girl in pigtails skipped by , then returned with a puzzled expression . " Tio , " she said , " where are you going ? " " Tamazunchale , " the old man replied . " Can I go too ? " " No , mijita . I only have one ticket . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girl 's cheek with his palm . " Well , maybe they 'll let you go free . " " Can I bring my frog ? " " Of course , I know they do n't sell frog tickets . " As soon as they were seated on the bus , the driver began collecting tickets . The old man handed him his . " One more , " the driver said , " the little girl .... "  | " Can she ride on my lap ? She wo n't bother . " The man glanced at the other passengers . " Alright , but the frog stays . " One more passenger was let on , a woman with a neat pompadour wave , a shoulder-padded suit and white gloves . Fausto stood from his second-row seat in the audience and shouted his wife 's name . " Sit down ! " " I ca n't see .... " " Shut up , I ca n't hear . " Carmela , acting as usherette , hurried down the aisle , waving her flashlight , and asked her uncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suitcases , boxes and paper sacks were tucked under the seats or onto the overhead racks , the bus began to shake itself of the cold , gnashing its gears , finally lumbering onto the main road to Tamazunchale . On the bumper were the words EL DIABLO NEGRO . For a while the passengers appeared content to gaze through the windows , flip through magazines , stare ahead or simply close their eyes . Eventually the heat of the engine rose into the seats of those in the rear , the sunlight burned through the roof , and the familiar odor of gassy meals was loosed on the people toward the front . Evangelina , already squirming , was the first to complain . Gripping the seat rail with both gloved hands , she rose and demanded that the driver control his passengers . When he ignored her pleas , she asked to be let off . Fausto could n't blame her , for even he could smell the bomb , seated where he was in the audience . The woman stepped down and pointed a white finger at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , you did it ! " " So ? It 's my bus . " The audience laughed , and as the bus lurched forward , a bag bulging with fish toppled from the overhead rack . A young woman cradling a baby shrieked at the shower of scaly things dropping down her back , under her bodice and into her hair . Ignoring his mother 's hysterics , the baby quietly began sucking on the head of a mackerel . Smaldino , dressed as Smaldino , apologized his way to the front of the bus and was ordered to leave . Someone heaved a fish at him , but it hit the driver . Smaldino grinned and jumped to the ground . Jess was the next passenger to leave the bus , but it was n't because he wanted to . While he was rereading his only copy of Mechanics  | Illustrated , Cuca , the director of the show , motioned from behind the curtain for everyone to leave . It was a rest-stop , and they were supposed to act like tired , stretching , yawning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stage , " Cuca whispered to the driver . " He 's ruining everything . " The driver pushed his cap back and approached the lone figure on the bus . " Get off . " " Why ? " Jess asked , keeping his finger on the page . " Do n't ask , " the driver said in Jess 's ear . " Hey , I thought I was just going to sit . " " Shhh ! Get off . " " No , I 'm reading . " The driver grabbed him by the arm , but Jess , remembering his wrestling holds , jabbed the man in the ribs , feinted and tried to trip him off his feet . The mojados seemed to like what they saw  --  two men fighting like stags , head to head , then like bears , chest to chest , finally like men , wheeling all over the stage and flailing at each other like wild animals . On the bus the neat rows of foldup chairs folded and fell , the mock sides of the roof caved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steering wheel collapsed . With the help of the other male passengers , the wrestling champ was dethroned and carried into the alley behind the theater . While everyone in the audience was laughing , Mario pulled the curtains together , and the props were set up again . So far the show was a success . The second scene was more of the first . Mrs. Renteria , playing Mrs. Renteria , had to leave when her companion died . The passengers offered their sympathy , and the driver even covered the dead man 's face with his own jacket . " Thank you , " the spinster said , " he 'll need something to keep him warm . " " Do n't mention it . " " You would n't have another pair of pants , would you ? His are wet . " " These are all I 've got , and I ca n't drive without them . " " Please ? " " I 'm sorry , I ca n't . " Mrs. Renteria started to cry , the dead man moaned under the jacket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hand  | over his pants . Soon the men were all chanting , " Pan-ta-lones ! Pan-ta-lones ! " The driver turned his back to the passengers , removed his wallet , comb , coins and nailclipper from the pockets , then unbuckled the pants and slipped them off . As he handed them over , the children on the stage giggled . " Thank you , " Mrs. Renteria said , and everyone applauded the man 's generosity . Not long afterward , the bus on its way again , Mrs. Noriega announced she was leaving . They had gone far enough , and she would walk the rest of the way . " Only God knows if we lie , " she said , facing the others . " He knows when people lie . I promised him I would walk , and a promise to God is the most sacred promise of all . It is more sacred than the promises we make to the saints , and yes , even more sacred , more serious than the promises we make to our holy mother in heaven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of you can swear . . . . " " Senora , " the driver said , " I promised to drive the bus to Tamazunchale . We 're behind schedule as it is . Could you ... ? " " God bless you all , " Mrs. Noriega said . " In the name of the Father , the Son and the Holy Ghost . . . . " One by one , as the road neared its end , the passengers left the bus . A woman with five children thought she recognized her home and asked to be let off . Two drunks in the rear fell off their chairs and were left with their faces in the dust . Another man , swearing his ancestors had created the sun , remained in the desert to discover the truth . Everyone had their reasons . Even the driver , as they came into view of the town , stopped the bus and said he could go no further . The old man with the little girl complained . They were the only passengers left , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Are you coming back ? " he shouted as the young man hopped down and darted into the field of maguey plants . " You can walk the rest of the way . I ca n't drive into that town without my pants . I 'm sorry , but everybody knows who I am . " The old man shrugged and pushed up on his staff . " Vamonos , mijita , it 's getting late . " Cuca told Mario to lower the lights , and the twilight of Tamazunchale instantly descended . Then the curtains closed , and the audience was silent , uncertain if the show was over .  | Backstage , the chairs were removed , and Tiburcio and his sons quickly propped up the set for the last scene . Between two arched , cardboard trees , bending toward the middle , they placed a plywood ramp leading up to the sky . One of the smaller boys climbed up a ladder and scissor-locked his legs around a rafter . Then he dangled a small white cloud from a string . " Ready ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Yeah , " the boy said . The old man and the girl took their positions at the front of the stage , and the curtains were swept back . Something near the ceiling snapped , and Mario was left with the rope in his hands . " Shh , quiet ! " Cuca said , stamping her foot . " Tio , " the girl started , straining her eyes over the unwadded sheet of paper , " I 'm afraid . " " Do n't worry , we 're almost there . " The two figures walked in circles for a while , then the girl tugged at her uncle 's cape again . " Why are we going to this place ? " The old man sat down at the bottom of the ramp . " To see what it 's like . " " Is it a bad place ? " " Who said that ? " " There 's a boy who sits next to me in school , and he 's always using that word . The other day the teacher heard him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour . The teacher really got mad because he even wrote it on the wall . But that 's nothing , I see it in the bathroom all the time . " " You think your teacher is right ? " " I do n't know , she says we should wash our mouth out with soap if we ever say it . But once I heard her say it to another teacher . I watched her for a long time , and she never washed her mouth . " " Do n't you think it 's silly to wash your mouth with soap ? " " Yeah , toothpaste is better . " " Mijita . . . everyone should go to Tamazunchale . " " What 's it like ? " " Like any other place . Oh , a few things are different . . . if you want them to be . " " What do you mean ? " " Well , if you see a bird , you can talk to it , and it 'll talk back . If you want something , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apple , think about it  | and you might be hanging from a tree or you might be held in someone 's hand , maybe your own . " " Could I be a flower ? " " You can be the sun . " " How ' bout the moon ? " " You can be the stars . . . . " " What if I want to be me again ? " " Mijita , you can be a song of a million sounds , or you can be a little girl listening to one sound . " " Tio , you think I 'll see my friends ? " " All of them . " " Lucy and Sally ? They 're my best friends . " " Lucy and Sally . " " Will they have to go home ? " " Not unless their mother calls them . " " How long will we stay ? " " As long as you want . . . forever . . . it does n't matter to me . " The little girl sneaked a look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we going to die ? " " No one dies in Tamazunchale . " " No one ? " " Well , some people do , but they 're only pretending . " " Like in the movies ? " " Not exactly . They do die , they 're even buried and people cry , and some of the men become very drunk .... " " Like Tiburcio ? " " Si , mijita . " " Then what happens to the dead people ? " " They usually see how stupid it is to die , so they come out of the earth and do something else . " " Do we have to die if we do n't want to ? " " Not unless you 're curious . That 's what happens to most people . They have to try it once . But do n't worry about that now . You 'll have lots of time to think about it later . " The old man wiped his brow and tucked the script under his cape . He glanced down at the frightened little eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Tio , why did n't we stay home like my Tia Eva said ? " " Because Tamazunchale is our home . Once we 're there , we 're free ,  | we can be everything and everyone . If you want , you can even be nothing . " " Will I have to go to school ? " " Never . " " Okay . " The old man stood and faced the sky . " Shall we go ? " " Tio , what about the snow ? Yesterday you said you 'd take me to the mountains to see the snow . " " Mijita , you can be a snowball . " " Really ? " " I 'll make you myself . " The little girl laughed and skipped up the ramp . " Wait , " the old man said , pivoting around his staff and gesturing to the audience . " Excuse me , but maybe you would like to come with us . . . ? " The first one up on the stage was the Tamazunchale boy ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ramp . A few other followed him , then more , and in minutes the theater seats were empty . The column , led by the old man and the girl , quickly formed and wound up into the sky . Fausto could see that gradually some of the mojados were dipping to the right or to the left , but most continued forward , and eventually all were lost , diminished , gone between the horizon and the stars . Alone in the second row of the theater , Fausto clapped and clapped until his hands were sore .  | TWELVE Why is he clapping his hands ? " ' " Looks like he 's having a seizure . " " ' Do n't say that ! You think he 's crazy or something ? " " I did n't say that . I just said he looks like fever 's got him . You ever seen anybody shake like that ? " " I did . " " What are you , a doctor ? " " No , but I saw a guy shaking like that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Shh ! Keep it down . " " Hey , man . . . . " " Do n't call me man . " " Alright , esa .... " " Stop it ! You think you 're a pachuco or something ? " " Relax . . . . " " What about the guy you saw ? What happened to him ? " " Yeah , that 's all I was gon na say . Let ' im tell us what it was . " " Maybe we should go downstairs . What if he hears us ? " " He 's okay , probably like a good story . " " That 's it , he 's dying , and you men tell stories . " " What else can we do ? " " Pray for him .... " " I already called a doctor . " " What did he say ? " " Not much . He says the coughing 's probably from emphesyma , he ca n't move because of his heart , and the fever might be from a cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shakes ? "  | " Is n't he coming ? " " He 's dead . " " No , the doctor . " " He said he 'll be right over as soon as he can get away . " " Pinche doctors , that 's what happened to my old man . The ambulance would n't even take him . " " Lower your voice . " " What for ? It 's the truth . " " You 'll wake him up . I think he 's sleeping now , he 's not clapping his hands anymore . " " You should all be praying . I suppose nobody called the priest . " " Could you , senora ? I forgot . " " I thought so . " " Tell him to hurry . " " You , all of you can pray , that 's what you can do . " " Si , senora . " " Pray for his soul . " " Si , senora .... " " Now tell us the story . " " It was my buddy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , over there they bury their dead in caves . " " What were you doing there ? " " Do you have to talk so loud ? You 'll wake him up . " " Let ' im finish . " " They put them in these caves , then they put these big bottles of sake .... " " What 's that ? " " I thought you were n't listening ? " " Leave her alone . Sake 's wine , they make it out of rice . It 's supposed to help the dead on their way to heaven . " " So what happened ? " " We climbed into this cave , me and Bagus .... " " Bagus ? " " That was his name , Charlie Bagus . He said lots of people in his town had names like that . I was always with the other Mexicans in , the platoon , but I do n't know , we were being hit pretty hard and  | somehow I got stuck with Bagus . But he was a nice guy , always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only way you could get him mad was to mess up his hair . " " What about the cave ? " " Oh , so we were hiding in this cave . For four days we stayed in there , waiting for our guys to come and get us . Only thing that kept us alive was all that sake . But the third day I got bit by a scorpion . I thought I 'd die . Bit me right on my . . . to sabes , right here . " " What were you doing , digging holes with it ? " " I was pissing on the dead . Yeah , you 'll do anything when you 're drunk . " " Sounds perverted . " " Hey , watch your uncle . " " Anything 's possible in a war . " " Still sounds perverted . " " So there I am , crying about my bite . The whole thing got big as my arm . " Wow ! " " Heavy , man . " " But that was n't nothing compared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' cause he got the shakes like I 've never seen . All I could do was rub him down with sake . When the place was cleared and I dragged him out , they had to take him away in a strait jacket . Later they told me he died . " " That 's gross . " " Well , people do die . " " I mean you pissing on the bodies . " " Just bones . What do they know ? " " Yeah , what 's a bunch of bones ? " " I 'll tell you another story , better than that one . " " Talk downstairs . " Carmela wiped her uncle 's brow and asked Mario to wet another washcloth with cold water . Smaldino pulled Tiburcio aside and asked about the other story , which was also about the war and him being the only survivor of a landing craft that was bombed before they hit the shore . Tiburcio had saved himself because he was the first one off . " Shhhh ! " " What can you say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blown to hell . "  | " Shhhhhhhhh ! " When the new priest arrived , Carmela asked him what happened to the regular priest . " I 'm the substitue , " the young man said . " Father Jaime 's ill . By the way , would all of you mind leaving for a few minutes ? I 'd like to be alone for the absolution . " " Mind if I stay ? " Mario asked . " Are you immediate family ? " " His son . " " His son ? I was n't told he had a son . The lady who brought me here said he only had a niece . " " Then why 'd you ask ? I bet you like to see people lie . " " This is no time to argue . Please , move over by the door . " " What if I do n't ? " " Mario ! Leave the father alone . " " Miss , will you please ask him to move ? " " Mario , let 's go . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like your Tio would want me to . Ai n't that right , Mister Fausto ? " Fausto slowly raised his lids and winked with his good eye . " See , what 'd I tell you ? " " Okay . . . but please move out of the light . " " What for ? " " Mario , stay back like he says . " " En nomine , patri  --  " " Do n't gim me none of that mambo zambo shit . I wan na know what you 're sayin ' . " " Miss , can you please control him ? " " Hey , you know what , ese ? I bet you do n't believe all that stuff . Right ? " The priest continued , trying to ignore the youthful shadow blocking the light . " You 're all the same , " Mario said . " They did that to my dad . . . and what good did it do him ? Nothin ' . He still died .... " Carmela coaxed Mario into the hallway and told him the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He 's not going to save him . He 's praying for his soul . " " Soul , shit ! That 's just a word . Man . . . I mean , Carmela . . . what would you do if there was n't no such thing ? What would you do ? "  | " I do n't think anybody knows if there is or there is n't . Nobody really knows . " " I mean , let 's say you knew . Let 's say God told you . " " Do n't be silly . " " I mean what if he came down on his horse and .... " " His horse ? " " Then his cow , I do n't care . What if he stood right here and said hi , it 's me , the big chingon , and I 'm tellin ' you all this soul stuff is a pile of caca . What would you do ? " " Mario , go downstairs . I do n't think you 're funny . " " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a simple question . What would you do ? " " I do n't know . . . think about it I suppose , maybe ask my tio . " " Right ! And you know what he 'd say ? He 'd say God was right . " " How do you know ? " " He told me . " " My do or God ? " " Him , your uncle , the old man lyin ' on the bed in there . See , that 's why I was givin ' the padrecito a hard time . If he knew what your uncle was thinkin ' , he would n't be givin ' him no lost rite . " " Last . " " Hey , you know what I mean . " When the priest finished , Fausto again opened his eyes , smiled and gave the young man a blessing of his own . " Thank you , Father , " Carmela said in the hallway . She followed him downstairs and walked him to the door . " He 's a strange man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could have confessed , but maybe I 'm wrong . " " No , you 're probably right . He likes to play games . " " That 's a serious game . " " I know , Father . . . his soul and all that . " " All that ? There 's nothing more serious than the salvation of the soul . " " I 'll tell him , Father . " As the priest was leaving , Doctor Ramirez arrived , followed by Cuca with her bag of medicines . " He 's upstairs in bed , doctor . " " Fine , this wo n't take long . " " Cuca , would you mind waiting until he 's through ? "  | " No , I 've got all day . Besides , first come , first serve . " " Thanks . " " Carmela , do you have anything to eat ? I 'm hungry . " " Sure , if those two in the kitchen have n't finished what there is Check over the refrigerator , there should be a box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one to the bird ? I 'll be up with the doctor . " Doctor Ramirez was briefer than the priest . He poked thermometer under Fausto 's tongue , took his blood pressure , the listened to his heart and lungs . " Want me to call the hearst ? " Mario asked . " That wo n't be necessary , and please , lower your voice . " " It do n't bother him . " " It bothers me . " The doctor read the temperature and nodded . " Is n't there something you can do ? " Carmela asked . " I 'll write you a prescription . Give him one every half hour . " " Hey , doc , I think he 's tellin ' you somethin ' . " Doctor Ramirez turned and saw the bony finger wagging a feeble no above the blanket . " Do as you wish , " the doctor said , closing his bag . " Here 's the prescription , and call if you want me to certify cause of death . " " Thank you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't done nothin ' . " " Who 's he ? " " A friend of my uncle 's . " " A friend ? " " Yeah , do n't I look like a friend ? " " Yes , yes . . . as I said , just call if you need me . " " Puto . " " Mario ! Control yourself . . . . Doctor , I 'll go down with you . " " I can manage . You better stay with the boy . I think he 's upset . ' In the kitchen Cuca was making a ponche in the blender fo Tiburcio and Smaldino . She . had been telling them about her years a a midwife in the Chihuahua sierra . Whenever Cuca loosened up , nc one , except maybe Fausto , could tell a better story . She had jus finished describing the birth of what everyone was certain would bl the devil himself . But the baby was unimportant , Cuca said , the little girl was normal . What was strange were the parents . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nose , ears and parts of her fingers ii  | little glass jars , and her most private part she managed to save in an envelope . As for the father , he looked retarded , but he was n't . People made him that way . He crawled around outside his hut digging up roots and stealing chickens from the houses down below in the valley . The people had already cut off one hand when he was a child , but that did n't stop his stealing . He said he worked with the devil , and everyone would run whenever they saw this man crawling into the town . " Are n't you afraid they 'll cut off your other hand , I asked him . He laughed and held up a devil 's suit he made out of a tablecloth and some stolen rags . Then he said if I ever told anyone , he 'd put on his real suit and come down to get me . " " Did you ever tell ? " Tiburcio asked . " That night , I think , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Nothing . " " They did n't catch him ? " " They knew all along . They said they felt sorry for him and his wife . And what 's a few chickens ? Everyone has a right to a few chickens . " Cuca 's next story was about another town . A woman was dying in childbirth . " Cuca ! " Carmela called from the top of the stairs , " the doctor 's gone . You can come up now . " " I 'll be there , let me finish this first . " " Please , the doctor said he 's . . . . " " Carmela , he 's waited this long , he can wait until I finish my story . " " Hurry , please ! " The baby was born , Cuca said , and the mother lived . But the little creature was a hermaphrodite . " What 's that ? " Smaldino asked . " Boy and girl . " " Twins ? " " No , " Tiburcio said , describing with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . and a boy part . " " Oh . " Cuca placed the blender with the ponche on the table and continued . The father became so angry after he saw his child that he demanded she make it a boy . " Sew it up , he said . Do something , but make it a boy . "  | " You ca n't do that , " Smaldino said . " Yeah , " Tiburcio added , " how could you be sure which thing wa the one it used ? " " I do n't think you can tell , " Cuca said . " But this man had a rifle a my back , and I 'm sure he would have used it if I did n't think o something . " " Cuca ! " Carmela shouted again , " I think my do wants to see you . " Alright , I 'm coming . " " So what did you do ? " Tiburcio asked . " Guess . " " I do n't know . " " Me neither . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about them . Cuca said she told the father he was right , it was a boy . " How could you tell ? " " I could n't , now let me finish . . . I told the man he had two choice He could cut off the boy 's penis or ignore the vagina . No ! he said , could never do that to my own son . " " Me neither . " " So I told him he could wait until the boy was old enough t understand , then explain to him that some people are born with tw things and some are born with three . " Smaldino swallowed . " Three ? " " Your asshole , " Tiburcio said . " Oh , yeah .... " " Who would look at the boy anyway , I told him . The only peop that knew were him , his wife and me . And I was leaving . " " What if the boy wanted to get married ? " " So ? It 's not impossible . " " And what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , that 's the trouble with two . You do n't look at the goo side . Imagine how much fun it would be . " " I do n't know , " Tiburcio said . " Yeah , I 'll stick to my fish . " " Now , " Cuca said , moving into the living room , " let 's see what can do for Fausto . " Cuca . " " What ? " " No , I wo n't need it . " Fausto clapped his hands twice as she entered . His eyes we  | closed , so she knew he was either joking or dreaming . Carmela stood beside her . " Can you do something ? " " I did n't come to cure him . All I can do is talk to him and be here when he dies . " " She 's right , " Mario said . " She 's not a magician . " " I just thought . . . oh , never mind . " " Stay , " Cuca said . " He knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room with a pineapple-upsidedown cake and a bag of avocadoes . Mrs. Renteria had left them for Fausto . . . " in case he was hungry . " " Leave it in the kitchen , " Carmela said . " All right if we eat some of the cake ? " Smaldino asked . " Sure . " " Save some for me , " Mario said . Tiburcio stared for a moment at his dying friend , then moved the cake beneath the scrawny nose . " Just want to let him smell it . It 's his favorite . " " Why do n't we play a little music , " Smaldino suggested . " He always liked music . " The record player was brought in , along with several of Fausto 's old 78 's . A few more chairs were placed in the room , and the cake was cut . Jess , on his lunchbreak , had just walked in and was handed ten dollars . " Buy something to drink , " Carmela said . He wiped his hands on the grease-stained overalls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " let me buy it . I 'll get double what he gets . " " No , you stay here . " " Trust me . " " Mario , we have enough problems without you bringing the police . " " One time ? I promise nothin 'll happen . " " Okay , give him the money . " After the mariachis started , Jess examined the gray face on the bed , then nudged Carmela with an elbow . " Did he write a will ? " " What for ? " " The house , furniture . . . . " " And the bird . Jess , not now . " " Well , did he ? "  | " He was writing something last night . " " Where is it ? " " Over there , on the dresser . " Jess opened the scroll and read the words with his lips . " What 's it say ? " " I do n't know , it 's got a lot of big words .... " " Spanish ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Forget it , Jess . It does n't really matter . " Mario returned with a fifth of bourbon , a pint of Strawberry Hill and two six-packs of Coors . " Hey , people , here it is ! " Tiburcio and Smaldino went for the beer , Cuca asked for wine , Carmela said she 'd try a little bourbon ? " with rocks " ? Jess said he would wait , and Mario insisted he would share some anis with Fausto . " He ca n't drink , " Carmela said . " Wait 'll you see this , " Mario said , uncapping a small bottle he had hidden in his coat pocket . " He ai n't dead yet . " " Mario , do n't ! " Again , ever so slightly , Fausto wagged his index finger at his niece . Then slowly the tip of his thirsty , quivering tongue appeared between his lips . The song from the stereo had ended , and Carmela stepped across the room to turn the record over . " Wait , " Mario said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That music , hear it ? " " I do n't hear nothing , " Jess said . " Listen . " Cuca bowed her head and tried to listen to every possible sound . Carmela cupped a hand to one ear , and the two beer drinkers said they could n't hear anything . " That 's his friend , " Mario said , " the vato with the flute . " Jess raised the window and searched the scummy haze hanging over the levee and the freightyards . " It 's the trains , " he said , " them squeaking trains . " No one spoke , and after a while the stereo set was closed and put away . " Go answer the door , " Cuca said . " I think someone 's outside . "  | " Come on in ! " Carmela called out the window . " The door 's open . " Tiburcio drained his beer can . " Probably my wife . She said she 'd be over as soon as her hair was dry . " " Have another beer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had enough . " " Carmela , more bourbon ? " " No thanks , I do n't feel too good . " " Senora , more wine . . . ? " Cuca , seated by the bed , was silent . She wiped the dribble from Fausto 's mouth , and for a long time listened to the brittle wheeze coming from his withered throat , stared at the sallow , sagging face , at the thin , crooked fingers , and waited for one more clap .  | THIRTEEN Tere was no funeral , no burial . Instead , Fausto insisted they take him to the beach so he could look at the sea and the women in bikinis for a while . Evangelina , as a last gesture , had promised he could do anything as long as it was n't indecent . When he had filled his mind with enough bodies to last several lifetimes , he left the umbrella and said he wanted to go to a bookstore . " What you wan na do there ? " Mario asked . " Where I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little shop . " Fausto purchased more books than they could carry . Diaries , journals , crates of paperbacks , encyclopedias in five languages , a Nahua grammar , a set of Chinese classics , a few novels by a promising Bulgarian author , a collection of Japanese prints , an illustrated Time-Life series on nature , an early cosmography of the known and unknown worlds , a treatise on the future of civilization in the Sea of Cortez , two coffee-table editions on native American foods , an anthology of uninvented myths and three boxes of unwritten books . " But Tio , look , nothing 's in them . It 's all blank pages . Why do n't you take some books from over there . I saw some real nice ones . " " No , I want these . " " What for ? " " Some people might want to write their own books . If I 'm going to own a store , I want to have everything . " Fausto had toddled up and down the aisles , choosing by color , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the sale table he even wormed his arm down to the bottom of the pile and fished up a  | neglected , indexed history of historiography . Then everything was taken to the front of the store . " Now what ? " Carmela asked him at the cashier 's counter . The automatic doors parted and Mario , followed by Marcelino , pushed in a train of shopping carts they had borrowed from the A &P; down the block . While everyone was stacking books into the carts , Tiburcio and Smaldino strayed over to another counter and slowly flipped their way through an illustrated sex manual . Tiburcio 's wife threw a wine-taster 's guide at the two men . " Come on , you guys , help ! " " Let them look , " Fausto said . " They 're only pictures , que no ? " " It 's pictures like that that give me babies . You know , sometimes I wish he were blind . " " What would that do ? He 's still got pictures in his head . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he does n't have to look . " When the carts were ready , Mario began whispering to the young clerk behind the counter . She was smiling . " What 's he doing ? " Carmela asked her uncle . " Watch . " It was n't long before Mario 's suggestions had transformed the ponytailed brunette into a giant pink chrysanthemum . Her petals unfolded with a slow-motion grace that left everyone with their mouths open . Mrs. Renteria was the first to approach . " I 'd love to pick her , " she said . " I do n't think she 'd like that , " Fausto cautioned . " You see , that 's why she wants to be a flower . If you took her home , you 'd be the only one to see her . " " I 'll take her by the roots and plant her in the front yard . I 'll be careful . " " No , that 's stealing . . . or kidnapping . " " Then let Mario take her out . " Everyone looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tennis shorts and a see-through velveteen shirt . " Not me , " he said , " I 'm a weightlifter . No more stealin ' for me . " He hoisted three boxes of books and trundled another cartload out to the line of parked cars . When he returned , he walked with his legs spread apart , as if he suffered from piles , and his head and rippling , giant 's neck seemed to grow out of a mountainous wall of chest . " Ai n't nobody going to mess  | with me now , " he told Fausto , " not even that vato with the dog . Hey , why do n't we go up to the park and look for him ? " " Later , " Fausto said , " first let 's get all my books . " For a while Mario lumbered around Tiburcio and Smaldino , flexing and lifting tables and bookshelves . Finally he lifted the two men high into the air . They lost their place in the book , but otherwise they hardly seemed to notice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science fiction display . " Do n't worry , " Fausto said , " he wo n't hurt them . Mario ! Finish taking out the books . " Mrs. Renteria stroked the chrysanthemum . " Fausto , are n't you stealing the books ? " " Senora , I 'm not a thief . As soon as I sell them , I 'll give the money to the store . " " Then I 'll buy my flower . Here 's fifty cents . Should I leave it on the counter ? " " You realize you 're taking a person . That flower is a person . Do n't you see how she 's watching us ? She knows . And I think she 'll be very sad if you take her away from her family , her work , maybe even the one she loves . " " Yes , you 're right . I never though about it that way . " Outside on the sidewalk a crowd had gathered around Hercules . He was lifting volunteers over his head . Behind the crowd Cuca and Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Tio , do n't look now , but I think that flower girl 's changing . " " Mario stole her show . . . . Well , we 've got everything . Let 's go . " Fausto and his neighbors hurried into the cars . " Do n't go ! " Tiburcio 's wife shouted . " They 're still in the store . " Fausto rolled down the window of Carmela 's ' 47 Plymouth and called out to Marcelino , who was already comfortably reclined on the roof . " Go get them , and use your flute if you have to . " The shepherd dropped down the sloping trunk and ran into the store . In a moment he returned between the automatic doors . Under each arm he held a large illustrated book . " What do I do with them ? " " Give them to their wives . " The books were given to the women , and Marcelino , gathering his poncho , leaped onto the car again . For the time being Tiburcio lay  | pressed under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , offering himself as a treasure , pleasantly lost himself in his wife 's mind . The procession followed the Santa Monica Freeway as far as Vermont , then wound through downtown Los Angeles , past Bullocks , Clifton 's , the Million Dollar Theater , skirting the old mission , Calle Olvera , and finally along North Broadway , over the river and tracks , crossing Daly and stopping at the Cuatro Milpas take-out and restaurant . Not one car had been lost , they were all together . And hungry . This time Fausto remained in the car , while Carmela and most of the adults left to bring the food . " Tio , what do you want ? " " A number four , with a gordita . And get an empanada for Tico . " " You want milk ? " " Get me a beer . Carta Blanca if they have it . " Fausto teased the parakeet with his finger . Suddenly Tico-Tico raised his furry head from the old man 's shirt pocket and without a word climbed out as a fully grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his chest . " Tico ! Look what you did . My pocket 's ripped . " He ordered cat to sit above the seat , out of the way . " Be good and I 'll give you a gordita . " The food was brought out in paper plates covered with aluminum foil , the drinks in paper bags . Fausto told everyone to follow Carmela 's car to Elysian Park where they could picnic on tables and the children would have someplace to play . " And hurry , or someone might turn into something else . " He glanced at Tiburcio , who apparently had been squeezed of all courage and had returned to being a husband . But Smaldino would n't think of changing . His wife was still excited by the new possibilities for their middle-age love . She held him close to her breasts and every now and then , when her children were n't looking , took a peek at a different page . By the time they arrived at the park Mrs. Noriega had shrunken to a string of beads with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ride the rosary had slipped off the loose foil , settling between the beans and the enchiladas . Except for the cars , the park was deserted . The streets were gone , some trees had shriveled , others had grown . Squirrels poked their heads out of the leaves on the ground , a bank of snow lay gleaming on the ridge below the blue , richly blue sky . A fantailed pidgeon escaped  | the jaws of a snake by swooping up as a hawk , losing itself among the uppermost pines . And there was silence , then the sounds of other birds , of crickets , of frogs by the eddies of a stream . A rabbit moved among the ferns , a twig cracked under the weight of age and a bobcat 's paw . The grasses grew high , and the flowers bent with the breeze , then sprang back and curled their heads to the sun . The scent of pine and sage mingled with the smells of moist earth , tiny onion shoots and the tangled fountains of wild strawberries . Fausto , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground . And as they did so , the cars shook themselves from bumper to bumper and galloped across the stream and into the trees . The old man sat on a broken tree limb and watched them all roll in the grass . Suddenly a green grasshopper latched onto his nose . " Senora , " Fausto softly warned , " be careful of the spiders . " Mrs. Noriega briefly wiggled her abdomen and leaped into the air . In the distance Cuca trotted around like a fox , sniffing , poking , tasting every usable herb and plant , from pole to pole , from arctic ferns and alpine reeds to the mosses of Tierra del Fuego . For a long time Fausto watched the changes of his neighbors , the quirky cartwheels of minds in flight . Now a stork , now a bear , one minute a horse , the next minute the rider , one moment a dog 's howl , the next moment the rustle of wind through the highest trees . It was all a game , free . and forever . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not change . He was too tired . " And you did n't take your pills , " Evangelina said from behind . " But I suppose it 's too late for that now . " Without turning , Fausto patted the space beside him and gestured for her to sit down . Evangelina sat , and the limb broke , dropping them to the ground . " Eva , take it easy . I 'm still alive , remember ? " " Sorry . " He stood and brushed the seat of his pants . " Why did you say it was too late ? " " Your little stones . They fell . " " What happened ? " " The earthquake . " " What earthquake ? I did n't feel anything . " " You were too busy with your books . "  | " Where 's Marcelino , I 'll find Marcelino . " " You ca n't . I said he could go home . " " Why did you do that ? " " He found his alpacas , and he wanted to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened her palm . " Here , he left you this . " " What 's that ? " " An egg . He said it might bring you luck . . . . He also said we could visit him anytime we wanted . " " Sure , I 'll just pretend I have a new pair of lungs . You should see where he lives . You have to be a condor to get there . " " Well , why not ? " " No , I like it here . Have you ever seen such a place ? Now this is paradise . " " Lay down , try to rest . We can play when you get up . " " You remember those mojados I brought over ? " Evangelina placed her fingers over his eyes and massaged his temples . " Yes , I remember . " " They 're probably here too . I told them it was Tamazunchale , but that sounds like Thomas and Charlie . Maybe I should have called it something else . If they ever learn English , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Nothing wrong with that . " " Eva , can you do the back of my neck . I 'm feeling all stiff .. . There , that 's perfect . " " Relax , try to sleep . " " I ca n't . " " Pretend then . Look at the sky and imagine yourself on a cloud , a nice , soft cloud . . . no noise , not even the sound of your heart , nothing to bother you . " " Eva ? " " Yes . " " Do n't go . " " I 'm right here , beside you . " " How long do we have ? " " As long as you want . " " Is everybody gone ? I do n't hear anything . " " No , they 're all here . " " All I can hear is the music . You know , I think Marcelino left his music . Would you like to dance ? "  | " You should be resting . " " Just once .... " The two rose and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carmela waved goodbye , Mario signaled with his thumbs up , and Jess , better late than never , scrambled into the clearing and swore he saw something in the sky . " A frisbee , " Mario said . " No , it looked like somebody was up there . " " A flying saucer ? " Carmela shaded her eyes . " Do n't argue with him , he might change his mind . " " Alright , you saw something . " " Come on , Mario , " Carmela said , " let 's show him what we can do . " " Wait , I think he 's got it . Hey , Jess . . . ? Yeah , see , he turned himself into a television . " " Let 's go in . " " Okay . " Carmela pulled Mario into the set , and the little girl who found the dead man skipped by and tripped on the cord , snapping the plug from the socket . The girl tickled the knobs , but nothing happened , not even the sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become a shadow , Fausto returned and plugged in the cord . " Just so you 'll know I 'm still around , " he said , then disappeared into the cloud to join his wife . His books , cape , staff , cologne and slippers followed him up . Tico-Tico remained on the ground talking to everyone . About the only thing Fausto was to regret was his failure to bring cigarettes . He yawned and glanced down one more time . Of all things to forget . I must be getting old . Que pendejo ! And I had two packs under my mattress . " Fausto ? " " Hmm ? " " Go to sleep . " " It 's not perfect . . . you know that , do n't you ? " " Lie down and stop talking , you 're always talking . And take your slippers off . " Fausto set himself down beside his wife , clapped some life into his cold hands , then crossed them over his chest and went to sleep .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
