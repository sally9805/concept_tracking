French Movie Hero Alain Delon has covered himself with real-life gloire by pulling off a dramatic rescue . What he saved was one of the great historic documents of modern France-the manuscript of Charles de Gaulle 's resounding , rallying cry to Frenchmen during the dark days of June 1940 . " France has lost a battle ! But France has not lost the war ! " De Gaulle wrote from the Free French headquarters that he had established in London . " France . . . will regain her liberty and her grandeur . Such is my goal , my only goal ! " The single sheet on which the 131-word message was written had disappeared . Then , four days after De Gaulle 's death , an unidentified Frenchman offered it to a Paris auction expert named Pierre de St. Cyr for $100,000 , with the stipulation that the sale be secret and that it be made to a foreigner . Shocked at this unpatriotic profiteering , De St. Cyr informed Delon , who sent for a friend from Buenos Aires . Equipped with his foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made the purchase . Delon handed the prize over to the Defense Minister Michel Debr , who presented it to De Gaulle 's Order of the Liberation , founded to honor Resistance heroes . <P> Few of the tourists strolling among the Christmas trees on Washington 's Ellipse near the White House seemed to recognize the elusive Tricia Nixon ( dubbed " the Howard Hughes of the White House " by the mystified press ) and her longtime beau , Edward Finch Cox . At least one who did spy Tricia , though , saw more than blonde hair and dimples : Tricia was wearing a diamond on the ring finger of her left hand . Would she announce her engagement to the son of New York Socialites Mr. and Mrs. Howard E. Cox over the holidays ? Her mother Pat Nixon would only say , " I ca n't keep up with that girl . " <P> <P> Making the social scene in Paris , where she is enjoying all kinds of exotic thrills-such as Rothschilds , raw chestnuts , Vicomtesse Jacqueline de Ribes , and steak tartare-pretty Dewi Sukarno @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indonesia , keeps her rather notable shape with judo . " It 's very funny , " says Dewi . " After each lesson I feel really beaten-up for a couple of days , and then I 'm ready to go again . " One advantage is that it can be practiced at home , unlike another of her favorite sports-horseback riding . But judo is not only for physical fitness , she notes herself . "
