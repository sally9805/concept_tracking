In the land of Lincoln , honoring Abe is not just good politics , it 's good business . Or so thought 22 entrepreneurs in Charleston , Ill. , scene of the fourth Lincoln-Douglas debate . In 1969 the businessmen enthusiastically erected what they claim is the world 's largest statue of Lincoln-62 ft. of fiber glass and steel that cost $40,000-on a site three miles out of town near land they hoped would become a national park . <P> But plans for the park fell through , and Abe was left in the middle of nowhere . On an average day , about 50 tourists would visit the statue and buy souvenir postcards and trinkets . At night , vandals frequently showed up with paint , rifles and shotguns . Soon Abe was ugly and pockmarked . <P> Last week the businessmen sold the statue to Bud Scott , a basketball coach at a local college , who thinks that it will be . just the thing to attract people to his 110-acre campground , recreation area and Christian retreat . None of which would have bothered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the good people , in their wisdom , shall see fit to keep me in the background , I have been too familiar with disappointments to be very much chagrined.
