The scene looks like something out of The Godfather . A bearded Neapolitan and four unsmiling associates alight from a private jet , pile into a black limousine , and head for the office of a prominent editor . They take him for a ride to a local Italian restaurant , where much intense talk and spirited gesticulating ensue . A few hours later , the visitors fly off again in their plane . <P> Variations on that episode have been playing in a number of American cities in recent weeks , but the only real affinity to The Godfather is the fact that the don is played by Francis Ford Coppola , the movie 's director . His traveling companions are new editors of City magazine , a San Francisco weekly that appears next week for the first time in a thoroughly renovated format . Coppola bought a $15,000 piece of the fledgling magazine in 1973 , picked up more last year , and had himself named publisher . " It was my Viet Nam , " he recalls . " Every month I put more into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt I either had to get in or get out . " <P> New Recruits . He stayed in , but grew increasingly dissatisfied with City 's predictable mixture of entertainment listings and windy anti-Establishment articles . He hired a succession of new editors , then grew dissatisfied with them too . Finally last month he suspended publication and fired the entire staff . Since then , he has taken some new recruits-including Editor Michael Parrish , former managing director of the monthly San Francisco , and Consulting Editor Rosalie Muller Wright , former editor of womenSports-across the country to talk publishing with some successful pros . Among them have been New York magazine Editor Clay Felker , New Times Publisher George Hirsch , Ms. Co-Founder Gloria Steinem and Sacramento Bee Managing Editor Frank McCulloch , a former TIME bureau chief who successfully launched the innovative monthly Learning . Coppola did not like what he heard . " Publishing is worse than the movie business-the egos , the feeling that you 've stepped in somebody else 's terrain , " he says . " I sensed a real coldness in Felker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but skeptical , as if he did n't believe it was going to work . " <P> Guest Editors . Small wonder . Starting the kind of polished , expensively produced weekly that Coppola wants would be difficult even in a metropolis like New York or Los Angeles , let alone a second-tier city like San Francisco ( pop . 675,000 ) . In addition , Coppola has drawn up a list of " guest editors " he plans to invite to put out entire issues . Among them : San Francisco Symphony Orchestra Conductor Seiji Ozawa , Rock Singer Sly Stone , Patty Hearst 's ex-fianc Stephen Weed and " an Italian fisherman . " <P> Another Coppola idea is to hold the magazine 's weekly closing in a theater and open the event to the public . Editors would do their work onstage , with galley proofs flashing on a screen behind them , and the audience offering comments , which would be published as a special page of the magazine . Beyond all that , Coppola wants City home-delivered to its projected 100,000 subscribers on Sundays . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have something like the New York Times to settle down with every Sunday morning . "
