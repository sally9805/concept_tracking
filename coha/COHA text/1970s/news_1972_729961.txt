txt The completion of selection of 12 jurors in the trial of the Harrisburg 7 has elicited an unexpected note of optimism from the defense . For the first 11 days of the trial here , the selection process seemed to symbolize the chasm between urban social protest and middle America . The defendants , who include six Roman Catholic clergy and ex-clergy and a Pakistani scholar , insisted they could not find a jury of their peers in the rural , staunchly Republican , heavily Protestant Harrisburg area which ? judging by the testimony of prospective jurors ? had been little moved by the Vietnam war . Yet , when the selection process was finished , the defense admitted it had gotten a much better panel than it had hoped for . " It was basically a good process , " conceded defendant Sr. Elizabeth McAlister , qualifying later , " I am not going to say we are ecstatic . " " It is not the kind of jury we might have gotten in New York or Chicago , " said Sr. Elizabeth . The " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . mentality " of the jury prospects was " quite foreign " to the defendants , she said , The defendants are known to have preferred a location where they might have gotten a greater ethnic and racial mix on the jury . ( The trial could legally have been held in any federal district where an alleged overt act of the conspiracy took place , but the government says Harrisburg was logical because the nearby town of Louisburg was central to several overt acts as well as to the separate count of the exchange of illegal letters between Sister Elizabeth and Fr . Philip Berrigan , while he was in Louisburg prison. ) // *Harrisburg 7 show optimism ' on jury // Despite their objections , however , the defendants privately admit that the jury is more than they hoped for . Though the final panel of 46 prospects , selected from more than ' 300 who were questioned , contained only a handful who had some higher education , six of these wound up on the jury . The jury of nine women and three men also includes three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was mostly middle-aged . Three members have indicated that they oppose the Vietnam war ( the rest were neutral or had no opinion ) , and one black remained after three were struck by challenges in the last two days ( the first by the government , the second two on unknown challenges , since final jury selection was done in secret at the judge 's bench ) . The Judge , R. Dixon Herman , is known to be extremely chary of the effect of extensive pretrial publicity in this case ( he removed more than one-third of the venire-men merely for stating they had prior opinions on the case , according to defense figures ) . Sonic local observers say he hoped by allowing extensive questioning to forestall a later appeal on the basis of pretrial publicity . Nun comments The selection process seems to have been a rude shock to most of the defendants . Sr. Elizabeth said later : " We tend to liv6 in an ivory tower . We can get the impression that other people think and feel the same way . " The defendants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the war issue , at their " blind trust " in authority ( typified by the comment of a Fredericksburg woman storekeeper who said about the war , " You ca n't do nothing about it , you just have to go along with it , " and the lack of women 's liberation . But by the second week , the defense was taking full advantage of the leeway allowed by Judge Herman , probing deep into jury prospects ' opinions on the war , understanding of conspiracy , attitudes toward government authority , and attitudes toward " long hairs " ( Would you give preference to the testimony of a short-haired FBI agent over someone with long hair and an unconventional life-style ? " ) . One defense source noted that if they had asked as tough questions the first week , the whole jury might be different . War views involved During the final selection period , when the defense had 24 peremptory challenges and the government six , the defense criteria , according to defendant Eqbal Ahmad , were as follows : Opposed to those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to those " strongly favoring the war on the - grounds of ' this il -- what the government did , ' " and favoring " intelligence . . . regardless of present political attitude . " However , one man with a master 's degree was eliminated , reportedly because the defense was unsure of his war views and the fact that he had had a top-secret security clearance . The final panel included : A young housewife who reads the papers ; a middle-aged housewife who has been " against the war for the last few years " ; a young stenographer with junior-college training who thinks " we 'll always have war " ; a middle-aged accountant with a master 's degree who reads extensively ; a middle-aged housewife who is a former pharmacist ; a pretty high-school graduate in her 30 's who lived in Thailand for three years with her civilian husband , but is undecided on the war ; a black housewife in her 40 's ; a sixtyish housewife with four sons who were conscientious objectors ; the retired owner of two supermarkets who would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a welfare worker in her early 20 's with three years of college ; a Roman Catholic bookkeeper who thinks the war is " a big waste " ; and a middle-aged teacher of volunteer firemen who is " absolutely convinced the war is a mistake . " While the process of picking six alternates now is going on , the jury has already been sequestered , over the objections of the defense .
