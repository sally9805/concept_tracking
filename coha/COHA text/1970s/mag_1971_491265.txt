The Bombay Burinali Trading Corporation had an elephant camp headquarters at Mansi , on a tributary of the Llyu River , which is a tributary of the Chindwin in western Burma . Mansi was a sleepy jungle town . In my time , it had a small police outpost , a sergeant with five or six men , just to show that the government way off in Rangoon knew there was such a place . Most of the activity in Mansi came from the company . We kept men and animals to gather teak and place the logs in streams to float down to Maingkhaing , where they were collected and formed into rafts . One of my duties was to call at Mode during my swings through the district to see that everything was in order . " Oh , " he replied , " that elephant is minding the baby . He 's pushing a cradle . " I thought the man must he pulling my leg . But he kept a straight face , so 1 went up to the tree for a look . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hanging from a branch , and this gigantic elephant with massive tusks was gently moving the cradle from side to side . He used just enough strength to keep it swaying . He never jarred it . He would take the swing against his head , pull back slightly , and then propel it forward in a smooth motion . The baby in the cradle was sound asleep . The sight astonished me so much that I de ? cided to ask the baby 's mother about it . We found her down at the stream washing clothes . " It is safe to leave your baby in the cradle with that big elephant ? " I asked . " Wo n't he squash it ? " The woman laughed . " Completely safe , " she said . " The elephant loves babies . He 's rockedfeet and weigh in the neighborhood of three tons his short neck does n't permit him to turn his head to the rear , his eyesight is poor , his brain is small in proportion to his body , he needs hundreds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That sounds as if the elephant would be about as useless as the rhino until ? you look at the other side of the coin . The elephant has virtues no rhino ever had . He is friendly toward men , docile , patient , obedient . And intelligent . He learns quickly despite his comparatively small brain . it does n't require a human teacher to train an elephant to be smart . Nature trains him herself . Wild elephants have an amazing sagacity . When I was a game ranger I set out to kill a couple of inveterate raiders , big tuskers that would n't leave the villages alone . But they outmaneuvered me . There was a herd nearby . and the tuskers would move into the middle of a The first time I visited the area I found a small camp of little bashas where the mahouts lived with their families . I walked through with my Burmese assistant . At the last baslia I saw a huge elephant standing under a tall tree . The animal was not moving its feet but moving its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I asked my assistant , a native of Maingkhaing , " Is there something wrong with that elephant ? " almost all of those in the village . He 's been doing it long enough to know how . He once rocked me in my cradle . " This was the most unusual case of a working elephant I ever came across ; but the Burrnans use elephants in many remarkable ways . There is n't a more helpful domestic animal anywhere as far as I know , surprising as it seems . Here you have a great hulking brute ? a large bull may stand tengroup of females as soon as they sensed I was around . They all understood the danger . Probably hunters had killed a few elephants in the herd , and the rest learned what to do when another hunter arrived . I tracked the tuskers for several days without getting a chance to take a shot . They would retreat as soon as they got the scent , and the females would charge forward in my direction , trumpeting angrily . The whole // herd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the two bulls and they knew I would n't shoot any females . The best I could do was keep them all moving away from the cultivated area and back into the jungle . The story does n't end there . Another hunter was scouting this elephant herd . I saw his tracks , the pug marks of a big tiger . He had his eye on a tiny calf that ? judging from the footprints , which were smaller than a saucer ? had been born a week or ten days before . Tigers dote on baby elephant , and this tiger stalked the herd hoping to cut off the youngster and kill it . The mother of the calf understood better than I the danger lurking in the undergrowth . She never let the baby fall behind as the herd moved on but kept the little fellow up ahead of her , slightly to one side , within easy reach of her trunk , taking it slow while the others went on ahead . Once the young one got a little too far away and suddenly gave a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the undergrowth . and loud screaming , and dust flying around . The big elephant came smashing forward at top speed , with trunk up and ears cocked . She jolted to a stop , and a moment later I saw the calf standing between her forelegs as she stared into the jungle . Her behavior could mean only one thing : the tiger was there . I always hated to see a tiger pull down a young elephant . When this mother moved on toward the herd , guarding her calf step by step , I said to my Burmese tracker , " Let 's go to where the herd is grazing right now . This elephant will come along , and the tiger is sure to be right behind her . He wants to make a meal of that baby . I want to get him before he does . " We circled around and climbed a tree over the trail between the herd up ahead and the mother lingering behind . She came along shortly afterward , guarding the calf , stopping every few steps to glare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " Look , " he whispered , " that 's what making her angry ! " He pointed into the undergrowth . The tiger was crouched behind some bushes , staring hungrily at the calf . I reached for my gun , but the elephant moved on at that point , and so did the tiger , disappearing from view , obviously stalking the pair and waiting for the baby to get so far away that he could grab it before the mother came up . This time the pair got into the herd . The baby was safe for the night . The next day the same thing happened . The herd moved to a new area . The mother kept hanging back , measuring her pace to that of her calf as he struggled along . The tiger kept prowling around the calf . My tracker and I kept after the tuskers . We were off to one side in the jungle when the entire herd began to converge , stamping and screaming . There was no mistaking that sound . They were getting the scent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tree so that we could see what was happening in that patch of the jungle . The elephants were facing in one direction . The tiger was slipping through the bushes in an attempt to get downwind from them . His hunting preoccupied him so much that he forgot to watch out for hunters who might be after him . He dodged the wind , but he did n't dodge my bullet . That was one kill I felt happy about , because I love baby elephants . I would like to have patted this one 's mother on the head . Between us , we had saved him from the tiger . A wild elephant knows all kinds of tricks . Going up a steep hill , he will curl his trunk around trees or bushes and lever himself up . Going down , he will stretch his legs out before and behind and slide down on his belly . For all his bulk , he will stand motionless , not even twitching an ear , when he senses danger . Heedless of the noise he makes when out in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grove by night so silently that he will not alert the owner who may he sleeping only a few yards away . This last is one type of elephant that has to be shot . A few elephants can ruin the economy of villagers who have nothing to make a living from except their banana groves , rice paddies , and other crops . It 's terrible for a farmer to come out in the morning and find that a herd has played merry hell with his livelihood . When this happened , or seemed about to happen , we game rangers were called in to shoot enough elephants to give the rest the idea that they would be better off deep in the jungle . For an animal lover like myself , it was gratifying to see how often elephants learned from experience . Realizing after a couple had been shot that the survivors would suffer the same fate if they kept raiding the crops , they 'd quite often move off of their own accord . I came across one astonishing example of elephant sagacity , or instinct or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elephants more or less in a line along a range of hills bordering some rice paddies . The next season the tracks of the herd showed that they had come back to the paddy fields at the same place . When they reached the spot where I had killed the first elephant the year before , they seemed to sense something . They paused , milled around , and then retreated into the jungle . Some time later they returned . Now they reached the spot where I had killed the third or fourth elephant , and again they felt that something was wrong , and again they swung around and retreated . They made a third approach to the same paddy fields , emerging near where I had killed the last elephant . This time they were so disturbed that they not only retreated but abandoned the area . They were n't seen by the villagers for another two years . Of course , there is the elephant who wo n't be frightened off . Typically , this is the rogue , the " man-eating tiger " of the species @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be shot as a danger to life even more than to property . Different causes will make an elephant go mad . An old bull may be driven from a herd by younger rivals . That leaves him in a constant rage , and he will charge at anything in his path , man or beast . A young elephant may attack man because man has attacked him . It 's the same as with the man-eating tiger . Somebody goes out with an inadequate gun , or does n't shoot accurately , and merely wounds the elephant . The beast roars off into the jungle , nursing a wound that refuses to heal . Maybe the bullet has caromed off a tusk into the soft flesh at the base of the trunk where a very sensitive nerve runs up into the head . The elephant suffers from a continual throbbing pain . He remembers that a human being did this to him . He becomes savage , out for revenge . And he 'll charge any man , woman , or child who gets close to him . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock-still in the tall grass , wait for a human to approach , and then light out after him . This is about as terrifying an experience as anyone can ever have . An elephant , traveling at twenty-five miles per hour , is much faster than a man and can easily run him down in an open field . Obstacles mean nothing to an elephant . Where a man has to go around a big thorn bush or a clump of bamboo , the elephant will plow straight through . I 've seen a bamboo clump leveled with the roots torn up , which takes enormous weight and power . A man would n't have been able to push between the trees , but the elephant simply pushed them over because he could n't be bothered going around . Someone with no jungle experience might think he could evade an elephant by letting the animal pound toward him and then jumping to one side . What he fails to grasp is the hugeness of the beast . Even if he escaped the trunk and the tusks and the head , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which widens out on either side . And being grazed is all it takes to smash a man to death . A rogue , being gifted with an elephant 's intelligence , may go on killing people for years before he 's cornered and shot . I went after one in Assam that had killed more than sixty victims : he had been wounded by a hunter . Having learned his lesson about the peril of a man with a rifle , he 'd never come out of the jungle until he had surveyed the landscape , and then he 'd smash up whole villages and terrorize his section of Assam . The huts of India were not built on stilts like Burmese huts but were level with the ground . This rogue would move in from the jungle by night , advance silently to a hut , push in the wall with his head , and trample over everything and everyone inside . In one instance a twelve-year-old boy , sound asleep on his pallet , was crushed to death by the elephant 's foot . Another time a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cried out , but was too frightened to run when she saw the monster shambling toward her hut . All three were crushed to death in the ruins . Other villagers were gored or trampled . Many who got away alive saw their homes devastated . This creature had the biggest footprints I 've ever seen . I 'd spot them here and there , recognizing them every time as he dodged me and kept me guessing where he 'd turn up next ? perhaps he recognized my footprints . It was rather chill . ing to imagine him screened by a clump of bamboo , watching me enter a village , rifle in hand , and then hustling off while I was still inspecting the damage he had done . But that 's the way of the experienced rogue . He fooled me at one place after another . I like to think that I would have caught up with him in time , but in fact he reached the end of his career of crime by accident . He was in part of the jungle where he thought he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for him stumbled on him and brought him down . The first rule in elephant hunting is this : Do n't take the chance of creating a maddened beast that will turn into a rogue . Use a sufficiently heavy gun to kill the animal , and place your shots scientifically from within a range near enough to be effective . You should kill your quarry with one shot if possible . This can be accomplished in live ways , as I frequently explained to the amateurs I took elephant hunting . If you shoot an elephant behind the shoulder toward the chest cavity , you can place your bullet in his heart . If he 's standing still , he 'll drop in his tracks . If he 's running , he 'll fall and careen to a stop . Most opportunities , however , involve hitting an elephant in the head , and here there are four basic shots depending on the angle of approach . Let 's take the most frightening experience ? when the animal spots you and comes charging head on , ears acock , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shake with the force of his attack . What you do is wait until he 's twenty-five yards or so from you ; draw an imaginary line from one eye to the other , bisect the line , and aim two inches above the bisection ; press the trigger . Your bullet will knock him stone dead . When the elephant is n't facing you directly , you have three possibilities . If his head is canted at a three-quarters angle , pick out his eyebrow and plant your bullet just above it . If he 's at right angles to you , choose the ear as your target ? making sure that the other ear is in direct line of fire , because if his head is not straight the bullet may be deflected by the bony obstruction of the ear . Finally , if you are approaching the elephant from the rear , remember that every elephant has a habit of flapping his ears and select a moment when the ear is flapped forward , noting the mastoid behind the ear and firing at the depression over the mastoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : to cause the bullet to penetrate the brain through its center . If your line is off , you may knock the beast down only to see him get up again . With a bullet in the brain , he may be badly wounded but not anywhere near dead . You may be the first to die if he catches up with you . One word of advice . Be sure your nerves are in good shape before you face a charging elephant , or you might get your kill and still come out a nervous wreck . I once hit one with a perfect frontal head shot . He went down , but his momentum sent him careening toward me . When he stopped , the tip of his trunk was only about ten feet from me . He was too close for me to run or fire again . Dead or alive , had he reached me , I would have ended up under a few tons of elephant . My knees were shaking as he drove into the dirt . Sweat poured down my back . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've known men who had similar experiences and never did recover , never went out loaded for elephant again . In shooting elephants , the impact of the bullet counts more than the velocity . The same applies to tiger shooting . A tiger has been known to cover a hundred yards after being shot through the heart . With his speed and weight , he 'll bowl a man over and maul him even when mortally wounded . Both tiger and elephant hunters should carry rifles with sufficient striking power to knock the animal down . The biggest caliber I ever used was the .600 , with a bullet as thick as a man 's thumb . The smaller dimensions were effective too ? the : 500 , for instance , and the .425 . Any of these will give an elephant a shock that will jar him to one side or send him crashing to earth , and even if he staggers to his feet , he 'll be too stunned to go right after you . However , I 'm not advocating simple adoption of the biggest gun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discard the bigger bores because the recoil was so powerful that they 'd virtually knock me down while they were knocking an elephant down . For example , the .600 , a small cannon that shoots a flash of yellow flame along with the bullet , gave me a shoulder so bruised and swollen I could hardly raise my arm . After a little experimenting , I went to the calibers that took care of big game without taking care of me at the same time . With a .425 could be sure of firing as many shots as necessary without being laid up for repairs each time . I 've been talking about wild elephants and how intelligent they are . As for tame elephants , what man has done is to teach them a new vocabulary . In the jungle they speak in natural sounds ? cries of alarm , screams of rage . and the low grunting noise that indicates pleasure . The tame elephant picks up a human vocabulary of twenty-five or thirty words which he understands perfectly . I do n't know how many he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and memory . The Burmese stopped the lessons when the pupil had mastered a limited set of useful terms . Such as : Yoo ! ( Pull ! ) Oung ! ( Push ! ) Met ! ( Kneel ! ) Tah ! ( Stand ! ) This type of vocabulary was fundamental in the timber business . It enabled the mahout to tell his animal what to do and when to do it . Most of our mahouts came from jungle villages . They were uneducated men who were n't interested in any other sort of job , rough-and-tumble characters who liked rugged outdoor work , especially when it concerned elephants , which they knew a good deal about since they had lived in elephant territory since they were children . The city people of Burma did not consider the job of the mahout a romantic one . They thought only loo mike , a man of bad character , went into this kind of work , that he was n't fit for anything better , and that any villager of sense and ambition would necessarily choose a better way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . I handled mahouts for several years and found them very friendly fellows , not the kind you 'd have trouble with , except on rare occasions . They were good , reliable workers and took pride in themselves and their elephants . The company hardly ever had to fire a mahout for laziness , incompetence , or insubordination . These men liked what they were doing and were paid well . They had no reason to be troublemakers . It 's a beautiful thing to see a mahout working with his elephant . They become good friends , often friends for life if the mahout gets the elephant when they are both young . You may find a man of forty and an animal of forty who have been together for thirty years . But it does n't take that long to form a team . A few months of close association are usually enough to convince both that the elephant will instantly obey the mahout 's commands , and that the mahout will see to all the elephant 's needs . Their comradeship reveals itself in many ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lying on his side in a stream while his mahout clambers over his huge flanks , giving him a good scrubbing with a kind of foamy soap made from a special Burmese root . When the scrubbing is finished , the mahout will polish the elephant 's tusks until they gleam in the sunlight . All the while , the gigantic beast will have a pleased look on his face , like a cat having its ears scratched . We had elephants of all ages , from newborn calves to fifty-year-old tuskers . The half-grown animals were put to work as pack animals , carrying us and equipment from place to place . The older ones did the heavy work of moving the teak . They 'd be on the job for nine months of the year , resting from April to June , the hot , dry season in Burma . It 's dangerous to work them in the heat because they have difficulty breathing and do n't perspire freely enough to maintain body temperature at the right level ? we 'd have had Rangoon in a dither about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we kept the elephants on the job four days a week and gave them the other three off . They were turned loose each night , forefeet fettered so they could only shuffle along , and allowed to forage for themselves in the jungle , thus permitting them some freedom to roam and cutting down our food bill . Each morning each mahout would go looking for his charge , who , in addition to being Continued on page 127 hobbled , so he could n't wander too far , wore a bell made of wooden clappers to make finding him easy . A mahout could unerringly pinpoint his own elephant from the sound of clappers , no matter how many others might be in the same part of the woods at the same time . If all was quiet , the mahout would look for footprints , which were a certain method of identification to him . He might find that the quiet was deliberate . Elephantine intelligence includes a skill in rendering clappers virtually noiseless by filling in the hollow parts with mud . The morning routine was for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him , take hold of one of its ears , order it to " lift , " step onto the curved trunk , and " ride " up to his seat on its neck . The pair would then travel together back to camp , where the mahout would saddle his mount , and attach a harness with heavy chains extending backward on each side . At the site of the teak felling , the chains would be fastened to a log weighing perhaps a couple of tons . The elephant would lean into his harness , taking the force of the load against his chest . After a moment of straining , the Iog would begin to move . On level terrain , the problem would be simply to keep it moving to the pile . On rough terrain , the elephant might have to maneuver the log over rocks with his feet and tusks , or send it bouncing down a cliff by butting it over the edge . At the pile , he would boost his contribution into place , sometimes rising on his hind legs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piles ? in shallow streams , or on mud flats , or along banks where high water could reach them that rose with the rain and gave off the telltale booming sounds , providing the elephant corps with the additional task of going into the water to break up the log jams that might be forming . At the same time , the rafts had to be constructed . And this is where the intelligence of the elephant really seems fantastic , far beyond that of a cat or a dog or a horse . A mahout will keep up a constant chatter directed at his companion on the job , and the creature will somehow pick out the right commands to obey . I once watched a mahout on the bank giving instructions to his elephant in the water with a string of oaths and other compliments so complex that had trouble following them myself . " Not that log , " the mahout called out , " the one on the other side ! I told you quite plainly to go over to the east , not the west @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Have n't you got any sense ? Do I have to go in the water and show you how to move logs ? So , you got that one into place , didyou ? All right , now go over to the side upstream ! Upstream , you numbskull ! Ca n't you get it right the first time ? You 'd better get this raft together or you 'll catch it ! I 'm not going to wait all day ! Speed it up ! " The mahout kept firing this kind of talk at the elephant , who understood what the mahout was shouting about by the tone of his voice . Patiently he pushed one log into place and then another , moving around in the water from point to point , assembling them in the necessary pattern for the trip downstream . This went on all afternoon , with the elephant changing direction to handle different logs as the order came from the bank . The final command was to wade ashore : " Come on ! You can stop working for now ! After all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the raft together ! " The elephant came up onto the bank , lifted the mahout onto his neck , and lumbered off toward the camp . The understanding between them was marvelous . Off duty , a mahout will play with his elephant . He 'll proudly show the tricks the animal can do . " Let 's go ! " the mahout will say . " Let 's see how you can hop on one leg . Right leg first . That 's good . The people are impressed with you . Now show them something else . How about a handstand ? " The elephant obeys , raising his huge bulk up onto one hind leg , then onto the other , then going up on his front legs for a real balancing act . Of course , commands to sit , lie down , and roll over are simple for him to understand and obey . They 're very gentle , these biggest of land animals . The dangerous elephant is the exception . Naturally , accidents do happen , and once in a while a mahout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to play with her calf with as little concern as a cat with kittens . Just do n't frighten the youngster , because if he raises a cry of fright , his mother may go for you so it pays to keep a safe distance from her . Even then , however , the incident passes quickly , the mother quieting down as soon as the baby does . The one tame elephant that often becomes savagely violent is the male afflicted with musth , which is usually connected with a state of sexual excitement . The beast may be already turning savage when glands near the eyes secrete a fluid that drips down on either side of the face and especially when it gets into the mouth , which sends him into a paroxysm of madness . That 's when he may gore other ele-phants , and turn on his mahout . Many mahouts have been killed by Continued on page 128 continued from page 127 musth elephants . Logging camps have been thrown into a turmoil . Yet , there is usually no need to kill the villain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and regain his former composure . A week after killing his old master , he may be back at work under a new mahout . Sick elephants also required special handling in our logging camps . An elephantine bellyache had to be treated with medicine on the same scale , and the Burmans , with their timeless comprehension of the beast , would concoct brews strong enough to kill a man . They 'd boil vines , leaves , and other ingredients , fill a tub , and pour gallon upon gallon of the stuff down the throat of the patient . Nine times out of ten , the cure worked . Folk wisdom came to my aid one time when I saw an elephant with a badly swollen hind leg . " Cobra bite , " his mahout informed me . " Are you positive ? " I asked doubtfully . " Here , I 'll prove it , " he said , and , whipping out his knife , he deftly lanced the swelling with a twist of his wrist , plunged his hand into the opening , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poisonous-looking matter . " Only a cobra can do that to an elephant , " he observed . All the mahouts looking on nodded their agreement . never questioned from then on that cobras do bite elephants . A full-grown elephant wo n't die , but he 'll suffer from a bad limp and fever until the venom works itself out of his system . Lancing is rarely as simple as in the above case . If the elephant sees the knife , he will usually shy away from it , backing up or turning in a circle to face you , because he knows the instrument you 're holding is going to hurt him . We had an elephant in one camp with a monumental eruption along the shoulder that pained him so badly he could scarcely stand it . Yet he refused to let anyone approach that shoulder . After some fruitless maneuvering , a plan occurred to me . " Give me the knife , " I said to the mahout . " You keep him occupied in the front while I slip around the rear . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then you pull his ears forward and hold them . That way he wo n't see me with the knife . " It worked . The ears acted like blinkers on a horse . He never noticed me advancing along his flank . I reached the sore shoulder , plunged the knife into the swelling , and gave a rip . The elephant winced and then halted . A moment later he began to " purr " as the infected matter poured out of the broken skin , relieving the soreness . If you 've ever had a boil lanced , you know how he felt . Minor cuts , bruises , and sprains we pretty much left to the elephants themselves . If working might aggravate the condition , we 'd take the invalid off duty until nature brought him back to health . With pregnant elephants we also let nature take its course , and , after the event , we might present the lady with an extra bunch of bananas as a reward for presenting us with a baby to add to our herd . Incidentally , whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good test of a jungle man . If he knows it 's eighteen months for a female calf , and twenty-two for a male , he 's a pro . When you talk to a Westerner about elephants in Burma , the first thing he thinks of is a man in a swaying howdah holding a rifle at the ready while beaters comb the forest for big game to drive into his path . That was n't the kind of hunting I did , although I rode an elephant on some occasions . It 's safest to be on one whatever the circumstances . Elephants are usually not afraid even of tigers ; on the contrary , tigers are afraid of them . Occasionally a tiger will attack , gashing an elephant with his fangs and claws , perhaps pulling the rider off into the undergrowth . But that 's exceptional . As a rule , you 're safe as long as you 're on an elephant . Once in a while I 'd take a company elephant for a hunt , although not for tiger . I learned how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ride . I 'd say to a friend , " Hey , get off for a spell and let me have a go . " I mastered the art of sitting on an elephant 's neck with my feet pushed up behind his ears , and guiding him to the left or right , making him turn around or stand still by movements of my feet and body . When I went hunting , I 'd find a fettered off-duty elephant , take his fetters off , and say , " Met ! Met ! " As soon as he obeyed by kneeling down , I 'd sling the fetters across the back of his neck , climb up , give him the command to rise , and drive him into the jungle . It was great fun to push fearlessly into the elephant grass ? twelve feet high , almost level with my eyes which a man on foot has to avoid for fear of encountering a big cat or a short-tempered buffalo hiding there . Stalking lesser game in an open field , I could get close to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elephant ? while I was too high for them to catch the human scent . Shooting them was like shooting sitting ducks . I returned to camp with many a stag , boar , and game bird for the pot . I hunted and worked with mature elephants and made pets of theyoung ones . Baby elephants are wonderful creatures playful , inquisitive , and trusting with human beings . Soon after birth , they develop immense strength , and by six months an elephant can hold you on his head without dipping his neck in the slightest . If you try pulling his trunk , he 'll give an affectionate jerk and send you tumbling head over heels . I knew a young elephant who enjoyed having me swing between his tusks ; he could flip me up in the air with a mere toss of his head . During my early period with the Bombay Burmah Trading Corporation , I had a five-year-old female calf who became as fond of me as I was of her . I used to put a basket on her saddle with a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind the big elephants feeling quite satisfied that she was doing her share of the work . We called her Ma Pu , which means " Miss Short , " because she had a stumpy figure lower to the ground than most . Ma Pu liked me so much she 'd force her attentions on me at the most awkward times . Once when I was working on my report about what I 'd found on an inspection tour , Miss Short came up to the table and began to push her head against it . " Take her away ! " I called out . " Take her away ! " Someone drove her off with a cane , the young lady screaming and trumpeting in protest . She circled around , came up to me from the opposite direction , picked up a glass with her trunk , and dashed it to the floor , smashing it to pieces . I had to order a mahout to chain her to a tree ? where she could make all the noise she wanted without preventing me from getting on with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another district , and did n't see Ma Pu for two years . When I returned I saw her mother , and I knew a seven-year-old calf is not separated from the mother . I walked out toward the elephant herd , calling , " Ma Pu , la , la , la " ? which means , " Ma Pu , come , come , come . " The response was the clank-clank of the clappers of an elephant bell and a shuffling sound coming toward me . Here was the young elephant I had known , now wearing a bell , fettered like an adult to prevent her from straying . Recognizing me , she started exploring my pockets with the tip of her trunk . She remembered that I used to carry a delicacy she loved ? tamarind , a kind of bean rolled up into a ball with a little salt , which functions as a mild sort of laxative or tonic . In the old days she knew she could count on me to produce a ball of tamarind from my pocket and this time she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for herself . I do n't know whether it 's true that an elephant never forgets . I do know that one baby elephant remembered her favorite sweet for two years . zr
