IN THE EVENT of imminent nuclear war , the Plattsburgh , New York , police department will assign two patrolmen to direct traffic at the corner of Broad and Cornelia . That was one of the decisions made at a recent meeting in the combination basement and fallout shelter of the Plattsburgh police headquarters , one of several meetings convened to discuss the plan for evacuating Plattsburgh , site of a major Air Force base , during a nuclear crisis . Such an evacuation is expected to cause traffic problems . so two hours one morning were set aside to consider them . It was Plattsburgh police Sgt. George Rabideau who said . " You 'll need at least two men there , " when the intersection of Broad and Cornelia was pointed out on a map . Rabideau was sitting across from a captain representing Plattsburgh Air Force Base and next to a very bored-looking young man from the Clinton County Highway Department . State civil defense planner Joseph Hein , at the head of the table , pointed out a number of other intersections likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Could n't we use school captain asked .

That will leave us free to cover car accidents , " he said , " or fires , or fights between individuals . People will be emotional ? ' Indeed they will . The Plattsburgh evacuation plan , part of the new national civil-defense program called Crisis Relocation Planning ( CRP ) , is designed to be invoked by the President in a period of extreme tension with the Soviet Union . such as that which might accompany conventional warfare between NATO and Warsaw Pact forces in Europe . To prepare for that moment , the Defense Civil Preparedness Agency ( DCPA ? the national civil-defense organization now being merged into the new Federal Emergency Management Agency ) has lieun funding the preparation of detailed evacuation plans for every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theory put forward in a DCPA publication that " there is nothing quite so helpful as being , say , ten miles or more away from a nuclear weapon when it goes off . " There is a substantial debate as to whether this theory makes any sense . but federally funded planners are already at work in every state . The Plattsburgh plan , the most advanced in New York , offers a glimpse of what they are producing . I F YOU HAPPEN it ) LIVE in north Plattsburgh. and American and Russian armies are engaged in battle on the plains of Germany , you will receive on your doorstep one day . perhaps as part of your newspaper . a large pamphlet entitled " Evacuation Instructions . " A prototype has already been prepared . It reads , " If a nuclear attack occurs , the area shown above would be subject to the greatest danger . " By consulting a map above those words . you would see that the danger area includes the city and town of Plattsburgh , as well as the neighboring towns of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living in this risk area must evacuate. when ordered , " the pamphlet says .

The printed instructions would tell you to cut out the large G printed on the back page of the pamphlet I along with the letters of the other routes ) , place it in " the lower left-hand ( Driver 's Side ) corner of your car windshield. " and drive north on either Margaret Street or Route 87 to the Northeastern Clinton Central High School in the town of Champlain. where you would be directed to your host-area lodgings . ( If you had a vacation cabin . relatives , or friends outside Plattsburgh , you would be advised to go there instead . ) The prototype instructions include a list of things to take with you , among them sleeping bags , canned food . radios . shovels , credit cards . and your will . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuclear explosions and three pages of instructions for the building of several types of fallout shelters , ranging from a relatively comfortable basement shelter to one built by digging a ditch under your car and then loading the car with dirt . You sit in the ditch . The full-scale Plattsburgh plan , which is not vet complete . will include lodgirg assignments for evacuees in public and commercial buildings ( host-area homeowners will be asked to volunteer to receive guests ) . special arrangements for key workers who will commute back to their jobs in Plattsburgh. and arrangements for the delivery of food and other supplies to the host areas . Plans will also he made for " derelocation. - in the event the crisis passes . No plans will he made . however . to force anyone to evacuate against his will . " If they do n't want to evacuate , that 's fine . " said Richard Herskowitz. the chief CRP planner in New York State . " We figure 10 to 20 percent will refuse . That will make it easier for everybody else in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civil-defense publication speculates. will include heroin addict . old people . " antiwar idealists " ( " To them , an evacuation should be protesiedl " ) . and pet lovers . " We hate had a lot of concern about pets at our seminars , " Herskowitz said . " We advise people to leave their pets in the basement with a couple . of weeks ' worth of food . if you come back , your pet is still there . If the area 's blasted. he had an easy death . " Herskowitz spoke as he drove south from Plattsburgh to Albany . The meeting had ended and he was headed back to his office . " It 's the best office I ever had . " he said . " The other state offices where I 've worked were all overheated or overcrowded . In the bunker . the air is fresh and clean . " " The bunker " is where he works , headquarters of the Office of Disaster Preparedness of the New York State Division of Military and Naval Affairs . and a relic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called the Emergency Operating Center and Alternate Seat of Government . it is a two-story building constructed completely underground beneath Albany 's state office campus . Equipped with dormitories , food rations . independent power and water systems , radio communications equipment , and toilets with blast-proof flexible pipes . it is designed to house 700 state officials in the event of a nuclear attack . Meanwhile . it is used as a command post during more mundane emergencies and as office space . Herskowitz 's staff of three planners works in a large room with a simulated " Nudet Nuclear Detonation I Report Log " along one wall . A two-megaton bomb , it reports , has fallen on the Westchester Airport : 120.354 people were killed . The 83.5-million bunker was constructed in the early 1960s under the direction of then-Governor Nelson Rockefeller . a vigorous and early champion of civil-defense preparations . ( Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru once emerged from a meeting with the governor and told reporters . " Governor Rockefeller is a very strange man . All he wants to talk about is bomb shelters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have required every New York homeowner to build a fallout shelter . To promote the scheme , Rockefeller sat in a mock shelter in the window of a Manhattan bank . The idea was rejected nonetheless . Two years later . President Kennedy sparked a nationwide shelter boom when he asked Congress for money for an ambitious shelter program and said . " Every American citizen and his community must decide for themselves whether this form of survival insurance justifies the expenditure of effort . time . his civilization ? would survive a major nuclear exchange . " Nuclear war . the report said , would bring about a major depletion of the global ozone layer . with the result that skin cancer would increase significantly and severe sunburn could occur in as little as ten minutes . But the ozone would return to normal in a " decade or two . " Countries not involved in the war would also have to do without food exports from North America . and the NAS could not rule out the possibility of dramatic worldwide climatic changes . But it concluded that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Southern Hemisphere I if the bombs were confined to Russia and America ) . " a decade or so after the event ... surviving humans and ecosystems would be subject to relatively minimal stress attributable to the exchange . " As for that deadly fallout pictured in On the Beach , it would he " short-lived . " So Australia would live on . But what about those of us in the war zone ? Millions of people in the vicinity of nuclear blasts would be instantly vaporized. and millions more would horn to death or die within days from radiation poisoning . But , federal civil-defense planners assert . 80 million or more Americans would survive the short ? term effects of a massive Soviet nuclear attack tomorrow ( although 30 million or so would be injured or sick ( . and . with the implementation of CRP. as many as 150 million could survive . Critics of civil defense do not argue with those numbers , but they echo the statement made by . of all people . Nikita Khrushchev : " The survivors would envy the dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Life as we know it would come to an end . We 'd he holed up in cellars with machine guns trying to protect five cans of tuna fish . " A catalogue of the survivors ' problems was recently rehearsed by MIT physics professor Henry Kendall in testimony prepared for a Congressiona committee . They will face , he said . " essentially complete destruction " of the nation 's economy and a " devastated environment " with " significant ecological imbalances : ' They would therefore be prone to " deep psychic trauma ... leading to a marked incapacity to initiate and implement recovery activities . " The telling argument against civil defense , he concluded , is that any extra survivors it created would " grossly overburden " the nation 's depleted agriculture and industry . " Thus , the consequence of having a large civil-defense program that provided effective urban evacuation and thus was a short-term success would be to enhance the subsequent level of death and injury , and make even a vestigial recovery of an industrial nation a more remote possihihtv . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by civil-defense planners , whose studies present a far more optimistic picture of America after a nuclear war . One DCPA staff member . citing " some $17 million " worth of studies conducted by the DCPA alone between 1963 and 1973 , has concluded that " no insuperable barrier to recovery has been found . " A Post-Nuclear Attack Study ( PONAST ll ) , undertaken in 1972 by the Department of Defense with other government agencies , is cheerier still . Based on a " computer-processed simulation " of a 1971 nuclear war . PONAST reports that 109 million Americans would survive the attack and that six years after the war the economy would have recovered to such an extent that the survivors would have approximated a 1%5 per capita standard of living , except for automobile production . " By the seventh year . the study says , a 1970 standard of living would have been achieved . It does not say whether new Chevies would be available by then . Of course , PONAST acknowledges that post-war America would face problems . Thirty-five million of the 109 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a severe shortage of doctors . But " this situation would gradually improve as injured physicians became able to care for casualties and as casualties got well , or died . " ( A more practical . if less optimistic . approach to this problem was taken by government planners in the 1950s who began stockpiling large quantities of opium for use after a nuclear war . ) The long-term effects of radiation , according to PONAST , would double the survivors ' cancer rate and more than triple the number of birth defects , and the average life-span of the survivors would be shortened by four and a half years . ( Another recent government report asserts . however , that the risk of a survivor 's dying from nuclear war-related cancer in any given year is equivalent to the risk from smoking 300 cigarettes or spending ten hours rock-climbing . ) More food would survive than people to eat it . PONAST reports . Only 44 percent of the U.S. labor force would still be alive , but that would exceed the percentage of surviving industrial facilities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as for the debilitating " psychic trauma " cited by Kendall , PONAST says that " there would not be a collapse of our society . " Instead . " the initial loss of confidence in government could he overcome by the prevalence of positive , adaptive behavior .... " In conclusion , the PONAST analysis asserts that both the United States and the Soviet Union could survive . recover , and even " continue the conflict . " T HE CHANCE OF such happy results would he enhanced . of course . by careful pre-war planning . and in this country that planning has been going on for well over a decade . The National Plan for Emergency Preparedness. first published in 1964 and now being revised , is an unclassified compendium of post-attack activities dedicated to the goals of bringing the war " to a favorable conclusion , " saving life and property , and recovering as a nation while preserving , as far as possible , individual rights . representative government , and the free-enterprise system . Among the hundreds of steps enumerated in the National Plan are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President ( circling overhead in his command plane ) would issue an order freezing all prices , wages . and rents . ? The Post Office would distribute Emergency Change of Address cards . ? Food rationing would be imposed . limiting each survivor to a weekly allotment of three pounds of meat . six eggs . seven pints of milk . four pounds of fruits and vegetables , a half-pound of fats and oils , two pounds of potatoes . and a half-pound of sweets . For purposes of substitution , one pound of meat would be considered equal to two and three-quarters pounds of potatoes . two and a half pints of milk . a half-pound of cereal . or twelve eggs . ? Efforts would be made to ensure the clearance of checks . including those drawn on destroyed banks . ? Plans would be made for the equitable sharing of war losses . ? The Securities and Exchange Commission would attempt to reestablish the stock market . A number of even more practical aspects of postwar life were delved into at a government-sponsored symposium on " Postattack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Public Health Service there pointed out one positive result of nuclear holocaust : it would eliminate tuberculosis . " We are gradually cutting it out by chemotherapy now , " he said . " We are cutting it out by improved standards of living , but the city is where the infections now survive and it is what would be destroyed by the attack .... " Also at the symposium . a representative of the Office of Emergency Planning discussed a situation that might be faced by tax assessors after World War Ill : " Consider a firm whose principal assets consist of a professional football team valued . preattack , at about $15 million . Suppose that the players survived the attack and that all debts of the team were fully paid up . Any plan to levy . for example . a net-worth tax postattack must face up to the fact that this team 's relative net worth in real terms is certainly not going to be the same as preattack . " Of course , civil-defense planners do realize that most people will have greater worries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teams . A manual prepared in 1973 by the DCPA for local civil-defense planners includes , along with the advice that mosquito control efforts should begin two to four weeks after a nuclear attack , a section on " motivating the survivors . " Most survivors , it says , would " focus on the problem of supplying the basic needs for food , water , and shelter for the family . " However , it points out , " Individual and small-group foraging and hoarding of found supplies consume available resources and do nothing to bring about future resupply . " Therefore . " local authorities should take charge of critical supplies " to distribute them fairly for survival and " to provide meaningful rewards for productive work . " The survivors . it says , " are apt to welcome positive action of this kind and are likely to place a high social value on opportunities to participate in activities clearly associated with improving personal and national well-being . " Well , perhaps . Nobody really knows what a nuclear war would be like because we 've never had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . acknowledge that many Americans would survive , at least for a while . Whether they would survive to duel over cans of tuna fish or to work in the postwar stock exchange is a matter of debate . but survival comes first . And there , one might reasonably suppose . lies the justification for Crisis Relocation Planning ? that survival is possible . and that . with CRP. more survival is possible . But one would be wrong . CRP is only secondarily about survival . Here is the view of DCPk chief Bardyl Tirana . overseer and proponent of CRP : " I do not think CRP is. in its first instance . done to save lives once a war breaks out . It is done to help prevent a war from breaking out in the first place . " Thus , civil defense is not seen as an emergency lifesaver . It is seen as part of America 's strategic deterrent . It is seen , ironically , almost as a weapon . The shelter gap U NM . THIS DECADE the role of civil defense as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy makers . " We will deter an enemy from making a nuclear attack only if our retaliatory power is so strong and so invulnerable that he knows he would be destroyed by our response . " said President Kennedy in his May , 1%1. address . " If we have that strength . civil defense is not needed to deter an attack . If we should ever lack it . civil defense ? snuld not be art adequate substitute . " The emphasis on retaliatory strength evolved during the 1960s into the policy known as " Mutual Assured Destruction : . or MAD . On one hand , the MAD doctrine holds that if our weapons can inflict " unacceptable damage " on the Soviet Union in response to any Soviet attack . they never would dare to attack . ( Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara. in characteristic fashion , attempted a quantitative definition of " unacceptable damage . " It would consist , he said in 1965 , of one-quarter to one-half the Russian population killed and two-thirds of Russian industrial capacity destroyed . ) The other side ofMAD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroy us . If the Soviets ever felt they were about to lose that capability ( say . because America developed first-strike weapons that could destroy their retaliatory forces ) . it is argued that they might feel compelled to launch a preemptive strike . ( Another consequence of their inability to destroy us. of course . is that at ' might be encouraged to start a war . ) " In the interest of stability . " Defense Secretary Harold Brown wrote in his annual report to Congress just this January . " we avoid the capability of eliminating the other side 's deterrent . insofar as we might be able to do so . " A logical extension of the MAD doctrine has meanwhile provided an argument against civil defense . because civil defense may limit an enemy 's ability to destroy vou . That reasoning was in fact applied to the 1972 treaty limiting the deployment of antiballistic missiles ; the treaty , according to a memo from the Joint Chiefs of Staff . was " based primarily on a philosophy of mutual vulnerability to retaliatory attack . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . has presented little barrier to assured destruction . but Soviet civil-defense activities have apparently proceeded from a different perspective . The Russians have , and have had for years , an ambitious civil-defense program based on public education . factory drills , blast and f'allotit shelter construction , encouragement of industrial dispersal and " hardening , " and plans for massive urban evacuations . The Joint Congressional Committee on Defense Production concluded in 1977. after studying the Russians ' civil-defense program , that all their efforts could not prevent American forces from achieving assured destruction in a war . Hawkish defense analysts and lobbyists , however . have seen cause for alarm . The Coalition for Peace Through Strength . in a position paper attacking the SALT II treaty as an " act of phased surrender . " claimed that Soviet civil defenses under mine the credibility of American deterrence . Russia could go so far as to launch a nuclear attack against our missile bases . the paper said , while retaining enough weapons " to destroy 60 percent of all Americans if the United States were to re-whale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more than 4 percent of their population because of their active civil defense . It is most unlikely that any U.S. President would retaliate after a Soviet first strike if the Soviet response would kill 100 million to 150 million Americans . " Short of a nuclear attack . some of the coalition 's members argue . the Soviet Union could blockade our oil supplies or invade V ? itstern Europe , secure in the knowledge that the United States could not aflOrd to start a nuclear war in which we would lose many more lives than they would . " They 'd lose lit million Soviet eitizensT Representative Mitchell says . " They lost far more than that in World War 11 . They might be willing to take that risk. - MS ALARMIST argument has not gone unchallenged . " We have more than 9.000 individual nuclear warheads , and the number is increasing every day . " Paul Warnke. limner head of the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency . recently told a Congressional committee . " Against these inescapable facts , it is . I submit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fatalities . No rational leadership could subject its country to the unexampled devastation that would he punishment for the monstrous crime of initiating a strategic nuclear war . " Moreover , it is argued that those who find Soviet civil defense so impressive have spent too much time reading Soviet civil-defense manuals I which are excellent I and too little time considering how that theory would translate , or fail to translate . into practice . A lengthy analysis released early this year by Rep. Les Aspin ( D.-Wisc . I asserted that the Soviet civil-defense program is hampered by widespread apathy and bureaucratic incompetence , and is. within Russia . " the topic of numerous jokes . " In addition . it said , Soviet shelters are inadequately stocked . Soviet evacuation plans rely to an impractical extent on millions of people walking long distances in any kind of weather , and that an American retaliatory attack , even on a dispersed Soviet population . would cripple the Soviet economy . producing widespread hunger . disease . and even revolt . Critics of the new civil-defense boosters finally point to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as justification for theirs . " American shelter construction rates have been increasing . " Soviet civil-defense chief Gen. Alexander Altunin recently wrote . " Measures to enhance the stability of operation of industry and other sectors of the economy under wartime conditions are being persistently implemented . Civil defense is receiving more and more effective assistance from the U.S. Armed Forces ... and the entire population is being trained in civil defense . What can be said in regard to this ? The imperialists will be waiting in vain for us to sit idle in the face of such facts . " Our view of Soviet programs . critics argue . is likely to be as distorted as their view of ours . The most telling response of the civil-defense boosters to all of this is that it does n't matter if the Soviet civil-defense system really would work : all that matters is if the Soviet leaders think it would . since they could be as easily led into reckless behavior by a false assumption as by a true one . This was one of the issues considered last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense that produced a report released by the director of the CIA . The Soviet Union , the report said , has done far more than we have in constructing blast shelters for government leaders and key workers , and it does have plans for urban evacuations that could significantly reduce casualty figures . The goals of the civil-defense program are to limit war losses , help win the war , and then recover . And , the report says , " The Soviets almost certainly believe their present civil defenses will improve their ability to conduct military operations and will enhance the U.S.S.R. 's chances for survival following a nuclear exchange . " Nevertheless . the report concluded , none of their civil-defense measures could " prevent massive damage " from a U.S. attack , and Soviet leaders " can not have confidence ... in the degree of protection their civil defense would afford them , given the many uncertainties attendant to a nuclear exchange . " In sum , it concluded , " We do not believe that the Soviets ' present civil defenses would embolden them deliberately to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Since all the arguments for increased American civil defense as a response to Soviet civil defense carry the startling implication that otherwise the Soviets might not be unwilling . in some circumstances , to risk being attacked by the entire American nuclear arsenal . that conclusion might have settled the issue . But it did n't . Defense Secretary Harold Brown , in his report to Congress in January . wrote , " If our limited , second-strike response options are to be fully credible , our friends as well as our opponents must understand not only that we can use our strategic forces in a deliberate and controlled way against meaningful targets . but also that people at risk in potential target areas in the United States can be evacuated and protected . at a minimum , from the short-term effects of nuclear weapons . " Thus ? in Pentagonese ? does Brown invoke the hawks ' scenario of a Soviet first strike against our missile silos . To prevent such an attack i.e .. ( if our deterrent is to be " credible " ) . Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ response options " ( not necessarily " assured destruction " ) and that we have the ability to evacuate our cities to protect our citizens from a Soviet third strike . Thus is begat Crisis Relocation Planning . c BP SAS . IN FACT . first funded at a low level by the Defense Department in 1975 , after ii considered and rejected other civil-defense options ranging from doing nothing to building SW billion worth of blast shelters . One argument for CRP. of course , was that it would save lives in a war ( provided we had several days ' advance warning of an attack ) , but its strategic value has also been stressed from the beginning . " I would never contemplate our evacuation unless we knew that people were walking out of Moscow and Leningrad , " DCPA director Tirana told a press conference last year . " I mean ... frankly , it is very , very risky . and I would hope that the existence of the plan itself would diminish or eradicate any possibility of the Soviet Union ever using its capability or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some advantage . " In other words . the argument goes like this : if we do n't have CRP. the Soviet Union could evacuate its cities , do something provocative , and dare us to attack , knowing that we could n't evacuate our cities f except spontaneously and haphazardly ) in preparation for their counterattack . If we do have CRP. and the Soviet Union evacuates its cities and does something provocative . then we could evacuate our cities . giving the Russians goal reason to think we would dare to attack . How- ever , since the Russians would be well aware that we have CRP and could match their evacuation with our evacuation , they would be less likely to evacuate in the first place , or . for that matter , to do something provocative . Thus , if we have CRP , it is unlikely that we will need it . We need it only if we do n't have it . And we do n't have it . So we need it . Not everyone agrees with this logic . " It 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " If they evacuate , ue have them in a blackmail situation . How long can they sit out in the countryside with their cities and all their industries sitting idle ? " The entire issue was carried to the White House in late 1977 , when a National . Security Council working group . chaired by Samuel Huntington , director of the Center for international Affairs at Harvard . launched a policy review of civil defense . It concluded that civil defense is an element in the strategic balance and that ( Continued on page 90 ) ( Continuedfrom page 40 ) CRP should proceed in order to reduce the possibility of America 's being coerced in a time of crisis . In September , President Carter signed a secret Presidential Directive ( PD-411 accepting that conclusion . Scion after , the news broke that Carter had approved a new $2 billion civil-defense program . The figure was based on Defense Department estimates of what it would cost over a seven-year period to develop effective crisis relocation plans and continue to fund other civil-defense activities at the current rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signed had contained no dollar figure . In a period of austerity , the reports of $2 billion for civil defense were an embarrassment . At a November 30 press conference , Carter called the reports " completely erroneous . " Several weeks later , a Defense Department proposal to ask Congress for $145 million for civil defense in fiscal 1980 ( up from $98 million in 1979 ) was cut back to $108.6 million . So CRP proceeds , but it proceeds slowly , its future not yet assured . " My budget is increased in this extreme austerity year . " Tirana said in February . " Why ? I assume because I need to begin carrying out the President 's policy directive . ... But . to make CRP effective . we must spend $230 million a year over the next five years , with additional expenses in the sixth and seventh years .... ' The bottom-line question is : Do you want to spend $2 billion to make sure the Russians do n't walk out of Moscow ? " C HRIST ALMIGHTY ! " Lt.

In that time , the military command has to discern the attack at its headquarters in Colorado , and then notify Albany , and they notify us , and we have to notify fifty-six precincts to turn on the sirens , and the people who hear them will run into buildings and will be turned to sand in a few seconds anyway .

" I have doubts about New York , " he said , " but . mechanically , I think it can be done . New York City evacuates a few million people every day after work . At least in theory , you can do it . " A preliminary study of evacuating New York done for the DCPA last year concluded that 11.33 million people in the metropolitan area could be evacuated in 3.3 days , using cars , trucks , buses , trains , planes , and boats .

And so on .
