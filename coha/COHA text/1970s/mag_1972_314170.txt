EVERY Administration has its in-house contact with big business-a staff aide or presidential intimate to hear the complaints , plead the cases and soothe the ruffled feathers of the fat cats and Pooh-Bahs . The position naturally invites allegations of mollycoddling business at public expense . But few who have held it have proved more controversial or more subject to charges of favoritism than Peter Flanigan , Richard Nixon 's " Mr. Fixit " when it comes to powerful business interests . <P> A millionaire former Wall Street investment banker ( Dillon Read ) , Flanigan , 48 , is variously regarded as a mischievous genius of finance , a wheeler-dealer and the business community 's best friend at the White House . According to Ralph Nader , Flanigan is the " most evil " man in Washington because he so often appears to be responsible for shifts in presidential policy favorable to business . <P> When the ITT brouhaha arose , many predicted that it was only a matter of time before Flanigan 's name surfaced-and with good reason . Since he was appointed a presidential assistant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every controversy about business influence involving the Nixon Administration . Two of Flanigan 's more notable shenanigans : <P> &gt; In 1970 he was accused of using improper influence to gain a Treasury Department waiver permitting an oil tanker to engage in coastal shipping trade , thereby increasing the ship 's value by $5,000,000 . The tanker , it was discovered , was owned by officials of Dillon Read . Flanigan too had held a share in the vessel and had disposed of it only five days before the waiver was granted . Flanigan 's reply : " I did not even know Treasury was considering a waiver . " <P> &gt; When a Government task force recommended elimination of the quotas on oil imports two years ago , the domestic oil industry , which stood to lose billions of dollars , was up in arms . Anticipating the repercussions among oil-rich G.O.P. campaign contributors , the President ordered a new " study " of oil-import quotas . Not surprisingly , the second commission disagreed completely with its predecessor and recommended the retention of the tariffs . Though not officially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second task force 's deliberations that one participant remarked , " I thought he was a member . " Pointedly , it was Non-Member Flanigan who informed the group of the decision it was supposed to make . <P> Flanigan 's rejoinder to his critics in such cases is that " every decision that I have made I believe has been made in the public interest . " It is a fact , moreover , that despite his obvious business bias , he is often hard-boiled with businessmen . Besides , Flanigan does frequently take the rap for decisions made higher up in the White House , where his loyalty is above question . He is extremely close to the President . He headed " Citizens for Nixon " in 1960 , and when Nixon moved to New York after his defeat in California in 1962 . Flanigan helped him raise funds for other Republican candidates during the five-year span when such activity was Nixon 's only political lifeline .
