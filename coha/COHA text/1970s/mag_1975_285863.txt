Though it controls the nation 's purse strings , Congress has long been outmatched by the Executive Branch in brainpower for evaluating federal spending proposals . Only a few Senators and Representatives have acquired much proficiency in economics , and the Administration can overwhelm them with spending and revenue estimates prepared by the Office of Management and Budget and the Council of Economic Advisers-in all , an apparatus of some 700 people . This year the imbalance has been lessened by the new Congressional Budget Office and its articulate , politically liberal director , Economist Alice Mitchell Rivlin . <P> The CBO was set up as part of the new budgetary process under which Congress votes spending and deficit ceilings rather than passing appropriations bills in disorderly bits and pieces . Rivlin 's job is to systematically analyze the probable effects of various choices on the economy . As she puts it , " Congress has always had a lot of power over the budget , but it was not organized to think ' Is that really what we want to do ? ' " <P> Rivlin operates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former Carroll Arms Hotel ; her desk occupies the spot where a bar once catered to thirsty Senators . She has spent most of her three months on the job assembling a staff of 200 , including some top economists . They will be kept busy in the next few months . A typical task will come this summer , when Congress , in a move to combat unemployment , will decide whether to spend more on public works or simply send more revenue-sharing funds to state and local governments , or combinations of both . Rivlin 's staff will analyze the costs of both programs in order to provide Congress with objective standards for a choice . <P> By the end of this month , the CBO staff will produce budget estimates and an economic forecast for 1976 . In the fall , using tallies and economic models prepared at Rivlin 's behest by Chase Econometrics , Data Resources Inc. and the Wharton School , Congress will add up what it has actually appropriated in voting on separate bills and act to bring the total under the agreed-upon deficit ceiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : as a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution , she co-authored studies of the 1972 , 1973 and 1974 budgets under the title Setting National Priorities . She has spent 18 years as a professional budget watcher , part of it as an Assistant Secretary of Health , Education and Welfare , helping to plan Lyndon Johnson 's Great Society programs . <P> The daughter of a physicist , a Bryn Mawr alumna and a Radcliffe Ph.D . in economics , Rivlin , 44 , is the wife of a Washington lawyer and the mother of three children-whose tasks have been lightened by housekeepers throughout her career . She became interested in economics during a summer course at Indiana University . Says she : " It seemed less fuzzy than history or political science . " Short ( 5 ft. 2 in. ) and an impeccable dresser , Rivlin is regarded by colleagues as even-tempered and firm but not stubborn .
