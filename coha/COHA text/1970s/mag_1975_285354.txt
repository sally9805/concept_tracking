Alternately sipping black coffee and puffing on his pipe , White House Chief of Staff Donald Rumsfeld talked with TIME Washington Correspondent Dean Fischer about his perceptions of Gerald Ford as President : <P> <P> He likes to keep things moving . White House Press Secretary Ron Nessen may have a question about a piece of legislation , and the President will say , " Well , let 's get so-and-so in here and find out about it . " I can sit down with him and run down 40 items in 30 minutes . The President does n't like things hanging around a long time . <P> He 's not selfconscious . He 's comfortable with people and very much at ease even if he has n't met an individual before . We can bring in an expert , and the President is not inhibited from exploring an issue he 's interested in . Nor does his demeanor prevent anyone from frankly discussing a problem . He 's not as reserved as many people in high office . He 's relaxed and outgoing . <P> When we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vail , Colo. , the caretaker of the house where the President is staying walked in to get a pair of ski boots . The President paused and introduced him around the room . That put everybody at ease . <P> Twenty-four to 48 hours prior to those meetings , lengthy papers came in summarizing the work done in the interim-as I recall , a 58-page paper on energy , a somewhat shorter paper on the economy . I gave them to the President and he read them . I remember the President once said that he is a better listener than he is a reader . I have not found that to be the case . He 'll take a thick stack of papers and read them after dinner . It is clear that he reads them because I 'll get handwritten notes or questions he scrawled in the margins throughout his evening of work . <P> He 's a do-it-now kind of person . The other day , on the spur of the moment , he picked up the telephone and called a Senator who opposed a veto of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violently opposed to a bill he signs , the President may call him up to explain his reasoning . You do n't get to be minority leader of the U.S. House of Representatives without being one hell of an able guy . The President is not smooth in the modern sense of the word , but the House is a pretty tough league . <P> I 've seen him get a little angry on two or three occasions . In each case his irritation was well merited . If his schedule gets fouled up and people are kept waiting , he expresses his dissatisfaction . He also has a not unreasonable degree of impatience . <P> The President 's gregarious nature does not interfere with the flow of White House business . On the contrary , I 'd say his many friends are helpful to him . He has so many people calling him or writing him notes that it gives him what he wants , namely , multiple sources of information . <P> <P> Fischer recalled that Rumsfeld worked for Jerry Ford the minority leader when Rumsfeld was an Illinois @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President . Has there been any basic change in his approach ? <P>
