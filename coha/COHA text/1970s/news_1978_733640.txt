Miss Barak was permitted to retain the proceeds of checks for $3,000 on Dec. 10 , 1976 , and $2,100 on June 8 , 1977. typed by her mother and signed by Paul Garrett , and the $100 a week paid her from Oct. 10 , 1976 , to Sept. 16 , 1977 , for what her mother said were " little services " to Mr. Garrett . " One-hundred dollars a week may have been rather high for the services she supposedly rendered , " Justice Bloom said . " Notwithstanding , she did render some services , and I would have been inclined to say the conservators had not established their right to claim that " had the trial continued . Mrs. Barak was permitted to retain two 510,000 checks dated December 1975 and December 1976 that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the General Motors stock in 1977 and $3,000 she received in November 1976 . A $10,000 bonus on Mrs. Barak 's salary of approximately $20,000 a year might seem high , but " would not have been so disproportionate as to rule out the possibility or probability that it would have been a Christmas bonus , " Justice Bloom commented . Mr. Garrett still lives in the spacious apartment at 580 Park Avenue he shared with his wife , the late Lillian Riggs Garrett , a painter , composer and former Ziegfeld Follies girl who left him an estate of $5.8 million when she died in 1968 .
