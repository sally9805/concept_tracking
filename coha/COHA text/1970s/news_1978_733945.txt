txt The once-proud nation of Iran is slowly tearing itself apart , and it is difficult to see how anyone can stop it . Trapped between the dangers of continued unrest as Shah Muhammad Reza Pahlavi clings to power and the obvious instability that would result from his departure , it is hard to find any solution that would quickly restore the country to an even keel . Increasingly the mood is that the country will continue to simmer and occasionally boil for many months to come . descending into a situation not far removed from the Lebanese analogy that was suggested as a possibility as much as two months ago . Contrary to the hopes and expectations of those who advise the Shah , the opposition movement is alive and kicking ? and the power of exiled Muslim religious leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeim is far from being on the wane . Nor is there any indication that if the Shah should finally succeed in his desperate attempts to form a civilian government , the opposition would accept it and fade away . According to UPI. quoting Iranian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a proposed new government to be set up under Gholam Hossein Sadighi. who was once imprisoned for his opposition to the Shah // From page 1 Why the Shah may have to go A Sadighi household spokesman said the new government would be composed of Iranians who had not been in government the previous 25 years . " But it would not be a coalition government , " he added . " We have not had any contacts with Karim Sanjabi of the National Front . " The Sadighi plan would reduce the Shah 's role by implementing the 1906 Constitution . But the Shah was reported to have rejected another plan to turn his powers over to a crown council . Most of the people seem to want the Shah to go , and nothing short of that would appear to be acceptable . They only hope that their message finally will reach the Americans ? who they see as the only thing between them and their goal . The Shah has predictably balked at the suggestion put to him that he " disappear " from Iran , claiming illness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a form of regency council under the current Constitution . But the possibility that he eventually will be forced to go , * either as a direct result of opposition pressure or because of a military coup , is becoming increasingly apparent . The Shah is pictured currently as a man of many minds , uncertain of the future course he should take to extricate himself from the current crisis . This could result partly from the conflicting advice he is receiving from the various " brokers " that regularly visit the palace . - Iran 's Ambassador to Washington , Ardeshir Zahedi , one of those currently advising the Shah in Tehran , is firmly opposed to the constitutional disappearing trick , fearing as many do that the already much-troubled armed forces would break apart as soon as the Shah left . But there seem to be increasing indications that the armed forces . might eventually break apart anyway if the current political and economic crisis continues . It may be significant that , for the first time in the current crisis , military discipline appeared to break down in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dozen soldiers of an Army unit put down their weapons and marched with anti-Shah demonstrators . Officials in Tehran denied , however , that it was a major mutiny or that many soldiers joined the protesters . And the more the Shah stalls , the more he puts in jeopardy his hopes of ever effecting a transition to his son , Crown Prince Reza , now 18 . Ayatollah Khomeini has declared that he seeks an Islamic republic to replace the Shah , but most opposition figures are known to favor continuation of the monarchy . They fear that should the monarchy be ended there would be no stabilizing force at the head of Iranian politics and the country would disintegrate into anarchy . The great problem with the Shah 's current search for a civilian government to replace the increasingly divided and unpopular military-led one is that there is not a political figure left with the charisma to counter that of Ayatollah Khomeini . Such people were effectively silenced in the past by the secret police , and it would take a long period of political in-fighting before a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrounding the Shah fail to realize is that the opposition now runs too deep for any of the simple remedies that might have worked before . The long list of broken promises , the way the royal family was allowed to dig its hands deep into the national coffers , and the way security forces currently are treating the people , basically brutally where clashes arise , have turned the masses , the middle class , and even some of the elite firmly against him . Tehran 's great cemetery to the south of the city , Behesht Zahra , is the last haven of freedom for those who seek the Shah 's overthrow . For instance , as the Iranian capital was closed down Dec. 18 by yet another general strike called by religious leaders to mourn last week 's riot victims , thousands gathered in the cemetery to bury victims of the country 's sporadic violence . Throughout the often highly emotional scenes not one soldier was to be seen . The only military presence was in the sky where helicopters were flying across the cemetery to keep an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angry fists rose into the air and the crowd again called for the Shah 's demise .
