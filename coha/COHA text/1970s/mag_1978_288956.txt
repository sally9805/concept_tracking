Senior executives of Textron Inc. still shudder to remember the ride that Bill Miller , then company chairman , took them on last October . After visiting buyers of Textron rolling mills in Yugoslavia and Poland , they were supposed to fly to Vienna , but their plane was grounded by fog . So Miller herded them aboard a bus for a 14-hour trip through Czechoslovakia . The roads were rough and visibility near zero , but Miller , sitting beside the driver , issued a steady stream of instructions about how to steer through tight turns . Periodically , he had the bus stopped so that he could loosen up with calisthenics , and everybody else could get over the shakes . <P> The ride was symbolic of the task that now faces Miller . <P> His formal training for determining how much money the economy needs about equals his knowledge of Czech roads . But he speaks with an assurance that might seem like egotism - if it were not for all those stories around Textron of Miller riding the bus to work , lunching at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself that a subordinate should have done . Instead , Miller combines a casual openness with almost supreme self-confidence . Says Textron Senior Vice President John B. Henderson : " It does not occur to him that there is anything he can not do . " <P> Miller began developing that blend early . When he was an infant , his storekeeper father moved the family from Bill 's birthplace of Sapulpa , Okla. , to Borger , a Texas Panhandle town so new that it had no jail ; prisoners were chained to a log . Says Miller : " It was a life of Depression , Dust Bowl and frontier . But that environment creates strong individuals . " <P> An older brother set an example of success by going to Annapolis . But , uncertain whether he would be accepted into the Naval Academy , Miller borrowed a car , drove to Santa Fe and took the exam for the Coast Guard Academy . He passed , and at 17 found himself training aboard a Danish sailing ship out of New London , Conn . The discipline , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he began " to understand the techniques of making an organization work . " Graduating in 1945 , he got to Japan just after the war ended . A year later , at 20 , he was given command of a landing craft , with a crew of 30 , to bring through the Panama Canal to Galveston and mothballing . <P> Then the Coast Guard sent him to Shanghai , where Miller saw a society that was crumbling , in part because of runaway inflation ; the rate of price increases that summer of 1946 hit 2,000%. * He also met Ariadna Rogajarski , a White Russian who had been born in Manchuria and had been living in Shanghai under the Japanese occupation . They married , and the young officer-who is still addressed as George by old friends-began calling himself G. William Miller . His bride found Bill much easier to pronounce than George .
