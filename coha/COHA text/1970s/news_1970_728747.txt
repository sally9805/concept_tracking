txt Seventy million Americans live in families having incomes between $5,000 and $10,000 , and they are " overripe for political response . " Their breadwinner is the celebrated forgotten man . Today Bill Jones is angry , frustrated , and confused . He belongs to the lower-middle-income group . He does n't know what is happening to him , but he feels something is wrong somewhere . This group has just had its collective picture taken by an administration study group . Under the photograph is appended the title , " The blue-collar worker . " There are a lot of statistics , a lot of explanations of how the blue-collar worker got that way . But there are not many solutions . What does emerge is that the politically sensitive group  --  whose study is signed by Jerome M. Rosow , assistant secretary of labor for policy , evaluation , and research , and by outgoing Secretary of Labor George P. Shultz , and is addressed to John D. Ehrlichman at the White House  --  sees political gold in the situation . Incomes compared " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they feel so keenly , " says the report , Race problems are involved . A third of the $5,000-$10,000 families are Negro . But the Negro family median income is $5,590 , whereas the white family 's is $8,937 . Pressing against the blue-collar whites are the poor below them , pushing up from the ghetto , demanding better pay and better jobs and a chance to join segregated trade unions . These are the low-income blacks . The whites are often first- or second-generation immigrants . They are insecure and trying to get a firm economic position . When they ca n't and when they see poverty groups getting federal aid which is cut off from them because they are self-supporting , they are angry . They are the steel against which the black flint strikes . B ill Jones is fighting for middle-class values : law and order , higher education , a better place for his children . He is the angry man in the hard hat watching the students ' parade go by with its mock Viet Cong banners . The new report does n't go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worker 's being " overripe for a political response . " But Washington believes the blue-collar workers have been loosened from their old love affair with Democrats and are politically available  --  maybe for George C. Wallace  --  maybe , who knows , for the Republicans . The toughest part for Bill Jones , who may be a typical steelworker in Pittsburgh , is after he gets married . Now he has a couple of children and a nice new mortgage . His pay makes little accommodation to increased responsibilities . Most other democracies give something like family allowances : so much per month per child as they do in Canada . Nothing like that in America . " The American wage and salary structure does not respond directly to this situation , " the report says , " since it is based on the ethic of ' equal pay for equal work . ' " There is some slight flexibility in income-tax exemptions , but for the most part Bill Jones is worse off the older his children get : " He begins to be squeezed in his later 30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach their teens . " So what then ? About the only thing he can do , says the report , is demand higher wages , always higher wages . Yet , the report notes , because of inflation since 1965 , " real earnings measured in true purchasing power remain almost static . These men are on a treadmill , chasing the illusion of higher living standards . "
