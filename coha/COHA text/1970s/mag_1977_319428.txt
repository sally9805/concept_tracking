Like some last-minute Christmas shopper scrambling to get it all done in time , Jimmy Carter managed to meet his deadline : he got his full Cabinet named by Dec. 25 . The final announcements came last week in three televised presentations at Carter headquarters in Plains , and the biggest of the " surprises " so often forecast by the President-elect 's aides was that there were so few surprises . With 18 top jobs filled , including all twelve Cabinet positions and the main economic and national-security slots , it was clear that the man who had campaigned as Mr. Outside wanted men ( and women ) around him who were politically in or near the center , fixers , doers and organizers-not ideologues . <P> The phrase that Carter used repeatedly in introducing his Cabinet choices was " tough , competent managers . " That was a fair collective description of the appointees who are to join Carter on Sea Island , Ga. , for three days this week . <P> Tough Infighting . The accent was on experience . Seven of Carter 's 18 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Three were announced earlier : Cyrus Vance as Secretary of State , Charles Schultze as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers , and W. Michael Blumenthal as Treasury Secretary . Four more veterans were tapped last week . <P> First Carter named as Defense Secretary Harold Brown , president of the California Institute of Technology , who headed weapons research at the Pentagon in the McNamara years . In his final session , after a quick trip to Chicago for the funeral of Mayor Richard Daley , Carter named three more old hands . To run Health , Education and Welfare , Carter recruited Joseph Califano , Lyndon Johnson 's domestic policy chief . To head the energy agency that he hopes to expand into a Cabinet department , Carter chose his house Republican , James Schlesinger , whose resume is getting to be as lengthy as Elliot Richardson 's . One baffling choice : he picked New York Attorney Theodore Sorensen to run the Central Intelligence Agency ; though experienced around Washington as John F. Kennedy 's chief aide and speechwriter , Sorensen seemed to have little obvious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proven experience among other nominees . Minnesota Congressman Bob Bergland , his prospective Agriculture Secretary , is a real farmer . Carter also managed , finally , to find women for his Cabinet : black Washington Attorney Patricia Harris , who will be Secretary of Housing and Urban Development ; and Economist Juanita Kreps , named to Commerce . <P> The final lineup was the result of tough infighting among competing interests , and fancy-even tricky-maneuvering on Carter 's part . The most egregious example was his appointment as Attorney General : Griffin Bell , a former federal appeals-court judge . Black leaders were outraged at the choice ( see box opposite page ) . <P> Bell is something of a crony of Carter 's , and in that sense the appointment is not unprecedented ; Carter recalled John F. Kennedy 's appointment of his brother Robert , and joked that his own brother Billy was in line for the job as soon as he got his law degree . But Carter had seemed to promise more than a comfortable ally in such a crucial post .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
