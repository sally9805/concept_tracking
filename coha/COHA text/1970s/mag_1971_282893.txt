There is nothing new , or even particularly secret , about the hundreds of thousands of Mexican " wetbacks " ( mojados , as they are known to their Chicano cousins ) , who have swum the Rio Grande or simply walked into the U.S. at some point along the hundreds of miles of largely unpatrolled border . Nor is there much that the badly undermanned U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service can do about keeping the immigrants out . The " illegals " who are caught-some 320,000 during the last fiscal year-are simply sent back across the border . The people who employ , encourage and often exploit them , are , for all practical purposes , beyond the reach of the law . <P> Last week , acting on a tip , immigration agents raided Ramona 's Mexican Food Products Company , a food processing firm in suburban Los Angeles . According to federal officials , Ramona 's is " an indiscriminate employer of illegal aliens . " Five times in the last four years the company had been raided , and each time agents had turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . After half a dozen immigration men burst through the door , the plant 's largely female work force shrieked and started scattering . Eventually , 36 of them were cornered , most of them in the women 's rest room . Perhaps an equal number managed to scramble out the exits to freedom . <P> Political Conspiracy . There the matter would have ended , except that the proprietor of Ramona Foods happens to be Mrs. Romana Banuelos , a Mexican-American businesswoman whom Richard Nixon had just nominated to be the 34th Treasurer of the U.S. George K. Rosenberg , director of the Immigration Service 's Los Angeles office and the man who called the raid , said he did not know Mrs. Banuelos ' identity until after the raid was over . In any case , noted Rosenberg , he had sent a routine letter to Ramona Foods in August 1969 , warning the company to stop employing illegal aliens . <P> Mrs. Banuelos , who began by making tortillas 22 years ago and has built her operation into a $6 million business , saw the affair quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter ; her workers were well treated , she said , although she admitted that she never inquired into their nationality . The whole thing , she insisted , was " part of an attempt by Democrats to block my nomination as Treasurer of the U.S. " <P> Mrs. Banuelos ' bland assertion that she had been the victim of a political conspiracy seemed preposterous . But TIME 's Eleanor Hoover learned that the choice of Mrs. Banuelos ' plant was no accident . The tipster , Hoover reports , was Harry Bernstein , the respected labor editor of the Los Angeles Times and a recent crusader against illegal aliens . The day before the raid , Bernstein phoned Rosenberg and told him of the aliens at the Banuelos plant . Bernstein did not tell Rosenberg who the president of the company was , or where he himself had received his information . Gratefully , Rosenberg invited Bernstein along on the raid , and allowed him to bring a Times photographer .                    @
