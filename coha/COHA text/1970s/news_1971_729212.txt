txt " It all begins in the school , " said the white-haired Ulster father , a Protestant . " I remember when our five-year-old daughter came home from school one day and asked : ' What is a Catholic ? ' " " We told her a Catholic was just somebody who went to a different church . " But his thoughtful pause , just then , at we talked this week , indicated that there had been other attitudes and other forces and experiences that menace such simple truths in Northern Ireland . Jagged bigotry has long been nurtured here from the very youngest of teachable years . And , as this is written , shock and outrage at new manifestations of child violence grip Belfast . A five-year-old girl at play accidentally ran into the path of a slow-moving British Army scout car Monday and was killed . A small riot developed and then a burst of machine-gun fire , aimed apparently at some local police , struck and wounded four teen-agers instead . // Accusations as well as bullets fly . Some Protestants have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its extremist faction , the Provisionals , have not only stirred children into brick-throwing forays against British troops but have even paid them to do so The IRA and the Provisionals , apparently ringleaders of the current violence , are battling for a single Ireland . They demand an end to the partition of 1920 by which six northern counties were set up under the British crown , and 26 southern counties were given independence as the Republic of Ire-land Their strategy appears to be to provoke heavy-handed retaliation from the Northern Ireland Government and from British troops , and thus bring behind them the mass of Ulster 's Roman Catholics Sense of grievance Whether they succeed hangs in the balance . But they do not seem as yet to have gathered behind them the same mass Catholic outrage which spilled onto Ulster 's streets in August , 1969 . Two great differences exist between the situation then and now ? ? In August . 1969 , the underlying cause of the rioting in which eight persons were killed was a deep sense of grievance among Catholics at their inferior status @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , jobs . The aim then was far more for civil rights than for reunion with the Catholic republic to the south ; indeed , many Catholics opposed reunion . ? Over the past 17 months the Ulster government , under heavy pressure from London , has corrected a number of the more flagrant abuses of Catholic rights  --  eliminating , for example , the limited franchise for local elections  --  and has taken definite steps toward removing other sources of grievance . So a favorite hard-line Protestant slogan , " Not an inch , " has been partially eroded The response of the mass of Ulster Catholics to the continuing fighting will help determine whether enforced moderation has come in time and in a persuasive enough package Meanwhile , the bitterness of half a century of sectarian divisions and strife remains . An enveloping mood , it touches children early , deeply , and long . And today 's use of the children by the anti-Ulster. anti-Protestant extremist forces here is a signal again of how deeply rooted this struggle is . Catholic children , almost to a child , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school . Each develop in the isolated atmosphere of narrow , separate worlds . Their most formative years are subjected to the adult anger and pride of home , neighborhood , school , and often church . Rare are the cases of mixing where varying home attitudes might mingle . As the father quoted notes : " The children are constantly impressed with the idea of their differences instead of with the fact of their common interest and need . " Separate lines Early this year , the Minority Rights Group of London amplified these points in a study of Ulster tension . Its report said : " The Catholic hierarchy , as in many other countries , has insisted that its flock be taught in Catholic schools . This has meant that from the age of five years the two communities have led separate lives in the most formative period . They do not see one another . They are taught different aspects of their joint history . They inherit different cultural outlooks . " It continued , " The Catholic schools receive state support , but there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the Protestant establishment . The government answers that this is simply because more pupils attend Protestant schools . " Powerful cultural , psychological and sociological motivation reinforce it all . The report notes ? " In spite of pressure , not least from the Catholics , that this system should be ended in favor of integrated education , the Roman Catholic Church has remained intransigent . Like many another exiled community  --  this is in essence how it sees itself  --  it has a horror that unless its tenets are rigidly inculcated into its adherents they will gradually succumb to the mores of the major group . " This tough clannishness is matched by equally rigid group solidarity among most Protestants Many Protestants honestly fear their own loss of sect identity ; they fear that should partition be ended all Ireland would become a 3 overwhelmingly Catholic as Northern Ireland today is overwhelmingly Protestant Belfast is 72 percent Protestant ; 28 percent Catholic . Voices of moderation are present ; but they are far from prevailing over the explosiveness of the moment . The loudest sounds continue to be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
