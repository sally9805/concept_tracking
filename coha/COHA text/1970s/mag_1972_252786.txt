ELEANOR : THE YEARS ALONE 368 pages . Norton . $9.95 . <P> <P> Eleanor and Franklin , the first part of this two-volume biography of Mrs. Roosevelt , was last year 's literary success . Not only did it win the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award , but it defeated sex ( Any Woman Can ) and the Mafia ( Honor Thy Father ) to become the year 's top bestseller . <P> Like its subject , it was a doughty , intelligent , enormously likable book . The new volume is in some ways even better since Lash has been much more selective in his use of detail . But in a crucial way . The Years Alone is less interesting . It features the same sturdy central character , but how one misses that old supporting cast ! Gone is the gallery of flamboyant Roosevelt drunks to predictably early graves . The martinet mother-in-law is dead too , and even Cousin Alice Longworth 's acid tongue is inexplicably silent , though she is still alive . Most sorely missed of all is F.D.R. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book . Only traces of his wit remain , such as this prayer for deliverance : " O Lord , make Eleanor tired ! " <P> The Almighty did not comply . <P> Months after her husband 's death Mrs. Roosevelt was in London drafting the Human Rights Declaration for the U.N . Later she was its first U.S. ambassador . A reluctant but realistic cold warrior , she began by making excuses for the Russians , saying that they had " an inferiority complex , " but moved on to blunt confrontations with Andrei Vishinsky , head of the Soviet delegation , over forced repatriation of refugees . <P> With each passing year she became more the beloved public figure she deserved to be . There were still a few catcalls . Westbrook Pegler never stopped calling her " la boca grande , " but fewer listened . In 1949 Cardinal Spellman threw an alarming tantrum over a " My Day " column opposing federal aid to parochial schools . He declared her conduct " unworthy of an American mother " but journeyed to Hyde Park personally to make peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catholic political candidates . Mrs. Roosevelt recorded the scene in a typical , ineffable column : " Miss Thompson came and said : ' Cardinal Spellman is on the porch ! ' We had a pleasant chat and I hope the country proved as much of a tonic for him as it always is for me . " <P> In any controversy she had the knack of simultaneously joining the battle and remaining above it . She needed to , if only to survive her sons ' destructive political forays . In 1948 Elliott 's tenacious effort to draft Eisenhower for the Democrats discomfited his mother as well as President Truman and the general . Lash sums up the situation in 1952 with one terse sentence : " Not only was James for Kefauver and Franklin Jr . Harriman 's campaign manager , but Elliott and John had come out for Eisenhower " ( who was by then the Republican candidate ) . <P> Her own spiritual son was Adlai Stevenson . His idealism and wit rejuvenated her and , as Lash points out , she was flattered by his dependence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pro-Stevenson stand at the 1960 convention as a mistake since it hurt his chance to be Secretary of State . It also dissipated her own power and as Lash notes : " She cared about her influence . "
