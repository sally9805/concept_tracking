" I die , " Paul L. Cabell Jr . wrote to his students , " to emphasize to you and all minority people who ever dream to be free that it can only come through working together . It seems that there is no other way for me to get your attention . " With that , Cabell , the black assistant principal of a racially troubled high school just outside Flint , Mich. , put a shotgun to his head and pulled the trigger . <P> Cabell had apparently been frustrated by the racial incidents at Beecher High School , which has an enrollment of 1,000-65% white and 35% black . First a group of black students refused to attend classes , calling the curriculum irrelevant . Then fistfights between blacks and whites broke out for four days in a row ; one white student was hit over the head with a chair . When he tried to make peace , Cabell , who was 26 , found himself in the middle- " nigger " to some whites and " Uncle Tom " to some blacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the comparatively minor unrest at the school , but it did have a certain brutal eloquence . On the day last week that Cabell 's death was announced over the school 's public address system , some blacks in the cafeteria mistakenly thought a group of whites were applauding his death . The fighting started all over again .
