ONCE I SAW PEOPLE APPLAUD the sky . They were Mexican villagers and Indians crowded into the market town of Miahuatlan in Oaxaca state on a cloudless Saturday morning in March 1970 , and they broke into their spontaneous ovation for the heavens at twenty-seven minutes before noon . At that moment the edge of the sun peered out from behind the moon , where it had been in total eclipse for three minutes and twenty-nine seconds . The applause was not so much a welcome to the reappearing sun as a joyful thank-you to nature for putting on such a glorious show . People who have seen only partial solar eclipses can not know the beauty of the full spectacle because the experience within the path of totality is different not in degree but in kind . On that Saturday in 1970 I stood on a hill above Miahuatlan ? a hill that commands a sweeping view of rugged , arid plains and distant mountains . For some time the light had been fading ever more quickly . Then , with great drama , a nebulous darkness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ umbra , or cone of shadow , whose swift passage over the globe traces the path of the total eclipse . The vast sky of southern Mexico became the dome of a giant planetarium as an unseen hand turned down a cosmic rheostat . The town of Miahuatlan became a model railroad set at my feet , and I experienced a powerful sense of what psychiatrists call " derealization " ? the feeling of external things becoming unreal and weird . And in the next instant , things really did get weird . Suddenly , the surface of the earth was covered by rippling bands of alternating light and shadow : patterns generated by the interaction of light rays from the last remaining points of the disappearing solar crescent with the earth 's upper atmosphere . These " shadow bands " persisted for a timeless interval , absorbing my full attention . Then someone shouted , " Look ! " and I turned my gaze upward and saw for the first time in my life the corona of the sun . High in the sky , for the sun was near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black disc ? surroundAndrew Weil , M.D. is a member of the Institute of Current World Affairs and the author of The Natural Mind : A New Way of Looking at drugs and the Higher Consciousness , ing it , a blaze of silver light of unearthly beauty . The sky was not very dark ; a glowing twilight prevailed with a 360-degree rim of light around the horizon , giving a strong impression of being under a dome . Mercury and Venus were in brilliant view , but the light of the corona was too bright for other stars to be visible . I had never seen Mercury before . There was a quality to those minutes within the umbra that must be like the feelinc , in the eye of a hurricane . After all the dramatic changes of accelerating intensity , everything stopped : there was an improbable sense of peace and equilibrium . Time did not flow . I have no way of comparing those three-and-a-half minutes of clock time to any other three-and-ahalf-rninute interval I have experienced . For the whole time I gazed at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the corona can do no damage to the eyes , and I would not have looked at it any other way . ) Then , all at once , a spot of blinding yellow light appeared , the corona vanished in the glare , shadow bands raced across the landscape once more , and the dome of shadow WHEN THE SUN DIES melted away to the east . It was then that all of MiahuatlAn broke into applause . For hours afterward , everyone I saw on the streets wore a radiant smile . Even some of the scientists who had barricaded themselves into regimented observation posts in order to study the eclipse were transfigured . People were high , and it showed in their faces . My experience in MiahuatlAn affected rue powerfully . For one thing , I became an overt eclipse freak , eager to put myself again in the path of the umbra . In Mexico I met people who had followed total solar eclipses around the earth all their lives ; I now understood that passion . When I heard that a long eclipse would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be there . More than anything else , the splendor of the eclipse had impressed me . There was nothing at all terrifying ? no plunge into scary blackness as fictional accounts of eclipses would have us believe . The reaction of people in the shadow was to get high on the strangeness and beauty of the event . rI HENEVER AN ECLIPSE IS visible in America , newspapers chuckle about Indians who think dragons are swallowing the sun . In fact , civilized Americans seem to be more peculiar about eclipses than the Indians I saw in Mexico . The path of totality of that same 1970 eclipse crossed the southeastern corner of the United States , entering the country at northwest Florida and leaving at Virginia Beach . The same newspapers that made fun of uncivilized natives carried horrifying warnings about the dangers of looking at the eclipse . Some medical experts urged the public to stay away entirely from the umbral zone , as if merely being near it were unhealthy . Evidence of this phobia is provided by a remarkable document sent to me on my return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Department of Justice . It is an official Justice Department document titled " Memorandum to All Employees ( Legal and Administrative Activities ) ; Subject : Safe Viewing of the Eclipse " and is dated March 2 , 1970 . The memorandum is signed " Charles M. Odell , Chief , Personnel Operations Section , Administrative Division . " It reads as follows : The purpose of this memorandum is to alert Department employees and their families of the impending eclipse of the sun , due Saturday , March 7th , at approximately 1:30 p.m . This fascinating but dangerous sight will last for three minutes ? time to do irreparable damage to the eyes . The eye damage hazard is due to the fact that the sun can be looked at without discomfort during an eclipse . Normally the dazzling visible rays prevent anyone from looking directly at the sun . Although the visible rays are blocked during an eclipse , the harmful , invisible infra-red rays continue to be emitted , and can cause damaging burns to the retina , the delicate inner layer of the eye which transmits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pain , so a retinal burn is not " felt . " But retinal burns can not be cured , and produce a permanent blind spot in the vic tim 's field of vision in the vital small area used for reading and " fine " seeing . " There is no safe way to view the eclipse directly , " says the National Society for the Prevention of Blindness . " The public must he made aware that the so-called protective devices , such as sunglasses , smoked glass , or film negatives dO not protect the eye from the invisible infra-red rays which do the damage . " A safe indirect method of viewing the eclipse , recommended by the Prevention of Blindness Society , is a simple projection device which can be made by taking two pieces of white card . board , making a pinhole in one and with the sun at your back , focus the eclipse through the pinhole onto the second board . The size of the image can he changed by altering the distance between the boards . However , the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some newspaper articles , a variant of the cardboard projection device was suggested : the viewer was told to put the pinhole in one end of a cardboard carton and put the carton over his head ; the projected image could then be viewed safely and clearly within a miniature , portable theater . This device was used by many persons on the beaches of Virginia . Now , it seems to me that people who put cardboard boxes over their heads to avoid looking at the beauty of a total eclipse ought not to go around making fun of other people 's beliefs about eclipses . I am not certain . but I suspect that one does not get high off an eclipse while hiding under a box , and I am pretty sure that the effect does not come through at all on television . 1V17gArRe Na-tI N Gi s pc : eFt S SeO R pT u bhl iacdon When I returned from Mexico and told people I had looked at the eclipse directly , many said , " You did ? And you can still see ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting for their sight to fail simply because they had glanced up at the sky while driving during the height of the partial eclipse in New York and Boston . It is true that careless staring at the crescent sun during the partial phase of a solar eclipse can lead to a retinal burn , but the most elementary precautions ( such as using exposed film and looking at the sun in brief glimpses I reduce this risk to zero . And I repeat that one can look with the unprotected eye for the entire period of totality . There is no medical justification for telling people not to watch eclipses . I was curious to know why the medical profession had spread such fear and why the Justice Department had bothered itself about a solar eclipse . Are eclipses dangerous in some way to the established order of society ? I think they may be , and to get more information on that possibility I placed myself within the path of totality of the solar eclipse of June 3 ( 1 of this year . The shadow of that eclipse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the coast of Mauritania , swept across central Africa , and found me in a Gabra camp in the middle of the Chalbi Desert in Kenya 's Northern Frontier District . The Chalbi is a baked wasteland of intense heat , wild winds , and occasional waterholes . For at least four years it has been in the grip of a killing drought that shows no signs of letting up , and the people who live there are near the edge of starvation . The Gabra are a nomadic tribe of camel herders who move their camps every few weeks in search of forage for their livestock . They live in small round huts constructed of hides on frames of interlaced poles . When the camp isready to move , the women take the huts apart and pack them onto the camels . The camp 1 was in had twenty huts arranged in a straight line , their doors facing west . In hack of this row of homes were several small corrals made of thornbush in which young camels were kept while their parents were driven each day to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human presence on the desert landscape . Each day the Gabra had to walk several hours to Maikona , a well complex , to water their animals and fill their water jars . Each morning before sunrise the herd-boys went off with a parade of camels , and each evening around sunset they returned . The people of this tiny settlement worked hard all the time merely to survive in their hostile environment . There were no days of rest , no letups in the daily routine of milking the camels , leading them to food and water , and collecting water for the camp . At the time of my arrival , these Gabra had eaten no meat in many weeks and no cornmeal in a month . Even in times of plenty they do not eat fish , fowl , fruit , or vegetables . Now , in a time of great hardship , they were surviving on camel milk and tea . I arrived in the camp two days before the eclipse , along with an anthropologist , three other Americans , and two translators high-school boys of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although they had grown up in towns and never lived in traditional Gabra camps . We were part of a larger expedition to study the impact of the eclipse on the Borana -- -a cattle-herding people of northern Kenya and southern Ethiopia who intermingle with the Gabra . The Borana have a sophisticated cosmology that attributes great significance ( mostly negative ) to eclipses . Most of our group was scattered in Borana camps on the fringes of the Marsabit National Reserve , an island of green adjoining the Chalbi Desert . The Borana looked sleeker than the Gabra and certainly were living on better land . I chose to be out in the Chalbi mainly because the desert landscape seemed better fur eclipse-viewing . I was interested more in the sun than in either the Borana or Gabra and was willing to endure the hostility of the Chalbi for a better show . The chief of our camp , a handsome man named Duba who had once served in the native colonial police force , gave us permission to set up a tent and stay . In fact , we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree on the arid , rolling plain . It was a gnarled , stunted tree with microscopic leaves , but its branches offered the only shade within walking distance of the huts . Our tent proved to he unlivably hot ( tile Gabra huts were much cooler ) , so the tree was truly a blessing . Often we would spend the hottest part of the day inching along the dry ground to follow the meager shadows as the earth turned . There were few insects to bother us ; the high winds counteracted the enervation of the heat , and at night the stars were spectacular . From time to time , a hyena or an ostrich would come near the camp , and vultures circled during the day . N FRIDAY , JUNE 29 , when the kfipower of the sun was diminishing in the late afternoon , I sat talking with an elder of the camp who was carving a camel bell out of a piece of wood and with two younger men . The older man , who said he was sixty , was very thin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the past he had served a term as leader of rituals for his section of the tribe . One of the younger men asked me if I knew when the eclipse was going to happen . It was not surprising that these Gabra knew of the eclipse . The Kenyan government had made a great effort to alert all of the populace to it and , in particular , to warn people not to watch it lest they go blind . These warnings had been disseminated in leaflets , through schools , on radios , and by native policemen . The Gabra of our camp had doubtless heard of the event at the Maikona well complex . I replied that the eclipse was due at four in the afternoon . " What do you think will happen ? " I asked . The answer surprised me : " We have heard that the government is going to cause the sun to die . " I asked whether anyone had ever seen such a thing . The old man said that his great-grandfather had mentioned an eclipse of the sun . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have never experienced it . " He went on to say that his people did have experience of times tality is that the light gets very dim in one way while remaining brilliant in another . In the sky the slender solar crescent is still too blinding to look at directly , and shadows on the ground are as crisp and dark as on the brightest summer day . But the quality of the light is altogether different ? like super-bright moonlight . I found myself looking at my hands and arms , at the huts , at the ground , even at the film crew . I wanted to see as much as possible under this novel illumination . It is a living paradox , bright yet dim , like no other light I have ever seen . And it changes very fast , which adds to the novelty . As the cone of shadow approaches , a sense of drama builds : something is going to happen . The light fades faster and faster , retaining that curious ghost of solar brightness to the last . Finally , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the glaring yellow light of the 5L111 reduced to a single point ? an effect known to eclipse-watchers as the " diamond ring . " Then the moon rolled directly in front of the sun , the silvery-white corona appeared , and once again I was in the umbra . IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE ECLIPSE a ' woman who was part of our group asked how long we had been in the shadow ; to her it had seemed like thirty seconds . But someone with a watch had timed it at three-and-ahalf minutes . The woman said , " I want more of it . " A young man who was with us , as the light was becoming ordinary again , said , " Already it seems like a dream ; I remember it exactly the way I remember dreams . " Reality inside the umbra is not ordinary reality ; the dreamlike quality is one manifestation of the difference . Another is the sense of improbability permeating a still point in the midst of opposing forces . The hurricane 's eye must be as improbable : a cylinder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very center of a system of frenzied energies . In the path of a total eclipse one has the privilege of sharing the perfect alignment of earth , moon , and sun . For a brief interval out of time , the three bodies are frozen in majestic union ; then they go on their separate , complicated courses . To participate in that moment of uncanny equilibrium is to have one 's faith strengthened in the possibility of equilibrium and to experience the paradox that balance and stillness are to be found at the heart of all change . Recurrent in the philosophies and myths of peoples around the world are themes of the union of sun and moon , symbolic of the union of conscious and unconscious forces within the human psyche that must take place if one is to become whole . The light of the corona ? peaceful , cool , silver-white , normally invisible in the glare of the day ? is a perfect representation of the intuitive consciousness that normally is hidden in the glare of ordinary mental activity . It is that hidden consciousness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hypnosis , and other techniques that focus attention or shake us out of ordinary perceptions . And whenever we make that contact ? whenever there is an interchange of masculine and feminine energies within our minds ? we get high . A total eclipse is one great natural high . One way to avoid the power of an eclipse is to photograph it . I observed in Africa that the people who spent the precious time of totality taking pictures were visibly less moved by the event than others . In a similar way , scientists who study eclipses shield themselves from the experience by looking at instruments instead of the sky . They can not possibly he surprised by the appearance of night in day . In Mexico I spent the afternoon before the eclipse at the scientific compound of a major American expedition , watching the astronomers rehearse what they would he doing during totality . They had recorded on tape the sound of a hammer striking an anvil as a monotone voice chanted the elapsed time in seconds . To this unnerving accompaniment , suggestive of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around like robots , their eyes fixed always on their machines . Meanwhile , outside the walled compound , gleeful Mexicans ran about shooting off skyrockets and having the time of their lives in celebration of all the activity that had come to their town . The chief scientist was furious about the rockets . " Ca n't you stop them ? " he kept shouting . " They 'll ruin our measurements ! " I decided I would be far better able to enjoy the eclipse away from the measurers and chose my hill accordingly . Scientists and photographers hide from eclipses behind their instruments , Others simply hide ? under a cardboard box or in a hut . Several Borana elders told me that the last total eclipse over their land , two generations ago , caught people unawares in open country , where they crouched down and waited until it was over , then appealed to their ritual leaders for interpretation . This time , advised by the government in Nairobi of the danger of blindness due on Saturday , June 30 , at 4:00 P.M. , most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their huts when the sun began to " get sick " and could not be coaxed out until the light returned . According to a story in the East African Standard of July 2 , " Once the sun was more than half covered , most of the women of the Samburu and Turkana tribes moved into their huts , and the less sophisticated El Molo shut themselves up completely in their palm-fronded igloos , ' placing cardboard or a piece of sacking over the entrance . " The government predicted the eclipse . The eclipse happened . Therefore , the government caused it . And by warning people not to look at it , the Kenyan authorities took advantage of the moon 's shadow in order to strengthen their control over the tribes ? another step in the transfer of power from local , tribal rule to central , urban rule . IN THE MEMORANDUM of the Justice Department , nature is conceived as a hostile trickster , luring us to destruction with " fascinating but dangerous " sights . One might almost think that our government ? jealous of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eclipses . When events have the potential to get us high by interrupting the ordinary , orderly flow of everyday reality , they are especially threatening to the men in power , who want us to feel threatened along with them . " There is no safe way to view the eclipse directly , " says the Justice Department . " The best way to view the eclipse is on television . " Best for whom ? As for me , l will just use my eyes . According to the Canon of Solar Eclipses for the Year 1974 , the southwest corner of Australia will he grazed by a total eclipse next June 20 . See you in the umbra ?
