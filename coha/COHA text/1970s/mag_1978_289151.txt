The woman , naturally , is in the back of the elevator , since the men all stood aside to allow her to enter first . When the elevator door opens on the eighth floor : <P> a ) The men all inhale deeply and , rolling their eyes to the ceiling and fluttering their hands in the vicinity of their heads , attempt to crowd aside so that the one woman , in the fragility of her gender , may exit first , followed by eight men and their dense exhalation of martini fumes . b ) Since the sex of the passengers is irrelevant here , everyone leaves the elevator in the most efficient and logical order , the men nearest the door departing first . As some people of both sexes are still uncomfortable with such uncourtly procedures , a man may put them at their ease by making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ c ) All passengers tumble out at once , landing in a heap before the eighth-floor receptionist . <P> 2 .

It has become extremely complicated to be polite in America . There was a time when the upwardly mobile and socially inecure believed as fervently as The Four Hundred that there existed somewhere-in the mind of God , perhaps , or the graven tablets of Emily Post-an absolute standard of The Correct . All contingencies were covered in this elaborate system of law , as refined as the Talmud and sometimes as difficult to interpret . But trying to cultivate manners today is like buying a house in Grosse Pointe and discovering that the previous tenants were the Symbionese Liberation Army : the place is a mess . The old fixtures do n't work ; the walls are smeared with ego ; the foundation is crumbling and practically gone . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been unraveling for years , of course . But to many of the young in the ' 60s , the laid-back luftmenschen of the counterculture , manners were as superfluous as flatware at McDonald 's ( the late 20th century 's reversion to its fingers ) or linen napkins at the Donner Pass .
