In the color set in the airport luncheonette , the news was breaking up . The President appeared in pink , with a purple hash mark across his skin , so I reached forward to adjust the knobs . The waitress smiled , " Do n't change it : it 's better that way . " Moment of realization : it was true . Television 's magic is the transformation of images . The eye is captured by the constantly shifting reality that engages it . Take away literal content , but leave the unfolding images . and the eye remains entranced : that 's why so many people it in self-disgust watching elevisiort shows they 've een before , or tolerating the thinnest kind of intellecI.ual gruel , or simply lookmg with the sound . urned off . The acceptance of televi-1 ion as an image machine is ipening new avenues out of ) anality . The realization hat content is secondary , ndireet , implicit , has sent a iew artistic vitality pulsing hrough television ? one hat still has few outlets art that promises , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commercial television , as much an accepted form as the format of evening news shows . What appears now on occasional half-hour shows on the educational stations such as WGBH , WHET , and KQED will soon be familiar fare . The shift is announced semantically by the substitution of video for television . Video expands the universe of image transfOrmations , swells the repertoire of possible manipulations . Video is not film ; it is tape ? and therefore it can be replayed immediately . Football , or life , can be reinvestigated a few seconds after it has happened . Video is not conventional TV , either , because it accepts the screen , the phosphor , as the medium , and goes from there . Video people play with the knobs and controls in ways that had n't been dreamed of back in the clays when a television exec 's idea of heaven was a realistic picture . Video is television with pride in itself . WGBH , Boston 's educational station , almost unknowingly presided over the birth of video . By allowing some of its staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early Sixties , the station inadvertently spawned a new art form , and dignified a new conception of television as a tool of everyone . At the center of this effort stands Fred Barzyk . In 1958 he came to WGBH as a graduate student at Boston University , working three days a week ; after a few years as a part-time director , he became fulltime in 1961 . He produced Parlous Francais , which won an Ohio State University award ; a show with psychiatrist Robert Coles on busing ( in 1956 I , which won an NET award ; and a show called All About You , an in-school teaching program on sex education . But in addition to such sober tasks he played around . And it was through play that the new emerged . Barzyk still looks like an ex-graduate student , a friendly genius . " In the late Fifties and early Sixties , " he recalls , " there was no such thing as video tape . It was all live . So there were vast amounts of time when no one at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " WGBI f , an educational station with a vengeance , prided itself on presenting the Boston Symphony Orchestra as the flagship of its cultural programs . Two hours of straight orchestra can he dull , though , and in the control room two schools of thought emerged about how Jonathan Price is coauthor , with PAR Lahr , of Lifeshow ( a book about theater and life ) , to be published by Viking in the fall . He is now marking on a book about video tape . to liven the image while reproducing the sound . " The purists wanted to zoom in on the trombone when it takes the A theme ? and then there were the romanticists , and we wanted to interpret the music . There was always that fight . " The purists won with the BSO . But on the many less sacred groups , like the Harvard Glee Club , the management generously left the producer-directors free to play . In fact , experimentation was encouraged . " As long as it made specifications , as long as it was good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In 1964 , after four or live years of seeing video tapes , Barzyk decided to plunge in himself ; he got three cameramen together in the basement , played some jazz , and encouraged them to tape new visuals to accompany the irregular flow of the notes . One man had just bought a kaleidoscope in Maine , and he put that in front of the camera . The simple toy made bright and pleasantly fuzzy patterns like stained glass windows in black and white ; the crystals moved together , then blinked out of one pattern into another , a quietly elegant continual metamorphosis . Five short tapes were made , called Jazz Images , and when Fred Barzyk took them upstairs to show management there was some amazement that nonrealistic pictures could he so interesting , then an agreement to invite more . " This was a tender step forward , " but the problem of enlivening longer time spans remained . Then in the summer of 1967 David Silvers , an Englishman who was teaching at Tufts , came to WGBH and did a number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Called What 's Happening , Mr. Silvers ? the half-hour show experimented with nonnarrative , nontalk barrage , as Barzyk and his collaborators tried to move more sparkle , more contrast , more exciting images onto the screen . Borrowing some ideas from jazz and from composer John Cage , Barzyk brought in thirty-odd video inputs , film clips , live action , purposely nonrelevant tapes , slides , newspapers , photographs , street interviews , and abstract video imagery , swirling a collage around some nominal topic , such as witches . warlocks , or William F. Buckley . Then Barzyk let four or five people into the control room at a time . Each was told to cut from one source to another whenever he felt like it . The result was a blitz of random personal visuals , all more or less on the same topic . The only consistent image was David Silvers ' face , which kept appearing somewhat quizzically ? a stand-in for the equally puzzled viewer . The familiar here seemed foreign , and therefore curious : Barzyk had found , in juxtaposition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Commercialmakers soon picked up the idea for their high tension ha If-minutes . " At that time , ton , we began talking to the engineers , " says Barzyk . Previously each job in the studio was isolated from the others . " I said , ' Everyone 's going to be in this show . ' On the regular networks you have a cameraman and that 's all he does . We took the lighting person , and put him behind the camera , and took the engineer and let him direct , and put the cameraman over on the controls . " Mixing previously segregated jobs , Barzyk found people got on better with each other -- and the show took on the quirks and interests , the imaginative bursts of each . A new melange , a spirit of group activity , emerged . Remember the midSixties ? Most stations thought experiment was Abbie Hoffman on a talk show , and the word abortion in the afternoon . Recall the fear and the good intentions of ten years ago , the nervous guarding of studio expenses as station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sake , broadcasting French farce in the afternoon , newspapers in the evening , old movies and conversation . Even today a network special generally aspires to be an essay by Charles Iamb , carrying with it that peculiar feeling of heaviness , the pious feeling that we should watch . The very real boredom is the result in part of trying to make television , a visual medium , follow patterns worked out by wordsmiths . The makers will tell you the interesting things they found out about the subject , but they will ritually tuck them into their proper position in an English II essay , surrounding the apeNus with a slow pro and con , balancing out all their own impressions in a bland presentation of the problem and its possible solutions with a sober judgment in the end that there is indeed a problem , and we all hope it will be solved . A faster rate of apercus , more satori per square inch , realization thirty times a second : that becomes the dream when one suddenly sees that television is in fact a medium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In its own way video offers a canvas , unique colors , buttons to build , manipulate , and distort ? miraculous images . he first general exposure of the work being done at WGBH came in 1969 with the national broadcast of The Medium is the Medium . a show prepared by the station under a Public Broadcasting Lab grant . Nam June Paik , an avantgarde artist born in Korea , brought twelve of his " doctored " television sets into the WGBH studios , focused three color cameras on them , added two nude dancers , then showed the same image in multiples , one in green ? live ? and a second in blue . There was an eerie pause , as the picture reappeared in duplicate ? a follow-up on tape delay ? reversing the images at times from positive to negative , then warping the shape of the dancers into flashing bursts . In the background the " Moonlight Sonata ' . accompanied the images through their meta-morphoses The quality of color is like a day-glo silk screen : the details wash out in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nicker as the faces , or the legs , dissolve into waves in front of themselves . It is like watching seals in the night sea , leaving trails of phosphorescence . Watching gives primiti , pleasure : not highly verbs not full of charts or statistics , not even the details 0 : yesterday 's breakfast ; Paik 's video is more abstract . It parallels internal processes of thought ; it is riot verbally thought through , but it seems to mimic the process our brain goes through as we reach for some word , say , to express ourselves . We move through the material , seeing , losing that glimpse , trying always to reestablish vision . But the machines change it too fast for us : we are always led or The music provides a nineteenth-century ship on which we can sail . For the same production , Allan Kaprow , one of the many fathers of happenings , experimented with the instantaneity of video . Using an elaborate closed circuit , he sent groups of people out to locations throughout Boston and Cambridge with instrueions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " to each other whenwer they saw another face m the monitor . Kaprow let me person talk for a few noments , then switched to omeone else ; one person 's mage might be appearing ? n any or all of the twentyeven monitors spread round town , and might in ddition be appearing on he tape selected as on-air. : aprow provided a score , len , not a complete script ? the faces , moods , and Words of the individual eople themselves provided le image ; the art , as usual , : y in his shaping , not in le particular voices . It was if he had blended tosther all these people into re giant New Yorkish teletone hookup . His idea , s wiring , paralleled the ay we get together in thisdistance-jumping culture , and its moral if any was to say hello more . The only information , as he said himself , was " Oneself in connection with someone else . " Otto Piene 's Electronic Light Ballet , Spartan in comparison , used only two sources . Barzyk says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lights behind , and he found out that if you put a hot light behind , and manipulate the light , you get these spermlike circles . " They float across the screen , then spin hot tails . The other image source was film of Piene 's own Manned Helium Sculpture . eight hundred feet of polyethylene tubing , a gangling misshapen balloon gaseously lifting a slender girl into the air over MIT . The girl rose , then the dots swept across , then he homed in on the swirls , then floated back to the balloon itself . The effect is like a ritual : unearthly , but perfectly familiar thanks to the years of surrealism and abstraction we already have behind us in the fine arts and the years of space shots on TV . We see a real image , then such rapid transformation of it ? by overlay ; by color change ; by distortion into webs , rolls . Lissajous figures , and multiples ? that we pursue the original image as far as we can , paying more attention to it than we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realistic picture of a girl in a helmet is still primarily a girl in a helmet ; video 's transformations suggest that she is also a baby in the sac , a soul in hell tormented by demons , a white blob , again an astronaut . This is a medium familiar to all of us now that we have watched color sets go wrong ; when you control your set , you are involved in transforming images . Very simple images seem to be the preference now , so that the complexities of the changes become apparent Nam June Paik favors putting the viewer in the chair and feeding his image back to him . Through the work Paik has done at WGBH and elsewhere , he has created a video synthesizer to mix four or five camera sources at once , in color , emerging with a visual flow that is as unpredictable as oil on a pond in a light breeze . The video synthesizer is the first product of the new video sensibility , and it will probably be a springboard to a second generation of video @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ varieties of control available . Paik used the synthesizer to broadcast live visuals accompanying four hours of the Beatles in August 1970 , a program so popular WGBH offered it again this year as a thankyou present to its viewers . Sexy and fluid , the video synthesizer spreads an inviting image on the screen . I sit down in a plasticchair , next to a 100-watt bulb , and Paik adjusts the zoom lens on his simple Sony camera . " All cheap , " he says . Then the edge of my glasses strikes sparks on screen , and I see a yellow trail behind the glare as I breathe . My head fills up the screen ; hearing another tape in the background , Janis Joplin 's last concert , I let myself move , and my hair splashes across the image of my head , an obscure wave . Underneath the table he has an oscilloscope , and when he flips that on , figure eights loop across me , suggesting infinity and irradiation ; the colors flare up into safety pinks , then , with another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lights in blue , eerie as infrared at night . Paik puts in a flashing circle that sets a new pace . Behind my own image , over it , under it , there are continuing movements of electrons , almost like themes in music intermixing . Rock groups will be making tapes with the synthesizer by next year , to be played on the monitors that twenty major firms intend to sell with the same verve they sold color TV . Of ninety million TV sets , thirty million are already color , and some experts dream that by 1977 half of us may have the simple monitor needed to play tapes from the store ? old movies , home instruction , pornography , and art . The prediction is uncertain , but the possibility is strong , as one can see in Frank Zappa 's video epic , 200 Motels . With the video synthesizer , rock can come with its own visuals ; what Sergeant Pepper was to rock , Paik 's WGBH Beatle show was to video . asicaily , the revolution of video has been to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sacred preserve of the experts . People with no previous TV experience have been allowed to flip the knobs , upping contrast , zooming , washing the screen . It takes about five minutes to learn : the shifts are so immediately visible that the mind joins the fingers very quickly , and making video tape is for most people simply a matter of asking a few questions , then plunging in . In fact , it is harder to tune most home sets than to snake good video tape . Fred Barzyk says , " I 'm only the midwife . " But he and WGBH have helped show the world that TV can be more than Walter Cronkite 's face . That news comes from KQ VD in San Francisco as well . Brice Iloward , who in 1967 organized the National Center for Experiments in Television at KQED , says , " It 's not technology , it is attitude shift that is making this happen . " The process is one of interaction , and since there are two human beings involved , at a minimum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as on their contrasts . Not knowing quite what would happen , Howard invited a spectrum of artists to make tapes at the experiment center at KQED . In one sequence Joanne Kyger talks a poem about Descartes , a little like Allen Ginsberg without drugs , and her image bellies into four , then the focus returns to her hands as she continues to talk about space , time , life , and geometry . Composer Richard Feliciano collaborated with videographer Stephen Beck in January 1971 on Point of Inflection , a highly geometric work in which diamonds re-form as squares , and periodic waves interrupt the screen , dazzling us with curves before square waves come down enveloping the red diamonds with repeated washes , counterpointing the somewhat Japanese sound composition . By elirn inating any live images , any photographic realism , by limiting themselves to diamonds and their narrow range of transformations , Beck and Feliciano merge in an austere mechanical music of their own . Defying metaphor , refusing story line , emphasizing the very physics of their synthesis , they achieve a thinness that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end they return with an electronic engineer 's fascination to the original diamond shape , an image of their work . The question remains , how well can such techniques be put into general use ? Russ Connor , now al the New York State Council on the Arts , in bec , an as a 9 painter . " I cling to that identity , " he says . In 1963 he came to WGBH to produce a weekly show called Museum Open House on the Boston Museum of Fine Arts . He surveyed the museum 's collections , but he also did a couple of experiments in video , arguing on the show that " this medium of television itself has a potential as an art medium . " At that time such experiments were called surrealist , but video has grown in affluence since then , and Russ Connor is now in charge of granting money through the New York State Council to independent video artists and , equally important , to local stations all over the state . Without charity . of course , video would still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can already see several programs suggestive of the future , when TV execs get the cricks out of their necks . Nonverbal , nonnarrative , these programs are adult and open Sesame Streets . Richard Hauser has inherited the Roston Museum of Fine Arts from Connor , carrying it much farther into the Barzyk-like collage ? to the point where curators tremble , since the verbal text is not the same as arthistory journals , and the play is delightful . The series is now called Eye to Eye , and one show on monuments opens with a man walking in the rain in the Boston Gardens . No gallery talks here . The man comes to a statue , and we hear him say , " Jesus Christ , is it wet ! " Then the face turns and we see Claes Oldenburg . No burst of biography follows . though . The scene cuts to another monument . A cameraman explores a huge abandoned warehouse . while the voice behind talks of the Eiffel Tower ? juxtaposition and thought shout our needs for scale and reverence that monumental sculptures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more snippets , with his Colossal Lipstick and his sketches of impossible monuments . By the end of the program , all the segments flow together . Of course , if you expect Art News you will be impatient , moment to moment , for " hard information , " dates , verbal arrays . But WGBH knows TV does not communicate the same kind of information print does , and Eye to Eye make none of those network pretenses : Eye iv Eye is an impressionistic tour , and it opens up monuments from a thousand angles , jerking us forward through one perception to another , having faith that in the end our own brains will recombine the elements , is their own ways , to make some sense . The risk is drivel , but the promise is exposure to a special sensi bility . Video depends , like any medium , on the qualil of the people . Moving beyond conven tiona I television to metaphor , attaining depth through the methods of poesis , these works make sue think of Ezra Pound 's maxim : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To condense is poetry . " For Nine Heroes , an awai winning show exploring nine of the ordinary pecqwho have saved lives i frr among the five thousand cases documented by the Carnegie Commission Hero Fund , Hauser began to explore the cases and found each a complex story capable of two hours of conventional TV . Upon reflection he chose to condense each story into central metaphors . In one , a horse rides by on a beach , and a woman who is eighty-four now and has lost three men husband , father , and son ? in heroic acts , looks at the horse , perhaps remembering the runaway horse that killed her husband , perhaps looking at the beach . She is sitting in oversaturated color , and she turns to the camera , perfectly herself , and says : " You think it 's all going to come back , and it do n't . " People are at the center : their image and . with the person manipulating the colorful mirage. their interaction , delicately revealed second to second . Mike Rice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the satisfaction most people find when they pick up one of the cameras and start shooting , or playing with the knobs.watching the effects on the monitor . Y ou get your hands on the equipment . and you get instant response . Video has such a clean straightforward way of making an image that it 's got wide response . " Until now , most television people have treated the common public with great mistrust , filtering them through auditions , then through moderators , and then , as a final safeguard . through a tape-delay for blips , before allowing diem to appear on the air . WGBH recognized that the main fear comes from the FCC licensing rules , and that these boil down to fairly simple standards that most groups would not violate anyway if given a chance to go on the air : ? Do n't attack identified private persons . ? Do n't use airtime Lu incite violence . ? Do n't use language or gestures that people would consider obscene , indecent , or profane . ? I ) o n't use the airtime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ station decided to set up a regular time free for any local group that wanted to tape a half-hour show of their views , showing whatever they wanted . How to get-past the rules ? The title was Catch 44 , and the catch is this : if you agree to the four rules , you 're on the air . If you violate them on the air , WGBH will just cut you off . So far two hundred and fifty groups have made their own half-hour shows , and none has been cut off the air . The Young Americans for Freedom . enraged by what they considered " liberal " interview shows , staged their ( ) WTI hurlesque . They were using one channel to lambaste what they considered the consistent bias of talk and news shows , which they felt asked embarrassing questions of their favorite people . Trust responds to trust , somehow , and at WGBH all the people get on . Few of these programs are going to win awards as video art , but that suggests part of their joy : they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Young Republicans ; prisoners from Billerica ; Hysteria ( a Women 's I : lb paper ) ; Music of Portugal ; the Irish Republican Aid Committee ; the Royal Scottish Country Dance Society ; and the Great Boston Kite Festival . Catch 44 , on UH I ' , gives each group its half hour . The rewards in gratitude , all around , are intangible . So far WGBH is the only station in the country to let the public on the air directly and regularly with the same respect accorded professionals and artists . like Rice was talking of artists , but what he says applies to any one of us : " Video is for anyone who is concerned not just with expressing himself but also with reaching the greatest number of people . We are very program-oriented here . If something beautiful is done , we 're not content to have two or three people see it , or five hundred , or a thousand . We want millions . " Here lies television 's electricity for all of us . " In America . unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your voice is stilled . " The dream of video : that eventually each of us may communicate via television with the rest of the citizens of this country , an . then the world . And as cable opens up twelve , then twenty-five extra channels , all needing tapes , the individual voices of the people may appear around the dat using the equipment the major corporations intend to sell retail like color TV sets . By the end of next yen almost anyone will be able to make tapes of broadcast quality for less cost than half a Volkswagen , with less training than it takes t make a blender shred carrots . V iden is mechanical , but for anyone raised on TV it is as familiar as Instant Breakfast . That is the vision of what is possible : a quantum jump in information flow among u as electronic citizens ? a universal-access Today show . By putting its faith in tl people , by relying for its funds entirely on the done dons of some fifty thousai givers over the years , WGBH has led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new conceptii of television ; along the way , the station 's affluenc has grown , and its importance is such that drama students just out of schoo go to work in the mailroo : just to be in the vicinity . Perhaps that old robber baron Andrew Carnegie was right when he advocated going " the extra mile , " and perhaps Napo leon Hill . the man who documented Carnegie 's own theory of how to trai yourself to wealth , was ri too when he summed up t curmudgeon 's slogan : " Wealth that is shared creates inure wealth , and you can share many fora of wealth besides money .
