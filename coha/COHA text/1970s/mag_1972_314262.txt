CANDIDATES for the Senate do not come any younger than Joseph R. Biden Jr. , 29 , the Wilmington trial lawyer who is running a close race against Delaware Republican Senator Caleb Boggs . If he wins , he will become the youngest Senator ever popularly elected and seated with the new Congress . Under the strict interpretation of the Constitution* a Senator must be 30 , and Biden would qualify with 44 days to spare . <P> He would , in all likelihood , also be one of the few Senators ever to jump motorcycles as a hobby . A college football and rugby enthusiast , Biden keeps his athletic trim by skiing and playing an extremely rough brand of touch football . That kind of exuberant roughhousing , coupled with his star-quality good looks , seems to cast Biden , an Irish Catholic , in the Kennedy mold . The Kennedy comparison is encouraged by the intense involvement of his family in the current campaign : Joe 's sister is his campaign manager , his brother is his fund-raising director , his mother is his state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty blonde , keeps her own energetic speaking schedule . <P> In 1970 , Biden ran for the New Castle County Council ( which includes Wilmington ) and won by a large margin despite the fact that the district was 65% Republican . That feat won him an appointment to a commission charged with rejuvenating the Democratic state party . Biden so charmed the local politicians that they pressed him to run against Republican Governor Russell Peterson in this fall 's election . Although Democratic polls showed him ahead of Peterson , Biden held out for the more difficult Senate contest . <P> So far , he has run a clean , energetic and relatively inexpensive campaign ( $90,000 ) . Biden is against the war and highway " overconstruction " and favors strong ecology measures , but opposes the legalization of marijuana . He has attacked Boggs as an ineffective ward politician . <P> Far from belittling Biden as an insignificant upstart , the opposition seems to hold him in awe , even though Boggs is running ahead . Boggs ' campaign staffers charge that Biden is ambitious and wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His more ardent supporters agree . They are already touting Biden as a presidential possibility . He would qualify for the 1976 presidential race-by 61 days . <P> <P> * That article of the Constitution has been stretched a bit three separate times . When they took office , Henry Clay and Armistead Mason were 29 , and John Eaton was 28 . Rush Dew Holt was too young by more than five months and was made to wait until he turned 30 in 1935.
