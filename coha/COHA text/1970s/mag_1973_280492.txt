Japan 's Konosuke Matsushita , a peasant 's son , built one of the world 's largest companies by following his instincts . One of the shrewdest hunches came in 1940 , when an aristocratic young banker caught Matsushita 's eye . The gregarious businessman was so impressed with Masaharu Hirata that he not only arranged for him to marry his only daughter but also adopted him as a son . <P> The new Matsushita joined the family firm , Matsushita Electric Industrial Company , and began studying shacho-gaku ( the art of presidency ) . Now the elder Matsushita , 78 , is stepping down after 55 years as chief executive . His position as chairman will be filled by Arataro Takahashi , 70 , but the power will be swung by Masaharu Matsushita , who will continue as president . <P> The shift promises to change the personality of the company . The elder Matsushita , an outspoken man who enjoys traditional tea ceremonies , ran the company ( sales last year : $3.9 billion ) as a one-man show .

Says he : " I do n't think top executives should allow themselves to be involved in the process of decision making for day-today operations . We have to think in a global context .
