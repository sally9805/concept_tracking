txt Prince Mohammed Al-Faisal , who is in charge of this country 's huge program to boost its freshwater supply through defiannicarion , speaks perfect English , has a number of friends in the United States and , from all reports , has a high opinion of American products and American technology . Why then , one well might ask , is n't American industry participating in the prince 's desalinization venture ? Prince Mohammed Al-Faisal is asking the same question . For despite his best efforts , including written invitations to several American firms , he has been unable to induce any companies in the U.S. to bid on the millions of dollars of contracts involved in the project . The result : disappointment for the prince and a potential bonanza for firms in other countries . ( According to the prince , companies in France and Japan have eagerly sought contracts . ) This state of affairs might be considered merely curious if it were n't part of a pattern . Indeed , here in this dusty , booming port where the desert meets the Red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggest that Americans , through a combination of ineptitude and indifference , are losing considerable business both here and in neighboring Mideast countries that is theirs for the asking . And while some American businessmen call the Saudi Arabian market small , American trade officials say it will , grow 30% to 40% a year for several years from a level already over $2 billion in 1973 . Serious Consequences ? The consequences that could result from these muffed business chances , observers believe , could be serious for the Americans . First of all , it will be increasingly difficult to contain , much less close , the widening payments gap between the U.S. and Arab oil nations as America imports increasing amounts of Arab oil at higher prices . But the diplomatic ramifications could also be damaging for the U.S. For while American firms perhaps regard trade in this area as relatively insignificant , American diplomats are galled by the fact that the U.S. could be  --  but is n't  --  flooding the area with highly visible products such as autos , industrial equipment and consumer goods . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American economic presence here , they believe , is one of the best ways to secure access to vital oil supplies and to stave off Soviet penetration . " Business and government are intertwined here , " one American official says . " A minister who decides on big contracts may have a brother who imports cars . If his brother is complaining about long delivery times and lack of spare parts for American autos , he may think twice about whether he 's really so eager to have Americans handling a big government job . " Behind the Figures It is true that American firma are in line for some big industrial contracts here , including a refinery , a steel mill and an autoassembly plant , all of which have been approved in principle . And a quick glance at trade figures might suggest that things are n't going too badly . The statistics show American exports to Saudi Arabia up 36% , to $442 million last year , boosting their market share to over 27% of Saudi Arabian imports . " Statistically you are doing very well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign ministry official tells an American . " Maybe your companies are too busy elsewhere . Maybe they rely too much on their Beirut offices and do n't come here enough . " Still less impressed with the figures is Wahib S. Binzagr , a traditionally gowned Saudi businessman who deals with several American exporters through his Binzagr group of trading , service and industrial companies . " There are lies , damned lies and statistics , " says Mr. Binzagr , borrowing a phrase generally attributed to Benjamin Disraeli . He points out  --  and U.S. trade officials confirm  --  that the bulk of American gains here has been in military and other government-togovernment sales and , in sales to Aramco , the big Saudi-American oil consortium that produces most of Saudi Arabia 's oil . Mr. Binsagr Is Unimpressed Trade is in Mr. Binzagr 's blood : He directs his businesses from a pine-paneled , airconditioned office over the Souk , Jidda 's ancient , sprawling waterfront market of tiny shops and stalls selling wares ranging from sandals and ancient breech-loading rifles to expensive hi-fi equipment . And he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American companies are efficient in making first-class products , but they are useless when it comes to backing up their exports , " he asserts . As an example of his assertion , Mr. Binzagr cites his experience with CPC Internee tional Inc. , from which he imports corn oil . CPC recently left him unsupplied for nine months on account of shortages , he says , and it then insisted on changing to plastic containers despite his pleas to continue shipping in gallon tins . As a result , he says , shipment of 8,000 cases arrived totally damaged , " To them it 's just an insurance claim ; to us it 's a whole market for their product . " CPC explains that when shortages developed last year , It suspended all corn-oil ? X. : porta in order to keep up supplies to the domestia U.S. market , But that sort of attitude to foreign markets only , galls the Saudis even more , " Can you imagine a Japanese company doing that ? " Mr. Binsagr asks . They ignore our orders and send Is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the Chrysler distributor well as the automotive purchasing ? the national guard . Mr. Alesayi red about 2,700 Chrysler cars this says . and should have received at by now . But so far , he adds , only made it to Jidda , and another dad up In Dubai and Kuwait by ire . Mr. Alesayi says Chrysler is sending a representative to see that the errant autos get to Dammam on the Persian Gulf , where he will have to collect them . Meanwhile , he has stationed his own representative in Detroit to see that the next batch gets shipped properly . He does n't blame the company for all these problems , he emphasizes , adding that his relations with Chrysler remain good . But both he and Chrysler are losing business , he laments . Both GM and Chrysler say that they try hard to service the Saudi market but that shipping schedules have been disrupted by the fuel crisis . This is doubtless true , but the Americans ' loss of the auto market , which they once led here , predates the fuel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here in 1966 . By 1972 , however , U.S. vehicle sales here had dropped to fifth place , or 13,200 , while the Japanese led the field with 53,600 vehicles . And that was in a year in which total Saudi imports of cars and trucks more than doubled . Of course , to auto companies dealing with a home market of nine million cars a year , the Arab market hi tiny . " Yes , the vol. tune potential in Saudi Arabia has jumped appreciably recently , but it 's still a small market , " says a Chrysler International official in London . " They may have a bell of a lot of y , but the size of the market does n't make It worth catering specially to Therefore , while the Japanese have gone out of their way to make special adaptatkass requested by the Saud* American concerns are reluctant to spend the money to meet specialized Saudi requirements . For example , Austin Taaffe , Middle East sales representative of General Mills Inc. , doubts that his company can respond to a Saudi request @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of begs of flour and container loads of corn flakes he sells here are important to him , he says , " but are peanuts to the company . They just could n't afford to stop a production run for special labeling . " " Fabulous Treaaure " Far from peanuts , however , are the big equipment and construction contracts toward which American companies  --  at least in Saudi eyes  --  seem to display an equally blase attitude . " There is a fabulous treasure here called oil . There are going to be work and business here for the next hundred years , " says Tame ! Dajani , administrative director of Saudi Research and Development Corp. , a Saudi contracting and investment company . " There are thousands of miles of roads to be built here , but I do n't see any American companies around except for military contracts . They are slow to react . " No Americans bid , for example , on the $50 million contract to expand the port of Jidda  --  to the disappointment of All Saleh Melanie , the 39-year old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Ohio State ) . Mr. Melaka says he would also have liked to be using Caterpillar and Byeter , forklift trucks in the port but that spareparts supplies were erratic . " The Americans did n't support their agents here so we had to go elsewhere , " he says . In fact , he relates , a Japanese company , Komatsu , moved is. backed its Saudi agent with adminberative and technical . ! capon ! , and won the contract to supply over 100 *sliding to the port . " Once you have a contract like that , you hare the amide track . " says Mr. Malinke . ( Caterpillar says Its too busy ngplying the European market to sell forklifts in Saudi Arabia . Hyster insists it does support its Saudi agent but loft the Jidda port forklift order strictly on price considerations . ) The Grand MaIlltalf The Americans also lost the $300 million contract to build the new airport here although the Saudi Civil Aviation Agency bad gone out of its way to solicit American bids , according to a consultant for Airways Engineering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the job . The Saudis had asked 12 American firms to bid and had hoped to come up with a final list of six American and six other firms to choose from , says one of Airways ' engineers here . But only one American company placed a bid , the engineers say , and only on a costyam basis , which was n't responsive to the Saudi request for a fixed-price contract . The American bid was thrown out . Hochtie , a German contractor , got the job . " Some of these big American companies tend to act in the grand manner about what they can do for the little country . It can tend to put some countries off , " the Airways man says . Eventually patience with such American business attitudes and practices runs out here , even among the most loyal American customers themselves .
