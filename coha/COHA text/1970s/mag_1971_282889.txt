During his last presidential campaign , Richard Nixon denounced " the wave of crime " that he said was sweeping the country . What was needed , he said , was " leadership that will place this problem as the first priority of American business . " The Republican nominee characterized Attorney General Ramsey Clark as " soft on crime " and a " coddler of criminals . " A new man at the Department of Justice , Nixon proclaimed , was needed " if we are to restore order and respect for law in this country . " Republicans everywhere blamed the permissiveness of Democratic Administrations for rising crime rates . <P> That was 1968 . Now , three years later , Nixon 's unblushing rhetoric may well be returning to haunt him . Under his Administration , crime has continued to mount . In 1969 the total of reported crimes increased 12% over the previous year , while the four categories of violent crime-murder , rape , robbery , assault-jumped 11% . In 1970 total crime rose another 11% ; violent crime increased 12% . Clark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the FBI statistics for the first half of this year . The figures were no more encouraging : total crime up 7% compared to the same period last year , violent crime up 11% . <P> With some rather dubious statistical footwork , Mitchell sidestepped the most obvious conclusion to be drawn from the report-that performance has not matched promise . " The continuing upward trend illustrates that crime is still one of our foremost problems , " he admitted , " but the decelerating rate of increase provides a basis for cautious optimism . " Although crime increased 7% from January through June this year , said Mitchell , that was 4% less than 1970 's increase over the year before . In other words , things are getting worse more slowly . <P> Deceptive Gains . The Attorney General pointed out that 50 cities with populations of more than 100,000 reported reductions in the amount of violent crime ; last year 34 such cities reported reductions . What is more , Washington , D.C. , " the only city over which the Federal Government has jurisdiction , " as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the first half of 1971 . Trouble is , the gains Mitchell reported are like a set of cooked corporate books-deceptive . <P> A more balanced assessment of crime trends would have to take into account some less agreeable FBI statistics . They report , among other things , a 17% increase in violent crimes in the suburbs during the first six months of this year . They also indicate what Mitchell did not say , that most of the nation 's largest cities showed increases in at least one of the four categories of violent crime ; two of the cities-New York and Philadelphia-registered increases across the board . Washington , which Mitchell singled out for special praise , had more murders and rapes during the first half of the year than in the same period of 1970 , while robberies and assaults declined only slightly . What principally accounted for crime reduction in the District of Columbia were substantial decreases in property crimes : burglary , larceny and auto theft .                  @ @ @
