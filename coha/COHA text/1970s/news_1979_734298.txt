txt WASHINGTON  --  The House soundly defeated Tuesday a proposed constitutional amendment that would ban busing as a way of integrating the public schools . The amendment , which has been introduced regularly for the last decade , is now dead for this session of Congress , and perhaps for good . The vote was 209 for the amendment and 216 against , a surprising victory for civil rights forces who thought the proposal would command a majority in the House . As a constitutional amendment , the proposal required a two-thirds vote for passage . The voting patterns Tuesday reflected the changing nature of race relations in this country . The spotlight of racial tension is now focused on the North , not the South , and while several drawling Southern voices opposed the amendment in the House Tuesday , the distinctive accents of Boston and the Middle West often rose in support of the resolution . THE KEY ARGUMENT Tuesday was voiced by congressmen who said that while they opposed the use of busing. they also opposed the use of a constitutional amendment to correct the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for our children as our predecessors left it for us , " said Rep. Peter Rodin . D. , N.J. , chairman of the House Judiciary Committee , in his final argument against the proposal . Democrats  --  joined by some Republicans  --  cheered as the clock on the eletronic vote counter reached zero and indicated the issue was decided . Spectators packed the galleries during more than four hours of debate and voting on parliamentary maneuvers . The speaker admonished the crowd twice against cheering after floor speeches . RODINO RECEIVED scattered applause , mainly from Democrats , when he read a letter from President Carter urging the lawmakers to reject the proposed amendment . " The 25th anniversary of the Supreme Court 's decision in Brown vs . Board of Education is a time to renew our commitment to this fundamental goal  --  not a time to retreat , " Carter 's letter said . The Democrats gave a standing ovation , however , to Rep. John Anderson R. , Rockford when he attacked the proposed amendment as a threat to the Constitution 's guarantee of equal protection under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ document to deal with this issue in this manner , " said Anderson , a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination . REP . ROBERT McClory R , Lake Bluff , who joined Anderson in criticizing the proposal , said GOP support of the amendment would set back the party 's recent gains among blacks . Rep. Ronald Mottl D. , Ohio , sponsor of the House amendment , called on his fellow lawmakers to oppose " judicial terrorism " by taking a stand against court-ordered busing . " The sentiment in this country is to bring court-ordered busing for racial balance in the schools to an immediate halt , " he said . Mottl won an initial victory June 27 when he gained the majority of signs // Defeated by 216-209 vote House kills U.S. busing ban amendment // tures needed to force anti-busing amendment to the House floor for the first time in history . BUT SOME OF the 218 House members who signed his petition apparently had second thoughts Tuesday about amending the Constitution over the busing issue . The proposed amendment said " no student shall be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national origin , to attend a public school other than the public school nearest to the residence of such student . " In the roll call vote , 95 Democrats and 114 Republicans voted yes , while 176 Democrats and 40 Republicans voted no . A yes vote was in favor of the amendment .
