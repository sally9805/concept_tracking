THE Manned Spacecraft Center , ln Houston , was a good deal qui- eter after the recent Apollo 12 flight than after Apollo 1. i last July . There were fewer reporters , so the museum in Building No. 1 , the Public Affairs Building , did n't have to he moved into tents outdoors to make room for television equipment , as it had to be in July . There were also fewer tourists , and some of them had the leisure to look at an art exhibition , " The NASA Collection , " which hangs in a mezzanine overlooking the museum 's display of rockets and spacecraft . " A number of contemporary American artists have been asked by NASA to record the peaceful exploration of space , " a sign describing the art show said . " Unlike the explorers of the 17th century , the magazine editors of the Civil War , and the official historians of both world wars , NASA has the significant advantage of being able to pinpoint when and where history will be made . " The NASA view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an orange tower under a blue sky ; an oil painting of a missile rising into the air , gushing orange flames , while a group of soldiers watch in awe ; and an oil of some astronauts stepping out of a helicopter onto a red mat spread on the deck of an aircraft carrier . The flight of Apollo 12 went well from lift-off to splashdown . The people who work at the Space Center were more relaxed than before , . too . After the flight , I ran into David Reed , the Flight Dynamics Officer , who was in charge of the trajectory of the lunar module during its landing on the moon . " Well , we did it ! " Reed said cheerfully . " We said we 'd do it , and we really did ! " What he had done was to set the LM down within six hundred feet of Surveyor III , the unmanned spacecraft that landed on the Oceanus Procellarum almost three years ago . In fact , Reed and the other flight engineers had been too accurate in plotting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conrad , Jr. , who was at the controls , had to change the LM 's landing point at the last minute . " He was afraid he 'd land right on top of the Surveyor if he kept on going according to plan , and later , when we fed the data from the LM into a computer , we found that if he 'd gone on in the way he was , he would have hit it , " Reed told me . As for the geologists , Dr. William Greenwood , a wiry young man from Idaho who was in charge of opening one of the two boxes of rocks the astronauts brought hack , said , " Last time , there was a real animal excitement about opening the boxes . This time , the excitement was more scientific , because we had a pretty good notion of what to expect , and so me of us had ideas we wanted to test out . " Dr. Daniel H. Anderson , the curator of the Lunar Receiving Laboratory , who was in charge of opening the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as many newsmen around , which means there is less pressure on us , and that is kind of nice . We can be excited without being tense . Maybe we can get some work done . " There was so little tension , in Fact , that when Dr. Anderson and a technician got to work on their rock box they spent the afternoon washing the box and unlatching its straps , and went out to dinner before bothering to look inside . After dinner , the technician threw back the lid , and Dr. Anderson saw a shiny aluminum core tube and two milky-white Teflon bags . " I could see a small tear in one of the bags , so I asked the technician to rip it open , " Dr. Anderson told me later . " I could immediately see two very large rocks . I wanted to get one of them for the radioactive counting laboratory right away  --  before its isotopes decayed further  --  hut as we pulled it out of the bag it got bigger and bigger , like an iceberg . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laboratory had designed to hold any rocks to be examined . %Ye pulled out two more rocks , and they were both too big . The fourth rock  --  from the smaller hag  --  was a beautiful rock , just the right size , and under the dust on it I could see crystals sparkling . " The larger of the two Teflon hags contained the three large gray rocks the size of cobbles and several kilograms of fine particles , which were a dust ) charcoal gray . The second hag contained seventeen rocks , all smaller than those in the first hatch . One of the rocks from the second hag was coated with a substance like glass . Commander Conrad had described by radio , when he was on the moon , a good-sized glass sphere , like a big marble . " Every time I sec Captain Conrad he says , ' Have you found my glass marble yet ? ' So far , it has n't turned up , " Dr. Anderson said , Outside the Receiving Laboratory , two flags drooped from a pole : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ redwhite-and-blue banner  --  an international biohazard flag . Even though no germs were found in the samples brought hack by the Apollo 11 crew last Jidy , the quarantine precautions will probably continue through the return of the Apollo 13 crew , next March . The morning I arrived at the Space Center , I spotted a headline in the Houston Post which read , " GLOVE TEAm AT MOON DUST TAR PUTS 11 MEN IN QUARANTINE . " Three of the eleven were men I had come to see  --  Dr. Clifford Frondel , the senior member of the Preliminary Examination Team , or PET , : end Dr. Robin Brett and Dr. Edward Chao , two other members of the team . I telephoned Dr. Brett , in the quarantine quarters , to ask him what had happened . He said that he and nine other men had been standing in a laboratory where an assistant was working with a pair of rubber gloves set into a glass cabinet that had contained moon dust . The assistant , noticing- what looked like a bole in one of the gloves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the damaged glove , thus squirting air from inside the cabinet out into the room . The most exasperating part of it , Dr. Brett said , was that there was reason to believe that the glove had n't been penetrated all the way through until the technician had pulled it out . Dr. Brett was gloomy . " It 's a terrible feeling , being incarcerated just as you 're beginning to look at the moon rocks , " he said . " I could n't believe it was happening to me . " A couple of days later , Dr. Brett was beginning to find life in quarantine somewhat better than he had thought it might he . Microscopes and moon rocks were sent into the quarantine quarters , and the . scientists there ( six of them in all ) dumped the rocks on tables . They did n't examine them with their hare hands , but they were able to use their rock-handling tools without being encumbered by rubber gloves . Dr. Brett and the others chatted about the moon with the astronauts and had dinner with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them than any scientist did of the Apollo 11 astronauts . Dr. Anderson , who remained outside the quarantine quarters , came to envy the geologists on the inside , and he now wonders whether a few geologists should n't he locked up with all astronauts returning from the moon . Dr. Brett , however , does n't want to be quarantined more than once . One reason is that while he was in the . quarantine quarters he received some get-well cards , one of which read , " We hope you recover soon from whatever it is you 've got . " BEFORE I went down to Houston , Thomas Gold , an astrophysicist I met last summer at the Space Center , had invited me to join him at an A.B.C . studio in New York at 5:30 one morning  --  ahout half an hour before the first lunar walk of the Apollo 12 mission was scheduled to begin . The studio , a black , cavernous loft on West Sixty-sixth Street , was a much more moonlike place than the Space Center , for at one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LM perched on it , in one corner was a miniature moonscape with tiny silver-foil copies of the scientific instruments the astronauts were to set up on the moon ; and against one wall was the moon itself  --  a rotating globe about six feet in diameter , above which , hanging by a wire , an LM surveyed its craters . Cameras spotted about the room could zoom in on any of the sets . As walked in , I passed a full-size , cross-section model of an LM , with a man dressed in a space suit sleeping inside . There were a couple of dozen men in the studio , and most of them had been up all night . Mr. Gold , who was sitting at a rickety table watching a portable television set , said he had been there since two-thirty that morning . He was to comment from time to time no the astronauts ' activities . A determined-looking man in his late forties , he is a professor of astronomy at Cornell University and the director of its Center for Radiophysics and Space Research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge radio telescope that Cornell has situated at Arecibo , Puerto Rico , where a great deal of work on quasars and pulsars has been done . Being an astrophysicist , Mr. Gold regards the moon as something of a sideline . He considers the pulsars  --  tiny stars so dense that one cubic centimetre of their matter would weigh a billion tons -- one of the greater success stories in science , because a good deal of major work has been done on them in the two years since their discovery . " The pulsar study was n't at all like the moon , which we 've known about for eons , and the study of which is still unresolved , " Mr. Gold said . He is the originator of a theor that the moon is covered with a blanket of dust so fine that its particles can be carried  --  imperceptibly slowly  --  along an electrostatic current . He was hoping that the Apollo 12 astronauts would bring hack evidence supporting this idea . Mr. Gold was the Principal Investigator , or scientist in charge , for one piece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking extreme closeups of the moon 's surface . It was a silvery box with a long handle outside and a strobe light inside ; to use it , the astronauts merely pressed it against the ground and pulled a trigger . Mr. Gold complained that during the Apollo 11 mission Neil Armstrong had tended to use the camera as a walking stick . Armstrong took seventeen pictures , and these turned out so well that Armstrong said later that it was n't until lie had got hack to the Space Center and seen Mr. Gold 's pictures that he had any idea what the glassy material he saw I in the moon was like . Mr. Gold had high hopes for the Apollo 12 photographs . Before the astronauts stepped out into the moon , lie telephoned Houston to speak with Frederick Pierce , the co-investigator in the Lunar Surface Closeup Photography project , who was in the Science Staff Support Room at the Mission Control Center . Mr. Gold learned from him that the astronauts were scheduled to unload the camera from the LM after they had been out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he gave Mr. Pierce his telephone number at A.B.C . in case the astronauts had any questions . When Commander Conrad stepped onto the moon , Mr. Gold sat forward to get a better look at the television picture , and he broke into a smile as Commander Conrad commented on the abundance of dust . He said the deist flew up in the air as he walked through it , and minute or so later he said his boots were digging into the soil quite a hit . Moments after that , he was saying , " Man , ( lid I get dirt all over myself ! This is what is known as dirt dirt . " He told Commander ( now Captain ) Alan L. Bean , who was still inside the LM , that before they were through they were going to be " a couple of dirty hoogers . " Mr. Gold took a little glass phial from his pocket and rolled it about in his hands . It contained a black-brown substance  --  imitation main dust , which he had made several years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the real stuff that be had got from the Space Center last fall . The grains were so fine they were hard to see , and as he rolled the phial in his hands , the dust tumbled about like dark water . Soon , Commander Bean joined Commander Conrad on the ground and announced that he saw some shiny glass in the rocks at his feet . adding , " You can also see some pure glass if you look around . " Mr. Gold put his moon dust down and began paying close attention , for , he told me , what Commander Bean had described sounded to him like a glazed patch on the surface ( as opposed to the spherules of glass found in the Apollo 11 moon dust ) , and he was anxious to find out whether or not the patch was in a crater . Commander Bean did not say , and Mr. Gold sat hack with a frown . He had recently published a paper in which he suggested that glazed patches on the moon might have resulted from a solar heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be in era- t rs ? whose . concavity would intensify the flash  --  than on the flat ground . Armstrong had said he thought the glass tended to he in craters . The last time I had seen Mr. Gold , he had mentioned the possibility that the flash had taken place within historical times , and now he told me of a Greek myth , from Ovid , concerning a tremendous burst of heat that had set the mountaintops ablaze . After about three-quarters of an hour , the television camera Commander Conrad was setting up on the moon failed when he inadvertently aimed it at the sun , and Mr. Gold was called up before the studio cameras by an A.B.C . producer , to help fill in for the astronauts . A TV technician seated him in a chair next to the rotating moon and tucked a microphone under his lapel . I strolled over to talk with the space-suited man who had been asleep inside the LM cross-section , and he turned out to he Richard Sprague , a consulting pilot for the Grumman Aerospace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one wall of the studio ; it was showing a man dressed as an astronaut carrying lunar experiments past some imitation craters , and Mr. Sprague said , " Hey , that 's me  --  on tape ! Right afterward , I fell on my head and lost my air hose . I bet they do n't show that part . " The studio stage manager , a large man in a yellow shirt , called Mr. Sprague to take his place on the moonscape , where he and another man in a space suit were to set up the experiments  --  live , this time . On television , Mr. Gold was saying that it sounded to him as if the dust was fluffy , and then the cameras switched to Mr. Sprague , who began setting up a seismometer . A few minutes later , Mr. Gold came back to the table , where he tried to listen to what the astronauts were saying . Their voices were sometimes hard to make out , though at one point he distinctly heard them describe a couple of mounds with holes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wish people would stop describing every hole in the ground as a volcano ! " Mr. Gold said irritably . The dust was becoming more of a problem . Some of it was getting on the experiments , where it might cause overheating by-blanketing the white reflective paint , and at one point one of the astronauts commented , " We are really getting dirty out here ! There 's no way to handle all this equipment without getting dust on it . Every time you move something , the dust flies , and in this low gravity it really takes off  --  goes way up in the air and comes in and lands on you . " After these remarks , Mr. Gold said , " I 've been telling NASA for years that there was dust on the moon and that they ought to prepare the astronauts for it , but they never paid any attention . " During a lull in the activities on the moon , I asked Mr. Gold how he ac-counted for the presence of so much more dust at the Apollo 12 site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he did n't think there was much more dust there ; rather , the dust at the Apollo 12 site was fluffier , and consequently more noticeable . The fluffiness might have to do with how recently the dust had settled down , for the longer it had lain in one place , the more tightly com-pacted it would be . It was the compacting of the surface dust that explained why astronauts and lunarr modules did n't sink into it , though even the Apollo 11 site had not been as firm as NASA liked to think , for at one time an astronaut , walking on a crater rim , had sunk in about five inches . ( On earth , he would have sunk into the same kind of dust much far-ther . ) The fact that the dust at the Apollo 12 site was fluffier than that en-countered by the Apollo 11 crew made sense , Mr. Gold said , because the site was nearer the highlands , which is where he believes the dust originates . On earth , soil , which is the result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lowlands by wind and water , but on the moon ( if Mr. Gold is right ) the particles of dust are transported down mountainsides and out onto the Maria by electrostatic currents . Mr. Gold calculates that in the past four billion years I IC so the ? traria could have been filled with up to two kilometres of dust  --  depending on the degree of compacting . If the astronauts should find bedrock on the Illerema , that would make me quite unhappy , " Mr. Gold said . Not long afterward , one of the astronauts said he thought he saw bedrock , but Mr. Gold was not convinced . On the other hand , moat of the geologists at the Space Centel are not at all convinced of Mr. Gold 's theory of electrostatic transportaticm , and at the moment the argument centers around whether moon dust is fine enough to he lifted by an electrostatic current . Some geologists at the Receiving Laboratory have poured the dust through a series of graded sieves as a means of measuring its fineness , and these men say the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Gold , for his part , says that the sieves are n't fine enough to measure the particles , which chimp together and do n't go through the holes , or if they do they come through in strings . Some of the scientists concede Mr. Gold 's point to an extent , though they still say the particles are n't as fine as he thinks they are . " If they bought themselves pocket microscopes , they could see how fine the particles are , " Mr. Gold said to inc . He was eager for the Apollo 12 astronauts to take his camera with them to Surveyor III during their second excursion , later that day , for when the Surveyor had landed on the moon it had bounced and left ripples in the dust ; the Surveyor 's camera had photographed the ripples at the time  --  a series of intersecting ridges forty microns high  --  and Mr. Gold felt that a photograph taken now would reveal microscopic changes in the ripples resulting from electrostatic transportation . Through a crackle of static : , one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rock " The geologists probably think it 's just another piece of glass , butt the iridescence could also be the product of vacuum-plating , " said Mr. Gold , who does n't think much of most geologists ' knowledge of physics . " Vacuum-plating is a simple process ? / can do it in my laboratory . You vaporize a metal in one place and make it form a thin film in another , as in aluminized plastics . ' Iridescent ' is exactly the way a thin layer of metal on a glassy rock would look ! Oh , we need more physicists studying the-moon ! " Mr. Gold believes that moon dust results from evaporation and re-condensation , as in vacuum-plating . Geologists tend to believe that the particles of moon dust were ground down from larger rocks by a mechanical process , such as the abrasive action of micrometeorites . " Supposinc . I look through my microscope and find particles that arc shaped like antlers , " Mr. Gold said . " You would n't expect them to have been eroded from a rock , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the astronauts were hack inside the LM , Mr. Gold telephoned Mr. Pierce in Houston . " What ? " lie said angrily after Mr. Pierce had spoken for a while . " They 've not used our camera at all yet ? ... Do you think they 'll take it to the Surveyor ? It 's absolutely essential that they photograph the ripple pattern .... I hope they got some photographs inside the so-called volcanoes , too .... I trust we will have descriptions of the location of the glassy materials , whether they 're inside the craters or not .... It 's a shame they do n't have the prodding rods along . They could have poked ten or fifteen feet clown into the dust . " AFEW days after the Apollo 12 flight , I visited the Science Staff Support Room , a long , white room with , t high ceiling that is just a few feet from the Mission Control Room , in Houston . It is divided in half by a glass partition , and during the moon walks the scientists whose instruments were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , keeping an eye on a hank of machines that recorded their data , while the geologists and Mr. Pierce sat at two square gray tables in the front . Dr. David Carrier , a civil engineer , who had been at one of the tables , said later , " We had simulated the mission so many times that it was like a recurring dream . The room was semi-dark and crowded . Everyone was watching television and listening through earphones . You had to listen to four different things at once  --  what the astronauts on the moon were saying , what the engineers in the Mission Control Room were saying , the conversation in our room , and the conversation of the medics , in the room next door . You had to learn to filter things out  --  such as the doctor next door asking about the astronauts ' heartbeats while you were trying to talk to the person on your right . Our job was to answer any questions the astronauts had , but we also thought up questions of ow own to ask them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many got to the moon . Once , I asked the depth of penetration of the flagpole into the ground , but I never got an answer . One of my questions did go up , but I ca n't remember what it was , because the whole experience was so like our rehearsals that they and the mission are all mixed up together in 01 ) mind . " The Apollo 12 astronauts had more difficulty with their equipment than the Apollo 11 crew  --  which was a surprise , considering the effort that the aerospace industry had made to remove problems beforehand . To Ray Zedekar , who is an engineer and chief of the Lunar Surface Operations Office , the most serious of the minor difficulties was the loss of a nut on one of the two Hasselhlad cameras . The camera could n't be used anymore , for the nut was on a bolt that screwed the camera to a bracket attached to the astronaut 's space suit . A pin on the flagpole snapped , causing the flag to droop . Later , when the astronauts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nut fell off the top of the scale , and Commander Conrad commented that he would like to rap it on the head of whoever was responsible . " That was n't me , " Mr. Zedekar told me . " We 're only responsible for lunar surface activities . " One problem caused by the cold was that when the astronauts tried to hammer a core tube into the ground , fragments of aluminum coating on the hammer flew off at high speeds . " We already have a fix for that , " Mr. Zedekar said . Some other problems were caused by the cold ; for instance , when the astronauts were putting their smaller sample bags of rocks into the Teflon tote bags , some of the tote bags cracked open . While on the moon , Commander Bean had said that he thought the lunar equipment , which had been made with an eye to saving weight , should be a little sturdier . When I inquired about this , Mr. Zedekar shook his head dubiously and said , " If we put more heft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the moon . " The scientists in the hack of the Science Staff Support Room had their most anxious moment during the Apollo 12 flight when the astronauts seemed unable to remove a foot-long cylinder of radioactive fuel  --  to power the scientists ' instruments  --  from the side of the LM . " We thought we were done for right there , " one scientist said later . The astronauts also had some trouble setting up the experiments , because the wires that connected them to the central station kept trying to roll up again , almost pulling over at least one experiment . The experiment package had been sitting on top of the Saturn rocket at Cape Kennedy for five months , and coils had become set into the wires . The metallic lm ers making up the skirt around the seismometer ( to reflect the sun 's heat and so lessen expansion and contraction of the ground , which could tilt the instrument ) began to separate , and someone suggested that the astronauts pile a little moon dust on the edge of the skirt . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set up without a hitch . Dr. Palmer Dyal , the co-investigator for the magnetometer , said that the astronauts had taken quite a shine to the experiment . " It 's an odd instrument  --  a little package that unfolds to make a big one , " lie said . " They enjoyed working with it . The ) did a better job levelling it on the moon than they 'd ever done on earth . " The scientists remained quiet as their instruments were set up , but they could n't suppress a shout when the central station was turned on . Then each group of scientists gave a cheer as the data from their particular instrument began coming in . Most of the recording machines in the room were in a row . From the right . there were four tall , dull-green cabinets , each containing two metal drums holding sheets of paper on which pens attached to mechanical arms were scratching out the seismic data ; there was a low table with a long sheet of paper unrolling slowly across it , on which other pens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series of consoles , with chairs in Front of them , which were for monitoring the central station . Information from the solar-wind experiment clattered out of an electronic printing machine . Another machine recorded the data from the cold-cathode-gauge experiment and the suprathermal-ion detector . Dr. Gary Latham , the Principal Investigator for the seismometer , was watching a square box at the end of his row of drum recorders . A pen was hurrying back and Forth across a piece of graph paper and drawing four curves  --  one for the instrument 's temperature ( one hundred and twenty - seven degrees and falling ) ; one for the changing tug of gravity on the seismometer ; and two to show the changing tilt of the seismometer as it sat on the moon . The tilt was caused both by changes in temperature ( which made the ground beneath the instrument expand and contract somewhat , in spite of the skirt ) and hy changes in the gravitational field at the lunar surface . By studying the four curving lines , Dr. Latham thought he could sort out the temperature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would tell him how rigid the moon was . The pens on the drum recorders were scribbling feverishly , and Dr. Latham hastened to say that the wiggly lines being made were caused hy background noise , most of it due to the transmitter inside the seismometer . The moon was turning out to be a very quiet place , and Apollo 12 's seismometer had recorded only one natural seismic event . ( There had been an unnatural one , too , for the astronauts had crashed the empty ascent stage of the LM into the moon about forty miles from the seismometer . ) The pens ' jottings went round and round the drums ; a full turn of the drums took one hour , and only a few inches of the squiggles were visible at any one time . Dr. Latham could n't step away for more than a few minutes without running the risk of missing an event and having to wait for it to pop up to the top of the drum again , an hour later . He apparently had stepped away an hour before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ft 's only the second One ! " An hour previously , the moon had rumbled for twenty minutes , during which the pens ' squiggles had increased slowly , reached a climax , and then tapered off again , even more slowly This profile was similar to those of the other seismic events on the moon . The first time , Dr. Latham had thought that the only way to account for the long duration of the signal was to postulate volcanic activity , which can continue for some time . However , when the LM stage crashed into the moon , the noise lasted for fifty minutes , reaching its peak in eight minutes , and Dr. Latham realized that he had probably . been observing impact events all along . Why the moon should ring so strangely is still a mystery . Dr. Maurice Ewing , the director of the Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory , whose staff includes Dr. Latham , believes the ringing means the Oceanus Procellarum is underlain with layers of rock  --  possibly separated by rubble  --  and between these layers shocks resonate , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he prefers the theory of a rubbly substratum  --  no layers . He ca n't say whether the rubble goes all the way to the center of the moon . However , he is looking forward to the time , next March , when NA SA will impact a Saturn IV B rocket booster into the moon two hundred kilometres from a seismometer . The Saturn 's waves would go far deeper into the moon , and make a far more resonant hong . Dr. Latham said he has no idea how long the moon would ring afterward . Dr. Dyal was leaning over the table where data were coming in from his magnetometer  --  exactly as he had been standing , he said , when the magnetometer had been turned on . " Before we flicked the switch , numbers were pouring out of the machine  --  all zeros , " he said . " Then we turned the magnetometer on , and immediately we began getting a magnetic field . We quickly switched to a more sensitive range in order to verify that We really had a field , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associates had n't been at all sure they would measure anything , because Explorer 35 , an unmanned satellite that orbited the moon with a magnetometer aboard , had picked up only the slightest detectable field . The field Dr. Dyal was picking up now was ten times as strong as the field the Explorer had predicted for the lunar surface . And the explanations Dr. Dyal and his associate , Dr. Arthur Sonctt , had were that the solar wind  --  atomic particles streaming from the sun -- had com-pacted the moon 's magnetic field onto the lunar surface , or perhaps that it was a local phenomenon caused by a large meteorite or some subsurface anomaly . The solar wind complicates the interpretation of data from the magnetometer , because it also pushes the rarth 's magnetic field into a sort of comet tail that streams beyond the lunar orbit , increasing the total magnetic field on the moon by about twenty-five per cent when the moon is passing through it . Dr. Dyal would be a lot better off without the solar wind , for as it streams by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waves a bridge pier cuts in a fast river , and every time the moon crosses the earth 's wake the total magnetic field fluctuates wildly . So that he will know what is going on , Dr. Dyal has pasted to his table a diagram showing the earth and all the currents it causes in the solar wind . Dr. Latham thinks this is entirely possible , though he thinks the buildup of The moon 's magnetic field is extremely weak ( only one-tenth of one per cent the waves to their peak was too slow , as strong as the earth 's ) , but the fact that it exists at all excites Dr. Dyal , because , he says , it could mean that the moon  --  regardless of whether it was ever hot  --  was at least warm at one time . The moon could have picked up its magnetic field from the sun or from the earth when the moon was warm , and then retained the field after it had cooled below what is called the Curie point . Since the moon presumably had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field , the field it lad trapped was a very old one , and if it had been trapped from the earth we might he able to learn something about the earth 's early magnetic field . The moon 's field might he from the sun or another source. , however , and Dr. Dyal will know much more about that when he finds how the field is oriented . Learning the field 's direction will require having four magnetometers on the moon ( the present one is the first ) , so that he will he able to see where on the moon the magnetic directions intersect . Dr. Dyal said that all the experiments that have been left on the moon are interrelated . A day or so before , when the moon passed through the earth 's waves , he and Dr. Conway Snyder , the Principal Investigator of the solar-wind experiment , had been running back and forth between each other 's recorders , both of which were fluctuating wildly . Whenever Dr. Latham detects a tremor on the moon , he is apt to glance at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are apt to cause magnetic fluctuations . ( So far , Dr. Latham has seen no significant corresponding jumps on Dr. DyaI 's machine . ) As soon as the seismometer picked up the vibrations after the empty ascent stage of the LM crashed into the moon , Dr. Latham hurried over to the console where data were coming in from the suprathermalion detector , which detects gas particles . The LM had about four hundred pounds of fuel in its tanks , and after the impact the fuel expanded as a cloud of gas , and even though the impact  --  and the center of the gas cloud  --  was forty miles away , the giprathermal-ion detector registered the traces . OVER in Building No. 31 , next door to the Receiving Laboratory , a number of geologists  --  including Dr. Ted H. Foss , the head of the Geology Branch , and Dr. Michael McEwenhad crowded into Dr. John VV . Dietrich 's office to take their first look at the photographs the astronauts had snapped on the moon . All three men had had a hand in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professorial . The pictures , mostly black and white but with some color transparencies , were on a long roll that Dr. McEwen was just beginning to unwind across a white glass table illuminated from below . Dr. Dietrich urged Dr. Mel ' : wen to unwind the pictures a little faster , in order to get through a sequence of diminishing earths and increasing moons and let the geologists get down among the craters . Soon the blacks of space gave way to the browns of the Oceanus Procellarum Because there had been so little tele-vision , this was their first good look at the Apollo 12 site . " The ground has more waves and rip-ples  --  more of a ground swell than the Apollo 11 site , " Dr. Dietrich commented . " Look at this string of materials ! It looks like a ray  --  dust splashed from a crater . " Dr. Me-Ewen thought the ground had a slightly different texture From that of die Apollo 1 1 site it seemed more pit-ted . He rolled the pictures on , slowly . Dr. Foss thought the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were more clearly visible than those at the Apollo 11 site , possibly because there was more dust . Farther on , he found some scratches in the dust that Commander Conrad had made when he scraped a hoop across the ground to gather the contingency sample . " There 's where they pounded in the core tube , " Dr. McEwen said . " Look at the knees of those britches , " Dr. Dietrich remarked as an astronaut , coated in brown dust , flashed across the white table . Dr. McEwen quickly un-wound some footage that Commander ( now Captain ) Richard F. Gordon , Jr. , had taken from the orbiting com-mand module . ( Houston had radioed to him that a mysterious red spot , possibly a volcanic fulmination , had been seen by telescope in the crater Al-phonsus , but when he got there he saw nothing significant . ) Dr. Dietrich said , " Well , I 'll be darned ! " and stopped Dr. 11.11cLwen at a transparency of one of the mounds the astronauts- had called midget volcanoes . All three ge-ologists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look like a volcano to me , " Dr. Foss grumbled . " It looks like a clump of material that was ejected from a crater and did n't break up after it hit the ground . " Farther on , there was a shot of a crater the astronauts had seen on top of the mound . Inside the crater was a rock , and Dr. McEwen , who produced a magnifying glass , said it looked as if the crater had been made by the rock 's hitting the mound Dr. Dietrich said he had had hopes that the mound was a midget volcano . t He was to leave the following week for Hawaii to show the Apollo 13 astronauts some real volcanoes , so that there would he no such confusion next time . ) Dr. Mc-Ewen stopped again at two almost identical photographs of the same rock that were taken just a few feet apart so they could be viewed stereoscopicall3 Dr. McEwen nodded approvingly and placed a stereoscopic viewer over the white table so that the moonscape suddenly became three-dimensional , small craters yawning down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been placed over the rock to indicate its orientation , and presumably this was one of the rocks that the astronauts had collected and that were now m the Receiving Laboratory . Sure enough , the next picture showed the same scene  --  only without the rock , which had been snagged by a pair of tongs and dropped into a Teflon hag . The geologists said the astronauts had done a good job of documenting their samplecolk cting . As the astronauts walked along , taking snapshots as they went , the Surveyor loomed larger and larger . Dr. McEwen stopped at a snapshot of the ripple pattern Mr. Gold had spoken of back in New York . It was still there , though any alterations caused by electrostatic transportation were too microscopic to appear in the snapshot , and the astronauts had n't taken Mr. Gold 's closeup camera with them . " Ton had about that , " one of the geologists said . ( When Mr. Gold found out about this later , he was aghast . " They carried those heavy clippers to cut chunks off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclaimed incredulously . " Here they travel a quarter of a million miles and four and one half billion years into the past , and what do they do ? They bring back a piece of man 's own technol-ogy ! " ) THE astronauts brought back about seventy-five pounds of rocks and dust from the moon . The Apollo 12 rocks differed from the Apollo 11 rocks chiefly in that there were relatively few breccias , which are pebbles compacted into a matrix ( one-third of the Apollo 11 rucks were breccias ) , and a higher proportion of crystalline igneous rocks . The crystals in these rocks were frequently larger than in the igneous rocks from the Apollo 11 flight . Also , the titanium content of the rocks was about half as much as in the first batch . The Australian genchemist Dr. Ross Tailor , who has been in Houston doing the initial chemical analysis on both hatches , says that the rocks from the Mare Tranquillitatis last summer and the rocks from the Oceanus Procellarum this fall " are not brothers , exactly , but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps . " Dr. Brett , who had been pondering over several rocks in the quarantine quarters , told me , " The rocks could n't he better ! If they were the saner as the Apollo 11 rocks , that would be boring . If they were wildly different , that would he like having two pieces from the opposite sides of a jigsaw puzzle . These rocks definitely come from the same part of the puzzle , and we may get some idea of how thk1 fit together . " When I was talking to Dr. Anderson at the Receiving Laboratory , I asked him what the . implication of the larger crystals might he . Before he could answer , a Ere-alarm bell rang and everyone in the building moved outdoors . ( I asked him if the astronauts ? ind Dr. Brett and the others in quarantine would he let out in the event of a fire , and hi- said that that posed a nice problem . ) Coarse grains , Dr. Anderson explained as we sat on a grassy bank at one side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slov , IN , and since cooling occurs most rapidly near the surface of any body , coarse-grained rocks may come from deeper underground than fine-grained rocks . I asked whether igneous rocks deep underground implied volcanism , and he said you could argue either way , depending on which way you were predisposed : Either the coarse rocks had been brought to the surface by lava flows , or a large meteor upon impact had melted enough rock to make a deep pool of lava and , after the pool had cooled , another impact had blasted coarse-grained rocks from the interior of the pool ( which might he a couple of kilometres deep ) up to the surface . The fire proved to be a false alarm , happily for the people in quarantine , and Dr. Anderson returned to the moon rocks . There seemed to be something of a truce between the hot-mooners and the cold-mooners ( as they arc called at the Space Center ) . There was a tentative area of accord between them on one point : regardless of whether the moon had ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long time . I asked Dr. Dietrich , a hot-mooner , whether his ideas were changing , and he said , " Yes , of course . I 've come to accept the idea that the surface is more extensively scarred by meteorites than I had thought . But I 'm still convinced that the rocks at one time melted , flowed , and solidified . And that type of rock means igneous activity . I 'm no less a volcanist than used to he ; volcanism is just shoved farther back in history , that 's alI . " What had shoved the hypothetical period of volcanism farther hack in history was the discovery , by a radioactive dating process , that the Apollo 11 rocks arc between 3.8 and 4.6 billion years old . Since the moon and the planets are thought to be 4.6 billion years old , the rocks may date back to the origins of the solar system . This made the new situation look less like at cHtente than a defeat for the hot-moon men , some of whom were thrown into a state of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer had been a strung advocate of the hot-moon theory , said , " At first , I was skeptical of the evidence , but we had the best people in the world doing the radioactive dating . Their results meant there had been no major thermal event on that part of the moon in over 3.8 billion years . " He was very much puzzled , for that dating made it all but impossible to account for what he had taken as evidence of a long sequence of igneous events on the moon , with what appeared to he craters and lava flows superimposed one upon another . " You need these for a sequence like that , and so I had thought the moon had been volcanically active until relatively recently , " he said . Because of the Apollo 11 rocks , both hot-mooners and cold-mooners were beginning to think in terms of a brief , cataclysmic period , just after the moon was formed , when all the major features were made leaving up in the air the question of how the features came into being . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been hot briefly at its birth , and hot-manners were acknowledging that an early cataclysmic period somewhat favored the idea of impact as the cause of the moon 's features . Everyone was waiting anxiously to see if the Apollo 12 rocks would prove to be as old as the Apollo 11 ones . While the age of the Apollo 12 rocks was being determined , I looked tip Dr. Taylor , who had found that there was only half as much titanium in the Apollo 12 rocks as in the earlier hatch . He said that he had had a narrow escape  --  that he had been in the laboratory with Dr. Brett minutes before the Ieak . " Quarantine would have been a disaster for me , " he explained . " The others have their microscopes back there in quarantine , but I work with an emission spectrograph , which is too big to move . " I wanted to know whether the smaller quantity of titanium affected a theory of the moon 's origin that Dr. Taylor had mentioned to inc last summer  --  the Opik-Ringwood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were formed at the same time out of the same condensing cloud of dust . As the earth formed at the center of the cloud , the particles the outside became extremely hot , burning off elements with lower melting points , until a big proportion of elements with high melting points remained  --  a process called fractionating  --  and later these particles , which formed a ring around the newborn earth , collected to form the moon . Dr. Taylor had said he liked the theory because it explained the presence of the titanium and several other metals that have exceedingly high melting points . I asked him now whether the amount of titanium in the new rocks made the Opik-Ringwood theory less likely , and he said no . " There 's still a high concentration of other refractory metals , and even with the titanium cut in half , ir 's a very high concentration , " he said . " Anyway , any theory of the moon 's formation would have to take into account the high concentrations in the samples from the first site . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the University of California and a leading cold-moonur , whom Dr. Taylor had visited in California last August on his way hack to Australia , had not hcen enthusiastic about the 0 pi k- R in gwooil theory . I had thought he would he , because it provided a way of accounting for the titanium while keeping a cold moon  --  a problem of some concern to Dr. Urey last summer . Dr. Taylor said that Dr. Urey still hoped to prove that the moon was formed elsewhere in the solar system and then was captured in the earth 's field of gravity . Mr. Gold had mentioned a theory that seemed to lend credence to this . Possibly the entire solar system had condensed out of a single hot cloud of gas and dust , with the sun at the center ; eventually , the rest of the cloud formed a series of concentric rings around the sun , and the planets later formed from the rings . In that case , Mr. Gold went on to suggest , perhaps the moon had condensed out of an inner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been hotter than in the vicinity of the earth . ( At the time the planets were forming out of the rings , orbits would have been extremely irregular , making Dr. Urey 's capture theory plausible . ) " That 's 2 fascinating idea , " Dr. Taylor said . " In order to get the concentration of titanium we found in the Apollo I I rocks you have to cook away the equivalent of fifty or it luindred moons . I think my way of doing it is simpler . I 'd fractionate just the earth-moon system , but he 'd fractionate the whole solar nebula , " Dr. Tatilnr , who had talked by telephone to Dr. Urey the day before , went on , " The moon is going to he very interesting from his point of view . It looks as if the moon has been sitting there just as it is now through all geological time , during the whole evolution of the earth , ft 's a remarkably ' primitive place . The dimisams probably saw the same moon we do . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days later . On the basis of the tests made up till then , they were thought to be about 2.5 billion years old , or more than a billion years younger than the few Apollo II rocks that had been tested . Dr. Greenwood , naturally , was delighted , for these findings gave him another bullion years in which his sequence of events could have taken place . The fact that rocks had been formed over a span of more than two billion years made volcanism somewhat more likely than before , and Dr. Taylor , anticipating confirmation of the age of the rocks by the Principal Investigators , was revising his model of the moon to include a period of volcanic activity from perhaps four billion years ago to two billion years ago . Dr. Greenwood , who had once been a hot-mooner , was more cautious about volcanism . Much of the moon was nevertheless very ancient , as the Apollo I 1 rocks had shown . In March , Apollo 13 will land in the highlands , which most selenologists agree are even older than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science has a way of sorting things out , " Dr. Taylor said .
