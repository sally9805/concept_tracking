Condemned , praised and often misunderstood in their 2year lifetime , the nation 's first peacetime wage-price controls now seem destined to die swiftly and unmourned . The House Banking and Currency Committee last week voted 21 to 10 against recommending a bill to extend controls and thus all but guaranteed that the limits will slide into oblivion when the present stabilization law expires April 30. * The vote follows a similar action by the Senate Banking Committee last month . <P> The Cost of Living Council , which the Administration had wanted to retain if only as a largely powerless watchdog agency , apparently will go out of existence too . The House committee failed to act on a separate compromise bill to keep COLC alive ; the overwhelming sentiment among committee members is that it should expire . After dawdling for weeks , the Administration made an eleventh-hour stab at saving COLC , but the move was too weak and came much too late . In the past six months or so , COLC has got many firms and industries , including autos , rubber and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in exchange for being freed from formal control . If COLC vanishes , those agreements will no longer be legally binding , and the companies can lift prices at will . <P> <P> The most disturbing aspect of the congressional decision was that it was taken without even a pretense of searching debate about the wisdom of lifting all controls when prices are soaring and restive unions are bent on pushing for fat pay boosts . Even optimistic Government forecasters expect prices to jump , at least temporarily , when controls die . Prices for steel , processed food , auto parts , machinery and other items are all expected to shoot up when controls are lifted . For the longer run , retail prices on a wide variety of general merchandise-clothing , home furnishings , sterling silverware-will probably be climbing rapidly by fall . The best the Administration can foresee in the absence of controls is that living costs in the months ahead will rise less steeply than they have so far this year . That is hardly encouraging . Consumer prices zoomed at the annual rate of 15.6% in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price run-up in certain areas when controls disintegrate , John Dunlop , chief of COLC , has been the only Administration official vigorously lobbying for continuance of some kind of economic restraints , particularly on the construction industry and medical services . About 4,000 construction labor contracts expire this year , and without some kind of rein , the building trades unions are expected to push for wage increases ranging from about 10% to 34% . Freed from controls , doctors ' fees and hospital charges , in Dunlop 's view , could leap 5% . Yet Dunlop 's repeated warnings were greeted with apathy by congressional leaders .
