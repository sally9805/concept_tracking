THE RAFT OF THE MEDUSA by Vercors . Translated by Audrey Foote. 185 pages . McCall's. $6.50 . <P> <P> Rebellion springs from a psychological source as much as from a political stance . Yet an age that has generated millions of rebels has failed to produce anything like adequate discussion of their emotional motives . Now a shrewd novel by a member of the Old Left offers some home thoughts to the vociferous children of the New . <P> Jean Brller is a French writer who , under the pseudonym of Vercors , founded Editions de Minuit , a French underground press , during World War II and briefly followed the French Communist Party line . On the whole , Vercors seems to distrust the rebellious spirits he has known-especially those whose revolt was mainly verbal . The hero of his sixth novel is a meticulous and withering portrait of what he takes to be the type . <P> The Raft of the Medusa* is set up as a consulting-room thriller and develops the solution to a psychiatric puzzle : Why does a young Frenchwoman who says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Veronal ? Her analyst suspects she has borrowed trouble from her husband , a French poet-novelist whose stock in trade is glamorous rebellion . Called in for consultation , the husband really wants to level , but beneath the lacquer of glory he can perceive only one small flaw in himself : " Despite the success of my books , I have no confidence . " Through that tiny portal of awareness the analyst enters a hidden emotional hell . <P> Fury at human imperfection is the first symptom of the hero 's malady . As a teen-age poet , having made the banal discovery that his parents are far from perfect and that the whole world is wicked , he spews out a book of vitriolic verses advertising his family as an archetypal clan of upper-middle-class monsters . By besmirching their reputation he established his own . But his success becomes his fate . In literature he is merely a marked-down Rimbaud who curses a corrupt society as a way of joining it ; in private life he is a frightened , self-seeking , self-deceiving fumbler . The book 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hero 's fear of love makes him lose the girl he should have married , how his habit of self-ignorance allows him to repress his grief , how his hypocrisy and weakness eventually poison his marriage and destroy his closest friendship . <P> The book takes detours of recollection through World War II and the moral agonies of the French Resistance . In fact , Vercors touches on enough material for a 600-page chronicle . Yet he has chosen to tell his story with unleavened haste in a brisk series of interviews between patient and analyst . In art as in life , the device frequently proves a chore . <P> <P> But the reader is kept on a taut leash of suspense , and the hero finally becomes a breathing instance of a truth that the radical left tends to overlook . However politically useful they may be , gadflies are born , not made . <P> <P> - The title is taken from a Gericault painting that depicts with romantic overkill the pain and bestiality of a raftful of men and women who , in 1816 , survived the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for 16 days without rescue . Their actions came to symbolize the voracious selfishness of 19th century bourgeois society .
