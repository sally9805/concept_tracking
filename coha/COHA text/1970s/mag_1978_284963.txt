Medicine 's most powerful weapons against pain are the opiates , substances such as heroin and morphine that are derived from opium . But only in the past few years have scientists understood why and how the human body responds to these drugs from the poppy plant . For contributing to that understanding , three men last week won the Albert and Mary Lasker Foundation 's prestigious Basic Medical Research Award . <P> Sharing the $15,000 prize were Dr. Hans Kosterlitz of the University of Aberdeen in Scotland , Pharmacologist John Hughes of the Imperial College of Science and Technology in London and Dr. Solomon Snyder of Baltimore 's Johns Hopkins University . <P> Snyder and his co-workers discovered in 1973 that the nerves of the brain and spinal cord contain specific sites to which opiates must bind in order to produce their effect . Morphine and similar drugs fit into these so-called opiate receptors like a key into a lock . Once in the lock , the drugs are able to dampen pain signals to the brain . Snyder then went on to map the distribution of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the research . They wondered why the body should evolve receptors for foreign narcotics ; perhaps the body produced its own opiates . In 1975 they discovered and isolated two such compounds from pig brains and dubbed them enkephalins ( from the Greek words for in the head ) . <P> Enkephalins seem to be present in all vertebrates . They are part of the body 's protective biochemical system for coping with pain and stress . Scientists suggest that people who can stand more pain than others may be able to call forth extra supplies of enkephalins . Those with a low tolerance for pain may be deficient in either receptor sites or enkephalins . <P> The discoveries also help explain narcotic addiction . Scientists speculate that under normal conditions , enkephalins bind to a certain number of receptor sites . Morphine acts to relieve pain by filling the remaining sites . But too much morphine overloads the system , causing enkephalin production to be cut off . More morphine is needed to fill the receptors and produce relief . If the narcotic is then withheld , all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With this knowledge , researchers hope to design nonaddictive pain relievers . <P> The enkephalins appear also to affect emotions . In mapping receptor sites Snyder found that the amygdala , a small portion of the brain that has no known role in physical pain but plays a major part in regulating the emotions , is unusually rich in opiate receptors . Thus variations in the number of receptors , or in the concentration of enkephalins-or the presence of narcotics-at these sites may affect emotions and behavior . Said Kosterlitz at the Manhattan award presentation : " The discovery of the enkephalins resembled the opening of Pandora 's box , hopefully this time for the benefit of mankind .
