Even his future is in jeopardy . - All because of this disease . ? " I 've lost a wife because of it , " he says . " I 've lost three jobs because of - it , and lost $10,020 in 10 years trying to cure ' it . " The disease that is eating away at 40-year-old Paul Whiteneir is not infecting his body . It is , he admits freely , all in his head . But still , he Close-up r With Anne Keegan insists , his condition is critical . ? For what is tormenting this computer engineer , immobilizing him and slowing down his career , is not an uncommon disease . It affects millions of persons across the country : THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flying . " " And , " Whiteneir says , " it has // 1500 From page one Incurable ' fear of flying // been creating havoc in my life ever since I ? got it . A lot of people have a fear of flying but they do n't have to fly . My profession has demanded that I fly , and when I could n't , I lost the job or did n't get a better . one because I could n't even fly out to interview for them . " For a good part of Whiteneir 's life , he was a healthy man with a healthy attitude toward commercial airplanes and flying . " I must have flown 100 times , " he says . " I could get on a plane , lean back and relax , and I was never scared at all . " But then , in 1967 , he was on a commercial turboprop airplane when two engines went out and the plane dropped straight down from 25,000 feet . " The woman next to me was screaming and we kept going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled out of it , " he says . " I HAD , TO GET otf that plane and climb on another , " Whiteneir says , " and the pilot 's door was open . I saw him start ' the right engine and then try to start the left engine . It would n't start : And it would n't start . " I sat there getting more and more anxious and suddenly I stood up and said , ' I 've got to get off this thing , ' and that 's when the disease first struck me . " All of a sudden I had this fear of flying and I thought to myself , ' Now , what am I going to do ? ' This disease reared its ugly head just when I had gotten a promotion and was climbing the management ladder , and of course , as a member of management , you were expected to fly . But the fear of flying had me grounded . " Whiteneir went along all right for several years because he was not asked to fly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembers , " my boss told me I would have to fly out to New Jersey . He gave me two months ' warning . " SO I SIGNED up for ground school , thinking that if I learned as an engineer how planes fly and how to read instruments , I would lose this ridiculous fear . " Then I paid a pilot to take me up around and around day after ( lay in a small plane  --  somehow I did that . It was the commercial planes that had me scared . " Well , the time came to go to New Jersey and I took pills and drank doubles and got on , somehow . But I was scared all the way . " Soon , I had an offer for a job out East . " My wife said she 'd go with me to New York and somehow I got on that commercial flight . It was the last flight I 've ever been on . It was such a terrifying experience for me I vowed never to fly again . " After the interview @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reports . And when we got to the airport , just my wife flew off . I stayed. , I could n't do it . While she was landing back at home , an hour and a half later , / , was just getting on a Greyhound Bus for Cleveland . " THEN I WENT to the airport and watched people get off airplanes and I asked them if their flights were smooth . I was going to try flying again , but I could n't make myself walk on a plane . I rented a car and drove back home . It took three days in all . " Since then Whiteneir has been grounded . Paralyzed . Unable to climb onto any commercial plane and terrified just thinking about it . " I 've been , to different psychologists , psychiatrists , even a hypnotist , " Whiteneir says . " It 's cost the thousands . I called an astrologist , who said my charts say I wo n't die if I fly . ? " I 've bought every book I can find on fear and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete library . " But nothing has worked . In 1976 my boss told me I had to fly to California , for a tweek . Everyone else- flew out on Sunday night for a Monday morning meeting , but I left Friday morning and took the train . " MY WIFE called in the middle of the week'and said there was a crisis and to be back home Friday . But I could n't climb on a plane . I took the train and got home ' Sunday night . " When-I walked in the door , my wife said , ' You took too long , I 'm leaving you . ' And she did . She moved out the next week , that 's how I lost my wife . " The . most recent job Whiteneir ' lost because of his fear of flying was a year ago , when Whiteneir 's psychologist at the time drove him to the airport to try to stuff him personally into the plane . - Whiteneir could n't get on . " So , " Whiteneir said , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loaded and pour me on . But it did n't work . I was so scared I did n't even get drunk . " But I had to call my boss and tell him that I was still sitting at O'Hare while seven people were waiting for me and my computer presentation in California . " " HE WAS very nice about it but he said he had to let me go because my job entailed flying and I would n't fly . They had hired me knowing of my fear , and they had given me six months to cure it . I ' tried everything but I did n't make it . So , there went that job . " There went a lot of jobs I could n't get because ' I ca n't get on a plane . I , ca n't go into ' management  --  for everyone in management has to fly . In a job like mine , you are expected to fly . My future is crippled . They think you are crazy , silly , when you say you ca n't put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all in my head , " Whiteneir says , " and I ca n't get it out . I have been working for 10 years on ft and not found a cure . But I can not accept that there is no cure  --  somewhere there must be one . Or someone will come up with one . " Because I 've got to be cured . I 've got a new job , had it for one month . I 'm holding my breath until that day they say , ' Paid , Take aplane . ' I have to get cured . I ca n't lose another job . " Or another wife . Because my present wife hates trains . " Tribune Photo by Luigi niendicino Paul Whiteneir
