Nostalgia ai n't what it used to be . <P> - Peter De Vries <P> THE newest hot ticket on Broadway these days-$55 a pair from scalpers - is an admission to a haunted house . Elegiac strains of the ' 20s , ' 30s and ' 40s hover in the wings . Ectoplasmic chorines , all beads and feather boas , wander across the stage like Ziegfeld girls come back to life . Characters are at once 19 and 49 . Time bounces off the walls , like sound and light brilliantly altered and distorted . <P> The show at the Winter Garden Theater* is called Follies , a title self-consciously suggesting irony and double meanings . At its worst moments , Follies is mannered and pretentious , overreaching for Significance . At its best moments-and there are many-it is the most imaginative and original new musical that Broadway has seen in years . <P> At first look Follies would seem to be part of the nostalgia boom , which has America glancing myopically backward at its own past ( see TIME ESSAY , page 77 ) and has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trend toward old goldies began on Broadway in May 1969 with a production of the Hecht-MacArthur war horse about a journalism that never was : The Front Page , starring Robert Ryan . The play whetted the theater audience 's appetite for aging stars and graying gags . After it galloped Three Men on a Horse , Our Town with Henry Fonda , Noel Coward 's Private Lives , the adventures of the Marx brothers in Minnie 's Boys , Helen Hayes and James Stewart in Harvey . Some musical comedies , like 1968 's Dames at Sea , were a pastiche of the past , filling off-Broadway with tinkling resonances of Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler . Some took old movies , tricked them out with old stars and called themselves new-like Applause , which is a face-lifting of All About Eve , plus orchestra and Lauren Bacall . <P> <P> A Sense of Freshness <P> No , No , Nanette , of course , outnos-talgiaed them all . The hell with getting someone like Ruby Keeler and Patsy Kelly ; they went out and got Keeler and Kelly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of geriatric routines . The show is a collage of ricky-ticky-tacky , but it shines because of the adroit staging of Burt Shevelove and the even more adroit hoofing of Helen Gallagher and Bobby Van . <P> The genuine surprise in the nostalgia nonsense is not the durability of the vehicles or the performers , but the sense of freshness emerging from all this wallowing in memory . That , precisely , is the delight of Follies . Superficially , its cast may appear to be just another line-up of Late Show dropouts ; and its theme could have been one more excuse to laugh or cry at the kind of song and dance that dazzled a less sophisticated generation . But in its staging , and above all in its music and lyrics , Follies is astonishingly futuristic-more modern , really , than that calculated rock-beat ode to the counterculture , Hair . <P> <P> Full of Ghosts
