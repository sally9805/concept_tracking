Anger at the industry helps an Alaska conservation bill <P> Tip O'Neill stood in his Speaker 's office and waved a big hand toward the floor of the House . " The oil industry is in rough shape out there , " he declared . " The members think they 're voting against another rape by Big Oil . " <P> Big Oil clearly was in trouble . By a vote of 268 to 157 , the House had just approved a proposal that the industry thought it could defeat : legislation that would set aside 126 million acres of Alaska 's most spectacular wilderness . The bill would place stringent limits on how the land could be developed by oil companies looking for new sources of petroleum , as well as by lumber and mining interests . The most sweeping land conservation legislation in U.S. history , the bill would preserve an area slightly larger than California . It would also protect the great caribou herds in the Arctic Wildlife Range , the spawning beds of the Pacific salmon in the Misty Fjords along the state 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of American bald eagles on Admiralty Island and the habitat of the whistling swan in the southwest . <P> Before the vote , Congressman Mo Udall , one of the bill 's sponsors , had feared the gasoline shortage would give industry lobbyists a powerful argument for approval of an opposing measure that would have opened 63 million acres of Alaska 's wildlife refuges to oil exploration and hard-rock mining . With long lines forming outside California gas stations , Udall warned , " This is the worst time to bring this bill up . " <P> But O'Neill sensed a different sentiment on the floor . He knew that members of the House had been blistered by their constituents for turning down President Carter 's plan for stand-by gasoline rationing . The Speaker also realized that the voters were fed up with the oil companies . " I 've never seen the public so mad , " O'Neill told reporters . " You take away gasoline and you destroy the family . That 's the way they feel . " Indiana Democrat John Brademas saw another reason for the vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a feeling of protecting the great natural legacy of Alaska . It 's a triumph for the environmental ethic . " <P> The bill was itself a compromise between the views of the developers and the strict conservationists . A total of 67 million acres would be designated as wilderness areas , in which little commercial activity is permitted . Still , the bill would permit oil companies to develop new sources of petroleum in 95% of the state 's total area . The bill would also give concessions to certain established developers and open 22.5 million acres in the North Slope area west of Prudhoe Bay as a " national petroleum reserve " in which private companies could seek and produce oil . <P> Republican Don Young , the state 's lone Congressman , called the bill " illegal and immoral " and " a terrible thing for the people of Alaska . " Udall sharply disagreed , noting that the federal lands left untouched by the bill are " twice the size of California and can be used as they please by the 400,000 people of Alaska . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Udall added : " The 220 million people of America are entitled to the preservation of the last great areas of wild beauty in the U.S. "
