In the 1960s mainstream Protestants in America were swept up in such social crusades as civil rights and opposition to the Viet Nam War . Since then , however , something of a reaction has set in . Denominations have trimmed their social sails , and many activist preachers have turned inward , emphasizing personal psychological needs . <P> Theologians too have shifted ground . Some have feared that the swing toward social involvement undercut belief in a God who ultimately transcends the affairs of this world . A year ago , a group of them met in Hartford , Conn. , and issued a dramatic " Appeal for Theological Affirmation " ( TIME , Feb. 10 ) . <P> The Hartford group-mostly Protestant but with a number of Roman Catholics and Eastern Orthodox joining in the effort-hurled anathemas against 13 " false and debilitating " themes , including the belief that " the struggle for a better humanity will bring about the Kingdom of God . " <P> That aroused the liberals , who were already on the defensive and felt that the Hartford appeal strengthened a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of responses to Hartford was unleashed by a 21-member task force of the Boston Industrial Mission. * It is a counterattack called " The Boston Affirmations " and it constitutes a theological rallying cry against any retreat from social action . <P> Insisting that the Social Gospel is not dead , the Boston group is enthusiastic about the struggle by the world 's poor for a better material life , the drive for " ethnic dignity , " women 's campaign against " sexist subordination " in church and society , and efforts to foster a love for cities as " centers of civility , culture and human interdependence . " <P> If the last sounds like an echo of the liberal Protestant bible of the mid-1960s , The Secular City , it is no coincidence . The best-known member of the Boston group is that book 's author , Harvey Cox of Harvard Divinity School , who joined the other signers in the scruffy B.I.M. office to celebrate the " Affirmations " with a liturgy and a lunch of jug Burgundy and ham-and-cheese sandwiches .

Despite the continuing argument , there is some convergence between heavenly Hartford and worldly Boston . The Hartford theologians , no social dropouts , insist that emphasis on God 's " transcendence " and traditional faith is not only compatible with social action but strengthens it . The Bostonians profess that God " brings into being all resources , all life " and , on that basis , insist that Christians have a responsibility to tackle social ills . The argument proceeds through eight sections , bearing traditional titles ( " Creation , " " Fall " and " Exodus " ) . <P> The Boston statement ends on a note of eloquence . When Hartford-style " spiritual blindness " wins out , it says , " the world as God 's , creation is abandoned , sin rules , liberation is frustrated , covenant is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffering love is transformed into triviality.
