Brain scan ends a career <P> Thomas Kpcke , 18 , was one of West Germany 's more promising young boxers . Just last year the sturdily built youth was runner-up in his nation 's junior heavyweight competitions . Now Kpcke 's career has been brought to an abrupt halt by an X-ray device known as the CAT scanner . <P> During one of the routine , twice-yearly physical examinations required for all boxers under West German regulations , a standard electroencephalogram showed an " irregularity " in Kpcke 's brain-wave pattern . Doctors then used the CAT ( for " computerized axial tomography " ) scanner to make cross-section images of the boxer 's brain and discovered , in their words , " a fairly common , apparently congenital anomaly between the cerebrum and cerebellum " -a condition that might make him particularly susceptible to injury from blows to the head . Hamburg 's amateur boxing association believed it had no other choice ; it banned the apparently robust Kpcke from ever boxing again , thus making him a fighter kayoed by the CAT .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
