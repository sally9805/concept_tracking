Outside New York , there were quite a few cocky power company executives who said about the possibility of blackouts : " No , it ca n't happen here . " There were some who pooh-poohed Consolidated Edison 's " act of God " explanation as unconvincing . There were a number who blamed Con Ed 's own defects and described with pride the superior safety features of their own systems . Yet on closer consideration , few power executives were willing to say flatly-and publicly-that they could offer ironclad security against the same sort of failure . <P> Systems from Boston to Los Angeles protect themselves with tie-ins to multistate power pools and with automatic " load shedding " controls that temporarily cut off some customers when overloads threaten . Yet New York too relied on those devices , and they were not enough . <P> Of course some of New York 's problems are unique . Nowhere else in the U.S. is power failure likely to last as long as 25 hours ; New York has more underground cable than any other system-80,837 miles of it-and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines . And because each section of Manhattan 's power grid sucks as much power as a small city , the restoration of power in each neighborhood had to proceed slowly and carefully to avoid sudden overloads on the system . Earlier this month , when fire destroyed an electric cable in St. Louis , it took only eight hours to restore power to the 40-block downtown area . <P> Power lines travel into most cities from several directions , but all the major cables connecting Con Ed to other pools of electric power run in a single corridor from the north . Last week a storm apparently knocked out all eight of these lines within an hour . Says an executive of Chicago 's Commonwealth Edison : " If a major line goes out here , we can interchange a lot more easily and flexibly . " One reason for the difference : Commonwealth Edison can more readily obtain right-of-way for power lines in Midwestern farmlands than can Con Ed in the crowded Eastern Megalopolis . <P> <P> But to the extent that geography adds to the vulnerability of major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the peninsular state of Florida , all the lines to power pools elsewhere run up and down in a fairly narrow corridor . Last May 2.5 million residents in five Florida counties ( including Miami 's Bade County ) were without power for approximately four hours after the electric system short-circuited.
