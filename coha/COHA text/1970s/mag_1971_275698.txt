There is a dawning world-around comprehension Of the existence of a significant plurality Of alternative energy source options Available for all Earthians ' vital support . . . <P> Disturbed last month by the specter of an oil refinery proposed for Searsport , Me. , not far from his beloved summer home on Bear Island , Buckminster Fuller , 75 , fired off a protesting telegram to Maine Senator Edmund S. Muskie . The basic message could have been put in 21 words : URGE YOU BLOCK THIS AND ALL OTHER REFINERY PROJECTS ON MAINE 'S COAST . ALTERNATE ENERGY SOURCES ARE AVAILABLE . CALL ME FOR DETAILS . But Bucky Fuller-author , architect , inventor , philosopher - operates on a grand scale . He turned to free verse , and the orotund result almost filled the entire Op-Ed page of the New York Times . <P> Fuller emphatically opposes the burning of fossil fuels ( oil , coal ) , which not only are in limited supply on earth but also pollute air and water . To go on using oil and coal , he wrote , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a bank vault Pumping out money And calling it free-enterprise discovery . . . <P> Total System . Fuller prefers tapping the sun 's " cosmically inexhaustible energy " or harnessing the tides , possibly in the Bay of Fundy . In addition , he would like to see all nations and continents hooked into a global energy grid , with electricity flowing efficiently across time zones to meet distant peak-hour demands . He envisions " a total-humanity sustaining system " that would decrease birthrates and increase longevity . In short , Fuller 's poetic excursion was mind expanding , if not mind exploding . <P> Muskie took some time to unravel Fuller 's visionary verse . But last week he replied in the Times with 44 lines of his own bad poetry . After reeling off a few contemporary images- " nemesis clouds , " " putrid smoke , " " noxious oxides " - he got to Fuller 's Maine point : <P> A nd the rockbound coast Is threatened by the super Tankers disgorging crude oil On the tide . . . <P> Muskie has no power to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a potential presidential candidate , he ended his answer to Fuller on the right hortatory note . Allowing that the U.S. has " the knowledge , the skill and the treasure " to save its environment , the Senator thundered : " Only our dedication - commitment- is in doubt . "
