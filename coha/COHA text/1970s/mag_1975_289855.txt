Hail Nero Shero and His Bullies ! <P> To the Editors : <P> Hockey Feb. 24 is a sport of grace and finesse-a flowing , whirling , incredibly fast spectacle of great beauty and only occasional explosions of violence . Fred Shero and his bush-league bullies are perverting this finest of games and transforming it into a scene of bloody brutality and mindless pugilism more suitable to the ancient Roman arena . <P> Hail Nero Shero ! <P> ( Mrs. ) Ruth Racheter <P> Cold Spring , N.Y . <P> Violence can be construed as the " essence " of hockey only in the sense that it is the attraction for the multitude who do not appreciate . To the true fan , violence is simply an inherent and ( to an extent ) controllable byproduct of this highly charged game in which emotion often gets the better of one 's social graces . <P> While I deplore the Forbes-Boucha incident and acknowledge the need to further clean up the game , I would warn also against creeping alarmism . <P> Jim Karas <P> Lansing , Mich . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it should not be surprising that the spectator following should be so rabid , particularly in the congested metropolitan areas where legitimate expressions of violence are so limited . Many of the " silent majority " who feel so frustrated , angry and helpless today can readily identify with the beleaguered , assaulted hero of the " war on ice . " They experience a vicarious satisfaction from the open aggression and mayhem on the ice , and indeed , it is powerfully exhilarating to let one 's emotions " all hang out . " <P> The ultimate question , of course : Is it worth the price-not only in terms of the ticket price but of the costs to the gladiators ? Also , in terms of any greater social benefit , is there less violent crime in Philadelphia the nights the Flyers are playing in the Spectrum ? Until enough people decide it is not worth the price , we may expect little change in the trend toward increasing violence in hockey and other contact sports . <P> W.

Considerable misinformation has been circulated by opponents of ERA , and it is good to know that Mrs. Ford is helping to set the record straight . <P> On the more general question of the proper role of a First Lady with regard to public issues , I believe our First Ladies should be free to enter the political thicket whenever they think it appropriate . Some First Ladies have shunned nearly all public involvement ; others have concentrated on noncontroversial causes ; and a few , like Eleanor Roosevelt , have been in the forefront of the struggle for social and political change . There is no right or wrong answer ; there is only the personal answer each First Lady gives . <P> Eleanor McGovern <P> Washington , D.C. <P> Tory Margaret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
