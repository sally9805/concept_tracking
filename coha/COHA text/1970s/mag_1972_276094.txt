Before 18-year-olds won the right to vote last summer , not a single school board in the country had a student member . As of now , there are 13 of them , and more than 100 other teenagers are expected to campaign for school-board vacancies this spring . <P> Some of the innovations proposed by student members are startling . The most controversial of the newcomers is Newark 's Larry Hamm , 18 , a black student at Rutgers University , who attracted widespread criticism by calling for Black Nationalist liberation flags to be flown in every Newark schoolroom where black pupils form a majority ( TIME , Dec. 13 ) . Hamm , once considered a docile " model student , " has also encouraged noisy claques of youths to attend board meetings and has endorsed a long list of their demands . Among them : the replacement of all public schools that are more than 100 years old ( two-thirds of the city 's 79 schools ) ; the exclusion of white teachers from black-history programs ; the teaching of African languages such as Hausa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Several of Hamm 's proposals have already won approval by the board . He got it to change the names of South Eighth Street School and South Side High School to the Martin Luther King Jr . School and Malcolm X. Shabazz High School . At his urging , school administrators accelerated their efforts to have " the accomplishments of black people " routinely included in every subject area , not confined to black-studies courses . He also persuaded the board to give high school students instructions-and time off-for registering to vote . <P> Not surprisingly , Hamm 's outspoken tactics have made him enemies . John Cervase , a 59-year-old attorney and the board 's most pugnacious white member , argues that Hamm should not be on the board at all . " This city 's schools are like a company with $1 billion in assets and a budget of $100 million a year , " he says . " Can you conceive of an 18-year-old child effectively administering General Motors ? " <P> Few of the other young contenders are radicals , but they do have strong feelings about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get herself elected this week to the school board in Willingboro , N.J. , so that she can try to change the rule that got her suspended from school last year for refusing to stand up and recite the Pledge of Allegiance to the flag ( she had argued in vain with the authorities that the U.S. did not truly provide " liberty and justice for all " ) . Terry Smith , 18 , a bespectacled blonde who works part time as a waitress , has had teams of volunteers distributing 8,000 handbills for that same February 8 election in Ewing Township . " They may think I 'm childish , " she says , " hut if childish means more communication and more understanding , then I 'm all for childish ideas . I know what goes with curriculum and discipline and things that concern students . Like cigarettes . It seems unfair that kids who can smoke at home get expelled for three days when they 're caught at school . And lunches . We have terrible lunches . Yecch ! "       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
