The OtherIVHalf an hour later , Niles , feeling better , sits at the end of the landing , spine curved against a post , his line hanging in the back eddies , his eye following the lead sinker as it twinkles an instant , then drags the filament from sight . Along the river , among the willows , the afternoon is spread lavishly , like a picnic on a checkered cloth of light and shade . Overhead , faces in the clouds  --  that one there , look  --  two eyes , a nose .. . Phew , it was hot ; Holland was right  --  fishing is a bore . Why would n't he come pick cattails for the Winter Kingdom ? Why get mad at Russell , do that to his pet ? Now he was sulking , up there in the loft , independent Holland . Still and all , he 'd flash that grin and you 'd forgive him . By supper time , sure . At least he , Niles , would . He could n't speak for Russell but Russell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line yanked ; he reeled it in . Breaking the stillness , shattering the mirror of water , a catfish leaped into the air . Niles jumped up and swept his rod back . The fish flopped onto a plank , its scaleless pewter body jerking in spasms . He put a foot on it , carefully avoiding the barbels on either side of its mouth as he extracted the hook . Again the fish jumped ; he pulled his hand away and a drop of blood appeared on its tanned downy surface . Sucking the injured flesh , he cast his line again , and saw the stream draw it toward a half-submerged rowboat ; a stripThe Other 41of red along the curving gunnel wavering in the water resembled a wound . His line drifted through a rusted oarlock , a thread through the eye of a needle . He sighed , made himself more comfortable , dug out the ring from the tobacco tin , and , crossing one leg over his knee , slid it onto a toe . He raised his foot against the sky and watched the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nibelung gold . He daydreamed for a time , then put the ring away . His eyelids felt heavy ; he could not keep them from drooping .. . closing . The hour itself was drowsy , the air hushed , an atmosphereof quiet thrills . . . in his ear he heard the maidens splashing . . . enticing Rhine maidens with flowing hair and lovely sinuous bodies . . . romantic creatures , hoarding their river gold . . . he dozed .. . " Douschka ? " He jerked his head up , his eyes blinking in the sunlight . She was standing a short distance away , on the planks of the landing , observing him quizzically , a flower-laden basket on her arm , her face shadowed by the parasol . Ada ; weathered and lined face , grizzled hair pinned in a careful , old-fashioned knot at her neck , baked-apple skin still drawn taut across high cheekbones , in places almost translucent , with the effect of a fine teacup held to the light . Spare but strong , she held herself erect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her step  --  she never walked but moved with long strides  --  her shoulders set and determined . Keen brown eyes , amused , lively , authoritative , heavy-lidded like a hawk 's , with edges that held the colors of certain seashells  --  bluish , with a tinge of purple , even silver in them . Hands large , gnarled , brown , capable-looking , and an air of magic about them . Like everythingabout her , an air of magic . She came closer , her chin outthrust , and in her smile was a soft , childlike innocence , which is sometimes the way with42 The Othergrandmothers . Her dress , a modest bouquet of printed flowers , whispered around bare tanned legs ; at her breast a pin , crescentshapedlike a new moon , catching the sun 's rays between golden horns . Niles reeled in his line and ran to meet her . " Dobryi den ' , Madame . " " Dobryi den ' , grazhdahnin . " She smiled at his greeting and hid her nose at the catfish he waved , trophy-like . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not care for fish , " she laughed . " Here all the fish have bones . The shad  --  nothing but bones . " " But the roe  --  you like shad roe . With bacon ? " " The roe I like , yes . Fish eggs  --  " " Ick ! " He wrinkled his nose and dropped his catch . " They look like pollywog eggs . You eat them and they 'll grow into frogs and jump around inside you like Mexican jumping beans . Like this . " Letting go his pole , tongue lolling , he hopped up and down , hugging himself and making ludicrous faces . She pressed her hand below her heart as though to be mirthful hurt her . " Oh , douschka , such nonsense . " " It 's true ! And cherries  --  you swallow cherry seeds and they 'll sprout out your ears . Or your  --  " " Niles .

Ringling Brothers will come and get you and put you in their show . " He giggled . " Like Mr. La Fever ? " Mr. La Fever , Arnie La Fever 's father , worked in the circus sideshow . " Hush , do not say such things . You have an imp sitting right there "  --  she touched his shoulder  --  " who provokes you . " The Other 43He shifted his gaze upwards . " See that cloud ? Does n't that look like Holland 's face , a little ? " She peered up under her parasol , cocking her head one way and another , scrutinizing . " Why yes , perhaps it does , " she said , indulging his whim . " The nose , however , is wrong . Do you see  --  it is too long . More Cyrano than Holland . " " But see how tilty the eyes are  --  almond-shaped , like a Chink , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not Chink , " she gently chided . " Chinks are found in walls and usually get plastered . " " Like Uncle George , " he said , capering . " Niles . " " Well , I heard Aunt Vee say that 's what he was last  --  " " Child , do n't be impertinent . " She tried to sound severe , but he could tell she did n't mean it , which is also the way with grandmothers . For a while they amused themselves making out interesting faces and shapes from the procession of puffy clouds overhead : an elephant , a ship with sails , a buffalo , three fat ladies " with hu-u-uge behinds ! " Niles described arcs in the air with his arms . " What have you done to your hand now ? " She took it and inspected the injury . " We must put some Listerine on that . " Listerine was her panacea for all the maladies of life . " No , it 's okay , honest . " Resisting her ministrations , he sucked again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belonging to you ? " " No . " " And you have tennis shoes of your own . Why do you persist in wearing the old ones of Holland ? " Ach , she thought with amused dismay , how far apart were children and old ladies . How could she think to try to bridge the gap ? While44 The Othershe squeezed his finger to make the blood flow , he looked past her bent head where , up in the meadow , he saw Mr. Angelini under his straw hat , working along the windrows , saw a flash of red as he paused to wipe his face with a bandana . At the barn there were other glimpses of bright color : at the pigeon loft up in the cupola a bit of pink at the west window where Holland was lingering , mouthing his harmonica ; lower down , at the hayloft hatch , Russell Perry in blue , pausing in his solitary pastime to hang again on the pulley rope . " And what have you been up to , this day of days ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you . " " Nothing . " " I see . God gives us a glory of a day and you do nothing with it . Since school is out shall you dawdle away the summer ? I have sewed name tapes in all of your things and Winnie has bought you that nice celluloid soap box and soap  --  " " Lifebuoy , ick. " "  --  yet you will not go to camp . And you know it takes money to send boys to camp . " " Yes . " But no , he meant , no camp . There was one on a nearby lake and Mother had said there would be money enough , but no , Holland did n't want to go , did n't like the games , the groups , did n't care much for playmates . Holland liked staying home , liked playing in the apple cellar , in the pigeon loft . There was going to be a show  --  " And the proceeds will go toward sending another child to camp , " he explained , " some more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I do not think such a child exists . " " What d' you mean ? ' " I mean children who can go to camp but do n't choose toThe Other 45may spend some of their vacation time in the hands of Mrs. Jewett . " Horror struck ! Mrs. Jewett tutored arithmetic , in which subject Niles had been floundering ever since long division . " Oh cripes  --  " " Must you use such expressions , dear ? " Ada said sweetly , her face adamant behind her smile . Ada meant business ; Mrs.Jewett loomed . " Now tell , what have you been doing today ? " " Well , I did lots of things . I went down to the Center andgot your corn plasters  --  " " Thank you . " " Welcome . And your pills are over the sink in the kitchen . You have one more refill on the prescription . " " Thank you . " " Welcome . And I practiced . " " Your piano ? " " No , my magic . For the show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holland 's tricks . " She pressed the tips of her fingers to her mouth and spoke behind them , her tone a little wistful . " What sort of tricks , then ? " " A card trick . It 's called a Royal Marriage  --  you do it with all the picture cards . " " Court cards , yes . " " And then there was a funeral . Another funeral . I had it . I did the digging . Remember last month when the bird died ? Well , today  --  " " Child . " She urged him to calm himself , for excitement had crept into his voice and she saw that his face was flushed . " Yes , another funeral . It was sad . A rat died . " " Died ? How ? " " It just  --  died . Holland told me to get rid of it , so I did . " She interrupted him with a look . " Holland did ? " " Yes . " 46 The Other " And ? " " And so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I found this cracker box and I put the rat in it and took Mr. Angelini 's trowel and buried the box in the aspergrass . Then I wanted to put flowers on the grave , only I gave them to Mother instead . " " To Zan ? " " Yes . Clover . It was clover , the kind she likes , so I gave it to her . She  --  " " Yes ? " " Nothing . " He had started to confide Alexandra 's secret . He sat down on the landing and patted a plank beside him . Disdaining the hand he offered , she removed her canvas shoes  --  the fabric over the little toes was cut with X 's to ease her corns  --  and sat beside him , feet dangling , one toe making ripples . Careful that the moon pin should n't prick , she brought his head close to her breast and took fistfuls of his hair and commenced gently tugging it . To keep the scalp limber , she insisted ; no bald heads among the Vedrenya menfolk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their scalps ever since he and Holland were youngsters . " And the rat ? How did it die ? " " I . . . I do n't know . " How could he tell her of Holland'scruelty . " It was one of Russell 's pets . Maybe it was the heat . " " I see . Tch . Poor creature . I hope the rabbit wo n't miss it too much . Fancy a rabbit mother to a rat . " " I think they were a happy family at least . " " Meaning ? " " Well , our family  --  " He groped to express himself . " Is not happy ? " " Not that . But families should be thick . " " Yes , of course . Like soup . " The Other 47 " But ours is broth , " he said with a droll look . " Why does Mother like clover so much ? It 's just a weed , is n't it ? " " Clover is one of our most common wildflowers ; it is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story of the clover , surely . It was your mother 's wedding bouquet . " Yes , she knew he 'd heard the story , a favorite of the family , especially with Torrie , the new bride ; but to hear it now would avoid further talk of rats and funerals and death . So she told it again , how there was the World War and Father , stationed at Fort Dix , and Zan , his mother , had decided hastily to marry before he sailed . How Uncle George and Aunt Valeria were present and how at the last minute Aunt Vee had rememberedthere was no bouquet for the bride and had hopped a fence into a nearby field where she picked the clover . " And stepped in cowflops , " he was quick to remind her . " Yes . In the cowflops , if you must have them . And so , " she finished , " your dear mother is charmed her life long by clover . And you , you are planning some flower arrangements yourself ? " " No 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed to a pile of stilldrippingcattails lying close by on the riverbank . " Cattails , " he said ; another innocent gaze . She was used to his little strategies . " Yes , I know they are cattails , young man . And what will you do with them , these cattails ? " " Oh  --  nothing , " he said evasively , in the manner of thirteenyear-oldboys . " They 're just for  --  nothing . " She took his chin in her hand to plumb him with eyes ancient and humorous and wise , her expression thoughtful , half smile , half frown . " Well ? " she said , waiting with her sibyl look , and he looked away , feeling transparent , knowing she knew he lied. 48 The OtherWith certain evasions he explained about Doc Savage and the Winter Kingdom of the Akaluks . A fantastic imagination , she thought , brushing her fingers against his cheek . " What 's a hermaphrodite ? " Niles asked . " A hermaphrodite is supposedly a creature half man , half woman , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more mythological , half Hermes , half Aphrodite , do you see . Why ? " He explained about the Firemen 's Carnival and the Maltese freak . " How 're your hands ? " he asked , watching her gingerly press her swollen fingers . She dismissed the subject with a wave . Never had he heard her complain about the pain that nagged her joints . For her amusement he reached into his shirt and extracted his pet on its silver chain , laying it between them in the sun . " That chameleon will perish inside there , " she told him , thinking how continually enchanting she found him . " He can breathe okay . I like the way he tickles . And he 's not a chameleon , he 's a basilisk . See  --  he has a diamond for an eye . Do n't dare look at it or you 'll turn to stone . " " Ah , a lizard Medusa , no less . " Such whimsy . What to do with the boy ? But where had he learned of basilisks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maidens , those water creatureshidden there in the depths , his secret that he had pledged her to keep . She shook her head and drew wet moss over the flowers in her basket : sunflowers , black-eyed Susans , devil 's paintbrush , spotted lilies , and buttercups . Taking one of the latter he held it under her chin . Yes , she liked butter . But her favorites were the sunflowers . He lifted one up and blew at it , dispersing a little cloud of powder into the air . " Yah , here all the sunflowers get dust . " But it was pleasant to see them all the same . They reminded her of St. Petersburg , The Other 49where the wind sweeping across the Russian plain kept them fresh and dust-free . " Is it really true that sunflowers follow the sun all day ? " he asked . She had read this to him from a book . " I think it is only superstition . But all Russians are superstitious , you know . See ? " She took his cheeks between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face to the sun . " Sunflower ! " he shouted , grinning proudly and squinting against the light . She let her eyes rest upon his face for a moment ; ah , the freshness of his features , the flower-soft skin with the golden fuzz below the hairline . This was her podsolnechnik , her sunflower now ; gone were all the sunflowersof Russia , but in their place grew this one , this prize flower of her heart . " Why are you smiling ? " " Ach , " she said , " I was remembering that day we played the game on the sunflowers , and you cry because of that damn crow . My douschka , such a crybaby you were . " " Was not , " he protested , pulling away . " It 's all right . Everyone should cry sometimes . It 's good for the digestive tract . Yah . When your uncle gets home , shall you come with me to take the flowers down ? " He paled , looked at her blankly . Uncle George ? Home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice shaky , a sick feeling in the stomach . " To the cemetery . When Uncle George comes with the car , Winnie shall drive us and we shall put decorations out . We go in secret and say nothing so your mother shall not be upset , yes ? " He stole a look to the barn and Russell 's form in the hatch . Wait till my Dad gets home ! " Yes , all right . I 'll come with you . " He took a deep breath , expelling it slowly , carefully , 50 The Other that she should not see his fear . Oh the secrets he must guard . . . " How is it you do not caddy for Uncle George today ? " Reprieve ! He 'd forgotten Uncle George was golfing after work . If he played the second nine out he would n't get home until seven , and he always stopped for a drink at the nine- teenth hole . Niles 's look aroused her suspicions . She gave him another piercing stare . " Yes ? Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't caddy for Uncle George any more . Why ? Well , this morning he 'd been barred from the golf club . Why ? Well , he and Holland had gotten up early and had taken the trolley car ( riding on the back of the cowcatcher no doubt , she surmised ) out to the second nine fairway looking for yesterday 's lost golf balls and the greens- keeper had caught Niles and now he was barred . " And we had to give him all the golf balls we found . Almost two bucks worth . Gripes ! " " Niles , " she chided . Grabbing up a handy stick , a diversionary tactic , he dropped to one knee and sprayed her with lead . " Rat-tat-tat- tat-tat ! " Machine-gunning her , sweeping the stick about in an arc . " You 're dead . You 're Dillinger and you 're dead ! You 're Mad Dog Coll and you 're dead ! Dead dead dead ! " " Stop that this instant , " she ordered . " Throw that stick away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The idea . Where do you children learn about such things ? Mad Dog Coll indeed ! " Beware of mad dogs lurking , for lurking , they shall bite . " And biting  --  " She was half muttering to her- self , but he knew what she meant . " Well , you 're supposed to fall down when you 're killed , " he informed her . Dejected , he shoved his hands in his pockets . Gosh , when the Feds got Dillinger last year in front of that theater , he sure fell down dead . Think of getting lead poisoning because you took in a movie , for cripes sakes . Clark Gable  --  ick ! " Do n't frown so , child . " He looked up at her . " Ada ? " " Yah ? " " How can you always tell ? " " Tell what ? " " About what 's true and what is n't . How do you always know ? " " I do not always . " She looked down at him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He frowned . " Well , " he said gravely , " sometimes I do . " He stretched to her ear , asking conspiratorially behind his hand , " Can we do it now ? " She smiled , showing the strong white teeth which were still hers . This was their game , of course , and accordingly she rose and , moving from the landing , drew him with her , holding him slightly to one side , his head a little lower than her shoulder , pointing out a dragonfly darting at the patch of goldenrod . He looked up at her with questioning eyes . " No , look there . Look at the darning needle . Look hard . " The insect hovered above a frond and he stared silently , intently , for a long time , his gaze transfixed . Sun waves shimmeredand even from a distance he became gradually aware of the harsh weedy scent . Now the dragonfly darted once more , hovered , darted again , all at once soaring aloft , now diving , now hanging suspended . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes from it . In time he felt her light touch . " What is it like ? " she asked , a kind of expectation in her voice . " What does it feel like ? " " Airplanes . It feels like airplanes . " Ah , she thought , airplanes  --  rather perceptive . It was something of that nature , though not a machine , awhat ? Creature , he supposed . Carefully he examined the long-52 The Other ness of it , the slenderness , the  --  airiness . Lighter than air , and as thin ; segmented body , metallic wings veined with silver and gold , iridescent like fairy-tale wings , inaudibly humming , beat- ing faster than eye can see .

Delicate , ferocious little beast , swifter than a swallow , flushing insect game from the clover preserves , devouring , devouring , devour- ingNow the dragonfly wafted high into the air and Niles felt his own being lifting away from the earth , felt his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the creature , compound eyes raking in , grasping , everything ; to the west along the pastures running to meet the Avalon ridge across the river , and dimly in the distance , the Shadow Hills blanketed in haze . Away to the cast , beyond the house , over billowy green treetops , down to a cluster of roofs and spires : the Center . At his own backdoor he saw into the kitchen garden , saw Winnie the hired girl taking in the laundry , saw the trolley car running the Shadow Hills route , up from Talcotts Ferry , up past Knobb Street and past Packard Lane , out through the city on the north , and on to Babylon to the west ; Babylon , End of the Line . It lay all before him , like a miniature playtown , the houses diminished , the barn a toy , the people on the sidewalk only make-believe . Saw , down there on the ground , Ada , standing alone , a speck . All this he described for her in precise detail . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ardent and breathless from his flight . She agreed ; it must be all of that , surely . And between them they savored like forbidden fruit the secret of the game . He smiled . " Did I do it good ? " " Yes , child . " " Good as Holland ? " Beneath the moon pin the delicate lace at her throat was trembling in the breeze , the smile elusive . " Ach , " she said at last , and her voice was pained , " as good as Holland . As good as me , as any . " Shading her face with the parasol , as though to obscure her feelings , she peered out across the river . " Another , " he begged , tugging eagerly at her arm , but she only smiled and said , " That is enough for today "  --  which is also the way with grandmothers . " Pajalsta , just one more ? " She raised her basket . " I must gather some watercress to bring to Winnie for salad tonight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to be put off . " Pajalsta , pajalsta ? " He was irresistible . She tousled his hair and scanned the field , moving the parasol against the sun . " What shall it be ? " Her eyes roved from object to object : a red-winged blackbird flitting on a twig , a dilapidated fence post , a rusting oil drum , a worn-out tire . " There , " she said at last , " look there . Tell me what you see . " He followed her eyes up the meadow to where Mr. Angelini continued his haying . " But , " he protested , " it 's too far . I ca n't  --  " " Look , " she insisted . " Do as I have taught you . Concentrate . Tell me what it is like . " Compelled , he looked . Perceived bright plumes wafting through the sunlight , the hay sailing in yellow forkfuls against the sky .

Now , distracted , his eye followed the path of the pitchforkthrough the air as it reversed itself , completing its movement , the curving tines , their tips like sharp fingers , beckoning the sun , waiting to catch it , glinting like cold fire  --  stabbing-a pain  --  ohh  --  S4 The Other " Niles , what is it ? " He was clutching his chest , fingers stiffly arched , his face contorted . He hunched over , his breath coming in short gasps . " Ada  --  it hurts  --  " " What , child ? " She bent in alarm , trying to examine him , enfolding him till the pain subsided . Racked , he shuddered , held himself very still . Then he looked up at her , gray eyes wide , wondering at the strangeness of the pain . " It 's gone , " he said in time , his breath coming irregularly . He managed a smile . She felt his forehead , his chest . " Niles , what was it ? Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mysterious path of the pain . Was it his heart ? No  --  the span of his fingers told her the pain sprang across the width of his chest . " Tell me what it was like . " " I ca n't . It was just  --  a pain  --  all sharp , pointy , here . " He touched his chest again . " But it 's gone . It 's all right , Ada , honest . " Butting his head against her , he nuzzled his face in one delicate hand while her fingers caressed the golden pelt growing along the nape of his neck . Unabashed , he said simply , " I love you . " Her heart leapt . " Ach , douschka , I love you too . " He picked up his rod . " I 'm going down the river a ways and see if I can get some pickerel . " " Perhaps , " she suggested before he went , " Russell might like to go fishing too . Surely there must be more fishing poles somewhere . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care for Russell very much , do you ?

The Other SSAnd when Aunt Josie and Aunt Fanuschka come , Russell must move into your room  --  " His puckish laugh cut her off as he ran through the marsh grass into the field , where he quickly gathered a bunch of goldenrod , returning to lay it in her basket with the other flowers .

She had opened her mouth to commend his artlessness until his next words made her start . " Holland wo n't like it though , " he said darkly , and when she replied her voice was sharper than she intended . " Why , how 's that ? " Gripes , he did n't want to get Holland in dutch . He shook his head and obstinately said , " He 's just not going to , that 's all . " " Stop making faces , child , and tell me why . " " Because he is n't . Because  --  because he does n't like Russell . That 's what it was , with the rat . That 's why there was a funeral . " Abruptly , as if she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landing . By chance a cloud passed across the sun , gray , with a gold edge , like a huge doily , casting a mournful shadow . A sudden breeze scalloped the surface of the water . She shivered. 56 The Other " Are you cold ? " She shook her head . " Nyet . A crow was walking on my grave , is all . " A crow . The crow 's name was Holland . He knew what she was thinking , how worried she was about him , how she tried never to show it , tried not to let on that she knew things .. . she 'd have guessed , anyway , he bet , eventually , about the rat . And he was supposed to go on protecting Holland , covering for him , keeping his secrets , the ring , the packet , the blue packet which contained The Thing . He sighed .

She watched him go , tugging his khaki shorts rolled above tawny thighs , his shoulder blades protruding at the back of his gay shirt like incipient wings , the halo of tow hair which topped the slender neck flashing in the sun . Then he was lost behind the screen of willows , and , her eyes lingering on the spot where he had disappeared , it came to her mind that he was not a human at all , not her grandchild , Holland 's twin , but instead some wild woodland thing , a faun perhaps , carrying a fishing pole in place of pipes . How was it that she felt chilly ? She lay back against the boards of the landing and let the sun-drenched wood warm her bones . She hated the cold .

When the sun had dropped further , when she had gathered her watercress from a nearby spring , and squeezed out the hem of her dress , she slipped back into the canvas shoes . They were very comfortable , with the X 's cut into the tops to let her corns breathe . But it was not only the corns which gave her trouble . One leg , badly mangled by a dog when she was much younger , still gave her pain sometimes , causing her to limp slightly . Suddenly she was startled by a movement in the grass . She laughed to herself .

Up at the barn Russell stood in the loft door fanning his face , his glasses glinting in the sun . Mr. Angelini was no longer in view . Ach . Ada shook her head again , thinking about her own cat  --  Pilakea . Pilakea was a word Holland had collected from somewhere ; " trouble , " it meant , in Hawaiian . Trouble indeed . But of course there was n't any more Pilakea ; that one had come to a bad end , back in March , right after St. Patrick 's Day . On Holland 's birthday .

She remembered the way they58 The Other reacted to " doing the game " ; this almost mystic " transference " she had discovered as a girl and taught them . So different , Niles a child of the air , a joyous spirit , well disposed , warm , affec- tionate , his nature in his face ; tender , merry , loving , Holland ? Something else again .

Holland a Pisces , fish-slippery , now one thing , now another . Niles an Aries , a ram blithely butting at obstacles . Growing side by side , but somehow not together . Strange . Time and again Holland would retreat , Niles pursue , Holland withdraw again , reticent , taciturn , a snail in its shell . It had n't always been so . As twins should , they had been inseparable to begin with . Why , they had shared the same cradle , head to foot  --  that old wicker cradle , still in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they slept in the same crib . You would have thought they were Siamese twins , so close they were ; one being housed in two forms . What had happened ? Whose fault ? She could not tell . Always the same question , over and over . . . Yes , for Holland she could weep . " Why , Niles would give that boy the shirt off his back . " I expect he would . It is his nature . Generous to a fault , that was Niles . Half the things given him had found their way into Holland 's possession . Give each a tin soldier , Holland would end up with a pair ; some cars , Holland would have a fleet . And a sorcerer when it came to money . Niles  --  born with the caul , naturally he was lucky with money  --  found a dollar bill tucked between the pages of Granddaddy 's Bible , a piece of old-fashioned Civil War currency . Finders keepers , Vining had said ; but turn around and Holland had the money , squirreledaway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had found it later , dusting . And Holland 's nature ? There was the day , for instance , when he was sent home from school . " I 'm sorry , " informed Miss Weeks , the Principal , seated stiffly in the parlor , " we 're all sorry , really , Niles is such a good pupil ; however , Holland  --  " She turned red . " But what has he done ? " " Holland is a disturbing influence . . . " " How ? What do you mean exactly , a disturbing influence ? " Her stringent , tight-lipped report was more than disturbing : shocking . " Nonsense ! " They denied the stories . But the facts werethere . " Perhaps a psychologist  --  " Miss Weeks had suggested . So , Dr. Daniels : " High-spirited boy . Boisterous , but with no defects , unless an excess of spirits . Not unnatural in young boys . Keep him busy . Lots of exercise . " But there was more to it : stormy , fretful , surrendering himself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rash , sulky , proud by turns . " Holland , " she would say to the scowling imp-face he put on , " you can catch a lot more flies with sugar than you can with vinegar . Holland , smile  --  you do n't want your face to freeze that way . " And in time the6o The Othersmile would come , reluctantly at first , then dazzlingly ; afterward , an extravagance of affection . Dear Holland , she could weep . She lowered her head and her hand moved past her face as though to brush away , like a cobweb , some painful memory , then , raising her eyes again , she stood motionless for some moments , her parasol tilted against the sun , her figure oddly turned , held as though awaiting some event while the breeze rippled the slight fabric of her parasol , causing it to shudder . And up in the barn , moving from the open door , out of the sunshine , stepping back into the shadow of the loft and once more laying his glasses down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four long steps to the edge of the loft . Arms flung wide , he leaped . " I 'm the King of the Mountain ! " Down and down and down . Hardly soaring , but dropping merely , the smell of fresh-cut hay in his nose , holding his breath and dropping into the cool dark nothingness , rushing as though late for an appointment , hurrying to where , only a blur at first , then more clearly , clearer than anything he had ever seen , astonishingly clear , reaching for him with cruel beckoning fingers , waiting to catch him as he fell , he saw in the blackness the glinting silver prongs , sharp , sharp , and fire-cold . . . " Eeeyaiee ! " As the steel tore through his chest , shattering flesh and bone , his scream sent the mice scurrying with fright , and hot blood , all red and frothy , with little ruffles like ghastly lace , spurted into the yellow hay , and in another moment Winnie and Mr. Angelini had come running from the pump , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ada stood , her body rigid , her head slightly averted , listening as the cry reached her ears , with it , on the breeze , the lazy thrum of a harmonica , while the fingers of her trembling hand pressed ever more fiercely against the sharp points of the golden crescent moon pinned at her breast . The Other 6tVRussell Perry is in the parlor , in his coffin , open to view . It is from the parlor that the Perrys have always been buried . In the parlor they are christened , are betrothed , are married ; dead , in the parlor they are laid out . It has always been so : the shades drawn , the casket on black-draped trestles looped with cords and tassels ; sighing , whispery , shadowlike forms slipping in silently to mourn , to regret or  --  secretly , as some will  --  to savor , laying warm lips against cold unyielding flesh in last farewell . This is the Perrys ' way . There are sprays of gladioli and a pair of Sheffield candelabra , one to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling in the late morning light . Mr. Tuthill , a dull , eulogizing man , stands to one side , while seated to the left of the casket , in folding chairs from the undertaker 's , are the family ; opposite , a few others : Dr. Brainard and wife , and Simon and Laurenza Pennyfeather , friends from farther up Valley Hill Road . While the minister speaks of how often they have gathered in the parlor for this same sad purpose , Niles stares at Holland , spruce in his blue suit and white collar , wearing one of his father 's ties , his hair neatly combed , shoes shined , standing just behind Ada 's left shoulder and looking straight ahead , inexpressive gray eyes fastened on nothing. 62 The OtherBeyond him sits Winnie Koslowsky , behind her , Leno Angelini , the once-handsome immigrant , still hardy and manly , but bandy-legged and bowed , with brooding eyes , complexion the color and texture of old leather , his columnar neck corded , his hands sinewy , the iron-gray mustache below his long , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been the first to reach Russell , with Winnie close behind , she having been cleaning radishes at the pump , he washing up and in a hurry to get hone when the scream was heard . They found Russell still moving in the hay , writhing with pain , and trying to pull from his chest the pitchfork which had gone clean through him and out the back , and when Leno had yanked it free , the blood came pumping out with the boy 's heartbeat in a pulsing red tide . A shocking accident . With one curious sidelight : Mr. Angelini was always so careful about his tools . He was sure , swore , in fact , that he had hung the pitchfork back in its accustomed place in the tool shed right after he stabled the team . By stretching his neck slightly , Niles could see past his sister Torrie and her husband Rider Gannon to Uncle George and Aunt Valeria . Poor Aunt Vee  --  what a transformation  --  overnight from chipper chickie to sad sparrow . You had to feel sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for having let Russell play where it was unsafe , where children ought not to be allowed . Uncle George had given strict orders : no more jumping in the hay ; had given Mr. Angelini a padlock to put on the Slave Door . But it was too late now . Niles looked at his grandmother . She was sitting in her black dress , the gold moon pin on her breast , hands folded quietly in her lap , her head making faint , almost imperceptible nods , and her eyes resting , not on the minister , nor even on the open coffin , but on the painting beyond . It was as though she were trying to solve some enigma hidden in the faces of theThe Other 63three subjects : her daughter Alexandra , striking-looking in a long black dress , her figure slim , elegant , against the gray stripes of a chairback , a large amethyst-colored flower held negligently in a hand . Hair piled like a smoky cloud on a finely shaped head , a long curving neck , a captivating smile , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , a boat in the crook of his arm , Niles on the other with a stuffed animal , their features uncannily similar , all three gazing out of the gilt frame , sharing some undisclosed but amusing secret . Mother and Her Boys , the family called the picture . It made her ache to look at it . Speaking of her sister-in-law , Valeria used to say , " Just a bit theatrical looking , do n't you think ? Seems absolutely stalked by tragedy . Something about the eyes , I expect . Deep  --  terribly deep . Haunted , actually . " Aunt Vee always selected her words as she might fruit , squeezing each for ripeness and juiciness . But an apt description : Alexandra leading her secluded existence , remaining upstairs for many a mournful month , sitting up there in the chintz-covered chair reading books brought her from the library ; unwilling , unable , to come down . The minister 's monotone unabated , Niles 's mind wandered farther afield , in time abandoning altogether his cousin 's funeral while his thoughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at the photographs in an album : the corners tidily stuck down , the images preserved and captioned , a bit of dust on one , another slightly faded . Mentally he thumbed the pages , pausing to review familiar scenes . At the Pump : Holland and Niles , naked , in the pool under the spout . The pool filled , their broken images doubled in the water , duplicated precisely as jacks on a playing card . In one moment of sheer delight , bursting with unreserved joy , their arms reach out to each other , hands clasp in a mirthful flash . Their connection seems not only physical , but spiritual as64 The Otherwell . Each smiling , each expressing a deeper delight in his human reflection , there is evidence of a profound sort of union . Father records the moment with his Kodak . The Pony Cart : Holland and Niles , grinning crookedly from a wicker cart with skinny red wheels ; the pony 's name is Donald . Father leads him along the drive . Father wears a crewingsweater and smokes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a man , stronger than Atlas , wiser than Solomon ( richer than Croesus , alas no ) , more virtuous than Galahad , his eyes alight with humor , a tolerant smile on his mouth . Father , A Man Much Admired . Ile can do everything  --  well , practically . Anyway , Niles thinks so . At the Pictures : An enormous movie cavern . Silvery giants leaping on the screen . Niles goes for a drink ; returning he becomeslost ; cries . Holland comes , takes his hand , leads him to his seat . The Riverboat : Holland and Niles are standing on a sandbar in the middle of the river . The last of the paddlewheelers goes by . The pilot waves . He smokes a corncob pipe . As the boat passes , a marvelous thing happens : Niles discovers money ! He finds , half-sunken in the sand , a silver dollar . Niles Discovers Money  --  Part Two : Leafing through Granddaddy Perry 's Bible , he comes across a large green bill . Civil War currency , Father explains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holland . Later , conniving . Money ends up in Holland 's pocket , thence to a hiding place , thence , discovered , to the bank account . Niles  --  rooked again . The Poverty Party : Saturday night , a baked-bean supper on trestle tables set up in the barn . Holland and Niles hidden overhead in the loft , watching the country club crowd getting drunk on the gin Father stirred up in the set-tubs . Everyone costumed and dancing on the threshing floor . Great fun untilThe Other 65Niles laughs too loud at Father 's outrageous garb and they are banished to bed . Then , The Apple Cellar : Saturday morning , last November . Holland is above on the threshing floor , steadying the baskets for Mr. Angelini and Father , who carry them down the stairladderwhere Niles waits with the lamp . Mr. Angelini goes up the ladder , Father starts down through the trapdoor with another basket . Holland 's legs may be glimpsed through the opening . With Father halfway down , the door starts falling ... falling . . . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door raised , Holland rushing down . Taking his twin out through the Slave Door into the wagon room . . . When Niles sees Father again , he is lying there , where Russell lies now . . . before the fireplace . . . a casket . . . a quilted bed of silk ... drawn shades . . . flowers and candles . . . the lower body hidden by the closed part of the lid . Niles looks down at the face on the pillow , hears the same minister , repeating those same words .. . "  --  forever and ever , Amen . " In unison the mourners , led by Mr. Tuthill , were finishing the Lord 's Prayer ; in another moment Russell Perry 's service was concluded . Next , the drive to the cemetery behind the church , where Mr. Tuthill would read  --  inevitably  --  the Twenty-third Psalm and commend Russell'sspirit to Life Everlasting . Then would come the last part , the burial , the sexton 's shovel tossing back the dirt into the hole . But for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  noted Holland 's expression , dreamy and far away , that same moonstruck look , his eyes obscured by a filmy glaze . Beads of perspiration lay across his upper lip , moist and slightly parted from the lower . What was he thinking ? Certainly it was not a worried or perplexed expression : now his thoughts were not on the ring in the tobacco tin  --  or the blue tissue packet. 66 The OtherNo , clearly , he was not worrying . His face , both dim and vacant , was inscrutable , with that curiously Asiatic cast to it . To jolt him from his reverie , Niles found it required a vigorous nod on his part , and he jerked a hand up in an abrupt flashing gesture to indicate the way past the casket , while Ada , clasping her pocketbook in her black-gloved fingers , caught the movement over her shoulder and revealed her disquiet as the last of the mourners filed from the parlor . Upstairs in her room , Alexandra 's slippered feet nervously paced the flower-patterned rug , gliding to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dressing table , pausing before a mahogany pier glass , then continuing back and forth across the rug until , at the sound of an approaching motor in the driveway , they returned to the door , where they contrived to linger . In time she opened the door a crack . A step sounded along the hall . She threw her arms wide and drew Niles into the room . " Hello , Mother . " She was quite tall and he had to stretch to reach her mouth . " Is it all over ? " She dropped into the chintz-covered chair , while he , taking the dressing table stool , watched her wan face , easily detecting the strain . She was wearing her cologne , a fresh , flowery fragrance he liked , but one that failed to mask the other smell , though she kept her scented handkerchief close to her mouth . Over . Yes , it was over . Russell was buried and Aunt Valeria was shut in her room , unable to stop crying . Niles was struck by the clarity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark center of his mother 's eye ; how easily he recognized the pain there . Like the lens of a camera , stopped down to a single vivid image , this gleaming iris doggedly focused forThe Other 67him the picture of Russell Perry 's round body tumbling out of the loft , down onto the cold steel jutting in the haymow . Her eye was flitting again , coming to rest periodically on the drawer of her dressing table , while he toyed with the silver handles of her vanity set . Arranged around the brushes , nail buffer , and button hook were silver-framed photographs : Niles and Holland under the pump ; the family bathing at the seashore ; Ada wearing moire and a fashionable string of pearls ; Holland and Niles again , sailor-suited in the pony cart ; Torrie in her wedding gown ; the poverty partygoers with Mother wearing Father 's tuxedo and Father in Mother 's red dress and his old rubber fishing boots . " I guesss the aunts wo n't be coming now . " He had picked up a snapshot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of a tennis net : Ada 's sisters , the great-aunts , Josie and Fania . " Yes they will . They thought they might not come because of the  --  situation  --  but I insist , I insist , we 're not going to have any more long faces around here , and they are to arrive as planned . Though I think they want to postpone until after the middle of next month . A suitable waiting period , they feel . " He beamed . " Then there 's lots of time . " " For what , darling ? " " For the show ! " he exclaimed gaily , an effort to perk herup . Each year , while the aunts were visiting , there would be ashow in the barn , all proceeds to charity . Lantern slides andcolored postcards projected on a sheet , Charlie Chaplin silentsand Aunt Jo performing " Yes , We Have No Bananas " or " Do n't Bring Lulu " ; afterward , her Betty Boop or Mae West . Then , piece de resistance , magicking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stooging for him in the audience . " And Chan Yu 's coming again , " he added , recalling for her68 The Otherthe Fourth of July Firemen 's Carnival and the magician who last year had performed an amazing trick : had seemingly hanged himself , but at the last minute the cloth covering him had dropped , the noose was revealed as empty , and presto ! there was Chan Yu in the aisle , alive and smiling ! Chan Yu the Disappearing Marvel . Viewing the remarkable performance , Holland and Niles had played their game , concentrating to discover the secret . " And ? " prompted Alexandra , who had forgotten , " what was it ? " Niles described again the way it had been accomplished , how they had solved the mystery of the hanging . " Yes . Yes , dear . That will be nice , I 'm sure . Your tricks ... always wonderful ... " Shc was drifting off . Placing her book in her hands , he rose . " There . Finish The Good Earth so you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dear . Thank you . Be sure to change your clothes . " He pressed her hand and bent to lay a cheek against hers and exchange kisses . To forestall him , she pressed her handkerchief to her lips ; turned her head away ; shammed a cough . Oh Mother , poor dear Mother , he thought . 1 know . What could he do for her ? How could he help her ? What could he say that would free those thoughts imprisoned inside her head , those unspoken things he knew she would never say . He looked down at her tiny slippers , pretty things Father had brought from Gibraltar , those and a tortoise-shell comb too , when he came back from overseas . And a monkey of carved coral  --  they ran wild in troops all over the Rock , he said  --  which she wore when she got dressed up . Such pains she took : never went farther than the corner without stockings . Always , before taking the trolley car upstreet , selecting her costume with care , gloves and bag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of veiling in front . When she passed , heads turned , all nods andsmiles and friendly inclinings . " Oh that Alexandra Perry , " he would hear people say , " she 's got a gleam in her eye . " It was true . She had a rainbow laugh , and displayed it liberally for her family . " Mother ? " he said lightly . She made a garbled , half-sound in her throat , and shook her head . " Nothing , dear . " She tried to laugh . Again her eyes skidded ; in the afternoon light her face shone pale and incandescent . She fidgeted with her robe , started to get up , then , changing her mind , leaned back as though the effort were too much . Her look went unobserved by him as he kissed her again , feeling the veins in her wrists beat when he leaned to squeeze them a final time . " Bye , Mother . I 'll be back later . " " Yes , darling , of course . Please do . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aunt Vee 's sake , please ? " Languidly she kissed her fingertips away . When he had gone , she rose and drifted about the room at length , clasping and unclasping her hands , pressing them to her temples as if she would seal in certain broodings which lay hidden there . In time she returned to the dressing table where , from under the scarves in the left-hand drawer , she drew forth a bottle . Pouring some cool water from the carafe thoughtfully provided by Winnie , she added the whisky and , resuming her chair , once again let her eyes roam toward the lavender patch of clover by the well . At the rear of the house the Perry roof had difficulty encompassing both a north and south wing as each rambled patchwork-like in its haphazard additions : dark passages , unexpectedturnings , oddly located stairways , and eccentric , surprising spaces . One of these , over the kitchen with its own back stairway , was a pleasant and sunny bedroom . Once it70 The Other had been the " invalid room " set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aunt ( " mad as a hatter , Old Aunt Hattie " ) whom the family had wished to care for themselves , rather than entrust her to an institution . Cheerful with yellow paint and white trim , the place was known now simply as " the boys ' room . " More sleeping porch than bedroom , it had two matching beds with spool-turned posts ; at the foot of each , wooden chests , carpentered by Father , identical except for the " H " on one , the " N " on the other . Overhead , tissue-and- balsa airplane models ; and spilling over shelves an array of boys ' miscellany : lead soldiers , rock crystals and schists , a stack of trolley transfers , a stamp collection , jumbled books , a world globe , a fold-down desk with picture scrolls  --  the kind known as a Chautauqua desk  --  hanging on the wall . Added touches both humorous and bizarre : a sun-bleached hawk 's head , a red bicycle reflector stuck in one cyesocket ; a plaster bust with antlers attached ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a turkey wishbone . To the north the windows over- looked the other wing ; south , out along the drive ; west , past the barn , down to the icehouse at the river . Niles undid his tie , removed his jacket and pants , and hung them up . He took his shoes off , undoing the laces thoughtfully , some unintelligible dismay jarring his consciousness . What was it ? A picture had formed in his mind ; at the center it remained blank , a space he was unable to fill . Something to do with Russell . It bothered him . He threw the lid of his chest back : neatly folded underwear , socks , all with name tapes Ada had sewn on ; belts and moccasins , a sweater , some shirts freshly laundered by Winnie . He put one on  --  his favorite  --  buttoned it and tucked it in . Seated on the chest at the foot of Holland 's bed , he emptied out the Prince Albert can into his lap and one by one returned the items inside , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Peregrine for Perry , the blue tissue paper packet , this last  --  The Thing  --  of an intriguing shape , approximately two inches long , narrow , only slightly thicker than a pencil , and the paper , well worn by frequent undoings , a bright robin 's egg blue . He dropped the can with its contents inside his shirt , went to stab his finger at a word in the dictionary , and left the room . The shocked gloomy aftermath of death pressed a heavy hand upon the house . In the hallways the shades were pulled , the darkened staircase sprawled into a shadowy limbo . Lugubriouscrying cane from behind Aunt Valeria 's door . Downstairsthe bell rang ; Niles , pausing on the top landing , glimpsed a face beyond the screen : Mrs. Rowe from next door . Ada would go to answer ; she would be there to see to all the formalities . A man in black , a flower in his lapel , tiptoed across the hall carrying folding chairs to a second , similarly dressed man : Mr. Foley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trestles , the funeral draperies . It was all so forlorn , so sad , so empty ; such a feeling of finality to these events . A termination . The End . Born 192 i  --  Died 1935 . Poor Russell . Mr. Foley , speaking to his assistant . What was that he was saying ? What ? Holland  --  ? Niles 's ears buzzed ; he could feel his face flush ; was forced to restrain himself from running downstairs , shutting up Mr. Foley  --  big-mouthed Mr. Foley , like the Fish Footman in Alice in Wonderland . Shut up , Mr. Foley . . . The grandfather clock at the head of the stairs was a perverse timepiece : tock-tick , it insisted upon , tock-tick . Todayit sounded pervasive and excessively loud , making the silent house seem more dolorous than ever . Standing stockstill , Niles listened and watched , measuring the silence . From the hall closet beside the clock he took a wooden72 The Other milking stool and opened the door of the clockcase : the weights were unwound almost to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed to run down . It had accompanied Ada and Grandpapa Vedrenya to America and for years had stood in the hall of their house in . Baltimore . When Ada came to Pequot Landing the clock came too . Niles drew down the chains , pulling the brass weights upward , still thinking of Russell in the hayloft . He touched the weights to stop their swaying , set the pendulum in motion , and closed the door . He stood on the stool and , using a rigidly extended finger , moved forward the minute hand to coincide with the one on his watch . It had been an accident . In his rush to get home that afternoon , Mr. Angelini had left his pitchfork in the hay . And Russell must have taken off his glasses and  --  wait a minute  --  there it was , the missing blank : Russell 's glasses . That was why he had n't seen the pitchfork ; he had taken his glasses off . And , strangely , no one had been able to discover what had become of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ada had noticed them shining ; but they were n't in the loft and they were n't in the hay . Afterward , the mow being thoroughly searched , the hunt failed to turn them up , and Mr. Blessing , the town constable , investigating the accident , had declared it a puzzling thing . It was . " Slow , huh ? " Unmistakably Holland , the throaty timbre , the slightly mocking tone . Leaning indolently against the newel post , twirling Father 's necktie in one hand , still wearing his Sunday suit . To Niles 's " You forgot to wind it , " he re- plied , " No , little brother , your turn last week . " Niles returned the stool to the closet ; closed the door . Warped , it refused to shut all the way and he pressed his back against it , trying to get the latch to click . " You forget sometimes ; it 's not good to let the clock run down , " he told . /JHolland , " it 's very old . Old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a prissy face and , miming an aged person with a cane , recited , " Who touches a hair of yon gray head dies like a dog  --  march on , he said . ' Okay , Barbara Fritchie . " He laughed and blew on his harmonica . " Gripes  --  cut that out ! " Niles looked askance at the breach of decorum ; quickly Holland adopted a sober expression . " Jeeze , " he whispered , " I 'm sorry  --  I forgot . " His contrition was unavailing , for in a second George Perry 's red face appeared at the door , crew-cut hair , gray and spiky like a sea urchin , eyes pale and haggard . " Hey , pipe down out here , ca n't you ? " he whispered urgently ; Niles thought Holland looked ( and properly so ) sheepish as he shoved his instrument behind his back and , chastened , scuffed a toe at the carpet . Appropriate apologies were made , the door closed again and , over Uncle George 's helpless pleading came the louder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't . Chickie ? Please do n't cry any more . Try , can you  --  for me  --  for Russell ? Please ? " " Who touches a hair of that yon gray head , " Holland breathed , joking as he stole along the gallery and listened at the door . " Aunt Vee 's going away . " " She is ? To a hospital ? " Niles came to stand beside him . " No , she 's going on a trip . I heard Mr. Tuthill say the change would ease her . " " I guess it would . She 's very unhappy . " He wondered what might be done to cheer her up . Not much , he supposed ; when people died , people cried a lot ; but that 's what death seemed to be , always crying , hurting , remembering . . . Niles went to the hall window and raised the shade , feeling the sun stream through the lace curtain . " I 've got a word for you , " he said ; saw Holland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Asinine . ' " " Ass-inine . " Holland chortled . " Sounds dirty . " Niles 's look was superior . " Means stupid ' or silly . ' Like a jackass . " " Where 'd you hear it ? " " Mother . " Holland remained pointedly silent , and Niles , looking across the street , thought how much the leaves on the Joacums ' sassafras tree resembled mittens , his eye somehow unable to avoid the shed at the back of the house where Holland had bundled up the oily rags and started the fire . The clapboarding was still burned black . Sassafras mittens , three- , four- , five- fingered leaves . Sassafras alhidum , according to the Chautauqua roll . Up in the topmost branches , the arrow  --  his arrow ; no , Holland 's , really . But what matter ? The bows were gone . Under the tree  --  not that one , the horse-chestnut tree behind the house , Father had daubed a target . Their birthdays , three years ago ; bow-and-arrow presents . Holland 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in bright stripes , the feathers hawk , not hen . His lucky arrow , he declares . A volley at the target . " Wait , guys , let me show you . " Father helps them gather up the scattered arrows , patiently shows them proper stance and how to knuckle the shaft with one hand , guide it with the other . " I hit it  --  I hit it ! " Niles pulls his arrow from a ring ; Holland scowling blackly at his own wild shots . Mother from the kitchen : " Dear , telephone  --  the insurance office . " Father goes in while fresh fusillades pepper the target . " Jeeze ! " Holland 's arrows continue to miss . Nocking the last to his string , the color-banded one , he watches while Niles , on tiptoe at the tree , reaches to pull out his shafts . Thwang ! From Holland 's bow flies the arrow , wobbling through the air ; turning , Niles catches it in the throat . " Accident ! " Holland swears after Dr. Brainard has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Father orders . Enraged , Holland dashes out , sends the arrow flying across the street into the topmost tip of the sassafras tree . And there it is , still , three years later . And since then ? Since the arrow , Holland has somehow ceased caring . Now , more and more , the mocking smile , the Mother Goose rhyme . . . Holland had a Secret , Niles was sure . Er-roo-aroo-a-ro o-o-o ! His train of thought was broken by an aged banty rooster who came pecking hopefully at the gravel down the drive , lifting his legs high off the ground as he strutted along . Hollandstuck his head out the window and softly called , " Chanticleer . " Ignoring the voice , the bird made husky half-crowing noises in its throat and continued on its way . " Chanticleer ! " Holland leaned out , lightly repeating the name and Niles distinctly caught his oblique look , at once quizzical and amused , making a critical study of him , looking from boy to bird and back to boy , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end he only smiled his lazy crooked smile and shook his head , implying his thoughts were of small consequence . For an instant their looks fused , then Holland shrugged and , his expressionunfathomable , left him , went away to change his clothes . And , holding his breath for the longest time , Niles , his eye again on the rooster , remarked to himself how the stale , faintly scorched odor of Winnie 's last ironing still clung about the yellowing folds of the lace curtain. 76 The Other The Other 77Jac , Niles , the storeroom was the most glamorous room in the house . Tucked away in the north wing , adjoining Torrie and Rider 's bedroom , it was a dusty and cobwebbed museum crammed to overflowing with sheet-draped trunks , boxes of clothing , oddments of costumes and uniforms . Near the door was the twins ' wicker cradle , beyond it a dress dummy , a wheelchair , a gilt and painted rocking horse , a tangled marionettedangling on the mirror door of a wardrobe ; old friends , all . Straddling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its neck , rocking while the Victrola  --  Granddaddy Perry 's antique machine with the morning glory horn  --  sounded the crashing chords of Siegfried 's Rhine Journey . From the corner of his eye he caught a shadow as it fell across the floor . Quickly he sat up to discover a figure standing in the half-open doorway , watching him . " I have been everywhere looking for you , " Ada said . She had changed her black things for a house dress and tidied her hair . " I might have known you come in here . Are you having a Rainy Day ? " " No . Yes . Sort of . I was listening . " " Ah  --  Das Rheingold . " She came and looked down at him , her brow furrowed . " Are you all right , douschka ? " " Sure .

" But maybe he do n't want to be alone today . Maybe it would be nice for you to ride with him . Besides , you like to see the trains , do n't you ? " " Yes . Sometimes . But not just now . " He looked steadily at the gouged flooring under his feet . " If Holland comes back , maybe he could go . " He could feel her eye intent upon him . " Has Holland gone away then ? " He sighed . Supposed so . Did n't know where , though . Had he sneaked down to the cave he frequented at Talcotts Ferry ? Or down to the freight station to watch the trains ? Up to Knobb Street where the tough gang lived ? Was he hanging around at the Pilgrim Drugstore ? Or had he gone off riding the trolley cars on the Shadow Hills route , a trip out to Babylon , the end of the line ? He went to roll up the wheelchair for her to sit in , a sturdy , ugly thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Guiding it to a spot opposite the rocking horse , ignoring her set expression , he gently took her hands and tried to press her into the chair ( why did she resist him ? ) , where she might sit comfortably . " Guess what ? The clock was slow . I wound it . It was practically run down . " " Indeed . Someone forgot , did they ? " " Well , you know how he gets mixed up . " " Who ? " " Holland . It was his turn . " She put his hands from her , lightly and in no way reprov-78 The Otheringly , and in another moment went to lift the window curtain . He came to stand beside her , looking down at the lawn , the pump , the well close by the grove of firs at the edge of the drive . The way she held the curtain aside , it was as though she exhibited for his perusal a landscape : sky , grass , river , trees , a cow or two . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and up along the fields on the farthest side , up to the Avalon ridge , beyond , even , across some vast untraveled space , and he could tell she had gone farther yet , even to that farthest point , that faraway place where no one might accompany her , beyond the ridge , beyond the Shadow Hills , to a place where she was alone , aloof , a solitary , pondering  --  what ? witch , perhaps ? no , somcthing grander , a goddess , he thought  --  Minerva , all serene , imperturbable , benign , sprung full-blown from Jove 's brow . Again the record ended ; he turned it over and wound the machine . Following introductory scratchings came the rich sonorous notes of a soprano . Ho-yo-to-ho  --  Briinnhilde 's battle cry . " Yah , " said Ada at last , turning from the window , " Die Walkiire . " When he had led her back to the chair and gravely seated her , she said , " Niles , do n't you think sometimes you blame Holland for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe , but it was his turn . Well , it was , honest to  --  " " Niles . " " Gosh . " He grinned back at her look . " I remember , do n't I , when it 's my turn ? " " Is that so much to be proud of ? " " No . " He turned this over . " Pride goeth before a fall  --  ' " " Pride goeth before destruction and a haughty spirit before a fall . ' " " Have I a haughty spirit ? " His query , coming after furtherThe Other 79consideration , as though acknowledging the possibility , made her laugh . " Gracious no . " She smoothed his hair down and kissed it . She reached for the marionette hanging on the wardrobe door : poor tangled king with its cardboard crown , costumed by her from scraps of velvet and lame left over from a dress Zan had made for herself , and a saturnine face painted by Holland , the eyes not quite straight : King Cophetua . And where , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beggar-maid he loved ? Niles dug out a hatbox , rummaged , produced a raggedy , woebegonefigure , tried to make her bow at the waist , and laughed when she slipped through his fingers to drop into a broken heap in the corner . " What did you say ? " he said , returning to her and the marionette dangling before her . " How 's that ? Did I say something ? Why , I must have been talking to myself , must n't I ? That is a sure sign of age , I expect . " " You 're only as young as you feel , that 's what Mr. Pennyfeathersays . " A smile , both spontaneous and disarming , broke across his face briefly , then dimmed , clouds before sun . " I went in to see Mother . " " Yah , I looked for you there . " " She 's nervous today . " " I know . " " I guess it 's because of the funeral and all . " " I am glad everyone remembered to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She shook her head . " That poor soul , he is being made to suffer so for his carelessness . We must remember to try to smile him up so he does not feel quite so guilty . Accidents will happen . " " That 's what Holland said . Is Aunt Valeria really going away ? " 8o The Other The Other 81 " Yes . For a visit . She has a friend in Chicago , one she went to school with . " " That 'll be good . Does n't she have folks ? " " No , dear . Mr. Russell and his wife went down on the Titanic over twenty years ago . " He had forgotten . That was why Granddaddy Perry had generously arranged for them to be married in Pequot Landing , right downstairs in the parlor with the minister saying the do-you 's in front of the fireplace and the stair banister garlandedby Grandmother Perry with laurel and apple blossom . " Aunt Vee 's very unhappy , is n't she ? " Niles said after a while . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm going down to the Center and buy her a present to smile her up . " He paused to review the available merchandise . " Do you think she might like some Mexican jumping beans ? " Ada hid her amusement . " I do n't see why not . I imagine jumping beans might be very cheerful . And shall you please ask at Miss Josceline 's if the tube of crimson lake I ordered has come in ? I should like to do a painting of the roses before they go by . " " Yes 'm . " The music ended and he got up to change the record again . In a moment the high tenor voice of John McCormack filled the room . " Is n't that The Minstrel Boy ' ? " she asked . " I have n't heard it in years . It used to be a favorite of Daddy Perry 's , I remember . " Bemused , she hummed a snatch of the Irish air ; " Strange , how one forgets the words . " " Ada ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bri nnhilde ride into the fire ? " " My , what made you think of that , the Wagner music ? Why , in those days , that is what the women did . It was called immolation . They offered themselves on the pyre of the be-loved . " " Yes , but why ? " " For love , I imagine . When one 's love of the beloved is greater than one 's love of life or of one 's self , one sometimes prefers death . It is not so much an immolation of the body , I think , of one 's physical being as  --  " she paused to select her words . " What , then ? " " As an immolation of the heart . " He thought this over , then : " Was that Mrs. Rowe at the door before ? " " Why , yes . Was n't that nice of her , she come to bring us a dish over . " Their nearest neighbor , Mrs. Rowe , was an elderly widow who lived with a housekeeper-companion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What did she cook ? " " A meatloaf . Now none of your icks , young man , meatloafis perfectly nice . And it was thoughtful of her to bother . She do n't have to do things like that . " Niles winced : sometimes she sounded so dreadfully " old country . " " Yah , " " Yas , " " dat damn bird . " She handed him the marionette , the strings freed at last . " There ; there 's your King Cophetua , good as new . " She rose and looked at the figure on the floor . " Alas for his beggar maid . Will you stay and listen to some more music or come along with me ? I 'm going to visit a while with your mother before supper . " He blinked up at her , eyes troubled . " What is it , Ada ? What 's wrong with Mother ? Sometimes she seems fine , just like she used to be . Then she gets  --  " he shrugged a child 's bewilderment  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And she82 The Otherca n't remember things . She asked if the ashes were taken out and the furnace has n't been on since April . " " The record , child , " she said , nodding at the Victrola , where the end of the disk scraped under the needle . He got up and put the arm back to the beginning again . " You must be patient with your mother , " she told him . " She will be all right again , in time  --  please God "  --  here she made a cross of her thumb and forefinger in the Russian way and kissed it fervently  --  " she has had a shock . I-Icr mind  --  her mind wants to protect itself against pain . And sometimes it takes longer for some people to get over things than others , do you see . " " Yes . " Though from his tone it was not clear if he did or did not . " Also , you Must remember that your mother does not rest well . Often she walks the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all ; the light shows under the door until dawn . And this is very bad , because sleep is a most holy thing .

" It is like a deep pool , this imagination , and during the day it gets used up , like water , and when we sleep at night the water we have used during the day gets replaced . And if it is not replaced , if there is none to drink of , we are thirsty . It is front sleep that God gives us our strength and our power and our peace , do you see . " He nodded , impressed by the gravity of her speech . Not to sleep , he decided , must be a very bad thing . " I wish I could help , " he murmured , with a turn to the Victrola handle . " We help one another by understanding one another : that is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . " " Hope . " He took this in , turned it over , accepted and , like so much of the rest of the product of her mind , stored it . Listening to the song , he wandered far away , across someThe Other 83darkened landscape where another mocked him and fire failed to warm his body . Out loud he added a final word to all that had preceded . She turned swiftly and gaped at him . " How 's that , child ? Death , you say ? " " Yes , it 's death , " he repeated decidedly , " it 's death that Mother ca n't get over . " Dancing the marionette along in the air , he walked back to the window . " That must be awful . Do you think Father felt any pain when he died ? " " We do not know . Hopefully he did not . " " Yes . Hopefully .

" " Felt pain . I mean , falling on a pitchfork , that must really be painful , do n't you think ? " " Yes , surely . " Another thought . She faced him again . " Niles . " " Yes 'm . " " Do I imagine to have been hearing a harmonica ? " He laughed . " No , you hear it . That 's Holland . He plays itsometimes . " He did not say how he had just made him quit , how it upset Uncle George . " Where did Holland get the harmonica ? " " Oh  --  from a friend . " " Who is this friend ? " " Just a friend . " " And this  --  friend  --  gave it to Holland ? " " No . " Reluctantly . See ? See how she can tell when he 's lying ? " Then ? " " Well , the friend did n't exactly give it to him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  --  crooked it from him . Or , well , it was n't exactly a him , ' it was a her , ' and it was n't a friend , it was  --  " " Yah ? " " Miss Josceline-Marie . " " Shoplifting ? Oh ! " she exclaimed in exasperation . " I did not raise any boys to become thieves . " Standing at the sill , where the marionette lay , a tiny corpse , she observed a bleak , protracted silence , seeming to have shrunk further within herself , her eyes closed , lost in thought , apparently not at all aware of the tenor voice singing again the old Irish melody . Nor , leaving the room with a look , did she in any way acknowledge the words : The min-strel bo-oy to the wars is gone , In the ranks of dea-a-ath you 'll find him .. . Now there : that 's what he meant . Something was bothering her , though she tried to keep it hidden . Something on her mind . A faintly puzzled air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It had to do with Holland , he felt certain . All these looks going around : Mother sorrowful ( Aunt Vee , ditto ) ; Uncle George , helpless ; Winnie tearful ; Holland , mysterious ; even Mr. Angelini ( looking , Niles thought , sort of like a tribal elder , his dark brows lowered  --  how long the hairs in his eyebrowswere  --  his look hardly ever leaving the back of Holland 's head as Mr. Tuthill droned on about blasted buds on the family tree ) . And now Ada . But you never could tell , with Ada . Her looks were often the strangest of all . Russians , being happy , the happiness oozed out of every pore ; it was all around them , like the sun . Unhappiness was hidden , as though it did n't exist . Well , of course she was unhappy about Russell'sThe Other 85getting killed on the pitchfork ( no sense in hiding that ) . Everyone was unhappy ; Holland too . Holland . . . And what , Niles asked himself again , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loft ? Alone , humming along with the Minstrel Boy song , Niles looked down to see his hand again drawn , as though by some other , some magnetizing , outside force , to his shirtfront , where it crept inside and removed the tobacco tin . He regarded the face of Prince Albert thoughtfully ( even he had a Look today ! ) , then unsnapped the lid , raised it , and drew forth the packet of worn blue paper . He unfolded the layers of wrapping  --  how like the crumpled petals of a rose they were , a blue paper rose  --  opening it oh-so-gently , that he might not tear the paper further ; and for a long time he stared down at its contents , The Thing , The Thing given to him by Holland , that which lay there at the center of the corolla-like layers of tissue , that Thing of shriveled flesh and bone and cartilage that was a severed human finger .

I 'm actually feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Imagine , standing in line for what they throw at you down in the cafeteria ! ) Later on I wo n't be able to sleep at all . Never do . If I sleep , I dream .

I 'm going to be sure to ask Miss DeGroot about that when she comes . ( She should have started her rounds by now . ) I 've been wondering what place it is she thinks it looks like . Maybe it is n't an island after all ; maybe it 's a country . It does look a little like Spain and Portugal together , do n't you think ? If you turn your head this way ? The whole Iberian peninsula ? If you use your imagination a little . Even though Miss DeGroot is PennsylvaniaDutch  --  big hands , big feet , big nose , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suppose if she looked long enough at that spot she 'd probably see it as the Abominable Snowman or something . I think imagination 's a healthy thing . Makes so much more possible to one , does n't it ? I know ; you 're probably saying Holland never had that sort of imagination ; but you 're wrong . He had imagination all right . Lots of it . It is n't all Niles , you know . Not by a long shot . Do not imagine I am predisposed in his favor as a simple matter of course ; if you think this , then I have led you up the garden path . Given your druthers , which of the pair would you prefer ? 90 The OtherI am more inclined to identify with Holland ; his stamp seems , to me , to be the less counterfeit . My predilection for the underdog , no doubt , and every underdog shall have his day , to coin a phrase . Believe me , Niles is not entirely the paragon he appears , nor Holland quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me , by far the more engrossing ; that is to say , endearing . Their ways are winning indeed , but who is unwilling to be won by such charm ? Consider : I have described for you a Niles warm , sympathetic , innocent , virtuous , a little droll  --  fine , to a point  --  a child possessed of a certain , clear sentience , and certainly a most genuine one . On the other hand , the picture painted of Holland is nearly villainous : aloof , independent , mocking , a cold , wintry boy , and as we have only a moment ago seen , a thief . But here a question arises : why then does Niles engage in such emulation ? Such imitation ? Why wear his sibling 's shoes ? Wonder at his whereabouts ? Miss him ? Why lie , not on his own bed , but on his brother 's , staring at that face , up there in the plaster , the watermark face , like this one here , in this room ? Ah , you may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who then are I-lolland 's friends ? The Knobb Street gang ? The older boys whistling at the girls outside the Pilgrim Drugstore up at Packard Lane ? Do not believe it . Why does Niles watch Holland off to ride the streetcars ? And , more to the point , why does he not ride , himself ? And , what , I wonder , is the particular significance he attaches to those streetcars as they rattle past the house , the house that was pulled down even beforethe advent of the buses on the Shadow Hills route ? Discoveringthis would , I think , unravel much of the mystery . Niles is generous , you say . Agreed . But what of the gifts he has received from Holland ? The ring , the blue packet ? Admit it  --  taken by and large , Holland is an entrancing charTheOther 91acter . Surely he is . And that smile  --  nonpareil ; who could stay mad at him for long ? Not Niles , assuredly , whose smile is no less celestial , and Niles , who knows his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death . See if he does n't . You have perhaps observed , as I have , how the Hollands of this world are sometimes moved by a depth of passion unlikely to be found in the average child of like age . How their hatreds seem scarcely less ingrained than those to be found in the more mature personality . Yes , you say , you have heard of that shocking business behind the schoolhouse with the little girl , but who of us has not engaged in such frivolous investigations ; moreover , the girl was older than he and should have known better . And if Holland did burn down a shack , who was hurt ? Not much harm was done , and Ed Joacum was known to have been insurance-poor . As for that much-talked-about business concerning the Talcott boy , assuredly Holland was there ( he himself admitted it ) and assuredly the boy did drown , but one ought to discredit  --  asI have always been inclined to do  --  any oblique allusions to the accident , except for the fact of the boy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holland 's discriminate and sensitive nature must have seemed monstrous enough . He detested the ugly and the grotesque , I will admit ; though , for him , as for most of us , it exerted a certain macabre fascination . Which brings me to the Firemen 's Fourth of July Carnival , grotesque enough in some of its aspects , and which , in a manner of speaking , is a beginning  --  this at a time when Russell had been buried for several weeks and already most of the family 's thoughts of the death had faded into an increasingly dim past. 92 The OtherOh  --  I should mention that there was at that time a new girl in town . She boarded with some people on Church Street and worked at the Ten Cent Store , demonstrating the latest song hits on an upright piano . She was called Rose Halligan but , though she had only been in Pequot Landing a few months , the boys already had a sobriquet for her .. . I " Hey Roundheels ! " Dressed in a tight skirt and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chest , Rose Halligan ogled the cars on the Ferris wheel . Star-pricked with lights , the contraptionturned fitfully , dipping couples out of the dusk and ladling them high into the air . A loudspeaker braying " On the Isle of Capri " vied with the tinny mechanical clatter of the merry-go-round calliope and the electric splat of ladycrackers and cherry bombs . At the series of hot whistles greeting her from one of thecars , Rose wiggled a shoulder in disdain , tossed her head , andlooked away . Rose Halligan did n't mess with the young fry . With a wink to Holland , Niles waved , called " Woo-woo , " while the ground rose in a flat plane and quickly receded . " Carmen Lombardo sings through his nose , " he remarked ofthe music while the car jerked spasmodically , moved , stopped , moved again , then all at once lurched to the topmost position of the wheel , others below dropping to disgorge their loadsand board new ones . He looked down at the crowd millingabout the postage-stamp lot where a small , tawdry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pequot Landing Fire Department thrills and excitementfor one night only . On either side of a narrow avenue carpeted94 The Otherwith a debris of strewn popcorn and crumpled Dixie cups , booths , shabby , faded , limp , furnished third-rate amusement : Win-a-Doll ; Madame Zora , Stargazer ; Chan Yu the DisappearingMarvel ; Zuleika , the World 's Only True Half Man-Half Woman . Bang ! Whoosh ! Somewhere a rocket exploded ; now and then a Roman candle showered gorgeous rain-light on a lawn ; a child sliced crazy zigzags out of the night with a Fourth of July sparkler . The wheel creaking , Niles put his head back and took in the expanse of black sky . " That 's Gemini , " he said , picking out a constellation . " You 're crazy , " Holland told him . " Sure it is  --  see ? That 's Taurus there , and that 's Cancer over there , and right there , between those two bright little stars , that 's Castor , the yellowish one , and Pollux . The Twins . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the wheel to move again , began rocking the car and while Niles continued his survey of the sky  --  over there was Ursa Major , and see that seedlike cluster ? Cassiopeia 's Chair  --  the thrum of the harmonicamade a pleasant accompaniment to the moment . " Holland ? " Niles said , when the music stopped . " Mmm ? " " What did you call Mrs. Rowe ? " " Hm ? " " What did you call Mrs. Rowe that day  --  when she found you in her garage ? " Holland chuckled ; repeated some words that shocked even Niles . " Did you , honest ? What 'd she do ? " " I told you , she chased me home . " This time his chuckle was a little more than wry , a little less than savage . " But just wait . " The Other 95 " Wait for what ? " " Wait till Old Lady Rowe gets it . " And Niles noted how , as Holland made the remark , the flushed exuberance of his face evened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his narrowed eyes thoughtfully examining some privatephantom . Niles considered his profile against the dark sky : Holland , he thought ; Holland . He needed him  --  they needed each other . That was the thing . He was  --  what ?  --  dependent on him . Without Holland , he felt some unidentifiable part of him had been lost . " Look ! There 's Arnie La Fever . " Niles pointed down at the ground . " And look  --  that 's Torrie ! " Arms about each other 's waists , Torrie and Rider stood at the Win-a-Doll booth , beguiled by the spinning wheel . Torrie was not really a Perry at all . After three childless years , Alexandraand Vining had found a four-year-old to adopt ; twelve months later the twins arrived . Everyone liked Torrie . Her pixyish features were in direct contrast to the Perrys ' , who had always managed somehow to look regal . ( Grandmother Perry was given to Queen Maryish toques and carried a walking stick before they took her away . ) More petite , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and brown eyes and lots of freckles . Gamine , as the French would say , charmingand gay and lighthearted , with both spirit and humor , determined to make Rider Gannon a good wife . Eight months pregnant , she was showing rather full , though Dr. Brainard expected her to go full term . Rider laid two coins on numbered squares , and the operator spun the wheel again . The leather flap , clacking in and out of the wheel 's perimeter , gradually slowed . Niles , perched on high , could see that Torrie had n't won . She stood for a long moment , yearning at the row of prizes ranged behind the96 The Other counter while Rider generously dug again in his pocket . She shook her head and drew him away from the booth  --  and temptation  --  and back into the crowd . " Too bad , " Niles said glumly , thinking how , with her awk- ward flat-footed gait , Torrie walked like a penguin carrying a watermelon . " But she 's going to have a pretty baby . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple . " Is she ? " he said mysteriously , and the Ferris wheel began to turn . When at last it had completed its prescribed number of revolutions , ending the ride , Niles ran down the ramp and pressed through the throng behind Holland . Someone jostled him : Arnie La Fever , whose fat and limp features evoked a picture of Russell Perry , his face shoved into a bobbin of spun candy ; bits of the stuff came away on Niles 's arm , looking like some unnatural fungus growth . He touched his arm , felt the sticky confection dissolve , leaving an uncomfortable residue glistening like snail tracks on his bare skin . He sucked his fin- gers and wiped them on a handkerchief . " Hi , Arnie , " he called , but Arnie had disappeared in the crowd . You did n't see him much ; mostly he was sick and his mother kept him out of school . " Try yer luck ? " the man at the Win-a-Doll booth was calling , " tin cints is all it takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollic fer yer girlie . " Niles inspected the dolls : funny- looking things , they had round brown kewpie-doll faces garishly painted with idiotic , implike expressions  --  more leer than smile , a row of cheap duplicate countenances attesting to the inept workmanship of some would-be artisan . Below the waist was a full skirt of peach-colored fabric , forming a lamp- shade , with an electric cord running underneath . To demon- strate , the man stuck the plug in a socket and the doll lit up , the skirt glowing a warm orange . " Here we go folks here we go , " he cried , banging on the counter of numbered squares , " ev-ree-body try yer luck . " He zipped the wheel and as several onlookers chanced their money , Niles laid a dime on number i o . His eyeballs spiraling in their sockets , he tried to follow the blurred path of the numbers on the revolving wheel . Eventually he could make out his numeral ; it slowed and stopped on the opposite side ; again he tried ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempt , when the wheel had almost stopped , the pointer crawled into the 5 sprocket , then , at the very last , as if by magic , pushed its way into number 4 . " There y'are , kiddo , " the man said , handing him his prize . Niles carried the lamp over to Holland , who stood eyeing the proceedings from the shadow of a dilapidated tent . Gripes  --  the Look . " Jeeze , what d' you want that for ? " he said . " I won it for Torrie . " Niles held it up , arranged the skirt . " Took you forty cents to get it . " Holland reached and turned the doll upside down . " Nothing , " he said , looking up under the dress . " Who wants a sissy doll , anyways . " Niles took the lamp and watched his twin as he walked over to the entrance of the tent where a poster displayed the picture of a yellow-faced , mustachioed Chinese , his hands hidden in his sleeves , his body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' n gennamin , " a voice bawled , " las ' chance t'night t'see Chan Yu , the Disappearing Marvel . Twenny fi ' cents t'see the Disappearing Marvel Chan Yu , hurryhurryhurry , show 's just beginning  --  " In the darkness of the tent people had gathered in front of a small stage hung with velvet curtains ; from somewhere at the rear issued the scratchy sounds of a phonograph record : an Oriental dissonance of cymbal , bell , and flute . On stage , a spotlightfell upon a large , highly lacquered red cabinet , and on98 The OtherChan Yu the Disappearing Marvel , standing beside it . Slanteyedand trying hard to look exotic , wearing long black mustachesand a little cap with a pigtail , he was grandly bowing to thin applause . Producing an ivory-tipped wand , he rapped with it against the cabinet , simultaneously slipping a concealed latch and opening the front panel . Inside was a duplicate cabinet , slightly smaller and lacquered green , which he displayed with flashy magician 's gestures . He turned the box , rapping again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black , and finally a fifth , gold . Hands folded across his chest , the magician stepped back into the cabinet . After a short pause , during which the needle was raked across the record as an invisible hand restarted the music , a girl glided onstage in kimono and stiff black wig . Chan Yu , his eyes closed , a red light making a weird mask of his impassive features , his makeup and mustaches obvious fakes , appeared to be dead . The assistant closed the panel ; there was a click and she rotated the cabinet ; next , the black panel shut , the box turned again  --  blue , green , red . The music increased in volume and in the dim light the audience waited , hushed and expectant . Niles looked at Holland for a moment , then whispered , " Let 's try it . " " What ? " " The game . Let 's do it  --  see if we can figure the secret . " Satisfied that Holland was concentrating , Niles began mentally examining the nest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the mystery of it , the truth ? The magician seems to be in the cabinet  --  that 's the appearance of it ; but he is n't , at least not for long , that 's the reality . Boxes ; shiny , smooth , lacquered surfaces , brass-banded , escutcheoned . Incense , some exotic fragrance . A box within a box within a box . Another and another . Gold , black , blue , green , red . A nest . A riddle . A trap ? The Other 99Let 's see . Hold your breath inside the box , in the dark ; wait for the moment . Cymbals and bells and flutes flourishing to mask the noise of a wire being tripped , while below a trap is sprung . Now drop flat in the dirt beneath , roll from under the stage , behind the tent , strip off the mustaches and pigtail , fling away the cap and robe . In their place a suit of black paper , shoes , hat , everything paper : a Chinese funeral suit . Out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front , mingling in the audience . Chan Yu the Disappearing Marvel . Again the light , the music doused , the girl assistant clicking the latches , smiling as she opens the panels , each in turn , all the boxes empty , one after another ; cries of astonishment and applause as Chan Yu is discovered lounging casually among the onlookers : he lifts his hat and bows . Hurray , Chan Yu ! Lights up to full signaled the end of the show and the audience chattered their way from the tent . Outside , Niles took a deep breath and , nodding with a professional air , said , " So that 's how he does it . " Holland was silent and looked at the ground . " Right ? " Niles prodded . After a while , a grudging " Yes , " but Niles could see the way it was  --  Holland turned away , his expression hostile , eyes sullen . They exchanged a long look , then Holland stepped out of the bright swarm of papery moths and walked away , leaving a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cymbals , the whisper of a flute floating in his ears . A light wind chased a flurry of soiled rubbish end over end along the patchy ground , flapping tent canvas as it went . The hum of the crowd seemed far removed . In the darkened space between two tents , like the deserted alley off a main thoroughfare , two figures huddled : Rose Halligan , the piano player from the Ten Cent Store , and a man Niles recognized as the operator of the Ferris wheel , both lolling against a guy rope , too The Other The Other l o this neck hunched , his hands working at her , fumbling at the buttons of her red blouse , running across her front , eagerly meeting her own frantic fingers . Niles could hear her low amused laugh as he moved away . He overtook Holland at the freak show tent , where , under faded , gaudy posters shrieking of meretricious and unbelievablesights to be discovered inside  --  " Sexational  --  Shocking  --  Seductive "  --  amuffin-faced man , cigar butt plugging the corner of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his spiel . " Laze ' n gennamin , stip right up ! See the Wonder Pig , Bobo the Wonder Pig , five feet , not four but five , the fifth foot right where it does the most good , see the great colossalheadedbaby , before your very eyes , Nature 's mistake , the hideous horrible hydrocephalic monster ! Watch Mister and Missus Katz , the Arkansas Little Folk , lovers even as you and I ! Marvel at Zuleika , the Maltese morphadite , she has somethin ' for everyone , laze ' n gennamin , a gen-u-wine morphadite , half-man half-lady , shows you the works , real sexy ! " Swiveling his cigar to the other side of his mouth , he poked a cane and said , " Beat it , pretty boy , you ai n't old enough fer this here show . You Boy Scouts keep yer minds above yer belts and none of this here sort of stuff . " After a brief and obscene pantomime , he commenced his spiel again . " Stip right up , laze and gennamin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man 's back . With a grin , Niles followed him as he ducked out of the mothinfestedlight . Through an alley between two tents . At the rear , the chrome gleam of a pocket knife ; a slit in the canvas panel . Down on all fours . Inside , the air was smoky and stale ; on the trampled sod gobbets of hawked spit glistened . Several feet directly ahead was the back of a platform , hung with grommeted canvas curtains on a wire forming a three-sided cubicle with one wall open . From within camethe sound of a child speaking . Holding his breath , Niles moved cautiously in the direction of the voice . " Stomach settled any , Stanley ? " it was inquiring solicitously . " Eh , " came the disgusted reply . " All that drugstore stuff 's no good , for Chrise sakes , Exlax , Feenamint , Milka Magnesia . I 'm tellin ' ya , Stan  --  what yew need 's a good enema . " Peering over Holland 's shoulder around the side of the cubicle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Mrs. Katz , the Arkansas Little Folk . They sat in dolls ' chairs with dolls ' china laid out on a doll 's table . Oblivious of their surroundings , they behaved as though enjoying their own privacy , he plainly bored , staring straight ahead , blinking and sighing , she daintily applying a tomato shade of polish to her baby nails , pausing now and then to blow . " Hot water and soap suds enema , that 's what ya really need , " Mrs. Katz prescribed in an ocarina voice . " Shoot a mile , Tennessee , " Mr. Katz said . Niles pictured him " assuming the position " with the rubber hose stuck up his rear and Mrs. Katz holding the red rubber bag in one hand while with the other she whipped the soapsuds to a froth . " Ya shoulda come to the pitchers this afternoon , Stanley , " she said enthusiastically . " I tole ya yew 'd of liked it . " " Whadja see ? " he cheeped , bird-like . " Gold Diggers of 1935 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was this one number , musta been a hunnert girls , all in white dresses and they 's all playing on fiddles , ever ' one of ' em . " " Christ , a hundred girls dressed in white playing fiddles and there 's people starving in Tuleopa . " " Yeah , Stan , but that 's what folks want . It 's pure excapism , that 's all . Who wants t'see people starving in the movies  --  youroe The Other The Other 1o3can see that on the street any day . That 's why folks want to excape , see ? " " Shoot a mile , Tennessee , " Stanley replied dolefully . Close by Holland 's side , Niles mingled with the spectators , feeling safe from discovery as the sweating , shirt-sleeved forms of the adults hemmed them in . Bored with the midgets , the group shortly passed along to gawk at a man whose face , grotesque and seamed with livid scar tissue , had no nose , and who rasped pathetically as he puffed a cigarette through a metal lens-like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoke in a cloud through the hole where his nose should have been . Next there was Bobo , the five-legged pig , an anomaly which failed to produce much interest from Holland , who merely eyed it , coldly , as if he thought it should perform tricks as well . As for Niles , the animal 's freakish anatomy caused him to think of Arnie 's father , Mr. La Fever , who was with the circus , and something of an anomaly himself , for if he did n't have five limbs he was at least tri-legged . At the end of the tent the group stopped to stare at a sagging platform where , seated beneath a fringed and beaded lampshade , another attraction presented itself : Zuleika , the Maltese Hermaphrodite  --  a bizarre and epicene creature whose eyes , dark and wet and slightly popped , were penciled around in some black substance , with a pile of carefully dressed hair curled in black ringlets glossy with brilliantine . The hairless , flaccid body was draped in a sleazy kimono whose copperysheen glinted like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers which toyed seductively with moist , rouged lips . The half-parted robe revealed one hand closing and opening rhythmically upon a quasi-developed breast , the nippleof which was startlingly large and scarlet-colored . Ontiptoe beside Holland , gaping , Niles watched while the creature , with a pleased smile , covered the breast , closed the robe and fastidiously re-tied the sash . He  --  or was it a she ?  --  changed position slightly and opened the skirt of the robe , teasingly , a little at a time , playing with the onlookers , rolling the eyes heavenwards , displaying finally a dark V of wiry hair wedged between plump , womanish thighs . It must be a lady , then . Niles looked for confirmation from Holland , and was struck by his scornful expression , the eyebrowsfractionally raised , the corners of the mouth lifted in scant contempt . Thighs spread , and with an arch smile , the creature reached with exquisite fingers to extract from the patch of hair a small white fleshy growth which , like an elastic band , was stretched several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smirk marking her superiority over the curious spectators , she tucked the nub of flesh from sight and , disdainfully closing the robe , crossed her knees , signaling , apparently , an end of the exhibition . When she had arranged her features into a bored mask and reached to extinguish the light , Niles got the impressionit was a man  --  or boy , anyway  --  but certainly not a woman ; in the dark he ?  --  she ? lit a cigarette , the flame illuminating for an instant the black eyes which glittered jewel-like , the languidlylowered lids heavy with a greasy film . Inexplicably , Niles felt a sudden wave of pity melting through him ; poor , poor freak . He glanced at Holland , whose eyes , narrow , flat , opaque , stared back at the creature in disdain . Another surge : the crowd swept along close to the entrance , stopping before a rickety oilcloth-covered table . On it sat a large glass laboratory jar , filled with a clear , viscouslookingliquid ; in it , hideously floating , its skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organs , features all formed in de-104 The Other tailed miniature , was a male human infant . Strands of hair wav- ing gently in the preservative grew from a skull swollen to more than twice its normal size , the shiny skin stretching taut across it , the astonished eyes wide and milk-glazed like those of a dead fish , rubbery lips gaping as if the thing had drowned or been strangled in the middle of a scream . The crowd , thrilled by the grisly horror , rubbernecked for a while , pushing and jostling for a closer look . Then , laughing or shivering according to their natures , they gradually filed from the tent . Turning from the repulsive sight , feeling his stomach rise and drop , Niles unconsciously fingered his shirt for the tobacco tin . " Holland  --  " he began , then blinked , ap- palled by the look of fascination on the other 's face . " Changeling , " Holland whispered hoarsely , tapping the glass . " What ? " " Little changeling child . " His tapping of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fro , rising and falling ; rising again , head back , pale puckered lips breaking the surface as though gasping for breath . " Little baby , " he taunted bitterly , " pretty little baby . " He turned to Niles . " That 's what Torrie 's is going to look like , just like that . Wo n't that be nice ? " Niles was dumfounded . " No  --  no , it wo n't . It 'll be beauti- ful  --  " " Will it ? " Holland chuckled wickedly . " If you think so , wait and see . " And he went away , laughing , into the darkness . " Hey you ! " the barker cried as Niles , hurrying to catchup , appeared at the entrance . Clutching his doll-lamp , heturned and ran in the opposite direction , fumbling for the slitat the rear of the tent . In another moment he had slippedthrough the canvas , leaving behind only a frayed and gapinghole . Back in the dim light leaking through from the entrance , The Other 105on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat the glass laboratory jar , its tiny specimen still bobbing in thc solution , the blank marble eyes dead , staring , the mouth pink and toothless , open in its silent scream . IIIn a chair on the veranda , Ada rocked in the soft light comingfrom inside the house and fingered the coverlet she had been binding with careful stitches . Her hands , the joints red and swollen , were seldom idle ; there was always something : beans to snap , fruit to preserve , socks to knit , a scrap quilt , a coverlet to sew ; day in , day out , till year 's end . And begin again . It was the way she 'd been taught . But now it was too dark to work any longer , and she rocked to the strains of music from the parlor while dusk fell about her . At a sound she lifted her wrinkled lids . Niles crossed the lawn , his shoes making slick , whispering sibilances on the wet grass . Inside , at the top of the stairs , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd be up . " He blinked at her in the light lying in square patterns about her feet . " Mrs. Rowe did n't take her flag down , " he observed , handing her a paper cup of ice cream . " Poor thing , she is forgetful . Patriotic but forgetful , " sheio6 The Other said , taking the cup and the small wooden spoon . " Ah , you knew . " Eagerly she lifted the cover from the half-melted con- tents , peeled away the circle of opaque paper on the back and peered at the picture . " Who shall it be ? Oh , I like Anne Shirley ! I 'll just put her in my collection , shall I ? Yah and strawberry , too . My favorite . Spasiva , douschka . How was the fair ? " " Carnival , " he corrected , and took the time to describe for her the Ferris wheel , the fireworks , the crowd . " And I won this for Torrie . It 's a hood-war lamp . " " A doll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face . " " And two midgets , " he went on , laughing about the im- pending enema . And Zuleika , the hermaphrodite , and the magician . " What was he like ? " " A Chink  --  I mean Chinaman , sort of , " he said and told her about Chan Yu 's trick . " And he ended up in a paper suit like they wear for funerals . " " Oriental thrift , " she replied with a wry twist . " And I know how he did the trick . " He told her how he 'd discovered the method by concentrating on the nest of lacquered boxes . " Holland could n't feel what it was like . " Well , she knew about that anyway ; it was seldom he and Holland saw things the same . " And there was a pig , " he went on , " a five-legged pig . " " What was that like , I wonder ? " He chortled . " I thought it was like Mr. La Fever . " She acknowledged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she ate the ice cream . Through the open window came the soft saxophone sounds of a dance orchestra over the Atwater- Kent radio . Waltz Time , that would be ; Abe Lyman 's band . " Do you want to hear First Nigh ter tonight ? " " Is that next ? " " Uh-huh . " From his position on the step he could just see over the sill into the parlor . The curtains were pulled aside to let the breeze in and his eye drifted to Mother and Her Boys , smiling down from over the mantel . That was where Aunt Vee and Uncle George had gotten married , right there in the parlor . He recalled Torrie 's tale  --  no one else in the family ever mentioned it  --  about how Aunt Vee had come down the stairs in her bridal gown to stand before the wedding guests at the fireplace . And how , halfway through the service , GrandmotherPerry had sprung from her chair with a cry to tear the veil from Aunt Vee 's head ; how she had clawed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had cried out again when they came to take her away . Finished with her ice cream , Ada laid the Dixie cup and spoon aside , wiping off the cardboard lid on her handkerchief and placing it in her sewing basket . How peaceful it was , sitting there in the quiet night . Partially screened by the branches of the elms , the moon etched into the steel-dark plate of grass fine silvery cross-hatchings . Somewhere a night bird sang . Crickets concertized . Boards answered the creaking chair , a hum along the metal rails announced the streetcar . In the blackness beyond the veranda , out of the patch of electric light , a swarm of fireflies hung suspended , their thoraxes and underbellies emitting a Morse code of phosphorescent dots and dashes , secret messages , Niles thought , for him . " I saw Mrs. Pennyfeather on the way home . She said she 's going to ask you to do the flowers for church Sunday . " " Oh ? That will be nice . I must give it some thought . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked for everybody . " Mrs. Pennyfeather , who had charge of the Congregational choir , under the supervision of Professor Lapineaux , lived with her husband several blocks up the road . Instead of a mayor , Pequot Landing hadro8 The Other The Other 109a town board of selectmen , and Simon Pennyfeather , who was blind , had for many years held the post of First Selectman . He had been Vining 's oldest friend and was the executor of his will . Each year there was held a memorial dinner in honor of Granddaddy Perry , and Simon Pennyfeather 's jokes always kept the company which gathered in the dining room holdingtheir sides . " What 's wrong , " Niles asked . Suddenly Ada was sitting tight-lipped , her hands clutched in her lap . " Nothing  --  it 's all right . " She was fighting the agony in her fingers . " Does it hurt  --  have you got the pain again ? " Frightened for her , he raced to get her pills from the bottle over the sink , codeine , to relieve the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she had swallowed one with the water he brought her . " Soon , " she told him , and he took the glass back and filled it with cold root beer from the refrigerator , adding several cubes of ice and squeezing in half a lemon to make it tart , just the way she liked it . He returned to her and she sipped the drink , then set the glass down . " Spasiva , " she thanked him , catching her breath . He sat again on the step ; after a time her face seemed to relax and take on its natural color and she leaned her head back , the chair making slip-slip sounds on the raffia runner beneath the rockers . An expression he could not fathom played over her features . With her eyes closed , her head keepingever so slight time , it was as though the music she listened to was played for her ears alone . What was she thinking , he wondered , with that tiniest of smiles curling at the corners of her lips ? And , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little face and wrinkled her nose . " Ach , " she said without raising her lids , " **25;13286;TOOLONG . Saxophones are the devil 's instruments . " That was the Russian in her . Ada Katerina Petrichev . And being Russian , why should n't she have her Tchaikovsky pure ? It recalled to her her childhood , in the old Russia , that Imperial Russia which existed before the Bolsheviks and the Revolution , the girlhood she loved recounting , he and Holland popped into bed on either side of her , she warming blocks of colored wax with her fingers for them to make little figures , frog , unicorn , angel , and telling them long-ago stories . Stories of the big estate , the dacha outside St. Petersburg where her father worked as the major domus , her mother the housekeeper , her two younger sisters chambermaids , and Ada Katerina herself doing all the sewing for Madame , the great lady of the dacha , and her little daughter , because , Madame said , how nimble were Ada Katerina 's fingers . Though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stirring , Ada Katerina was earlier yet , throwing off the covers of her white iron bed , kneeling on the floor , praying before her icon , then dressing and going abroad to walk solitary along the path between the fields of wild sunflowers , fields spread so wide and far and deep that they seemed unending , stretching away from the path in gentle undulations as far as the eye could see , bobbing and swaying like a sea of gold , on which Ada Katerina had thought a ship might sail away , sail away forever over those waves of flowers , as high as a man 's head . There on the path she felt all the world was yellow , and tranquil . So enormous she could not even begin to imagine how enormous it was . To be alone in that sunflower world was to be at peace , and this was something that belonged to her alone . " Always I would go by myself , for I did not want to talk or chatter like those other magpie girls . And me barefooted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ r ralways Ada with her bare feet no matter what mamnuschka would say , this being in a time when my toes had not corns and bare feet was always such delight for me . I am thinking on these fine mornings how homesick I should be if ever I had to leave my sunflowers , and how contented I was in my heart . And I could see things . That is , one kind of thing in another kind of thing , things that were not really there at all . And I could find faces and figures in almost anything , in everything : in the clouds and in the trees and in the water . On the ceiling , even . " Oh , yes , they had a face too , on their ceiling . " And then , afterward , came the game . " O0000h , the game . Stroking her hair with a brush as she leaned back against the pillows of her white iron bed , modestly , " Oh , well , the game is not so hard , you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made out , though they knew better . ) " A little pretend game is all . There is a trick to it , do you see ? Just  --  well , thinking , that was all . Pick something and look at it . Pretty soon you are looking and looking and looking at it . And you are thinking about that one thing , you are thinking so hard , and sometimes you squeeze up your eyes and you remember the picture of the thing behind your eyelids , and the sun is making all colored dots behind there , and then you open your eyes and you can see what that thing is really like . What it really is . Looking into it , you pass through it . " It 's a trick , is n't it ? " Yas , I think so , but if a trick , it is a Russian one . " As if that explained it all . But how ? How ? " Well , Russians , if you can see it , feel more than do most people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sixth or seventh sense that God did n't give to most other people . They have alot more of what do you call it  --  " Thinking a moment . " Insight . Yas . That is the word . Insight . They are mystical folk , Russians , and , " she added jokingly , " the drunker they get , the more mystical they get . Worse than the Irish , Russians . " But they could do it too . " But of course , you are half Russian . What should you expect ? " But tell some more . Tell about the little daughter and the dog , the mad dog that lurked ! All excited , waiting for the familiar tale . " Well , " she would always begin , " that damn dog was a terror about the place , a big Russian hound they used on the wolves , and what belonged to the gamekeeper ; named Zoltan , that dog . I am standing by the thicket near the woods when he goes by , skulking at the heels of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at it , and I am thinking what nobody else is thinking , that dog Zoltan is mad . " Tapping her forehead . " Not yet completely , but it is coming , slowly , you know , and he must be watched . I say to myself , Beware of mad dogs lurking , for lurking , they shall bite . ' Then I think , And biting , shall bite again . ' I hear my mind say this to me two , three times , whenever that Zoltan goes by , and I believe it . Well , one afternoonMadame is in the summer house with the little daughter and some other ladies , and I am bringing for them koschnoijca , tea and little cakes arranged on a tray , and the gentlemen are away between the stone deer where was the croquet lawn . The ladies are all talking together and I am laying out the tea things and I see how the little daughter is going down the steps and over the grass to watch the croquet , and behind her at the edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all dark and evillookingwith prickly brambles and I am forgetting altogether about the tea things as I am looking and looking there at that thicket . I am thinking , what is there about it ? And I say to112 The Othermyself , well , a crow is sure walking on my grave . Now , at once the hair at the back of my neck is rising , I can feel it , and I am standing up from my chair with all the lovely tea things crashing to the floor , and my hand is reaching out to stop whatever it is I know must happen . " Yes , they say solemnly , knowing what must happen , waitingbreathlessly for her to go on . Now there follows the pale astonished look on the face of Madame , her little cry as Ada Katerina dashes from the summerhouse , across the lawn to the child , who is smiling at the croquet players , who do not know anything of what is happening , and Ada snatches up the child just as the great mad dog Zoltan plunges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jaws all white and foamy . It means to eat up the little daughter  --  " Ach , so strong the jaws , so sharp the teeth "  --  bur instead it gives a fierce bite on Ada 's leg , trying to fell her . But Ada has pulled away , the back of her dress in the dog 's teeth , and , trailing blood , runs to safety in the summerhouse , where the child is given into the grateful mother 's arms , and then , oh then , the pain of the doctor treatingthe terrible bite on Ada 's leg , which to this day still makes her limp when the weather turns cold , or she is tired or upset . Madame now took the brave Ada Katerina into her care , giving her a gift of money and a dress as well , one from her own wardrobe , and some ribbon for her hair , and never sayinganything about the broken teacups , which were costly . And how strange , Madame thinks , that Ada had known about the mad dog lurking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But , Beware when mad dogs lurk , for lurking they shall bite , was all Ada could reply to her queries , remembering always to add , And biting , shall bite again . So it became common knowledge in those parts that Ada Katerina had the Gift , and playfully they would tease her , Ada Katerina , be for us a bee , a flower , an owl . The Other 113Sometimes in the evenings Madame would call for her sewinggirl , who was now permitted the pleasure of reading books to her as well , and to come out into the summerhouse where sat all the ladies and gentlemen , and Ada Katerina , very shy in her new dress embroidered with flowers , but mysterious looking , too , her hair with ribbons braided in it and hanging about her shoulders like a gypsy 's , seated on a stool at the great people 's feet , would tell what it was like to be a bee , a flower , an owl . Ahhh . Yes , Holland and Niles loved that part . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the lurking dog ! " Enough , children , time to go to your own beds . " No , no . Pajalsta , pajalsta ! And , tugging on their hair , each in turn , she would continue . " Ach , that damn dog . Russians , as you know , are most fond of animals , they can love them with a great love , like you love a person , even though they should do a bad thing . So Wasili the gamekeeper would not destroy the dog , refusing to believe that it was mad at all , and he chained it in the stables . But one night Wasili , who had been out on his horse looking for poachers ( so they all thought ) , came home drunk , they said , for they could hear him singing in the wood . Well , when he got in dat stables dere , de horse became frightened of dat dog Zoltan and he must have Crown dat Wasili and before you know it dat Zoltan has torn Wasili 's t'roat out for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could tell , listening , for her English always got worse when she was like that . And sometimes she would shiver at the memory and , laughing , say that a crow was walking on her grave . Now about Grandpapa ! Yes , Grandpapa ! Well , it so fell out that Ada Katerina became in love with the son of the gardener , he who tended Madame 's roses , Pavel Vedrenya was his name , and he knew all there was to know114 The Otherabout flowers , and when they had enough money together they were married , and he bought their passage to America , and thus the clock that stands at the top of the stairs came to the little house in Baltimore where Ada and Grandpapa lived for many years until he died and where he had a glass house full of plants and flowers to sell . The rest of her family dead , Ada paid for the passage of her sisters as well , Josephine and Fania , who was called Fanuschka , so they might come to America also . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ada would plant to remind her of the fields of St. Petersburg and of the Ada Katerina who had been and who was now Ada Vedrenya , sunflowers in her dooryard , along the fence , beside the garage . And when she came to Pequot Landingshe put seeds into the earth behind the carriage-house , where they grew tall and these flowers were favorites of all the others , each with its own sun-face to greet her in the summer morning . As the Sunflower turns on her god , when he sets , The same look which she turned when he rose . These lines she had found in a book and copied them out , and the thought seemed to please her . But with the passing of the years the flowers reminded her less of the old country and more of her grandsons , with their twin fringes of bright yellow , like the rays of the flowers , and truly , to her , it seemed their shining faces sent forth rays . And it was only sometimes , like this evening , with the Tchaikovsky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be reminded of white embroidered dresses and ribbons and the soft evenings in the summerhouse on the big dacha at St. Petersburg . Slip-slip went the rocker . The music over , Ada opened her eyes to smile wistfully at Niles . " Tchaikovsky with saxophones , " she muttered , " it is like salami . Ach , I should notThe Other 11 fcomplain  --  I never hear Tchaikovsky hardly before I come to America . " " Why ? " " In Russia there was no place for us to hear music , except Madame sometimes playing her piano , but she always played French songs , never nothing like Tchaikovsky . And in Russia when I was a girl there was no music for the poor people exceptwhat we made for ourselves . Ach , how I love the music ! " " Then the Russians should be happier there today . " " Why is that ? " " Because now they have music for the poor people . " " For the poor people , yas . But I 'm not sure they 're any happier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could tell how much she missed the old Russia . " You miss the sunflowers , " he said , reaching to touch her hand across the space between them . " But we have sunflowers too , not too many , but some , " he said , as though apologizing for the paucity of flowers . " And butterflies . You love butter-flies . " " Here all the sunflowers have dust on their faces , " she said , then fell silent and thought for a time . " Well , " she said at last , " I shall have to select some flowers for the church service , no ? Some larkspur , I think , and coreopsis ; perhaps some baby 's breath , if it looks to be good . " Larkspur . Coreopsis . He remembered misty mornings with the sun a white disk behind the mist when they would waken her early and lead her into the still-wet meadow where she would pick buttercups and daisies and wild roses ; select others from the flower beds : pansies with faces like oriental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ processions with petal faces , snapdragon horses drawing carriages of Queen Anne 's lace. t z6 The Other I The Other 117 " Or perhaps some iris , " she thought aloud , " an arrangement either side of the pulpit . " " No  --  one big bowl , and put it on the table under her . " Her . Ada 's smile widened . " Her " was the figure in one of the stained glass windows , the Angel of the Annunciation , arriving with the glad tidings , a beautiful piece of work showingher sweeping to earth on giant luminous wings , one hand clasping a lily . It was Niles who had made up a name for her , " The Angel of the Brighter Day , " a kind and loving pretend creature whom he fancied as a guardian spirit . Ada sat up . " What 's that you say ? Queen Anne 's lace ? " He had said nothing ; but , " Sure . There 's a ton of it in the meadow . I 'll pick you some tomorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holland had . The bond between them was undeniable . It was as if an invisible cord ran from his head to hers , and they could telephone to each other , the one sensing the other 's thoughts . He always knew before she spoke what she was going to ask him to do : a book from the library , her needlework , a Dixie cup of ice cream , feed oatmeal to her cat .. . except of course now there was no need for oatmeal ; the cat was dead . " And what else did you see at the fair ? " Ada asked . He thought a moment , then described for her the baby in the bottle . " Ach , such things should not be exhibited for children . It shall make nightmares for you . " " No it wo n't , " he assured her . " But it made Holland mad , and he hit the bottle with his hand and ran away . " But he was mad anyway . " " Y as ? What does he have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She shot him a glance . " I mean Mrs. Rowe . " He was hunched forward , eyes onthe blinking swarm of fireflies . " Dot-dit dit-dit dit-dot-dit-dit dit dit-dit-dit . " " What 's that ? " " Morse code . From the fireflies . Better than our crystal set . " His look was hopeful . " Can I do it now ? " " What ? " " The game . " Ach , the game . Tonight she felt weary . Usually , where the family was concerned , nothing was an intrusion on her time , her energies . Fix this , please ? Do that , would you ? Be this . Play that . Play a game , let 's ? The game , their game , the three of them . Here Torrie was an outsider . Alas , she had never been quick to see it ; called it " casting the spell , " made jokes about gypsies , and Russian superstitions . But the twins were another story . They seemed able to divine the thing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , Holland 's mind occasionallywandered , his concentration obscured by some flibbertygibbetprank or nonsense that amused him more ; but Niles , now  --  Niles was different . With him it seemed both innate and suitable . Ah , but he was quick ! Looking and looking and looking . Then feeling . Then knowing . And the knowing came as though a light had quite suddenly come on . Yes , interesting enough , this game , the effects harmless ; salutary even . And such fun . But Niles , she told herself , needed watching ; there was adanger lurking . Sometimes it seemed he would actually behypnotized . And who in the family could ever forget thatharrowing experience with the rooster ? Chanticleer , theycalled the bird ; wretched creature . . . that damn rooster .

How she adored indulging Niles , delighting in his whims and fancies , those cat-and-mouse insistences , his alluring make-believe ; loved his guileless face , eyes wonder-widened as his mind worked . And in time surely he would outgrow it  --  the way children outgrow Santa Claus . They must have their dreams , that is what being children is all about , is n't it ? Childhood was but a few brief summers ; winter a whole , cold , lifetime long . No  --  not yet , not yet . " Can we ? " he coaxed . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour was getting late . " It 's bedtime , child , " she told him . Aw , he said , Holland was still up . Pajalsta , pajalsta , just once ? And his " please " was so earnest , his smile so disarming , she had not the heart to deny him . With a deep breath , she nodded her head at the cluster of fireflies . " Very well , look there . Tell me what those are like . What do they feel like ? " Turning the gold band on her finger , she waited while he concentrated . Fireflies . Lightning bugs . What are they like ? Tiny pulses , bright seeds sown in the blackness . They look so . But what do they feel like ? Cold green stars , light years away , their glow produced by layers of specialized cells . Miniature neon dots . No  --  neon is cold . Hot , rather . Flies of fire , hot sparks burning in the night wind . Yes , that was it , now he was getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elm twigs cobwebs catching moon flames , laddered patterns as if dusted with golden pollen , burnTheOther H9ing in the gauzy night . There ! And there ! Luminous pinpointsigniting , now leaping to set the night ablaze , with shadows dancing while ashes swirl upward like black snow , sucked into the green fire , spiraling death into the night sky ... death . . . and horror .. . He was trembling ; goosebumps raised on end the yellow fuzz along his arms . He rubbed himself , laughing . " Cripes , that 's some crow that walked across my grave . " He rose from the step . " Well , it 's almost time for First Nighter . Want to listen ? No ? Okay . Shall I put your sewing in your room for you ? " She nodded without speaking and he carefully removed her work from her lap to put it in the basket . After he had kissed her , and the screen door clacked at his back as he carried the basket and Torrie 's doll-lamp inside , she remained a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling the warm night grow cold around her , while terror stole across her mind , so quietly , so stealthily , so imperceptibly that , absently fingering her swollen knuckles , she was taken quite unawares . Niles went up to Torrie and Rider 's room and presented his sister with the doll-lamp , then returned to the upper hall where he had left Ada 's sewing basket sitting by the newel post . He went along the gallery and opened her door . The room had a clean , spare look . Other than a chest of drawers , a straight-backed chair beside a lamp , an iron bedstead painted white like the one she 'd slept on in Russia , on the floor a rug she 'd hooked herself , in blue and white , the room was quite bare . On one wall hung a single small icon in a gold frame . You could tell a lot about Ada by looking at her room , Niles decided , setting her work basket by the chair . On the bureau was a large picture book , old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book whose pages he and Holland120 The Otherknew by heart now . The Illustrated Dore . He lifted the cover and looked at the spidery handwriting inside . Ada Katerina Vedrenya . Baltimore , Maryland 1894 . A faint aroma arose from the pages : she used it for pressing flowers . He dropped the cover and , softly closing the door behind him , went down the hall and hurried into the back wing to his own room . He did n't want to miss the beginning of First Nighter . The earphones to the crystal set were lying on Holland 's bed . He put them on , lay down on the cover , tuned in the set , and listened . The play tonight was n't very good and he amused himself by watching the face which seemed to form itself out of the center of the waterstain on the ceiling overhead : two eyes , a nose , a mouth . A familiar face . But whose ? Whose ? Gripes , what a lousy program . When it was over , he yawned , removed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ south . Along the drive the fir trees , green-black against the sky ; appeared a pantheon of bearded gods  --  Wotan , Fafnir , Thor  --  their arms stretching , stirring and stretching toward him in the wind . Gold , gold was what they craved  --  Nibelung gold ; Peregrine gold . From time to time the sky was vividly dyed by fireworkswhooshing away down at the green . The pump cast a sentinelshadow onto the drive near the well , bits of gravel glittering , washed white as the waxing hunchback moon climbed the sky . A whistle hooted ; a line of smoke appeared beyond the darktreetops as a train wound along the spur of track below thehighway . Too-oo-oot , as it passed the Rose Rock bottlingworks at Church Street  --  a lonely sound , yet , Niles thought , not as lonely as the rattle , the clatter , the clang of the ShadowHills trolley . That was the loneliest sound in the world .. . And as the hoot of the train died away to the north , herecame the clang of the streetcar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the track from Talcotts Ferry . You can set your watch by that trolley , Father used to say : it 's always five minutes late . Larger and larger it loomed , lights bright , though bereft of passengers , the solitary Mr. Conductor lost in thought  --  wife ? home ? dinner ?  --  feet spread wide apart for balance as the car swung along the rails . Ding-ding-ding . There it goes , five minutes late for sure  --  Niles checks his watch  --  the Shadow Hills Express , on the way out to Babylon . End of the line . He listens to the bell  --  ding-ding-ding  --  as the trolley clatters by the house . He longed to get on that old Shadow Hills Express and , sitting on one of the straw-covered seats , ride all the way out to Babylon , to the end of the line . Shadow Hills ? Oh , it 's just a name , Winnie had said when he asked her about it . Just a. a place , that 's all . No , the hills were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that way , and Jennie , her sister ; her father worked servicing the trolleys at the car barn . But was it true , what Holland said ? Babylon was a fabulous place , to hear him tell it . A metropolis  --  El Dorado , practically , with a huge palace , grand flights of stairs , gates of brass , towers , pennants flying from the peaked turrets . Winnie laughed and shook her head . Bunk . There wa' n't nothin ' like that in Babylon . There was just that bleak old red place , brick , she said , with iron gates and steps leading up , terrible dump  --  more fort than palace . Ding-ding-ding  --  away in the distance now . . . But Niles wanted to see for himself . Sometimes , when that lonely feeling would come over him , when he would be longing for something  --  what , he did n't quite know what  --  suddenly it would come to him that he was feeling homesick for Shadow Hills , a place he had never been to . Funny ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never seen ? 122 The Other The Other 123Babylon  --  end of the line . And Holland never did any more than shrug and sing his clever little rhyme : How many miles to Babylon ?  --  Threescore miles and ten . Can I get there by candlelight ?  --  Yes , and back again . He had moved to the west window , where he could look out past the barn , the peregrine weathervane motionless in the moonlight , tail to the east , its amber eye seemingly fixed on the river . Thrusting against the water 's band of silvery light was the dead sycamore where , summers , you could swing from its trunk and leap into the stream , winters use it as shelter , with old tires burning near its base for warmth while you skated . With a blur Niles remembered it was there that Billy Talcott had drowned , under the ice . That had been over George Washington 's Birthday . Niles , bedded with the croup , had gotten up to go to the bathroom . Passing the window , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his limp , could only hobble around on the ice , but when it gave way under him , he was close enough to the bank so that Holland , poking up the fire , could have rescued him . But , instead , he ran  --  ran and left Billy thrashing , freezing in the icy water . Niles turned to see Holland walk in , and go to throw himself down on his bed . " Did you go to see the fireworks ? " Niles asked . " No . " He was staring up at the brown waterstain on the ceiling directly overhead . " There 's a beauty ! " Niles exclaimed as a rocket exploded in the distance . No answer . Holland was sulking again . Niles combed his mind for an agreeable subject to ease the tension . " What 's so funny ? " Holland wanted to know . " I was just thinking . " " Yeah ? " He looked over . " I was just thinking about the five-legged pig in the freakshow . Remember Mr. La Fever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ La Fever , Arnie 's father , was not only threelegged , but was a scandal as well  --  but not because of the extra limb . Mr. La Fever , who worked in the Ringling Brothers sideshow , had some years ago caused a flurry of attention around town by getting a girl pregnant . Their rendezvous , he later confessed , was on the baggage platform of the freight depot across from Fenstermacher 's Rose Rock bottling works . The girl , a live-in maid brought up from the Girl 's Reformatoryat Middlehaven , was brokenhearted when she was returned to confinement , and her tri-legged lover , already married , fled to the circus 's winter quarters at Sarasota . The baby was put out for adoption and Pequot Landing had n't stopped talking yet . Arnie got mad when you joked about his old man . " Put that away somewhere , " Holland growled . Niles was sitting and , without thinking , rattling the Prince Albert tin . He considered the contents . Peregrine for Perry . The Thing . The Thing was gruesome ; of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , tried to put it out of his mind . It was all Holland 's doing . Holland had decreed it all . Yet Niles was the one who must keep the Secret .. . Yep , he was getting a Look . " I told you not to carry it around . " Chastened , Niles deliberated over a suitable hiding place . " Where should I put it ? In the compartment ? " Holland shook his head . The whole family knew about the secret compartments Father had built into the matching chests . Even Winnie knew . He took the tin from Niles and went to the wall next to the closet door where , hanging on hooks , was the Chautauqua desk , Ada 's present to the twins . There was a blackboard with cubbyholes , and wire coils that held chalk , 124 The Otherand a wide scroll of colored chromographs which turned up and down , illustrating Bible stories . Other scrolls in the closet informed not only about nature and paleontology , but biology , astronomy , mythology , and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tobacco tin behind the picture roll and reset the spindle in position . Niles shook his head . " That 's no good . Mother found the Civil War dollar behind there , remember ? " Holland turned the scroll until Jesus Delivering the Sermon on the Mount came into view . " She does n't come in here any more , " he said coolly . Then , something exciting his attentionat the window , he gasped and rushed to put out the lamp between the two beds and hurried back to his place . " Niles ! " he exclaimed , " look ! " " What ? " " C'mere . Look ! " Opposite , in the wing parallel to their own , was one lighted window , the shade drawn . A man 's shadow was crossing behind it  --  light , shadow , pause , light , shadow , pause . Another shadow appeared , smaller , big-bellied ; an embrace followed . " It 's Torrie and Rider , " Niles heard Holland breathe . A silence , then : " Come on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Niles was shocked . " Do n't worry , little brother , they wo n't know . " Holland 's tone was suave and inviting . " Come on . " Niles felt himself propelled out the door , guided along the front hall in the path of a flashlight beam , past the grandfather clock , into the north wing , then up a pair of steps behind a door , over the landing , down more steps and into the storeroom . Maniac shadows leaped about the walls ; the trunks squatted like fat coffins , the dress dummy loomed , big-busted , narrow-waisted , pins in it glinting . Niles felt his hand brush aThe Other 125web spun across the wicker cradle ; a spider , a black jewel , dropped to the floor and sidled behind the rocking horse . He turned , starting nervously at his own reflection in the mirroreddoor of the wardrobe . Beyond , through a crack in the far wall , a light showed . Creeping silently over the floor in the path of the flashlight , Niles listened to low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crack , partly hidden by a chest of drawers , was Torrie and Rider 's bed , a fourposter , canopied with tasseled netting . On it Torrie lay , unclothed , a carelessly pulled-down sheet draped over her feet . On the bedside table , Niles 's doll-lamp shed warm light over the delicate contours of her face , her breasts , her swollen belly . Rider turned off the overhead light and stretched out naked beside her , cradling her in his arms . In the lamp-glow he nuzzled her ripe breasts with his mouth , one dark hand gently caressing her stomach , his fingers moving slowly over the mound of her belly . " Oh , " she giggled , " she just kicked , the monster . Feel ? " " Mmm . " Rider turned his head sideways between her breasts while her hand traced the curve of his back along his spine . " Hey , " he said suddenly , lifting his eyes , " somebody 's watching ! " Niles saw Holland start , pull back , flick the flashlight off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Torrie giggled again . " I think it 's sweet , " she said , reaching to fluff out the skirtshadeof the fat , impish-looking doll-lamp . " Oops , there she goes again . " She took his hand and replaced it on her stomach . " Well , let 's hurry and have this one , " he said huskily , " so we can make another . " She raised his head and looked at him , her face languid , suffusedwith tenderness . " Darling Rider , " she said , brushing the126 The Otherbacks of her hands along the hollow of his cheeks , " it 's going to be a lovely baby . A beautiful baby . " " What makes you so sure ? " " I know . Niles says so . He keeps telling me . " " How does he know ? " " It 's that silly game they play . " " What game ? " " I swear they 're gypsies . " Torrie 's voice was muffled behind the wall as she explained about the game , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a tree , a bird , a flower ; how silly she thought it , how dismayed Ada was with her . There was a summer day when Ada had brought the three of them down behind the carriage-house to see one of her half-dried sunflowers , a giant , over twice their height . Dominatedby Ada 's will , they had looked , tried to know it . What was it like ? Color , texture ; how tall , how old ? Smell . Hot , cold . Rough , smooth . Their young brains compelled by hers to concentrate , to discover the heart of it , its essence , as Ada called it . Your mind is wandering ( this to Holland , skylarking about the sunflower patch , doing handstands and cartwheels , an antic gleam in his eye , Don Quixote mad ) . Look there , look there . Leading them a strange way along a strange path to play a strange child 's game . The sunflower viewed , noted , memorized . Then : What does it feel like ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued . " He said , I feel pretty . ' Is n't that marvelous ? Then a crow flew by and picked a seed from the face of the flower  --  and Niles cried , said it hurt . And Holland  --  " " What 'd he do ? " Rider asked . " He laughed . And Ada shushed him . But I remember her saying this one thing . She said , Now do you understand whatThe Other 127it is you can feel ? ' See what I mean about gypsies ? Honestly ! But Niles is just tremendous . He 's uncanny sometimes , the predictions he comes out with . " " Did he predict we 'd be rich ? " " No , but he said the north meadow 'd be onions again , and next year it will  --  and that was when you were still planning to be a lawyer . " " Pity he could n't have predicted for Vining or  --  " " Hush . Not in front of the baby . " They nestled closer and , lying in each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Torrie reaching at one point to smooth the skirt of the doll-lamp , Niles 's present . And the baby would be beautiful , a girl , as he predicted . They would find the perfect name for such a perfect child . It would be a thanksgiving baby , for it had been conceived Thanksgiving night ; out of the storm of grief over her father 's death passion had arisen , and though they had planned to wait , it was Torrie 's desire that the life lost be replaced . Now , come August , she would give birth . She had hoped it would be a boy  --  another Vining to take her father 's place  --  but Niles insisted it would be a girl . A short time later , when Rider had snapped off the doll- lamp , the murmurs became even breathing and they slept . " Jeeze , " Holland hissed , spreading his fingers over the flashlight lens to create weird patterns on the walls . Niles followed him back across the room . When they got to the door Holland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " He gave the cradle a push which set it rocking noiselessly . " Who ? " " Torrie . Rider . Making that baby . Making it together . Thanksgiving night . I saw them . " " Saw them ? " Niles was thunderstruck . " You watched ? " 128 The Other " They were on the bed . In the light . He was on top of her  --  right on top . Moving . " The words formed dryly in his throat before he spat them out , describing what he had seen through the crack in the wall . " With the lights on . Damned hermaphrodite . That 's what they are  --  a hermaphrodite . Half- man , half-woman . " " That 's what a marriage is . " " Well , I 'm telling you this , it wo n't be a pretty baby like she thinks . Like you think . It 'll be ugly and white with pop eyes and a great big head . Like the baby in the bottle ! " In his strange humor Holland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and his voice was a strangled cry as he threw aside the flashlight and fled the room . In a moment Niles crossed the floor and picked up the light . Bright moonshine spilled onto the sill where King Cophetua lay , a slain warrior . In the sky stars glittered like snow , brittle and crystalline , turning the summer night into winter spectacle . Then , standing and looking out , Niles saw a strange sight . The screen door at the head of the outside stairs had quietly opened ; a figure appeared : Mother . Pausing uncertainly on the landing , she tripped hurriedly down , one white hand skimming the banister , its enamel paint gleaming in the moonlight . Si- lently she slipped over the lawn , her lavender wrapper shim- mering across the dark grass , like a beautiful spectre , crossing the gravel and into the fir trees , where she made her way be- tween the dark trunks , the pale violet blur almost lost to view , stepping on the thatch of fallen pine needles , until she reached the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands hanging limp at her sides , the clover a dark floor around her feet . And as she looked down at the heavy seal over the well mouth , it seemed to Niles that it was as though she were waiting for it to speak . One morning several weeks later , seated in the kitchen , Niles held himself in patience while Aunt Josie performed certain ministrations on his face . Sinister , that was the look ; and properly so , just what he 'd wanted , precisely the effect Holland had managed : faded , a little decadent , a sort of seedy type , one who , he suspicioned , had a dirty mind ; probably did things with little kids ; hair parted in the middle , slicked back , patent-leatherish , and , where Aunt Josie had been at pains with the makeup , interesting-looking . A dusting of white practically blotted out his features , with a touch of rouge ( roodge , she called it ) on the cheeks , a bit of penciling around the eyes , the brows worked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mustaches drawn on . " Sweetheart , you look just like Mr. Coffee Nerves in the Postum ads , " Aunt Josie said as he stepped into Winnie 's room to view himself in the mirror . " Hey  --  good , " Niles called back . " That 's really great . " He came to stand in the doorway . He had on a top hat and a cape with a red lining , and he leaned sportily on a cane , one foot crossed over the other . " I should have long pants , " he said , looking ruefully at his rolled shorts . " And a stiff shirt . " " Soup ' n ' fish ? I think you look just fine , sweetheart . " 130 The Other The Other 13 ! ( Switthot , she said . ) " Here , you got a bit too much roodge there . " She wet her thumb on her tongue and worked at his cheek . " Okay , Perfesser , I guess you 'll pass mustard . " She looked at him with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I go along and announce you , Perfesser Rabbit-waters ? " " Well , " he said doubtfully , " you go ahead . I 'll be out after . There 's something else I want to get . " He disappeared up the back stairs . " Be sure to stop in and show yourself to Zan , " she called after him . The screen door whined as she went along the walk to join the others in the arbor . Built for Granddaddy Perry 's wife with his own hands , it stood at the far edge of the lawn next to the vacant lot on the north side of the house , a cool oasis of white posts and trellises , with turf between the flagstones and grapevined shade . The walk was brick , laid down in sand in a herringbone pattern , the corners mossy green and rounded with use , the faces heaved by winter frost . The month was deep into July , the aunts had arrived , and today , gathered around a table in wicker chairs were Aunt Fania and Torrie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Niles in arithmetic , and Ada behind an easel , capturing Granddaddy 's roses on a watercolor block . Mrs. Jewett had opened the front of her boucle knitted dress  --  rather too warm for the weather  --  and was fanning her bosom . " Well , " she declared as Aunt Josie came up , " no matter what anybody says , carelessness breeds accidents . " " To say nothing of babies . " Aunt Josie 's deep laugh rumbled through the arbor like approaching thunder . Behind her hob-nailed glass , Aunt Fanny hooted in spite of herself . She toyed with the bits of fruit floating in thewine punch Winnie had concocted to dissipate the afternoon heat . " Oops , " said Aunt Jo , seating herself . Aunt Josie was a card . For her , nothing in life was without its humor , neither Man nor Beast , War nor Peace , Hate nor Love . Ah , Love especially . Her own spinsterhood she regarded as a prank life had played on her , a sly one at that , but what was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , she had for years toured in vaudeville sketches around the country , but with talkies in she had found more regular employment assisting a **25;13313;TOOLONG New York , where she shared with her sister an apartment on Morningside Heights . As happens , the aunts looked nothing alike , and resembled Ada even less . If it were possible to liken Josie to a favorite chair  --  comfortable , ample , a bit lumpy  --  Fanny was more the auditorium seat : austere , meager , rigid . Where Josie was merry and plump , Fanny was all angles and dour ; Josie 's voice a gravelly rumble , Fanny 's more a bark ; in moments of mirth an abrupt cackle was the best she could manage . But  --  most important  --  while Aunt Josie was fun , told stories , cracked jokes , performed parlor tricks , played pinochle , did devastating impressions , Aunt Fanny , alas , remained prim , wore her corset , eschewed cards , knew no jokes worth telling , and abhorred magic . " Well , " she said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me it was careless of Mr. Angelini , leaving a hayfork around . " Pausing over her watercolor box , Ada shook her head sympathetically . " He 's just a ghost , the poor man . I feel so sorry . It is awful to see him blame himself and suffer so . " " Daresay , " Fanny agreed , " but it looks to me like he 's been nipping a bit ; least he do n't seem any too steady on his132 The Otherfeet . " With a brisk click of dentures she snapped her mouth shut , bobbing her head in time with the piano music that had been drifting across from an open window over at the Rowe house . " Tum-da-da-da-dum , " she sang , arranging her skirt and tidily crossing her ankles . Where Josie was the offhand sort , looking more frequentlythan not as though she had put on the first thing that came to hand , an old sweater , the odd skirt , Fanny was meticulous in her costume . Today she was wearing an anklelengthdress of ecru @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white shoes with punctured patterns which permitted the air to circulate around her feet . On her head was a man 's Panama hat with a black band , her face swathed mummy-fashion under the voluminous swirl of white maline she had purchased at the five-and-ten , a precaution against bees and other stinging insects . " Did you find Russia awfully changed , Josephine ? " Mrs. Jewett inquired lugubriously . " Poor , " Josie answered . " Rah-sha iss poor . " " I should think so . Those Bolsheviks have n't a sou to their names . " " Rubles , Edith . " Josie had spent the month of February in the Soviet Union , assisting her boss on a picture story for the National Geographic  --  a hydroelectric project in the Ukraine . It was the first time she had been back since she was a little girl . " Russia is so poor now , " she went on , " the peasants use borscht for blood transfusions . " Everyone laughed except Ada , apart from the group and concentrating on her work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Jewett . " No  --  Siberia 's not for the poor folks , dearie . And I 'm strictly proletariat . " She leaned to snap her garter , rolled in her stocking above a sausage knee . " The aristocracy 's all in Siberia . " The Other 133 " Hmp , Roosevelt they should send to Siberia . " Sipping , Aunt Fanny adjusted herself in her chair . " Ta-dum-dum-dada-dah . What is that song ? " Torrie rolled her eyes . " Mrs. Rowe and her Turkish Rondo  --  at least I think that 's what it is . " " Oh , Beethoven , of course , " said Mrs. Jewett , blowing down her front . " I think it 's Mozart . " " Do you mean to say that old woman still sits and plays the piano ? " Aunt Fanny asked . " Does she signal the airplanes any more ? " " Sometimes , " Torrie said and Aunt Fanny cackled . " If she can hear the motor over that racket . " " I should think so . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia on this day , Mrs. Jewett cast about for anothersubject . " How 's Valeria ? " she asked brightly , " still in Chicago ? " Torrie nodded . " We think she 'll stay a while . She 's taken it all very badly . " " Do her good to get away from George for a bit , should n't wonder , " said Fanny with asperity . Her views on marital bliss  --  so called  --  were well known . She regarded her own separate state as a blessing . Although Josie was still a Petrichev , Ada a Vedrenya , Fanny was a Fish  --  Mrs. Epifania Fish . With Mr. Fish , whose first name had long ago escaped memory , she had embarked on a whirlwind elopement and six months later had secured a mysterious divorce . Now she was more a spinster than Josie , and though she kept the name , there were few who could recall the last time they had heard her mention Mr. Fish . " And how 's George ? " Mrs. Jewett wanted to know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fact that he had become most irascible and that evenings found134 The Otherhim holed up in either the dining room or his bedroom with a bottle of Southern Comfort . " And Alexandra ? " Mrs. Jewett continued , determined to assay by turn the health of the entire family . " Does she still keep to her room ? " she asked , unable to see Alexandra 's window from her place under the tangle of grapevines . " Ca n't think how she 's stayed cooped up in there for  --  how long 's it been ? " She ticked off her manicured nails . " March , April , May , June , July  --  why that 's five months already . " " Four , " Torrie corrected her . " She 'll be better when she 's a grandmother . She 's already helping me plan the layette and soon as there 's formula to fix and diapers to change  --  " " If Winnie 'll let her , " Aunt Josie said , draining her glass with a slurp and a smack . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A girl could get a jag on if she 's not careful . Would n't think you could get vinegar from these old grapes , would you ? Watch it , Fanuschka , here it comes again . " Her sister had been flapping a flyswatter at a wasp buzzing around the fruit overhead , and which was now studiously drawing z 's around her glass . " Eee ! " shrieked Fanny , dropping the glass and retreating to a corner of the arbor . " Shoo ! Shoo ! " " Shoo , wasp , " Torrie said calmly with a wave , and retrievedthe unbroken glass . " It 's all right , Fan , " Josie rumbled , " it 's gone . Come sit . " Aunt Fanny 's fear of stinging insects stemmed from an experience she had once had when a bee stung her and she had almost died , the poisonous toxin entering her body and invadingher whole system . Now , visiting in the country , she took elaborate precautions because , she said , she had a theory ( Russian superstition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she called them , actually knew those victims who were most proneThe Other 13Sto their danger , hence the veiling and the flyswatter . Aunt Fan was taking no chances . " Ooh my , " Josie boomed , casting an eye up toward the house , " here comes Winnie with a refill . " At the back-entryway the screen door slammed and Winnie hove into view bearing another pitcher of frosty purple liquid . In a second the door whined again and a figure appeared at the end of the brick wall , shrouded in black , the white face sinister , macabre , mocking .. . " Oh my God ! " Her veil lifted around her glass , Aunt Fanny turned pale as she stared , making a cross of her thumb and finger and kissing it in the Russian way , and accidentally spilling some wine onto the netting as she did so . " Holland  --  " " Oh for heaven 's sakes , Fanuschka , " Josie said , " it 's not Holland , it 's Niles . Look ! Watch this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cape trailing , now and then a flash of red , the silk hat tipped jauntily over one eye . Incredibly , buttoned across the sneakers were a pair of pearl gray spats . Lifting the hat , twirling the cane , bowing , along the herringbonebrick came Professor Rabbitwaters . " The spitting image , " Mrs. Jewett said , leaning out of her chair . " Never saw anything  --  hel-lo Mysterious One , " she called coyly . Without acknowledgment , as though to avoid encounter with the playful Mrs. Jewett , the dark figure cut over the croquet lawn to the horse-chestnut tree and intently studied the bark . He looked up at the branches , thinking of autumn , when the nuts would have completely formed in their prickly jackets and could be knocked down with a stick . Suddenly he stiffened and wheeled as , with a faint crowing , Chanticleer , the old stringy rooster , came haughtily pecking under the tree in search of worms , then , shaking out its tail feathers like136 The Othera clutch of sabers as it spied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye . Niles returned the stare , then , head immobile , he backed silently away , cane extended as though to ward off harm , giving the bird a wide berth as he made his way out onto the lawn again , passing Winnie on her way back to the kitchen . Ada , brush poised in mid-air as she caught the boy 's action , observed him thoughtfully while his eyes remained fastened on the rooster . It was the same old story ; neither of them had changed , neither boy nor bird . With a pang she thought of how it had gone , that shocking business  --  the twins must have been ten that year ; she had been sitting in almost the same spot under the arbor , shelling limas for succotash ; Winnie was in the kitchen shucking corn , Holland and Niles near the well . Head high , pecking , from time to time ruffling out its feathers in the same insolent way , the rooster had circled the pump . Then , eyes riveted on the bird , Niles had slipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motions , bent arms jerking , rump sticking out in back , a tailful of feathers seemingly sprouting there . From his throat came the identical half-crowing sound of the bird . A comical sight to be sure . Even from where she sat she could see the beads of perspiration appear on his brow , the fixed , almost obsessed expression on his pale face , the eyes glassy and intense . Niles , Niles , that 's enough , child . No more . Just then Winnie had hollered from the window for Ada to bring the beans ; Niles , following the rooster , disappeared behind the barn . She was at the sink , rinsing off the limas , when she heard the cry : she and Winnie ran out the door to find Holland pointing up at the carriage-house roof , where , on the peak , Chanticleer perched , wings flapping , crowing lustily . Behind him , incredibly , was Niles , precariously balanced , arms flapping , shrill crowing noises issuing from his throat . Terrified , The Other 137motioning for the others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , Niles . It is not important now  --  Er-rrr-a-rrr-aro o-o oo ! He took no notice ; his eyes remained battened on the bird ; his head turned jerkily ; he pecked , he flapped , he strutted , he crowed , would not , could not cease . Niles , she said in relief , after Mr. Angelini had brought his ladder and led him down from the roof . What on earth were you doing ? I was n't on earth , he told her excitedly . But what possessed you ? Breathless , bewildered , eyes luminous with unaccustomed brightness , he tried to explain . Chanticleer  --  1 was doing the game on Chanticleer . A fine dew of sweat still lay across his forehead . Just  --  you know  --  to see what it was like to be a rooster . But then , I could n't stop . I really was Chanticleer . I could n't help it ! Could n't ? The word baffled her . Could you not stop ? Yes . I think so , if 1 stopped thinking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pondering the mystery of it . What , child ? I did n't want to . So it had been with the rooster . And still it was n't over .. . With a shiver , Ada rinsed out her camel hair brush in a jelly glass and quietly rose . Leaving the arbor , she approached Niles across the lawn . " Child , " she said softly , motioning her hands at the rooster , who shook his wattles and pranced away . " Niles ? " " Yes . " " Come along . " She took his hand and he went with her toward the arbor . " Oh Niles is doing ever so much better with his arithmetic problems , " exclaimed Mrs. Jewett elaborately so as to be138 The Other overheard by the boy , and Aunt Josie called , " Niles , sweet- heart , are we going to have a show this year ? " " Yes , " he said as Ada reseated herself at the easel . He came and parked his rear on the arm of Aunt Josie 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are , " he said , peering out to the street , hoping for sight of Holland . " With a special trick . " " Oh ? Then I must have a new specialty act , " she said , nodding so her curls bobbed . Fat and stiff and of an unlikely mixture of reds , these were bent each night into coils ; released in the morning , they snapped to life like bedsprings all over her head . " Now , what ? " she wondered , " Camille ? " She put on a tragic face and coughed loudly . Aunt Fan cackled , but Niles , after consideration , vetoed it . " Something with music and dancing , " he said . Josie racked her brains , then snapped her fingers . " I know ! I 'll do a Spanish number ! With a shawl and a big comb and castanets  --  Yes ? " Brows arched , her mouth a perfect 0 , she awaited Niles 's verdict . " Yes ! " he decreed . " Si si senor ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head , then , irresistibly , got up and , flinging her chintz skirt about , clacking her Enna Jettick shoes on the brick , fan- dangoed up the walk singing in her whisky tenor : " Lay-dee of Spain , I adore y00000 , Lay-dee of Spain , I live for y0000  --  " She leaned to a flower bed and , turning again , a blossom appeared clenched in her teeth . Faster and faster she went , her abandon exposing her rolled stockings till , too dizzy to con- tinue , she reeled out onto the lawn . " Ole , " she cried , finishing with a breathless flourish , then called " Buenos dias , Mr. Angelini , " to the handyman , who , coming from the direction The Other 139of the cider press , lugged in one hand an empty gasoline can , bound for the dump heap in the granary yard . Ada waved . " Mr. Angelini , when you have time , shall you please bring your ladder and poke down that wasp nest ? " The old Italian stopped in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group with a long look , gave no sign of having heard the request . Then he disappeared behind the barn carrying his can . Aunt Josie knocked a weathered croquet ball aside with her foot and , returning to the arbor , dropped into her chair . " I do n't think we 'll have a Spanish number after all . " She kicked off her shoes and sprawled , testing a curl for spring . " Maybe we 'll just do a tableau . I can be Whistler 's Mother and sit in a chair . That 'd be a sketch . Ooh-a , that 's a pun , dears . " While Ada became engrossed again in her work , the other ladies put their heads together and arranged themselves into a tight little symposium for purposes of gossip . Niles listened to Mrs. Jewett 's indignation over the morning headlines . Bruno Hauptmann , she was talking about . Brunoitsounded like a name for a dog . Well , Bruno Hauptmann was a dog all right . Stole the Lindbergh baby , he had . Put a ladder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window . Lots of money had been paid by Lucky Lindy to get the baby back , but when he did the baby was no longer alive . Bruno Hauptmannwas going to get the Chair . " And his lawyers are appealing again  --  think of the poor taxpayers ' money going down the drain ! " Mrs. Jewett 's red mouth was going a mile a minute . Ding-ding-ding . The Talcotts Ferry trolley stopped at Church Street , then rolled past the house , wheels clanking , bell ringing . Niles checked his time and made a minor adjustment on his Ingersoll watch . Far off in the distance could be heard the drone of an140 The Otherairplane , banking away from the airfield on its way to New York . Niles put his watch back on and buckled the strap . Lifting his head , he looked up to the street . Holland was walking along the car tracks . So he 'd been off on the trolleys again . He came casually sauntering down the lawn , kicking at the dandelions , squinting at the airplane , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pequot Landing . Soon the roar of the propellersincreased in such volume as to drown out entirely the piano music from the Rowe house next door . In another moment a tiny figure had tripped through the doorway and down the back-porch steps , a little white-haired lady who came out flourishing a red coach blanket around her head . There followed a most entertaining , if singular , performance , attentively witnessed by all eyes in the arbor , and a pair , Niles was quick to notice , outside , where Holland stood hidden by the grape leaves , the Asiatic look on his face . " Hoo-oo , " the lady called , blinking and peering up at the sky as she darted across the yard . " Hoo-oo . " With her audience half out of their chairs and watching through the grapevines , she continued prancing back and forth in a comical effort to make herself seen by the plane . Trying not to trample the begonias bordering the grass , she scurried in circles around a sundial , clockwise , counter-clockwise , the blanket flapping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plane had passed directly overhead and disappearedbeyond the trees , she stood bewildered for a moment , blanket limp at her side while she caught her breath , then , with a shrug , smoothed back a stray wisp of hair and , the blanket dragging behind , picked her way past her flower beds toward the house , pausing as she went to inspect a planting of portulaca . " Well , imagine that ! " Mrs. Jewett shook her head in The Other totwonder and watched the sprightly old lady fold the blanket , tuck it under her arm , and go inside . Presently the piano music resumed . " It ai n't Paderewski , but then I 'll bet Paderewski could n't run the 2:20 the way she does , " Aunt Josie boomed . Mrs. Jewett made certain arrangements to ease her bosom . " Such an exhibition  --  really ! A woman her age . I thought she had a serious heart condition . " " An amazing woman , " replied Aunt Josie . Which was one word for it . Mrs. Rowe , considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Valley Hill Road as a bride back before the turn of the century . Mr. Rowe had flown with Rickenbacker and , after the armistice , was one of the pioneers of commercial aviation . Thirteen years ago he had been sent by President Harding to South America to investigate the possibilities of continental flying routes . His plane crashed in the jungle and he was never seen again . The news of his death had left his widow in shock , and for several years she had seldom appeared , but after the airfield was constructedsouth of the city and the planes flew directly over Pequot Landing , coaxed out by the sound of their motors , Alice Rowe had suddenly emerged , waving her blanket as though trying to communicate with her dead husband . " Does that Mrs. Whoosis still look after her ? " Mrs. Jewett said , settled again in her chair finally . Mrs. Cooney , that would be ; Torrie said she had seen her down at the Center a few weeks ago and there had been a little  --  well , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been appearing from Mrs. Rowe 's cellar and Mrs. Cooney insistedthey came from the Perry barn . " But I told her we have n't had rats over here for years . Not since Ada got her cat and  --  " She broke off , embarrassed , and while Ada looked down at her painting Aunt Josie began talking rapidly. 142 The Other " I do n't think I 've even had a glimpse of old Mrs. Rowe in  --  years , " she said . " Look out there , Fan . " The wasp had returned and Fanny quickly lowered her veil , jumping from her chair and retreating again to the corner of the arbor . Niles laughed at the sight : Aunt Fania looked like a camp bed , all netted up against mosquitos . " Why , will you just look at that , " said Mrs. Jewett , pointing to the table where the wasp was hovering over the pitcher . In a moment it had settled on the lip , then crawled inside where it dropped into the wine , shortly to be imprisoned by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 'll get drunk , " Aunt Josie said as it pushed frantically between pieces of orange and lemon , trying to free itself . Soon it gave up and floated exhausted amidst the fruit . " Thank goodness . " Fanny breathed a sigh of relief . She undid her netting , still damp from her earlier accident , draped it over some grape leaves to dry , and went to stand behind the others , clustered at Ada 's back and chattering blithely as they enviously watched her add a deeper wash to her roses . " Oh , Sister , " Fan exclaimed , " marvelous depth you 've gotten in your petals . I do n't know how you ever got the hang of flower painting , anyway . Art certainly do n't run in our family . Never had a lesson in her life , " she boasted to Mrs. Jewett . " Well , I think it 's just wonderful . She 's an absolute La Vinci , " said Mrs. Jewett , who knew a little about art . " I ca n't draw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Niles had taken a long spoon and was fishing the unfortunate wasp from the pitcher . He poured off the excess liquid and held the insect cradled in the spoon out into the sunshine while its wings dried . " There 's no such thing in the world as a purely straight line , " Josie said . " Then perhaps there 's hope for me after all , " Mrs. Jewett said , carefully following the tip of Ada 's moistenedThe Other 143brush with her eye . " What red d'ye call that , I wonder ? " Ada explained that it was the Crimson Lake Niles had brought from the store and Mrs. Jewett said , " I think a red like that shade would suit my coloring , " and went on to explainabout a crepe de chine dress she wanted dyed for the country club dance . " Oh , and did I tell you ? When Joe goes away on his next trip "  --  Mr. Jewett was a drummer for Sherwin-Williams paints ; he often traveled to Providence , to Fall River , to Bangor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Is that so ? asked someone , what color ? Mrs. Jewett thought parrot green above with a darker color for the dado . There was silence for a spell , then Mrs. Jewett spoke again . " Imagine that poor Alice Rowe being so scared of rats . " Honestly , she went on , such a tempest in a teapot , and why did n't she set traps ? Torrie replied that Mrs. Cooney had said she was going to buy some pellets to put around for the rats to eat , hoping to get rid of them in that way . By this time the wasp 's wings had begun to flutter , and presently it heaved itself up and crawled to the lip of the iced tea spoon . " Fly away , your house is on fire , your children will burn , " Niles heard Holland whisper gleefully as his hand shot out from the sheltering grape leaves . " Damn you ! " Niles said , turning in the direction of Aunt Fan 's frightened cry . Her maline net hung drying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her in her theory , the wasp drove straight at her neck . " Oh ! Oh ! Oh ! " she cried , a volley of sharp , staccato shrieks , while one person screamed and another slapped the wasp from her flesh , and Niles quickly ran to crush it underfoot . Mrs. Jewett had backed against the table , knocking the pitcher to the flagging , where it broke , the fruit lying amidst the turf and glass , the wine leaving a darkening stain on the stonework . Aunt Fan was in an agony of cries and moans144 The Otherand while Mrs. Jewett vainly tried to help her sit down and Aunt Josie tried to draw her up the walk to the house , Ada rushed ahead to get something for the swelling and to tell Winnie to phone for the doctor ; Torrie , having gathered up Ada 's paraphernalia , quickly followed . Niles during the meantime had been trying helpfully to pick up the pieces of broken glass . Reaching for the last fragments , he found himself staring at a pair of feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You bastard , " he said , " you dirty rotten bastard . " Which was all he could think of to call him ; only he was n't really saying it , only thinking it , seeing the gable-shaped brows lifted slightly as the face peered back at him through the grape leaves , eyebrows lifted in mock innocence ( Who ? Me ? ) , thinking , Oh Holland when are you going to stop , when are you going to make it stop ! What was that he was saying ? "  --  and I want you to take it off , " he ordered . Niles rose with a blank look . " What ? " The costume , he was demanding . Niles must take it off . He was n't Professor Rabbitwaters  --  Holland was . It was his invention . The One and Only Original Professor Rabbitwaters ! " But  --  why ? " " Because I said to . " Easily ; not threatening or anything , just a simple statement . Then , with the old winning smile : " Because Professor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trick . " A trick ? What sort of trick was that ? " A gr-r-eat trick !

" " Who for ? " " Who for ? " The smile was oh so wide and oh so charmTheOther 145ing . " Why , for a sweet little old lady , that 's who . But second , I need something to pull out of the hat ! " And away he went , Holland , out from the arbor and over the lawn , cape flapping , hat on the back of his head , his laughter bright and merry as he skimmed away in the direction of the barn .

" " Harum . " ( Deep , presidential-sounding tone ; more giggles . ) " Ah  --  Mrs. Rowe ? " " Yes ? Yes , this is Mrs. Rowe speaking .

And the parade would arrive , often all the way up Church Street from the Center , for instead of tea Mrs. Rowe always served hot dogs and never seemed to mind the fact that , at the last moment , the President 's schedule had been changed or Garbo was delayedfilming . She was a gracious hostess , kind and thoughtful and remarkablein her tolerance of her guests . Nor were the hot dogs the only attraction : a wastebasket made from a hollowed-out elephant 's foot , a Grecian wine jug , a Siamese temple dancer 's headdress , the horn of a narwhal , wild animal skins , combs of mother-of-pearl , jade figures , even a real shrunken head which her small visitors might handle carefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to see Aunt Fania and left again , Mrs. Rowe had gone out to her garage for a bottle of rooting compound to start a stalk of begonia , shattered in her dash about the yard .

She picked up the injured stem and was returning to the house , passingThe Other 147the hen-and-chickens in the rock garden encircling the sundial , when something caught her eye , a figure just there behind the clump of rhododendrons at the foot of the lawn . Shading her eyes with her hand , she peered uncertainly at the shrubbery , wondering who it might be .

" she demandedstarchily . " No 'm . " A cane slipped from his hand to the grass . " What then ? What are you doing in my garden ? What do you want ? Are you up to further mischief ?

He seemed to be encountering difficulty with something or other moving inside his pink shirt . " Just a moment . " She seemed uncertain . " Now  --  see here , Holland  --  " she took a step toward him . " Perhaps  --  perhaps if you said you were sorry  --  perhaps if you could apologize , you would n't have to go . " " Yes 'm .

" Now , we 'll just pretend that other business never happened . We 'll say no more about it , shall we ? " She seemed so relieved to have it over and done with . " You 're Watson Perry 's grandson , " she said , marveling . " We went to school together , your grandfather and I , did you know that ? " She bent to him , spry and tiny and whitehaired .

" " Yes . Torrie 's married . " " Married ? That little child ? Who did she marry ? " " Rider Gannon . You know the Gannons  --  they live in the big brick house down on the green .

" No , that 's Al Gammond that drives the firetruck . " The Wooldridge house had burned to the ground a year ago Fourth of July . " Oh , " she said , musing a moment , her face clouding briefly as some unspoken wisp of thought played hide-and-seek across the meadows of her memory . She brightened again .

" " We 're going to have a show in the barn . I 'm Professor Rabbitwaters , the magician . " " A magician ! " She clapped her hands enthusiastically . " How grand . " He gave her an odd look .

" I 'm afraid I do n't have any frankfurters today , but there 's lemonade and ice cream , and I think some cake . . . " Step- ping toward the kitchen she started and gave a cry of surprise . " Oh , there 's another one ! " She pointed to a shadowy corner where a trap had been sprung by a large gray rat , its neck flattened under the heavy clamp . " Holland  --  " she said , " would you  --  " She gestured at the dead thing . " I simply ca n't bring myself to go near one . Mrs. Cooney always took care of such things .

" What should I do with it ? " " Take one of those paper bags , dear , then drop it in the garbage , would you ? " White-lipped , biting the back of her The Other 151hand , she watched him deposit the dead animal in a sack and roll up the top , pulling back in terror as he passed her and went to the garbage can at the garage door . Seeing that the rat was safely out of sight and the garbage lid replaced , she waited for him to join her and together they went through into the kitchen . " Some more lemonade , dear ? " Mrs. Rowe asked , holding out the pitcher for him . " Yes , thank you , " he said politely . They were sitting in the parlor before the empty fireplace . Casement curtains obscured the view from the street , but the afternoon sun shed a diffused light through the side windows , between heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them an enormous mirror with twining leaves and fruit and cupids duplicated the room in all its particulars , making it appear that there were four people , two white-haired smiling ladies and their guests , two serious young men in opera clothes , taking tea together  --  tea for the ladies and lemonade and cake for the young men . Lamps of colored crystal dripped flashing prisms which tinkled faintly . Dried flower clusters and bright birds were everywhere imprisoned under transparent domes . A bowl of wax fruit collected dust . Beside a marble mantel stood a glass case , its shelves cluttered with a provocative collection of mementos and curios . " Well , " said Mrs. Rowe , " is n't this nice . " She had brought out her best cup and saucer , from which she sipped as she rocked in her chair . " An unexpected surprise , which is the best kind ! And just such an afternoon . I must confess , I was longing for company  --  I miss Mary Cooney so . I always enjoy having visitors , though they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children , like yourself , Holland . I have152 The Other always thought that having the young around keeps me young myself . " " It 's nice to be here , " he offered agreeably . He could see what she said was true : her face had about it a certain little-girl quality . In a second his gaze had drifted again to the glass case , which had captured his interest . His eyes search- ing the shelves , he mechanically reached into a pocket , re- moved the harmonica , and began a song . Nyang-gang-ga-dang-dang ding-ding ga-dang-dang-dang  --  " Why , are n't you clever , " said Mrs. Rowe . " I used to play the cello years ago ; what is that ditty ? " " Oh , it 's just  --  nothing  --  a nursery rhyme . " He sang a few lines to her : " How many miles to Babylon ? Threescore miles and ten  --  Can I get there by candlelight ?

All the best sword steel comes from Toledo . You may take it out if you care to . I know how young boys enjoy things like that . " He got up and , laying the harmonica on one of the glass shelves , removed the sword from the case , inspected it , then took up an ivory comb and held it to the light . " That came from Peking , China , " she explained . " See how fragile it is . And that glass ball is from Prague , in Czechoslo- vakia . Are n't you warm with that cape ? Why do n't you just slip it off  --  that 's better . My , spats and all , I declare . Such a The Other r S3pretty shirt . I love pink , it 's so  --  Are you quite comfortable , Holland ?

" No 'm  --  I 'm fine , " he said , still fiddling at his side . " Say , " he continued , as though the thought had just struck him , " would you like to see me do my trick now ? " Though the blush had faded , his expression was alight with expectation . " A trick ? Ah , you want to sing for your supper , is that it ? " " No , not sing . Do a trick . I want to do a trick for you . " He looked at her anxiously . " Why , that would be very nice . " She sat forward in her chair as he slid into his cape again and made a circuit of the room , lifting in turn each of the portieres from their glass tiebacksand letting them fall across the windows . " Oh my , " she said with the slightest trepidation as the room grew dim , " is that necessary ? " " It 's a better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and returned to take up a position before her . " Oh , very mysterious , is it ? All magicians are misterioso , are n't they ? Would this be a card trick ? " " Oh no . Card tricks are for kids . This is a grown-up trick . " Turning his back to her , he made certain arrangements which , though she failed to grasp their import , did not fail to pique her curiosity . At length he faced her again . Her eyes bright with anticipation , her hands folded comfortably in her lap , she observed as he removed his silk hat and held it in front of him , tipping it upside down and tapping it in the tradition of all magicians , to prove its bonafide emptiness . " Professor Rabbitwaters , " he announced dramatically , " will now pull something from his hat ! " z54 The Other " Heavens , " she said , leaning forward still further from her chair , " something from his hat ! Will it be a rabbit ? " " Not exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his red mouth , and though she laughed , a tinkling crescendo endingin a little grace note of disbelief , he made no other reply but went straightaway about his business , performing abracadabraand hocus-pocus , using his eyes strangely to divert her attention from his hands , moving adroitly beneath the cape , and then , his grin ever-widening , answering her eager smile , he stepped briskly forward one more step and , without further ado , performed his trick . VHot . Getting hotter . By day and by night , summer bloomed , blazed . The horsechestnuttree became a darker green , its leaves broadening , glistening with a leathery , waxy sheen , its branches sprouting small prickly balls . The lawns , however , sprouted only dandelions , crabgrass , and witchweed . Awnings were useful . While certain people returned , sorrowfully , to the city , others arrived to enjoy the blandishments of the country . Some loved the weather , some endured it , some suffered from it .

So saith Mr. Crofut , the mailman , blowing his whistle every half-block along the Valley Hill Road to announce his coming . " T'ai n't the heat , it 's the humidity . " That was another of Mr. Crofut 's sagacious , oftrepeatedobservations . And folks all over Pequot Landing were feeling it . Mr. Pretty , the vegetable man , wiped his red face with a bandana and rang his cowbell from the cab of his truck and waved at Mr. Klepper the seafood man , who shouted " Fish ! " at the top of his lungs and wished he had more ice . Mr. Swate , the Congregational church sexton , rake in one hand , a wateringcan in the other , paused at his labors over a grave and cursed the thermometer , softly , not to shame those underfoot . Mrs. Jewett , her husband being in Providence or Fall River or Bangor , was having the sunporch painted , and her house smelled of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beeches and put a newspaper over her head . Rose Halligan , whose day off from the Ten Cent Store it was , boarded the Center Street trolley uptown to take in an aircooleddouble feature . Mr. Pennyfeather , being taken for a walk by Mrs. Pennyfeather , he in seersucker , she in a pongee dress and a barrette to keep her hair out of her face , strolled along the sidewalk and said hello to Mrs. Joacum , digging worms from her front grass . Mr. Angelini pushed the lawnmower  --  cleckcleckcleckcleck  --  arounda square of lawn behind the Perry house while  --  snip . . . snip . . . snip  --  in the rose garden beside the carriage-house , Niles was clipping Granddaddy'sEmperor roses . Snip . The steel nippers of the rose shears were shining and sharp ; they parted a stem neatly and Niles made a deft catch before156 The Otherthe flower hit the ground . But today his mind was elsewhere . On magicking , to be precise . There was this trick  --  snip  --  the one he had envisioned for the show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , particularly with Aunt Josie being gone , and he mulled over in his mind how this feat might best be accomplished . Snip . Carrying a sizable bouquet , he went to replace the redhandledrose shears on their nail next to Father 's hip boots hanging on the wall of the tool shed . All of Mr. Angelini 's tools had blue-crayoned outlines around them , indicating their proper spaces . At a sound , he looked through the door to the breezeway , where he saw the hired man , standing back in the shadows , regarding him silently . " Hi , Mr. Angelini . " Under the battered straw hat , there was a strange look in the dark , red-rimmed eyes . Then , tentatively , the man raised his arm in salute and let it fall to his side . " It 's all right , Mr. Angelini , " Niles said , stepping across the threshold with his flowers , reaching to touch the old man 's sleeve . " It was n't your fault . It 'll be all right . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Scusa me , " heaved a sack of fertilizer into a wheelbarrow and stumbled away . Wonderful odors wafted forth from the kitchen : Winnie was baking one of her marble cakes . " Wipe yore feet ! " Her familiar chant ended in a rising inflection warning of dire consequences . " I did , " Niles hastened to assure her , the screen door clattering behind him as he stepped over a basketful of root beer bottles and left a trail of grass cuttings across the linoleum to the sink . At her ironing board , Winnie shook a woeful head . For how many years had she tried to train Perry kidsThe Other ' 57not to track up her floor ? Fall , leaves ; winter , snow ; spring , mud ; summer , half the lawn , natcherly . " Where you been ? " she asked amiably , over the bleat of her radio program . " Oh , around , " he informed her . Enormously edified , she watched him lay the roses on the drainboard , pull out a cabinet drawer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cupboard . " What 're you doin '  --  yore grandmother'sgood vase ! If you put them roses onto the piano , put a saucer under . Honest . " " They 're not for the piano , they 're for Mother . " Dragging a chair to the sink , he busied himself with the faucet . " Niles , what 're you doin ' there ? " " Washing off the bugs . " " Bugs ? " " There 's lots of June bugs this year and  --  " She rolled her eyes heavenwards . " Oh God , in my sink . " " When 's lunch ? " " When 's it ever ? " " Noon . " " All right , sir . ' S'not eleven , yet . " " What 's to eat ? " " Croquettes . " " Cro-quettes ? Wow ! " She marveled at the amount of water he managed to spatter over the vicinity . " What 's for supper ? " " How can you be thinkin ' about supper when you ai n't had yore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 's today ? " " Friday . " " Then what 's for supper ? " /58 The Other " Oh . Fish . Shad ?

" " If anybody 's around to eat it , that is . " " Why ? " " ' Cause it 's Friday , that 's why  --  yore uncle 's got American Legion , I got Jennie to visit , you got choir practice , and yore mother 's got no appetite , so that leaves Missus to eat the haddock . " " It 's okay  --  a full stomach makes me burp . And if I burp I ca n't sing so good and Professor Lapineaux makes cracks . " He had gone to produce a box of Sunshine biscuits from the drawer of the Hoosier cabinet , and was munching . Winnie carefully folded a shirt and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it on top of the refrigerator , where a Gothic-shaped radio sat , at all hours rivaling the Atwater-Kent in the parlor , the larger one most regularly broadcasting Amos ' n ' Andy weekdays at seven on the Red Network , the smaller competing with Easy Aces on the Blue . " Fish is good for the brain , they say , " Winnie pointed out as she deftly maneuvered the nose of her iron around the buttonson a pair of pants . " Not that you need more , if you 'd use what God had the grace to give you . Ni-YULS ! Get that monster out of my kitchen ! " With the most angelic of faces , he picked up the chameleon he had placed on a carton in the open Hoosier , hoping to see it turn blue or yellow . He dropped it down his front and got back on the chair to stick the roses one by one in the vase . " Niles , angel , why 'd you use that chair ? " It was a Hitchcockarrowback , and an antique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he told her , as if she could n't see . " Who 'd of guessed . But you 're more than tall enough to reach the faucets without  --  " She appealed to her God . " Lord , how them kids treat the things in this house  --  I swear the Salem rocker 's going to fall apart , the way it 's treated . " " Did Buffalo Bill really sit in that rocker ? " " Beats me . I ai n't that old . " Old or not , she had been there in her kitchen domain since before he and Holland were born ; Winnie , her homely face continually flushed from heat or exertion , always puffing , her coiled braids casting a constant trail of pins as she lumbered about , fluffing , dusting , plumping , wiping , buffing , paring , mending , washing , cooking . " What 're you doing ? " she demanded as , pushing his rear end out , he pranced about on the wooden chair seat in time with the music . " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ See  --  ? " " Quit ! " A sergeant 's order . Her perspiring face waled like corduroy with ribs of consternation , she turned off the radio and whisked him from the chair with a sturdy arm . " Yore sister did n't teach you no dancing on no antique chairs . " With little time for talking , Winnie chose rather to holler , as though communicating with the deaf or foreign-tongued . Setting him down , she pinned her braids more securely and blew out her cheeks exasperatedly as Ada came in from the front hall , a bundle of bedding in her arms . " I 've stripped all the beds but Alexandra 's , when you have time , " she said , handing the bundle to Winnie , who chucked it into the back-entryway . Just then an oven timer went off , and Niles , in his deepest Amos ' n ' Andy voice said , " Buzz me , Miz Blue . " " Oh God , I fergot my cake  --  I hope it ai n't burned . " Winnie grabbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Other The Other t 61linoleum quaking beneath her tread . She opened the door of the range , flapped at the hot maw with her apron to shoo the heat , removed two cake tins , and placed them on a damp towel on the porcelain-topped table . She snatched at a slipstrapas she produced an additional pan of cupcakes , and turned the gas off . " Lord , it 's hot . Think I might just run a couple of these extras over to Mrs. Rowe 's when they cool . " " I do n't imagine she 's eating too good , with Mrs. Cooney gone , " Ada said , counting rubber canning rings from the drawer of the Hoosier . Winnie unplugged her iron , lugged the board out to the back-entryway , then returned , puffing , to bear away the laundry , tripping over the basket of filled root beer bottles as she dashed out to catch the fish man . " Niles , child , " Ada said , " that root beer will never ferment if it do n't get out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 'll cook in no time . How come you always like a lot of lemon in your root beer ? " " Because I do not care for the taste of root beer . " " Try sarsaparilla , why do n't you ? " " Here all the sarsaparilla is too much bubbles . They hurt my nose . I do n't think sarsaparilla is good for people . " " Holland likes it . " " We all have our likes , " she said , her look rather severe . " And shall you please get your bicycle out of the way before your uncle drives in and runs over it . " Niles sighed . Why was he always the one to catch it ? " That 's not my bike , it 's Holland 's . Mine 's got a flat . And anyway , Uncle George 's got Legion , so he wo n't be driving in . But I 'll move it , " he said , catching her warning look . " Ada ? Did Buffalo Bill really sit in the Salem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is a most historic chair . " " Why did he come here ? " " He was here with his Wild West show . Up at Charter Oak Park . Before you boys were born . " " Yes , but what was he doing here ? " " In the house ? Why , he was a friend of Granddaddy Perry 's , I believe . They had the same dentist , which was how they became acquainted . It became a tradition for the two men to get together . Your Granddaddy was a great believer in tradition . He had many famous friends . Mark Twain and Buffalo Bill and Mrs. Stowe . " Yes , certainly , the lady writer . Why , she exclaimed , you never would have known Daddy Perry was the Onion King . A farmer ? Nonsense ; he loved wearing spats , and in the summer he always had a bachelor button in his lapel . Oh , the pride in his roses . Pride and tradition , that was Daddy Perry . Was that why he gave the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , he gave the money because he had a generous spirit . And after Grandmother went away  --  well , never mind that . But the Memorial Dinner was given every year in his name because he thought about other people as well as his own family . Not a public demonstration , by any means , but a private ritual , honoring the generosityof one kind man . " And that 's why we get to drink the toast too , " he said , " ' cause we 're his grandsons , Holland and me , and we believe in tradition too , " and went out through the swinging door bearing away the silver vase filled with roses for Mother , with Ada calling after , reminding him to lay out the root beer bottles in the sun . " Darling , they 're beautiful , " Alexandra said when he had carried the roses to her room . Chin in hand , she was sitting in162 The Other the chintz-covered chair with the copy of Anthony Adverse on her lap . " Twelve hundred pages  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've so been looking forward to read- ing it . " It pleased him when she said that ; she looked forward to so little any more . Mother would enjoy her book , and that was good , he thought , putting the roses on her dressing table and turning the vase to advantage . It seemed to him her mind was elsewhere today ; she was more restive , her face looked strained under the bright spots of color on her cheeks , and the eyes more melancholy , with faint circles beneath ; when she dropped her lids he saw that their edges had a bluish cast . " It 's twelve hundred and twenty-four pages . But you 're a fast reader . Miss Shedd says once you start , you wo n't put it down . " He took the book from her and , seated on the dressing table stool , read a page or two aloud . " What is it ? " he asked , pausing to look up at the moth-pale smile that crossed her face . " I was just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to read to you boys . Every month , when Good Housekeeping came , Martin Johnson 's story about Africa  --  Martin and  --  what was his wife 's name ? " " Osa . " He closed the book on his thumb . " Osa , yes . You both thought that was such a funny name for a lady hunter . And there was Tom the Water Baby  --  " Niles giggled . " And Wampus Tommy . " " Wampus Tommy ? I do n't remember him . " " Ada used to read it to us . He was a cat . " " Cat ? " She frowned at the thought and lightly put her fingertips to her eyes . " I remember Piggy Look-a-doo . He got roasted with an apple in his mouth , poor greedy thing . One of Holland 's favorites , was n't it ? " " No  --  that 's the changeling , remember ? In the fairytale book ? " " The changeling ? Oh , what a horrid story ! How could that be anybody 's favorite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where she lifted the curtain and gazed down at the arbor , one hand raised to her breast as though feeling for her heartbeat . " Poor Aunt Fanuschka , it 's sad that she came all the way up here only to get stung by a bee . " " Wasp  --  it was a wasp , " Niles said , picking up the photograph of the poverty party , smiling at Father in his dress and rubber hip boots . " Yes dear , a wasp . And of all people , with all the pains she took . " It was pitiful . As soon as they had gotten Aunt Fania into the house , Dr. Brainard had been called , but all his shots and pills were unavailing , her whole body swelled up , her hearing had been affected ; finally she was removed to Harkness Pavilion in New York , where Aunt Josie , who had to get back to the photography studio , could be near her . With a sigh , Alexandra sat again ; she reached across Niles to take up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Here , play with these . " He picked up the three sliced pieces of tan-colored bean he had bought for her and laid them gently in her hand , where they proceeded to dance around . " They 'll jump more if you warm them , " he explained . " Each one 's got a little worm inside  --  a moth larva . That 's what makes them move . " He closed her fist over the jumping beans and squeezed it tight . " Goodness , is that how it 's done ? Where do you learn all these things ? Certainly they do n't teach you about jumping beans in school . " " It 's not a bean , it 's a seed . It tells all about them on one of the Chautauqua rolls . " Abruptly her head lifted . " Mother  --  what is it ? " She was looking at him so peculiarly . " Chautauqua , " sher64 The Othermused ; a brief flicker of her lids , and her expression altered , quick as a flash . He cleared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Something unspoken hung in the air . He was waiting for something .. . " Are you okay ? " " Yes . Surely , dear . Ada 's Chautauqua  --  it 's a mine of information , is n't it ? I 'd forgotten . " She drummed her nails on the crocheted runner on the dressing table . She opened her mouth , closed it , compressed her lips . Her smile seemed to him exhausted . " Darling , " she said brightly , " had n't you better be outdoors , playing ? I 'm not sure you should be reading that book anyway . " " What did Mrs. Stowe write ? " " Harriet Beecher Stowe ? Why , Uncle Tom 's Cabin . You remember that . Liza crossing the ice , and Simon Legree ? " " Yes . " " I recall once when we were sitting right here  --  you and I and Holland  --  we were reading that book and you looked at me very innocently and said , Mother , what did you do in the Civil War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he laughed , trying to instill in her some of his own mirth ; but she only laid her head back and closed her eyes . " Mother ? " " Yes dear ? " " Are you all right ? " " Yes dear . " " Want me to read some more to you ? " " No dear . " But she caught him before he could start away , and pressed his hand . He scrutinized her face , saw the fluttering hand , feverish , indecisive , somehow poignant . It was something about the tobacco tin , he felt sure . Yes , that was it ; Holland'sThe Other 165secret . No , she did n't really want to ask ; not really . Prince Albert , was n't it ? Very lightly , hardly mentioning the matter . The kind Father smoked ? Oh , she was foolish , her eyes were playing tricks . He knew what she must be thinking . Oh Mother , Mother darling . . . how he wished he could help . We help by understanding . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understood . She had the jumping beans between her palms and was rubbing them briskly together , rubbing her thought away . " I 'm silly  --  you 've got a silly mother , and there you have it . When you go down , dear , tell Victoria to be sure to take her tonic . She 's sitting in the arbor . Dear Victoria , you are doing a terriblething to me , making me a grandmother . Perhaps it will be twins  --  they do run in families , they say . " Niles shook his head . " No , it 's going to be just one and it 'll be a girl . " " Wizard , " she said , taking a playful tone . In the distance a bell sounded . " Here comes Mr. Pretty , " Niles said . " Did he really used to be the iceman ? " " Before you were born , when we had an icebox . " " Now we have a Kelvinator . " " So does half the town ; which is why Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reminds me  --  I have a new joke for you . " " Do you , dear ? " " Yes . " He giggled in anticipation ; a ritual . " Ready ? " She put on a proper listening face . " Yes , darling , I 'm ready . " " Do you know the one about the mouse in the refrig-erator ? " " No , I do n't think so . " " Well , it seems there was this lady who went to her re-166 The Other The Other r67frigerator and when she opened the door she found a mouse lying on top of the butterplate . So she said to the mouse , What are you doing in my refrigerator ? ' And the mouse said , Is n't this a Westinghouse ? ' And the lady said yes and the mouse said , Well , I 'm westing . ' " " Oh Niles . " She took his hand and squeezed it again , as if that slight pressure could , of itself , elicit the response she sought . He saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knew , she would try to laugh it off , as always , would try to keep from crying , from causing the least scene , the least distress . Oh Mother , Mother  --  come with me . Come into the parlor and play the piano . You and me , while Holland 's gone . Duets . " I Hear as in a Dream " from The Pearl Fishers , or " Country Gardens . " Mother , seated at the keyboard , elegant , slipping the flashing rings from her fingers , nails clicking like scarlet beetles on the keys . No ; it was out of the question ; she was frightened . He gave her back her hands . They wilted into her lap as if possessing no life of their own . He kissed her and bid her goodbye , closing the door part way when he went out . In a while she got up and opened the scarf drawer ; the bottle she brought out was empty . Hearing a step , she replaced it and quickly resumed her chair . Winnie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here 's clean sheets and pillowcases for you , Mrs. Alex , " she said , perspiring from climbing the stairs . " I 'll be back to change yore bed . " " Thank you , Winnie , " she said , helping her sort the linen from a pile of fresh laundry . " Honestly , this shirt of Holland 's is practically a rag by now . Look how the sleeves are frayed . Ca n't you make a dustcloth of it ? People will think we 're poorer than we are . " " Oh , I would n't do that , Mrs. Alex , " Winnie protested . " I would n't dare do nothing with it . " " All right , Winnie . I suppose . Thank you . " " I got to get down and see to some vegetables . I heard P. C. 's cowbell . Anything special you 'd care for ?

I 'll cut it for you and Ada can put it on the machine . No , I insist . A little present from me to you . And Winnie , while you 're down there , just stop next door for me  --  please ? have corn-on-the-cob for dinner , if P. C. has any nice Golden Bantam . Just leave those things on the bed , I 'll put them away for you . No , no trouble . I have n't been in the boys ' room in  --  why , it must be ages . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She was left then , alone , staring at the pieces of tan seed leaping in her warm hand , erratically and to no purpose , activated by no apparent force ; and the warmer her hand grew , the more insane became their movement , insistently , aggravatinglynonsensical , like the answer to the question that kept jumping in her mind. 1 68 The OtherVI6 , lYJI ornin ' , Niles , " the vegetable man called as the boy came through the back-entryway , lugging an apple basket filled with quart bottles , their dark amber liquid and bright brass caps winking in the sun . Thursday , when Ada took the streetcar up to the city for Russian Orthodox services , was always root beer night ( Rose Rock provided George with sarsaparilla and ginger ale , but no root beer , everybody 's favorite ) and each morning for the next week the capped bottles had to be distributed on the grass to ferment . " Hi , Mr. Pretty , " Niles called back as he quickly laid out the bottles in spiral formation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hitting Winnie 's portly figure as she emerged . " Ya missed me , kiddo , " she said , then turned to greet the beaming Mr. Pretty . " Mornin ' , P. C. How 's for some Golden Bantam t'day ? " Mr. Pretty polished up a cucumber on the bib on his overalls . " Sorry , Winnie , " he said , munching . " Jerry had to go up to Hazardville with a load of turnip . Corn wo n't get picked until this afternoon . I can come back if ya like . " Winnie looked dubious . " Mrs. Alex asked special . What else ya got ? " The Other 169 " Swiss chard 's nice t'day . " Niles sauntered over , making a face . " Swiss chard  --  ick . Tastes like dandelion greens . " " Let me have about a peck , P. C. And you 'd better come back with the corn , I guess . Mrs. Alex do n't ask for things often . " " Say , dandelion greens , " P. C. said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yore neighbor-lady , Miz Rowe  --  she gone away or somethin ' ?

" " Not hide nor hair . Usually Miz Cooney boils her up a mess of tripe Fridays and I bring her some dandelion greens . I knocked and rang , but I could n't raise a soul . " " You knew she 'd left , Mrs. Cooney ? " Mr. Pretty was measuring out the greens under Niles 's baleful stare . " Yep . She come out to say goodbye to me before she went . Reckon how Miz Rowe misses her . I do n't think Miz Rowe 's such a good housekeeper . You ca n't believe the smell over there . " " Smell ? " Mr. Pretty 's eyes were huge . " You 'd swear somethin ' up and died . " " Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " P. C. scratched doubtfully . " Here , here 's a couple cukes for ya . On the house .

She do n't complain . " Jennie Koslowsky had rheumatic fever and every170 The OtherFriday Winnie used her night off to take the streetcar out Babylon way to visit her . " Niles , angel , fish in my purse for P. C. , wouldja ? " Niles ran to take from her apron pocket the worn change purse he and Holland had given her four birthdays ago . " You can pay for the corn now . " " How much , Mr. Pretty ? " " Well , lessee . How many corn , Winnie  --  dozen and a half ears ? Sixteen times five is eighty and a quarter for the Swiss chard ought to do it , no charge for cukes , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some parsley , too , it 's on the house . " " No , that 's your mother 's five dollars , " Winnie told Niles , " give P. C. the dollar bill and find him a nickel , angel . " She marched inside , her plump brown arms garnished like Sunday roasts with the Swiss chard , cucumbers , and parsley . " S'long , P. C. , much obliged . Wipe yore feet ! " she loudly cautioned as Niles popped in after her . In a moment he reappeared , running to the vegetable man with a frosty pop bottle from the refrigerator . " Here , Mr. Pretty , have a root beer  --  it 's on the house . " " Why , thanks , Niles . " As the boy uncapped it with the opener on his jackknife , Mr. Pretty squeezed himself back into the cab of his truck . " I 'll return the bottle when I come back later , " he shouted with a cheery bob of his red face , amid a salvo of backfires , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he circled the pump and coaxed it up the drive , awning flapping , scales banging , and , swinging wildly at the rear bumper , the red kerosene lantern he used as a taillight . Niles went to move apart several bottles that were touchingand might possibly explode in the sun . He kicked aimlessly at the dandelions in the grass , swung his arms loosely in their sockets , shrugged . Took a stick and whacked awhile at the baby horse chestnuts . Traced his finger on the fading ringsThe Other 171of the target Father had painted on the trunk . Threw the stick as far as he could . Got bored . Looked around for something else to do . Phew , it was hot . He ambled over to the pump , pushed the handle , took a drink . He wiped the bitter copper taste from his mouth and hung the cup in its accustomed place . Then he filled the pool under the spout , put his hand over the drain , and watched where the water formed a face for him  --  not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ada was calling through the screen door . She pointed at the bike , still in the drive . " Okay . " He rolled it under the tree and leaned the saddle against the trunk . Holland 's Reddy Racer , red , black , and chrome , with a kickstand , a wire basket , a rack behind , and instead of a bell , a klaxon . He pressed the heel of his hand on the plunger : Hahroogahr ! it sounded . Where had Holland gotten to now ? Where , for that matter , was everybody ? Anybody ? Torrie was n't in the arbor , as Mother said ; he could hear her over the way , laughing with Mrs. Joacum . Mr. Angelini ? The mower had been abandoned in the middle of the lawn , but of the hired man , not a trace . The heavy air was saturated with the sour odor of grass cuttings . A katydid sang in the elm out front . Winnie had her radio on again . Mr. Crofut 's whistle sounded . July was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left . Just plain boring . If you did n't go to the seashore or to camp , you were bored . Holland did n't want to go to camp , and with Father dead and Mother the way she was , who , Niles wondered , would take them to the seashore ? Meanwhile , suffer . T'ai n't the heat , it 's the humidity . Well , there was one refuge sure to be cool  --  the icehouse. 172 The OtherHe trotted across the drive and under the breezeway . He ran through the granary yard and past the dump heap , where Mr. Angelini had stuck his empty gasoline can . It lay on top of the pile , radiating heat . Taking the slope past the wagon room in a series of bounds , Niles dashed into the buttery meadow , arms flung from his sides in imitation of airplane wings , palms skimming the tops of the grass , golden skin flashing below his shorts . Avoiding the road , he cut through the grass , leaping and whooping and hollering around the blackberry bushes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clumps of briars , the long whips of wild roses , down to the river . The icehouse was fronted by big doors , warped and wide enough for a wagon . Leaning against one , he let his weight swing it inward . The interior was cool and dim ; sun through the ruined roof sketched in beams , rafters , scaffolding ; through the giant hole in the platform flooring , where the blocks of ice used to be hauled up , the river was a lake of murky green . Cattailsclustered at the bank , sausages skewered on slender wands . Removing his sneakers , Niles waded kneedeep into the water . A flat bug skittered across its surface , spidery legs tracing intricate geometric patterns behind . Slippery gray mud at the bottom oozed between his toes ; he gripped for balance as he edged along a narrow shelf and reached out to break the stalks of the rushes . With a goodly harvest , almost more than he could manage , he footed his way back along the mud shelf to the loading platform . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belly beside them , head hanging over the platform edge , eyes staring meditatively down at the water . It was pleasant there in the shadows . It smelled of coolness , like a fern garden ; like the well once had before they sealed it up . From upside down , one piling , gloved with green algae and slime , and larger than the rest , seemed to rear back as though resisting the grayThe Other 173mud that mired it . He squinted , looked hard , saw : primordial ooze , spawning strange beings down below , a race of quasilunged , half-legged creatures dragging themselves along the bottom ; a world sunless , gloomy , nocturnal , where sunken logs lay , sodden and heavy , poor dead drowned things , and with them , hidden in the murk , savage bloated creatures , mouths wide as shovels , thick lips nuzzling threads of waterwhitenedganglia , picking clean of flesh skeletons through whose empty eye-sockets coldly glowing eels wound like night trains , while overhead , through the ruined roof , pterodactyls soared the vacant sky . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just past the icehouse , where the sycamore trunk tilted out over the water , was a clear deep pool , perfect for swimming . At the tip of the tree a small platform of planks had been nailed as a crude diving structure ; girdling its middle was a frayed rope used for climbing onto the platform . Toes curled around the sawed wooden edges , the sun hot on his naked skin , Niles stood poised for a moment , then dived . The water felt deliciously cool as his body sliced through it . He stayed under and opened his eyes . A shoal of silvery minnowsdarted by , clumps of weeds danced , pebbles gleamed whitely . Blowing air from his lungs , he left a trail of bubbles as he gradually sank to the bottom . He bent his knees , pushed off , and with a rush shot to the surface , exploding halfway out of the water . His feet touched bottom and he stood , arms akimbo , lookingover at the bank . Something moved behind the bushes . He whistled a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Threescore miles and ten  --  174 The Other And smiled when , out of the bushes , came the answer : Can I get there by candlelight ? Yes , and back again . Holland stepped around the shrubbery and stood at the water 's edge , a broad smile on his face . " Hi ! " " Hi ! " " Where 've you been ? " " No place . " " You been down to the train tracks ? " " Nope . " " Didja go up to Knobb Street ? " " Nope . " " Packard Lane ? " Holland shook his head and Niles , out of guesses , sighed . He knew where he 'd been all right : Babylon , end of the line . " C'm on in , " he called to his twin , standing at the bank . Holland shucked off his clothes and in a moment was leaping at him in the water . Niles threw himself backward out of his path , submerged , then surfaced , his wet hair whipping a fan of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the shallows and swam across to the small sandbar just breaking the river 's surface . Holland threw himself after and flopped down beside him . Panting , Niles gave himself up to the caress of the sun , the cool smoothness of the stones beneath his back , the bright dancing spots beneath his eyelids . " Hot , " he heard Holland murmur . Niles opened his eyes . Against the sky his twin 's face looked saturnine , satanic almost , as he shot Niles one of his oblique looks and then , with a lazy half-smile of contentment , closed his own eyes . JThere 's that secret smile again . What was it , this thing that amused Holland so , this past week or more ? What is it ? Say . Tell me . No , you wo n't  --  you never do , have , will . It was n't fair . They had come from the same cell , had lived nine months curled around one another . They should have already learned each other 's secrets . And he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way it was supposed to be with twins ? The Gemini , Castor and Pollux ? I already told you all my secretsallof them . But you keep yours , you hide them . Miserly , sly , secretive Holland , angry half the time , indifferent the rest ; twins are supposed to be together , are n't they ? Are n't they ? He felt overcome ; the old , sad feeling , that longing for  --  what ? He could not tell . Fugitive tremors ran through his body , along his limbs , vague yearnings assailed him ; again the Shadow Hills came to mind . He tried to picture them . Nothing . His brain groped ; what was it ? Something he had forgotten ? Never learned ? Was it a taste , a smell , a place ? Babylon  --  end of the line ? What was at the end of the line ? Flinging an arm across his eyes , he slid off the sandbar and floated , while beneath his eyelids an image hovered : a figure lying there in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest hinged back . Father . . . Father . . . He idled in the water . " What d' you suppose it 's like to be dead ? " " Jeeze , if you 're dead , you 're dead . That 's all . It 's like nothing . They put you in a box , paint your face up to look like you 're alive , but only asleep . Then they shovel out a hole and lay you in it and that 's all . " " But if you 're dead , you 've got to go someplace  --  heaven or hell or some place . " Holland hooted . " Who believes that stuff anyway ? It 's just grown-ups ' talk for Sunday school . " 176 The Other " But you 've got to go somewhere , do n't you ? " Niles thought some more . He lay back in the water , watching first the sky  --  clouds scarcely more than a ruffle , like lace on a petticoat under the wide blue skirt  --  then dropping his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last thing you 'd like to see before you die ? " " Hm ? " " The last thing . If there was one very last thing you could wish to see before you died , what would you pick ? Like  --  a sunset ? A person ? The ocean ? What ? " Holland sniggered . " Listen , if I was dying , I 'd be too busy doing just that to be looking at sunsets . And so would you . " Floating vertically , his feet lightly touching the sandy bottom , Niles turned and looked across the water to some cows ruminating in the meadow below the Avalon ridge . " I 'd wish to see her , " he said . " A cow ? " Holland had a fit . Niles shook his head and smiled . No , he meant the Angel of the Brighter Day , he explained , his tone serious . The Angel was the last thing he would wish to see . He conjured her up , her hair hanging about her shoulders , shining white wings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lily .. . bearing him away to Paradise .. . " How d' you know she would n't take you to hell ? " " Angels do n't go to hell . Only bad people do . " " The devil was an angel once , and he went to hell . " " Lucifer ? He went to hell because he was evil . " Niles was treading water , his head partially submerged ; under a darkened fringe of wet hair on his forehead his eyes shone bright across the glistening water . " You know what that is , do n't you ? " he asked mildly . " What ? Evil ? Evil is bad , that 's all . " " And an evil person is someone who does bad things . " The Other 177 " I guess . I never stopped to think about it . " Holland obvi- ously preferred another subject . " I 've been thinking about the show . " " What about it ? " Niles swam back to the sandbar . " If we 're going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light down in the apple cellar . Those cattails are too dry now to use matches . We 'll have to get a lantern , hang it somewhere ; it 'll give enough light . " " Where 'll we get a lantern ? " Holland thought for a time , but did n't reply . Then he said , " Have you thought any more about the trick ? " " Yes . " " And ? " Niles knew what he was getting at . " Well  --  " he began lamely . " It wo n't work , will it ? " " Yes it will . The only problem is to make the cabinet  --  " Holland chuckled . " Niles Alexander , you 've forgotten something . " Had he ? What ? He was sure he 'd figured it all out , Chan Yu 's disappearing trick . He could n't think " You forgot . How can the two of us get in the cabinet ? " Ohh . Dumb stupid Niles . Well , he had n't planned on two . He 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to figure out Chan Yu 's trick that he 'd be the one to perform it . But no ; Holland had other ideas , was shaking his head again . " You 're forgetting something else , too  --  it still wo n't work . " " Wo n't ? Why wo n't it ? " " Because of the Slave Door . Remember ? No ? C'm'on . Put your clothes on . I 'll show you . " It was called the Slave Door because , years ago , before the Civil War , when Connecticut had been the first to go aboli-178 The Othertionist , Great-Grandfather Perry had passed runaway slaves through it : men and women , children even , sequestered in safety until they could be sent on their way via the undergroundrailway to freedom in Canada . Holland leaned against the wall opposite and said , " Now . Look at me , Niles Alexander . What else have you forgotten ? " Niles did n't know . " Think . Suppose we build the platform over the trapdoor , say we drop down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that point . Then what ? " " Then we jump off the mattresses , change costume , go out the door , run upstairs and appear in the audience . " " What do we do ? " Holland was forcing him to think . " We run  --  out  --  the --  " He deflated audibly . There it was , staring him in the face . He was looking right at it . The padlock . Because of Uncle George 's orders , a stout padlock and chain secured the hasp and staple , rendering the Slave Door useless . And the key was in Uncle George 's pocket . Without it , there was no other way out . Holland flashed a triumphant smile . " All right now , " he said , like an officer taking command of a sinking vessel , " come along , " and he ran back up the stairs . He raised the trapdoor and looked down into the cellar . " Listen , I can do it , " he said eagerly . " I know how to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Niles looked down . All that snow . Snow in July , for the Winter Kingdom of the Akaluks . The shredded cattails lay in soiled drifts , sinking into corners , forming a downy carpet underfoot , bits flurrying upward , swirling snowflakes carried by the air currents . Against the cellar 's whitewashed walls the banks of pale stuff made it seem as if a snowstorm had blown in through the trap . The Other 179 " How ? How will we make it work ? " His voice was disappointed . " Holland  --  ? " " Hmm ? " " It is n't going to be any fun , is it ? " " What  --  the show ? Sure it will . I toldja  --  I 've got it all figured out . I know where we can get the lantern . All we need is a Chinese mustache , and a hammer and a saw to build the cabinet . " " Where will we get the lantern ? " " Well , " said Holland with a wicked roll of his eyes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Niles guessed , not wanting at all to go through with the show , yes , he 'd have to wait and see .. . VIIHere 's July in Connecticut . Here 's the whole of Pequot Landing , stupefied in its post-prandial torpor .

" " Now go to sleep . " " Can I read ? I 'm not sleepy . " " Sure . Read your new book , hon , until you get tired . " ' Thanks , Mommy . " " Good night , hon. " " Good night . " Chris blew her a kiss from the door and then closed it . She walked down the stairs . Kids ! Where do they get their ideas ! She wondered if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , come on , that 's dumb . Regan knew only that Chris had filed . Yet Howard had wanted it . Long separations . Erosion of ego as the husband of a star . I Ic 'd found someone else . Regan did n't know that . Oh , quit all this amateur psycho- analyzing and try to spend a little more time with her ! Back to the study . The script . Chris read . Halfway through , she saw Regan coining toward her . " Ili , honey . What 's wrong ? " " There 's these real funny noises , Mom . " " In your room ? " " It 's like knocking . I ca n't go to sleep . " 4  --  Where the hell are those traps ! " Honey , sleep in my bedroom and I 'll see what it is . " Chris led her to the bedroom and tucked her in . " Can I watch TV for a while till I sleep ? " " Where 's your book ? " " I ca n't find it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Chris tuned in a channel on the bedroom portable . " Loud enough ? " " Yes , Mom . " " Try to sleep . " Chris turned out the light and went down the hall . She climbed the narrow , carpeted stairs that led to the attic . She opened the door and felt for the light switch ; found it ; flicked it , stooping as she entered . She glanced around . Cartons of clippings and correspondenceon the pinewood flood . Nothing else , except the traps . Six of them . Baited . The room was spotless . Even the air smelled clean and cool . The attic was unheated . No pipes . No radiator . No little holes in the roof . " There is nothing . " Chris jumped from her skin . " Oh , good Jesus ! " she gasped , turning quickly with her hand to a fluttering heart . " Jesus Christ , Karl , do n't do that ! " He was standing on the steps . " Very sorry . But you see ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean . Thanks a lot . " " Maybe cat better . " " What ? " " To catch rats . " Without waiting for an answer , he nodded and left . For a moment , Chris stared at the doorway . Either Karl had n't any sense of humor whatever , or he had one so sly it escaped her detection . She could n't decide which one it was . She considered the rappings again , then glanced at the41angled roof . The street was shaded by various trees , most of them gnarled and intertwined with vines ; and the branches of a mushrooming , massive basswood umbrellaed the entire front third of the house . Was it squirrels after all ? It must be . Or branches . Right . Could be branches . The nights had been windy . " Maybe cat better . " Chris glanced at the doorway again . Pretty smart-ass ? Abruptly she smiled , looking pertly mischievous . She went downstairs to Regan 's bedroom , picked something up , brought it back to the attic , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sleeping . She returned her to her room , tucked her into her bed , then went back to her own bedroom , turned off the television set and went to sleep . ' I'he house was quiet until morning . Eating her breakfast , Chris told Karl in an offhand way that she thought she 'd heard a trap springing shut during the night . " Like to go and take a look ? " Chris suggested , sipping coffeeand pretending to be engrossed in the morning paper . Without any comment , he went up to investigate . Chris passed him in the hall on the second floor as he was returning , staring expressionlessly at the large stuffed mouse he was holding . He 'd found it with its snout clamped tight in a trap . As she walked toward her bedroom , Chris lifted an eyebrow at the mouse . " Someone is funny , " Karl muttered as lie passed her . IIe returned the stuffed animal to Regan 's bedroom . " Sure a lot of things gain ' on , " Chris murmured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She slipped off her robe and prepared to go to work . Yeah , maybe cat better , old buddy . Much better . Vhenever she grinned , her entire face appeared to crinkle . The filming went smoothly that day . Later in the morning , Sharon came by the set and during breaks between scenes , in her portable dressing room , she and Chris handled items of business : a letter to her agent ( she would think about the script ) ; " okay " to the White House ; a wire to Howard remindinghim to telephone on Regan 's birthday ; a call to her business manager asking if she could afford to take off for a year ; plans for a dinner party April twenty-third . Early in the evening , Chris took Regan out to a movie , and the following day they drove around to points of interest in Chris 's Jaguar XKE . The Lincoln Memorial . The Capitol . The cherry blossom lagoon . A bite to eat . Then across the river to Arlington Cemetery and the Tomb of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the grave of John F. Kennedy , seemed to grow distant and a little sad . She stared at the " eternal flame " for a time ; then mutely reached for Chris 's hand . " Mom , why do people have to die ? " The question pierced her mother 's soul . Oh , Rags , you too ? You too ? Oh , no ! And yet what could she tell her ? Lies ? She could n't . She looked at her daughter 's upturned face , eyes misting with tears . Had she sensed her own thoughts ? She had done it so often . . . so often before . " Honey , people get tired , " she answered Regan tenderly . " Why does God let them ? " For a moment , Chris stared . She was puzzled . Disturbed . An atheist , she had never taught Regan religion . She thought it dishonest . " Who 's been telling you about God ? " she asked . " Sharon . " " Oh . " She would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God let us get tired ? " Looking down at those sensitive eyes and that pain , Chris43surrendered ; could n't tell her what she believed . " Well , after a while God gets lonesome for us , Rags . He wants us back . " Regan folded herself into silence . She stayed quiet during the drive home , and her mood persisted all the rest of the day and through Monday . On Tuesday , Regan 's birthday , it seemed to break . Chris took her along to the filming , and when the shooting day was over , the cast and crew sang " Happy Birthday " and brought out a cake . Always a kind and gentle man when sober , Dennings had the lights rewarmed and filmed her as she cut it . he called it a " screen test , " and afterwards promised to make her a star . She seemed quite gay . But after dinner and the opening of presents , the mood seemed to fade . No word from Howard . Chris placed a call to him in Rome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he had n't been there for several days and could n't be reached . He was somewhere on a yacht . Chris made excuses . Regan nodded , subdued , and shook her head to her mother 's suggestion that they go to the Hot Shoppe for a shake . Withouta word , she went downstairs to the basement playroom , where she remained until time for bed . The following morning when Chris opened her eyes , she found Regan in bed with her , half awake . " Well , what in the . . . . What are you doing here ? " Chris chuckled . " My bed was shaking . " " You nut . " Chris kissed her and pulled up her covers . " Go to sleep . It 's still early . " What looked like morning was the beginning of endless night. 44twoHe stood at the edge of the lonely subway platform , listening for the rumble of a train that would still the ache that was always with him . Like his pulse . Heard only in silence . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tunnel . Points of light . They stretched into dark like guides to hopelessness . A cough . He glanced to the left . The gray-stubbled derelict numb on the ground in a pool of his urine was sitting up . With yellowed eyes he stared at the priest with the chipped , sad face . The priest looked away . He would come . He would whine . Couldjya help an old altar boy , Father ? Wouldjya ? The vomit-flaked hand pressing down on the shoulder . The fumblingfor the medal . The reeking of the breath of a thousand confessions with the wine and the garlic and the stale mortal sins belching out all together , and smothering . . . smothering ... 45The priest heard the derelict rising . Do n't come ! Heard a step . Ah , my God , let me be ! " Hi ya , Faddah . " He winced . Sagged . Could n't turn . He could not bear to search for Christ again in stench and hollow eyes ; for the Christ of pus and bleeding excrement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he felt at his sleeve as if for an unseen band of mourning . He dimly remembered another Christ . " I Icy , Faddah ! " The hum of an incoming train . Then sounds of stumbling . IIe looked to the tramp . He was staggering . Fainting . With a blind , sudden rush , the priest was to him ; caught him ; dragged him to the bench against the wall . " I 'm a Cat'lic , " the derelict mumbled . " I 'm Cat'lic . " The priest eased him down ; stretched him out ; saw his train . IIc quickly pulled a dollar from out of his wallet and placed it in the pocket of the derelict 's jacket . Then decided he would lose it . He plucked out the dollar and stuffed it into a urine-damp trouser pocket , then he picked up his bag and boarded the train . IIc sat in a corner and pretended to sleep . At the end of the line he walked to Fordham University . The dollar had been meant for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he signed his name on the register . Damien Karras , he wrote . Then examined it . Something was wrong . Wearily he remembered and added , S.J.IIc took a room in Weigel Ilall and , after an hour , was able to sleep . The following day he attended a meeting of the American Psychiatric Association . As principal speaker , he delivered a paper entitled " Psychological Aspects of Spiritual Develop-46ment . " At the end of the day , he enjoyed a few drinks and a bite to eat with some other psychiatrists . They paid . He left them early . He would have to see his mother . He walked to the crumbling brownstone apartment buildingon Manhattan 's East Twenty-first Street . Pausing by the steps that led up to the door , he eyed the children on the stoop . Unkempt . Ill-clothed . No place to go . He remembered evictions : humiliations : walking home with a seventh-grade sweetheart and encountering his mother as she hopefully rummaged through a garbage can on the corner . He climbed the steps and opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An odor like cooking . Like rotted sweetness . He remembered the visits to Mrs. Choirelli and her tiny apartment with the eighteen cats . He gripped the banister and climbed , overcome by a sudden , draining weariness that he knew was caused by guilt . He should never have left her . Not alone . Her greeting was joyful . A shout . A kiss . She rushed to make coffee . Dark . Stubby , gnarled legs . He sat in the kitchen and listened to her talk , the dingy walls and soiled floor seeping into his bones . The apartment was a hovel . Social Security . Each month , a few dollars from a brother . She sat at the table . Mrs. This . Uncle That . Still in immigrantaccents . He avoided those eyes that were wells of sorrow , eyes that spent days staring out of a window . He should never have left her . He wrote a few letters for her later . She could neither read nor write any English . Then he spent time repairing the tuner on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news . Mayor Lindsay . He went to the bathroom . Yellowing newspaper spread on the tile . Stains of rust in the tub and the sink . On the floor , an old corset . Seeds of vocation . From these he had fled into love . Now the love had grown cold . In the night , he heard it whistling through the chambers of his heart like a lost , crying wind. 47At a quarter to eleven , he kissed her good-bye ; promised to return just as soon as he could . He left with the radio tuned to the news . Once back in his room in Weigel Hall , he gave some thought to writing a letter to the Jesuit head of the Maryland province . He 'd covered the ground with him once before : request for a transfer to the New York province in order to be closer to his mother ; request for a teaching post and relief from his duties . In requesting the latter , he 'd cited as a reason " unfitness " for the work . ' I'hc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course of his annual inspection tour of Georgetown University , a function that closely paralleled that of an army inspector general in the granting of confidential hearings to those who had grievances or complaints . On the point of Damien Karras ' niotlicr , the Provincial had nodded and expressed his syinpatliv ; but the question of the priest 's " unfitness " he thought contradictory on its face . But Karras had pursued it : " Well , it 's more than psychiatry , Toni . You know that . Sonic of their problems conic down to vocation , to the meaning of their lives . Hell , it is n't always sex that 's involved , it 's their faith , and I just ca n't cut it , Torn , it 's too munch . I need out . I 'm having problems of my own . I Meal ) , doubts . " " What thinking man does n't , Damien ? " A harried man with many appointments , the Provincial had not pressed him for the reasons for his doubt . For which Karras was grateful . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The need to rend food with the teeth and then defecate . My mother 's nine First Fridays . Stinking socks . Thalidomide babies . An item in the paper about a young altar boy waiting at a bus stop ; set on by strangers ; sprayed with kerosene ; ignited . No . Too emotional . Vague . Existential . More rooted in logic was the silence of God . In the world48there was evil . And much of the evil resulted from doubt ; from an honest confusion among men of good will . Would a reasonable God refuse to end it ? Not reveal Himself ? Not speak ? " Lord , give us a sign .... " The raising of Lazarus was dim in the distant past . No one now living had heard his laughter . Why not a sign ? At various times the priest would long to have lived with Christ : to have seen ; to have touched ; to have probed His eyes . Ah , my God , let me see You ! Let me know ! Come in dreams ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now with pen above paper . Perhaps it was n't time that had silenced the Provincial . Perhaps he understood that faith was finally a natter of love . The Provincial had promised to consider the requests , but thus far nothing had been done . Karras wrote the letter and went to bed . He sluggishly awakened at 5 A.M. and went to the chapel in Weigel Hall , secured a Host , then returned to his room and said Mass . " Et clamor meus ad to veniat , ' " he prayed with murmured anguish . " Let my cry cone unto Thee .... ' He lifted the Host in consecration with an aching remembrance of the joy it once gave him ; felt once again , as he did each morning , the pang of an unexpected glimpse from afar and unnoticed of a long-lost love . He broke the Host above the chalice . " Peace I leave you . My peace I give you .... ' He tucked the Host inside his mouth and swallowed the papery taste of despair . When the Mass was over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bag . He rushed for the seven-ten train back to Washington , carrying pain in a black valise. 49threeEarly on the morning of April 11 , Chris made a telephone call to her doctor in Los Angeles and asked him for a referral to a local psychiatrist for Regan . " Oh ? What 's wrong ? " Chris explained . Beginning on the day after Regan 's birthday  --  andfollowing Howard 's failure to call  --  shc had noticed a sudden and dramatic change in her daughter 's behavior and disposition . Insomnia . Quarrelsome . Fits of temper . Kicked things . Threw things . Screamed . Would n't cat . In addition , her energy seemed abnormal . Shc was constantly moving , touching , turning ; tapping ; running and jumping about . Doing poorly with schoolwork . Fantasy playmate . Eccentric attention-gettingtactics . " Such as what ? " the physician inquired . She started with the rappings . Since the night she 'd investigatedthe attic , she 'd heard them again on two occasions. 50In both of these instances , she 'd noticed , Regan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cease at the moment Chris entered . Secondly , she told him , Regan would " lose " things in the room : a dress ; her toothbrush ; books ; her shoes . She complained about " somebody moving " her furniture . Finally , on the morning following the dinner at the White House , Chris saw Karl in Regan 's bedroom pulling a bureau back into place from a spot that was halfway across the room . When Chris had inquired what he was doing , he repeated his former " Someone is funny , " and refused to elaborate any further , but shortly thereafter Chris had found Regan in the kitchen complaining that someone had moved all her furnitureduring the night when she was sleeping . This was the incident , Chris explained , that had finally crystallized her suspicions . It was clearly her daughter who was doing it all . " You mean somnambulism ? She 's doing it in her sleep ? " " No , Marc , she 's doing it when she 's awake . To get atten-tion . " Chris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened twice more and , was always followed by Regan 's insistencethat she sleep with her mother . " Well , that could be physical , " the internist ventured . " No , Marc , I did n't say the bed is shaking . I said that she says that it 's shaking . " " Do you know that it is n't shaking ? " " No . " " Well , it might be clonic spasms , " he murmured . " Who ? " " Any temperature ? " " No . Listen , what do you think ? " she asked . " Should I take her to a shrink or what ? " " Chris , you mentioned her schoolwork . How is she doing with her math ? " " Why 'd you ask ? " 51 " How 's she doing ? " he persisted . " Just rotten . I mean , suddenly rotten . " He grunted . " Why 'd you ask ? " she repeated . " Well , it 's part of the syndrome . " " Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not guess about it over the phone . Got a pencil ? " He wanted to give her the name of a Washington internist . " Marc , ca n't you come out here and check her yourself ? " Jamie . A lingering infection . Chris 's doctor at that time had prescribed a new , broad-spectrum antibiotic . Refilling a prescription at a local drugstore , the pharmacist was wary . " I do n't want to alarm you , ma'am , but this . . . Well , it 's quite new on the market , and they 've found that in Georgia it 's been causing aplastic anemia in . . . " Jamie . Jamie . Dead . And ever since , Chris had never trusted doctors . Only Marc . And that had taken years . " Marc , ca n't you ? " Chris pleaded . " No , I ca n't , but do n't worry . This man is brilliant . The best . Now get a pencil . " Hesitation . Then , " Okay . " She wrote down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell hint to call me , " the internist advised . " And forget the psychiatrist for now . " " Are you sure ? " he delivered a blistering statement regarding the readiness of the general public to recognize psychosomatic illness , while failing to recognize the reverse : that illness of the body was often the cause of seeming illness of the mind . " Now what would you say , " he proposed as an instance , " if you were my internist , God forbid , and I told you I had headaches , recurring nightmares , nausea , insomnia and blurring of the vision ; and also that I generally felt unglued and was worried to death about my job ? Would you say I was neurotic ? " 52 " I 'm a bad one to ask , Marc ; I know that you 're crazy . " " Those symptoms I gave you are the same as for brain tumor , Chris . Check the body . That 's first . Then we 'll see . " Chris telephoned the internist and made an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . The filming was over , at least for her . Burke Dennings continued , loosely supervising the work of the " second unit , " a generally less expensive crew that was filming scenes of lesser importance , mostly helicopter shots of various exteriors around the city ; also stunt work ; scenes without any of the principal actors . But he wanted each foot of film to be perfect . The doctor was in Arlington . Samuel Klein . While Regan sat crossly in an examining room , Klein seated her mother in his office and took a brief case history . She told him the trouble . He listened ; nodded ; made copious notes. , When she mentioned the shaking of the bed , he appeared to frown . But Chris continued : " Marc seemed to think it was kind of significant that Regan 's doing poorly with her math . Now why was that ? " " You mean schoolwork ? " " Yes , schoolwork , but math in particular , though . What 's it mean ? " " Well , let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He then excused himself and gave Regan a complete examinationthat included taking samples of her urine and her blood . The urine was for testing of her liver and kidney functions ; the blood for a number of checks : diabetes ; thyroid function ; red-cell blood count looking for possible anemia , white-cell blood count looking for exotic diseases of the blood . After he finished , he sat for a while and talked to Regan , observing her demeanor , and then returned to Chris and started writing a prescription . " She appears to have a hyperkinetic behavior disorder . " " A what ? " 53 " A disorder of the nerves . At least we think it is . We do n't know yet exactly how it works , but it 's often seen in early adolescence . She shows all the symptoms : the hyperactivity ; the temper ; her performance in math . " " Yeah , the math . Why the math ? " " It affects concentration . " He ripped the prescription from the small blue pad and handed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " What ? " " Methylphenidate . " " Oh . " " Ten milligrams , twice a day . I 'd recommend one at eight A.M. , and the other at two in the afternoon . " She was eyeing the prescription . " What is it ? A tranquilizer ? " " A stimulant . " " Stimulant ? She 's higher'n a kite right now . " " Iler condition is n't quite what it seems , " explained Klein . " It 's a form of overcompensation . An overreaction to de-pression . " " Depression ? " Klein nodded . " Depression . . . " Chris murmured . She was thoughtful . " Well , you mentioned her father , " said Klein . Chris looked up . " Do you think I should take her to see a psychiatrist ? " " Oh , no . I 'd wait and see what happens with the Ritalin . I think that 's the answer . Wait two or three weeks . " " So you think it 's all nerves . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been telling ? This 'll stop it ? " His answer puzzled her . Ile asked her if she 'd ever known Regan to swear or use obscenities . " Never , " Chris answered. 54 " Well , you see , that 's quite similar to things like her lying  --  uncharacteristic , from what you tell me , but in certain disorders of the nerves it can  --  " " Wait a minute , " Chris interrupted , perplexed . " Where 'd you ever get the notion she uses obscenities ? I mean , is that what you were saying or did I misunderstand ? " For a moment , he eyed her rather curiously ; considered ; then cautiously ventured , " Yes , I 'd say that she uses obscen- ities . Were n't you aware of it ? " " I 'm still not aware of it ! What are you talking ' about ? " " Well , she let loose quite a string while I was examining her , Mrs. MacNeil . " " You 're kidding ! Like what ? " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vocabulary 's rather extensive . " " Well , what , for instance ? I mean , give me an example ! " He shrugged . " You mean shit ' ? Or fuck ' ? " He relaxed . " Yes , she used those words , " he said . " And what else did she say ? Specifically . " " Well , specifically , Mrs. MacNeil , she advised me to keep my goddam fingers away from her cunt . " Chris gasped with shock . " She used those words ? " " Well , it is n't unusual , Mrs. MacNeil , and I really would n't worry about it at all . It 's a part of the syndrome . " She was shaking her head , looking down at her shoes . " It 's just hard to believe . " " Look , I doubt that she even understood what she was saying , " he soothed . " Yeah , I guess , " murmured Chris . " Maybe not . " " Try the Ritalin , " he advised her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd like to take a look at her again in two weeks . " He consulted a calendar pad on his desk . " Let 's see ; let's55make it Wednesday the twenty-seventh . Would that be convenient ? " he asked , glancing up . " Yeah , sure , " she murmured , getting up from the chair . She crumpled the prescription in a pocket of her coat . " The twenty-seventh would be fine . " " I 'm quite a big fan of yours , " Klein said , smiling , as he opened the door leading into the hall . She paused in the doorway , preoccupied , a fingertip pressed to her lip . She glanced to the doctor . " You do n't think a psychiatrist , huh ? " " I do n't know . But the best explanation is always the simplest one . Let 's wait . Let 's wait and see . " He smiled encouragingly . " In the meantime , try not to worry . " " How ? " She left him . As they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had said . " That you 're nervous . " Chris had decided not to talk about her language . Burke . She picked it up from Burke . But she did speak to Sharon about it later , asking if she 'd ever heard Regan use that kind of obscenity . " Why , no , " replied Sharon . " I mean , not even lately . But you know , I think her art teacher made a remark . " A special tutor who came to the house . " You mean recently ? " Chris asked . " Yes , it was just last week . But you know her . I just figured maybe Regan said damn ' or crap . ' You know , something like that . " " By the way , have you been talking to her much about religion , Shar ? " Sharon flushed . " Well , a little ; that 's all . I mean , it 's hard to avoid . You see , she asks so many questions , and  --  well . . . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard . I mean , how do I answer without telling what I think is a great big lie ? " " Give her multiple choice . " In the days that preceded her scheduled dinner party , Chris was extremely diligent in seeing that Regan took her dosage of Ritalin . By the night of the party , however , she had failed to observe any noticeable improvement . There were subtle signs , in fact , of a gradual deterioration : increasedforgetfulness ; untidiness ; and one complaint of nausea . As for attention-getting tactics , although the familiar ones failed to recur , there appeared to be a new one : reports of a foul , unpleasant " smell " in Regan 's bedroom . At Regan 's insistence , Chris took a whiff one day and smelled nothing . " You do n't ? " " You mean , you smell it right now ? " Chris had asked her . " Well , sure ! " " What 's it smell like ? " She 'd wrinkled her nose . " Well , like something burny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do n't you smell it ? " " Well , yes , bon , " she 'd lied . " Just a little . Let 's open up the window for a while , get some air in . " In fact , she 'd smelled nothing , but had made up her mind that she would temporize , at least until the appointment with the doctor . She was also preoccupied with a number of other concerns . One was arrangements for the dinner party . Another had to do with the script . Although she was very enthusiastic about the prospect of directing , a natural caution had prevented her from making a prompt decision . In the meantime , her agent was calling her daily . She told him she 'd given the script to Dennings for an opinion , and hoped he was reading and not consuming it . The third , and the most important , of Chris 's concerns57was the failure of two financial ventures : a purchase of convertibledebentures through the use of prepaid interest ; and an investment in an oil-drilling project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sheltering of income that would have been subject to enormous taxation . But something even worse had developed : the wells had come up dry and rocketing interest rates had prompted a sell-off in bonds . These were the problems that her gloomy business manager flew into town to discuss . He arrived on Thursday . Chris had him charting and explaining through Friday . At last , she decided on a course of action that the manager thought wise . IIc nodded approval . But he frowned when she brought up the subject of buying a Ferrari . " You mean , a new one ? " " Why not ? You know , I drove one in a picture once . If we write to the factory , maybe , and remind than , it could be they 'd give us a deal . Do n't you think ? " Ile did n't . And cautioned that he thought a new car was improvident . " Ben , I made eight hundred thou last year and you 're saying I ca n't get a freaking car ! Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go ? " He reminded her that most of her money was in shelters . Then he listed the various drains on her gross : federal income tax ; projected federal income tax ; her state tax ; tax on her real estate holdings ; ten percent commission to her agent ; five to him ; five to her publicist ; one and a quarter taken out as donation to the Motion Picture Welfare Fund ; an outlay for wardrobe in tune with the fashion ; salaries to Willie and Karl and Sharon and the caretaker of the Los Angeles home ; various travel costs ; and , finally , her monthly expenses . " Will you do another picture this year ? " he asked her . She shrugged . " I do n't know . Do I have to ? " " Yes ; I think you 'd better . " 58She cupped her face in both her hands and eyed him moodily . " What about a Honda ? " He made no reply . Later that evening , Chris tried to put all of her worries aside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next night 's party . " Let 's serve the curry buffet instead of sit-down , " she told Willie and Karl . " We can set up a table at the end of the living room . Right ? " " Very good , madam , " Karl answered quickly . " So what do you think , Willie ? A fresh fruit salad for dessert ? " " Yes , excellent ! " said Karl . " Thanks , Willie . " She 'd invited an interesting mixture . In addition to Burke ( " Show up sober , dammit ! " ) and the youngish director of the second unit , she expected a senator ( and wife ) ; an Apollo astronaut ( and wife ) ; two Jesuits from Georgetown ; her next-door neighbors ; and Mary Jo Perrin and Ellen Cleary . Mary Jo Perrin was a plump and gray-headed Washington seeress whom Chris had met at the White House dinner and liked immensely . She 'd expected to find her austere and forbidding , but " You 're not like that at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bubbly-warm and unpretentious . Ellen Cleary was a middle-aged State Department secretary who 'd worked in the U.S. Embassy in Moscow when Chris toured Russia . She had gone to considerable effort and trouble to rescue Chris from a number of difficulties and encumbrances encountered in the course of her travels , not the least of which had been caused by the redheaded actress ' outspokenness . Chris had remembered her with affection over the years , and had looked her up on coming to Washing- ton . " Hey , Shar , " she asked , " which priests are coming ? " 59 " I 'm not sure yet . I invited the president and the dean of the college , but I think that the president 's sending an alternate . His secretary called me late this morning and said that he might have to go out of town . " " Who 's he sending ? " Chris asked with guarded interest . " Let me sec . " Sharon nun nagcd through scraps of notes . " Yes , here it is , Chris . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the campus ? " " Well , 1 ' 11i not sire . " " Oh , okay . " She seemed disappointed . " Keep an eye on Burke tomorrow night , " she instructed . " I will . " " Where 's Rags ? " " Downstairs . "  --  You know , maybe you should start to keep your typewriterthere ; do n't you think ? I mean , that way you can watch her when you 're typing . Okay ? I do n't like her being alone so much .  --  " Good idea . " " Okay , later . Go home . Meditate . Play with horses . " The planning and preparations at an end , Chris again found herself turning worried thoughts toward Regan . She tried to watch television . Could not concentrate . Felt uneasy . There was a strangeness in the house . Like settling stillness . Weighted dust . By midnight , all in the house were asleep . There were no disturbances . That night. 6ofourShe greeted her guests in a lime-green hostess costume with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfortable . They reflected her hope for the evening . The first to arrive was Mary Jo Perrin , who came with Robert , her teen-age son . The last was pink-faced Father Dyer . He was young and diminutive , with fey eyes behind steel-rimmed spectacles . At the door , he apologized for his lateness . " Could n't find the right necktie , " he told Chris expressionlessly . For a moment , she stared at him blankly , then burst into laughter . Her day-long depression began to lift . The drinks did their work . By a quarter to ten , they were scattered about the living room eating their dinners in vibrant knots of conversation . Chris filled her plate from the steaming buffet and scanned the room for Mary Jo Perrin . There . On a sofa with Father6rWagner , the Jesuit dean . Chris had spoken to him briefly . He had a bald , freckled scalp and a dry , soft manner . Chris drifted to the sofa and folded to the floor in front of the coffee table as the seeress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary Jo ! " the dean said , smiling as he lifted a forkful of curry to his mouth . " Yeah , come on , Mary Jo , " echoed Chris . " Oh , hi ! Great curry ! " said the dean . " Not too hot ? " " Not at all ; it 's just right . Mary Jo has been telling methere used to be a Jesuit who was also a medium . " " And he does n't believe me ! " chuckled the seeress . " Ali , distinguo , " corrected the dean . " I just said it washard to believe . " " You mean medium medium ? " asked Chris . " Why , of course , " said Mary Jo . " Why , he even used to lev-itate ! " " Oh , I do it every morning , " said the Jesuit quietly . " You mean he held seances ? " Chris asked Mrs. Perrin . " Well , yes , " she answered . " He was very , very famous in the nineteenth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spiritualist of his time who was n't ever clearly convicted of fraud . " " As I said , he was n't a Jesuit , " commented the clean . " Oh , my , but was he ! " She laughed . " When he turned twenty-two , he joined the Jesuits and promised not to work anymore as a medium , but they threw him out of France "  --  she laughed even harder  --  " right after a seance that he held at the Tuileries . Do you know what lie did ? In the middle of the seance he told the empress she was about to be touched by the hands of a spirit child who was about to fully materialize , and when they suddenly turned all of the lights on "  --  she guffawed  --  " they caught him sitting with his naked foot on the empress ' arm ! Now , can you imagine ? " The Jesuit was smiling as he set clown his plate . " Don't62come looking for discounts any more on indulgences , Mary Jo . " " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " We were pushing our quota with the Medici popes . " " Y'know , I had an experience once , " began Chris . But the dean interrupted . " Are you making this a matter of confession ? " Chris smiled and said , " No , I 'm not a Catholic . " " Oh , well , neither are the Jesuits . " Mrs. Perrin chuckled . " Dominican slander , " retorted the dean . Then to Chris he said , " I 'm sorry , my dear . You were saying ? " " Well , just that I thought I saw somebody levitate once . In Bhutan . " She recounted the story . " Do you think that 's possible ? " she ended . " I mean , really , seriously . " " Who knows ? " He shrugged . " Who knows what gravity is . Or matter , when it comes to that . " " Would you like my opinion ? " interjected Mrs. Perrin . The dean said , " No , Mary Jo ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have I , " Chris muttered . " What was that ? " asked the dean , leaning forward . " Oh , nothing . Say , there 's something I 've been meaning toask you . Do you know that little cottage that 's back of thechurch over there ? " She pointed in the general direction . " Holy Trinity ? " he asked . " Yes , right . Veil , what goes on in there ? " " Oh , well , that 's where they say Black Mass , " said Mrs. Perrin . " Black who ? " " Black Mass . " " What 's that ? " " She 's kidding , " said the dean . " Yes , I know , " said Chris , " but I 'm dumb . I mean , what 's a Black Mass ? " " Oh , basically , it 's a travesty on the Catholic Mass , " ex-63plained the dean . " It 's connected to witchcraft . Devil wor-ship . " " Really ? You mean , there really is such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Although I heard a statistic once about something like possibly fifty thousand Black Masses being said every year in the city of Paris . " " You mean now ? " marveled Chris . " It 's just something I heard . " " Yes , of course , from the Jesuit secret service , " twitted Mrs. Perrin . " Not at all . I hear voices , " responded the dean . " You know , back in L.A. , " mentioned Chris , " you hear an awful lot of stories about witch cults being around . I 've often wondered if it 's true . " " Well , as I said , I would n't know , " said the dean . " But I 'll tell you who might  --  Joe Dyer . Where 's Joe ? " The dean looked around . " Oh , over there , " he said , nodding toward the other priest , who was standing at the buffet with his back to them . He was heaping a second helping onto his plate . " Ilcy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impassive . " You called , great dean ? " The other Jesuit beckoned with his fingers . " All right , just a second , " answered Dyer , and resumed his attack on the curry and salad . " That 's the only leprechaun in the priesthood , " said the dean with an edge of fondness . IIc sipped at his wine . " They had a couple of cases of desecration in 1 loly Trinity last week , and Joe said something about one of them reminding him of some things they used to do at Black Mass , so I expect he knows something about the subject . " " What happened at the church ? " asked Mary Jo Perrin . " Oh , it 's really too disgusting , " said the clean . " Come on , we 're all through with our dinners . " " No , please . It 's too much , " he demurred. 64 " Oh , cone on ! " " You mean you ca n't read my mind , Mary Jo ? " he asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responded , " but I really do n't think that I 'm worthy to enter that Holy of Holies ! " She chuckled . " Well , it really is sick , " began the dean . He described the desecrations . In the first of the incidents , the elderly sacristan of the church had discovered a mound of human excrement on the altar cloth directly before the tabernacle . " Oh , that really is sick . " Mrs. Perrin grimaced . " Well , the other 's even worse , " remarked the dean ; then employed indirection and one or two euphemisms to explain how a massive phallus sculpted in clay had been found glued firmly to a statue of Christ on the left side altar . " Sick enough ? " he concluded . Chris noticed that Mary Jo seemed genuinely disturbed as she said , " Oh , that 's enough , now . I 'm sorry that I asked . Let 's change the subject , please . " " No , I 'm fascinated , " said Chris . " Yes , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Father Dyer . He was hovering over her with his plate . " Listen , give me just a minute , and then I 'll be back . I think I 've got something going over there with the astro-naut . " " Like what ? " asked the dean . Father Dyer raised his eyebrows in deadpan surmise . " Would you believe , " he asked , " first missionary on the moon ? " They burst into laughter . " You 're just the right size , " said Mrs. Perrin . " They could stow you in the nose conc . " " No , not me , " he corrected her solemnly , and then turned to the dean to explain : " I 've been trying to fix it up for Emory. " 65 " That 's our disciplinarian on campus , " Dyer explained in an aside to the women . " Nobody 's up there and that 's what he likes , you see ; he sort of likes things quiet . " " And so who would he convert ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Dyer frowned at her earnestly . " He'dconvert the astronauts . That 's it . I mean , that 's what he likes : You know , one or two people . No groups . Just a couple . " With deadpan gaze , Dyer glanced toward the astronaut . " Excuse me , " he said and walked away . " I like him , " said Mrs. Perrin . " Me too , " Chris agreed . Then she turned to the dean . " You have n't told me what goes on in that cottage , " she reminded him . " Big secret ? Who 's that priest I keep seeing there ? You know , sort of dark ? Do you know the one I mean ? " " Father Karras , " said the dean in a lowered tone ; with a trace of regret . " What 's he do ? " " IIe 's a counselor . " He put down his wineglass and turned it by the stem . " Had a pretty rough knock last night , poor guy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sudden concern . " Well , his mother passed away . " Chris felt a melting sensation of grief that she could n't explain . " Oh , I 'm sorry , " she said . " he seems to be taking it pretty hard , " resumed the Jesuit . " She was living by herself , and I guess she was dead for a couple of days before they found her . " " Oh , how awful , " Mrs. Perrin murmured . " Who found her ? " Chris asked solemnly . " The superintendent of her apartment building . I guess they would n't have found her even now except . . . Well , the nextdoorneighbors complained about her radio going all the time . " " That 's sad , " Chris murmured . " Excuse me , please , madam . " 66She looked up at Karl . He held a tray filled with glasses and liqueurs . " Sure , set it down here , Karl ; that 'll be fine . " Chris liked to serve the liqueurs to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that might otherwise be lacking . " Well , let 's see now , I 'll start with you , " she told the dean and Mrs. Perrin ; and served them . Then she moved about the room , taking orders and fetching for each of her guests , and by the time she had made the rounds , the various clusters had shifted to new combinations , except for Dyer and the astronaut , who seemed to be getting thicker . " No , I 'm really not a priest , " Chris heard Dyer say solemnly , his arm on the astronaut 's chuckle-heaved shoulder . " I 'm actually a terribly avant-garde rabbi . " And not long after , she overheard Dyer inquiring of the astronaut : " What is space ? " and when the astronaut shrugged and said he really did n't know , Father Dyer had fixed him with an earnest frown and said , " You should . " Chris was standing with Ellen Cleary afterward , reminiscing about Moscow , when she heard a familiar , strident voice ringing angrily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! He was shrieking obscenities at someone . Chris excused herself and went quickly to the kitchen , where Dennings was railing viciously at Karl while Sharon made futile attempts to hush hint " Burke ! " exclaimed Chris . " Knock it off ! " The director ignored her , continued to rage , the corners of his mouth flecked foamy with saliva , while Karl leaned mutely against the sink with folded arms and stolid expression , his eyes fixed unwaveringly on Dennings . " Karl ! " Chris snapped . " Will you get out of here ? Get out ! ' Ca n't you see how he is ? " But the Swiss would not budge until Chris began actually to shove him toward the door. 67 " Naa-zi pig ! " Dennings screamed at his back . And then he turned genially to Chris and rubbed his hands together . " What 's dessert ? " he asked mildly . " Dessert ! " Chris thumped at her brow with the heel of her hand . " Well , I 'm hungry , " he whined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've got to get Regan up to bed . And , Burke , for chrissakes , " she asked the director , " will you behave yourself ! There are priests out there ! " She pointed . He creased his brow as his eyes grew intense with a sudden and apparently genuine interest . " Oh , you noticed that too ? " he asked without guile . Chris left the kitchen and went down to check Regan in the basement playroom , where her daughter had spent the entire day . She found her playing with the Ouija board . She seemed sullen ; abstracted ; remote . Well , at least she is n't feisty , Chris reflected , and hopeful of diverting her , she brought her to the living room and began to introduce her to her guests . " Oh , is n't she darling ! " said the wife of the senator . Regan was strangely well behaved , except for a moment with Mrs. Perrin when she would neither speak nor accept her hand . But the seeress made a joke of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She winked at Chris . But then , with a curious air of scrutiny , she reached forward and gripped Regan 's hand with a gentle pressure , as if checking her pulse . Regan quickly shook her off and glared malevolently . " Oh , dear , dear , dear , she must be tired , " Mrs. Perrin said casually ; yet she continued to watch Regan with a probing fixity , an anxiety unexplained . " She 's been feeling kind of sick , " Chris murmured in apology . She looked down at Regan . " Have n't you , honey ? " Regan did not answer . She kept her eyes on the floor . There was no one left for Regan to meet except the senator68and Robert , Mrs. Perrin 's son , and Chris thought it best to pass them up . She took Regan up to bed and tucked her in . " Do you think you can sleep ? " Chris asked . " I do n't know , " she answered dreamily . She 'd turned on her side and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Would you like me to read to you for a while ? " A shake of the head . " Okay , then . Try to sleep . " She leaned over and kissed her , and then walked to the door and flicked the light switch . " Night , my baby . " Chris was almost out the door when Regan called out to her very softly : " Mother , what 's wrong with me ? " So haunted . The tone so despairing . So disproportionate to her condition . For a moment the mother felt shaken and confused . But quickly she righted herself . " Well , it 's just like I said , hon ; it 's nerves . All you need is those pills for a couple of weeks and I know you 'll be feeling just fine . Now then , try to go to sleep , hon , okay ? " No response . Chris waited . " Okay ? " she repeated . " Okay , " whispered Regan . Chris abruptly noticed goose pimples rising on her forearm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this room . Where 's the draft coming in from ? She moved to the window and checked along the edges . Found nothing . Turned to Regan . " You warm enough , baby ? " No answer . Chris moved to the bedside . " Regan ? You asleep ? " she whispered . Eyes closed . Deep breathing . Chris tiptoed from the room . From the hall she heard singing , and as she walked down the stairs , she saw with pleasure that the young Father69Dyer was playing the piano near the living-room picture window and was leading a group that had gathered around him in cheerful song . As she entered the living room , they had just finished " Till We Meet Again . " Chris started forward to join the group , but was quickly intercepted by the senator and his wife , who had their coats across their arms . They seemed edgy . " Are you leaving so soon ? " Chris asked . " Oh , I 'm really so sorry , and my dear , we 've had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Martha 's got a headache . " " Oh , I am so sorry , but I do feel terrible , " moaned the senator'swife . " Will you excuse us , Chris ? It 's been such a lovely party . " " I 'm really sorry you have to go , " said Chris . She accompanied them to the door and she could hear Father Dyer in the background asking , " Does anyone else know the words to I 'll Bet You 're Sorry Now , Tokyo Rose ' ? " She bade them good night . On her way back to the living room , Sharon stepped quietly out from the study . " Where 's Burke ? " Chris asked her . " In there , " Sharon answered with a nod toward the study . " He 's sleeping it off . Say , what did the senator say to you ? Anything ? " " What do you mean ? " asked Chris . " They just left . " " Well , I guess it 's as well . " " Sharon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burke , " sighed Sharon . In a guarded tone , she describedan encounter between the senator and the director . Dennings had remarked to him , in passing , said Sharon , that there appeared to be " an alien pubic hair floating round in my gin . " Then he 'd turned to the senator and added in a tone that was vaguely accusatory , " Never seen it before in my life ! Have you ? " 70Chris giggled as Sharon went on to describe how the senator'sembarrassed reaction had triggered one of Dennings ' quixotic rages , in which he 'd expressed his " boundless gratitude " for the existence of politicians , since without them " one could n't distinguish who the statesmen were , you see . " When the senator had moved away in a huff , the director turned to Sharon and said proudly , " There , you see ? I did n't curse . Now then , do n't you think I handled that rather de-murely ? " Chris could n't help laughing . " Oh , well , let him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case he wakes up . Would you mind ? " " Not at all . " Sharon entered the study . In the living room , Mary Jo Perrin sat alone and thoughtful in a corner chair . She looked edgy ; disturbed . Chris started to join her , but changed her mind when one of the neighbors drifted over to the corner . Chris headed for the piano instead . Dyer broke off his playingof chords and looked up to greet her . " Yes , young lady , and what can we do for you today ? We 're running a special on novenas . " Chris chuckled with the others . " I thought I 'd get the scoop on what goes on at Black Mass , " she said . " Father Wagner said you were the expert . " The group at the piano fell silent with interest . " No , not really , " said Dyer , lightly touching some chords . " Why 'd you mention Black Mass ? " he asked her soberly . " Oh , well , some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those things that they found at Holy Trinity , and  --  " " Oh , you mean the desecrations ? " Dyer interrupted . " Hey , somebody give us a clue what 's going on , " demanded the astronaut . " Me too , " said Ellen Cleary . " I 'm lost . " " Well , they found some desecrations at the church down the street , " explained Dyer. ? 1 " Well , like what ? " asked the astronaut . " Forget it , " Father Dyer advised him . " Let 's just say obscenities , okay ? " " Father ' Wagner says you told him it was like at Black Mass , " prompted Chris , " and I wondered what went on at those things ? " " Oh , I really do n't know all that much , " he protested . " In fact , most of what I know is what I 've heard from another Jeb . " " What 's a Jeb ? " Chris asked . " Short for Jesuit . Father Karras is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly alert . " Oh , the dark priest at Holy Trinity ? " " You know him ? " asked Dyer . " No , I just heard him mentioned , that 's all . " " Well , I think he did a paper on it once . You know , just from the psychiatric side . " " Whaddya mean ? " asked Chris . " Whaddya mean , whaddya mean ? " " Are you telling me he 's a psychiatrist ? " " Oh , well , sure . Gee , I 'm sorry . I just assumed that you knew . " " Listen , somebody tell me something ! " the astronaut demandedimpatiently . " What does go on at Black Mass ? " " Let 's just say perversions . " Dyer shrugged . " Obscenities . Blasphemies . It 's an evil parody of the Mass , where instead of God they worshiped Satan and sometimes offered human sacrifice . " Ellen Cleary shook her head and walked away . " This is getting too creepy for me . " She smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joined the group unobtrusively . " But how can you know that ? " she asked the young Jesuit . " Even if there was such a thing as Black Mass , who 's to say what went on there ? " 72 73 " Well , I guess they got most of it , " answered Dyer , " from the people who were caught and then confessed . " " Oh , come on , " said the dean . " Those confessions were worthless , Joe . They were tortured . " " No , only the snotty ones , " Dyer said blandly . There was a ripple of vaguely nervous laughter . The dean eyed his watch . " Well , I really should be going , " he said to Chris . " I 've got the six-o'clock Mass in Dahlgren Chapel . " " I 've got the banjo Mass . " Dyer beamed . Then his eyes shifted to a point in the room behind Chris , and he sobered abruptly . " Well , now , I think we have a visitor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head . Chris turned . And gasped on seeing Regan in her nightgown , urinating gushingly onto the rug . Staring fixedly at the astronaut , she intoned in a lifeless voice , " You 're going to die up there . " " Oh , my God ! " cried Chris in pain , rushing to her daughter . " Oh , God , oh , my baby , oh , come on , come with me ! " She took Regan by the arms and led her quickly away with a tremulous apology over her shoulder to the ashen astronaut : " Oh , I 'm so sorry ! She 's been sick , she must be walking in her sleep ! She did n't know what she was saying ! " " Gee , maybe we should go , " she heard Dyer say to someone . " No , no , stay , " Chris protested , turning around for a moment . " Please , stay ! It 's okay ! I 'll be back in just a minute ! " Chris paused by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stain became indelible , and then she walked Regan upstairs to her bathroom , bathed her and changed her nightgown . " Honey , why did you say that ? " Chris asked her repeatedly , but Regan appeared not to understand and mumblednon sequiturs . Her eyes were vacant and clouded . Chris tucked her into bed , and almost immediately Regan appeared to fall asleep . For a time Chris waited , listening to her breathing . Then left the room . At the bottom of the stairs , she encountered Sharon and the young director of the second unit assisting Dennings out of the study . They had called a cab and were going to shepherd him back to his suite at the Sheraton-Park . " Take it easy , " Chris advised as they left the house with Dennings between them . Barely conscious , the director said , " Fuck it , " and slipped into fog and the waiting cab . Chris returned to the living room , where the guests who still remained expressed their sympathy as she gave them a brief account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the other " attention-getting " phenomena , Mrs. Perrin stared at her intently . Once Chris looked at her , expecting her to comment , but she said nothing and Chris continued . " Does she walk in her sleep quite a bit ? " asked Dyer . " No , tonight 's the first time . Or at least , the first time I know of , so I guess it 's this hyperactivity thing . Do n't you think ? " " Oh , I really would n't know , " said the priest . " I 've heard sleepwalking 's common at puberty , except that  --  " Here he shrugged and broke off . " I do n't know . Guess you 'd better ask your doctor . " Throughout the remainder of the discussion , Mrs. Perrin sat quietly , watching the dance of flames in the living-room fireplace . Almost as subdued , Chris noticed , was the astronaut , who was scheduled for a flight to the moon within the year . He stared at his drink with a now-and-then grunt meant to signify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one made reference to what Regan had said to him . " Well , I do have that Mass , " said the dean at last , rising to leave . It triggered a general departure . They all stood up and expressedtheir thanks for dinner and the evening . At the door , Father Dyer took Chris 's hand and probed hereyes earnestly . " Do you think there 's a part in one of your movies for a very short priest who can play the piano ? " he asked . " Well , if there is n't "  --  Chris laughed  --  " then I 'll have one written in for you , Father . " " I was thinking of my brother , " he told her solemnly . " Oh , you ! " she laughed again , and bade him a fond and warm good night . The last to leave were Mary Jo Perrin and her son . Chris held them at the door with idle chatter . She had the feeling that Mary Jo had something on her mind , but was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked her opinion on Regan 's continued use of the Ouija board and her Captain Howdy fixation . " Do you think there 's any harm in it ? " she asked . Expecting an airily perfunctory dismissal , Chris was surprised when Mrs. Perrin frowned and looked down at the doorstep . She seemed to be thinking , and still in this posture , she stepped outside and joined her son , who was waiting on the stoop . When at last she lifted her head , her eyes were in shadow . " I would take it away from her , " she said quietly . She handed ignition keys to her son . " Bobby , start up themotor , " she instructed . " It 's cold . " He took the keys , told Chris that he 'd loved her in all her films , and then walked shyly away toward an old , battered Mustangparked down the street . Mrs. Perrin 's eyes were still in shadow . " I do n't know what you think of me , " she said , speaking slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's wrong . Yes , I think I have a gift , " she continued quietly . " But it is n't occult . In fact , to me it seems natural ; perfectly natural . Being a Catholic , I believe that we all have a foot in two worlds . The one that we 're conscious of is time . But now and then a freak like me gets a flash from the other foot ; 7574and that one , I think . . . is in eternity . Well , eternity has no time . There the future is present . So now and again when I feel that other foot , I believe that I get to see the future . Who knows ? Maybe not . Maybe all of it 's coincidence . " She shrugged . " But I think I do . And if that 's so , why , I still say it 's natural , you see . But now the occult . . . " She paused , picking words . " The occult is something different . I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be dangerous . And that includes fooling around with a Ouija board . " Until now , Chris had thought her a woman of eminent sense . And yet something in her manner now was deeply disturbing . She felt a creeping foreboding that she tried to dispel . " Oh , come on , Mary Jo . " Chris smiled . " Do n't you know how those Ouija boards work ? It is n't anything at all but a person 's subconscious , that 's all . " " Yes , perhaps , " she answered quietly . " Perhaps . It could all be suggestion . But in story after story that I 've heard about seances , Ouija boards , all of that , they always seem to point to the opening of a door of some sort . Oh , not to the spirit world , perhaps ; you do n't believe in that . Perhaps , then , a door in what you call the subconscious . I do n't know . All I know is that things seem to happen . And , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world filled with people who dabbled in the occult . " " Are you kidding ? " There was momentary silence . Then again the soft voice began droning out of darkness . " There was a family in Bavaria , Chris , in nineteen twenty-one . I do n't remember the name , but they were a family of eleven . You could check it in the newspapers , I suppose . Just a short time following an attempt at a seance , they went out of their minds . All of them . All eleven . They went on a burning spree in their house , and when they 'd finished with the furniture , they started on the threemonth-oldbaby of one of the younger daughters . And that is when the neighbors broke in and stopped them. 76 " The entire family , " she ended , " was put in an asylum . " " Oh , boy ! " breathed Chris as she thought of Captain Howdy . He had now assumed a menacing coloration . Mental illness . Was that it ? Something . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " " Oh , for heaven sakes , " said Mrs. Perrin , stepping into the light , " you never mind about me ; you just listen to your doctor . " There was attempted reassurance in her voice that was not convincing . " I 'm great at the future "  --  Mrs. Perrin smiled  --  " but in the present I 'm absolutely helpless . " She was fumbling in her purse . " Now then , where are my glasses ? There , you see ? I 've mislaid them . Oh , here they are right here . " She had found them in a pocket of her coat . " Lovely home , " she remarked as she put on the glasses and glanced up at the upper facade of the house . " Gives a feeling of warmth . " " God almighty , I 'm relieved ! For a second , there , I thought you were going to tell me it 's haunted ! " Mrs. Perrin glanced down to her . " Why would I tell you a thing like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a noted actress in Beverly Hills who had sold her home because of her insistence that it was inhabited by a poltergeist . " I do n't know . " She grinned wanly . " On account of who you are , I guess . I was kidding . " " It 's a very fine house , " Mrs. Perrin reassured her in an even tone . " I 've been here before , you know ; many times . " " Have you really ? " " Yes , an admiral had it ; a friend of mine . I get a letter from him now and then . They 've shipped him to sea again , poor dear . I do n't know if it 's really him that I miss or this house . " She smiled . " But then maybe you 'll invite me back . " " Mary Jo , I 'd love to have you back . I mean it . You 're a fascinating person . " " Well , at least I 'm the nerviest person you know . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Please . Will you call me next week ? " 77ing at Regan , she remembered an incident when her daughter was only three : the night that Howard had decided she was much too old to continue to sleep with her baby bottle , on which she had grown dependent . He 'd taken it away from her that night , and Regan had screamed until four in the morning , then acted hysterical for days . And now Chris feared a similar reaction . Better wait until I talk it all out with a shrink . Moreover , the Ritalin , she reflected , had n't had a chance to take effect . At the last , she decided to wait and see . Chris retired to her room , settled wearily into bed , and almost instantly fell asleep . Then awakened to fearful , hys- terical screaming at the rim of her consciousness . " Mother , come here , cone here , I 'm afraid ! " " Yes , I 'm coming , all right , hon , I 'm coming ! " Chris raced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Crying . Sounds like bedsprings . " Oh , my baby , what 's wrong ? " Chris exclaimed as she reached out and flicked on the lights . Good Christ almighty ! Regan lay taut on her back , face stained with tears and con- torted with terror as she gripped at the sides of her narrow bed . " Mother , why is it shaking ? " she cried . " Make it stop ! Oh , I 'm scared ! Make it stop ! Mother , please make it stop ! " The mattress of the bed was quivering violently back and forth . " Yes , I would like to hear how your daughter 's coming on . " " Got the number ? " " Yes , at home in my book . " What was off ? wondered Chris . There was something in her tone that was slightly off-center . " Well , good night , " said Mrs. Perrin , " and thanks again for a marvelous evening . " And before Chris could answer her , she was walking rapidly down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and then closed the front door . A heavy lassitude overcame her . Quite a night , she thought ; some night . . . some night .. . She went to the living room and stood over Willie , who was kneeling by the urine stain . She was brushing up the nap of the rug . " White vinegar I put on , " muttered Willie . " Twice . " " Cowin ' out ? " " Maybe now , " answered Willie . " I do not know . We will see . " " No , you ca n't really tell until the damned thing dries . " Yeah , that 's brilliant there , punchy . That 's really a brilliant observation . Judas priest , kid , go to bed ! " C'm on , leave it alone for now , Willie . Get to sleep . " " No , I finish . " " Okay , then . And thanks . Good night . " " Good night , madam . " Chris started up the stairs with weary steps . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " " Yes , thank you , madam . " Chris looked in on Regan and found her still asleep . Then she remembered the Ouija board . Should she hide it ? Throw it away ? Boy , Perrin 's really dingy when it comes to that stuff . Yet Chris was aware that the fantasy playmate was morbid and unhealthy . Yeah , maybe I should chuck it . Still , Chris was hesitant . Standing by the bedside and look-7879one ... In our sleep , pain , which can not forget , falls drop by drop upon the heart until , in our own despair , against our will , comes wisdom through the awful grace of God . .. . AeschylusThey brought her to an ending in a crowded cemetery where the gravestones cried for breath . The Mass had been lonely as her life . Her brothers from Brooklyn . The grocer on the corner who 'd extended her credit . Watching them lower her into the dark of a world without windows , Damien Karras sobbed with a grief he had long misplaced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncle with an arm around his shoulder . " Never mind , she 's in heaven now , Dimmy , she 's happy . " Oh , God , let it be ! Ah , God ! Ah , please ! Oh , God , please be ! They waited in the car while he lingered by the grave . Hecould not bear the thought of her being alone . Driving to Pennsylvania Station , he listened to his uncles speak of their illnesses in broken , immigrant accents. " . . . emphysema . . . got ta quit smokin ' . . . I ohmos ' died las ' year , you know that ? " 83Spasms of rage fought to break from his lips , but he pressed them back and felt ashamed . He looked out the window : they were passing by the Home Relief Station where on Saturday mornings in the dead of winter she would pick up the milk and the sacks of potatoes while he lay in his bed ; the Central Park Zoo , where she left him in summer while she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Passing the hotel , Karras burst into sobs , and then choked back the memories , wiped at the wetness of stinging regrets . He wondered why love had waited for this distance , waited for the moment when he need not touch , when the limits of contact and human surrenderhad dwindled to the size of a printed Mass card tucked in his wallet : In Memoriam .. . IIc knew . This grief was old . IIe arrived at Georgetown in time for dinner , but had no appetite . He paced inside his cottage . Jesuit friends came by with condolences . Stayed briefly . Promised prayers . Shortly after ten , Joe Dyer appeared with a bottle of Scotch . He displayed it proudly : " Chivas Regal ! " " Where 'd you get the money for it  --  out of the poor-box ? " " Do n't be an asshole , that would be breaking my vow of poverty . " " Where did you get it , then ? " " I stole it . " Karras smiled and shook his head as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rinsed them out in his tiny bathroom sink and said , " I believe you . " " Greater faith I have never seen . " Karras felt a stab of familiar pain . He shook it off and returned to Dyer , who was sitting on his cot breaking open the seal . He sat beside him . " Would you like to absolve me now or later ? " " Just pour , " said Karras , " and we 'll absolve each other . " Dyer poured deep into glass and cup . " College presidents84should n't drink , " he murmured . " It sets a bad example . I figure I relieved him of a terrible temptation . " Karras swallowed Scotch , but not the story . He knew the president 's ways too well . A man of tact and sensitivity , he always gave through indirection . Dyer had come , he knew , as a friend , but also as the president 's personal emissary . So when Dyer made a passing comment about Karras possibly needing " a rest , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future and felt a momentary flood of relief . Dyer was good for him ; made him laugh ; talked about the party and Chris MacNeil ; purveyed new anecdotes about the Jesuit Prefect of Discipline . He drank very little , but continuallyreplenished Karras ' glass , and when he thought he was numb enough for sleep , he got up from the cot and made Karras stretch out , while he sat at the desk and continued to talk until Karras ' eyes were closed and his comments were mumbled grunts . Dyer stood up and undid the laces of Karras ' shoes . He slipped them off . " Gon na steal my shoes now ? " Karras muttered thickly . " No , I tell fortunes by reading the creases . Now shut up and go to sleep . " " You 're a Jesuit cat burglar . " Dyer laughed lightly and covered him with a coat that he took from a closet . " Listen , someone 's got to worry about the bills around this place . All you other guys do is rattle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Karras made no answer . His breathing was regular and deep . Dyer moved quietly to the door and flicked out the light . " Stealing is a sin , " muttered Karras in the darkness . " Mea culpa , " Dyer said softly . For a time he waited , then at last decided that Karras was asleep . He left the cottage . In the middle of the night , Karras awakened in tears . He had dreamed of his mother . Standing at a window high in85Manhattan , he 'd seen her emerging from a subway kiosk across the street . She stood at the curb with a brown paper shopping bag , searching for him . He waved . She did n't see him . She wandered the street . Buses . Trucks . Unfriendly crowds . She was growing frightened . She returned to the subwayand began to descend . Karras grew frantic , ran to the street and began to weep as he called her name ; as he could not find her ; as he pictured her helpless and bewildered in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waited for his sobbing to subside , and then fumbled for the Scotch . IIc sat on the cot and drank in darkness . Wet came the tears . They would not cease . This was like childhood , this grief . Ile remembered a telephone call from his uncle : " Dimmy , da edema 's affected her brain . She wo n't let a doctor conic anywhere near her . Jus ' keeps screamin ' things . Even talks ta da goddam radio . I figure she 's got ta go ta Bellevue , Dimmy . A regular hospital wo n't put up wit ' dat . I jus ' figure a coupla months an ' she 's good as new ; den we take her out again . Okay ? Lissen , Dimmy , I tell you : we awready done it . Dey give her a shot an ' den take her in da ambulance dis mornin ' . We didn ' wan na bodda you , excep ' dere is a hearin ' and you got ta sign da papers . Now . . . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dimmy ? You ? " He did n't remember falling asleep . He awakened in torpor , with memory of loss draining blood from his stomach . He reeled to the bathroom ; showered ; shaved ; dressed in a cassock . It was five-thirty-five . He unlocked the door to Holy Trinity , put on his vestments , and offered up Mass at the left side altar . " Memento etiam . . . " he prayed with bleak despair . " Rememberthy servant , Mary Karras .... " In the tabernacle door he saw the face of the nurse at Bellevue Receiving ; heard again the screams from the isolationroom. 86 " You her son ? " " Yes , I 'm Damien Karras . " " Well , I would n't go in there . She 's pitchin ' a fit . " He 'd looked through the port at the windowless room with the naked light bulb hanging from the ceiling ; padded walls ; stark ; no furniture save for the cot on which she raved. " ... grant her , we pray Thee , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she met his gaze , she 'd grown suddenly silent ; moved to the port with a baffled look . " Why you do this , Dimmy ? Why ? " The eyes had been meeker than a lamb 's . " Agnus Dei . . . " he murmured as he bowed and struck his breast . " Lamb of God , who takest away the sins of the world , grant her rest .... " As he closed his eyes and held the Host , he saw his mother in the hearing room , her hands clasped gentle in her lap , her expression docile and confused as the judge explained to her the Bellevue psychiatrist 's report . " Do you understand that , Mary ? " She 'd nodded ; would n't open her mouth ; they had taken her dentures . " Well , what do you say about that , Mary ? " She 'd proudly answered him : " My boy , he speak for me . " An anguished moan escaped from Karras as he bowed his head above the Host . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Domine , non sum dignus . . . . I am not worthy . . . say but the word and my soul shall be healed . " Against all reason , against all knowledge , he prayed there was Someone to hear his prayer . He did not think so . After the Mass , he returned to the cottage and tried to sleep . Without success . Later in the morning , a youngish priest that he 'd never87seen came by unexpectedly . He knocked and looked in the door . " You busy ? Can I see you for a while ? " In the eyes , the restless burden ; in the voice , the tugging plea . For a moment , Karras hated him . " Come in , " he said gently . And inwardly raged at this portion of his being that rendered him helpless ; that he could not control ; that lay coiled within him like a length of rope , always ready to fling itself unbidden at the cry of someone else 's need . It gave him no peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his dreams , there was often a sound like a faint , brief cry of someone in distress . It was almost inaudible in the distance . Always the same . And for minutes after waking , he would feel the anxiety of some duty unfulfilled . The young priest fumbled ; faltered ; seemed shy . Karras led him patiently . Offered cigarettes . Instant coffee . Then forced a look of interest as the moody young visitor gradually unfoldeda familiar problem : the terrible loneliness of priests . Of all the anxieties that Karras encountered among the community , this one had lately become the most prevalent . Cut off from their families as well as from women , many of the Jesuits were also fearful of expressing affection for fellow priests ; of forming deep and loving friendships . " Like I 'd like to put my arm around another guy 's shoulder , but right away I 'm scared he 's going . to think I 'm queer . I mean , you hear all these theories about so many latents attracted to the priesthood . So I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to somebody 's room just to listen to records ; or talk ; or smoke . It 's not that I 'm afraid of him ; I 'm just worried about him getting worried about inc . " Karras felt the weight casing slowly from the other and onto him . He let it come ; let the young priest talk . He knew he would return again and again ; find relief from aloneness ; make Karras his friend ; and when he 'd realized he had done so88without fear and suspicion , perhaps he would go on to make friends among the others . The psychiatrist grew weary ; found himself drifting into private sorrow . He glanced at a plaque that someone hadgiven him the previous Christmas . MY BROTHER HURTS . I SHARE HIS PAIN . I MEET GOD IN HIM , he read . A failed encounter . Heblamed himself . He had mapped the streets of his brother 's torment , yet never had walked them ; or so he believed . He thought that the pain which he felt was his own . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was time for lunch in the campus refectory . He rose and started to leave . Then paused to glance at a current novel on Karras ' desk . " Have you read it ? " asked Karras . The other shook his head . " No , I have n't . Should I ? " " I do n't know . I just finished it and I 'm not at all sure that I really understand it , " Karras lied . He picked up the book and handed it over . " Want to take it along ? You know , I 'd really like to hear someone else 's opinion . " " Well , sure , " said the Jesuit , examining the copy on the flap of the dust jacket . " I 'll try to get it back to you in a couple of days . " His mood seemed brighter . As the screen door creaked with his departure , Karras felt momentary peace . He picked up his breviary and stepped out to the courtyard , where he slowly paced and said his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visitor , the elderly pastor of Holy Trinity , who took a chair by the desk and offered condolences on the passing of Karras ' mother . " Said a couple of Masses for her , Damien . And one for you , " he wheezed with the barest trace of a brogue . " That was thoughtful of you , Father . Thank you very much . " " How old was she ? " " Seventy . " " A good old age . " 89Karras fixed his gaze on an altar card that the pastor had carried in with him . One of three employed in the Mass , it was covered in plastic and inscribed with a portion of the prayers that were said by the priest . The psychiatrist wondered what he was doing with it . " Well , Damien , we 've had another one of those things here today . In the church , y'know . Another desecration . " A statue of the Virgin at the back of the church had been painted like a harlot , the pastor told him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And this one the morning after you 'd gone , y'know , to New York . Was it Saturday ? Saturday . Yes . Well , take a look at that . I just had a talk with a sergeant of police , and  --  well . . . well , look at this card , would you , Damien ? " As Karras examined it , the pastor explained that someone had slipped in a typewritten sheet between the original card and its cover . The ersatz text , though containing some strikeoversand various typographical errors , was in basically fluent and intelligible Latin and described in vivid , erotic detail an imagined homosexual encounter involving the Blessed Virgin Mary and Mary Magdalene . " That 's enough , now , you do n't have to read it all , " said the pastor , snapping back the card as if fearing that it might be an occasion of sin . " Now that 's excellent Latin ; I mean , it 's got style , a church Latin style . Well , the sergeant says he talked to some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person 's been doin ' this all  --  well , he could be a priest , y'know , a very sick priest . Do you think ? " The psychiatrist considered for a while . Then nodded . " Yes . Yes , it could . Acting out a rebellion , perhaps , in a state of complete somnambulism . I do n't know . It could be . Maybe so . " Can you think of any candidates , Damien ? " " I do n't get you . " " Well , now , sooner or later they come and see you , wouldn't90you say ? I mean , the sick ones , if there are any , from the campus . Do y'know any like that ? I mean with that kind of illness , y'know . " " No , I do n't . " " No , I did n't think you 'd tell me . " " Well , I would n't know anyway , Father . Somnambulism is a way of resolving any number of possible conflict situations , and the usual form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And if it is a somnambulist , he 's probably got a complete posterior amnesia about what he 's done , so that even he would n't have a clue . " " What if you were to tell him ? " the pastor asked cagily . He plucked at an earlobe , a habitual gesture , Karras had noticed , whenever he thought he was being wily . " I really do n't know , " repeated the psychiatrist . " No . No , I really did n't think that you 'd tell me . " He rose and moved for the door . " Y'know what you 're like , you people ? Like priests ! " he complained . As Karras laughed gently , the pastor returned and dropped the altar card on his desk . " I suppose you should study this thing , " he mumbled . " Something might come to you . " The pastor moved for the door . " Did they check it for fingerprints ? " asked Karras . The pastor stopped and turned slightly . " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a criminal we 're after , now , is it ? More likely it 's only a demented parishioner . What do you think of that , Damien ? Do you think that it could be someone in the parish ? You know , I think so . It was n't a priest at all , it was someone among the parishioners . " He was pulling at his earlobe again . " Do n't you think ? " " I really would n't know , " he said again . " No , I did n't think you 'd tell me . " Later that day , Father Karras was relieved of his duties as counselor and assigned to the Georgetown University Medical School as lecturer in psychiatry . His orders were to " rest . " 91twoRegan lay on her back on Klein 's examiningtable , arms and legs bowed outward . Taking her foot in both his hands , the doctor flexed it toward her ankle . For moments he held it there in tension , then suddenly released it . The foot relaxed into normal position . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the result . He seemed dissatisfied . When Regan abruptly sat up and spat in his face , he instructed a nurse to remain in the room and returned to his office to talk to Chris . It was April 26 . He 'd been out of the city both Sunday and Monday and Chris had n't reached him until this morning to relate the happening at the party and the subsequent shakingof the bed . " It was actually moving ? " " It was moving . " " How long ? " 92 " I do n't know . Maybe ten , maybe fifteen seconds . I mean , that 's all I saw . Then she sort of went still and wet the bed . Or maybe she 'd wet it before . I do n't know . But then all of a sudden she was dead asleep and never woke up till the next afternoon . " Dr. Klein entered thoughtfully . " Well , what is it ? " Chris asked in an anxious tone . When she 'd first arrived , he 'd reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caused by a seizure of clonic contractions , an alternating tensing and relaxing of the muscles . The chronic form of such a condition , he 'd told her , was clonus , and usually indicated a lesion in the brain . " Well , the test was negative , " he told her , and described the procedure , explaining that in clonus the alternate flexing and releasing of the foot would have triggered a run of clonic contractions . As he sat at his desk , he still seemed worried , however . " Has she ever had a fall ? " " Like on the head ? " Chris asked . " Well , yes . " " No , not that I know of . " " Childhood diseases ? " " Just the usual . Measles and mumps and chicken pox . " " Sleepwalking history ? " " Not until now . " " What do you mean ? She was walking in her sleep at the party ? " " Well , yes . She still does n't know what she did that night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she does n't remember . " " Lately ? " Sunday . Regan still sleeping , An overseas telephone call from Howard . " How 's Rags ? " " Thanks a lot for the call on her birthday . " " I was stuck on a yacht . Now for chrissakes lay off me . I called her the minute I was back in the hotel . " 93 " Oh , sure . " " She did n't tell you ? " " You talked to her ? " " Yes . That 's why I thought I 'd better call you . What the heIl 's going on with her ? " " What are you getting at ? " " She just called me a cocksucker ' and hung up the phone . " Recounting the incident to Dr. Klein , Chris explained that when Regan had finally awakened , she had no memory whateverof either the telephone call or of what had happened on the night of the dinner . " Then perhaps she was n't lying about the moving of the furniture , " Klein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , she moved it herself , no doubt , but perhaps while in one of those states where she did n't really know what she was doing . It 's known as automatism . Like a trance state . The patient does n't know or remember what he 's doing . " " But something just occurred to me , doe , you know that ? There 's a great big heavy bureau in her room made out of teakwood . It must weigh half a ton . I mean , how could she have moved that ? " " Extraordinary strength is pretty common in pathology . " " Oh , really ? How come ? " The doctor shrugged . " No one knows . " " Now , besides what you 've told me , " he continued , " have you noticed any other bizarre behavior ? " " Well , she 's gotten real sloppy . " " Bizarre , " he repeated . " For her , that 's bizarre . Oh , now wait ! There 's this ! You remember that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " The fantasy playmate . " The internist nodded . " Well , now she can hear him , " Chris revealed . The doctor leaned forward , folding his arms atop the desk. 94As Chris continued , his eyes were alert and had narrowed to dart points of speculation . " Yesterday morning , " said Chris , " I could hear her talking to Howdy in her bedroom . I mean , she 'd talk , and then seem to wait , as if she were playing with the Ouija board . When I peeked inside the room , though , there was n't any Ouija board there ; just Rags ; and she was nodding her head , doe , just like she was agreeing with what he was saying . " " Did she see him ? " " I do n't think so . She sort of had her head to the side , the way she does when she listens to records . " The doctor nodded thoughtfully . " Yes . Yes , I see . Any other phenomena like that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smell , " Chris remembered . " She keeps smelling something bad in her bedroom . " " Something burning ? " " Hey , that 's right ! " Chris exclaimed . " How 'd you know that ? " " It 's sometimes the symptom of a type of disturbance in the chemicoelectrical activity of the brain . In the case of your daughter , in the temporal lobe , you see . " He put a hand to the front of his skull . " Up here , in the forward part of the brain . Now it 's rare but it does cause bizarre hallucinations and usually just before a convulsion . I suppose that 's why it 's taken for schizophrenia so often ; but it is n't schizophrenia . It 's produced by a lesion in the temporal lobe . Now the test for clones is n't conclusive , Mrs. MacNeil , so I think I 'd like to give her an EEG . " " What 's that ? " " Electroencephalograph . It will show us the pattern of her brain waves . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But you think that 's it , huh ? Temporal lobe ? " " Well , she does have the syndrome , Mrs. MacNeil . For95example , the untidiness ; the pugnacity ; behavior that 's socially embarrassing ; the automatism , as well . And of course , the seizures that made the bed shake . Usually , that 's followed by either wetting the bed or vomiting , or both , and then sleeping very deeply . " " You want to test her right now ? " asked Chris . " Yes , I think we should do it immediately , but she 's going to need sedation . If she moves or jerks it will void the results , so may I give her , say , twenty-five milligrams of Librium ? " " Jesus , do what you have to , " she told him , shaken . She accompanied him to the examining room , and when Regan saw him readying the hypodermic , she screamed and filled the air with a torrent of obscenities . " Oh , honey , it 's to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held Regan still while Dr. Klein gave the injection . " I 'll be back , " the doctor said , nodding , and while a nurse wheeled the EEG apparatus into the room , he left to attend another patient . When he returned a short time later , the Librium still had not taken effect . Klein seemed surprised . " That was quite a strong dose , " he remarked to Chris . He injected another twenty-five milligrams ; left ; came back ; found Regan tractable and docile . " What are you doing ? " Chris asked him as Klein applied the saline-tipped electrodes to Regan 's scalp . " We put four on each side , " he explained . " That enables us to take a brain-wave reading from the left and right side of the brain and then compare them . " " Why compare them ? " " Well , deviations could be significant . For example , I had a patient who used to hallucinate , " said Klein . " He 'd see things , he 'd hear things , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , I found a discrepancy in comparing the left and right readings of his brain waves and discovered that actuallythe man was hallucinating on just one side of his head . " 96 " That 's wild . " " The left eye and ear functioned normally ; only the right side had visions and heard things . " Well , all right , now , let 's see . " He had turned the machine on . He pointed to the waves on the fluorescent screen . " Now that 's both sides together , " he explained . " What I 'm looking for now are spiky waves "  --  he patterned in the air with his index finger  --  " especially waves of very high amplitude coming at four to eight per second . That 's temporal lobe , " he told her . He studied the pattern of the brain wave carefully , but discoveredno dysrhythmia . No spikes . No flattened domes . And when he switched to comparison readings , the results were also negative . Klein frowned . He could n't understand it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He brought in a nurse to attend to Regan and returned to his office with her mother . " So what 's the story ? " Chris inquired . The doctor sat pensively on the edge of his desk . " Well , the EEG would have proved that she had it , but the lack of dysrhythmia does n't prove to me conclusively that she does n't . It might be hysteria , but the pattern before and after her convulsionwas much too striking . " Chris furrowed her brow . " You know , you keep on saying that , doc  --  ' convulsion . ' What exactly is the name of this dis-ease ? " " Well , it is n't a disease , " he said quietly . " Well , what do you call it ? I mean , specifically . " " You know it as epilepsy , Mrs. MacNeil . " " Oh , my God ! " Chris sank to a chair . " Now , let 's hold it , " soothed Klein . " I can see that like most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and probably largely mythical . " 97 " Is n't it hereditary ? " Chris said , wincing . " That 's one of the myths , " Klein told her calmly . " At least , most doctors seem to think so . Look , practically anyone can be made to convulse . You see , most of us are born with a pretty high threshold of resistance to convulsions ; some with a low one ; so the difference between you and an epileptic is a matter of degree . That 's all . Just degree . It is not a disease . " " Then what is it  --  a freaking hallucination ? " " A disorder : a controllable disorder . And there are many , many types of it , Mrs. MacNeil . For example , you 're sitting here now and for a second you seem to go blank , let 's say , and you miss a little bit of what I 'm saying . Well , now that 's a kind of epilepsy , Mrs. MacNeil . That 's right . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that is n't Regan , " Chris rebutted . " And how come it 's happening just all of a sudden ? " " Look , we still are n't sure that 's what she 's got , and I grant you that maybe you were right in the first place ; very possibly it 's psychosomatic . However , I doubt it . And to answer your question , any number of changes in the function of the brain can trigger a convulsion in the epileptic : worry ; fatigue ; emotionalstress ; a particular note on a musical instrument . I once had a patient , for instance , who never used to have a seizure except on a bus when he was a block away from home . Well , we finally discovered what was causing it : flickering light from a white slat fence reflected in the window of the bus . Now at another time of day , or if the bus had been going at a different speed , he would n't have convulsed , you see . He had a lesion , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease . In the case of your daughter , the scar would be forward  --  up front in the temporal lobe  --  and when it 's hit by a particular electrical impulse of a certain wavelength and periodicity , it triggers a sudden burst of abnormal reactions from deep within a focus in the lobe . Do you see ? " " I guess , " Chris sighed , dejected . " But I 'll tell you the98truth , doe , I do n't understand how her whole personality could be changed . " " In temporal lobe , that 's extremely common , and can last for days or even weeks . It is n't rare to find destructive and even criminal behavior . There 's such a big change , in fact , that two or three hundred years ago people with temporal lobe disorders were often considered to be possessed by a devil . " " They were what ? " " Taken over by the mind of a demon . You know , something like a superstitious version of split personality . " Chris closed her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tell me something good , " she murmured . " Well , now , do n't be alarmed . If it is a lesion , in a way she 's fortunate . Then all we have to do is remove the scar . " " Oh , swell . " " Or it could be just pressure on the brain . Look , I 'd like to have some X rays taken of her skull . There 's a radiologist here in the building , and perhaps I can get him to take you right away . Shall I call him ? " " God , yes ; go ahead ; let 's do it . " Klein called and set it up . They would take her immediately , they told him . He hung up the phone and began writing a prescription . " Room twenty-one on the second floor . Then I 'll probably call you tomorrow or Thursday . I 'd like a neurologist in on this . In the meantime , I 'm taking her off the Ritalin . Let 's try her on Librium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the pad and handed it over . " I 'd try to stay close to her , Mrs. MacNeil . In these walking trance states , if that 's what it is , it 's always possible for her to hurt herself . Is your bedroom close to hers ? " " Yeah , it is . " " That 's fine . Ground floor ? " " No , second . " " Big windows in her bedroom ? " 99 " Well , one . What 's the deal ? " " Well , I 'd try to keep it closed , maybe even put a lock on it . In a trance state , she might go through it . I once had a  --  " "  --  Patient , " Chris finished with a trace of a wry , weary smile . He grinned . " I guess I do have a lot of them , do n't I ? " " A couple . " She propped her face on her hand and leaned thoughtfully forward . " You know , I thought of something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " 7e11 , like after a fit , you were saying , she 'd right away fall dead asleep . Like on Saturday night . I mean , did n't you say that ? " " Well , yes . " Klein nodded . " That 's right . " " Well , then , how come those other times she said that her bed was shaking , she was always wide awake ? " " You did n't tell me that . " " Well , it 's so . She looked just fine . She 'd just come to my room and then ask to get in bed with me . " " Bed wetting ? Vomiting ? " Chris shook her head . " She was fine . " Klein frowned and gently chewed on his lip for a moment . " Well , let 's look at those X rays , " he finally told her . Feeling drained and numb , Chris shepherded Regan to the radiologist ; stayed at her side while the X rays were taken ; took her home . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chris made an effort now to engage her . " Want to play some Monopoly or somethin ' ? " Regan shook her head and then stared at her mother with unfocused eyes that seemed to be retracted into infinite remoteness . " I 'm feeling sleepy , " Regan said in a voice that belonged to the eyes . Then , turning , she climbed up the stairs to her bedroom . Must be the Librium , Chris reflected as she watched her. iooThen at last she sighed and went into the kitchen . She poured some coffee and sat down at the breakfast-nook table with Sharon . " How 'd it go ? " " Oh , Christ ! " Chris fluttered the prescription slip onto the table . " Better call and get that filled . " she said , and then explained what the doctor had told her . " If I 'm busy or out , keep a real good eye on her , would you , Shar ? He  --  " Dawning . Sudden . " That . reminds me . " She got up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , found her under the covers and apparently asleep . Chris moved to the window and tightened the latch . She stared below . The window , facing out from the side of the house , directly overlooked the precipitous public staircase that plunged to M Street far below . Boy , I 'd better call a locksmith right away . Chris returned to the kitchen and added the chore to the list from which Sharon sat working , gave Willie the dinner menu , and returned a call from her agent . " What about the script ? " he wanted to know . " Yeah , it 's great , Ed ; let 's do it , " she told him . " When 's it go ? " " Well , your segment 's in July , so you 'll have to start preparingright away . " " You mean now ? " " I mean now . This is n't acting , Chris . You 're involved in a lot of the preproduction . You 've got to work with the set designer , the costume designer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll have to pick a cameraman and a cutter and block out your shots . C'm on , Chris , you know the drill . " " Oh , shit . " " You 've got a problem ? " " Yeah , I do ; I 've got a problem . " " What 's the problem ? " ioi " Well , Regan 's pretty sick . " " Oh , I 'm sorry . What 's wrong ? " " They do n't know yet . I 'm waiting for some tests . Listen , Ed , I ca n't leave her . " " So who says to leave her ? " " No , you do n't understand , Ed . I need to be at home with her . She needs my attention . Look , I just ca n't explain it , Ed , it 's too complicated , so why do n't we just hold off for a while ? " " We ca n't . They want to try for the Music Hall over Christmas , Chris , and I think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for chrissakes , Ed , they can wait two weeks . Now come on ! " " Look , you 've bugged me that you want to direct , and now all of a  --  " " Right , Ed , I know , " she interrupted . " Look , I want it ; I really want it bad , but you 'll just have to tell ' em that I need some more time ! " " And if I do , we 're going to blow it . Now that 's my opinion . Look , they do n't want you anyway , that 's not news . They 're just doing this for Moore , and I think if they go back to him now and say she is n't too sure she wants to do it yet , he 'll have an out . Now come on , Chris , talk sense . Look , you do what you want . I do n't care . There 's no money in this thing unless it hits . But if you want it , I 'm telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're going to blow it . Now then , what should I tell them ? " " Ahh , boy , " sighed Chris . " It 's not easy . I know . " " No , it is n't . Well , listen .. She thought . Then shook her head . " Ed , they 'll just have to wait , " she said wearily . " Your decision . " " Okay , Ed . Let me know . " " I will . I 'll be calling . Take it easy . " " You too , Ed . Good-bye . " She hung up the phone in a state of depression and lit up a cigarette . " I talked to Howard , by the way , did I tell you ? " she said to Sharon . " Oh , when ? Did you tell him what 's happening with Rags ? " " I told him . I told him he ought to come see her . " " Is he corning ? " " I do n't know . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd think he 'd make the effort . " " Yeah , I know . " Chris sighed . " But you 've got to understand his hang-up , Shar . That 's it . I know that 's it . " " What 's it ? " " Oh , the whole Mr. Chris MacNeil ' thing . Rags was a part of it . She was in and he was out . Always me and Rags together on the magazine covers ; me and Rags in the layouts ; mother and daughter , pixie twins . " She tipped ash from her cigarette with a moody finger . " Ah , nuts , who knows . It 's all mixed up . But it 's hard to get hacked with him , Shar ; I just ca n't . " She reached out for a book by Sharon 's elbow . " So what are you reading ? " " What do you mean ? Oh , that . That 's for you . I forgot . Mrs. Perrin dropped it by . " " She was here ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she missed you and she 's going out of town , but she 'll call you as soon as she 's back . " Chris nodded and glanced at the title of the book : A Study of Devil Worship and Related Occult Phenomena . She opened it and found a penned note from Mary Jo Perrin : Dear Chris : I happened by the Georgetown University Libraryand picked this up for you . It has some chapters about Black Mass . You should read it all , however ; I think you 'll find the other sections particularly interesting . See you soon . Mary Jo102103 " Sweet lady , " said Chris . " Yes , she is , " agreed Sharon . Chris riffled through the pages of the book . " What 's the scoop on Black Mass ? Pretty hairy ? " " I do n't know , " answered Sharon . " I have n't read it . " " No good for serenity ? " Sharon stretched and yawned . " Oh , that stuff turns me off . " " What happened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Chris slid the book across the table to Sharon . " Here , read it and tell me what happens . " " And get nightmares ? " " What do you think you get paid for ? " " Throwing up . " " I can do that myself , " Chris muttered as she picked up the evening paper . " All you have to do is stick your business manager 's advice down your throat and you 're vomiting blood for a week . " Irritably , she put the paper aside . " Would you turn on the radio , Shar ? Get the news . " Sharon had dinner at the house with Chris , and then left for a date . She forgot the book . Chris saw it on the table and thought about reading it , but finally she felt too weary . She left it on the table and walked upstairs . She looked in on Regan , who still seemed to be asleep under the covers , and apparently sleeping through . She checked the window again . Leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide open and then did the same with her own before getting into bed . She watched part of a movie on television . Then slept . The following morning , the book about devil worship had vanished from the table . No one noticed. 104threeThe consulting neurologist pinned up the X rays again and searched for indentations that would look as if the skull had been pounded like copper with a tiny hammer . Dr. Klein stood behind him with folded arms . They had both looked for lesions and collections of fluid ; for a possible shifting of the pineal gland . Now they probed for Liickenshadl Skull , the telltale depressions that would indicate chronic intracranialpressure . They did not find it . The date was Thursday , April 28 . The consulting neurologist removed his glasses and carefullytucked them into the left breast pocket of his jacket . " There 's just nothing there , Sam . Nothing I can see . " Klein frowned at the floor with a shake of the head . " Does n't figure . " " Want to run another series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll try an LP. " 105 " Good idea . " " In the meantime , I 'd like you to see her . " " How 's today ? " " Well , I 'm  --  " Telephone buzzer . " Excuse me . " He picked up the telephone . " Yes ? " " Mrs. MacNeil on the phone . Says it 's urgent . " " What line ? " " She 's on twelve . " He punched the extension button . " Dr. Klein , Mrs. MacNeil . What 's the trouble ? " Her voice was distraught and on the brim of hysteria . " Oh , God , doe , it 's Regan ! Can you come right away ? " " Well , what 's wrong ? " " I do n't know , doe , I just ca n't describe it ! Oh , for God 's sake , come over ! Come now ! " " Right away ! " Ile disconnected and buzzed his receptionist . " Susan , tell Dresncr to take my appointments . " I Ic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That 's her . You want to come ? It 's only just across the bridge . " " I 've got an hour . " " Let 's go . " They were there within minutes , and at the door , where Sharon greeted them , they heard moans and screams of terror from Regan 's bedroom . She looked frightened . " I 'm Sharon Spencer , " she said . " Come on . She 's upstairs . " She led them to the door of Regan 's bedroom , where she cracked it open and called in , " Doctors , Chris ! " Chris immediately came to the door , her face contorted in a vise of fear . " Oh , my God , conic on in ! " she quavered . " Come on in and take a look at what she 's doing ! " " This is Dr.  --  " In the middle of the introduction , Klein broke off as he stared at Regan . Shrieking hysterically , she was flailing herro6arms as her body seemed to fling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then slammed down savagely onto the mattress . It was happening rapidly and repeatedly . " Oh , Mother , make him stop ! " she was screeching . " Stop him . He 's trying to kill me ! Stop him ! St000pppppp hiiiiiimminmmnunm , Moth errrurrmarl " " Oh , my baby ! " Chris whimpered as she jerked up a fist to her mouth and bit it . She turned a beseeching look to Klein . " Doc , what is it ? What 's happening ? " He shook his head , his gaze fixed on Regan as the odd phenomenon continued . She would lift about a foot each time and then fall with a wrenching of her breath , as if unseen hands had picked her up and thrown her down . Chris shaded her eyes with a trembling hand . " Oh , Jesus , Jesus ! " she said hoarsely . " Doc , what is it ? " The up and down movements ceased abruptly and the girl twisted feverishly from side to side with her eyes rolled upwardinto their sockets so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's burning me . . . burning me ! " Regan was moaning . " Oh , I 'm burning ! I 'm burning ! ... " Her legs began rapidly crossing and uncrossing . The doctors moved closer , one on either side of the bed . Still twisting and jerking , Regan arched her head back , disclosinga swollen , bulging throat . She began to mutter **25;13369;TOOLONG in an oddly guttural tone. " ... nowonmai . . . nowonmai ... Klein reached down to check her pulse . " Now , let 's see what the trouble is , dear , " he said gently . And abruptly was reeling , stunned and staggering , across the room from the force of a vicious backward swing of Regan 's arm as the girl sat up , her face contorted with a hideous rage . " The sow is mine ! " she bellowed in a coarse and powerful voice . " She is mine ! Keep away from her ! She is mine ! " A yelping laugh gushed up from her throat , and then she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She pulled up107her nightgown , exposing her genitals . " Fuck me ! Fuck me ! " she screamed at the doctors , and with both her hands began masturbating frantically . Moments later , Chris ran from the room with a stifled sob when Regan put her fingers to her mouth and licked them . As Klein approached the bedside , Regan seemed to hug herself , her hands caressing her arms . " Ali , yes , my pearl . . . " she crooned in that strangely coarsenedvoice . I Icr eyes were closed as if in ecstasy . " My child .. . my flower . . . my pearl ... " Then again she was twisting from side to side , moaning meaningless syllables over and over . And abruptly sat up with eyes staring wide with helpless terror . She mewed like a cat . Then barked . ' Then neighed . And then , bending at the waist , started whirling her torso around in rapid , strenuous circles . She gasped for breath . " Oh , stop him ! " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Make him stop ! Make him stop ! I ca n't breathe ! " Klein had seen enough . He fetched his medical bag to the window and quickly began to prepare an injection . The neurologist remained beside the bed and saw Regan fall backward as if from a shove . Her eyes rolled upward into their sockets again , and rolling from side to side , she began to mutter rapidly in guttural tones . The neurologist leaned closer and tried to make it out . Then he saw Klein gently beckoning . He moved to him . " I 'm giving her Librium , " Klein told him guardedly , holding the syringe to the light of the window . " But you 're going to have to hold her . " The neurologist nodded . I-ie seemed preoccupied . He inclinedhis head to the side as if listening to the muttering from the bed . " What 's she saying ? " Klein whispered. 1o8 " I do n't know . Just gibberish . Nonsense syllables . " Yet his own explanation seemed to leave him unsatisfied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though . It 's got cadence . " Klein nodded toward the bed and they approached quietly from either side . As they came , she went rigid , as if in the stiffening grip of tetany , and the doctors looked at each other significantly . Then looked again to Regan as she started to arch her body upward into an impossible position , bending it backward like a bow until the brow of her head had touched her feet . She was screaming in pain . The doctors eyed each other with questioning surmise . Then Klein gave a signal to the neurologist . But before the consultant could seize her , Regan fell limp in a faint and wet the bed . Klein leaned over and rolled up her eyelid . Checked her pulse . " She 'll be out for a while , " he murmured . " I think she convulsed . Do n't you ? " " Yes , I think so . " " Well , let 's take some insurance , " said Klein . Deftly he administered the injection . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the consultant as he pressed a circle of sterile tape against the puncture . " Temporal lobe . Sure , maybe schizophrenia 's a possibility , Sam , but the onset 's much too sudden . She has n't any history of it , right ? " " No , she has n't . " " Neurasthenia ? " Klein shook his head . " Then hysteria , maybe , " offered the consultant . " I 've thought of that . " " Sure . But she 'd have to be a freak to get her body twisted up like she did voluntarily , now , would n't you say ? " He shook his head . " No , I think it 's pathological , Sam  --  her strength ; the paranoia ; the hallucinations . Schizophrenia , okay ; those symptoms it covers . But temporal lobe would also cover the109convulsions . There 's one thing that bothers me , though .... " He trailed off with a puzzled frown . " What 's that ? " " Well , I 'm really not sure but I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . my child ' . . . my flower ' . . . the sow . ' I had the feeling she was talking about herself . Was that your impression too , or am I reading something into it ? " Klein stroked his lip as he mulled the question . " Well , frankly , at the time it never occurred to me , but then now that you point it out . . . " He grunted thoughtfully . " Could be . Yes . Yes , it could . " Then he shrugged off the notion . " Well , I 'll do an LP right now while she 's out and then maybe we 'll know something . " The neurologist nodded . Klein poked around in his medical bag , found a pill and tucked it in his pocket . " Can you stay ? " The neurologist checked his watch . " Maybe half an hour . " " Let 's talk to the mother . " They left the room and entered the hallway . Chris and Sharon were leaning , heads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doctors , approached them , Chris wiped her nose with a balled , moist handkerchief . Her eyes were red from crying . " She 's sleeping , " Klein told her . " Thank God , " Chris sighed . " And she 's heavily sedated . She 'll probably sleep right through until tomorrow . " " That 's good , " Chris said weakly . " Doc , I 'm sorry about being such a baby . " " You 're doing just fine , " he assured her . " It 's a frightening ordeal . By the way , this is Dr. David . " " Hello , " said Chris with a bleak smile . " Dr. David 's a neurologist . " " What do you think ? " she asked them both. rro " Well , we still think it 's temporal lobe , " Klein answered , " and  --  " " Jesus , what in the hell are you talking about ! " Chris erupted . " She 's been acting like a psycho , like a split personality ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lowered her foreheadinto a hand . " Guess I 'm all up-tight . " She exhaled wearily . " I 'm sorry . " She lifted a haggard look to Klein . " You were saying ? " It was David who responded . " There have n't been more than a hundred authenticated cases of split personality , Mrs. MacNeil . It 's a rare condition . Now I know the temptation is to leap to psychiatry , but any responsible psychiatrist would exhaust the somatic possibilities first . That 's the safest pro-cedure . " " Okay , so what 's next ? " Chris sighed . " A lumbar tap , " answered David . " A spinal ? " He nodded . " What we missed in the X rays and the EEG could turn up there . At the least , it would exhaust certain other possibilities . I 'd like to do it now , right here , while she 's sleeping . I 'll give her a local , of course , but it 's movement I 'm trying to eliminate . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Chris asked , her face squinting up in anxiety . " Well , I think we discussed that before , " said Klein . " Pathologicalstates can induce abnormal strength and accelerated motor performance . " " But you do n't know why , " said Chris . " Well , it seems to have something to do with motivation , " commented David . " But that 's all we know . " " Well , now , what about the spinal ? " Klein asked Chris . " May we ? " She exhaled , sagging , staring at the floor. iii " Go ahead , " she murmured . " Do whatever you have to . Just make her well . " " We 'll try , " said Klein . " May I use your phone ? " " Sure , come on . In the study . " " Oh , incidentally , " said Klein as she turned to lead them , " she needs to have her bedding changed . " " I 'll do it , " said Sharon . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you some coffee ? " asked Chris as the doctors followed down the stairs . " I gave the housekeepers the afternoonoff , so it 'll have to be instant . " They declined . " I see you have n't fixed that window yet , " noted Klein . " No , we called , " Chris told him . " rIThey 're coining out tomorrowwith shutters you can lock . " Iie nodded approval . They entered the study , where Klein called his office and instructed an assistant to deliver the necessary equipment and medication to the house . " And set up the lab for a spinal workup , " Klein instructed . " I 'll run it myself right after the tap . " When he 'd finished the call , he turned to Chris and asked what had happened since last he saw Regan . " Well , Tuesday "  --  Chris pondered  --  " there was nothing at all . She went straight up to bed and slept right through until late the next morning , then  --  " " Oh , no , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she did n't . That 's right . Willie mentioned that she 'd heard her in the kitchen awfully early . I remember feeling glad that she 'd gotten her appetite back . But she went back to bed then , I guess , because she stayed there the rest of the day . " " She was sleeping ? " Klein asked her . " No , I think she was reading , " Chris answered . " Well , I started feeling a little better about it all . I mean , it looked as if the Librium was just what she needed . She was sort of far112away , I noticed , and that bothered me a little , but still it was a pretty big improvement . Well , last night , again , nothing , " Chris continued . " Then this morning it started . " She inhaled deeply . " Boy , did it start ! " She shook her head . She 'd been sitting in the kitchen , Chris told the doctors , when Regan ran screaming down the stairs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she clutched Chris 's arms and explained in a terrified voice that Captain Howdy was chasing her ; had been pinching her ; punching her ; shoving her ; mouthing obscenities ; threatening to kill her . " There he is ! " she had shrieked at last , pointing to the kitchen door . Then she 'd fallen to the floor , her body jerking in spasms as she gasped and wept that Howdy was kicking her . Then suddenly , Chris recounted , Regan had stood in the middle of the kitchen with arms extended and had begun to spin rapidly " like a top , " continuing the movements for several minutes , until she had fallen to the floor in exhaustion . " And then all of a sudden , " Chris finished distressfully , " I saw there was this . . . hate in her eyes , this hate , and she told me ... " She was choking up . " She called me a . . . Oh , Jesus ! " She burst into sobs , and shielded her eyes as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poured a glass of water from the tap . He walked toward Chris . " Oh , shit , where 's a cigarette ? " Chris sighed tremulously as she wiped at her eyes with the back of a finger . Klein gave her the water and a small green pill . " Try this instead , " he advised . " That a tranquilizer ? " " Yes . " " I 'll have a double . " " One 's enough . " 113 " Big spender , " Chris murmured with a wan smile . She swallowed the pill and then handed the empty glass to the doctor . " Thanks , " she said softly , and rested her brow on quivering fingertips . She shook her head gently . " Yeah , then it started , " she picked up moodily . " All of that other stuff . It was like she was someone else . " " Like Captain Howdy , perhaps ? " asked David . Chris looked up at him in puzzlement . He was staring so intently . " What do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know . " He shrugged . " Just a question . " She turned to the fireplace with absent , haunted eyes . " I do n't know , " she said dully . " Just somebody else . " There was a moment of silence . Then David stood up and explained he had to leave for another appointment , and after some reassuring statements , said good-bye . Klein walked him to the door . " You 'll check the sugar ? " David asked him . " No , I 'm the Rosslyn village idiot . " David smiled thinly . " I 'm a little up-tight about this myself , " he said . he looked away in thought . " Strange case . " For a moment he stroked his chin and seemed to brood . Then he looked up at Klein . " Let me know what you find . " " You 'll be hone ? " " Yes , I will . Give a call . " He waved a good-bye and left . A short time later , after the arrival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Novocain , and as Chris and Sharon watched , extracted the spinal fluid , keeping watch on the manometer . " Pressure 's normal , " he murmured . When he 'd finished , he went to the window to see if the fluid was clear or hazy . It was clear . He carefully stowed the tubes of fluid in his bag . " I doubt that she will , " Klein told the women , " but in case she awakens in the middle of the night and creates a dis-114turbance , you might want a nurse here to give her sedation . " " Ca n't I do it myself ? " Chris asked worriedly . " Why not a nurse ? " She did not want to mention her deep distrust of doctors and nurses . " I 'd rather do it myself , " she said simply . " Could n't I ? " " Well , injections are tricky , " he answered . " An air bubble 's very dangerous . " " Oh , I know how to do it , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in Oregon . " " Gee , would you do that , Shar ? Would you stay here tonight ? " Chris asked her . " Well , beyond tonight , " interjected Klein . " She may need intravenous feeding , depending on how she conies along . " " Could you teach me how to do it ? " Chris asked him anxiously . He nodded . " Yes , I guess I could . " He wrote a prescription for soluble Thorazine and disposable syringes . He gave it to Chris . " Have this filled right away . " Chris handed it to Sharon . " Honey , do that for me , would you ? Just call and they 'll send it . I 'd like to go with the doctor while he makes those tests . . . . Do you mind ? " she asked him . He noted the tightness around her eyes ; the look of confusion and of helplessness . He nodded . " I know how you feel . " He smiled at her gently . " I feel the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They left the house at precisely 6:18 P.M.In his laboratory in the Rosslyn medical building , Klein ran a number of tests . First he analyzed protein content . Normal . Then a count of blood cells . " Too many red , " Klein explained , " means bleeding . And too many white would mean infection . " He was looking in particular for a fungus infection that was115often the cause of chronic bizarre behavior . And again drew a blank . At the last , Klein tested the fluid 's sugar content . " How come ? " Chris asked him intently . " Well , now , the spinal sugar , " he told her , " should measure two-thirds of the amount of blood sugar . Anything significantly under that ratio would mean a disease in which the bacteria eat the sugar in the spinal fluid . And if so , it could account for her symptoms . " But he failed to find it . Chris shook her head and folded her arms . " Here we are again , folks , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then at last he turned and looked to Chris . " Do you keep any drugs in your house ? " he asked her . " Huh ? " " Amphetamines ? LSD ? " " Gee , no . Look , I 'd tell you . No , there 's nothing like that . " he nodded and stared at his shoes , then looked up and said , " Well  --  I guess that it 's time we consulted a psychiatrist , Mrs. MacNeil . " She was back in the house at exactly 7:21 r.m. , and at the door she called , " Sharon ? " Sharon was n't there . Chris went upstairs to Regan 's bedroom . Still heavily asleep . Not a ruffle in her covers . Chris noticed that the window was open wide . An odor of urine . Sharon must 've opened it to air out the room , she thought . She closed it . Where did she go ? Chris returned downstairs just as Willie came in . " Hi ya , Willie . Any fun today ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Willie made a gesture of dismissal . " He lets me see the Beatles this time . By myself . " 116 " Good work . " Willie held up her fingers in a V. The time was 7:35 . At 8:01 , while Chris was in the study talking to her agent on the phone , Sharon walked through the door with several packages , and then flopped in a chair and waited . " Where 've you been ? " asked Chris when she 'd finished . " Oh , did n't he tell you ? " " Oh , did n't who tell me ? " " Burke . Is n't he here ? Where is he ? " " He was here ? " " You mean he was n't when you got home ? " " Listen , start all over , " said Chris . " Oh , that nut , " Sharon chided with a headshake . " I could n't get the druggist to deliver , so when Burke came around , I thought , fine , he can stay here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She shrugged . " I should have known . " " Yeah , you should 've . And so what did you buy ? " " Well , since I thought I had the time , I went and bought a rubber drawsheet for her bed . " She displayed it . " Did you eat ? " " No , I thought I 'd fix a sandwich . Would you like one ? " " Good idea . Let 's go and eat . " " What happened with the tests ? " Sharon asked as they walked slowly to the kitchen . " Not a thing . All negative . I 'm going to have to get her a shrink , " Chris answered dully . After sandwiches and coffee , Sharon showed Chris how to give an injection . " The two main things , " she explained , " are to make sure that there are n't any air bubbles , and then you make sure that you have n't hit a vein . See , you aspirate a little , like this "  --  she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the syringe . " For a time , Chris practiced the procedure on a grapefruit , 117and seemed to grow proficient . Then at 9:28 , the front doorbellrang . Willie answered . It was Karl . As he passed through the kitchen , en route to his room , he nodded a good evening and remarked he 'd forgotten to take his key . " I ca n't believe it , " Chris said to Sharon . " That 's the first time he 's ever admitted a mistake . " They passed the evening watching television in the study . At 11:46 , Chris answered the phone . The young director of the second unit . He sounded grave . " Have you heard the news yet , Chris ? " " No , what ? " " Well , it 's bad . " " What is it ? " she asked . " Burke 's dead . " I-he 'd been drunk . He had stumbled . He had fallen down the steep flight of steps beside the house , fallen far to the bottom , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into night without end . A broken neck . This bloody , crumpled scene , his last . As the telephone fell from Chris 's fingers , she was silently weeping , standing unsteadily . Sharon ran and caught her , supportedher , hung up the phone and led her to the sofa . " Burke 's dead , " Chris sobbed . " Oh , my God ! " gasped Sharon . " What happened ? " But Chris could not speak yet . She wept . Then , later , they talked . For hours . They talked . Chris drank . Reminisced about Dennings . Now laughed . Now cried . " All , my God , " she kept sighing . " Poor Burke . . . poor Burke ... " Her dream of death kept coming back to her . At a little past five in the morning , Chris was standing moodily behind the bar , her elbows propped , head lowered , eyes sad . She was waiting for Sharon to return from the kitchen with a tray of ice . She heard her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sharon was sighing as she entered the study . Chris looked up and froze . Gliding spiderlike , rapidly , close behind Sharon , her body arched backward in a bow with her head almost touching her feet , was Regan , her tongue flicking quickly in and out of her mouth while she hissed sibilantly like a serpent . " Sharon ? " Chris said numbly , still staring at Regan . Sharon stopped . So did Regan . Sharon turned and saw nothing . And then screamed as she felt Regan 's tongue snaking out at her ankle . Chris whitened . " Call that doctor and get him out of bed ! Get him now ! " Wherever Sharon moved , Regan would follow. 119fourFriday , April 29 . While Chris waited in the hall outside the bedroom , Dr. Klein and a noted neuropsychiatristwere examining Regan . The doctors observed for half an hour . Flinging . Whirling . Tearing at the hair . She occasionally grimaced and pressed her hands against her ears as if blotting out sudden , deafening noise . She bellowed obscenities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself face downward onto the bed and tucked her legs up under her stomach . She moaned incoherently . The psychiatrist motioned Klein away from the bed . " Let 's get her tranquilized , " he whispered . " Maybe I can talk to her . " The internist nodded and prepared an injection of fifty milligramsof Thorazine . When the doctors approached the bed , however , Regan seemed to sense them and quickly turned over , and as the neuropsychiatrist attempted to hold her , she120began to shriek in malevolent fury . Bit him . Fought him . I Ield him off . It was only when Karl was called in to assist that they managed to keep her sufficiently rigid for Klein to administer the injection . The dosage proved inadequate . Another fifty milligrams was injected . They waited . Regan grew tractable . Then dreamy . Then stared at the doctors in sudden bewilderment . " Where 's Mom ? I want my Mom ! " she wept . At a nod from the neuropsychiatrist , Klein left the room to go and get Chris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second , dear , " the psychiatristtold Regan . He sat on the bed and stroked her head . " There , there , it 's all right , dear , I 'm a doctor . " " I want Morn ! " wept Regan . " She 's coming . Do you hurt , dear ? " She nodded , the tears streaming down . " Where ? " " Just every place ! " sobbed Regan . " I feel all achy ! " " Oh , my baby ! " " Mom ! " Chris ran to the bed and hugged her . Kissed her . Comforted and soothed . Then Chris herself began to weep . " Oh , Rags , you 're back ! It 's really you ! " " Oh , Mom , he hurt me ! " Regan sniffled . " Make him stop hurting me ! Please ? Okay ? " Chris looked puzzled for a moment , then glanced to the doctors with a pleading question in her eyes . " She 's heavily sedated , " the psychiatrist said gently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut her off . " We 'll see . " Then he turned to Regan . " Can you tell me what 's wrong , dear ? " " I do n't know , " she answered . " I do n't know why he does it to me . " Tears rolled down from her eyes . " He was always my friend before ! " 121 " Who 's that ? " " Captain Howdy ! And then it 's like somebody else is inside me ! Making me do things ! " " Captain Howdy ? " " I do n't know ! " " A person ? " She nodded . " Who ? " " I do n't know ! " " Well , all right , then ; let 's try something , Regan . A game . " IIc was reaching in his pocket for a shining bauble attached to a silvery length of chain . " I lave you ever seen movies where someone gets hypnotized ? " She nodded . " Well , I 'm a hypnotist . Oh , yes ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , if they let inc . Now I think if I hypnotizeyou , Regan , it will help you get well . Yes , that person inside you will come right out . Would you like to be hypnotized ? See , your mother 's right here , right beside you . " Regan looked questioningly to Chris . " Go ahead , honey , do it , " Chris urged her . " Try it . " Regan turned to the psychiatrist and nodded . " Okay , " she said softly . " But only a little . " The psychiatrist smiled and glanced abruptly to the sound of pottery breaking behind him . A delicate vase had fallen to the floor from the top of a bureau where Dr. Klein was now resting his forearm . He looked at his arm and then down at the shards with an air of puzzlement ; then stooped to pick them up . " Never mind , doe , Willic 'll get it , " Chris told him . " Would you close those shutters for me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drapes ? " When the room was dark , the psychiatrist gripped the chain in his fingertips and began to swing the bauble back and forth with an easy movement . He shone a penlight on it . It glowed. 122He began to intone the hypnotic ritual . " Now watch this , Regan , keep watching , and soon you 'll feel your eyelids growingheavier and heavier .... " Within a very short time , she seemed to be in trance . " Extremely suggestible , " the psychiatrist murmured . Then he spoke to the girl . " Are you comfortable , Regan ? " " Yes . " Her voice was soft and whispery . " How old are you , Regan ? " " Twelve . " " Is there someone inside you ? " " Sometimes . " " When ? " " Different times . " " It 's a person ? " " Yes . " " Who is it ? " " I do n't know . " " Captain Howdy ? " " I do n't know . " " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But he 's there . " " Yes , sometimes . " " Now ? " " I do n't know . " " If I ask him to tell me , will you let him answer ? " " No ! " " Why not ? " " I 'm afraid ! " " Of what ? " " I do n't know ! " " If he talks to me , Regan , I think he will leave you . Do you want him to leave you ? " " Yes . " " Let him speak , then . Will you let him speak ? " 123A pause . Then , " Yes . " " I am speaking to the person inside of Regan now , " the psychiatrist said firmly . " If you are there , you too are hypnotizedand must answer all my questions . " For a moment , he paused to allow the suggestion to enter her bloodstream . Then he repeated it : " If you are there , then you are hypnotized and must answer all my questions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Silence . Then something curious happened : Regan 's breath turned suddenly foul . It was thick , like a current . The psychiatristsmelled it from two feet away . He shone the penlight on Regan 's face . Chris stifled a gasp . Her daughter 's features were contorting into a malevolent mask : lips pulling tautly into opposite directions , tumefied tongue lolling wolfish from her mouth . " Oh , my God ! " breathed Chris . " Are you the person in Regan ? " the psychiatrist asked . She nodded . " Who are you ? " " Nowonmai , " she answered gutturally . " That 's your name ? " She nodded . " You 're a man ? " She said , " Say . " " Did you answer ? " " Say . " " If that 's yes , ' nod your head . " She nodded . " Are you speaking in a foreign language ? " " Say . " " Where do you come from ? " " Dog . " " You say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Regan replied . The psychiatrist thought for a moment , then attempted anotherapproach . " When I ask you questions now , you will an-swer by moving your head : a nod for yes , ' and a shake for no . ' Do you understand that ? " Regan nodded . " Did your answers have meaning ? " he asked her . Yes . " Are you someone whom Regan has known ? " No . " That she knows of ? " No . " Are you someone she 's invented ? " No . " You 're real ? " Yes . " Part of Regan ? " No . " Were you ever a part of Regan ? " No . " Do you like her ? " No . " Dislike her ? " Yes . " Do you hate her ? " Yes . " Over something she 's done ? " Yes . " Do you blame her for her parents ' divorce ? " No . " Has it something to do with her parents ? " No . " With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . " Yes . " Are you punishing Regan ? " Yes . " You wish to harm her ? " Yes . " To kill her ? " Yes . " If she died , would n't you die too ? " No . The answer seemed to disquiet him and he lowered his eyes in thought . The bed springs squeaked as he shifted his weight . In the smothering stillness , Regan 's breathing rasped as from a rotted , putrid bellows . Here . Yet far . Distantly sinister . The psychiatrist lifted his glance again to that hideous , twisted face . His eyes gleamed sharply with speculation . " Is there something she can do that would make you leave her ? " Yes . " Can you tell me what it is ? " Yes . " Will you tell me ? " No . " But  --  " Abruptly the psychiatrist gasped in startled pain as he real-125124ized with horrified incredulity that Regan was squeezing his scrotum with a hand that had gripped him like an iron talon . Eyes wide-staring , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sam ! Sam , help me ! " he croaked . Agony . Bedlam . Chris looking up and then leaping for the light switch . Klein running forward . Regan with her head back , cackling demonically , then howling like a wolf . Chris slapped at the light switch . Turned . Saw grainy , flickering film of a slow-motion nightmare : Regan and the doctors writhing on the bed in a tangle of shifting arms and legs , in a melee of grimaces , gasps and curses , and the howling and the yelping and the hideous laughter , with Regan oinking , Regan neighing , then the film racing faster and the bedstead shaking , violently quivering from side to side as Chris watched helplessly while her daughter 's eyes rolled upward into their sockets and she wrenched up a keening shriek of terror torn raw and bloody from the base of her spine . Regan crumpled and fell unconscious . Something unspeakableleft the room . For a breathless moment , no one moved . Then slowly and carefully , the doctors untangled themselves ; stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the expressionless Klein took Regan 's pulse . Satisfied , he slowly pulled up her blanket and nodded to the others . They left the room and went down to the study . For a time , no one spoke . Chris was on the sofa . Klein and the psychiatrist sat near her in facing chairs . The psychiatrist was pensive , pinching at his lip as he stared at the coffee table ; then he sighed and looked up at Chris . She turned her burnedoutgaze to his . " What the hell 's going on ? " she asked in a mournful , haggard whisper . " Did you recognize the language she was speaking ? " he asked her. 126Chris shook her head . " Have you any religion ? " " No . " " Your daughter ? " " No . " And now the psychiatrist asked her a lengthy series of questionsrelating to Regan 's psychological history . When at last he had finished , he seemed disturbed . " What is it ? " Chris asked him , white-knuckled fingers clenching and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got ? " " Well , it 's somewhat confusing , " the psychiatrist evaded . " And frankly , it would be quite irresponsible of me to attempt a diagnosis after so brief an examination . " " Well , you must have some idea , " she insisted . The psychiatrist sighed , fingering his brow . " Well , I know you 're quite anxious , so I will mention one or two tentative impressions . " Chris leaned forward , nodding tensely . Fingers in her lap started fumbling with the handkerchief , telling the stitches in the hem as if they were wrinkled linen rosary beads . " To begin with , " he told her , " it 's highly improbable that she 's faking . " Klein was nodding in agreement . " We think so for a numberof reasons , " the psychiatrist continued . " For example , the abnormal and painful contortions ; and most dramatically , I suppose , from the change in her features when we were talking to the so-called person she thinks is inside her . You see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed in this person . Do you follow ? " " I think I do , " Chris answered , squinting her eyes in puzzlement . " But one thing I do n't understand is where this person conies from . I mean , you keep hearing about split personality ' but I 've never really known any explanation . " " Well , neither does anyone else , Mrs. MacNeil . We use127concepts like ' consciousness '  --  ' mind '  --  ' personality , ' but we do n't really know yet what these things are . " He was shaking his head . " Not really . Not at all . So when I start talking about something like multiple or split personality , all we have are some theories that raise more questions than they give answers . Freud thought that certain ideas and feelings are somehowrepressed by the conscious mind , but remain alive in a person 's subconscious ; remain quite strong , in fact , and continue to seek expression through various psychiatric symptoms . Now when this repressed , or let 's call it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off from the mainstreamof consciousness  --  well , when this type of material is sufficiently strong , or where the subject 's personality is disorganizedand weak , the result can be schizophrenic psychosis . Now that is n't the same , " he cautioned , " as dual personality . Schizophrenia means a shattering of personality . But where the dissociated material is strong enough to somehow come glued together , to somehow organize in the individual 's subconscious  --  why , then it 's been known , at times , to function independently as a separate personality ; to take over the bodily functions . " He took a breath . Chris listened intently and he went on . " That 's one theory . There are several others , some of them involving the notion of escape into unawareness ; escape from some conflict or emotional problem . Getting back to Regan , she has n't any history of schizophrenia and the EEG did n't show up the brain-wave pattern that normally accompanies it . So I tend to reject schizophrenia . ' Which leaves us the general field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Chris murmured bleakly . The worried psychiatrist smiled thinly . " Hysteria , " he continued , " is a form of neurosis in which emotional disturbances are converted into bodily disorders . Now , in certain of its forms , there 's dissociation . In psychasthenia , for example , the individual loses consciousness of his actions , but he sees himselfact and attributes his actions to someone else . His idea of the second personality is vague , however , and Regan 's seems specific . So we come to what Freud used to call the ' conversion ' form of hysteria . It grows from unconscious feelings of guilt and the need to be punished . Dissociation is the paramount feature here , even multiple personality . And the syndrome might also include epileptoid-like convulsions ; hallucinations ; abnormal motor excitement . " " Gee , that does sound a lot like Regan , " Chris ventured moodily . " Do n't you think ? I mean , except for the guilt part . What would she have to feel guilty about ? " " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be the divorce . Children often feel they are the ones rejected and assume the full responsibility for the departure of one of their parents . In the case of your daughter , there 's reason to believe that that could be the case . Here I 'm thinking of the brooding and the deep depression over the notion of people dying : thanatophobia . In children , you 'll find it accompanied by guilt formation that 's related to family stress , very often fear of the loss of a parent . It produces rage and intense frustration . In addition , the guilt in this type of hysteria need n't be known to the conscious mind . It could even be the guilt that we call free-floating , ' a general guilt that relates to nothing in particular , " he concluded . Chris gave her head a shake . " I 'm confused , " she murmured . " I mean , where does this new personality come in ? " " Well , again , it 's a guess , " he replied , " just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from guilt , then the second personality is simply the agent who handles the punishing . If Regan herself were to do it , you see , that would mean she would recognize her guilt . But she wants to escape that recognition . Therefore , a second personality . " " And that 's what you think she 's got ? " " As I said , I do n't know , " replied the psychiatrist , still evasive . He seemed to be choosing his words as he would129128moss-covered stones to cross a stream . " It 's extremely unusual for a child of Regan 's age to be able to pull together and organize the components of a new personality . And certain  --  well , other things are puzzling . Her performance with the Ouija board , for example , would indicate extreme suggestibility ; and yet apparently I never really hypnotized her . " He shrugged . " Well , perhaps she resisted . But the really striking thing , " he noted , " is the new personality 's apparent precocity . It is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older . And then there 's the language she was speaking .... " He stared at the rug in front of the fireplace , thoughtfully tugging at his lower lip . " There 's a similar state , of course , but we do n't know much about it : a form of somnambulism where the subject suddenly manifests knowledge or skills that he 's never learned  --  and where the intention of the second personality is the destruction of the first . However ... " The word trailed away . Abruptly the psychiatrist looked up at Chris . " Well , it 's terribly complicated , " he told her , " and I 've oversimplified outrageously . " " So what 's the bottom line ? " Chris asked . " At the moment , " he told her , " a blank . She needs an intensiveexamination by a team of experts , two or three weeks of really concentrated study in a clinical atmosphere ; say , the Barringer Clinic in Dayton . " Chris looked away . " It 's a problem ? " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just lost Hope , that 's all . " " Did n't get you . " " It 's an inside tragedy . " The psychiatrist telephoned the Barringer Clinic from Chris 's study . They agreed to take Regan the following day . The doctors left . Chris swallowed pain with remembrance of Dennings , with remembrance of death and the worm and the void and un-130speakable loneliness and stillness , darkness , underneath the sod , with nothing moving , no , no motion . . . . Briefly , she wept . Too much . . . too much . . . Then she put it away and began to pack . She was standing in her bedroom selecting a camouflaging wig to wear in Dayton when Karl appeared . There was someone to see her , he told her . " Who ? " " Detective . " " And he wants to see me ? " He nodded . Then he handed her a business card . She looked it over blankly . WILLIAM F. KINDERMAN , it announced , LIEUTENANTOF DETECTIVES ; and tucked in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was printed in an ornate , raised Tudor typeface that might have been selected by a dealer in antiques . She looked up from the card with a sniffing suspicion . " Has he got something with him that might be a script ? Like a big manila envelope or something ? " There was no one in the world , Chris had come to discover , who did n't have a novel or a script or a notion for one or both tucked away in a drawer or a mental sock . She seemed to attractthem as priests did drunks . But Karl shook his head . Chris immediately grew curious and walked down the stairs . Burke ? Was it something to do with Burke ? He was sagging in the entry hall , the brim of his limp and crumpled hat clutched tight with short fat fingers freshly manicured . Plump . In his middle fifties . Jowly cheeks that gleamed of soap . Yet rumpled trousers , cuffed and baggy , mocked the sedulous care that he gave his body . A gray tweed coat hung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which dropped at the corners , seemed to be staring at times gone by . He wheezed asthmatically as he waited. 131Chris approached . The detective extended his hand with a weary and somewhat fatherly manner , and spoke in a hoarse , emphysematous whisper . " I 'd know that face in any lineup , Miss MacNeil . " " Am I in one ? " Chris asked him earnestly as she took his hand . " Oh , my goodness , oh , no , " he said , brushing at the notion with his hand as if swatting at a fly . He 'd closed his eyes and inclined his head ; the other hand rested lightly on his paunch . Chris was expecting a God forbid ! " No , it 's strictly routine , " he assured her , " routine . Look , you 're busy ? Tomorrow . I 'll come again tomorrow . " He was turning away as if to leave , but Chris said anxiously , " What is it ? Burke ? Burke Dennings ? " The detective 's drooping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " A shame . What a shame , " the detective breathed with lowered eyes and a shake of the head . " Was he killed ? " Chris asked with a look of shock . " I mean , is that why you 're here ? He was killed ? Is that it ? " " No , no , no , it 's routine , " he repeated , " routine . You know , a man so important , we just could n't pass it . We could n't , " he pleaded with a helpless look . " At least one or two questions . Did he fall ? Was he pushed ? " As he asked , he was listing from side to side with his head and his hand . Then he shrugged and huskily whispered , " Who knows ? " " Was he robbed ? " " No , not robbed , Miss MacNeil , never robbed , but then who needs a motive in times like these ? " His hands were constantly in motion , like a flabby glove informed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , today , for a murderer , Miss MacNeil , a motive is only an encumbrance ; in fact , a deterrent . " He shook his head . " These drugs , these drugs , " he bemoaned . " These drugs . This LSD. " 132He looked at Chris as he tapped his chest with the tips of his fingers . " Believe me , I 'm a father , and when I see what 's going on , it breaks my heart . You 've got children ? " " Yes , one . " " A son ? " " A daughter . " " Well ... " " Listen , come on in the study , " Chris interrupted anxiously , turning about to lead the way . She was losing all patience . " Miss MacNeil , could I trouble you for something ? " She turned with the dim and weary expectation that he wanted her autograph for his children . It was never for themselves . It was always for their children . " Yeah , sure , " she said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a grimace . " Do you keep any Calso water , maybe ? If it 's trouble , never mind ; I do n't want to be trouble . " " No , no trouble at all , " she sighed . " Grab a chair in the study . " She pointed , then turned and headed for the kitchen . " I think there 's a bottle in the fridge . " " No , I 'll come to the kitchen , " he told her , following . " I hate to be a bother . " " No bother . " " No , really , you 're busy , I 'll come . You 've got children ? " he asked as they walked . " No , that 's right ; yes , a daughter ; you told me ; that 's right . Just the one . " " Just the one . " " And how old ? " " She just turned twelve . " " Then you do n't have to worry , " he breathed . " No , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He was shaking his head . Chris noticed that his walk was a modified waddle . " When you see all the sickness day in and day out , " he continued . " Unbelievable . Incredible . Crazy . You know , I looked at my wife just a couple of days ago  --  or weeks ago  --  I forget . I said , 133Mary , the world  --  the entire world  --  is having a massive nervous breakdown . All . The whole world . " He gestured globally . They had entered the kitchen , where Karl was polishing the interior of the oven . He neither turned nor acknowledged their presence . " This is really so embarrassing , "  --  the detective wheezed hoarsely as Chris was opening the refrigerator door . Yet his gaze was on Karl , brushing swiftly and questioningly over his back and his arms and his neck like a small , dark bird skimming over a lake . " I meet a famous motion-picture star , " he continued , " and I ask for some Calso water . Ah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now was looking for an opener . " Ice ? " she asked . " No , plain ; plain is fine . " She was opening the bottle . " You know that film you made called Angel ? " he said . " I saw that film six times . " " If you were looking for the killer , " she murmured as she poured out the bubbling Calso , " arrest the producer and the cutter . " " Oh , no , no , it was excellent  --  really  --  I loved it ! " " Sit down . " She was nodding at the table . " Oh , thank you . " He sat . " No , the film was just lovely , " he insisted . " So touching . But just one thing , " he ventured , " one little tiny , minuscule point . Oh , thank you . " She 'd set down the glass of Calso and sat on the other side of the table , hands clasped before her . " One minor flaw , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe me , I 'm only a layman . You know ? I 'm just audience . What do I know ? However , it seemed to me  --  to a layman  --  that the musical score was getting in the way of certain scenes . It was too intrusive . " He was earnest now ; caught up . " It kept on reminding me that this was a movie . You know ? Like so many of these fancy camera angles lately. 134So distracting . Incidentally , the score , Miss MacNeil  --  did he steal that perhaps from Mendelssohn ? " Chris drummed her fingertips lightly on the table . Strange detective . And why was he constantly glancing to Karl ? " I would n't know , " she said , " but I 'm glad you liked the picture . Better drink that , " she told him , nodding to the Calso . " It tends to get flat . " " Yes , of course . I 'm so garrulous . You 're busy . Forgive me . " He lifted the glass as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finger arching demurely away from the others . " Ah , good , that 's good , " he exhaled , contented , as he put aside the glass , his eye falling lightly on Regan 's sculpture of the bird . It was now the centerpiece of the table , its beak floating mockingly and at length above the salt and pepper shakers . " Quaint . " He smiled . " Nice . " He looked up . " The artist ? " " My daughter , " Chris told him . " Very nice . " " Look , I hate to be  --  " " Yes , yes , I know , I 'm a nuisance . Well , look , just a question or two and we 're done . In fact , only one question and then I 'll be going . " He was glancing at his wristwatch as if he were anxious to get away to some appointment . " Since poor Mr. Dennings , " he labored breathily , " had completed his filming in this area , we wondered if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now other than yourself , of course , did he have any friends in this area ? " " Oh , he was here that night , " Chris told him . " Oh ? " His eyebrows sickled upward . " Near the time of the accident ? " " When did it happen ? " she asked him . " Seven-o-five , " he told her . " Yes , I think so . " " Well , that settles it , then . " He nodded , turning in his chair as if preparatory to rising . " He was drunk , he was leaving , he fell down the steps . Yes , that settles it . Definitely. 135Listen , though , just for the sake of the record , can you tell me approximately what time he left the house ? " He was pawing at truth like a weary bachelor pinching vege- tables at market . How did he ever make lieutenant ? Chris wondered . " I do n't know , " she replied . " I did n't see him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he came and left while I was out . I was over at a doctor 's office in Rosslyn . " " Ah , I see . " He nodded . " Of course . But then how do you know he was here ? " " Oh , well , Sharon said  --  " " Sharon ? " he interrupted . " Sharon Spencer . She 's my secretary . She was here when Burke dropped by . She  --  " " He came to see her ? " he asked . " No , me . " " Yes , of course . Yes , forgive me for interrupting . " " My daughter was sick and Sharon left him here while she went to pick up some prescriptions . By the time I got home , though , Burke was gone . " " And what time was that , please ? " " Seven-fifteen or so , seven-thirty . " " And what time had you left ? " " Maybe six-fifteenish . " " What time had Miss Spencer left ? " " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left and the time you returned , who was here in the house with Mr. Dennings be- sides your daughter ? " " No one . " " No one ? Ile left her alone ? " She nodded . " No servants ? " " No , Willie and Karl were  --  " " Who are they ? " 136 137Chris abruptly felt the earth shift under her feet . The nuzzling interview , she realized , was suddenly steely interrogation . " Well , Karl 's right there . " She motioned with her head , her glance fixed dully on the servant 's back . Still polishing the oven . . . " And Willie 's his wife , " she resumed . " They 're my housekeepers . " Polishing . . . " They 'd taken the afternoon off and when I got home , they were n't back yet . Willie . . . " Chris paused . " Willie what ? " " Oh , well , nothing . " She shrugged as she tugged her gaze away from the manservant 's brawny back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why was Karl still polishing ? She reached for a cigarette . Kinderman lit it . " So then only your daughter would know when Dennings left the house . " " It was really an accident ? " " Oh , of course . It 's routine , Miss MacNeil , it 's routine . Mr. Dennings was n't robbed and he had no enemies , none that we know of , that is , in the District . " Chris darted a momentary glance to Karl but then shifted it quickly back to Kinderman . Had he noticed ? Apparently not . He was fingering the sculpture . " It 's got a name , this kind of bird ; I ca n't think of it . Something . " Ile noticed Chris staring and looked vaguely embarrassed . " Forgive me , you 're busy . Well , a minute and we 're done . Now your daughter , she would know when Mr. Denningsleft ? " " No , she would n't . She was heavily sedated . " " Ah , dear me , a shame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's serious ? " " Yes , I 'm afraid it is . " " May I ask . . . ? " he probed with a delicate gesture . " We still do n't know . " " Watch out for drafts , " he cautioned firmly . Chris looked blank . " A draft in the winter when a house is hot is a magic carpet for bacteria . My mother used to say that . Maybe that 's folk myth . Maybe . " He shrugged . " But a myth , to speak plainly , to me is like a menu in a fancy French restaurant : glamorous , complicated camouflage for a fact you would n't otherwise swallow , like maybe lima beans , " he said earnestly . Chris relaxed . The shaggy dog padding fuddled through cornfields had returned . " That 's hers , that 's her room "  --  he was thumbing toward the ceiling  --  " with that great big window looking out on those steps ? " Chris nodded . " Keep the window closed and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always closed and it 's always shuttered , " Chris said as he dipped a pudgy hand in the inside pocket of his jacket . " She 'll get better , " he repeated sententiously . " Just remember , An ounce of prevention ... ' " Chris drummed her fingertips on the tabletop again . " You 're busy . Well , we 're finished . Just a note for the record  --  routine  --  we 're all done . " From the pocket of the jacket he 'd extracted a crumpled mimeographed program of a high-school production of Cyrano de Bergerac and now groped in the pockets of his coat , where he netted a toothmarked yellow stub of a number 2 pencil , whose point had the look of having been sharpened with the blade of a scissors . He pressed the program flat on the table , brushing out the wrinkles . " Now just a name or two , " he puffed . " That 's Spencer with a c ? " " Yes , c . " " A c , " he repeated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And the housekeepers ? John and Willie . . . ? " " Karl and Willie Engstrom . " " Karl . That 's right , it 's Karl . Karl Engstrom . " He scribbled the names in a dark , thick script . " Now the times I remem-138ber , " he told her huskily , turning the program around in search of white space . " Times I  --  Oh . Oh , no , wait . I forgot . Yes , the housekeepers . You said they got home at what time ? " " I did n't say . Karl , what time did you get in last night ? " Chris called to him . The Swiss turned around , his face inscrutable . " Exactly nine-thirty , madam . " " Yeah , that 's right , you 'd forgotten your key . I remember I looked at the clock in the kitchen when you rang the door-bell . " " You saw a good film ? " the detective asked Karl . " I never go by reviews , " he explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the people think , the audience . " " Paul Scofield in Lear , " Karl informed the detective . " All , I saw that ; that 's excellent . Excellent . Marvelous . " " Yes , at the Crest , " Karl continued . " The six-o'clock showing . Then immediately after I take the bus from in front ofthe theater and  --  " " Please , that 's not necessary , " the detective protested with a gesture . " Please . " " I do n't mind . " " If you insist . " " I get off at Wisconsin Avenue and M Street . Nine-twenty , perhaps . And then I walk to the house . " " Look , you did n't have to tell me , " the detective told him , " but anyway , thank you , it was very considerate . You liked the film ? " " It was excellent . " " Yes , I thought so too . Exceptional . Well , now . . . " He turned back to Chris and to scribbling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I have a job . " He shrugged . " Well , only a moment and finished . Tragic . . . tragic . . . " he breathed as he jotted down fragments in margins . " Such a talent . And a man who , knew people , I 'm sure : how to handle them . With so many elements who could make him look good or maybe139make him look bad  --  like the cameraman , the sound man , the composer , whatever . . . . Please correct me if I 'm wrong , but it seems to me nowadays a director of importance has also to be almost a Dale Carnegie . Am I wrong ? " " Oh , well , Burke had a temper , " Chris sighed . The detective repositioned the program . " All , well , maybe so with the big shots . People his size . " Once again he was scribbling . " But the kcy is the little people , the menials , the people who handle the minor details that if they did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you think ? " Chris glanced at her fingernails and ruefully shook her head . " When Burke let fly , he never discriminated , " she murmured with a weak , wry smile . " No , sir . It was only when he drank , though . " " Finished . We 're finished . " Kinderman was dotting a final i . " Oh , no , wait , " he abruptly remembered . " Mrs. Engstrom . They went and came together ? " Ile was gesturing toward Karl . " No , she went to see a Beatles film , " Chris answered just as Karl was turning to reply . " She got in a few minutes after I did . " " Why did I ask that ? It was n't important . " He shrugged as he folded up the program and tucked it away in the pocket of his jacket along with the pencil . " Well , that 's that . When I 'm back in the office , no doubt I 'll remember something I should have asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I could call you , " lie puffed , standing up . Chris rose along with him . " Well , I 'm going out of town for a couple of weeks , " she said . " It can wait , " he assured her . " It can wait . " He was staring at the sculpture with a smiling fondness . " Cute . So cute , " he said . He 'd leaned over and picked it up and was rubbing his thumb along its beak. 140Chris bent over to pick up a thread on the kitchen floor . " Have you got a good doctor ? " the detective asked her . " I mean for your daughter . " He replaced the figure and began to leave . Glumly Chris followed , winding the thread around her thumb . " Well , I 've sure got enough of them , " she murmured . " Anyway , I 'm checking her into a clinic that 's supposed to be great at doing what you do , only with viruses . " " Let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of town , this clinic ? " " Yes , it is . " " It 's a good one ? " " We 'll see . " " Keep her out of the draft . " They had reached the front door of the house . He put a hand on the doorknob . " Well , I would say that it 's been a pleasure , but under the circumstances . . . " He bowed his head and shook it . " I 'm sorry . Really . I 'm terribly sorry . " Chris folded her arms and looked down at the rug . She nodded briefly . Kinderman opened the door and stepped outside . As he turned to Chris , he was putting on his hat . " Well , good luck with your daughter . " " Thanks . " She smiled wanly . " Good luck with the world . " He nodded with a gentle warmth and sadness , then waddled away . Chris watched as he listed toward a waiting squad car parked near the corner in front of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hat as a shearing wind sprang sharp from the south . The hem of his coat flapped . Chris closed the door . When he 'd entered the passenger side of the squad car , Kinderman turned and looked back at the house . He thought he saw movement at Regan 's window , a quick , lithe figure flashing to the side and out of view . He was n't sure . He'd141seen it peripherally as he 'd turned . But he noted that the shutters were open . Odd . For a moment he waited . No one appeared . With a puzzled frown , the detective turned and opened the glove compartment , extracting a small brown envelopeand a penknife . Unclasping the smallest of the blades of the knife , he held his thumb inside the envelope and surgicallyscraped paint from Regan 's sculpture from under his thumbnail . When he had finished and was sealing the envelope , he nodded to the detective-sergeant behind the wheel . They pulled away . As they drove down Prospect Street , Kinderman pocketed the envelope . " Take it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the traffic building up ahead . " This is business , not pleasure . " He rubbed at his eyes with weary fingers . " Ah , what a life , " he sighed . " What a life . " Later that evening , while Dr. Klein was injecting Regan with fifty milligrams of Sparine to assure her tranquillity on the journey to Dayton , Lieutenant Kinderman stood brooding in his office , palms pressed flat atop his desk as he pored over fragments of baffling data . The narrow beam of an ancient desk lamp flared on a clutter of scattered reports . There was no other light . He believed that it helped him narrow the focus of concentration . Kinderman 's breathing labored heavy in the darkness as his glance flitted here , now there . Then he took a deep breath and shut his eyes . Mental Clearance Sale ! he instructed himself , as he did whenever he wished to tidy his brain for a fresh point of view : Absolutely Everything Must Go ! When he opened his eyes , he examined the pathologist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cord with fractured skull and neck , plus numerous contusions , lacerations and abrasions ; stretchingof the neck skin ; ecchymosis of the neck skin ; shearingof platysma , sternomastoid , splenius , trapezius and various smaller muscles of the neck , with fracture of the spine and of the vertebrae and shearing of both the anterior and posterior spinous ligaments .. . He looked out a window at the dark of the city . The Capitol dome light glowed . The Congress was working late . He shut his eyes again , recalling his conversation with the District pathologist at eleven-fifty-five on the night of Dennings ' death . " It could have happened in the fall ? " " No , it 's very unlikely . The sternomastoids and the trapezius muscles alone are enough to prevent it . Then you 've also got the various articulations of the cervical spine to be overcome as well as the Iigaments holding the bones together . " " Speaking plainly , however , is it possible ? " " Well , of course , he was drunk and these muscles were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initial impact were sufficiently powerful and  --  " " Falling maybe twenty or thirty feet before he hit ? " " Yes , that , and if immediately after impact his head got stuck in something ; in other words , if there were immediate interference with the normal rotation of the head and body as a unit , well maybe  --  I say just maybe  --  you could get this re-sult . " " Could another human being have done it ? " " Yes , but he 'd have to be an exceptionally powerful man . " Kinderman had checked Karl Engstrom 's story regarding his whereabouts at the time of Dennings ' death . The show times matched , as did the schedule that night of a D.C. Transit bus . Moreover , the driver of the bus that Karl had claimed he had boarded by the theater went off duty at Wisconsin and M , where Karl had stated he alighted at approximately twenty minutes after nine . A change of drivers had taken place , and the off-duty driver had logged the time of his arrival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's desk was a record of a felony charge against Engstrom on August 27 , 1963 , alleging he had stolen a quantity of narcotics over a period of months from the home of a doctor in Beverly Hills where he and Willie were then employed. ... born April 20 , 1921 , in Zurich , Switzerland . Married to Willie nee Braun September 7 , 1941 . Daughter , Elvira , born New York City , January 11 , 1943 , current address unknown . Defendant .. . The remainder the detective found baffling : The doctor , whose testimony was sine qua non for successfulprosecution , abruptly  --  and without any explanation  --  dropped the charges . Why had he done so ? The Engstroms were hired by Chris MacNeil only two months later , which meant that the doctor had given them a favorable reference . Why would he do so ? Engstrom had certainly pilfered the drugs , and yet a medical examination at the time of the charge had failed to yield the slightest sign that the man was an addict , or even a user @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the detective softly recited Lewis Carroll 's " Jabberwocky " : ' Twits brillig and the slithy toves ... ' " Another of his mind-clearing tricks . When he 'd finished reciting , lie opened his eyes and fixed his gaze on the Capitol rotunda , trying to keep his mind a blank . But as usual , he found the task impossible . Sighing , he glanced at the police psychologist 's report on the recent desecrations at Holy Trinity : " ... statue ... phallus . . . human excrement . . . Damien Karras , " he had underscored in red . He breathed in the silence and then reached for a scholarly work on witchcraft , turning to a page he had marked with a paper clip : 144Black Mass . . . a form of devil worship , the ritual , in the main , consisting of ( 1 ) exhortation ( the " sermon " ) to performanceof evil among the community , ( 2 ) coition with the demon ( reputedly painful , the demon 's penis invariably described as " icy cold " ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were largely sexual in nature . For example , communion Hosts of unusual size were prepared ( compounded of flour , feces , menstrual blood and pus ) , which then were slit and used as artificial vaginas with which the priests would ferociously copulatewhile raving that they were ravishing the Virgin Mother of God or that they were sodomizing Christ . In another instanceof such practice , a statue of Christ was inserted deep in a girl 's vagina while into her anus was inserted the Host , which the priest then crushed as he shouted blasphemies and sodomized the girl . Life-sized images of Christ and the Virgin Mary also played a frequent role in the ritual . The image of the Virgin , for example  --  usually painted to give her a dissolute , sluttish appearance  --  was equipped with breasts which the cultists sucked and also a vagina into which the penis might be inserted . The statues of Christ were equipped with a phallus for fellatio by both the men and the women , and also for insertion into the vagina of the women and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ image , a human figure was bound to a cross and made to function in place of the statue , and upon the discharge of his semen it was collected in a blasphemously consecrated chalice and used in the making of the communion host , which was destined to be consecrated on an altar covered with excrement . ThisKinderman flipped the pages to an underlined paragraph dealing with ritualistic murder . He read it slowly , nibbling at the pad of an index finger , and when he had finished he frowned at the page and shook his head . He lifted a brooding glance to the lamp . He flicked it out . He left his office and drove to the morgue . The young attendant at the desk was munching at a ham145and cheese sandwich on rye , and brushed the crumbs from a crossword puzzle as Kinderman approached him . " Dennings , " the detective whispered hoarsely . The attendant nodded , filling in a five-letter horizontal , then rose with his sandwich and moved down the hall . Kindermanfollowed him , hat in hand , followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refrigerated lockers , to the dreamless cabinet used for the filing of sightless eyes . They halted at locker 32 . The expressionless attendant slid it out . He bit at his sandwich , and a fragment of mayonnaisespeckledcrust fell lightly to the shroud . For a moment , Kinderman stared down ; then , slowly and gently , he pulled back the sheet to expose what he 'd seen and yet could not accept . Burke Dennings ' head was turned completely around , facing backward . Cupped in the warm , green hollow of the campus , Damien Karras jogged alone around an oval , loamy track in khaki shorts and a cotton T-shirt drenched with the cling of healing sweat . Up ahead , on a hillock , the lime-white dome of the astronomical observatory pulsed with the beat of his stride ; behind him , the medical school fell away with churned-up shards of earth and care . Since release from his duties , he came here daily , lapping the miles and chasing sleep . He had almost caught it ; almost eased the clutch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It held him gentler now . Twenty laps . . . Much gentler . More ! Two more ! Much gentler . . . Powerful leg muscles blooded and stinging , rippling with along and leonine grace , Karras thumped around a turn when he noticed someone sitting on a bench to the side where he 'd laid out his towel , sweater and pants : a middle-aged man in a floppy overcoat and pulpy , crushed felt hat . He seemed to be watching him . Was he ? Yes . . . head turning as Karras passed . The priest accelerated , digging at the final lap with pounding strides that jarred the earth , then he slowed to a panting , gulping walk as he passed the bench without a glance , both hands pressed light to his throbbing sides . The heave of his rock-muscled chest and shoulders stretched his T-shirt , distortingthe stenciled word PHILOSOPHERS inscribed across the front in once-black letters now faded to a hint by repeated washings . The man in the overcoat stood up and began to approach him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The priest turned around and nodded briefly , squinting into sunlight , waiting for Kinderman to reach him , then beckoned him along as once attain he began to move . " Do you mind ? I 'll cramp , " he panted . " Yes , of course , " the detective answered , nodding with a wincing lack of enthusiasm as lie tucked his hands into his pockets . The walk from the parking lot had tired him . " Have  --  have we met ? " asked the Jesuit . " No , Father . No , but they said that you looked like a boxer ; some priest at the residence hall ; I forget . " He was tugging out his wallet . " So bad with names . " " And yours ? " " William Kinderman , Father . " Ile flashed his identification . " Homicide . " " Really ? " Karras scanned the badge and identification card with a shining , boyish interest . Flushed and perspiring , his face had an eager look of innocence as he turned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hey , you know something , Father ? " Kinderman answered , 148inspecting the Jesuit 's rugged features . " It 's true , you do look like a boxer . Excuse me ; that scar , you know , there by your eye ? " He was pointing . " Like Brando , it looks like , in Waterfront , just exactly Marlon Brando . They gave him a scar "  --  he was illustrating , pulling at the corner of his eye  --  " that made his eye look a little bit closed , just a little , made him look a little dreamy all the time , always sad . Well , that 's you , " he said , pointing . " You 're Brando . People tell you that , Father ? " " No , they do n't . " " Ever box ? " " Oh , a little . " " You 're from here in the District ? " " New York . " " Golden Gloves . Am I right ? " " You just made captain . " Karras @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Walk a little slower , please . Emphysema . " The detective was gesturing at his throat . " Oh , I 'm sorry . " Karras slowed his pace . " Never mind . Do you smoke ? " " Yes , I do . " " You should n't . " " Well , now tell me the problem . " " Of course ; I 'm digressing . Incidentally , you 're busy ? " the detective inquired . " I 'm not interrupting ? " " Interrupting what ? " asked Karras , bemused . " Well , mental prayer , perhaps . " " You will make captain . " Karras smiled cryptically . " Pardon me , I missed something ? " Karras shook his head ; but the smile lingered . " I doubt that you ever miss a thing , " he remarked . His sidelong glance toward Kinderman was sly and warmly twinkling . Kinderman halted and mounted a massive and hopeless effort at looking befuddled , but glancing at the Jesuit 's crinklingeyes , he lowered his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . of course . . . a psychiatrist . ' Who am I kidding ? " He shrugged . " Look , it 's habit with me , Father . Forgive me . Schmaltz  --  that 's the Kinderman method : pure schmaltz . Well , I 'll stop and tell you straight what it 's all about . " " The desecrations , " Karras said , nodding . " So I wasted my schmaltz , " the detective said quietly . " Sorry . " " Never mind , Father ; that I deserved . Yes , the things in the church , " he confirmed . " Correct . Only maybe something else besides , something serious . " " Murder ? " " Yes . Kick me again , I enjoy it . " " Well , Homicide Division . " The Jesuit shrugged . " Never mind , never mind , Marlon Brando ; never mind . People tell you for a priest you 're a little bit smart-ass ? " " Mea culpa , " Karras murmured . Though he was smiling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's selfesteem . He had n't meant to . And now he felt glad of a chance to express a sincere perplexity . " I do n't get it , though , " he added , taking care that he wrinkled his brow . " What 's the con-nection ? " " Look , Father , could we keep this between us ? Confidential ? Like a matter of confession , so to speak ? " " Of course . " He was eyeing the detective earnestly . " What is it ? " " You know that director who was doing the film here , Father ? Burke Dennings ? " " Well , I 've seen him . " " You 've seen him . " The detective nodded . " You 're also familiar with how he died ? " " Well , the papers ... " Karras shrugged again . " That 's just part of it . " " Oh ? " " Only part of it . Part . Just a part . Listen , what do you know on the subject of witchcraft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; I 'm leading up to something . Now witchcraft , please  --  you 're familiar ? " " A little . " " From the witching end , not the hunting . " " Oh , I once did a paper on it . " Karras smiled . " The psychiatricend . " " Oh , really ? Wonderful ! Great ! That 's a bonus . A plus . You could help me a lot , a lot more than I thought . Listen , Father . Now witchcraft ... " He reached up and gripped at the Jesuit 's arm as they rounded a turn and approached the bench . " Now me , I 'm a layman and , plainly speaking , not well educated . Not formally . No . But I read . Look , I know what they say about self-made men , that they 're horrible examples of unskilled labor . But me , I 'll speak plainly , I 'm not ashamed . Not at all , I 'm  --  " Abruptly he arrested the flow , looked down and shook his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't stop the schmaltz . Look , forgive me ; you 're busy . " " Yes , I 'm praying . " The Jesuit 's soft delivery had been dry and expressionless . Kinderman halted for a moment and eyed him . " You 're serious ? No . " The detective faced forward again and they walked . " Look , I 'll come to the point : the desecrations . They remind you of anything to do with witchcraft ? " " Maybe . Some rituals used in Black Mass . " " A-plus . And now Dennings  --  you read how he died ? " " In a fall . " " Well , I 'll tell you , and  --  please  --  confidential ! " " Of course . " The detective looked suddenly pained as he realized that Karras had no intention of stopping at the bench " Do you mind ? " he asked wistfully . " What ? " 1 50 " Could we stop ? Maybe sit ? " " Oh , sure . " They began to move back toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , I 'm fine now . " " You 're sure ? " " I 'm fine . " " All right , all right , if you insist . " " You were saying ? " " In a second , please , just one second . " Kinderman settled his aching bulk on the bench with a sigh of content . " Ali , better , that 's better , " he said as the Jesuit picked up his towel and wiped his perspiring face . " Middle age . What a life . " " Burke Dennings ? " " Burke Dennings , Burke Dennings , Burke Dennings ... " The detective was nodding down at his shoes . Then he glanced up at Karras . The priest was wiping the back of his neck . " Burke Dennings , good Father , was , found at the bottom of that long flight of steps at exactly five minutes after seven with his head turned completely around and backward . " Peppery shouts drifted muffled from the baseball diamond where the varsity team held practice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It did n't happen in the fall ? " he said at last . " Sure , it 's possible . " Kinderman shrugged . " But ... " " Unlikely , " Karras brooded . " And so what conics to mind in the context of witchcraft ? " The Jesuit sat down slowly , looking pensive . " Well , " he said finally , " supposedly demons broke the necks of witches that way . At least , that 's the myth . " " A myth ? " " Oh , largely , " he said , turning to Kinderman . " Although people did die that way , I suppose : likely members of a coven who either defected or gave away secrets . That 's just a guess . But I know it was a trademark of demonic assassins . " 152Kinderman nodded . " Exactly . Exactly . I remembered the connection from a murder in London . That 's now . I mean , lately , just four or five years ago , Father . I remembered that I read it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it too , but I think it turned out to be some sort of hoax . Am I wrong ? " " No , that 's right , Father , absolutely right . But in this case , at least , you can see some connection , maybe , with that and the things in the church . Maybe somebody crazy , Father , maybe someone with a spite against the Church . Sonic unconsciousrebellion , perhaps ... " " Sick priest , " murmured Karras . " That it ? " " Listen , you 're the psychiatrist , Father ; you tell me . " " Well , of course , the desecrations are clearly pathological , " Karras said thoughtfully , slipping on his sweater . " And if Dennings was murdered  --  well , I 'd guess that the killer 's pathological too . " " And perhaps had some knowledge of witchcraft ? " " Could be . " " Could be , " the detective grunted . " So who fits the bill , also lives in the neighborhood , and also has access in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Karras said , reaching out moodily beside him to a pair of sun-bleached khaki pants . " Listen , Father , this is hard for you  --  please !  --  I understand . But for priests on the campus here , you 're the psychiatrist , Father , so  --  " " No , I 've had a change of assignment . " " Oh , really ? In the middle of the year ? " " That 's the Order . " Karras shrugged as be pulled on the pants . " Still , you 'd know who was sick at the time and who was n't , correct ? I mean , this kind of sickness . You 'd know that . " " No , not necessarily , Lieutenant . Not at all . It would only153be an accident , in fact , if I did . You see , I 'm not a psychoanalyst . All I do is counsel . Anyway , " he commented , buttoninghis trousers , " I really know of no one who fits the de-scription . " " Ah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you would n't tell . " " No , I probably would n't . " " Incidentally  --  and I mention it only in passing  --  this ethic is lately considered illegal . Not to bother you with trivia , but lately a psychiatrist in sunny California , no less , was put in jail for not telling the police what he knew about a patient . " " That a threat ? " " Do n't talk paranoid . I mention it in passing . " " I could always tell the judge it was a matter of confession , " said the Jesuit , grinning wryly as he stood to tuck his shirt in . " Plainly speaking , " he added . The detective glanced up at him , faintly gloomy . " Want to go into business , Father ? " he said . Then looked away dismally . " Father ' . . . what Father ' ? " he asked rhetorically . " You 're a Jew ; I could tell when I met you . " The Jesuit chuckled . " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But then he smiled , looking impishly pleased with himself . He turned with beamingeyes . " That reminds me . The entrance examination to be a policeman , Father ? When I took it , one question went something like : What are rabies and what would you do for them ? ' Know what some dumbhead put down for an answer ? Emis ? Rabies , ' he said , are Jew priests , and I would do anything that I could for them . ' Honest ! " He 'd raised up a hand as in oath . Karras laughed . " Come on , I 'll walk you to your car . Are you parked in the lot ? " The detective looked up at him , reluctant to move . " Then we 're finished ? " The priest put a foot on the bench , leaning over , an arm restingheavily on his knee . " Look , I 'm really not covering up , " he said . " Really . If I knew of a priest like the one you 're looking for , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was such a man without giving you his name . Then I guess I 'd report it to the Provincial . But I do n't know of anyone who ' even comes close . " " Ah , well , " the detective sighed . " I never thought it was a priest in the first place . Not really . " He nodded toward the parking lot . " Yes , I 'm over there . " They started walking . " What I really suspect , " the detective continued , " if I said it out loud you would call me a nut . I do n't know . I do n't know . " He was shaking his head . " All these clubs and these cults where they kill for no reason . It makes you start thinkingpeculiar things . To keep up with the times , these days , you have to be a little bit crazy . " Karras nodded . " What 's that thing on your shirt ? " the detective asked him , motioning his head toward the Jesuit 's chest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the detective clarified . " The writing . Philosophers . ' " " Oh , I taught a few courses one year , " said Karras , " at Woodstock Seminary in Maryland . I played on the lower-class baseball team . They were called the Philosophers . " " Ah , and the upper-class team ? " " Theologians . " Kinderman smiled and shook his head . " Theologians three , Philosophers two , " he mused . " Philosophers three , Theologians two . " " Of course . " " Of course . " " Strange things , " the detective brooded . " Strange . Listen , Father , " he began on a reticent tack . " Listen , doctor . . . . Am I crazy , or could there be maybe a witch coven here in the District right now ? Right today ? " " Oh , come on , " said Karras. 154 155 " Then there could . " " Did n't get that . " " Now I 'll be the doctor , " the detective announced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finger . " You did n't say no , but instead you were smart-ass again . That 's defensive , good Father , defensive . You 're afraid you 'll look gullible , maybe ; a superstitious priest in front of Kinderman the mastermind , the rationalist "  --  he was tapping the finger at his temple  --  " the genius beside you , here , the walking Age of Reason . Right ? Am I right ? " The Jesuit stared at him now with mounting surmise and respect . " Why , that 's very astute , " he remarked . " Well , all right , then , " Kinderman grunted . " So I 'll ask you again : could there maybe be witch covens here in the District ? " " Well , I really would n't know , " answered Karras thoughtfully , arms folded across his chest . " But in parts of Europe they say Black Mass . " " Today ? " " Today . " " You mean just like the old days , Father ? Look , I read about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statues and who knows whatever . Not meaning to disgust you , by the way , but they did all those things ? It 's for real ? " " I do n't know . " " Your opinion , then , Father Defensive . " The Jesuit chuckled . " All right , then ; I think it 's for real . Or at least I suspect so . But most of my reasoning 's based on pathology . Sure , Black Mass . But anyone doing those things is a very disturbed human being , and disturbed in a very special way . There 's a clinical name for that kind of disturbance , in fact ; it 's called satanism  --  means people who ca n't have any sexual pleasure unless it 's connected to a blasphemous action . Well , it 's not that uncommon , not even today , and Black Mass was just used as the justification . " 156 " Again , please forgive me , but the things with the statues of Jesus and Mary ? " " What about them ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think this might interest you as a policeman . " His scholarly interest aroused and stirring , Karras ' manner grew quietly animated . " The records of the Paris police still carry the case of a couple of monks from a nearby monastery  --  let 's see . . . " He scratched his head as he tried to recall . " Yes , the one at Crepy , I believe . Well , whatever . " He shrugged . " Close by . At any rate , the monks came into an inn and got rather belligerent about wanting a bed for three . Well , the third they were carrying : a life-size statue of the Blessed Mother . " " All , boy , that 's shocking , " breathed the detective . " Shock-ing . " " But true . And a fair indication that what you 've been readingis based on fact . " " Well , the sex , maybe so , maybe so . I can see . That 's a whole other story altogether . Never mind . But the ritual murdersnow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Using blood from the newborn babies ? " The detective was alluding to something else he had read in the book on witchcraft , describinghow the unfrocked priest at Black Mass would at times slit the wrist of a newborn infant so that the blood poured into a chalice and later was consecrated and consumed in the form of communion . " That 's just like the stories they used to tell about the Jews , " the detective continued . " How they stole Christian babies and drank their blood . Look , forgive me , but your people told all those stories . " " If we did , forgive me . " " You 're absolved , you 're absolved . " Something dark , something sad , passed across the priest 's eyes , like the shadow of pain briefly remembered . He quickly fixed his eyes on the path just ahead. 157 " Well , I really do n't know about ritual murder , " said Karras . " I do n't . But a midwife in Switzerland once confessed to the murder of thirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , well , maybe she was tortured , " he amended . " Who knows ? But she certainly told a convincing story . She said she 'd hide a long , thin needle up her sleeve , so that when she was deliver- ing the baby , she 'd slip out the needle and stick it through the crown of the baby 's head , and then hide the needle again . No marks , " he said , glancing at Kinderman . " The baby looked stillborn . You 've heard of the prejudice European Catholics used to have against midwives ? Well , that 's how it started . " " That 's frightening . " " This century has n't got the lock on insanity . Anyway  --  " " Wait a minute , wait now , forgive me . These stories  --  they were told by some people who were tortured , correct ? So they 're basically not so reliable . They signed the confessions and later , the machers , they filled in the blanks . I mean , then there was nothing like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' so to speak . Am I right ? Am I right ? " " Yes , you 're right , but then too , many of the confessions were voluntary . " " So who would volunteer such things ? " " Well , possibly people who were mentally disturbed . " " Aha ! Another reliable source ! " " Well , of course you 're quite right , Lieutenant . I 'm just playing devil 's advocate . But one thing that sometimes we tend to forget is that people psychotic enough to confess to such things might conceivably be psychotic enough to have done them . For example , the myths about werewolves . So , fine , they 're ridiculous : no one can turn himself into a wolf . But what if a man were so disturbed that he not only thought that he was a werewolf , but also acted like one ? " " Terrible . What is this  --  theory now , Father , or fact ? " " Well , there 's William Stumpf , for example . Or Peter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sixteenth century 158 who thought he was a werewolf . He murdered perhaps twenty or thirty young children . " " You mean , he confessed it ? " " Well , yes , but I think the confession was valid . " " How so ? " " When they caught him , he was eating the brains of his two young daughters-in-law . " From the practice field , crisp in the thin , clear April sunlight , came echoes of chatter and ball against bat . " C'm on , Mullins , let 's shag it , let 's go , get the lead out ! " They had come to the parking lot , priest and detective . They walked now in silence . When they came to the squad car , Kinderman absently reached out toward the handle of the door . For a moment he paused , then lifted a moody look to Karras . " So what am I looking for , Father ? " he asked him . " A madman , " said Damien Karras softly . " Perhaps someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then silently nodded . He turned to the priest . " Want a ride ? " he asked , opening the door of the squad car . " Oh , thanks , but it 's just a short walk . " " Never mind that ; enjoy ! " Kinderman gestured impatiently , motioning Karras to get into the car . " You can tell all your friends you went riding in a police car . " The Jesuit grinned and slipped into the back . " Very good , very good , " the detective breathed hoarsely , then squirmed in beside him and closed the door . " No walk is short , " he commented . " None . " With Karras guiding , they drove toward the modern Jesuit residence hall on Prospect Street , where the priest had taken new quarters . To remain in the cottage , he 'd felt , might encourage the men he had counseled to continue to seek his professional help . " You like movies , Father Karras ? " 159 " Very much . " " You saw Lear ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw it . I get passes . " " That 's nice . " " I  --  get passes for the very best shows . Mrs. K. , she gets tired , though ; never likes to go . " " That 's too bad . " " It 's too bad ; yes , I hate to go alone . You know , I love to talk film ; to discuss ; to critique . " He was staring out the win- dow , gaze averted to the side and away from the priest . Karras nodded silently , looking down at his large and very powerful hands . They were clasped between his legs . A mo- ment passed . Then Kinderman hesitantly turned with a wistful look . " Would you like to see a film with me sometime , Father ? It 's free .... I get passes , " he added quickly . The priest looked at him , grinning . " As Elwood P. Dowd used to say in Harvey , Lieutenant : When ? " " Oh , I 'll call you , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 'd come to the residence hall and parked . Karras put a hand on the door and clicked it open . " Please do . Look , I 'm sorry that I was n't much help . " " Never mind , you were help . " Kinderman waved limply . Karras was climbing out of the car . " In fact , for a Jew who 's trying to pass , you 're a very nice man . " Karras turned , closed the door and leaned into the window with a faint , warm smile . " Do people ever tell you you look like Paul Newman ? " " Always . And believe me , inside this body , Mr. Newman is struggling to get out . Too crowded . Inside , " he said , " is also Clark Gable . " Karras waved with a grin and started away . " Father , wait ! " Karras turned . The detective was squeezing out of the car . i6o " Listen , Father , I forgot , " he puffed , approaching . " Slipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirty writing on it ? The one that was found in the church ? " " You mean the altar card ? " " Whatever . It 's still around ? " " Yes , I 've got it in my room . I was checking the Latin . You want it ? " " Yes , maybe it shows something . Maybe . " " Just a second , I 'll get it . " While Kinderman waited outside by the squad car , the Jesuit went to his ground-floor room facing out on Prospect Street and found the card . He came outside again and gave it to Kinderman . " Maybe some fingerprints , " Kinderman wheezed as he looked it over . Then , " No , wait , you 've been handling it , " he seemed to realize quickly . " Good thinking . Before you , the Jewish Mr. Moto . " He was fumbling at the card 's clear plastic sheath . " Ah , no , wait , it comes out , it comes out , it comes out ! " Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 've been handling the inside as well , Kirk Douglas ? " Karras grinned ruefully , nodding his head . " Never mind , maybe still we could find something else . Incidentally , you studied this ? " " Yes , I did . " " Your conclusion ? " Karras shrugged . " Does n't look like the work of a prankster . At first , I thought maybe a student . But I doubt it . Whoever did that thing is pretty deeply disturbed . " " As you said . " " And the Latin . . . " Karras brooded . " It 's not just flawless , Lieutenant , it 's  --  well , it 's got a definite style that 's very individual . It 's as if whoever did it 's used to thinking in Latin . " " Do priests ? " " Oh , come on , now ! " " Just answer the question , please , Father Paranoia . " 161 " Well , yes ; at a point in their training , they do . At least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Woodstock Seminary , certain philosophy courses were taught in Latin . " " How so ? " " For precision of thought . It 's like law . " " Ah , I see . " Karras suddenly looked earnest ; grave . " Look , Lieutenant , can I tell you who I really think did it ? " The detective leaned closer . " No , who ? " " Dominicans . Go pick on them . " Karras smiled , waved good-bye and walked away . " I lied ! " the detective called after him sullenly . " You look like Sal Mineo ! " Kinderman watched as the priest gave another little wave and entered the residence hall , then he turned and got into the squad car . He wheezed , sitting motionless , staring at the floorboard . " He hums , he hums , that man , " he murmured . " Just like a tuning fork under the water . " For a moment longer he held the look ; and then turned and told the driver , " All right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They pulled away . Karras ' new room was simply furnished : a single bed , a comfortable chair , a desk and bookshelves built into the wall . On the desk was an early photo of his mother , and in silent rebuke on the wall by his bed hung a metal crucifix . The narrow room was world enough for him . He cared little for possessions ; only that those he had be clean . He showered , scrubbing briskly , then slipped on khaki pants and a T-shirt and ambled to dinner in the priests ' refectory , where he spotted pink-cheeked Dyer sitting alone at a table in a corner . He moved to join him . " Hi , Damien , " said Dyer . The young priest was wearing a faded Snoopy sweatshirt . Karras bowed his head as he stood by a chair and murmured162a rapid grace . Then he blessed himself , sat and greeted his friend . " How 's the loafer ? " asked Dyer as Karras spread a napkin on his lap . " Who 's a loafer ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " It 's the quality that counts , " said Karras . " What 's dinner ? " " Ca n't you smell it ? " " Oh , shit , is it dog day ? " Knackwurst and sauerkraut . " It 's the quantity that counts , " replied Dyer serenely . Karras shook his head and reached out for the aluminumpitcher of milk . " I would n't do that , " murmured Dyer without expression as he buttered a slice of whole wheat bread . " See the bubbles ? Saltpeter . " " I need it , " said Karras . As he tipped up his glass to fill it with milk , he could hear someone joining them at the table . " Well , I finally read that book , " said the newcomer brightly . Karras glanced up and felt aching dismay , felt the soft crushingweight , press of lead , press of bone , as he recognized the priest who had come to him recently for counseling , the one who could not make friends . " Oh , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He set down the pitcher as if it were the booklet for a broken novena . The young priest talked , and half an hour later , Dyer was table-hopping , spiking the refectory with laughter . Karras checked his watch . " Want to pick up a jacket ? " he asked the young priest . " We can go across the street and take a look at the sunset . " Soon they were leaning against a railing at the top of the steps down to M Street . End of day . The burnished rays of the setting sun flamed glory at the clouds of the western sky and shattered in rippling , crimson dapples on the darkening waters of the river . Once Karras met God in this sight . Long ago . Like a lover forsaken , he still kept the rendezvous. 163six " Sure a sight , " said the younger man . " Yes , it is , " agreed Karras . " I try to get out here every night . " The campus clock boomed out the hour . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showing that the paint from Regan 's sculpture matched a scraping of paint from the desecrated statue of the Virgin Mary . And at 8:47 , in a slum in the northeast section of the city , an impassive Karl Engstrom emerged from a rat-infested tenementhouse , walked three blocks south to a bus stop , waited alone for a minute , expressionless , then crumpled , sobbing , against a lamppost . Lieutenant Kindcruian , at the time , was at the movies . On Wednesday , May 11 , they were back in the house . They put Regan to bed , installed a lock on the shutters and stripped all the mirrors from her bedroom and bathroom. " ... fewer and fewer lucid moments , and now there 's a total blacking out of her consciousness during the fits , I 'm afraid . That 's new and would seem to eliminate genuine hysteria . In the meantime , a symptom or two in the area of what we call parapsychic phenomena have .... " Dr. Klein came by , and Chris attended with Sharon as he drilled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during her periods of coma . He inserted the nasogastric tubing . " First ... " Chris forced herself to watch and yet not see her daughter 's face ; to grip at the words that the doctor was saying and push away others she 'd heard at the clinic . They seeped through herconsciousness like fog through the branches of a willow tree . " Now you stated No religion ' here , Mrs. MacNeil . Is that right ? No religious education at all ? " " Oh , well , maybe just God . ' You know , general . Why ? " " Well , for one thing , the content of much of her raving  --  when it is n't that gibberish she 's been spouting  --  is religiously oriented . Now where do you think she might get that ? " " Well , give me a for instance . " " Oh , Jesus and Mary , sixty-nine , ' for ex  --  " Klein had guided the tubing into Regan 's stomach . " First you check to see if fluid 's gotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tube in order to clamp off the flow of Sustagen . " If it ... " ... syndrome of a type of disorder that you rarely ever see anymore , except among primitive cultures . We call it **25;13396;TOOLONG . Quite frankly , we do n't know much about it except that it starts with some conflict or guilt that eventually leads to the patient 's delusion that his body 's been invaded by an alien intelligence ; a spirit , if you will . In times gone by , when belief in the devil was fairly strong , the possessingentity was usually a demon . In relatively modern cases , however , it 's mostly the spirit of someone dead , often someonethe patient has known or seen and is able unconsciously to mimic , like the voice and the mannerisms , even the features of the face , at times . They ... " After the gloomy Dr. Klein had left the house , Chris phoned her agent in Beverly Hills and announced to him lifelessly that she would n't be directing the segment . Then she called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the phone with a mountingfeeling of desperation . Someone . She would have to have help from .. . " . . . Cases where it 's spirits of the dead are more easy to deal with ; you do n't find the rages in most of those cases , or the hyperactivity and motor excitement . However , in the other166main type of somnambuliform possession , the new personality'salways malevolent , always hostile toward the first . Its primary aim , in fact , is to damage , torture and sometimes even kill it . " A set of restraining straps was delivered to the house and Chris stood watching , wan and spent , while Karl affixed them to Regan 's bed and then to her wrists . Then as Chris moved a pillow in an effort to center it under Regan 's head , the Swiss straightened up and looked pityingly at the child 's ravaged face . " She is going to be well ? " he asked . A hint of some emotionhad tinged his words ; they were lightly italicized with concern . But Chris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'd picked up an object that had been tucked under Regan 's pillow . " Who put this crucifix here ? " she demanded . " The syndrome is only the manifestation of some conflict , of some guilt , so we try to get at it , find out what it is . Well , the best procedure in a case like this is hypnotherapy ; however , we ca n't seem to put her under . So then we took a shot at narcosynthesis  --  that 's a treatment that uses narcotics  --  but , frankly , that looks like another dead end . " " So what 's next ? " " Mostly time , I 'm afraid , mostly time . We 'll just have to keep trying and hope for a change . In the meantime , she 's going to have to be hospitalized for a ... " Chris found Sharon in the kitchen setting up her typewriter on the table . She had just brought it up from the basement playroom . Willie sliced carrots at the sink for a stew . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Shar ? " Chris asked with the strain of tension . " What do you mean ? " asked Sharon , fuddled . " You did n't ? " " Chris , I do n't even know what you 're talking about . Look , I told you . I told you on the plane , all I 've ever said to Rags is God made the world ' and maybe things about  --  " 167 " Fine , Sharon , fine , I believe you , but  --  " " Me , I do n't put it , " growled Willie defensively . " Somebody put it there , dammit ! " Chris erupted , then wheeled on Karl as he entered the kitchen and opened the refrigerator door . " Look , I 'll ask you again , " she gritted in a tone that verged on shrillness : " Did you put that crucifix under her pillow ? " " No , madam , " he answered levelly . He was folding ice cubes into a face towel . " No . No cross . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damn you ! One of you is lying ! " She was shrieking with a rage that stunned the room . " Now you tell me who put it there , who  --  " Abruptlyshe slumped to a chair and began to sob into trembling hands . " Oh , I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry , I do n't know what I 'm doing ! " she wept . " Oh , my God , I do n't know what I 'm doing ! " Willie and Karl watched silently as Sharon came up beside her and kneaded her neck with a comforting hand . " Hey , okay . It 's okay . " Chris wiped at her face with the back of a sleeve . " Yeah , I guess whoever did it "  --  she sniffled  --  " was only trying to help . " " Look , I 'm telling you again and you 'd better believe it , I 'm not about to put her in a goddam asylum ! " " It 's  --  " " I do n't care what you call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight ! " " Well , I 'm sorry . " " Yeah , sorry ! Christ ! Eighty-eight doctors and all you can tell me with all of your bullshit is ... " Chris smoked a cigarette , tamped it out nervously and went upstairs to look in on Regan . She opened the door . In the gloom of the bedroom , she made out a figure by Regan 's bedside , sitting in a straight-backed wooden chair . Karl . What was he doing ? she wondered. 168As Chris moved closer , he did not look up , but kept his gaze on the child 's face . He had his arm outstretched and was touching it . vVhat was in his hand ? As Chris reached the bed- side , she saw what it was : the improvised ice pack he had fashioned in the kitchen . Karl was cooling Regan 's forehead . Chris was touched , stood watching with surprise , and when Karl did not move or acknowledge her presence , she turned and quietly left the room . She went to the kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on an impulse she went to the study . Maybe . . . maybe .. . " ... an outside chance , since possession is loosely related to hysteria insofar as the origin of the syndrome is almost always autosuggestive . Your daughter must have known about posses- sion , believed in possession , and known about some of its symptoms , so that now her unconscious is producing the syn- drome . If that can be established , you might take a stab at a form of cure that 's autosuggestive . I think of it as shock treat- ment in these cases , though most other therapists would n't agree , I suppose . Oh , well  --  as I said , it 's a very outside chance , and since you 're opposed to your daughter being hospitalized , I 'll  --  " " Name it , for God 's sake ! What is it ? ! " " Have you ever heard of exorcism , Mrs. MacNeil ? " The books in the study were part of the furnishings and Chris was unfamiliar with them . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " . . . stylized ritual now out of date in which rabbis and priests tried to drive out the spirit . It 's only the Catholics who have n't discarded it yet , but they keep it pretty much in the closet as sort of an embarrassment , I think . But to someone who thinks that he 's really possessed , I would say that the ritual 's rather impressive . It used to work , in fact , although not for the reason they thought , of course ; it was purely the force of suggestion . The victim 's belief in possession helped169 cause it , or at least the appearance of the syndrome , and in just the same way his belief in the power of the exorcism can make it disappear . It 's  --  ah , you 're frowning . Well , perhaps I should tell you about the Australian aborigines . They 're con- vinccd that if some wizard thinks a death ray ' at them from a distance , why , they 're definitely going to die , you see . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie down and slowly die ! And the only thing that saves them , at times , is a similar form of suggestion : a counteracting ray ' by another wizard ! " " Are you telling inc to take her to a witch doctor ? " " Yes , I suppose that I 'm saying just that : as a desperate measure , perhaps to a priest . That 's a rather bizarre little piece of advice , I know , even dangerous , in fact , unless we can definitely ascertain whether Regan knew anything at all about possession , and particularly exorcism , before this all came on . Do you think she might have read it ? " " No , I do n't . " " Seen a curn is about it sometime ? Something on tole vision ? " " No . " " Read the gospels , perhaps ? The New Testament ? " " Why ? " " There are quite a few accounts of possession in them ; of exorcisms by Christ . The descriptions of the symptoms , in fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " " Look , it 's no good .

No Bible . No New Testament . Not aHold it ! Her eyes darted quickly back to a title on the bottom shelf . The volume on witchcraft that Mary Jo Perrin had sent her . Chris plucked it out from the shelf and turned to the table of contents , running her thumbnail down the . . . There ! 170 The title of a chapter pulsed like a heartthrob : " States of Possession . " Chris closed the book and her eyes at the same time , wondering , wondering ... . Maybe . . . just maybe .. . She opened her eyes and walked slowly to the kitchen . Sharon was typing . Chris held up the book . " Did you read this , Shar ? " Sharon kept typing , never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " This book on witchcraft . " " No . " " Did you put it in the study ? " " No . Never touched it . " " Where 's Willie ? " " At the market . " Chris nodded , considering . Then went back upstairs to Regan 's bedroom . She showed Karl the book . " Did you put this in the study , Karl ? On the bookshelf ? " " No , madam . " " Maybe Willie , " Chris murmured as she stared at the book . Soft thrills of surmise rippled through her . Were the doctors at Barringer Clinic right ? Was this it ? Had Regan plucked her disorder through autosuggestion from the pages of this book ? Would she find her symptoms listed here ? Something specific that Regan was doing ? Chris sat at the table , opened to the chapter on possession and began to search , to search , to read : Immediately derivative of the prevalent belief in demons was the phenomenon known as possession , a state in which many individuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and were being controlled by either a demon ( most common in the period under discussion ) or the spirit of someone dead . There is no period of history or quarter of the globe where this phenomenon hasnot been reported , and in fairly constant terms , and yet it is still to be adequately explained . Since Traugott Oesterreich'sdefinitive study , first published in 1921 , very little has been added to the body of knowledge , the advances of psychiatry notwithstanding . Not fully explained ? Chris frowned . She 'd had a different impression from the doctors . What is known is the following : that various people , at various times , have undergone massive transformations so complete that those around them feel they are dealing with another person . Not only the voice , the mannerisms , facial expressions and characteristic movements are altered , but the subject himself now thinks of himself as totally distinct from the original person and as having a name  --  whether human or demonic  --  and separate history of its own ... . The symptoms . Where were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Archipelago , where possession is even today an everyday , common occurrence , the possessing spirit of someone dead often causes the possessed to mimic its gestures , voice and mannerisms so strikingly , that relatives of the deceased will burst into tears . But aside from so-called quasi-possession  --  those cases that are ultimately reducible to fraud , paranoia and hysteria  --  the problem has always lain with interpreting the phenomena , the oldest interpretation being the spiritist , an impression that is likely to be strengthenedby the fact that the intruding personality may have accomplishments quite foreign to the first . In the demoniacal form of possession , for example , the " demon " may speak in languages unknown to the first personality , or . . . There ! Something ! Regan 's gibberish ! An attempt at a language ? She read on quickly. 172 173 ... or manifest various parapsychic phenomena , telekinesis for example : the movement of objects without application of material force . The rappings ? The flinging up and down on the bed ? ... In cases of possession by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a monk who , abruptly , while possessed , became a gifted and brilliant dancer although he had never , before his possession , had occasion to dance so much as a step . So impressive , at times , are these manifestations that Jung , the psychiatrist , after studying a case at first hand , could offer only partial explanation for what he was certain could " not have been fraud " .. . Worrisome . The tone of this was worrisome. ... and William James , the greatest psychologist that Americahas ever produced , resorted to positing " the plausibility of the spiritualist interpretation of the phenomenon " after closely studying the so-called " Watseka Wonder , " a teenagedgirl in Watseka , Illinois , who became indistinguishable in personality from a girl named Mary Roff who had died in a state insane asylum twelve years prior to the possession ... . Frowning , Chris did not hear the doorbell chime ; did not hear Sharon stop typing to rise and go answer it . The demoniacal form of possession is usually thought to have had its origin in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time of Christ . The ancientEgyptians as well as the earliest civilizations of the Tigris and the Euphrates believed that physical and spiritual disorders were caused by invasion of the body by demons . The following , for example , is the formula for exorcism against maladies of children in ancient Egypt : " Go hence , thou who comest in darkness , whose nose is turned backwards , whose face is upside down . Hast thou come to kiss this child ? I will not let thee . . . " " Chris ? " She kept reading , absorbed . " Shar , I 'm busy . " " There 's a homicide detective wants to see you . " " Oh , Christ , Sharon , tell him to  --  " She stopped . " No , no , hold it . " Chris frowned , still staring at the book . " No . Tell him to come in . Let him in . " Sound of walking . Sound of waiting . What am I waiting for ? Chris wondered . She sat on ex- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dream one can never remember . He came in with Sharon , his hat brim crumpled in his hand , wheezing and listing and deferential . " So sorry . You 're busy , you 're busy , I'nl a bother . " " How 's the world ? " " Very bad , very bad . How 's your daughter ? " " No change . " " Ah , I 'm sorry , I 'm terrible sorry . " He was hulking by the table now , his eyelids dripping concern . " Look , I would n't even bother ; your daughter ; it 's a worry . God knows , when my Ruthie was down with the  --  no no no no , it was Sheila , my little  --  " " Please sit down , " Chris cut in . " Oh , yes , thank you , " he exhaled , gratefully settling his bulk in a chair across the table from Sharon , who had now returned to her typing of letters . " I 'm sorry ; you were saying ? " Chris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she  --  ah , never mind . " He dismissed it . " You 're busy . I get started , I 'll tell my life story , you could maybe make a film of it . Really ! It 's incredible ! If you only knew half of the things used to happen in my crazy family , you know , like my  --  ah , well , you 're  --  One ! I 'll tell one ! Like 174 my mother , every Friday she made us gefilte fish , right ? Only all week long , the whole week , no one gets to take a bath on account of my mother has the carp in the bathtub , it 's swimmingback and forth , back and forth , the whole week , because my mother said this cleaned out the poison in its system ! You 're prepared ? Because it . . . Ah , that 's enough now ; enough . " He sighed wearily , motioning his hand in a gesture of dismissal . " But now and then a laugh just to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting ... . " Ah , you 're reading . " He was glancing at the book on witchcraft . " For a film ? " he inquired . " Just reading . " " It 's good ? " " I just started . " " Witchcraft , " he murmured , his head angled , reading the title at the top of the'pages . " What 's doin ' ? " Chris asked him . " Yes , I 'm sorry . You 're busy . You 're busy . I 'll finish . As I said , I would n't bother you , except ... " " Except what ? " He looked suddenly grave and clasped his hands on the table . " Well , Mr. Dennings , Mrs. MacNeil ... " " Well ... " " Darn it , " snapped Sharon with irritation as she ripped out a letter from the platen of the typewriter . She balled it up and tossed it at a wastepaper basket near Kinderman . " Oh , I 'm sorry , " she apologized as she saw that her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 're Miss Fenster ? " Kinderman asked her . " Spencer , " said Sharon , pulling back her chair in order to rise and retrieve the letter . " Never mind , never mind , " said Kinderman as he reached to the floor near his foot and picked up the crumpled page . " Thanks , " said Sharon . " Nothing . Excuse me  --  you 're the secretary ? " " Sharon , this is ... " " Kinderman , " the detective reminded her . " William Kinder-man . " " Right . This is Sharon Spencer . " " A pleasure , " Kinderman told the blonde , who now folded her arms on the typewriter , eyeing him curiously . " Perhaps you can help , " he added . " On the night of Mr. Dennings ' demise , you went out to a drugstore and left him alone in the house , correct ? " " Well , no ; Regan was here . " " That 's my daughter , " Chris clarified . Kindcrman continued to question Sharon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , that 's right . " " Ile expected her shortly ? " " Well , I told him I expected her back pretty soon . " " Very good . And you left at what time ? You remember ? " " Let 's see . I was watching the news , so I guess  --  oh , no , wait  --  yes , that 's right . I remember being bothered because the pharmacist said the delivery boy had gone home . I remember I said , Oh , come on , now , ' or something about its only being six-thirty . Then Burke came along just ten , maybe twenty minutes after that . " " So a median , " concluded the detective , " would have put him here at six-forty-five . " " And so what 's this all about ? " asked Chris , the nebulous tension in her mounting . " Well , it raises a question , Mrs. MacNeil , " wheezed Kinderman , turning his head to gaze at her . " To arrive in the house at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... " " Oh , well , that was Burke , " said Chris . " Just like him . " " Was it also like Mr. Dennings , " asked Kinderman , " to frequent the bars on M Street ? " 176 " No . " " No , I thought not . I made a little check . And was it also not his custom to travel by taxi ? He would n't call a cab from the house when he left ? " " Yes , he would . " " Then one wonders  --  not so ?  --  how he came to be walking on the platform at the top of the steps . And one wonders why taxicab companies do not show a record of calls from this house on that night , " added Kinderman , " except for the one that picked up your Miss Spencer here at precisely six-forty-seven . " " I do n't know , " answered Chris , her voice drained of color ... and waiting . . " You knew all along ! " gasped Sharon at Kinderman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the detective told her . " However , the matter has now grown serious . " Chris breathed shallowly , fixing the detective with a steady gaze . " In what way ? " she asked . Her voice came thin from her throat . He leaned over hands still clasped on the table , the page of typescript balled between them . " The report of the pathologist , Mrs. MacNeil , seems to show that the chance that he died accidentally is still very possible . However ... " " Are you saying he was murdered ? " Chris tensed . " The position  --  now I know this is painful  --  " " Go ahead . " " The position of Dennings ' head and a certain shearing of the muscles of the neck would  --  " " Oh , God ! " Chris winced . " Yes , it 's painful . I 'm sorry ; I 'm terribly sorry . But you see , this condition  --  we can skip the details  --  but it never could happen , you see , unless Mr. Dennings had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some twenty or177thirty feet before he went rolling down to the bottom . So a clear possibility , plainly speaking , is maybe . . . Well , first let me ask you . . . " He 'd turned now to a frowning Sharon . " When you left , he was where , Mr. Dennings ? With the child ? " " No , down here in the study . He was fixing a drink . " " Might your daughter remember "  --  he turned to Chris  --  " if perhaps Mr. Dennings was in her room that night ? " Has she ever been alone with him ? " Why do you ask ? " " Might your daughter remember ? " " No , I told you before , she was heavily sedated and  --  " " Yes , yes , you told me ; that 's true ; I recall it ; but perhaps she awakened  --  not so ?  --  and . . . " " No chance . And  --  " " She was also sedated , " he interrupted , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yes ; as a matter of fact she was , " Chris recalled . " So what ? " " I thought I saw her at her window that day . " " You 're mistaken . " He shrugged . " It could be , it could be ; I 'm not sure . " " Listen , why are you asking all this ? " Chris demanded . " Well , a clear possibility , as I was saying , is maybe the de- ceased was so drunk that he stumbled and fell from the window in your daughter 's bedroom . " Chris shook her head . " No way . No chance . In the first place , the window was always closed , and in the second place , Burke was always drunk , but he never got sloppy , never sloppy at all . That right , Shar ? " " Right . " " Burke used to direct when he was smashed . Now how could he stumble and fall out a window ? " " Were you maybe expecting someone else here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No . " " Have you friends who drop by without calling ? " " Just Burke , " Chris answered . " Why ? " The detective lowered his head and shook it , frowning at the crumpled paper in his hands . " Strange . . . so baffling . " He exhaled wearily . " Baffling . " Then he lifted his glance to Chris . " The deceased comes to visit , stays only twenty minutes without even seeing you , and leaves all alone here a very sick girl . And speaking plainly , Mrs. MacNeil , as you say , it 's not likely he would fall from a window . Besides that , a fall would n't do to his neck what we found except maybe a chance in a thousand . " He nodded with his head at the book on witchcraft . " You 've read in that book about ritual murder ? " Some prescience chilling her , Chris shook her head . " Maybe not in that book , " he said . " However  --  forgive me ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little bit harder  --  poor Mr. Dennings was discovered with his neck wrenched around in the style of ritual murder by so-called demons , Mrs. MacNeil . " Chris went white . " Some lunatic killed Mr. Dennings , " the detective continued , eyeing Chris fixedly . " At first , I never told you to spare you the hurt . And besides , it could technically still be an accident . But me , I do n't think so . My hunch . My opinion . I believe he was killed by a powerful man : point one . And the fracturing of his skull  --  point two  --  plus the various things I have mentioned , would make it very probable  --  probable , not certain  --  the deceased was killed and then afterward pushed from your daughter 's window . But no one was here except your daughter . So how could this be ? It could be one way : if someone came calling between the time Miss Spencer left and the time you returned . Not so ? Maybe so . Now I ask you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Judas priest , just a second ! " Chris whispered hoarsely , still in shock.
