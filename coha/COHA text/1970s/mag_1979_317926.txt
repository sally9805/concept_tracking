A Letter from the Chairman <P> In 56 years , only two men have served Time Inc. as editor in chief . The first , Henry R. Luce , founded this company . His successor , Hedley Donovan , gave it a second generation of editorial growth . On June 1 , he retired from the company . <P> Donovan came to Time Inc. with a magna cum laude degree from the University of Minnesota plus an Oxford degree acquired as a Rhodes scholar . He put in five years as a newspaperman in Washington , then most of World War II in the U.S. Navy . A 1945 personnel memo details these and other qualifications , going on to note that " young Donovan is a handsome gentleman of 31 , with blue eyes , a level gaze , a deep voice and a serious manner enlivened by a quick smile . " None of that description needs to be changed today , except , inevitably and unbelievably , 31 has become 65 . <P> Beginning as a writer on FORTUNE in December 1945 , Donovan moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Hedley Donovan 1959 he was appointed editorial director of Time Inc. and in 1964 editor in chief . <P> Since then , his guidance and governance have been reflected in each of our magazines , in Time-Life Books and in the Washington Star as well . He helped transform Time Inc. from the largely personal domain of its brilliant founder into a publicly held , diverse company , while preserving , we feel , its essential spirit and broadening its range . With great strength of character and a formidable intellect , he guided our publications through the bitterly divisive years of Viet Nam and Watergate , reaffirming or changing editorial policy . <P> It was under Donovan 's leadership that Time Inc. , in a remarkable six-year burst of creative activity , gave birth to two new magazines , MONEY and PEOPLE , rebirth to LIFE , and turned FORTUNE from a monthly into a fortnightly . <P> Time Inc. has a long tradition of separating editorial responsibilities and business management . The editor in chief reports not to the chairman or president of this company but to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supervision . Hedley Donovan 's immense authority - sometimes delegated , never diluted-has kept that tradition inviolate . But , while it was unthinkable to poach on his editorial territory , his own profound judgment in noneditorial matters was often called upon . <P> Succeeding Donovan as Time Inc. ' s editor in chief is Henry Grunwald , Viennese-born and TIME-nurtured . Grunwald began working for The Weekly Newsmagazine as a copy boy in 1944 , while still an undergraduate at New York University . The following year he became a writer , advanced to senior editor - the youngest ever-at age 28 and to managing editor in 1968 . After a nine-year tenure , during which the magazine changed considerably , he was appointed one of two corporate editors . <P> The other corporate editor was Ralph Graves , who now becomes Time Inc. ' s editorial director , in street , deputy to Grunwald . Graves , who joined us immediately after graduating from Harvard in 1948 , was managing editor of LIFE between 1969 and 1972 , and held other important editorial as well as publishing positions .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
