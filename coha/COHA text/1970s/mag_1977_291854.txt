In the pin-stripe halls of the Federal Reserve Building , appropriately located on Constitution Avenue and just a shadow 's length from the Lincoln Memorial , the phones jangled incessantly last Wednesday evening . Aides to Chairman Arthur Burns listened , amazed and amused . <P> Arthur was going to make it - he would be reappointed next day by Jimmy Carter , whispered the first caller . Ring , ring . Another voice . Sorry , it was all off . The President was dropping Burns as chairman . The negative word from the White House would soon be public . Jangle , jangle . New rumor running through the city . In just a few minutes Carter would speak in the Mayflower Hotel to the Business Council , a group of high-powered corporate chiefs , and drop his bombshell : Burns would have another four-year term as Fed chairman . Carter indeed met with the council , but he never mentioned Burns . <P> It is a commentary on our times that Arthur Burns , the conservative , grandfatherly economist of 73 , has be come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an interview . He twinkles , touches another match to one of his hundred or so pipes , and declines . International bankers claim , perhaps extravagantly , that his reappointment is needed to steady the stumbling dollar . American businessmen have raised him to near sainthood , even those who do not necessarily agree with all of Burns ' tactics but want him to stay . Housewives , engineers and preachers write Burns that the nation needs him . He has become a soft-voiced beguiling problem for Carter . <P> Burns reads his Bible every night ( about the same time that Jimmy Carter does ) and he plots his genial strategy of survival . He wants another term as Fed chairman , and not because he likes to go to capital par ties and enjoys the aroma of power ( which he does ) . But he thinks he is doing right by the nation to restrain the money sup ply , to preach a little caution , to stand immune from White House blandishments and politics . Burns views his ideas as good for the country 's soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Check and Balance , " says New York 's ad miring Republican Congressman Barber Conable , suggesting further that this country has developed a sound understanding and appreciation of the counterforces needed within the Government to constrain careless or inexperienced power . " Arthur is a great politician , " adds Conable . " He is a master of the pregnant pause . He knows when to clean his pipe . He can answer the most complicated questions with ' I doubt it , ' and the world is thunderstruck with his wisdom . When he comes to testify before any committee , the whole committee shows up . He has the same effect on the members that Henry Kissinger had . He seems to be right . "
