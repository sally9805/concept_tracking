Can the government of a Christian country survive the defiant opposition of its churches ? Rhodesia is about to find out . The churches have never condoned Prime Minister Ian Smith 's white supremacist policies . Now , on the eve of a critical general election on April 10 , the Roman Catholic Church has directly challenged them . <P> In a pastoral letter entitled A Crisis of Conscience , Salisbury 's Archbishop Francis Markall announced that the Catholic Church would refuse to obey Rhodesia 's race laws because they are " contrary to the Christian faith . " The letter , read at church services throughout the land , quotes the Apostles : " We must obey God rather than men . " <P> The main issue is a controversial land tenure act , part of Rhodesia 's newly adopted constitution , that assigns separate living areas for Africans and whites . Under the act , churches must register as " voluntary associations " in each area and obtain government permits for their activities . The Roman Catholic Church refuses to register because to do so would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of race . <P> Real Terrorists . People may be forbidden to worship in churches of their faith or educate their children outside their own prescribed racial areas , the pastoral letter warns . It adds : " We may be forced to refuse hospital beds to anyone not of the race approved in that area . Priests and nuns may have to be segregated in their communities according to their racial origins . The whole future of the church in Rhodesia is thus at stake . " The stakes are high . The Catholic Church , with 450,000 members , is the second largest denomination in Rhodesia . It runs 34 hospitals and 1,000 elementary schools . <P> Catholic rumblings against the Smith regime have been heard for at least two years , but only recently has discontent broken through . Last month Bishop Donal Lament of Umtali , head of the Catholic bishops ' conference , openly branded those responsible for the race laws " the real terrorists of Rhodesia .

He was chiefly responsible for the pastoral letter , signed by all four Roman Catholic bishops in Rhodesia . <P> The controversy has become an issue in the elections , with unforeseeable consequences . Smith is doing his best to prevent , or at least postpone a showdown between church and state . He has promised to face the problem raised by the Catholic hierarchy " in the cool , calm atmosphere of the post-election period " - when he hopes to have a new five-year mandate to do as he pleases . <P> From Rome , Pope Paul VI lent powerful support to his bishops . During his pre-Easter audience , the Pope singled out such " ignoble leftovers from the past " as racist intransigence and discrimination . Most other churches are expected to follow the lead of the Catholics . The Anglican bishop of Salisbury has praised the Catholics ' courage , and the African head of the Methodist church , Andrew Ndhela , came out in unqualified support . He is chairman of the Christian Council of Rhodesia , whose 16 denominations plan to meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
