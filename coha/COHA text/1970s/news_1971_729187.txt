txt With a month to go before its major military program stops for lack of money , the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation is reported to have reached an impasse in negotiations with the Pentagon to save the company from bankruptcy . " Somebody is going to have to back down , " said one individual who is familiar with the negotiations . The two sides have been trying to settle a $758-million dispute over costs on the $4.58-billion fleet of C-5A jumbo jet transports that Lockheed is building . The C-5A dispute is the core problem ? in about $1-billion in contract disagreements between the Defense Department and Lockheed , the nation 's leading military manufacturer . Government funds to produce the plane will cease by March 1 unless an agreement is reached . Disputed by Company Aide David Packard , Deputy Secretary of Defense , said last month that a halt in funds for the C-5A would plunge Lockheed into bankruptcy . William R. Wilson , Lockheed 's vice president for public relations , denied in a telephone conversation today that an impasse had occurred . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " As long as the parties are still talking , I do n't think you can call it a deadlock . " Other individuals familiar with the talks said , however , that meaningful negotiations between Lockheed and the Air Force had ceased and that Mr. Packard bad been informed that Lockheed was unwilling to agree to a settlement along guidelines he had laid down , Mr. Wilson also maintained today that a halt in Government funding for C-5A production would not necessarily force Lockheed into bankruptcy . " We 'll stop the program , " he said . " If we stop the program , we do n't have expenditures , we do n't have a financial drain , then we do n't go bankrupt . " " You 'll have something like 51 airplanes worth more than a billion dollars in a various state of disarray that are worthless , " he said . The Air Force has ordered 81 ** in all from Lockheed , and Mr. Wilson was apparently speaking of the 51 planes that would be finished or partly completed when the Government funds run out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stennis , chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee , Mr. Packard said he was offering Lockheed two alternatives for settlement . Under one , the Government would fund all the $758-million in disputed costs for the C-5A . Lockheed would later pay back $200-million of these costs as a fixed loss on the contract , with the Government absorbing the remaining $558-million . Under the other , the Government would initially pay all the $758-million and the courts would get the dispute over how a so-called repricing formula in the contract affects what the Government should pay for the planes . Mr. Packard said he wanted the court litigation confined to this point and estimated that Lockheed could eventually come out somewhere between a $25-million profit and a $480-million loss . Opposes Counteroffer At a Washington news conference a week later , Daniel J. Naughton , the Lockheed board chairman , in effect rejected both of Mr. Packard 's alternatives . He made a counteroffer that would have the Government pay all the costs of the C-5A while the dispute went to the courts for settlement of the repricing formula @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said privately that Mr. Packard found this counteroffer unacceptable because it would amount to the Government 's keeping Lockheed in business with publi " money while the corporation fought the dispute through the courts for years in open-ended litigation . He was said to feel that this solution would also be rejected by Congress . The negotiations between the Air Force and Lockheed since Mr. Haughton 's news conference were designed to see if Lockheed would narrow the issues to be litigated to a number acceptable to Mr. Packard . Individuals familiar with the talks , said that Lockheed had continued to decline to do so and had insisted on litigating so many issues that the corporation would have an open-ended position in the courts . Senator William Proxmire , Democrat of Wisconsin , who has vigorously and so far unsuccessfully opposed a financial rescue of Lockheed , charged in a Senate speech today , " The Pentagon and the Lockheed Corporation are wheeling and dealing with the taxpayers ' money . " He demanded that the dispute be sent to the court ' with no more funds advanced to Lockheed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporation . Fears ' Chain Reaction ' Mr. Wilson also denied today that Mr. Haughton , a 59-yearold aircraft industry leader of the World War II generation with a reputation for toughness , , was engaging in brinkmanship bargaining to force the Pentagon into a settlement on the corporation 's terms before Lockheed goes bankrupt , as some observers within and outside the Government have con- , tended . Mr. Packard said in his letter that a Lockheed bankruptcy ' was unacceptable because it ' , could set off a " chain reaction " that would imperil other defense manufacturers as well .. The commercial banks and the airlines have loaned Lockheed. about $450-million that would , likewise be imperiled by a collapse of the corporation . Observers have therefore contended that Mr. Haughton , aware of these possible reper- , cussions , is seeking to convert his weakness ' into strength in what is becoming a showdown between himself and Mr. Packard . " We 're not bluffing , " Mr. Wilson said today . " We 're just going ahead and doing what we think is a good thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Mr. Haughton was sitting on dissidents within his own organization who wanted to settle on Mr. Packard 's terms . " Categorically not true , " Mr. Wilson said of this report .
