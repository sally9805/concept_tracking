of habit  --  not to give anything , not even a reminiscence , to the slimespawn who want to pluck them of their treasure . " " And their hopes , " Adzel said low . " Do you think they can get a fair compensation ? " " From whichever government makes its claim stick , the Commonwealthor Babur ? Ho , ho , ho . Commonwealth control means control by corporations out for nothing but a bonanza , and by politicians and bureaucrats who hate the Supermetals Company because it never truckled to them . Baburite possession means  --  who knows ? Except that I ca n't imagine Babur giving two toots on a flute for the rights of a few oxygen breathers . " " Do you seriously believe Babur might get Mirkheim ? The basis of its claim , the sphere of interest ' principle , sounds preposterous .

It smelled of tea and of the Wodenite 's warm , slightly acrid body odor . " You do understand why van Rijn is sending us there , do n't you ? Mainly for information  --  any information whatever , so he can plan what to do . Right now , everything is a-rattle . The Commonwealth government is blundering blind the same as everyone else , not knowing what to expect of creaturesas alien as the Baburites . But also , if we possibly can , we should try to make , or at least suggest , a bargain . They 're in a position to harm quite a chunk of Solar Spice &; Liquors ' holdings , its trade ; and they do have a grudge against us in particular . " " Why ? " " You do n't know ? Well , about thirty years back , they tried to muscle in on a business that Solar had in a stuff called bluejack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was more lucrative than for us . Still , our factor there did n't see why we should tamely accept what amounted to straight robbery . He euchred them out of their gains by a clever trick , and made sure they could get no benefit from returning . That was the first agressive move Babur made in space . They seem to think they 're ready for the real action now . And cosmosknows the Commonwealth is ill-prepared . " " And so we fare forth again , we three and our ship , like our young days come back , " Adzel sighed , " except that this time our mission is not into the hopeful yonder . "  |p31Still  below the horizon , Maia , sun of Hermes , made the tops of steeples and towers in Starfall shine as if gilded . When it rose out of Daybreak Bay , its light struck westward over the Palomino River and straight along Olympic Avenue to Pilgrim Hill . There the brightness lost itself among trees , gardens , and buildings , the gray stone mass of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the New Keep , the austere erectness of Signal Station . A beam went past an upper balcony on the New Keep , through the French doors beyond , and across the bed of Sandra Tamarin-Asmundsen . She woke from dreams . " Pete , darling , " she whispered , reaching for him . Her eyes opened and she remembered she was alone . For an instant , emptiness possessed her . But the accident that claimed Peter Asmundsen ( big , boisterous , strong but fundamentally gentle man ) lay more than four years in the past . Time had eased pain , time and the work of being Grand Duchess , head of a planet whereon dwelt fifty million willful people . She sat up and made herself take pleasure in cool air and soft light . As usual , her alarm was not quite ready for her . She turned it off , rose , and strode out onto the balcony . A breeze from the dew and flowerbeds below caressed her bare skin . Nobody else seemed to be about , though her vision swept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bay and the Auroral Ocean beyond . A nidifex flew past , flutter of colorful wings and trill of song . After a minute Sandra went back inside , switched her phone to televisionreception , and commenced her daily half hour of exercises . She had more faith in them than in antisenescence , though in her mid-fifties she was duly taking those treatments . Her big body had changed little since youth . On the broad , high-cheekboned face were not many wrinkles , those mostly crow 's feet around the dark-browed green eyes . But her blond hair had gone silvery . Automatically moving , she escaped boredom by holding her attention on an early newscast . The Mirkheim crisis came first . " Rumors were widespread that Babur has issued a new declaration , a copy of which has reached Hermes . Spokesmen for the thronep32would neither confirm nor deny this , but promised a public statement soon . " The basis of the rumor was the landing at Williams Field yesterdayof a navy speedster known to have been stationed at Valya . I 'll just give review to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anglic-language pronunciamentos to the primitive planet Valya , by a ship which has gone into orbit and radioed the message to the scientific outpost there , with a request that the content be distributedas widely as possible . So several governments , including ours , are keeping boats on the scene , and by agreement are n't allowingnews services to do likewise . ' T is the closest thing to contact that anybody has with that nonhuman race , and officials say they fear possible bad results of premature disclosures . " The rumors were true , though the reality was n't worth overmuch excitement . " The Autarchy of United Babur , " whatever that meant , had simply reiterated its claim . Because Mirkheim was located so near , as interstellar distances went , and because the supermetals were of incalculable strategic importance , Babur could not and would not tolerate possession of that globe by any power which had demonstratedhostility to Babur 's legitimate activity in space . The sole noveltywas that this time these powers were bluntly identified , the Solar Commonwealth and the Polesotechnic League . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publication of the note until a committeeof xenologists could have examined it for new implications . She doubted they 'd find any . " Yesterday also we received a tape of an address by Prime MinisterLapierre of the Solar Commonwealth at a convention of the JusticeParty . He maintained that his government is willing to negotiate , but that Babur thus far has made none of the normal preliminary moves , such as arranging for exchange of ambassadors . At the same time , he said , the Commonwealth will under no circumstances yield to what he called naked aggression . ' Somberly , he admitted that Babur does appear to have great naval strength . He recalled the concentration of warcraft which human officers were invited to observe , shortly after a Baburite ship , with stunning insolence , radioed that first claim to Mirkheim from orbit around Earth . He said that , while information is far from complete , the signs are that Babur has somehow  --  unnoticedover a long period  --  built a fleet still larger than what it revealed . Nevertheless , Lapierre insisted , the Commonwealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quote , forceful measures . ' Sandra muttered an oath . This was ancient . The fastest hyperdrive vessel took worse than two weeks , Terrestrial calendar , to go fromp33Earth 's sun to Babur 's , Mirkheim 's , or Hermes ' . Between any two of those systems out in this sector , travel time must still be reckoned in days . Societies could put themselves on collision courses for sheer lack of data . She wished bitterly that some faster-than-light equivalent of radio existed . Although you could argue that because of isolation , the early colonistsof Hermes had been free to develop a new kind of civilization which , on the whole , she found good . . . . Not everybody did . The program gave a report , with visuals , of the latest Liberation Front rally . It had been held last night at a resort on the Longstrands . The intemperance of the orators and the size and enthusiasm of the crowd were worrying . If that many Travers would meet on a chilly seashore in person , how many more watched and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drove her to switch over to those memoranda which her staff had recorded for her while she slept . At once she slammed to full attention . Calisthenics forgotten , she crouched on the floor and stared at the image of her executive secretary . " About midnight , a ship belonging to the Supermetals Company landed at Williams Field , " his voice said . " The captain identified himself to the port authorities and got through to me at home . He urgentlyasked for a private interview with you , madame . I considered having you roused , but trust I did right in scheduling him for 0930 , subject to your approval . Meanwhile , as a precaution , I had his crew ordered to stay on board their vessel . " The commander 's a Wodenite hight Nadi . " Visuals showed the great shape striding among humans . " He heads the small defensive force which Supermetals maintains around Mirkheim . You 'll belike recall how , having captured the ship of Leonardo Rigassi , the recent rediscoverer , Nadi soon ordered her released , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ill will without much delaying the inevitable . " Instead , he says , the outfit has decided to appeal to Hermes , that we establish a protectorate over Mirkheim . This is what he wants to discuss with you . " Sandra stiffened . Is n't that a red-hot rivet dropped into my palm ! She forced herself to continue her gymnastics . They brought a measureof calm to which a cold shower added . She likewise took her time about braiding her hair and dressing . Her garments she made more formal than ordinarily , a gown whereon the only bright colorsp34belonged to the Tamarin family shoulder patch . With leisured strides , she sought her breakfast room . Her two younger children , the ones whom Pete had given her , were still abed . Eric was at the table , emptying his coffee cup in fierce draughts . The chamber was fragrant with cooking in the kitchen . The west wall was a vitryl pane whose view swept down that side of PilgrimHill , over the last buildings in Starfall , and on across intensely green farmland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Eric stood up at Sandra 's entrance , as men did for women on Hermes . He was clad in crisp tunic and breeks , but looked as if he had n't slept . Had he been out carousing ? Her oldest son and probableheir was a steady enough fellow as a rule , but sometimes the blood of his father rose in him . No , she decided after scanning his features , not this time . " Good morning , Mother , " he blurted . " Listen , I heard about Nadi , I 've been out and talked to him and his crew . . . . Will we grab the chance ? It 's going by almighty fast . " Sandra seated herself and tilted the coffeepot . " Come back down from the stratosphere , " she advised . " But we can do it ! " Eric paced before her . His soles clacked on the parquet . " Babur , the Commonwealth , the League , they 're ditheringdespite their brags , not ? Each fears to commit itself . A single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Sit down and eat , " Sandra said . " But  --  look you , Mother , you know I hold no roots-in-air notion of us as an imperial power . We could never stand against any of the others . If we 're there at Mirkheim , though , in possession , firmly allied with the original discoverers , who do own the clearest moral right , would the rest of them not hold back ? " " I ca n't tell . Moral rights seem of scant account these days . Do sit down . Your food will cool . " Eric obeyed . His right hand jerked through gestures while his left lay in a fist . " We 're the natural arbiters . None need be afraid of us . We could see to it that everybody gets a fair share . " Behind his homely visage was fire . " Only , damnation , first we 've need to assert ourselves ! Fast ! " " The Polesotechnic League has been suggested for the same role , " Sandra reminded him . " Them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When they 're toop35divided , too corrupt to control their own members according to the ethical rules in their own covenant  --  You jest , not ? " " I do n't know , " Sandra said heavily . " When I was young , the League was a force for peace because in the long run peace is more profitable than war . Now . . . sometimes I shudder . And sometimes I daydream that it can be reformed in time . " By men like Nicholas van Rijn , your father , Eric ? she wondered . Not that he would ever feel called on to carry out a holy mission . He 'd simply want to preserve his independence , by whatever means will also shake more money out of the universe . Is it too late for that ? Through her mind passed a swift review of history , as familiar as her own life but skimmed over once again in the dim hope of finding some hope . Given abundant nuclear energy , comparatively cheap and easily operated hyperdrive spacecraft , and related technological developments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any habitable planet should be self-sufficient , able to synthesize whatever did not occur naturally . In practice , it was often more economical to import goods , especially in view of restrictions on industry to preserve the environment . Besides , the wealthier Technic civilization grew , the more it dealt in luxuries , arts , services , and other commoditieswhich could not be duplicated at home . Private enterprise , ranging over greater reaches of space than any government , frequently where no effective government whatsoever existed , and soon becoming richer than any state , took over most of the Technic economy . The companies formed the Polesotechnic League as an association for mutual help and , to a degree , mutual discipline . The Pax Mercatoria spread among the stars . When did it go bad ? Did it succumb to the vices of its very virtues ? Often having to serve as their own magistrates , legislators , naval commanders , and being in any case usually rambunctious , acquisitive individualists with gigantic egos , the great merchants of the League began more and more to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coercion , venality , reckless exploitation . The sheer scale of operations and overwhelming rate of information flow made it apparently impossible to cope with much of this . No , wait . The League might have brought itself back under control just the same  --  had not the attempt at control created two mighty factionswhich as the years went on grew ever more unlike . There were the Home Companies , whose businesses were princi/pally within the Solar System : Global Cybernetics , General Atomistics , Unity Communications , Terran Synthetics , Planetary Biologicals . Their relationship with the dominant unions  --  United Technicians , Service Industries Workers , the Commonwealth Scientific Association  --  grew steadily closer . And there were the Seven In Space : Galactic Developments , XT Systems , Interstar Transport , Sanchez Engineering , Stellar Metals , Timebinders Insurance , Abdallah Enterprises  --  the corporate titans among the other suns . The rest , such as Solar Spice &; Liquors , remained precariously unallied , openly competitive . Most were essentially one-man or onefamilyfiefs . Does any future lie in them ? Are n't they mere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nick , my poor devil . . . . " Let be the brattling philosophy , and let 's get a Hermetian presence at Mirkheim , " Eric said . " If naught else , think you what a bargaining lever that gives us against the Seven . Long enough have they been jacking us up . We need n't fear the Commonwealth making war on us . Public opinion would n't stand for humans fighting humans while Babur gloats in the background , " " I 'm unsure of that . Nor am I sure Babur will sit passive . Frankly , that realm frightens me . " " Bluff . " " Count not on it . Everybody always supposed oxygen breathers and hydrogen breathers would never have any serious conflict because they want not the same real estate , and they 're mutually too alien for strife over ideologies . That 's why so little attention has been paid to Babur , why it 's still so mysterious . But . . . what intelligence I can get shows me the Imperial Band of Sisema as a powerful aggressorthat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet . And Mirkheim is real estate that everybody wants . " Not simply out of greed , Sandra 's mind went on . Already the supermetalsbegin to revolutionize technology , in electronics , alloys , nuclearprocesses , I know not what else . Did Babur get a hold on the sole source , Babur could deny the stuff to mankind . " I agree we humans had best put our feuds aside for a spell , " she said . " Maybe Hermes should cooperate with the Commonwealth . " " Maybe . But see you not , Mother , if we take charge first , we can set conditions for handing Mirkheim over and  --  Well , elsewise , if we stay put , we must needs take whatever somebody else chooses to dole out . " Not his spark of idealism but his angry impatience to act reminded Sandra of his father.  |p37A  Wodenite was not exactly inconspicuous among humans , and larynxes must be buzzing throughout Starfall . However , nobody else would listen to what she and Nadi said this morning . The room where they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wood-paneled , its windows open on a lawn where a mastiff kept watch . She had made it her own with souvenirs of her youthful offplanet travels : pictures of exotic scenes , odd little bits of art , weapons intended for nonhuman hands racked on the wall . Enteringsome minutes in advance of appointment time , she found her eye falling on a battle-ax from Diomedes . Her spirit followed , back through years , to Nicholas van Rijn . She had never loved the merchant . In many ways , even at that unfastidious stage of her life , she found him almost unendurably primitive . But that same raw vigor had saved both their lives on Diomedes . And she was looking for a man who would be a partner , neitherdomineering nor subservient toward her who was the likeliest successor to the throne of Hermes . ( Duke Robert was then old and childless . His niece Sandra was a natural choice for the electors , since not much else could be said for any of the other possible Tamarins . ) Nobody she had met on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why she went touring . Whatever his flaws , van Rijn was not a man she could be casual about . No previous affair of hers had been as full of thunderstorms and earthquakes  --  nor of memories to laugh or exult at afterward . When a year had passed , she knew he would n't consider marriage , or anything else she might want that he did n't . Eric was in her womb , because at the time she had been an ardent eugenicist . Regardless , she left . Van Rijn made no effort to stop her . Their parting was not altogether acrimonious , and they had exchanged a few business communications afterward whose tone was not unfriendly . As the years passed , she came to remember him in a more kindly fashion than at first  --  when she thought of him at all , which was seldom after she met Peter Asmundsen . He was Hermetian , not of the Kindred but of respectable Follower family ; he had organized and personally led enterprises on sister planets of the Maian System ; various deeds had made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and legally adopted Eric , the scandal that had surrounded her return home was laid to rest . Not that it had been much of a scandal . Under the influence of League and Commonwealth , the Hermetian aristocracy had acquired an easygoingattitude toward personal matters . Nevertheless , probably her consort had had a great deal to do with her election to the thronep38after Duke Robert 's death . And when Pete died  --  she did n't imagine she would ever want anybody else . Then why am I thinking about Nick , when I should be thinking about what to do with Nadi ? Because of Eric , I suppose . Eric will inherit this world as I have helped shape it , for weal or woe . So will Joan and Sigurd , of course ; but Eric may be saddled with the leadership of it . If aught is left to lead . She took a restless turn around the chamber , stopped at the ax and let her fingers curl around its haft . How she wished she could be out in this beautiful day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hovercycle at speeds which horrified her well-wishing subjects . Or she might visit the theatrical troupe she patronized ; her fascination with drama was lifelong . OrThe door opened . " Madame , Captain Nadi of the Supermetals Company , " said the guard , and closed it when the huge body had passed through . Sandra had never met a Wodenite before . Most of the dwellers on that planet were at a savage stage of technology , though they had apparentlydeveloped several intricate , subtle cultures . A few , in contact with Polesotechnic trading centers , had won scholarships or otherwiseearned their way into space . Nadi gravely offered his hand , which engulfed Sandra 's . The warmth of it surprised her ; she had unconsciouslyexpected a scaly being to be cool , as they were on Hermes or Earth . " Welcome , " she said a trifle uncertainly . " Thank you , my lady . " The Anglic was fluent , comprehensible though indescribably accented by the nonhuman conformation of the vocal tract . " I will endeavor not to take unduly much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to relate is of the highest importance to your people also . " " Belike true . Ah . . . I 'm sorry we 've no suitable furniture here . Please make yourself comfortable as best you can . " " I can quite well stand indefinitely in this low gravity . " The pull of Hermes was ninety-seven percent that of Earth . " I realize you humanssit by choice . " " I will . First , though , care you for a smoke ? Not ? Mind you if I light up ? Good . " Sandra took a cigar from a humidor , struck fire to it , and lowered herself into an heirloom armchair . Its carven massivenesswas somehow reassuring . The tobacco soothed her palate . " I will go directly to the point , " Nadi rumbled . " Do you know how and why I departed from Mirkheim ? "  |p39Sandra  nodded . She had spent an hour after breakfast getting informed . " You propose that we of Hermes act unilaterally , making ours the government in possession . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owners , my lady . Naturally , we understand you will have to grant accessto others . But you can regulate this so that each group will get a proper share , including ours . " " If the great powers will let us . " " They may be happy to have you present them with such a formula . Please believe me , this is not a sudden counsel of desperation on our part . We knew from the beginning that our monopoly would be short-lived , and studied possible tactics to use after the news was out . David Falkayn himself suggested Hermes as the eventual caretaker . True , he was only thinking of the Commonwealth versus the League as rivals for Mirkheim . He did not foresee Babur 's entry . However , we have decided his idea remains the best we have . " " David  --  the hero of the Shenna affair ? Said you his name ? " " You do not know ? I took for granted the story would be widespreadby now . " Nadi stood awhile silent . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head . At length : " Well , I will no longer be betraying a trust if I tell you , and it may be that you will understand our position better if you know of its ori-gins . " She settled back in her chair . He was right . If nothing else , a backgroundexplanation would give her nerves time to ease , her brain time to rally . " Go on , " she invited . " Eighteen standard years ago , " Nadi said , " David Falkayn , as you doubtless recall , was still a trade pioneer of the Solar Spice &; Liquors Company . Together with his partners , he went in secret , deliberately seeking a world like Mirkheim . Analysis of astronomical data showed him that possibly one existed , and approximately where it would be if it did . He found it , too . " Instead of notifying his employer , as a trade pioneer is supposed to do whenever he finds a promising new territory , Falkayn went elsewhere . He went to well-chosen leaders among the backward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neglect and abuse by the League had roused his indignation . He it was who got them to form a consortium for the purpose of mining and selling the wealth of Mirkheim , that the gain might go to their folk . " Sandra nodded . Since Rigassi 's expedition , spokesmen for Supermetalshad pleaded their cause in those terms . She remembered one man who had addressed an audience in Starf all :  | " . . . How will planets like Woden , Ikrananka , Ivanhoe , Vanessa  --  how will the inhabitants of planets like these reach the stars ? How will they come to share in the technology that eases labor , preserves health , prevents famine , educates , gives mastery over an indifferent nature ? They have hardly anything to market  --  a spice , a fur , a style of artwork , possibly a few natural resources like oils or easily availableminerals . They can not earn enough thus to buy spaceships , power plants , automatons , research laboratories , schools . The League has no interest in subsidizing them . Public and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Must whole races then spend millennia full of preventable anguish , in order to develop for themselves everything that has long existed elsewhere ? " And what of colonies planted by humans or Cynthians or other spacefaring species ? Not the prosperous , successful colonies like Hermes ; the gaunt ones , the outlying ones , whose settlers have little except the pride of independence . They can modify their harsh environmentsif they can buy the means . Else they risk final extinction . " The Supermetals Company was organized by trustworthy dwellers on such worlds . The profit to be won on a comparatively minor capital investment was fantastic . But would the magnates of the League respect their property rights ? Would governments leave them in sovereign peace ? The prize was too great for that  --  " " Ah . .. my lady ? " came Nadi 's voice . She started back out of her recollection . " I beg your pardon , " she said . " My mind wandered . " " I fear I have bored you . " " Not , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd like to hear details of the tricks you used to keep your holdings hidden . Evasive maneuvers when scouts trailed your ships , precautions against bribery , kidnap , extortion  --  ' T is amazing you lasted as long as you did . " " We saw the end was near when Falkayn 's employer , Nicholas van Rijn , deduced that the supermetals must come from a world of Mirkheim'stype , and used the same method of search to find it . . . . Did I distress you ? " " No . You , you surprised me . Van Rijn ? When ? " " Ten standard years ago . Falkayn and Falkayn 's future wife persuadedhim to maintain silence . In fact , he very kindly helped our agents keep the issue confused , to delay the eventual rediscovery . " " Mmm , yes , Nick would have gotten fun out of doing that . " Sandraleaned forward . " Well . This is fascinating , but ' t is past . As you remarked , I knew most of it beforehand , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I stay in touch . I sympathize wth you , but you real/ize my first duty is to Hermes . What can our people gain at Mirkheim that 's worth the cost and hazard ? " The giant being looked helpless and alone . " We beg for your assistance . In return for keeping us in business , you will become sharers in the wealth . " " And targets for everybody who wants that same share , or more . " Sandra drew hard on her cigar . " Maybe you 're not aware , Captain Nadi , I am no absolute ruler . The Grand Duke or Duchess is elected from the Tamarin family , which may not belong to any domain , by the presidents of the domains of Hermes . My powers are strictly limited . " " I understand , my lady . But I am told you can call a legislative assembly , electronically , on an hour 's notice . I am told that your leaders , living on a world which still has a frontier of wilderness , are used to making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevent whole armadas from clashing . But very little time remains for you to take action . If you do not move soon , then best you never move . " Sandra 's pulse accelerated . By cosmos , he 's right as far as he goes , she thought admidst the bloodbeat , he and Eric and . . . no few others , I 'm sure . The gamble is n't too much if we 're careful , if we keep a line of retreat open . I 'll need more information , more opinions , of course , before I can even raise the presidents and lay a recommendation before them . But at this moment I think we have a chance . Yes , we ! I 've been soberly hard-working too bloody damn long ; and I am commander-in-chief of the navy . If Hermes sends an expedition , I 'm going to lead it . The Council of the Polesotechnic League met in Lunograd to considerthe Mirkheim situation . Hastily convened , it did not include a representative of every member . Several heads of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave their work on notice that short . However , between them the Home Companiesp42and the Seven In Space almost made up a quorum , and speakers for enough of the unallied organizations arrived , or were already on hand , to complete it . After the first twenty-four hours of deadlock , Nicholas van Rijn invitedtwo delegates to his suite in the Hotel Universe . They accepted , which they would scarcely have done for any other independent . Van Rijn 's enterprise was sufficiently large and spread its tentacles sufficiently wide to make him powerful . Many observers found it hard to believe that , even with modern data and logic systems , one man could stay on top of it without having to incorporate like the giants . He was the natural leader of those outfits which had entered into no close-knitting agreements such as bound together the Seven In Space or the five Home Companies . For their parts , Bayard Story seemed to be the guiding genius of the first group and Hanny Lennart of the second . It was close to Lunar midnight . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a transparency was awesome . Buildings stood well apart and were not high . They must stay below the forcefields which kept air in this bubble and the ozone layer beneath . But between them were parks wherein the low gravity let trees soar and arch like the fountains , amidst fiercely colored great blossoms . Lamps , on posts formed to resemble vines , glowed everywhere . They did not haze view of the stark crater floor beyond the fields , of Plato 's ringwallshouldering in cliffs and steeps over the near horizon , or of the sky . Against infinite darkness , stars shone in their myriads , keen , jewel-hued , unwinking ; the Milky Way was a quicksilver river ; Earth 's heart-snaring loveliness hung blue and white in the south . Confrontingthat sight , the opulence of the chamber seemed tawdry . Lennart and Story arrived together . Van Rijn skipped across the floor to let them in . He had left unused the unit that could have suppliedTerrestrial weight . " Ho , ho , you been confabulating before you come here , nie ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do n't deny , do n't tell lies to a poor old lonely fat man who got one foot in the gravy . Come drink his liquor instead . " Story swept a glance across him and said genially , " For as far back as I 've heard about you , Freeman van Rijn , and that 's farther than I could wish , people tell how you 've been lamenting your age and feebleness . I 'd give long odds that you still have twenty years or more of devilment left . " " fa , I look healthy , me , built like a brick wedding cake . But low gee helps more than you think , you two what could be my son andp43daughter except I always had better taste in women . How I long for to retire , forsake the bumps and inanities of this wicked world , wash my soul clean of sin till it squeaks . " " In order to make room for new and bigger sins ?

The Council is an exercise in futility . I wonder why I bothered to come . " The others regarded him narrowly for a moment , as if they also wondered . They had never met him before this occasion ; they had only known  --  as a result of routine information gathering  --  that for the past ten years his name had been on the list of directors of Galactic Developments , in that corporation 's headquarters on Germania . Evidentlyhe was so rich and influential that he could kill publicity about himself and operate almost invisibly . He was a rather handsome man , medium-sized , slender , his featuresregular in a tanned rectangular face , eyes blue-gray , hair and mustache smooth brown with a sprinkling of white . An elastic gait indicated that he used his muscles a good deal , perhaps under intermittentlysevere conditions . His soft speech held a trace of nonTerrestrialaccent , though it was too far eroded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subdued greens fitted him as if grown from his body . Beside him , dark-clad Lennart looked dowdy and haggard . Beside either of them , van Rijn was outrageous in his favorite clothes of snuff-stained ruffled blouse and a sarong wrapped around his Jovian equator . " Eat , drink , smoke , " the host urged , waving at a well-stocked portablebar , trays of intricate canapes , boxes of cigars and cigarettes . He himself held a churchwarden pipe which had seen years of service and grown fouler for each day of them . " I wanted we should talk here , not on a circuit with seals , so we could relax , act honest , not have to resent what anybody maybe says . " Story nodded and took Scotch whisky in the civilized manner , neat with a water chaser . Van Rijn refilled a tumbler of Genever gin , addinga dash of what he called angst en onrust bitters . They settled down in loungers . Lennart sat upright on a sofa opposite , accepting nothing . " Well , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We should see if we can compromise , or if not that , map out our areas of disagreement . Right ? " Story supplied.  | " Also horse-trade information , " van Rijn said . " That can be a mighty valuable commodity , especially when it 's in short supply , " Story observed . " I hope you realize neither of us can make promises , Freeman van Rijn . " Lennart clipped off each word . " We are simply executives of our corporations . " She herself was a vice president of Global Cybernetics . " And in fact , neither the Home Companies nor the Seven form a monolith . They are only tied together by certain business agreements . " The recital of what a schoolboy should know did not insult van Rijn . " Plus interlocking directorates , " he added blandly , taking up a tiny sandwich of smoked eel upon cold scrambled egg . " Besides , each of you got more voice in things than you let on , ja , you can bellow like wounded blast furnaces any time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean is the Seven is one cartel and the Home Companies another , and got plenty of political flunkies in high places . " " Not us in the Commonwealth , " Story said . " That 's become your plutocracy , Freelady Lennart , not ours . " Her thin cheeks flushed . " You can say that truly of your poor little puppet states on their poor little planets , " she retorted . " As for the Commonwealth , we 've now had fifty years of progressive reforms to strengthen democracy . " " By damn , " van Rijn muttered , " maybe you really believe that . " " I hope we are n't here to rehearse stale partisan politics , " Story said . " Me too , " van Rijn answered . " That is what it will amount to , what the Council will do if we leave it to itself . Members will take their positions and then not be able to get off because they have spread so much manure around . They will quarrel till plaster falls from the sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few leaders agree to let it happen . That is what I want us to wowpow about . " " The issues are simple , " Lennart declared . She repeated what she had said more than once at the conference table . " Mirkheim is too valuable , too strategic a resource , to be allowed to fall into the claws of beings that have demonstrated their hostility . I include certain human beings . The Commonwealth has a just title to sovereignty over it , inasmuch as the original discoverers represented no governmentwhereas the Rigassi expedition was composed of our citizens . The Commonwealth likewise has a duty to mankind , to civilization itself , to safeguard that planet . The Home Companies support this . It'sp45a patriotic obligation , and I am frankly surprised that persons of your education do n't recognize it . " " My education was in the school of hard knockers , " van Rijn replied . " Yours too , I suspect , Freeman Story , ha ? You and me should understand each other . " " I understand why you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A discussion of morals would embarrass you . " " Well , speaking of morals , and immorals too , " van Rijn said , " what about those original discoverers of Mirkheim , ha ? What rights you think they have ? " " That can be decided in the courts , after Mirkheim is secured . " " Ja , ja , in courts whose judges you buy and sell like shares of stock . I hear a background noise already , you whetting your lawyers . That was why the Supermetals Company worked in secret . " Story raised his brows . " Do you expect us to believe , Freeman , that you aided and abetted them for a decade out of an abstract sense of justice ? " " What makes you suppose I was in any plot , a plain old peddler of belly comfort like me ? " " It 's not been made public , but Rigassi learned from the workers at Mirkheim that a member of the Polesotechnic League had been helping in their cover-up , ever since he tracked the planet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were simply , rather pathetically , trying to seem stronger than they are  --  " Lennart drew a sharp breath . " How do you know that ? " she exclaimed . Story grinned . He was not about to reveal whatever espionage systemhis bloc maintained . He continued addressing van Rijn : " In retrospect , the man has to have been you . And a gorgeous job you did . Especially those hints you let drop , those clues you let be found , indicatingan entire civilization more advanced than ours was producingthe supermetals . Expeditions going solemnly out in search . . . Surely the most magnificent hoax in history . " After a moment : " Do you mind telling us why you did it ? " you would call me a liar if I said I thought it was the right thing , and could be I would myself . " Van Rijn swallowed a confectionof Limburger cheese and onion on pumpernickel , tamped his pipe with a horny forefinger , and drank smoke . " I admit , partly I got talked into it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , between blowingrings . " And partly , for independents like me , is best if supermetalsbe on a free market . I do n't want either of your cartels having thep46power that a Mirkheim monopoly in your hands would give . The original outfit , it is more reasonable . " That was what he had argued for at the Council : that the PolesotechnicLeague exert the might it had when it was united , in an effort to have Mirkheim declared a stateless planet under the protection of the League , which Supermetals would join . He knew perfectly well that there was no chance of the resolution being adopted unless a lot of hard minds got changed . The Home Companies insisted that they would support the Commonwealth 's cause ; the Seven were for the entireLeague holding clear of any struggle , strictly neutral and prepared to negotiate with whatever party won . He now pursued the matter . " Story , it does not make sense we should sit by and piddle on our thumbs . Freelady Lennart has right as far as she goes : if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us . And Babur is perhaply better armed than the Commonwealth . It for sure has shorter lines of communication . " " Who brought affairs to this pass ? " Lennart 's tone grew shrill . " Who first began trading with the Baburites , sold them the technologythat got them into space , for a filthy profit ? The Seven ! " " We had dealings , yes , " Story said mildly . " At the time , that kind of transaction was standard practice , you recall . Nobody objected . Subsequently  --  well , I admit our companies let trade fall to almost nothing because it was no longer paying very well , not because we foresaw Babur 's arming . We did n't . Nobody did . Who would have ? Just the research and development necessary  --  incredible they could do it in so few years . " But . " He made a lecturer 's gesture . " But from our earlier experience , we know we can do business with the Baburites . The possibility that we 'll have to buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll have to buy them from the Home Companies , which is what a Commonwealth takeover would amount to . We 'll still have things to exchange that Babur needs . " " Would you not prefer buying at a cheaper price from the present owners , and from other companies that will also work Mirkheim and sell on the open market ? " van Rijn asked . " They wo n't necessarily be cheaper , " Story said . " Oxygen breathers are too apt to be in direct competition with us . " He bridged his fingers and looked across them first at Lennart , then at van Rijn . " To be blunt , I think most of the fear of Babur is nothing but a child 's fear of the unfamiliar . You never took the trouble to learn about it , when it seemed to be only one more obscure planet off inp47the fringes of known space . But I happen to be a former xenologist , who specialized in subjovians . I 've studied all records the Seven have of their dealings with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked with its leaders . So I tell you  --  and I 'm here to tell the entire Council  --  Babur 's no den of ogres . It 's the home of a species as reasonable by their lights as we are by ours . " " Exactly , " van Rijn growled . " God help reason , if we and they is the best it can do . But I had a little brush-up with the Baburites myselfonce . I also have lately been scanning what data on them can be got here in the Solar System . Their lights is very flickery . " " Their claim to Mirkheim is ridiculous , " Lennart put in . " Nothing but a slogan for territorial aggression . " " Not in terms of their own dominant culture , " Story said . " Then it is n't a culture we can afford to let become strong . It makes no bones about intending to establish an empire . If that meant only Babur-type worlds , perhaps we could live with it . But as I read their statements and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that entire volume of space . That can not be tolerated . " " How will you stop it ? " " For a start , by taking appropriate action at Mirkheim . Quickly , decisively . Our intelligence indicates Babur will back down from a fait accompli . " " Our ' intelligence ? " Story murmured . " How good are your connectionsto the Ministry of Defense ? " Van Rijn jetted thick blue clouds . " I think you just answered something I was n't so sure about , Lennart , " he said . She stared . Apprehension crossed her features . " I did n't  --  I am only advocating , personally , you realize  --  " " I got connections of my own . Not to nothing secret , like you seem to . But so simple a datum as clearances of civilian craft for deep space  --  suddenly for a while a lot of them got to wait  --  that kind of thing  --  ja , drop by drop by drop of fact I collect , till I got a full jigsaw puddle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have known you , Lennart , that says much too . " Van Rijn stood up , lightly in the low weight , like a rising moon which eclipsed the radiance of Earth . " Story , " he said , " it will not be announced right away , but I bet you rubies to rhubarb the Commonwealthgovernment has already dispatched a task force to Mirkheim . And I am not the least bit sure Babur will take that meekly-weakly . " He turned to a little Martian sandroot statuette of St. Dismas that stood on the bar , his traveling companion of a lifetime . " Better get busy and pray for us , " he told it.  |p48Under  full hyperdrive , spaceship Muddlin ' Through fared from the Solar System toward the sun that men had named Mogul . Pulsed Schrodinger waves drove her at a pseudovelocity equivalent to thousandsof times the true speed of radiation ; and in galactic terms those stars were near neighbors . Yet her clocks would have registered two and a half weeks when she reached her destination . So big is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can not comprehend what they are doing . David Falkayn , Chee Lan , Adzel , and Muddlehead were in the saloonplaying poker . Rather , the first three were . The computer was represented by an audiovisual sensor and a pair of metal arms . It was an advanced model , functioning at consciousness level , very little of its capability needed en route to maintain the systems of the ship . The live travelers had even less to do . " I 'll bet a credit , " said Chee . A blue chip clattered to the middle of the table . " Dear me . " Adzel laid down his hand . " Can I fetch more refreshmentfor anyone ? " " Thanks . " Falkayn held out an empty beer mug . " I 'll raise . " He doubled the bet . After half a minute during which the faint purr of engines and ventilators came through silence : " Hey , Muddlehead , what 's keeping you ? " " The probabilities for and against me are calculable as being exactlybalanced , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seconds . " Very well , " it decided , and matched Falkayn . " Ki-yao ? " wondered Chee . Her whiskers dithered , her tail switched the stool on which she sat . " Well , if you insist . " She raised back . Inwardly , the human jubilated . He had a full house . Outwardly , he pretended to ponder before he raised again . Muddlehead saw him . " Are you sure you do n't need some readjustment somewhere ? " Falkaynasked it . " Whom the gods would destroy , " said Chee smugly . Again shep49raised back . Meanwhile Adzel , his hoofs thudding on the carpet , returned with Falkayn 's beer . The Wodenite himself refrained from drinking it on a voyage  --  no ship could have carried enough  --  and insteadsipped a martini in a one-liter chillglass . Falkayn raised another credit . Muddlehead saw . Chee and Falkayn peered its way , as if they could read an expression in the vitryl lens . Slowly , Chee added two chips to the pot . Falkayn suppressed a grin and raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood on end . " Damn your mendacious transistors to hell ! " she screamed , and threw down her hand . Falkayn hesitated . Muddlehead had implied its cards were mediocre , but  --  He called . His opponent revealed four queens . " What the jumping blue blazes ? " Falkayn half rose . " You said the probabilities  --  " " I referred to the odds in favor of suckering you , " explained Muddlehead , and raked in the pot . " It appears that after our long hiatus , we will have to learn each other 's styles of play ab initio , " Adzel remarked . " Well , listen . " Chee shuffled the deck . " I 'm growing tired of nothing but straight poker . Dealer 's choice , right ? I say seven card stud , low hole wild . " Falkayn grimaced . " That 's a nasty thing to say . " " The odds in wild card games are precisely as determinable as those in the standard versions , " declared Muddlehead . " Yes , but you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cut ? " Chee asked Adzel . " What ? " The dragon blinked . " Oh  --  oh , my apologies . I was taking the opportunity to meditate . " With astonishing delicacy , an enormous hand split the pack . The beating he took in that round did not seem to disturb his feelings . But when the deal came to him , he announced placidly , " This will be baseball . " " Oh , no ! " Falkayn groaned . " What 's happened to you two in the past three years ? " He soon folded and sat grimly drinking and thinking . His turn arrived . " I 'll show you bastards , " he said . " This will be Number One . You know it ? Seven card stud , high-low , kings and tens wild for low , sevens and deuces wild for high . " " Om mani padme hum , " whispered Adzel shakenly . Chee arched her back and spat . Settling down again on her cushion , she protested , " Muddlehead could blow a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than computing an entry orbit , " the ship reassured her , " though rather more ridiculous . " The game went on , in a weird fashion . Falkayn took the whole pot , largely by default . " I hope we 've all learned our lesson , " he said . " Your deal , Muddlehead . " " I believe I am also permitted to call an unorthodox game , " replied the machine . Falkayn winced , Chee Lan bottled her tail , but Adzel proposed , " Fair is fair . However , let us thereafter confine ourselves to straight draw and stud . " " My assessment is that this one will confirm you in that desire , " Muddlehead told them , shuffling . " It is played like draw except that there is no point in drawing . Players pick up their cards with the backs toward them , so that each can see the hand of everybody but himself . " After a shocked silence , Chee demanded : " What kind of perverts were they that gave you your last overhaul ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ types of task for which I am built , " the computer reminded her . " Thus whenever I am activated but idle , I endeavor to make that idleness creative . " " I think the Manichaean heresy just scored a point , " said Adzel . Van Rijn would have understood the reference , but it went by Falkayn , though he was reasonably well-read . At least play was mercifully short . At its end , the man rose . " Deal me out , " he said . " I want to check on dinner . " Gourmet cooking was among the hobbies with which he passed the time on voyages , as painting and sculpture were for Chee , music and the study of Terrestrialhistory for Adzel . Having basted the roast , he did not immediately return to the saloonbut lit his pipe and sought the bridge . His footfalls sounded loud . This was during the period of several hours per twenty-four when the ship 's gravity generator was set at fifty-five percent above Earth 's pull , to accustom the crew to what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An added forty-five kilos of weight did not unduly tire him . It was uniformly distributed over a body in good condition . What he and his mates had to adapt was chiefly their cardiovascularsystems . Nonetheless he felt the heaviness in his bones . On the bridge , optical compensators projected an exact simulacrumof whichever half of the sky they were set to show . Falkayn stopped at the control board . Beyond the glowing instruments , darknessroofed him in , housing a wilderness of stars . They gleamed at him from every side , sword-sharp swarms , the Milky Way an argentp51cataract , the Magellanic Clouds and the Andromeda galaxy made small and strange by distances he would never see overleaped . As if he felt the elemental cold between them , he cradled the bowl of his pipe in one fist , his campfire symbol . Beneath the susurrus of the ship lay an infinite stillness . And yet , he thought , yonder suns were not quiet . They were appallinglyaflame ; and the spaces roiled with matter , seethed with energy , travailed with the birth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universe eternal ; it had its strange destiny . To look into it was to know the sorrow and glory of being alive . More than once Coya had gotten her wish that they make love here . Falkayn 's eyes sought in the direction of Sol , though it had long since dwindled from sight . His trained gaze could still find its way among constellations that had changed , some beyond recognition , and were nearly drowned in the number of stars that shone through airlessness . How are you doing now , darling ? he wondered , knowing full well that " now " was a noise without meaning when cried across the interstellar reaches . I did n't expect to feel homesick on this trip . I forgot that home is where you are . He recognized his regret as being partly guilt . He had not been frank with her . In his judgment , this journey held more dangers than he had admitted . ( But then , she had tried to hide from him that she thought the same . ) Regardless , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in him , after three staid years . Some lines passed through his head , from the archaic poetry which was a special interestof his : " I am a part of all that I have met ; Yet all experience is an arch wherethro ' Gleams that untravell 'd world , whose margin fadesFor ever and for ever when I move . How dull it is to pause , to make an end , To rust unburnish 'd , not to shine in use ! As though to breathe were life . . . . " Consoling himself with smoke , he decided he might as well admit that he had a hopeless case of go-fever . Coya and , yes , the kids could come a-roving with him later . Meanwhile " My mariners , Souls that have toil 'd , and wrought , and thought with me  --  That ever with a frolic welcome tookThe thunder and the sunshine , and opposedFree hearts , free foreheads  --  "  |p52A  chuckle interrupted . Neither Adzel nor Chee Lan would take kindly to the idea of manning oars in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equally curious things from time to time , and might again . He 'd better get back to the game . After dinner , if their mood suited , he 'd break out his fiddle and play for them . The sight of those two dancing a jig together never wearied him . The sun of Babur was more than twice as bright as Sol ; but the planet was more than six times as far from its luminary as Earth . Thus Mogul stood in the spatial sky as a tiny disc of unbearable brilliance . A moon of Babur 's four was close enough to show craters ; the rest were like small sharp sickles . The world itself was a tawny globe partly shaded by night , partly veiled by bands and swirls of cloud , white tinged with gold , brown , or pale red . The majesty of the sight gave Falkayn to understand why its human discoverer had named it for a conqueror who went down in the memory of India as the Tiger . He did n't know how well he chose , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only a breath from the ventilators to be heard . Hyperdrive was off and Muddlin ' Through maneuvering on grays at a true speed of a few kilometers per second . Chee was in the weapons control turret , Adzel in the engineroom : their trouble stations . On Falkayn rested the burden of deciding when danger grew so great as to require fight or flight . He doubted that either would be possible here . The two warcraft that had challenged the ship as she approached and escorted her in now flanked and paced her arrowhead hull like wolves herding along a prey . Distance made them tiny until Falkayn magnified their sections of the view ; then he saw them the size of a Technic destroyer but much more heavily armed , flying arsenals . When Muddlehead spoke , he started , fetching up short against the safety web that held him in his seat . " I have commenced analysis of data obtained from neutrino and mass detectors , radar , gravity and hyperdrive pulse registers , and the local interplanetary field . Subject to correction , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one is of a size to be a possible dreadnought or equivalentthereof . Many of the rest appear to be noncombatant , perhaps groundable transports . More detailed information should be available presently . " " Fifty ? Huh ? " Falkayn exclaimed . " But we know  --  Babur put on that show near Valya  --  we know its fleet is at least equal to the Commonwealth 's . Where are the majority ? " His companions had been listening on the intercom . Adzel 's slow basso rolled forth : " It is fruitless to speculate . We lack facts about Babur 's plans , or even about the society whose masters have hatched those plans . " Nobody paid attention until too late , Falkayn thought . Not to hydrogenbreathers , who are alien , who can offer us oxygen breathers very little in the way of markets or resources , and by the same token should find nothing to quarrel with us about . There were too many planets which did lure us with treasure , with homesteads , with native beings not hopelessly unlike ourselves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as old and many-faced and full of marvels as ever Earth was . " I think I know where their missing ships are , " Chee said . " They were never intended to orbit idle . " Falkayn 's mind paced a rutted track : How did Babur do it  --  how build up so great a strength in a mere twenty or thirty years ? They could n't simply put armament on copies of the few merchant vessels they 'd produced . Nor could they simply work from plans of human men-of-war . Everything had to be adapted to the peculiar conditions of Babur , the peculiar requirements of its life forms . He recalled the shapes of the ships escorting his , bulge-bellied as if pregnant ( with what sort of birth to come ? ) . The extra volume housed cryogenic tanks . Air recycling alone was not adequate for hydrogenbreathers , whose atmosphere leaked slowly out between the atoms of a hull and must be replenished from liquid gases . A thin plating of a particular supermetal alloy could cure that  --  but no Baburiteknew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found a navy . And the leakage problem was only the most easy and obvious of those the engineers had met . The research and development effort before manufacture could begin must have been extraordinarily sophisticated . How could the Baburites complete it in the time it had actually taken , they who had never gotten off their home world when men first found them ? Could they have hired outside experts ? If so , whose , and how could they pay them ?  |p54His  repetition of questions which had been raised since the menace first manifested itself , to no avail , was broken off . Muddlehead was making one of its rare contributions to talk : " Conceivably the Baburiteshave been anticipating fights with other hydrogen breathers . " " No , " Adzel replied . " There are n't any with comparable technology , anywhere in known space , except the Ymirites ; and they are as different from the Baburites as they are from us . " " I suggest you write me a program in political science , " the computersaid . " Will you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The fact is they 've got far fewer ships here than we know they own . And I share Chee 's foul notion of where the rest of those ships have gone . If we  --  " His outercom chimed . He switched it on , and the screen filled with the image of a Baburite . Around the eldritch **27;4477;TOOLONG shape , which did not really look like any of those animals , shadowy figures flitted through gloom . Four tiny eyes behind a spongy snout could not make true contact with his . The being hummed its League Latin , noises which a vocalizer transposed into the proper phonemes . " We have notified the Imperial Band of Sisema and you are about to receive your instructions . Stand by . " The statement was neither polite nor rude ; it announced how things were . Then the image faded out . For a minute Falkayn sat alone with his thoughts . Again they ran back over what little he knew . " Sisema " was nothing but the vocalizer 's rendition of a sound that in the original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Baburite attempt , probably suggested by earlier human visitors , to translate a concept that had no counterpart on Earth . Seemingly in Acarro  --  as the vocalizer called one region on the planet  --  the unit of society was not individual , family , clan , or tribe . It was an association of beings , tied together by bonds more powerful and pervasive than any that men could experience , involving some mutuality or complementarity of their sexual cycles but extending from this to every aspect of life . Each Band had its own personality , which differed more from that of its fellow Bands than members of any did from each other . Yet informantshad told xenologists that every single member was unique , with a special contribution to make ; the merging together was not subordination , it was communication ( communion ? ) on a level deeper than consciousness . Telepathy ? It was hard to know what such a word might mean on this world , and the informants had been unwilling or unable to speak further . A Baburite did radiate variablyp55at radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instrument in the neighborhood . If that was due to neurochemistry ( ? ) , perhaps another nervous system ( ? ) could act as a receiver . Perhaps in this way a part of tradition was not oral or written but directly perceived . Potentially immortal , a Band recruited itself by adoption as much as by reproduction . Cross-adoptions linked various groups as crossmarriageshad once allied human families . The Imperial Band seemed to have first choice in such cases , and to that extent was dominant , providing a leadership that had finally brought the entire planet under its sway . Yet it was not a true monarchy or dictatorship . Selfregulating , not given to conflict with their own kind , the Bands needed little government in the Terrestrial sense . Which made their sudden aggressiveness all the less comprehensible , Falkayn thought . They 'd tried some sharp business in this sector thirty years ago , and been worsted by the Solar Spice &; Liquorsfactor  --  but sunblaze , that was a trivial incident , no cause for them lately to start trumpeting about their " right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dividing the stars up into spheres of interestseem like a safe one . The League could not tolerate that , if the League wanted to survive as a set of free-market entrepreneurs . The Commonwealth might accept the principle . . . but not if that involvedloss of Mirkheim , the exact explosive issue Babur had chosen for precipitating the crisis . I suppose even the agents of those companies of the Seven that formerly traded here have been baffled to foresee what minds so strange to us will do next  --  Roy ! Again the screen gave him the picture of a Baburite . Though Fatkaynwas well schooled in noting individual differences between nonhumans , he identified this one as new only by the color and cut of robe . The outlandishness of the whole simply drowned every detail in his perception . " You are Captain Ah-kyeh ? " the being demanded without preamble . It had not heard his name well enough to hum an accurate equivalent . " This member speaks to you for the Imperial Band of Sisema . You have told our sentinels your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The muscles tightened around Falkayn 's belly and between his shoulderblades . For an instant he was more conscious of stars , planet , moons , sun in the hemisphere above him than he was of the image he confronted . To go down in death , losing all that splendor , losing Coya and Juanita and the child unborn . .. But those warcrafthemming him in would not wantonly open fire . Would they ?  |p56The  habit of courage took charge of him and he answered steadily : " Forgive me if I leave off a greeting or similar courtesy . I 've been told your people do n't employ such phrases , at least not with a foreignspecies . " Sensible . What rituals could we possibly have in common ? " My partners and I are here not on behalf of any government , but as representatives of a company in the Polesotechnic League , Solar Spice &; Liquors . We know you had a dispute with us on the planet we call Suleiman , somewhat more than two of your years ago . We hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He employed a vocalizer himself , not because he knew anything of the other sophont 's language , but in order that it might convert his words into sounds that the latter could readily hear . He wondered how badly his meaning got distorted . If the Siseman speech had been tonal like Chinese , little but gibberish would have gotten through . The Baburite was wise to require reiteration . " We listen , " it said . " I 'm afraid I have n't any precise plan to describe . The conflict over Mirkheim disturbs us greatly . By us ' I mean , here , the company for which my companions and I work . And of course the leaders of associated firms feel the same way . A war would be as disastrous to trade as to everything else . Besides , uh , economic motives , common decency demands we do whatever we can to help prevent it . You doubtless know the Polesotechnic League is not a government , but commands comparable power . It will gladly lend its good offices towardreaching a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entire League . It no longer has a single voice . " Touche/ thought Falkayn , and felt indeed as if a blade had pierced him . How in cosmos do the Baburites know that ? They ought to be as ignorant of the ins and outs of Technic politics as we are of theirs . True , if they 've been preparing for a long time to fight us , they 'd investigate us carefully beforehand . But when did they , and how ? A Baburite traveling around among us and asking questions would be too conspicuous for van Rijn not to have heard about . And surely they could n't rely on occasional traders from the Seven for such information , especially after that trade became practically extinct . The fact that they are this well-informed is a flamingly important datum all by itself . Van Rijn needs to know . He had reached his conclusion in a nearly intuitive leap . Best not to let the officer ( ? ) guess how dismayed he was . " We will be glad to discuss that with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If we can give some understanding , and gain some for ourselves , that will makep57our journey a success . I 'd like to emphasize that we do n't represent the Commonwealth in any way . In fact , none of us three is a citizen of it . No matter who gets Mirkheim in the end , companies of the League will be dealing with them , " unless Babur gets it and then keeps the supermetals exclusively for itself . " I hope you will regard us as ambassadors of a sort , " who double in espionage if they get the chance . " We 're experienced in dealing with different races , so maybe we have more chance than average of exchanging information and ideas . " The Baburite fired several disconcertingly shrewd queries , which Falkayn answered as evasively as he dared . Since the being knew the League was divided against itself , he strove to give the impression of a less serious breach than was the case . At last his interrogator said , " You will be conducted to a landing place on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we can quite well stay in our ship , in orbit , and communicate by screen , " Falkayn said . " No . We can not allow an armed vessel , surely equipped with surveillancedevices , to remain loose in local space . " " I can see that , but , um . . . we could set down on a moon . " " No . It will be necessary to study you at length , and you may not have access to your ship . Else you might try to break away from us if the process takes an inconvenient turn . A guide vessel is on its way . Do as its chieftain commands you . " The screen blanked . Falkayn sat still for a while , hearing Chee swear .. " Well , " he said at last , " if nothing else , we 'll get a close look at the ground . Keep those surveillance devices busy , Muddlehead . " " They are , " the computer assured him . " Data analysis is also proceeding . It has become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oxygen breathers . " " Huh ? " " Infrared radiation shows their internal temperatures are too high for denizens of this planet . " " Yes , yes , obviously , " Chee 's voice came . " But what are the crews ? Mercenaries ? How in the name of Nick van Rijn 's hairy navel did the Baburites contact them , let alone recruit them ? " " I suspect those are questions we are better off not asking , " Adzel said . " To be sure , we must try to find the answers . " The guide came in sight , larger than Muddlin ' Through but with similar streamlining proving that she was groundable . The part of her armament that showed was by itself more than the League ship carried . Falkayn did not propose making a dash for freedom.  |p58Having  received his travel orders and turned them over to Muddleheadto execute , he gave his attention to the viewsereen hemisphere . From time to time he rotated the scene or enlarged a part of it . He wanted to see everything he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useful . This was a new , utterly strange world on which he was about to tread . A world . After all his years of roving , and even today when he fared under guard , the old thrill tingled through him . Babur swelled in his sight as the ships accelerated inward . The approachcurve took him around the globe , and he saw the tiny , fiery sun set in gold and rise in scarlet over an ocean of subtly tinted clouds . Then he was braking heavily and the planet was no longer before him or beside him , it was below . A thin scream of split atmospherereached his ears . The stars of space vanished in a sky gone purple . Lightning flared across a storm far under this hurtling hull . The surface came in view . Mountains glimmered blue-white , either sheathed in ice or purely glacial . Here water was a solid mineral . The liquid that took its place was ammonia . Air was hydrogen and helium , with traces of ammonia vapor , methane , and more complex organiccompounds . Certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heaved gray beneath rosy clouds . It was small for a body with twelve and a third times the mass of Earth , two and four-fifths times the diameter . Ammonia is less plentiful than water . The interiorsof the enormous continents were arid ; there the black vegetation grew sparsely , glittering dust scudded across the horizon 's vast circle , and never a trace of habitation showed . A volcano blew flame and smoke on high . It did not erupt like one on Earth ; it was melting itself , streams raging forth and congealing into mirror-bright veins and sheets . The very structure of Babur was unearthly , a metallic core overlaid with ice and rocky strata , water in the depths compressed into a hot solid ever ready to expand explosively when that pressure happened to ease . Here there were true Atlantises , lands that sank beneath the waves in a year or less ; new countries were upheaved as fast . Falkayn glimpsed such a place , hardly touched as yet by life , raw ranges and plains still ashudder with quakes . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desert and then a fertile seaboard . A forest was squat trees on which long black streamers of leaves were fluttering . Aerial creatures breasted a gale on stubby wings . A leviathan beast wallowed blue in a gray lake beneath a lash of ammonia rain . Wilderness yielded to farms , darklingfields laid out in hexagons , houses built of gleaming ice andp59anchored with cables against storms . By magnification , Falkayn spied workers and their draft animals . He could barely tell the species apart . Would a Baburite see as little distinction between a man and a horse ? A city appeared on the shore . Because it could not grow tall , it spread wide , kilometers of domes , cubes , pyramids in murky colors . In what seemed to be a new section , buildings were aerodynamically designed to withstand winds stronger than would ever blow across Earth . Wheeled and tracked vehicles passed among them , aircraft above  --  but remarkably little traffic for a community this size . The city went below the curve of the world . " Make for that field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pavement , studded with great circular coamings that were mostly covered by hinged metal discs . A few stood open , revealing hollow cylinders beneath , sunk deep into the ground . It had been explained to him that for safety 's sake , spacecraft which landed here were housed in such silos . The guide told him which to take , and Muddlehead eased its hull down . " Here we are , " Falkayn said unnecessarily . The words came dull and loud , now that his view was only of fluoro-lit blankness . " Let 's get our suits on pronto . Our hosts might not like to be kept waiting . . . . Muddlehead , hold all systems ready for action . Do n't let anybody or anything in except one of us . In case of arguments about that , refer the arguer to us . " " We might want a countersign , " came Adzel 's voice . " Good thinking , " Falkayn said . " Hm . . . does everybody know this ? " He whistled a few bars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One-Ball Riley . ' " Beneath his cheerfulness , he thought , What does it matter ? We 're totally at their mercy . And then : Not necessarily , by God ! At the main personnel lock , he , Adzel , and Chee donned their spacesuits . They took time for a complete checkout . The walk ahead of them was short , but the least failure would be lethal . " Fare you well , Muddlehead , " said Adzel before he closed his faceplate . " Provided you do n't sit here inventing new distortions of poker , " Chee added . " Would backgammon variations interest you ? " asked the computer . " Come on , let 's move along , for Job 's sake , " Falkayn said . Having completed their preparations , they took each a readypackedpersonal kit and cycled through the lock . A platform elevator in a recess in the silo wall , with an up-and-down lever control , bore them to the top . Adzel was forced to use it alone , and at that most ofp60him hung over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry him was suggestive . It was meant solely for passengers ; elsewhere on the field Falkayn had seen support cradles for ships that were to be loaded or unloaded , and cargo handling equipment . So the Baburites had visitors bigger than themselves often enough to justify a machine like this , did they ? As he emerged , Falkayn paid attention also to the controls of the hatch cover . A wheel steered a small motor which ran the hydraulic system moving the heavy piece of metal up or down . Heavy .. . Unrelieved by his vessel 's interior gee field , weight smote him . Without optical amplification , his eyes saw the world as twilit . Mogul glared low above buildings on his left , near the end of Babur 's short day . Clouds hung amber in purple heaven ; beneath them blew a ruddy wrack . With three and a third Terrestrial atmospheresof pressure behind it , the wind made motion through it feel like wading a river . Its sound was shrill , as was every noise borne by this air . Several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way to go , they led the newcomers trudging across the expanse . A complex occupied an entire side of it . When close , able to make out details through the dusk , Falkayn recognized the structure . No workshopor warehouse of ice such as shimmered elsewhere , this was a man-made environmental unit , a block fashioned of alloys and plasticschosen for durability , thick-walled , triple-insulated . Light from some of the reinforced windows glowed yellow . Inside , he knew , the air was warm and recycled . As part of that cycle , the hydrogen that seeped through was catalytically treated to make water . The helium that entered took the place of a corresponding amount of nitrogen . A frith of the gas was oxygen . A gray generator kept weight at Terrestrialstandard . " Our home away from home , " he muttered . Chee 's astonishment sounded in his radio earphones : " This large a facility ? How many do they house at a time ? And why ? " A member of the escort thrummed into a communicator beside an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a couple of minutes the outer valve swung back . The three from Sol entered the chamber in response to gestures . There was barely room for them . Pumps roared , sucking out Babur 's air . Gas from the interior gushed through a nozzle . The inner valve opened . Beyond was an entryroom , empty save for a spacesuit locker . Two beings waited . They were lightly clad , but they carried sidearms . Onep61was a Merseian , a biped whose face was roughly manlike but whose green-skinned body , leaning stance , and ponderous tail were not . The other was a human male . Falkayn stepped out , almost losing his balance as the pull on him dropped . He unlatched his faceplate.  --  Hello , " he heard . " Welcome to the monastery . "  --  Thanks , " he mumbled . " A word of warning first , " the man said . " Do n't try making trouble , no matter how husky your Wodenite friend is . The Baburites have armed watchers everywhere . Cooperate with me , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for quite a spell . " tWhy ?  --  " You ca n't expect they 'll let you go till the war is over , can you ? Or do n't you know ? The main fleet of Babur is off to grab Mirkheim . And scoutboats have reported human ships on their way there . " The man , large , heavy-featured , thick-mustached , introduced himself as Sheldon Wyler . " Sure , I 'm working for the Baburites , " he said almost coolly . " What 's the Commonwealth or the League to me ? And no , do n't bother asking for details , because you wo n't get them . " He did , though , name his sullenly mute companion , Blyndwyr of the Vach Ruethen . " A fair number of Merseians are enlisted in the navy , " he volunteered . " Mostly they belong to the aristocratic party at home and have no love for the League , considering how it shunted their kind aside and dealt instead with the Gethfennu group . You know , not many League people seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself over the years . " After the newcomers had unsuited , he squeezed past Adzel to a phone set in the wall . When he had punched , the screen lit with the likeness of a Baburite . " They 're here , " he reported in Anglic , and went on to describe the three from Muddlin ' Through . " We 're about to show them their quarters . " " Have you examined their effects for weapons ? " asked the vocalizervoice.  | " Why , no . What good  --  Well , all right . Hold on . " To the prisoners : " You heard . We 've got to check your gear . " " Proceed , " Adzel said dully . " We are not so foolish as to use firearms inside an environmental unit ; so we have brought none . " Wyler laughed . " Blyndwyr and I are good enough shots to blast you without putting a hole anywhere else . " He went quickly through the luggage . The Merseian kept hand on gun butt . Chee 's whiskers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eyes had gone icegreen . A sickness gripped Falkayn by the throat . Having verified the bags contained nothing more dangerous than compact tool kits , Wyler blanked the phone and led the way down a corridor . A room opening on it held four bunks and a window rapidlyfilling with night . " Bath and cleanup yonder , " he pointed . " You can cook for yourselves ; the kitchen 's well stocked . Blyndwyr and me , we do n't live here just now , but you 'll be seeing a good deal of us , I 'll bet . Behave yourselves and you wo n't be hurt . That includes telling us whatever we want to know . " Adzel brought his forelimbs through the door and the room grew crowded . " Uh , I guess you 'd better sleep in the hall , fellow , " Wyler said . " Tell you what , we 'll go straight on to the mess , where there 's space for all of us , and talk . " Falkayn gripped his spirit as if it were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his neck ached from its own stiffness . Lead him on , he thought . Collect information , no matter how unlikely it is you 'll ever bring it to anybody who can use it . " What 's this building for ? " he got out in what he attempted to make a level tone . " Engineering teams used to need it , " Wyler said . " Later it housed officers of oxygen-breathing auxiliary forces while they got their in-doctrination . " " You speak too freely , " Blyndwyr reproved him . Wyler bit his lip . " Well , I did n't sign on to be a goddamn interrogator  --  " He relaxed a little . " What the muck , my answer was pretty obvious , was n't it ? And they are n't going anywhere with it , either . . .. Here we are . " The messroom was broad and echoing . Furniture had been stacked against the walls and the air smelled musty , as if no one had adjusted the recyclers for some time . Adzel went motionless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his feet , her tail whipping her flanks and the floor . Falkayn and Wyler drew out a couple of chairs and sat . Blyndwyr stood well aside , ever watchful . " Suppose you start by telling me exactly who sent you and why , " Wyler said . " You 've been goddamn vague so far . "  |p63Our  assignment itself was vague , Falkayn thought . Van Rijn trusted we 'd be able to improvise as we went , as we learned . Instead , we 've been captured as casually as fish in a net . And as hopelessly ? Aloud , he dared be defiant : " We might both be more interested in what you 're doing . How can you claim it 's not treason to your spe-cies ? " Wyler scowled . " Are you going to spout a sermon at me , Captain ? I do n't have to take that . " He considered . " But okay , okay , I will explain . What 's so evil about the Baburites ? Without a navy , they 'd never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole goddamn industrial revolution that Mirkheim means , with crumbs for anybody else . Or the League would . The Baburites think differently . To them , this is no question of profit or loss on a balance tape . No , it 's an opportunity for the race . With it , they can buy their way into the front rank  --  buy ships , mount expeditions , plant colonies , not to speak of all they might do at home  --  immediately ! " " But Mirkheim was not foreseeable , " Falkayn argued . " Before that , why was Babur arming ? Why did it plan to fight . . . and whom ? " " The Commonwealth has a navy , does n't it ? And the League companieskeep warships too . They 've seen use . We never know what we may come up against tomorrow . You of all people should remember the Shenna . Babur has a right of self-defense . " " You talk like a convert . " " You do not talk like a businessman , Captain Falkayn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're stalling me . And I 'm not going to stand for that , you hear ? Maybe you imagine being famous will protect you . Well , forget that . You 're a long ways off into a territory that does n't care a good goddamn about your reputation . They do n't feel obliged here to send you back undamaged , or send you back at all . If we have to , we 'll pump you full of babble juice . And if that does n't seem to be working so well , we 'll go on from there . " He stopped , swallowed , smoothed countenance and tone : " But hey , let 's not quarrel . I 'm sure you 're a reasonable osco . And you say one of your aims is to see what you can dicker out for your employer . Well , I might be able to help you there , if you help me first . Let 's brew some coffee and talk sense . " Chee Lan rattled a string of syllables . " What ? " Wyler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was making remarks about those refrigerated centipedes of yours that you would n't want to translatefor them . " Falkayn sat very quiet . His blood made a cataract noise in hisp64ears . Chee had used the Haijakatan language , which they three knew and surely no one else within many light-years . " If we do n't escape , we 'll die here sooner or later . And even what little we 've learned is important to bring home . I think we can take these two , and get Davy back to the ship in disguise . " " Her comments are , however , quite apposite , " the Wodenite put in . " I myself might go so far as to say  --  " He switched to Haijakatan . " If you can begin on the greenskin , Chee , I can handle the man . " " True and triple true . " The Cynthian did not pace , she bounded , back and forth like a cat at play but with her tail bottled to twice its normal size . Wyler 's hand slipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backed off , gripping his own blaster in its holster . Falkayn held himself altogether still , believing he saw what his comradesintended but not quite sure , ready only to trust them . Start by distracting attention . " You ca n't blame my friends for gettingexcited , " he said . " They 're not Commonwealth citizens . Neither am I. And we have n't come on behalf of the League , just of a single company . Nevertheless we 're to be interned indefinitely and quizzed under threats , possibly under drugs or torture . The best thing you can do , Wyler , is make the higher-ups of Babur listen to us . They should put away this blind hostility of theirs to the League . Its independent members want it to be in charge of Mirkheim . That 'd guarantee everybodyaccess to the supermetals . " " Would it ? " Wyler snorted . " The League 's split in pieces . And the Baburites know that . " " How ? When we 're as ignorant about them as we are , how did they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them ? And what makes them ready to stake their whole future on the word of those persons ? " " I do n't know everything , " Wyler admitted . " Goddamn , this planet 's got eight times the surface of Earth , most of it land surface . Why should n't the Imperial Band feel confident ? " He thrust out his jaw . " And that will be the last question you get to ask , Falkayn . I 'm starting now . " Chee 's restlessness had brought her near the Merseian . His alertness had focused itself back on the seated humans . Abruptly she made a final leap , sidewise but straight at him . Landing halfway up his belly , she gripped fast to his garment with her toes while both arms wrapped around his gun hand . He yelled and tried to draw regardless . She was too strong ; she clung . He hammered at her with his free fist . Her teeth raked blood from it.  |p65Adzel  had taken a single stride . It brought him in reach of Wyler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bowled backward across the floor . His tail slapped down over the man 's midriff to hold him pinioned . Meanwhile Adzel kept moving . He got to Blyndwyr , picked him up by the neck , shook him carefully , and set him down in a stunned condition . Chee hauled the blaster loose and scampered aside . Wyler was struggling to get at his gun . Falkayn arrived and took the weapon from its holster . Adzel released Wyler and stepped back with his comrades . Wyler lurched to his feet ; Blyndwyr sat gasping . " Are you crazy ? " the human chattered . " What is this nonsense , you can't -- can't --  " " Maybe we can . " Glee surged through Falkayn . He knew he should have been more cautious , vetoed the attack , stayed meek lest he get himself killed . But if none of us three is an Earthling , Goya is ; and on the whole , Earth has been good to us too . Besides , ours is Old Nick 's single ship in these parts . He sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to grope totally blind . And his welfare is also the welfare of thousands of his workers , millions among the planetary peoples who trade with him . . . . To Satan with that . What counts is breaking free ! The fire in his flesh roared too loudly for him to hear any fright . At the same time , the logical part of him was starkly conscious . " Stay where you are , both of you , " he told Wyler and Blyndwyr . " Adzel , Chee , your idea is that I can go out dressed as him , right ? " " Of course . " The Cynthian settled down on her haunches and began to groom herself . " One human must look like another to a Baburite . " Adzel cocked his head and rubbed his snout with a loud sandpaperingsound . " Perhaps not entirely . Freeman Wyler does have dark hair and a mustache . We must do something about that . " " Meanwhile , Wyler , off with your clothes , " Chee ordered . The Merseian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She swung the blaster in his direction . " You stay put , " she said in his native Eriau . " Pm not a bad marksman either . " Bloodless in the cheeks , Wyler cried , " You 're on collision orbit , I tell you , you ca n't get away , you 'll die for goddamn nothing ! " " Undress , I told you , " Chee replied . " Or must Adzel do it ? " Looking at the muzzle of her weapon and the implacable eyes behind , Wyler started to remove his garments . " Falkayn , have n't you any sense ? " he pleaded . The response he got was a thoughtful " Yes . I 'm planning how we can take you along to quiz . "  |p66Chee  lifted her ears . " We , ' Davy ? " she asked . " How are Adzel and I going to get out ? No , you can ransom us later . " " You two most certainly are coming , " Falkayn said . " We do n't know how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " But  --  " " Besides , I 'll need your help with Wyler , not to mention after we 're spaceborne . " Adzel returned from the kitchen where he had been rummaging . " Here is the means to provide you with dark hair and mustache , " he announced proudly . " A container of chocolate sauce . " It did n't seem like what a really dashing hero would use in a jailbreak , but it would have to do . While he stripped , put on Wyler 's garb , and submitted to the anointing , Falkayn exchanged rapid-paced words with his companions . A scheme evolved , not much more precariousthan the one which had gotten them this far . Adzel ripped up Blyndwyr 's clothes and tied him securely in place . He and Chee kept Wyler unbound , naked , under guard of her firearm . The Wodenite uttered a benediction , all the goodbye that Falkayn took time for . They three might never fare together again , he might never come back to Coya and Juanita , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The hallway clattered to his footfalls . At the airlock , he punched the number he had seen and stood feeling as if he waited to be shot at in a duel . When the Baburite 's four eyes peered out of the screen at him , he could n't help passing his tongue over dry lips . A sweet taste reminded him of how crude his disguise was . He spoke without preliminary , as Wyler had done before : " The prisoners seem to have lost morale . They asked me to fetch some medicines and comforts for them from their ship . I think that may make them cooperative . " He was gambling that human psychology would be as little known here as human bodies were . A heartbeat and a heartbeat went by before the creature answered : " Very well . The guards will be told to expect you . " Blankness . Falkayn found Wyler 's spacesuit and its undergarment in a locker . The suit was distinctively painted ; probably every offplanet employee had an individual pattern for identification purposes . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He could have used help , but did n't dare have anyone else in scanner range of the phone , lest the Baburite call him back.  |p67Cycling  through the lock , he emerged into bulldog jaws of gravitation . The field stretched bare before him , pockmarked with hatch covers . Here and there a caterpillar shape crossed it on some unguessableerrand . Blue-white lights glared along the fronts of buildings till their ice shimmered like cold made visible . A wind whined and thrust . In darkness overhead , two moons shone dimly , but no stars . The walk was long to his destination . It seemed impossible that no one challenged him while he opened the silo , stepped onto the elevator , and descended . By the time he had reached the personnel entrance of his ship , his helmet was chokefulof sweat-reek , he could barely whistle the countersign , and superstitionrose from the grave of his childhood to croak , This ca n't go on . You 're overdue for bad luck . We 've already had it , he defended . We came too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think if it were still here , you would have been this lightly guarded ? The valve turned . Waiting in the chamber for air exchange , Falkayninvoked some of Adzel 's Buddhist techniques and regained a measure of calm . " There should be no bow , no arrow , no archer : only the firing . " He left his space armor on inside , though frost was instantly white upon it . A flick of a switch in the heater controls cleared his faceplate , and he hurried to the bridge . Working his awkward bulk into his shockseat , he said via radio , " Muddlehead , we have to break Adzel and Chee loose . I 'll steer , because you have n't seen where they are . We 'll land in front of an entry lock . Blast it instantly  --  they wo n't have time to go through in the regular way  --  and have the outer valve of the number-two belly entrance open for them . The moment they 're aboard , lift for space , taking such evasive maneuvers as your instrumentssuggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're far enough out , and I mean as soon ; forget about safety margins . Is this clear ? " " As clear as usual , " said the computer . The power plant came to full , murmurous life . Negafield generatorsthrust against that fabric of physical relationships which we call space . The ship glided upward . " Yonder ! " Falkayn yelled uselessly . Dancing over the manual pilot console , his fingers were handicapped by their gloves . But if the hull should be seriously holed by an enemy shot , an unprotected oxygen breather would be dead . Air roared outside . He had left the accelerationcompensator off , in order that he might have that extra sensoryp68input for this tricky task , and forces yanked at him , threw him against the safety web and then back into the seat . Hai-ah ! The building was straight ahead . He dropped , he hovered . A gun in its turret flung forth a shaped-charge shell . Flame erupted , the outer portal crumpled in wreckage . With surgical delicacy , an energy cannon sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white hot and flowed . The caterpillar figures dashed about on the field . Had they no ground defenses ? Well , who could have anticipated this kind of attack ? Wait  --  above  --  forms in the moonglow , suddenly diving , air-craftThebarrier went down . A frost-cloud boiled as Baburite and Terrestrialgases met . Falkayn was fleetingly glad that automatic doors would close off the module where Blyndwyr lay . Doubly gigantic in his spacesuit , Adze stormed forth . Was he carrying Chee and Wyler ? A firebolt spat from above . The spaceship swung her cannon about and threw lightning back . Adzel was out of sight , below the curve of the hull . What had happened , in God 's name , what had happened ? " They are aboard , " Muddlehead reported , and sent the vessel leaping . Acceleration jammed Falkayn deep into his chair . " Compensators , " he ordered hoarsely . A steady one gee underfoot returned . Split atmosphere raved and the first stars came in sight . Falkayn unlocked his faceplate and reached shakily for the intercom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called . A shell exploded close by , flash of light , buffet of noise , trembling of deck . Muddlin ' Through drove on outward . Adzel 's tones rumbled through the fury round about . " Essentially we are well , Chee and I. Unfortunately , a shot from an aircraft struck our prisoner , who was under my right arm , penetrated his suit , and killed him instantly . I left the body behind . " There 's our bad luck , raged within Falkayn . I would 've put him under narco and maybe learned  --  Damn , oh , damn ! " My own suit was damaged , but not too badly for the self-sealing to work , and I suffered no more than a scorched scale , " Adzel went on . " Chee was safe on my left side . . . . I would like to say a prayer for Sheldon Wyler . " Steadiness took over in Falkayn . " Later . First we 've got to escape . We 've surprise and speed on our side , but the alarm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you two . " He knew as well as they that in a close encounter with any fighter heavier than a corvette , they were done for . They might ward off mis/siles for a time ; but so would the enemy , and meanwhile its energy beams , powered by generators more massive than Muddlin ' Through could carry , would gnaw through plating much thinner than its own . The chance of combat was small , however . Probably no Baburite had such a position and velocity at this moment that its gray drive was capable of equalizing vectors , at the same point in space , with the furiously accelerating Solar craft . Nearly all slug-it-out contests took place because opponents had deliberately sought each other . Target-seeking torpedoes , whose mass was small enough to permit enormous changes in speed and direction , were something else . So were rays that traveled at the speed of light . The sky of Babur had fallen well aft , the globe was still huge in heaven but dwindling . Stars burned manyfold , some among them the color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Muddlehead ? " Falkayn asked . It should n't be long . They were already high in the gravity well of Mogul and climbing upward fast in Babur 's . Soon the metric of space would be too flat to interfere unduly with fine-tuned oscillators ; and once they were moving at their top faster-than-light pseudovelocity , practically nothing ever built had legs to match theirs . " One-point-one-six-hour , given our present vector , " said the computer . " But I propose to add several minutes to that time by applying transverse thrust to bring us near the satellite called Ayisha . My instrumentsshow a possible anomalous radiation pattern there . " Falkayn hesitated a second . If heavy ground installations were on the moon . . . Decision : " Very well . Carry on . " Time crawled . Twice Chee yelled savagely , when her guns destroyeda missile on its intercept course . Falkayn could only sit and think . Mostly he remembered , in jumbled oddments  --  wingsailing with Coya at Lunograd , a red sun forever above a desert on Ikrananka , his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drop newborn Juanita when she was laid in his arms , The Flyting of Dunbarand Kennedie , his first night with Coya and his last , youthful beer hall arguments about God and girls , Rodin 's Burghers of Calais , a double moonglade on the Auroral Ocean , a firef all between two stars , Coya beside him beholding the crooked towers of a city on a planet which did not yet have a human-bestowed name , his mother using a prism to show him what made the rainbow , Coya and he laughing like children as they had a snowball fight at an Antarctic resort , the splendor of an Ythrian on the wing , Coya bringing him sandwiches and coffee when he sat far into a nightwatch studying the data readoutson a new world the ship was circling , Coya  --   |p70The  scarred moon-disc grew big in the viewscreen . Falkayn magnified , searched , suddenly found it : a sprawling complex of domes , turrets , ship housings , spacefield , test stands . . . . " Record ! " he ordered automatically . Did Muddlehead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signs are of beings thermodynamically similar to or identical with hu-mans . " " You mean that stuff 's not meant for Baburites ? Why , then  --  " " A-yu ! " Chee Lan screamed ; and incandescence flared momentarily . " Close , friends , close ! " " I suggest we do not dawdle , " Adzel said . The colony , or whatever it was , reeled out of sight behind a mountainrange as the ship sped past Ayisha . " According to my instruments , " Muddlehead reported , " if we persevere as at present , surroundingconditions will grow progressively less unsalubrious for us . " That means we 're going to get away , Falkayn thought . We 're clear . The pains and tingles of tension spread upward through his body to the brain . " Where are we bound , then ? " he heard Chee ask . He forced himself to say , " Mirkheim . We just might arrive ahead of the Baburites , in time to warn those approaching humans , whoever they are , and the workers there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replied . " The enemy probably has too big a jump on us . And should we take the risk ? Is n't it more important to bring home the information we 've collected , that somehow Babur 's acquired a substantial corps of military and technical oxygen breathers ? A courier torp might not get through . " " No , we must attempt to warn , " Adzel said . " It could forestall a battle . One violent death is too much . " Falkayn nodded wearily . His gaze sought back to the uncaring stars . Poor Wyler , he thought . Poor everybody . An intercom presented the captain of Alpha Cygni . " Madame , " he said , " Navigation reports we are one light-year from destination . "  | " Oh  --  " Sandra gathered in her wits . So soon ? Then how had the trip from Hermes taken so long ? A light-year , raced through her . The extreme distance at which the space-pulses from our hyperdrives are detectable . Instantaneously . Now they 'll know at the planet that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemy . " Order all units to prepare for action . " " Yellow alert throughout . Aye , madame . " The image disappeared . Sandra stared about her . Save where viewscreens showed heaven , the admiral 's bridge was a narrow and cheerless cave . It throbbed slightly with engine beat ; the air blew warm , smelling faintly of oil and chemicals . Abruptly it felt unreal , her naval uniform a costume , the whole proceeding a ridiculous piece of playacting . Clad in a similar two-toned coverall , which could at need be the underpadding in a spacesuit , Eric gave her a wry look . " Buck fever ? " he murmured . " Me too . " He could speak candidly , since he was the only other person there . " I suppose that 's what it is . " Sandra tried to shape a smile and failed . " I 'm surprised . When you 're one of the few people along who have any combat experience . " " Diomedes was n't like this . That was hand-to-hand warfare . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to issue commands . " Why did n't I hire mercenaries , years ago , to form the nucleus of a proper-sized officer corps ? Because it did n't seem that the peace we had always known on Hermes would ever be threatened . Brushfire clashes happened around stars too far off j for us to really notice : nothing worse . We were warned of aliens getting into space ; but surely they were not too dangerous  --  not even the Shenna , whom , after all , the League put down before any great harm was done . Double and triple surely , Technic civilization would never know wars among its own member peoples . That was something man had left behind him , like purdah , tyranny , and cannibalism . We kept a few warcraft with minimum crews to act as a police and rescue corps , and as insurance against a contingency we did n't really believe was possible . ( Inadequate insurance , I see today . ) Their practice with heavy weapons we considered rather a joke , except when taxpayer organizations complained . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blurted . " You should have stayed behind , in charge of the reserves  --  " " We 've been over that ground often enough , think you not , Mother ? " Eric answered . " No better man than Mike Falkayn couldp72be holding the reins there . What I wish is that I 'd had sense to ask for an assignment that 'd hold me busy here . Being your executive officer sounded big , but it turns out to be sheer comic opera . " " Well , I 'm scant more than a passenger myself till we start negotiating . Pray God I can do that . In history , comic operas have had a way of turning into tragedies . " If only Nadi were along . His company quiets me . But she had sent the chief of the Supermetals patrol on ahead , to ready the entire outfit for cooperation with hers . About three hours till arrival , at their top pseudospeed . . . She drew several deep breaths . Never mind about a battle . If that came , let her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the skipper of this flagship the coordinator , as had been agreed at the outset . Their purposethen would almost certainly be just to fight free and escape . They had no great strength . Besides Alpha Cygni , a light battleship , it was two cruisers , four destroyers , and a carrier for ten Meteor-class pursuers . At that , they had not left much behind to guard their home . Her job was to prevent a clash , to establish Hermes as an impartial agent intervening to see justice done and order restored . And she did know something about handling people . She settled into her shockseat , lit a cigar , and began consciously relaxing , muscle by muscle . Eric paced . " Madame ! " The words came harsh and not quite even . " Hyperdrivesdetected . " Sandra made herself remain seated . " Coming to meet us ? " " No , madame . They 're in our fourth quadrant . As near as can be extrapolated , we and they have the same destination . " She twisted her head about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held the sun of Mirkheim . They would have to come almost on top of that dim remnant to see it . The fourth quadrant  --  She could not identify what she sought there . It was only a small spark at its remove , lost among thousands . But in the fourth quadrantlay Mogul . Eric smacked fist into palm . " The Baburites ! " " A moment , please , sir , " said the captain . " I 'm getting a preliminarydata analysis . . . . ' T is a huge force . No details computable yet ; but in numbers , at least , ' t is overwhelming . " For a moment Sandra gulped nausea , as if she had been kicked in the gut . Then her mind went into emergency operation . Self-doubt fell away . Decisions snapped forth . " This changes things , " she said . " Best we try for a parley . From this ship , since I 'm aboard her.  |p73Pre|pare  an intercept course for us . The rest of ours  --  they can reach Mirkheim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good . Let them continue yonways under leadership of Achilles , rendezvous with Nadi , and hold themselves combat ready . But in case of doubt  --  ' fore all , if something appears to have happened to us on Alpha  --  they are to return home at once . " " Aye , madame . " In a corner of herself , Sandra felt sorry for the captain . He was a young man , really , striving to be cool and efficient in the face of ruin . He repeated her instructions and his image vanished . " Oh , no , " Eric groaned . " What can we do ? " " Very little , I 'm afraid , " Sandra admitted . " Let me be , please . I have to think . " She leaned back and closed her eyes . An hour passed . From time to time , relayed information hauled her mind briefly out of the circle around which it struggled . The Baburites were holding course at moderate pseudospeed . Their complacencywas almost an insult . Finally one ship left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A while later , signals began to go back and forth , modulations imposed on hyperdrive oscillations : We wish to communicate  --  We will communicate . The calls were stereotyped , an on-off code , the rate of conveyance of meaning tormentingly slow : for the uncertainty principle is quick to make chaos of space-pulses . Not until vessels are within a few thousand kilometersof each other is there enough coherence for voice transmission . Pictures require more proximity than that . Which is why we ca n't send messages directly between the stars , crossed Sandra 's head , relic of a lesson in physics when she was young . Nobody could position that many relay stations . Nor would they stay positioned . So we must use couriers , and hell can come to a boil someplace before we know aught has gone wrong . Instruments accumulated ever better data , computers analyzed , until it was clear that the strange craft was approximately the size of Alpha , surely as well armed . At last the captain 's face reappeared . He was pale . " Madame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . goes . .. quote , You will come no nearer , but will match hypervelocity to ours and stand by for orders . ' Close quote . That 's how it goes . " Eric reddened . Sandra peeled lips back from teeth and said , " We 'll go along . However , phrase your acknowledgment , hm , We will do as you request . ' " Thank you , Your Grace ! " The captain 's whole being registeredp74an appreciation that should spread through the crew . . . though doubtless the Anglic nuance would quite go by the Baburites . Still the viewscreens held only stars . Sandra could imagine the foreignship , a spheroid like hers , never meant to land on a planet , studdedwith gun emplacements , missile launchers , energy projectors , armoredin forcefields and steel , magazines bearing the death of half a continent . She would not see it in reality . Even if they fought , she probably never would . The flesh aboard it and the flesh aboard Alpha would not touch , would not witness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wounded . The abstractness was nightmarish . Peter Asmundsen , Nicholas van Rijn , she herself had ever been in the middle of their own doings : a danger dared , a blow struck or taken , a word spoken , a hand clasped , all in the living presence of the doers . Is our time past ? Is the whole wild , happy age of the pioneers ? Are we today crossing the threshold of the future ? Preliminaries must have taken place before the captain announced , " Lady Sandra Tamarin-Asmundsen , Grand Duchess of Hennes ; the delegate of the Imperial Siseman Naval Command . " The sound of the vocalizer was emotionless and blurred by irregularitiesin the carrier wave . Yet did a roughness come through ? " Greeting , Grand Duchess . Why are you here ? " She dismissed her despair and cast back , " Greeting , Admiral , or whatever you want to be called . We 're naturally curious about your purpose , too . You 're no nearer home than we are . " " Our mission is to take possession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A part of her wished that the ships were close enough together for picture transmission . Somehow it would have helped to look into four little eyes in an unhuman visage . It would have felt less like contendingwith a ghost . But the determination is as solid as yonder invisible sun , she thought , and so are the weapons which back it . She said with care , " Is't not obvious why we Hermetians have come ? Our objective is simply to .. . to take charge , to act as caretakers , while a settlement is worked out . Being neither Commonwealth nor Babur nor League , we hoped we could make all sides stay their hands , think twice , and avoid a war . Admiral , ' t is not too late for that . " " It is , " said the artificial voice . When it added its stunning news , was there the least hint of sardonicism ? " We do not refer to the fact that the Imperial Band does not desire your interference , but to the fact , established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fleet at Mirkheim . We are coming to oust it . Hermetians will be well advised to withdraw before combat begins . " " Son of a bitch  --  " she heard Eric gasp , and herself whisper , " MercifulJesus ! " " Rejoin your flotilla and take it home , " said the Baburite . " Once action has commenced , we will attack every human vessel we en-counter . " " No , wait , wait ! " Sandra cried , half rising . No response came . After a minute her captain told her : " The alien is moving off , madame , back toward its companion units . " " Battle stations , " Sandra directed . " Full speed on a course to interceptours . " Stars streamed across viewscreens as Alpha swung about . The pulse of the engines strengthened . " Was that crawler lying ? " Eric roared . As if in reply , the captain described readings , numerous hyperdrivesactivated in the neighborhood of the planet . Obviously somebody was present who had now detected the newest invaders . Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Curse the cosmos , what a kloodge of amateurs we are . " Pain stretched Eric 's mouth wide as he spoke . " The Baburites kept watch on Mirkheim . They knew when the Earthlings arrived . We , we plowed ahead like a bull with a fever . " " No , remember , we relied on Nadi 's patrol to come give us warningof aught untoward , " Sandra reminded him mechanically . " No doubt the Earthlings captured them  --  he had nothing particularly fast or powerful  --  captured them with some idea of preserving surprise . But meanwhile the Baburites had high-speed observers in the vicinity . " She grimaced . " It seems the worst amateurs are in the CommonwealthAdmiralty . " They 've never had to fight a war . Skills , doctrine , the military style of thinking evaporated generations ago . Such things must needs be relearned in the time that is upon us . Tidings continued to arrive . The fleet ahead was leaving Mirkheim , deploying in what looked like combat formation . It was considerably inferior to the armada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut and run . But no doubt its commander had his orders from the politicians back home : " Do n't give up easily . We 're sure those bugs will just attempt a bluff . They ca n't be serious about fighting us . " They sure can be , Sandra thought . They are . Eric stopped in his tracks . It was as if a flame kindled in him ,  |p76though  he spoke low . " Mother . . . Mother , if we joined the Cornmonwealthers  --  ourfellow humans , after all  --  " She shook her head . " Not . ' T would make slim difference , save to get Hermetians killed and ships wrecked that we 'll want for home defense . I 'm about to tell all other units of ours to sheer off and start back immediately . " He divined her intention . " We , though ? Alpha Cygni ? " " We 'll continue to Mirkheim . Belike the whole Solar strength will be gone by the time we get there , off to meet the Baburites . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anybody to tangle with casually . We do have a duty to help Nadi 's folk get free if possible . They 're our allies , after a fashion . Including technicians on the ground . " Sandra achieved a smile of sorts . " And since the news first broke about it , I 've been curious to see Mirkheim . " No guard was at the planet . The Supermetals patrol vessels orbited empty . A quick radio exchange confirmed that their crews had been ferried down to the mining base , as deep an oubliette as ever was . The battleship took a circling station of her own . Boats sprang from her sides to evacuate the personnel below . Sandra left a protesting Eric behind , nominally in charge , and herself rode in one of the auxiliaries . Mirkheim loomed monstrous ahead . The wanly glowing ashes of its sun were unseeable at its distance , and it might almost have been a rogue world which had never belonged to any star , drifting eternallyamong winter-bright constellations . Almost , not quite . No snows of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gleam was of metal , hard , in places nearly mirrorlike . Mountains and chasms made rough shadows . Regions of dark iron sketched a troll 's face . Soon the boat neared the surface and leveled off . Behind Sandra stretched a plain , on and on to a horizon so far off that a dread of being alone in limitless emptiness awoke in the soul of the onlooker . The ground was not cratered and dust-covered like that of a normal airless body ; it was blank , dimly shining , here and there corrugated in fantastic ridges where moltenness had congealed . Its darkness cut sharply across the Milky Way . To right and left , the plain was pocked by digging . Incredibly  --  no , understandably  --  work went on ; a robot tractor was hauling a train of ore cars . Ahead bulked a scarp , upthrown by some ancient convulsion through the crust of metals left by the supernova , a black wall beneath which the domes and cubesp77and towers of the compound huddled as if crushed , on whose heights a radio mast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tilted and appeared to leap upward as the boat descended . Landing jacks made a contact that vibrated through hull and crew . Engine purr died away . Silence pressed inward . Sandra broke it . " I 'm bound out , " she said , leaving her seat . " Madame ? " her pilot protested . " But the drag 's more than five gees ! " " I 'm reasonably strong . " " We  --  you know , you ordered yourself  --  we 'll simply take them directly aboard and scramble . " " I doubt not we 'll hit complications even in that . I want to be on the spot to help cope , not at the end of a phone beam . " And I can hardly say it aloud , but I feel a need to . . . to experience , however briefly , this thing for which so many sacrifices have been made , for which so much blood may soon be spilled . I need for Mirkheim to become real to me . A pair of crewmen accompanied her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flanking her when she cycled through the airlock and stepped forth . That was well . Caught by the gravitationas she left the boat 's interior field , she would have crashed to a bone-breaking fall had the men not supported her . The three of them hastily activated their impellers to hold them up , as if suspended in a harness . That let them shuffle forward across the steely soil , forcing leaden ribs to draw air in and out of them , staring past sagging lids with eyeballs whose weight sent blurs and blotches floating across vision . Unseen , unfelt , radioactive emanation sleeted through them , enough to kill in a matter of weeks . And workers have been coming here for eighteen years , Sandra remembered . Do I love my own kind that much ? They were emerging from a dome . Despite their variegated suits , she recognized their races from past contact or from reading and pictures . Nadi the Wodenite led them , of course . Near him came two raven-featured Ikranankans , a four-armed shaggy-headed Gorzuni , a leonine Ivanhoan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ societies less advanced than the spacefaring one , which had shown no desire to help them progress ) , and four humans ( from colony planets where existence could become much easier if an adequatecapital investment be made ; but Technic capital was attracted to more lucrative things ) . In the middle of barrenness , they were like grotesque symbols of life ; Vigeland might have sculptured them.  |p78It  was not surprising that they were so few . Environment made short the periods during which any sophont could work here , and forced him to stay mostly indoors . Flesh and blood were present chiefly to perform certain maintenance and communication tasks , and to make decisions which were not routine . Otherwise , machines dwelt on Mirkheim . They prospected , mined , transported , refined , loaded , did the brute labor and most of the delicate . Some were slaved to others which had self-programming computers , while the central computer at the base was of consciousness level . The entire operation was a miracle of technological ingenuity  --  and still more , Sandra thought , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toiled ahead of the rest . The visage behind the vitryl of his helmet was battered and worn . " My lady from Hermes ? " he began in accented Anglic . " I 'm Henry Kittredge from Vixen , superintendent of this particular gang . " " I 'm . . . happy to meet you . . . . " she replied between breaths . His smile was bleak . " I du n no ' bout that , lady . These are n't exactlyhappy circumstances , are they ? But , uh , I do want to say how grateful we are . We 've already overstayed our time , should 've been relieved many days ago . If we 'd had to stay much longer , working outdoorsas often as usual , we'd 've gotten a dangerous dosage . After a while , we'd 've died . " " Could n't you have kept indoors ? " " Maybe the Earthlings would 've let us . I doubt the Baburites would . Why should they care ? And we'd 've been wanted to show them how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an effort to pull her head back up again . " You 've had years of accumulated experience , sometimes at the cost of lives , not ? " she said . " That 's a good strategic reason for evacuating you . Without your help , anybody else will be a long , expensivetime about resuming exploitation . You  --  you and your coworkers , wherever they live , you might just prove to be a valuable bargaining counter . " " Yes , we 've talked about that ' mong ourselves . Listen . " Eagerness awoke in the tired voice . " Let 's take some of the key equipment with us . Or if you do n't want to delay that long , let 's sabotage it . Huh ? " Sandra hesitated . She had n't considered that possibility , and now the choice was thrust upon her . Dared she linger for extra hours ? She did . The fleets would not likely end their strife soon . " We 'll remove the stuff , " she said , and wondered if she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late . " The words seemed to hang for a moment in the murmurous quiet of the bridge . Any of three , Adzel , Chee Lan , David Falkayn , might have spoken them , out of shared pain and anger . All of three stared emptily forth into darkness and uncaring suns . There fire had blossomed , tiny at its remove but still a dreadful glory . Another spark winked , and another . Nuclear warheads were explodingthroughout the space near Mirkheim . Chee reached for the hyperwave receiver controls . As she turned them past different settings , the speaker buzzed , chattered , crackled , gobbled : coded messages from ship to ship , across distances that light would take hours to bridge . The frontrunners of either fleet had begun engagement  --  gone into normal state , moving at true speeds of kilometers per second and true accelerations of a few gravities , reaching for each other with missiles , energy beams , shells , Meteor boats . Adzel studied instruments , held a soft colloquy with Muddlehead , and announced : " The battle can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observe more traces of fusion bursts , more complicated neutrinopatterns left by engines , than we do . We have missed a beforehandarrival by an ironically small margin . " " I wonder if our warning would have made much difference , " Falkayn sighed . " Judging by these data "  --  he swept his hand across a row of meters  --  " the Commonwealth fleet came first , defied the Baburitesin hopes they 'd back down , found that was n't the case , and will be fighting for bare survival . " " Why does n't it simply flee ? " Falkayn shrugged , as if the fact were not gall in his throat . " Orders , no doubt  --  to inflict maximum damage if combat should erupt  --  orders issued by politicians safe at home , who 've always held the theory and practice of war is too wicked a subject for civilized men to study . " Fighting could go on for days before the Commonwealth admiral decides he must retreat , he thought . Ships will accelerate , decelerate , orbit freely over millions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an orgasm of violence , then both of them drawn apart by their velocities till they can come about for a new encounter , probably each with a new foe . " We had to try , of course , " he went on dully . " The question is what we try next . " They had ransacked their minds for plans , contingency after contingency , while Muddlin ' Through sped from Babur toward Mirkheim . " Not contact , " Adzel said . They might rendezvous with a Solar vessel and , through her , get in touch with the admiral . But they had nothing left to offer him , and the risk involved was considerable . " Hang around ? " Chee asked  --  wait with power systems throttled down , nearly undetectable , on the fringes of war , till they had seen what happened . But surely survivors would bring that news to Earth . Yet it was no longer certain , as it once had been , that the Commonwealthgovernment would be frank with the people ; and van Rijn needed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would receive the dispatch they had sent him in a courier torpedo after their escape . When the thing entered the Solar System and broadcast its signal , the Space Service that retrieved it might not forward the written contents . Falkayn doubted the cipher could be broken in reasonable time ; still , van Rijn would remain in the dark . Thus the safety of this crew was a prime criterion  --  not to speak of Coya , Juanita , and the child unborn . Nevertheless , here sentient beings were dead , dying , mutilated , in mortal peril ; and the horror would go on . To skulk in the deeps before slinking home had a foul taste . And  --  " We have n't accomplished such an everlovin ' lot so far , have we ? " Falkayn muttered . " Blundered into captivity and out again , getting a man killed in the process . " " Do not feel guilty about that , Davy , " Adzel counseled . " It was tragic , true , but Wyler was collaborating with the enemy . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white on the human'sfists . " You both ought to discipline those consciences of yours , " Chee said . " They squeam at you too much . " Her carnivore instincts awakened , she bounded onto the console and stood white against blackness , stars , the distant firebursts where ships perished . " We can do active , not passive intelligence collection , " she declared eagerly . " Why are we dithering ? Let 's make for Mirkheim . " " Is there any point in our landing ? " Adzel replied . They had talked about the rescue of Supermetals personnel stranded on thep81planet ; but they could only take a few without overloading their life support system . " Probably not , " Chee said . " However , that course will bring us near the thick of action . Who knows what might turn up ? Come on ! " Inward bound , they received a laser-borne message . That meant it was directed specifically at them ; they had been detected . The code was Commonwealth . Falkayn knew this from having compared different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the meaning was plain : Identify yourself or we attack . Muddlehead reeled off data analysis . The other craft was most likely a Continent-class destroyer . Her position , velocity , and accelerationwere more definite . She could not draw near enough on this pass ever to show to the unaided eye as a black blade drawn over the Milky Way . But her weapons could span the gap . And both were too close to the dead sun to enter hyperdrive . " Evade , " Falkayn ordered . He sent back a voice transmission in Anglic : " We are not your enemy , we happen to he here from Earth . " A minute later , Muddlehead reported a missile launched toward him . He was not surprised . The men in yonder hull must be dazed with weariness and strangled terror , stress had worn them down till they were nothing but duty machines , and if he failed to reply in code then he must be a Baburite attempting a ruse . At such a distance , a ray would be too attenuated to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not carry a forcefield generator sufficiently strong to ward off a hard-driven warhead . Nor , despite her low mass , should she have the potential of running from a killer that homed on her engine output . But Muddlin ' Through had power for twice her size and spent none of it on energy screens . The heavens wheeled crazily around Falkayn 's head as her computer sent her through an arc that would have torn the guts out of an ordinary vessel . Sliding clear of the torpedo , she opened fire on it . It blew apart in a rain of flames and incandescentgobbets . She swung about again and resumed her original course . The Terrestrial ship receded without making a second assault . Briefly before Falkayn stood the idea of a man aboard that destroyer . He came from  --  where ?  --  Japan , say , and always in him dwelt a memory of those beautiful islands , old high-curved roofs , cherry trees in bloom under the pure steeps of Fuji , a garden where gardener and bonsai worked together through a lifetime 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth with a certain girl at his side.  |p82This  day he sat webbed in place before the idiot faces of instruments while engines droned through his bones ; thirst thickened his tongue , he had sweated too much in his tension , his garments stank , salt stung his eyes and lay bitter on his lips . Hour crept by hour , the waiting , the waiting , the waiting , until reality shrank to this and home was a half-forgotten fever dream : then alarms yammered , creatures that he had never seen even in his nightmares were somewhere on the far side of a bulkhead , or so the instruments said , and he ordered the launch parameters computed for a missile , sent it forth , sat waiting once more to know if he had slain or they would slay him , hoped wildly that his death would be quick and clean , not a shrieking with his skin seared off and his eyeballs melted , and perhaps through him there flitted a wondering whether those monsters he fired at also remembered a beautiful home . Where had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intercom pickup : " We seem to 've gone free this time . " The incident would have sent most crews scuttling immediately towardsafety . Instead , it hatched a goblin of an idea in Chee . Adzel heard her out , pondered , and agreed the possible gain was worth the hazard . Falkayn argued for a while , then assented , the part of him that was Coya 's husband outvoted by a part he had imagined lay buried with his youth . Not that they had any chance to pull off a swift , gleeful exploit . Time drained away while the ship moved cautiously about , detectors straining , Muddlehead sifting and discarding . Falkayn puffed on his pipe till his raw tongue could not taste the food he made himself swallow . Chee worked on a statuette , attacking the clay as if it threatenedher life . Adzel meditated and slept . Endlessness finally had an end . " A Solar vessel has demolished a Baburite , " the computer announced , and recited coordinates . Falkayn jerked out of half a doze where he sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his feet . " The characteristic flash of a detonation has been followed by a cessation of neutrino emission from one of two sources . The other source is departing , and would be unable to return at any available acceleration for a period of more than a standard day . " " Not that she 'll want to  --  " " We can lie alongside the wreck in a period I calculate to be threepoint-sevenhours plus or minus approximately forty minutes . "  |p83It  thrilled in Falkayn . " And I suppose we 've a fifty-fifty chance she 'll be Baburite . " " No , that is positive . I have conducted statistical studies of emissionpatterns from thermonuclear reactors in both fleets . This ship that was defeated showed a distinctly Baburite spectrum . " Falkayn nodded . Fusion engines built to operate under subjovian conditions would not radiate quite like those which worked for oxygenbreathers . He 'd been aware of that , but had not been aware enough data would come in to make the mathematics reliable . " Bully for you , Muddlehead , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of initiative you show . " " I have also invented three new wild card games , " the computer told him . . . hopefully ? " Never mind , " Chee snapped . " You make for that cockering wreck ! " Drive pulses intensified . " We fared more happily the first time we cruised this part of space , " Adzel mused . " But then , we were younger , eighteen Earth-years ago . " Was he being tactful ? The span was not so great a part of his life expectancy as it was of a human 's or a Cynthian 's . " We were proud , " Falkayn said . " Our discovery , that was going to give a dozen races the chance they needed . Now  --  " His voice died away . Adzel laid a hand on his shoulder . He must consciously stiffen himself against the gee-field to support such a weight . " Feel no blame that this is being fought over , Davy , " the Wodenite urged . " What we gave was good . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret could n't last , " Chee added . " It was sheer luck that the first person to repeat our reasoning was Old Nick , and we could talk him into keeping quiet . Sooner or later , a nasty scramblewas bound to happen . " " Sure , sure , " Falkayn answered . " But war  --  I 'd thought civilization had evolved beyond war . " " The Shenna had n't , the Baburites have n't , " Chee snorted . " You need n't accuse the Technic societies because outsiders have bad manners . That notion of symmetrical sinfulness is a strange tendency in your species . " " Somehow I ca n't see the cases as being parallel , " Falkayn argued . " Damnation , it made a contorted kind of sense for the Shenna to plot an assault on us . But the Baburites  --  why should they arm as they did , never foreseeing a Mirkheim to fight over ? And why should they everp84fight , anyway ? If they could buy the tools and technology they needed to build the kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the supermetals they 'd require for a fraction of the cost . I have this gnawing notion that something in us , in Technic culture , is respon-sible . " " Wyler might have given us a hint or three if he 'd lived . I wish you 'd stop moping about him , Davy . He was n't a nice man . " " Who can afford to be , these days ? . . . Oh , to hell with this . " Falkayn flung himself back into his chair . " Agreed . To hell by express . Me , I 'm going to do some more modeling . " Chee left the bridge . " Perhaps I , at least , could play cards with you , Muddl.ehead , if you want diversion , " Adzel offered . " We have little else to occupy us until we arrive . " Except sit and wish nothing we ca n't handle will home on us , Falkayn thought. "  --  Fear and trembling Hope , Silence and Foresight ; Death the SkeletonAnd Time the Shadow . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of impeller thrust and drifted across a hundred meters of void between his own craft and the ruin . Stars and stillness enfolded him . Here he saw no trace of the battle ; all that agony was lost in the hollow reaches of space , save for a twisted shape that tumbled before him among lesser metal shards . He dared not think how many lives were gone  --  surely Baburites rejoiced to see their sun , even as he did his  --  but bent his attention wholly , dryly to the task ahead . The ship had been more or less cruiser size . A missile had gotten past her defenses and shattered her . Without a surrounding atmosphere , concussion had been insufficient to blow her entirely to fragments . Survivors , if any , had found an undamaged lifeboat , in a sectionbuilt to break away upon impact , and fled . The largest remnant of the hull was bigger than Muddlin ' Through and ought to contain plenty of apparatus , not too badly damaged for study . A gauge on his wrist told him that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard the thud as his bootsoles touched plates and gripped fast . Chee poised nearby ; Adzel was a gigantic silhouette fartheroff against heaven . " You two stay put while I take a look around , " he directed them , and plodded off . It felt a little like walkingupside down , for he was weightless and the dead vessel wasp85slowly spinning . Constellations streamed by , blacknesses flickered around the shapes of turrets and housings . His breath sounded loud in his ears . When he reached an edge where the hull had been torn apart , he picked his way cautiously through a tangle of projecting , knotted girders . A body was caught between two of them . He stood for a minute gazing at it by the light of his flashlamp . Undiffused in airlessness , a wan puddle of luminance draped itself over a form that was too alien to seem hideous , as human corpses usually did after a violent death ; the Baburite looked pitifully small and frail . I 'm wastingtime , which I still have though he no longer does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verge , into the cavity of the derelict . Star-gleam and his flash picked out surrealistically intricate masses half submerged in darkness . A bleak pleasure jumped in him . Good luck for us ! This seems to 've been the main drive room . Which means control units , too , if their craft are laid out along rqughly the same lines as ours . It could be the fulfillment of the hope which had led to his and his companions ' search . So little was known about the race which built the invading armada . Who could tell what clues might lie in their en-gineering ? Would the Commonwealth admiral get the same thought , and order a salvage operation for intelligence purposes ? Probably not . His fleet was too hard pressed . Besides , its entire management bespoke idiocy  --  well , be charitable and say ignorance  --  at the highest levels of government . And assuming that relics nevertheless did get back to Earth , the government would scarcely share them with van Rijn . Falkayn was not simply being loyal to his patron ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinker left in the Solar System . Van Rijn might be able to make something of a bit of evidence that was meaningless to everybody else . Not that we can do any serious work here , Falkayn knew . We have n't the facilities . Also , it 's too bloody dangerous to linger very long . But we can spend a few hours investigating , and we can carry off selected items for closer examination . Maybe we 'll make a marginallyuseful discovery . Maybe . Move ! He crept toward the nearest of the forms which towered beforehim.  |p86The  evening before he left , Bayard Story invited Nicholas van Rijn to join him for dinner . The Council of the League had dissolved in dissonance , and the delegates must now see to their own affairs as best they could . The Saturn Room of the Hotel Universe was nearly full , though thanks to widely spaced tables and discreet lighting it did not seem so . Perhaps , when rumors of war hissed everywhere about them , friends and lovers were seizing whatever enjoyment they might while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ System had been withoutdirect experience of armed conflict for so long that it was hard to guess how anybody would behave . Couples held each other close while they moved about on the dance floor . Was there really a wistful note in the music of the live orchestra ? Overhead lifted the vast halfcirclesof the rings , tinted more subtly than rainbows in a violet sky where four moons were presently visible . Sparks of light flickered in the streaming arcs and meteors clove the heavens . Where a tiny sun was setting , dimmed by thick air , clouds lay tawny and rosy . " The place is more suitable for romance than for a pair of tired businessmen , " Story remarked with a slight smile . " Well , any notion we can agree is plenty romantic , " grunted van Rijn from the depths of the menu . His free hand brought to his mouth alternate slurps of akvavit and gulps of beer . Story sipped a champagne and rum . " Let me see  --  dood en ondergang , please to let me see , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I begin with a dozen Limfjord oysters , Limfjord , mind you , waiter , the chilled crab legs and asparagus tips , and fifty grams of Strasbourg pate . Then while I eat my appetizer you can fill me a nice bowl of onion soup a la Ansa . You do not want to miss that , Story , it uses spices we maybe do not get any more if comes something as stupid as a war . For a wine with the soup  --  " He went on for several minutes . " Oh , bring me the tournedos on the regular dinner , medium rare , " Story laughed . " And , all right , I will have the onion soup , since it 's recommended . "  | " You should pay better attention to what you eat , boy , " van Rijn said . Story shrugged . " I do n't make a god of my stomach . " " You think I do , ha ? No , by damn , I make my stomach work for me , like a slave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay attention to . And what is wrong with that ? Who is harmed ? The very first miracle Our Lord did was turning water into wine , and a select vintage it was , too . " Van Rijn shook his head ; the ringlets swirled across his brocade jacket . " The troublemakers , they are those what are not contentedwith God 's gifts of good food , drink , music , women , profit . No , they bring on misery because they must play at being God themselves , they will be our Saviors with a capital ass . " Story grew grave . " Are you sure you 're not the self-righteous one ? What you were advocating at the Council could have , almost cernot. tainly would have gotten the League into war . " Van Rijn 's hedge of eyebrows twisted together in a scowl . " I think League and Commonwealth together would be too much for Babur . It would retreat . " " Maybe  --  if the Commonwealth were willing to go along with puttingMirkheim under League administration . But you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commonwealthgovernment  --  trusteeshipwill mean that they dispose of the supermetals . It 'll be their entry into space on a scale of operations grand enough to threaten the Seven and the independents with being driven to the wall . " " So by keeping us deadlocked , you pest-bespattered Seven guaranteedthe united League does nothing , does not even exist . " " The League will stay neutral , you mean . Do you actually want an open , irrevocable breach in it ? As is , the Seven keeping on reasonablygood terms with Babur , whichever side wins , the League as a whole will have a voice . In fact , when I 'm back in my headquarters , I 'm going to see if the Seven can lend their good offices toward a settlement . " Story lifted a finger . " That 's why I wanted to see you tonight , Freeman van Rijn . A last appeal . If you 'd cooperate with us , and try to get the independents to join you  --  " " Cooperate ? " Van Rijn took out his snuffbox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would that amount to ? Doing whatever you tell ? ( Hrrromp ! ) " " Well , of course we 'd have to have a central strategy . It would involvean embargo , declared or undeclared , on trade with either side . We could plead hazard , to be diplomatic about it . Both would soonp88start hurting for materials , including military materials , and be more ready to accept League mediation . " " Not the League 's , " van Rijn said . " Not the whole League 's . How would the Home Companies fit in ? They and the Commonwealth government is two sides of the same counterfeit coin , by damn . They been that way more and more for  --  how long ?  --  ever since the Council of Hiawatha , I think . " " I 'm not saying anything I have n't often before , " Story pursued . " I simply have a  --  well , I wo n't call it a prospect of making you see reason . Let 's say I feel it my duty to keep trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My duty is not that I listen . I told you and told you , me , if the independentsjoin up with the Seven , or with the Home Companies either , that is truly the end of the League , because we independents is the last properly spiritous members of it . " Van Rijn leaned back , glass to lips , and gazed at the mighty simulacrum above him . Night had fallen on the scene , the moons hung in frost halos and Saturn 's shadow began to creep across the rings . No stars had appeared . He sighed . " We was born too late , though . If I had been at the Council of Hiawatha , what I could have warned them ! " " They made a perfectly logical decision , " Story said . Van Rijn nodded . " Ja . That was the deadly part of it . " Not until long afterward would historians appreciate the irony of the meeting having gathered where it did . At the time , if there was any conscious symbolism in the choice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O'Neill colonies had not only given man his first dwellingsin space , the burgeoning of wholly new industries within them had been of primary importance in a revival of free enterprise . So thoroughgoing did that revival become , in ways of thinking and living as well as in economics , that , together with the alloying of formerly disparate Terrestrial societies , a whole civilization can be thought to have come freshly into existence  --  the Technic . After the development of the hyperdrive , man 's explosive expansion away from Sol made the artificial worldlets obsolete . Yet they continued faithfully orbiting around their Lagrangian points , in Luna 's path but sixty degrees ahead or behind , and were not abandoned overnight . In particular , Hiawatha and its companion Minnehaha still housed substantial working populations when the Polesotechnic League called the most fateful of its executive sessions.  |p89The  problem it faced was manifold . Quite naturally , most governmentsresented it . Although its constitution made it simply a mutualhelpassociation , it wielded more strength than any single state . It hampered as well as humiliated governments when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domestic trade ; when its hard credit displaced their fiat money ; when their attempts at regulation were covertly subverted or openly scorned . Nor was this a mere matter of officialdom hankering for power . Many grudges were genuine . No system that mortals devise is perfect ; all break their share of lives . A poor boy or girl or nonhuman might rise to living like a god and controlling forces that would have been beyond the imagination of mytbmakers . Efficient underlings could do very well for themselves . But those would always exist who did not have the special abilities or the plain luck . Most were not too unhappy at becoming routineers ; some were poisonously embittered . More important , perhaps , was that large percentage of mankind which never really wanted to be free . Of this , a majority yearned for security , which political candidatespromised to get for them . A more active minority wanted solidaritybehind exciting causes , and thought that everybody else should desire the same thing . The League had its own troubles . Sheer scale and diversity of undertakings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the larger companies . The concept of free contract was being increasingly abused , as in the establishment of indentures . Reckless exploitation of societies and natural resources was waxing . Ominous was the introduction of modern technologies to backward races without careful prior consideration  --  irresponsibly , for a quick credit , regardless of whether it was desirable to have such cultures loose with things like spaceships and nuclear weapons . A parliament was finally elected in the Commonwealth that was pledged to thoroughgoing reforms ; and its jurisdiction was still the League 's greatest market and source of manpower . In the " thousand days " it passed an astonishing number of radical new laws and , what counted , began enforcing them as well as a good many old ones . Therefore the Polesotechnic League called a Grand Council at Hiawatha to discuss what to do . It enacted several resolutions which founded more humane and farsighted policies than hitherto . Where it unknowingly came to grief was in the question raised by the measures in the Commonwealth . These included a central banking commission , floors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antitrust rule , compulsory arbitration ofp90certain kinds of disputes , loans by the state to distressed enterprises , subsidies to industries deemed critical , production quotas , and much else . A few hotheads among the delegates talked about resorting to arms , but were shouted down . While members of the League had occasionallyoverturned difficult local governments , the League itself was not in the business of government . The decision to be made was : Should it boycott the Commonwealth until the recent legislation was repealed , or should it acquiesce within the Solar System ? Acquiescence won . A boycott would be immensely expensive , would ruin several members if they were n't underwritten and badly hurt the rest . It would also create an unpleasant image of sabertoothedgreed versus the altruistic statesman . In vain did some speakers argue that in the long run it is best to stand firm by one 's principles , and that the principle which gave the League its sole meaning and justification was liberty . Opponents retorted that liberty demands frequent compromises and , on a less exalted plane , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they actually had variousfeatures desirable from a mercantile point of view ; and in any case , by remaining on the scene the League companies would stay influential and could work for modifications . And indeed this proved to be true . Regulatory commissions soon turned into creatures of the industries they regulated  --  and discouraged ( at first ) or stifled ( later ) all new competition . This was much aided by a tax structure heavily weighted against the middle class . After a while , the great bankers were not just handling money , they were creating it , with a vested interest in inflation . Union leaders , with enormous funds to invest , fitted cozily into the system ; if you did not enroll , you did not work , and the leaders and the managers between them set the conditions under which you must work . Antitrust actions penalized efficient management to the satisfaction of the less enterprising . Likewise did quotas , tariffs , wage and price limits , preferentialcontract policies . A set of ineffective but self-perpetuating welfare programs helped produce the votes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the Commonwealth became . No longer distinct from politicians or bureaucrats , the magnates of the Home Companiesgained a powerful say in decisions about matters far removed from finance or engineering . Their natural allies became the heads of various other constituencies  --  geographical , cultural , professional  --  which were thus brought under ever closer governmental control.  |p91Meanwhile  , companies which did not have an originally strong position in the Commonwealth found themselves being more and more squeezed out . Accordingly , they concentrated on developing markets beyond its borders . They were involved in the declarations of independenceof several colony planets , some of whose politics they then gradually took over . Certain of them began to make cooperative agreements , limiting competition among themselves , to the exclusion of the rest of the League . Thus , by slow stages , were born the Seven In Space . Lesser companies , fearful of being engulfed , avoided joining either side , and formed no organization of their own . They were the independents . By no means did the Council of Hiawatha produce these results overnight . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if anything , more dominated by capitalists than before . It was the most expansive , most brilliant time which Technic civilization would ever know . At home , remedies applied to the body politic took hold quite gradually , and their side effects were still slower to become obvious . On the stellar frontier , discovery followed discovery , triumph followed triumph ; each year told of an evil conquered , a fortune made ; if strife ran high , likewise did hope . The tree was growing , ever leafing , though a snake gnawed its roots . Thus was it often before on Earth , in the age of the Chun-Chiu , the age of the Delian alliance , the age of the Renaissance . But when a century had passed " Well , never mind stale history , " Story said . " We 're alive now , notthen . Will you join the Seven in making a peace effort ? " " Join . " Van Rijn tugged his goatee . " You mean take orders fromyou and not ask rude questions . " " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communications as slow as they are , compared to the speed with which a crisis can build up , we must have a clear chain of command . " Van Rijn shook his head . " No , always I am too hungry for feed-back . " Story made a chopping gesture . " Do you want to cut yourself off entirely from whatever congress makes the peace ? " " It is not sure there will be a congress , and double not sure what tune it will dance to . . . . Ah , here comes my appetizers . You will be surprised , Freeman , at how much I can bite all by myself . "  |p92Sandra  Tamarin-Asmundsen was in the Arcadian Hills , hunting , when word reached her . Though she had felt guilty about leaving Starfall at a time of crisis  --  domestic as well as foreign , with more and more of the Traver class in an uproar  --  a brief escape from its atmospherewas like spring water going through a dried-out throat . Her hounds had gotten on the track of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savage plainsong in green cathedral dimness . She bounded in pursuit of the noise . Her hands parted branches and scanty underbrush , her feet overleaped fallen trees , her lungs drank breath after sweet-scented breath , her eyes beheld high boles , overarching branches rich with leaves , sunflecks in shadow , the brilliant wings of a nidiflex , her body rejoiced . After her bounded half a dozen men from the ancestral estate at Windy Rim . Otherwise the wilderness was hers alone . She sped up a slope and came out onto a meadow along the top of a cliff . The light of Maia was almost blinding on the low lobate yerb , studded with tiny white wildflowers , that covered this open ground . Beyond , she saw further hills , rank upon arrogant rank , and in the distance the solitary peak of Cloudhelm , its snows veiled in mist . The dogs had the cyanops cornered at the edge . A rangy , heavy-jawed , dun-coated breed raised by folk in these parts , they knew better than to attack iron-gray scales and raking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the big herpetoid down if they must , it had lumbered from them . Now it stood its ground and hissed defiance . " Oh , good ! " Sandra exulted . She unslung her rifle and approached with care . A hasty shot might hit a dog or merely madden the beast . It was hard to kill except by a bullet straight through one of those eerily innocent-looking blue eyes . The portable phone at her belt buzzed . She stopped dead . The clamor of hounds and men dropped out of her awareness . Via relay satellite , the phone leashed her to the New Keep and nowhere else . It buzzed again . She unclipped the small flat box and brought it near her face . " Yes ? " A voice rattled forth : " Andrew Baird , Your Grace "  --  her ap/pointed vice executive whom she had left in charge during her absence . " We have received word from Admiral Michael "  --  Michael Falkayn , her second in command of the little Hermetian navy . " They 've detected a substantial fleet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction of Mogul . Distance is still too great for anything but simple code signals . The strangers have sent none so far , nor responded to any of ours . " It was as if a machine spoke for Sandra , free of the dread that shocked through her : " Get every unit into space that is n't already , and have them report to him for duty . Alert every police and rescue corps . Keep me informed of developments as they occur . ' Twill take me . . . about ninety minutes to reach my car , and another hour to fly to you . " Not pausing to hear his goodbye , she put the phone back on her belt and swung about . Her men stood in a bunch ; their gaze upon her was troubled . As if sensing something , the hounds grew less noisy . " I must return immediately . " She rinsed her mouth from her canteenbefore she started down into the forest at a long , energy-conservinglope . Two hunters tarried to call off the pack . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had saved its life . Sandra 's eastbound flight kept her near the Palomino River , which shone like a saber drawn across the lowlands . They were an agrarian property of the Runeberg domain . At the present season , the summer green of pastures was fading ; but even from her altitude , the herds that grazed them were majestic . Opulent grainfields mingled with orchardsand groves . Houses belonging to Follower families in charge of various sections stood snug beneath their red tiles , amidst their gardens . Afar she glimpsed the mansion of the Runebergs themselves . She had visited there and remembered well its gracious rooms , ancestralportraits , immensity of tradition , and children 's laughter for a sign that new life was ever bubbling up from beneath these things . Not for the first time , a moment 's wistfulness touched her . To be born into the Kindred , the thousand families who headed the domains . . . Her descent went back as far as theirs ; her forebears had also been among the first passengers from Earth . It was almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tame a particular part of this world . Instead , they had mostly been scientists , technicians , consultants , explorers , teachers : free lances . Too late to change , she thought . When the constitution of an independentHermes was written , it specified that the chief executivesp94would be of Tamarin birth but that the Tamarins should have no domain : a lonely glory . I could have refused election , she recalled . Why did n't I ? Well , pride , and . . . and Pete was there , my consort , to help me . But supposinghe 'd not been . . . well , had I refused , I 'd have become like any other Tamarin who 's not made Grand Duke or Duchess , I 'd have had my living to earn as best I could  --  a Traver in all but name and , yes , in having a vote . Defensively , as if an accuser from that class confronted her in yet another public debate : And what 's so bad about Traver status ? Comes the word not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hireling or an unaffiliated busi-nessman ? I might have joined a family of the Kindred by marrying into it . That would have been best . She could have gotten the in-between degree of Follower in the same way , merging her bloodline with one that held entailed shares making it a junior partner in a domain . But she would always have been embarrassed to address with certain courtesies the high-ranking people who had been her childhood playmates . To be of the Kindred , though  --  not necessarily serene on a landed estate ; quite likely in some other of the industrial , scientific , cultural , or public service undertakings of a corporation  --  yes , thus she could strike roots deep into her planet , and know how securely her children would belong . The car phone projected Eric 's image . " Mother ! " he cried . " You 've heard . . . Listen , I just have , and  --  " " Get off the circuit , " she interrupted . " Baird may be calling me at any minute . " Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took time to add : " You might make sure Lorna gets to a safe place . I daresay you 'll insist on being at the Keep . " " Right . I . . . I 'll stand by in the Sapphire Office . " His countenancevanished . The wind of her speed roared around the car 's canopy . Sandra straightened in her seat . No use wishing she were different from what she was . And did she really wish it , anyway ? Somebody had to hold the reins of the state . If only because of experience , she could probablydo so better than anyone else . Hang on , she thought ahead of her . I 'm coming . Starfall appeared on the horizon , at first a darkness along the bright sheet of Daybreak Bay ; then as she slipped downward it became the buildings , streets , parks , quays , monuments she had loved of old . Yonder stood the Mayory in red brick dignity , nearby lifted the slim spire of St. Carl 's Church , the Hotel Zeus soared abovep95Phoenix Boulevard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Riverside Common , traffic was dense and terrace cafes busy at Constitution Square , she actually identified Jackboot Lane where stood the Ranger 's Roost tavern that had seen her drink and talk and sing in her youth like generations before her . . . . Pilgrim Hill stood ahead . A police car hung above Signal Station . Sandra flashed it her name and made for the ducal parking roof . The thought that all this might go out in a burst of radioactive flame was unendurable . The Insignia Room was large and austere , ornamented only with the devices of the Kindred on its walls . They were colorful , but a thousand of them crowded together soon became featureless in the mind . On this high floor , windows gave on sky , long evening light , a glimpse of ocean , an ornithoid winging by . Yet as Sandra sat behind her desk , the chamber felt small , warm , dear , against the darkness at its far end . A three-dimensional comscreen occupied half that wall . It was as if cold radiated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Baburite whose outlines posed before her did not seem dwarfish or bizarre  --  rather , the eidolon of something gigantic and triumphant . The picture showed a bit of a compartment aboard its ship , which hung in synchronous orbit above the city and sent down a tight beam . The fittings and furnishings were too alien for her fully to see . Behind and around the being loomed reddish dusk wherein dim shapes stirred . " Hear us well , " a vocalizer said for it . " We represent the Imperial Band of Sisema and the united race . " War is inevitable between the Autarchy of Babur and the Solar Commonwealth . We have intelligence that the Commonwealth will seek to occupy the Maian System . Your resources would obviously be of extreme value to a navy campaigning far from home : especially the terrestroid planet Hermes . There bases are easy to build , repairs and munitions to make , accumulated toxins to flush out of the life support systems of ships ; personnel can get rest and hospital care , recruitscan possibly be found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . " " We 're neutral ! " Sandra 's hands strained together . Their palms were damp , their fingers chill . " Your neutrality would not be respected , " said the Baburite . " It is necessary that the Imperial Band forestall the Commonwealth and establish a protectorate . Hear us well . A fleet detachment , which yourp96admiral will have told you is considerably your superior in strength , is waiting at the outer limits of your planetary system . Its mission is to prevent Commonwealth forces from entering . " You will cooperate with it . A majority of the crews are oxygen breathers who will be based on Hermes . Their correct behavior is guaranteed ; but hostile actions directed at them will be severely punished . You will deal with them , as well as with the Baburite command , through our military authority . " Conduct yourselves properly , and you need have no fears . The Maian System contains no planet which Baburites could colonize . Their ways and yours are so mutually foreign that interference of one with another is unlikely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , against which you will be shielded . " Sandra half rose . " But we do n't want your shielding  --  " She choked down more words like you filthy worm . " It is necessary that you accept , " said the emotionless voice . " Resistancewould cost the Imperial Band casualties , but you your entire armed service . Thereafter , Hermes would lie exposed to bombardmentfrom space . Consider the welfare of your people . " Sandra sank back . " When would you come ? " she whispered . " We will move as soon as this conference is over . " " No , wait . You realize not  --  I ca n't issue orders to a whole world , I 've not dictatorial powers  --  " " You will have time to persuade . The ships of the Imperial Band will need it to deploy , since they can not use hyperdrive within the inner parts of the system . You can be granted as much as four of your planetary rotations before the surrender of your navy and the landing of the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : hot protest and frosty demand , plea and refusal , bargaining over detail after detail , wrath and despair met by calm immovability ; but the time was far shorter than it would have been between two humans . The Baburite was simply not concerned about honorific formulas , face savings , alternatives , compromises . Conceivablyit might have been , had the gulf between the races been less unbridgeably wide . Sandra remembered the cyanops on the cliff edge , hounds and hunters before it . When at last the screen blanked , she covered her eyes for a little before she summoned her cabinet to come witness the playback and give her what counsel it could . Up and down Eric Tamarin-Asmundsen paced , from end to end of the living room in his mother 's apartment . She had set the lights lowp97and left open the French doors to the balcony , for it was a beautiful night , both moons aloft and nearly full , dew aglimmer on lawns and the crowns of trees , cool air full of the odor of daleflower and the trills of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky-glow from the city picked out a few steeples . The lamps of cars flitting overhead were like many-colored glowflies . Eric 's boots thudded savagely on the carpet . " We ca n't just give in , " he said for the dozenth frantic time . " We 'd be slaves forever . " " We 're promised internal self-government , " Sandra reminded him from the chair where she sat . " How much is that promise worth ? " She drew heavily on her cigar . The smoke tasted harsh ; she 'd had too many in the past several hours . " I know not , " she admitted in a flat tone . " Still , I ca n't imagine any interest the Baburites might take in our local politics . " " Intend you to wait with folded hands and find out ? " " We ca n't fight . Michael sent me his considered opinion that our forces are grossly outnumbered . Why kill and be killed to no good end ? " " We can organize guerrillas . " " They 'd spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ epoch , Hermes had a single continent , Greatland , so enormous that most of its interior was a desert of blazing summers and bitter winters . " Worse , they 'd invite reprisals on everybody else . And never could they defeat well-equipped troops on the ground , missile-throwingships in orbit . " " Oh , we ca n't free ourselves alone . " Eric 's arm slashed the air . " But see you not , if we lie down to be walked on  --  if we actually add our fleet to theirs , let our factories work for them  --  why should the Commonwealth care what happens to us ? It might leave us under Babur as part of a bargain . Whereas if we 're its allies , no matter how minor  --  " Sandra nodded . " Believe me , the Council and I discussed this at length . I dare not tell Michael to lead our ships off . He 'd be interceptedby a squadron of theirs , have to fight his way past them . " Eric stopped in midstride . " Hermes is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is it ? " Sandra locked her glance with his , for seconds . " The admiral and I have our understanding , " she said at last . " What ? " It blazed in Eric . " No untoward sentence passed between us . I 'd better not say more , even to you . "  | " And you 're going , too ! " he shouted . " A government in exile , by the whole Trinity , yes ! " " My duty is here . " " No . " Sandra slumped . " Eric , dear , I 'm wrung dry . Plague me not . You should go join Lorna . " He gazed at the big woman , who had turned her face outward to the night , until he said , " All right . I see . For your part , will you help Lorna forgive me ? " She nodded wearily . " I expected you 'd go , and I 'll not plead , " she replied low . " You are my son . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The ghost of a smile crossed her lips . " He 'd not hare off to be a dashing warrior . He 'd stay put and brew trouble till the Baburites wished they 'd never stirred from their planet . " Her calm broke . " Oh , Eric ! " She dropped her cigar and rose , arms outspread . They embraced hard . Nothing remained to say in words . After a while , he kissed her and departed . He did not take the ducal space-yacht , but his personal runabout . It barely overhauled the Hermetian ships . They were already acceleratingout of the system . Admiral Falkayn did not summon him aboard Alpha Cygni , but assigned him to the destroyer North Atlantis . That proved to be sound thinking . Soon afterward , as had been easily predictable , they encountered those units of the Baburite task force which were near enough to interceptthem . As yet , they were too deep in Maia 's gravitational well to go safely into hyperdrive . " Hold vectors steady , " Falkayn ordered them . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at will . " The captain of North Atlantis had allowed Eric on the bridge as a courtesy , provided the heir apparent keep absolutely quiet . That was a command more stern than chains . Presently he felt the scourge , as the hostile forces closed . Around his eyes blazed the stars in their thousands , the Milky Way foamed across the girth of heaven , a nebula shone distance-dimmed bearing new suns and worlds in its womb , the Magellanic Clouds and the Andromeda galaxy glimmered in their mystery . That was one part of reality . The opposite part was the hardness which enclosed him , faint beat of driving energies and mumble of ventilators , men who stood thralls of instruments and controls , the wetness and reek of his own sweat . . . and a muttered " First shot theirs . Must'vep99been a missile from Caduceus that stopped it , " as flame winked briefly afar . The kinetic velocities of both groups were too high to match in a single pass . They intermingled , exchanging fire , for minutes ; then they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ghastly rose unfold , where a weapon from his vessel had tracked down another from the foe . Otherwise the explosions were remote , hundreds of kilometersoff , and registered as glints ; an energy beam striking a target did not register at all . Seated like a statue , the destroyer 's captain heard the combat analysisofficer report in a cracking voice : " Sir , practically every strike of theirs is concentrated on Alpha Cygni . They must hope to saturate her defenses . " " I was afraid of that , " the captain said dully . " The only capital ship we 've got . The Baburites are more interested in stopping her than buzzbugs like this . " " If we accelerated in her direction , sir , we might be able to catch a few of their missiles . " " Our orders are to maintain our vectors . " The captain 's features remained visor-blank ; but he glanced across at Eric . " The important thing is that some of us escape . " The officer swallowed . " Aye , sir . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alpha Cygni had taken a warhead . No further word came from her  --  but flash after flash of fireball did , for her screens and interceptors were now gone , and even receding , the Baburites could pound her hulk into dust and slag . The captain of North Atlantis looked straight at Eric . " I think you 're our new commander , sir , " he said . " C-carry on . " The son of the Duchess wrestled down a scream . Battle faded out . Eventually the Hermetian flotilla dared enter hyperdrive . Detectors declared the enemy was not pursuing . Because they spent their main effort on the battleship , the invaders had taken losses of their own , making theirs temporarily the inferior force . Divisionsof their armada elsewhere were too far-flung to have any hope of catching up . Besides , fighting at faster-than-light was a tricky business of drawing alongside and trying to match phase ; a kill was too unlikely to make the attempt worthwhile , when Hermes had not yet been brought under the yoke . Eric rose . Each muscle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the highest feasible rate , " he ordered . " Have everybody standp100by for a message from me . " His grin was acid . " I 'd better give them a talk , not ? " In this wise died Michael Falkayn , older brother of David and , since their father 's death a pair of years ago , head of the Falkayn domain . As swift as any vessel in that near-infinitesimal droplet of the galaxywhich we have slightly explored , Muddlin ' Through reached Earth almost simultaneously with the first messengers from the embattledMirkheim expedition , whose survivors would not come limpingin for two or more weeks . Traffic Control kept her hours in orbit . Her crew did manage to swap a few radioed words with Nicholas van Rijn . " I will meet you at Ronga , " the merchant said  --  and little else , when communication was surely being monitored . The likelihood of war had evidently thrown the bureaucrats in charge of space safety into a blue funk . But clearance finally came . Ship and pilot were licensed to set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Muddlehead got orders to make for a certainatoll in the South Pacific Ocean . Approached from above , the scene was impossibly lovely . The waters shone in a thousand shades of blue and green , sunlight sparklingover their wrinkled vastness ; breakers burst silvery on the coral necklace of the island , within whose arc a lagoon lay like an amethyst ; tall clouds massed in the west , their purity shaded azure , while elsewhere heaven was a dome of light . We have so few places like this left on Earth , David Falkayn thought fleetingly . Is that  --  not ambition , not adventure , no , the longing for a peace which only our genes remember  --  is that what really sends us out into the universe ? Feather-softly , landing jacks touched the surface of a small paved field . The main personnel lock opened and its gangway extruded . Falkayn had been waiting there , but Chee Lan darted between his legs and reached ground first , bounced in the air , sped to the adjacent beach , and rolled on warm white sand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to meet him . Then he also ran.  | " Davy , oh , Davy ! " Coya flung herself at him and they kissed for an unbroken minute or better , while Adzel paraded discreetly by . Waves rushed and murmured , seabirds cried . " I tried to call you right after the boss , " Falkayn stammered . What a poor greeting words gave . " He 'd already contacted me , told me to come here , " she said , leaninghappily against him . " How 're Juanita and X ? " He saw , as he had felt , the growth of the child within her during the weeks of his absence . " Fat and sassy . Look over yonder . C'm on . " She tugged his arm . Van Rijn stood at the border of the field , holding his great-granddaughterby the hand . As the newcomers reached them , the girl released herself , flew to Daddy to be hugged , then from his embrace looked up at Adzel and chirped , " Ride ? " The dragon set her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Palms soughed in a wind whose salt was sweetened by odors of jasmine ; hibiscus and bougainvillea glowed ardent in arbors . " Welcome home , by damn , " van Rijn boomed . " Was a pony long wait , not knowing if you was chopped into cutlets or what . " Falkayn broke stride . A chill blew across his joy . " Then you did n't get our dispatch ? " he said . " We sent a torp from the neighborhood of Mogul . " " No , nothings . Our data bank stayed bare as a mermaid 's bottom . " Falkayn 's grip tightened around Coya 's waist . That time had surely been , for her , the frozen ninth circle of hell . " I was afraid you might not , " he said slowly . " You mean somebody snaffled it ? " Coya asked . " Ja , " van Rijn growled . " The Space Service , who elses ? Plain to see , they got secret orders to take anything for me to somebody different . " " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Home Companies is behind it , of course , and in a case like this they do n't give snot whether it 's illegal or well eagle . I hope you used cipher , Davy . " " Yes , naturally , " Falkayn said . " I do n't think they can have brokenit . " " No , but you see , they kept me from getting maybe an advantage in this diarrhea-fluid situation we got . I seven-point-three-tenths expectedit . . . . Here we are . " The party climbed the steps , crossed a verandah , and entered an airily furnished room where stood a table covered with drinks and snacks.  |p102Chee  soared to a chair , crouched on it , and chattered , " You 've heard about a battle commencing at Mirkheim , I gather . We were there . Earlier , the wan-yao jan-gwo chai reng pfs-s-st Baburites jailed us  --  " Her native phrase gave a succinct description of their ancestors , morals , personal cleanliness , and fate if she could have her way . " Oh , no , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rijn commanded . " I decree first we snap some schnapps , with a little liter or so of beer in tow and maybe a few herringfilets or such for ballast . You do not want your new baby should become an adrenalin addict , ha ? " " Nor this young lady , " said Adzel , for Juanita 's giggles had given place to a worried silence . He reached around , lifted her off his shoulders , and started juggling her from hand to enormous hand . She squealed in delight . Her parents did n't mind ; she was safer with him than with anybody else they knew , including themselves . " Well  --  " Falkayn could not quite yield to pleasure . " What 's been happening at home ? " " Nothing , except the bomb going ticktacktoe , " van Rijn said . " Bayard Story , he made one last try to get me in combination with the Seven , what meant putting me under their orders . I told him to paint it green , and he left the Solar System @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would like to do a hysteria-ectomy on . " " Who 's Bayard Story ? " Chee inquired . " A director of Galactic Developments , delegate to the meeting at Lunograd , " van Rijn told her . " He was pretty much the spokesman for the Seven . In fact , I suspect he was the wheelsman . " " Mmm , yes , I remember now , I happened to see his arrival on a newscast , " Falkayn put in . " I admired his skill in giving the reporter a brief , crisp , straightforward statement that did n't say a flinkin ' thing . " He turned to Coya . " No matter . Have n't you anything special to relate , darling ? " " Oh , I was offered a contract by Danstrup Cargo Carriers , " she answered , referring to an independent within the League . Since she stopped trade pioneering , she had worked out of her home as a highpoweredfree-lance computer programmer . " They wanted an analysis of their best strategy in case of war . Everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be , nobody wants it , but still we drift and drift . . . . It 's horrible , Davy . Can you imagine how horrible ? " Falkayn brushed a kiss across her hair . " Did you take the job ? "  | " No . How could I , not being sure what had become of you ? I 've filled in the time with routine-type stuff . And  --  and I 've played a lot of tennis , that sort of thing , to help me sleep . " She shared his distrust of chemical consolations . In a way , van Rijn did too . He used alcohol not as a crutch but as a pogo stick . " Drink , you slobberwits ! " he roared . " Or do I have to give it to you with a hypochondriac needle ? You got home safe , that 's what matters first . So crow about it ; then look at this nice table of goodies and raven . " Adzel set Juanita down . " Come , " he said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tea party . " She paused to pet Chee . The Cynthian submitted , merely switching her tail . Yet it was impossible to pretend for long that no universe existed beyond the blue overhead . Soon the Muddlin ' Through trio were relating their experiences . Van Rijn listened intently , interrupting less often than Coya with questions or exclamations . At the end : " This equipment you salvaged from the warship , did you learn anything about it on your way home ? " he asked . " Very little . " Falkayn rubbed the back of his neck . " And damned puzzling . Most of what we saw , as well as what we took away , is modeled on Technic designs , as you 'd expect . But certain transistors  --  we ca n't figure out how they were manufactured in a hydrogen atmosphere . Hydrogen would poison the semiconductors . " " Maybe they 're produced off Babur , like on a satellite , " Coya suggested . " Maybe , " Falkayn said . " Though I ca n't see why . Alternative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that much trouble . Then there 's a unit which we guess to be a containment fieldstrengthregulator . It involves a rectifier operating at a high temperature . Okay . But this particular rectifier is cupric oxide . Hydrogen reduces that stuff when it 's hot ; you get copper and water . Oh , yes , the piece is inside an iron shell to protect it . But hydrogen leaks through iron . So what the Baburites have got is a part less reliable , more often in need of replacement , than necessary . " " Bad engineering as a result of haste , " Coya offered with a quirked smile . " Not the first time in history . " " True , " Falkayn said . " But  --  Look , the Baburites have had offplanet help . That much was admitted to us ; and we identified an oxygen-breather colony on one of their moons , you recall ; and there are those foreign mercenaries , also oxygen-breathing . Obviously they hired such outsiders to help them with research , development , andp104production of their military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job ? " Van Rijn stumped about , worrying his goatee and crunching bites off a Spanish onion . " More interesting is how the Baburites found those people , and how paid them as well as the other costs , " he opined . " Babur is not a rich world nor very populous , proportional to its size , even allowing for industrial backwardness . Too much of it is desert , for lack of liquid ammonia . What has it to pay with ? " " It did do some interstellar trade in the past , " Falkayn reminded . " Possibly somebody made contact or  --  I do n't know . You 're right , it 's tough to find an economic explanation for everything they 've managed to accomplish . " " Or any kind of explanation for their actions , by billy damn . I never sent you off expecting the kind of gumblesnatch you got into . No , I thought sure the Baburites would talk at you , probably not tell you much but anyhows talking . The sensible thing from their viewpointshould be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they stay friends with the League , or at least not make it also an activatedenemy . Nie ? " " They seemed , from what microscopic contact we had with them , they seemed contemptuous of the League . They certainly know it 's divided against itself . " " How can they be so cock-a-doodle sure of that ? Do we savvy the ins and outs of their politics ? And why not try to take advantage of our divisions ? For instance , they might get the Seven and the independentsbidding competitive for business with them . .. if they treat the representatives halfway decent . " " Could you simply have run into an overzealous official ? " Coya wondered . Falkayn shook his head . " From what smidgen we know of the Baburites , hardly , " he replied . " They do n't appear to be organized that way . They do n't have hierarchies of individuals holding positions . In their dominant culture , if not in all , it 's a matter of whole Bands overlapping . So-and-so many single beings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and confer about it with their mates ; a given being can be on several different teams . " " That makes for fewer contradictions , " Adzel added , " though likewise , I suspect , less imagination and a lower speed of reaction to developments . " " Which suggests it was a policy agreed on beforehand , that any strangers who arrived would promptly be thrown in the freezer , " Chee said . " Oh , we three have had plenty of time to speculate . "  | " Have you speculated about companies of the Seven possibly maintaining quiet relationships with Babur ? " Coya asked . " Yes . " Falkayn shrugged . " If so , under present circumstances you would n't expect them to advertise the fact , would you ? They could easily have been kept in the dark for decades about the intentions of the Imperial Band . " " Are you positive , dear ? " " Well , what can such a relationship actually have amounted to ? Occasional visits by one or a few agents to a strictly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Earth 's area  --  a much bigger proportion of it dry land , at that . " " Still , " Chee murmured , " the section where significant action has been taking place is n't necessarily huge . " A phone chimed . " Kai-yu ! Of every tyranny you humans have ever saddled yourselves with , that thing has got to be the most insolent . " " Nobody knows I am here but my top secretary , " said van Rijn . His bare feet slap-slapped across the tatami to the instrument . When he pressed accept , it announced , " Edward Garver wishes to speak to you personally , sir . What shall I tell him ? " " What I would like you to tell him is not anatomically possible , " van Rijn grunted . " Put him on . Uh , the rest of you stand back from the scanner . No sense handing out free information . " Square shoulders , bald head , and pugdog face sprang into simulacrum . " You 're on Ronga , I believe , where your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Security without preamble . " You got told about her , ha ? " van Rijn replied , quiet as the center of a hurricane . " I issued standing orders the day I learned she 'd left . " Garver hunched forward , as if to thrust himself past the vitryl . " You 've been a special interest of mine for an almighty long while . " Falkayn  --  still more , perhaps , Adzel , who had once been arrested after a certain incident  --  remembered . Since the years when he was chief law enforcement officer of the Lunar Federation , Garver had hated van Rijn . His terms in the Commonwealth Parliament had put a fresh edge on that . It was an oddly pure passion . Because of the particular encounters they chanced to have had , he saw the merchant as an archetype of everything he abominated about the Polesotechnic League . " I want to know where the crew have been , what they 've done , and why , " he said . " I 'm calling personally so you 'll know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Go ahead and want as much as you feel like . " Van Rijn beamed.  | " Wallow in it . Scrub your tummy with it . Blow bubbles . Try different flavors . " Behind his back , he crooked a finger . Falkayn in turn gesturedto Chee and Adzel , who went quickly out . The younger man stayed by Coya . His partners could remove the log and Baburite apparatus  --  towhich the health inspector had paid no particular attentionprior to their descent  --  from Muddlin ' Through before a search party arrived with a warrant . Another log would remain , which had been faked as a matter of routine . He 'd better brief his wife and his grandfather-in-law fast. "  --  no more of your apishness , " Garver was rasping . " I presume you know about the Baburite attack on our ships . It means war , I guarantee . Parliament will meet , by multiway phone , inside the next hour . And I know what the vote will be . " I do too , Falkayn thought sadly , while silent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we should do nothing about the killing of our men . But this haste  --  ? Well , the Home Companies see a vital interest in Mirkheim . Let the Commonwealth possess it , and that will be their foothold in space , against the Seven . " And the war will purify us , " Garver said . It will give the government powers over free enterprise that it never had before . You ca n't consider the Home Companies free enterprisesany longer . No , they 're part of the power structure . He loathes us because we 've never either joined or toadied to the coalitionof cartels , politicians , and bureaucrats . To him , we represent Chaos . Garver checked himself from orating . With iron joy , he went on : " Meanwhile , as of an hour back , the Premier has declared a state of emergency . Under it , my department takes authority over all spacecraft . We 'll be commandeering , van Rijn ; and no ship will move withoutour permission . I 've called you like this in the faint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation , and what 'll happen to you if you do n't cooperate . " " How sweet of you to tell me , " the merchant replied expressionlessly . " Was there more ? Hokay , pippity-pip . " He switched off . Turning to the rest , he said , " I would not give him the satisfaction . " He jumped up and down . The floor thundered . He pummeledthe air with his fists . " Schijt , pis , en bederf ! " he bellowed . " God throw him in Satan 's squatpot ! His parents was brothers ! May he wish to become decent ! Make us a four-letter Angular-Saxon languagejust for him ! Ga-a-a-ah  --  " Adzel , reentering the house , dropped his load to cover Juanita 's ears . Chee scuttled past him , carrying the log reel , in search of a goodp107hiding place for it . Coya and Falkayn caught at each other . A whine rose outside as two Central Police vehicles came over the horizon and turned downward for a landing . Was this truly Earth ? Eric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was interesting  --  doubtlessbanal to a native , but exotic to him . However , he was too restless . He flung himself off the lounger , strode across his room , halted at a window . Evening was stealing across Rio de Janeiro Integrate . From his high perch his gaze swept over the flowing lines and rich tints of skyscrapers , bold silhouettes of Sugarloaf and Corcovado , bay agleam as if burnished , Niter &; bridge an ethereal tracing . Cars torrented along streets and elevated roads below him , wove an intricate dance through the flight lanes above . He touched a button to open the window and filled his lungs with unconditioned moist heat . No traffic noises actually reached him , but he had a sense of them , the unheard throb of a monster machine , almost like the pulse of a spaceship . The sheer existence of such a megalopolis came near being frightening , now that he stood brow to brow with it . His right hand 's grip on his left wrist tightened . I am not nobody , he defied the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The door chimed . He spun on his heel , heart irrationally jumping . " Come in , " he said . The door swung itself wide . A man , small and dark as most Brazilians apparently were , stood there in a fanciful uniform , holding a package . " This came for you , sir , " he announced in accented Anglic . The Hotel Santos-Dumont employed live servitors . " What ? " Puzzled , Eric approached . " Who 'd be sending me any-thing ? " " I do n't know , sir . It arrived by conveyor a few minutes ago . We knew you were still here and thought you might like to have it at once . " " Well , uh , uh , thank you . " Eric took the parcel . It was in plainp108packwrap and bore only his name and address . The man remained for a moment , then left . The door shut behind him . Damn ! Eric thought . Should I have given him money ? Have n't I read about that as a Terrestrial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . He laid his present on a table and tugged the unsealer . Inside were a box and an envelope . The box held a freshly folded suit of clothes . The envelope held two sheets . On the first was written : " To his Excellency Eric Tamarin-Asmundsen , in appreciation of his gallant efforts , from a member of United Humanity . " Who  --  Wait , it did get mentioned while I was with those politicians and officers yesterday . A mildly racist association , naturally jingoistic about Babur . With the publicity that our escape from Hermes seems to have gotten . . . Hm , a second message . WAIT A GOD-SMITTENMINUTE ! My son , Read this and destroy . Leave the other note lying about so it may satisfy the curiosity of those who have a watch on you . I am anxious to meet you , for your own sake but also for the sake of both our planets and perhaps many more . It must be done secretly , or it is useless . I will only say now that you and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you possibly can , cancel any appointment you have , wear the enclosed outfit , and at 2000 hours  --  Earth-clock , not Hermetian  --  goto the parking roof . Take a taxi numbered 7383 and follow instructions . If you ca n't tonight , make it the same time tomorrow . " Long live freedom and damn the ideologies . " Your father , seismograph scrawlN. van RijnFor a minute that stretched , Eric stood where he was . Old Nick himself , hammered through him . You hear stories about him throughout space as if he were already a myth . Of course I intended to look him up , butHis blood began to sing . After the grinding voyage , the wary reception , the strenuous drabness of two conferences with highly placed Earthlings , conferences that were more like interrogations , the interviewbefore a telenews camera , and now this . . . Why not ? He was invited to dinner at the Hermetian ambassador 's home in Petropolis . He might have been housed there , except for lack ofp109guest facilities ; the embassy had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little to do . Hence the Commonwealth government was treating him to these quarters . Quite possibly they were bugged . Certainlyhe was separated from his crews , who had been sent to dwell in  --  what was the name ?  --  Cape Verde Base ? Yet why should he suspect the Commonwealth ? He had everywheremet politeness , if not effusiveness . Could be I 'll learn tonight . He phoned , pleading fatigue , and postponedhis engagement a day . Room service brought him sandwiches and milk . ( Earth 's food and drink had subtly peculiar tastes . ) Afterwardhe changed into the new garments . They were flamboyant : sheening blue velvyl tunic and culottes , white iridon stockings , scarlet shimmerlyn cloak . Even here , where colorful garb was the rule , he 'd stand out . Should n't he be inconspicuous instead ? Somehow he outlived the wait . Dusk fell . At the designated time he stepped from a grayshaft out onto the roof . The muggy atmospherehad not lost much heat ; the city 's horizon-wide shattered rainbowof lights seemed feverish . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man leaned against the parapet as if admiring the view . Is he a watcher ? The sleek teardrop vehicles bore numbers on their sides . Eric 's was in the middle of the row . How to take it without making obvious that that 's the one I want ? . . . Ah , yes , I know . I hope . He paced back and forth for a bit , cloak aswirl behind him , like a person not sure what to do ; then , passing 7383 , he feigned the impulse that made him lay a hand on its door . It opened . He got in . A shadowy shape crouched on the floor . " Quiet , " muttered forth . Aloud , to the autopilot : " Palacete de Amor . " The car took off vertically , entered the lane assigned it by the traffic monitoring system , and headed west . The man crawled up . " Now I can sit , " he said in Anglic . " They 're following us ; but that far off , they ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . " I 'm honored to meet you , sir . You may as well call me Tom . " Eric accepted the clasp numbly . He was looking at himself . No , not quite . The clothes were identical , the body similar , the head less closely so though it should pass a cursory inspection . Tom grinned . " Partly I 'm disguised , hair dye , maskflesh here and there , et cetera , " he explained . " And a standout costume , which draws attention from me to itself . Gait 's important too . Did you know that you Hermetians walk differently from any breed of Earthling ? Looser jointed . I 've spent the past day in crash-course training . "  | " You .. . are a man of van Rijn 's ? " Eric asked . His mouth was somewhat dry . " Yes , sir . He keeps several like me on tap . Now please listen close . I 'll get off at the Palacete while you hunch down the way I was doing . I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I go in . Meanwhileyou tell the car , To the yacht . ' It is n't really a cab , it just looks like one . It 'll take you to him . At 0600 tomorrow morning , it 'll bring you back to me , I 'll step in , we 'll let you off at your hotel . As far as the Secret Service is concerned , you spent the night at the Palacete . " " What , uh , what am I supposed to be doing there ? " Tom blinked , then guffawed . " Having a glorious time with assorteddelicious wenches after your long journey . Do n't worry , I 'll leave behind me a goodly tale of your prowess . At times like this , I enjoy my work . Nobody will mention it to you ; that 's bad form on Earth . Just be prepared for a few smirks when you tell people you 're tired because you slept poorly . " Eric was spared the need to respond , since Tom said , " Get down " as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they landed , Tom got out , the vehicle took off again . The episode felt unreal . Eric brought his face to a pane and stared . The city fell behind him , the bay , the coast whereon he glimpsed kilometersof magnificent surf . He was over the ocean . Luna stood low ahead , near the full , casting a witchcraft of brilliance across the waves . In its presence , not many stars were visible . Was that bright one Alpha Centauri , the beacon for which men steered when first they departed the Solar System ? Were those four the Southern Cross , famous in books he had read as a boy ? The constellations were strange . Maia was drowned in distance . The car canted . Eric saw a watership in the middle of otherwise empty vastness . She was a windjammer , with three masts rigged fore and aft though only the mizzen sail and a jib were set to keep her hove to . He could n't remember what the type was called ; no pleasure boat on Hermes was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . What a place to meet . The reason was total privacy  --  nevertheless , how wildly romantic , here under Earth 's moon . Lu-natic ? The false taxi came to a hover alongside the starboard rail . Eric emerged , springing to a deck that thudded beneath his feet . The air was blessedly cool . A man took his seat and the vehicle flitted off , to abide somewhere till it must return . More sailors were in sight , but Eric knew the captain at once , huge in the pouring pale radiance . He wore simply a blouse , wraparoundp111skirt , and diamonds glistery on his fingers . " My boy ! " he roared , and stampeded to meet the newcomer . His handshake well-nigh tore an arm off , his backslap sent the Hermetian staggering . " Ho , ho , welcome , by damn ! For this , you bet I give good St. Dismas candles till he wonders if maybe he was martyred by a grease fire . " He clasped his son 's shoulders . " Ja , you got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are what they call extinctive-looking like me . What a jolly roger we raised together , she and me ! Often have I wished I was not too obstreptococcus a bastard for her to live with long . You , now , you is a fine , upstanding type of bastard , nie ? Come below and we talk . " He propelled Eric forward . A lean man in early middle age and a pregnant woman who looked younger stood at the cabin door . Van Rijn halted . " Here is David Falkayn , you heard about him after the Shenna affair , also his wife Coya  --  Hoy , what 's wrong , jongen ? " David Falkayn . I should have expected this . Eric bowed in the manner of kindred among each other . " Well met , " he said ritually , and wondered how he could add what he must . " Below , below , the akvavit calls , " van Rijn urged , less loudly than before . The ship 's saloon was mahogany and mirrorlike brass . Refreshmentscrowded a table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poured with more skill than was obvious from his slapdash manner . " How was Lady Sandra when you left her ? " he asked , still quieter . " Bearing up , " Eric said . " Proost ! " Van Rijn raised his liquor . The rest imitated him , sendingthe chilled caraway spirit down their gullets at a gulp , following it with beer . Across his tankard , Eric studied faces . Coya 's was delicatelymolded , though somehow too strong to be merely pretty . David'swas rakish in shape , rather grim in mien . No , hold , I 'd better think of him as " Falkayn . " Most Earthlings seem to use their surnameswith comparative strangers , like Travers , not the first name like Kindred , and he 's been long off Hermes . Van Rijn 's visage  --  sharply remembered from documentary shows a decade ago following the Shenna business  --  was the most mobile and least readable of the three . What do I actually think of him ? What should I ? Sandra had never spoken much of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't care to dwell on the past . And she had marriedPeter Asmundsen when Eric was four standard years old . The stepfather had won the child 's wholehearted love . That was why Ericp112had never considered seeking out van Rijn , nor given him a great deal of thought until lately . It would have felt almost like disloyalty . But half the genes in yonder gross body were his . And . . . be damned if he was n't enjoying this escapade ! Falkayn spoke . Abruptly Eric recalled the tidings he bore , and lost enjoyment . " We 'd better get straight to work . No doubt you wonder about the elaborate secrecy . Well , we could have arranged to meet you candidly , but it would 've been under covert surveillance  --  not too fussing covert at that . This way , we keep an option or two open for you. , , " I knew you would come , " van Rijn said . " Your mother proved it on Diomedes before you was born . " " We 're not sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coya added . She had a lovely low voice . " The fact is , we 're in the bad graces of the government . " Let me buy time , while I figure out how to tell Falkayn . " Please say on , my lady , " Eric urged . She glanced back and forth between the men . They signed her to continue . She spoke fast and rather abstractly , perhaps as a shield for nervousness . " Well , to generalize , for a long time in the Solar System , underneathall catchwords and cross-currents , the issue has been what shall be the final arbiter . The state , which in the last analysis relies on physical coercion ; or a changeable group of individuals , whose only power is economic . . .. Oh , I know it 's nowhere near that simple . Either kind of leadership might appeal to emotion , for instance  --  yes , does , in fact , because at bottom the choice between them is a matter of how you feel , how you see the universe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hermes , for instance , you get the interesting situationof a state having essentially risen from private corporations . In the Solar System , on the other hand , the so-called Home Companies have become an unofficial but real component of government . In fact , they 've had the most to do with strengthening it , extending its control of everybody 's life . And for its part , it protects them from a lot of the competition they used to have , as well as doing them a lot of differentfavors on request . " She frowned at the table . " This did n't happen because of any conspiracy , you realize . It just . . . happened . The Council of Hiawatha  --  well , never mind . " " You remind me of the final examination in the philosophy class , my dear , " van Rijn said . " The single question was : Why ? ' You got an A if you answered , Why not ? ' You got a B if you answered , ' Because . ' Any other answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's eyes and proceeded . " You must know enough about Solar Spice &; Liquors and its fellow independentsto understand why we are n't popular in the Capitol . We ca n't greatly blame them for fearing us . After all , if we claim the right to act freely , we might do anything whatsoever , and simply the claim itself is a threat to the establishment . When Gunung Tuan  --  Freeman van Rijn  --  sent my husband off on a private expedition during this crisis , that was the last quantum . Commonwealth agents ransacked his ship after he returned , and sequestered her . They did n't find evidence to convict him ; not that David had done anything particularly unlawful . But like everybody else , we 're forbidden to leave Earth except on common carriers . And we 're incessantly spied on . " Eric stirred . His words came hesitant . " Uh , given the war , are n't your interests the same as the Commonwealth 's ? " " If you mean the government of the Commonwealth , " Falkayn said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessarily . Do n't forget , I 'm a Hermetian citizen myself . " And you are now the Falkayn . " I do have my underblanket connections , " van Rijn added . " So I know you is been watched since you arrived . They think : You come for an ally , yes ; but how trustworthy is you ? Anyways , it is in the natureof governments to be nosy . " " Do n't worry , " Falkayn advised . " I 'm sure you 'll be accepted for what you are , and accorded more rank than you maybe want . Nor will we ask any treachery of you . At this minute I 'm not sure what we will ask . Maybe only that you use the influence you 're going to have -- a popular hero , granted special status and so forth  --  your influence to get us back some mobility . I believe if you think over what we 've done in the past , you 'll agree we are n't such dreadful vil-lains . " The ruiners on Mirkheim . Their high-flying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coya said , " our group may help keep Hermes from becoming a counter in a game . Because Babur and the Commonwealthwo n't fight till one is crushed . That 's hardly possible for them . After they 've traded some blows , they 'll negotiate , with the upper hand in battle being the upper hand at the conference table . Tonight it looks as if that hand will be a Baburite claw  --  because everything we 've learned indicates their force in being is at least equal to the Commonwealth 's , and their lines of communication are short where its are long . For the sake of an annual quota of supermetals , the Commonwealth might well agree to let Hermes remain a **25;4560;TOOLONG . Certainly the liberation of your planet is not its prime objective . " Lorna . The home we mean to have . " What I would like to do , " van Rijn came in , " is send messages to the heads of independent companies , get them together for some kind of joint action . Right now they got no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves . If you can arrange for people of ours to go off to them , that will be a real coup de going . " " Coup de main , " Coya corrected under her breath . " I think . " Van Rijn lifted the akvavit bottle . " Better let me pour you a buckshot more , my son , " he invited . " This will be a long night . " Eric accepted , tossed off the fiery swallow , and said , before he should lose all heart for the task : " Yes , we 've much to tell , much to talk over , but first  --  This did n't get into the news , as far as I 'm aware , nobody mentioned it while my men and I were being interviewed , because we 'd agreed en route to avoid naming names as much as possible for fear of provoking reprisals at home , but  --  You recall we lost our battleship on the way out . Well , its commander was Michael Falkayn . I understand he was your brother , Captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seized his arm . " I 'm sorry . " Eric 's tone stumbled . " He was a gallant officer . " " Mike  --  " Falkayn shook his head . " Excuse me . " " Oh , darling , darling , " Coya whispered . Falkayn 's fist smote the tabletop , once . Then he blinked hard , sought van Rijn 's eyes , and met them unwaveringly . " You realize what this means , do n't you , Gunung Tuan ? " he asked , flat-voiced . " I 'm the new head of the family and president of the domain . That 's where my first duty lies . " The telephone image of Irwin Milner said : " Greeting , Your Grace . I hope you are well . " Like death and hell you do , Sandra thought . She jerked a nod in reply , but could not bring herself to wish good health to the commanderof planet-based Baburite occupation forces.  |p115Did  he stiffen the least bit ? She watched his features more narrowly . He was a squat redhead whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among his troops . Born on Earth , he retained an accent in his Anglic that she had been told was North American . He was naturalized on Germania , he said ; it was a faraway neutral , hence his service with Babur did not make him guilty of any treason . So he claims . " What did you wish to discuss , General ? " she demanded rather than inquired . " A necessary change , " he replied . " To date , we 've been busy gettingthe protectorate functional , the military side of it , that is . " Warcraft in orbit , whose crews are more alien to man than a shark or a nightshade , ready to hurl their nuclear weapons downward . On the ground , oxygen-breathing mercenaries , human , Merseian , Gorzuni , Donarrian  --  adventurers , the , scourings of space , though thus far they 've stayed disciplined . Not that we see much of them . They have taken over our abandoned navy facilities , plus the Hotel Zeus and a few other buildings roundabout in Starfall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all the inhabited parts of Hermes . He has given me no satisfactory answer as to why , when it would seem that those circling spacecraft are ample to assure our meek behavior . " That work will go on , " Milner continued . " But we 're now ready to start making a sound , uh , infrastructure . I 'm sure your people understandthey ca n't have our protection for nothing . They 'll need to do their share , producing supplies in their factories , food and raw materials from their lands  --  you see what I mean , I 'm sure , madame . " He scowled . " I told you before , the attack those Hermetian ships made on ours , their defiance of orders . . . Yes , yes , not your fault , madame . But if your navy had that many subversives in it , what about civilians ? We might start getting sabotage , espionage , aid and comfort to enemy agents . That has to be guarded against , does n't it ? " He paused . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounded remote in her ears . She was tensing to receive a blow . The first several days of the occupation had gone with eerie smoothness . Were the people stunned , mechanically tracing out routines  --  orhow much ordinary life went on , education , recreation , lovemaking , even laughter ? She herself had been astonished to find she could still enjoy a meal , be concerned when her favorite horse developed a limp , take interest in some unusual triviality on the newscast . Of course , no doubt it helped that few dwellers on the planet had glimpsed an invader . And she liked to think that her speeches hadp116had their effect  --  first , on a conference hookup , to the world legislature , the presidents of the domains ; afterward on television to everybody . " We have no other choice but our users deaths and our children 's . . . . We yield under protest , praying for eventual justice . . . . Our forebears entered wildernesses whose very life forms were mostly unknown to them , and many suffered or died , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we must be worthy of them . . . . Prudence . . . . Patience . . . . Endure . . . . " " We 'll have to organize for the long pull , " Milner told her . " Now I 'm a plain soldier . I do n't know the ins and outs of your society here . But I do know there is n't another like it anywhere that humans have settled . So we 're bringing in a High Commissioner . He and his staff will work closely with you , to ease the , uh , transition and make what reforms are required . He 's Hermetian born , you see , madame , Benoni Strang by name . " Strang ? Not one of the Thousand Families . Possibly a Follower , but I doubt it ; I 'm sure I 'd remember . Then he must be " He arrived today and would like to meet with you informally as soon as possible , " Milner was saying . " You know , get acquainted , let you see that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at heart . When would be a convenient time , madame ? " They are very polite to the prisoners , not ? Waiting , she wandered alone save for one of her hounds , across the top of Pilgrim Hill to the Old Keep . Its stone massiveness housed nothing these days but records and a museum ; nobody else was in the formal gardens surrounding it . The stillness made her footsteps seem loud on the graveled paths . Flowerbeds and low hedges formed an intricate design anchored to occasional trees . Most blooms were gone ; colors other than green were only in crimson daleflower and small whitefoot , in shrubs where skyberries ripened vivid blue , in the first yellow on leaves of birch and purple on leaves of fallaron . Mala shone muted through a hazy sky . The air was mild , with a slight tang . Trekking wings passed overhead . Autumn is gentle around Starfall , despite its latitude ; Hermes tilts less on its axis than Earth . Under the hill gleamed the river , the city stretched eastward in roofs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plowland and pasture and Cloudhelm 's ghostly peak . She saw little traffic and heard none . The world might have been keeping a Sabbath . But nothing ever really stopped work , least of all the forces of disruption . Soon she must go back inside and haggle for the liberties ofp117her people . She remembered that it had been just this season and just this weather when she and Pete rode into the trouble at Whistle Creek . Pete  --  Her mind flew back across twenty-two Hermetian years . This was awhile after they met . That hour was still in the future when he would ask for marriage , or she would . ( They were never quite sure which . ) They were , though , seeing a good deal of each other . He had suggested she join him for some outdoor sport . She left Eric in her mother 's care and flitted northeast from Windy Rim , across the Apollo Valley , to Brightwater in the foothills of the ThunderheadMountains . It did not belong to him . The Asmundsens were Followers of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as on the coastal plain and elsewhere . However , the Asmundsens had been tenants of the estate called Brightwater for generations , managers of the copper mining and refining which were the area 's sole industry . Pete was content to let his older brother handle that , while he went into business for himself , exploring the planets of the Maian System and developing their resources . ( Naturally the domain took a share of the profits ; but then , it had put up the original investment , after he persuaded the president and advisors that his idea was sound . ) The family made Sandra welcome , at first with the formalities due a person of her rank , but soon warmly and merrily . Having seen different cultures in her travels , she noticed what she would earlier have taken for granted , the absolute lack of subservience . If they had by birthright a single vote each in domain affairs while every adult Runeberg had ten , what of it ? Their rights were equally inviolable ; they enjoyed hereditary privileges , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tedious detail work vis-a-vis neighbor domains ; if any of them came to grief , it was the duty of the presidential bloodline to mobilize what resources were necessary to help . Indeed , they stood to the Runebergs much as the Runebergs stood to whateverhead of state the legislature elected from the Tamarins . Her awareness growing keener as time passed , Sandra often wondered whether she envied more the Kindred or the Followers . On the day that she was to recall long afterward , she and Pete took horse for a ride to Whistle Creek , the industrial community . There they would visit the plant and have a late lunch before turning back . The route was lovely , a trail along ridges and down into vales whose forests were beginning to add gold , bronze , turquoise , amethyst , silver to their green , along hasty brooks , across meadows whichp118had heaven for a roof . Mostly they rode in a silence that was more than companionable . But for an hour Pete unburdened himself to her of certain cares . Grand Duke Robert , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on interplanetary development questions , then lately was progressing to a variety of matters . Pete did not want to become a gray eminence . Sandra did her awkward best to assure him that he was simply a valuable counselor . Inwardly she thought that if somehow she should be chosen successor , he never would escape the role . They entered the town in a step , for it had no agricultural hinterlandor suburbs . A single paved road to the mine served it ; otherwisetraffic went by air . Its core was the sleek , largely automated refinery , carefully designed to spare the environment . Round about clustered the shops , homes , and public buildings of a few thousand inhabitants . The streets smelled of woods . Today they were strangely empty . " What 's going on ? " Pete asked , and sent his horse clopping ahead . Presently a human noise became audible , the fitful shouting of a crowd . Heading in that direction , the riders rounded a corner and found a small park . Three or four hundredfolk stood in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showing them to be Travers who worked here . Shoulder patches identified Runeberg Followers ; these kept apart from the rest and looked unhappy . Followers , too , were the police at the corners of the park . Evidently a disturbance was considered possible . This was near the end of the midday break . Obviously the meeting would continue into working hours , and the management had decided not to make an issue of that . The arrangers had timed themselves shrewdly ; Pete 's brother was absent , overseeing the start of a new mine . A woman stood on the bed of a truck which had set down on the yerb and spoke into an amplifier mike . From newscasts seen at Windy Rim , Sandra recognized her wiry figure , intense dark features , military-style slacksuit  --  Christa Broderick , Traver born but heiress of a fortune made by her sea-ranching parents . Her words stormed forth. "  --  overdue to end the reign of the Thousand Families and their lackeys . What are the domains but closed corporations , whose shares are required by self-serving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those corporations , ever , but the outfits which happened to come here first , and so seized the choicest lands of an entire planet ? What was the Declaration of Independence but an attempt to escape the democratization that was stirring in the Commonwealth ,  |p119an  attempt to perpetuate an aristocracy which even stole a medieval title for its new head of state ? " And what are you , the Travers , but workers and businesspeople , excluded from inherited privilege , denied any vote , who nevertheless provide the energy that drives what progress Hermes is making ? What are you but the fraction of its population which is not caught in a web of custom and superstition , the part whose vitality would haul this stagnant world into the modern age and the forefront of tomorrow , were you not shackled hand and foot by the ancestor worshipers ? What are you but a three-fifths majority ? " Oh , the feudalists are clever , I admit . They hire you , they buy from you and sell to you , they leave your private lives alone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above all they exempt you from taxation . I have heard many a Traver say that he or she is quite happy with things as they are . But ask yourselves : Is this not a subtle slavery in itself ? Are you not being denied the right to tax yourselves for public purposes chosen by your democratically elected representatives ? Are you content with the do-nothing governmentof a decadent aristocracy , or would you rather bequeath to your children a state  --  yes , I will say a commonwealth  --  to which everything is possible ? Answer me ! " A part of the listeners cheered , a part booed , most stood in troubledmuteness . Never before had the Liberation Front sent a speaker  --  its leader , at that  --  to Whistle Creek . Of course , Sandra realized , those here would have seen rallies and heard speeches made elsewhere , on their telescreens ; some would have read the literature ; a few might have dropped in on movement headquarters in Starfall . But she felt with shocking suddenness that there was nothing as powerful as a meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packed close to body . Then the ancient ape awoke . Briefly , sardonically went through her the thought that perhaps this was why Kindred and Followerswent in for so much pageantry . Turning her head , Broderick saw her and Pete in their saddles . They had each gotten a certain amount of publicity ; she knew them by sight . At once she pounced . Yet her sarcasm was delicate . " Well , greeting ! All of you , look who 've come . Peter Asmundsen , brother of your general manager ; Sandra Tamarin , possibly your next Grand Duchess . Sir , madame "  --  and that second title reminded those who knew of Eric that he might in his turn bring foreign blood to the throne  --  " I hope I 've not given offense in proposing some reforms . " " No , no , " Pete called . " Sail right ahead . "  | " Perhaps you would like to reply ? " " ' T is your speech . " Chuckles came from the Followers and half the Travers . Broderick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were beginning to glance at their watches ; most of them were skilled technicians who could not be absent too long without problems developing in their departments . She would have to start fresh to rearouse interest . " I 'm glad you 're here , " she said . " Very few of your class can be bothered to debate the issues the Liberation Front is raising . Thank you for showing public spirit . . . . Do you wish to respond ? " Expectant gazes turned toward the pair . Dismayed , Sandra felt her tongue lock tight . The sky pressed down on her . Then Pete brought his horse forward a pace , sat there with light shining on his blond mane and in his blue eyes , and said in a deep drawl that carried from end to end of the park : " Well , thank you , but we 're only visiting . Anybody interested in a thorough discussion of the pros and cons of this subject should fax the Quadro twelfth issue of the Starfall Weekly Meteor . After that , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what have you . " I might say this , for whatever ' t is worth . I do n't think democracy , or aristocracy , or any other political arrangement should be an end in itself . Such things are simply means to an end , not ? All right , then ask yourselves if what we 've got is n't at least serving the end of keepingHermes a pleasant place to live . " If you 're feeling restless  --  well , belike most of you know I 'm in charge of an effort to exploit the other planets , instead of overexploitingthis one we inhabit . ' T is tough and often dangerous work , but if you live , you 've a goodly chance of getting rich , and are bound to have the satisfaction of knowing you did what not many persons could have done . We 're chronically short of labor . I 'll be delighted if you mail me your applications . " He paused . " My brother will be less delighted . " Carry on , " he said into their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having skipped lunch they were riding back through the woods , he apologized : " I 'm sorry . We 'll have to try another time . I 'd no idea this would happen . " " I 'm glad it did , " she answered . " It was interesting . No , more than that . " I learned a little something , Sandra Tamarin-Asmundsen remembered . Including , maybe then , maybe a bit later , that I loved you , Pete.  |p121During  the years between , the Liberation Front had gained strength . Much of her reign had gone into a search for compromises . Principally , Travers now had a vote in choosing municipal officers . Broderick and her kind were still maintaining that this was a mere sop ; and they seemed to make ever more converts . What will Benoni Strang be like ? Received in her confidential conference room , he proved a surprise . Medium-sized , slim , the rather handsome features of his rectangularface ornamented by a neat mustache and a suntan , his slightly grizzled brown hair sleeked back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were of rich material , soft in hue but cut in the latest Terrestrialmode . He bowed to her as courtesy required a Traver do . ( A member of the Kindred would have shaken hands with the Duchess , a Follower would have saluted . ) " Good greeting , Your Grace . I thank you for the honor you do me . " The words were traditional , though Hermetian intonation had worn away . He must have spent long years separated from the Strangs whom a city directory listed as being of his class . Her throat tightened as if to keep her heart from jumping out . Traitor , traitor . Barely could she make herself say , " Be seated " and take her own carven armchair . He obeyed . " It 's a wonderful feeling to be back , madame . I 'd well-nigh forgotten how beautiful this area is . " " Where else were you ? " I must find out everything about him I can . For this purpose , I may have to smile at him . " Many places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glad to reminisceif you wish . However , I suspect today you 'd rather get straight to the point . " " Yes . Why are you working for the Baburites ? " " I 'm not really , madame . I hope to do my best for Hermes . It was not always kind to me , but it is the world of my fathers . " " Invaded ! " Strang frowned , as if wounded . " I sympathize with your distress , madame . But Babur was forestalling the Commonwealth . Intelligence discovered that the general staff of the enemy had a plan , the preliminariesalready in train , to take over this system . " So you say , Sandra thought . Yet she could not help wondering . " You can hardly blame Babur for acting , " Strang continued . " And from your viewpoint , is n't it the lesser of two evils ? It does n't want to rule you ; could n't possibly ; the idea is ridiculous . At most , some kind of postwar association for mutual defense and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deplored the fact that severalcolonies broke loose from it . " True enough . Our forebears did because they were evolving societies , interests , philosophies in their new homes , too strange to Earth , Luna , or Venus to fit in well with laws and usages developed for those worlds . The Commonwealth did n't resist independence by force of arms . But many of its citizens believed that it ought to . " Madame , " Strang said earnestly , " I 've been a xenologist , specializing in subjovian planets and Babur in particular . I know that race and its different cultures better than any other human . No boast , a plain statement of fact . In addition , as I said , I 'm a Hermetian , yes , a Hermetian patriot . God knows I 'm not perfect . But I do think I 'm the realistic choice for High Commissioner . That 's why I volunteered my services . " " Not on any quick impulse , " Sandra scoffed . " This whole operationmust have been planned far ahead . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . Since I was a boy here in Starfall , I was conscious of things deeply wrong , and thinking how the wrong might be set right . " Fear brushed Sandra and made her snap , " I 've lost more time out of my own life than I like to reckon up , listening to the self-pity of the Liberation Front . What 's your tale ? " Cold anger flared back at her : " If you have n't understood yet , probably you never will . Have you no imagination ? Think of yourself as a child , crowded into a public school while Kindred children were getting individual tutoring from the finest teachers on the planet . Think of having dreams of accomplishment , of becoming somebody whose name will survive , and then finding that all the land worth having , all the resources , all the key businesses belong to the domains  --  to the Kindred and their Followers  --  who stifle every chance for a change because it might upset their privileges and make them use their brains . Think of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to , till her parents stepped in because a Traver son-in-law would hurt their social standing , would keep them from using her to make a fat alliance  --  " Strang broke off . Silence filled the room for half a minute . Thereafterhe spoke calmly . " Madame , quite aside from justice , Hermes must be reorganized so it can aid in its own defense . This archaic half-feudal society is flat-out too cumbersome , too unproductive . . . most important , too alienating . The naval mutiny and flight to Earth showed that not even your government is safe from the insolence and insubordination of anp123officer corps drawn from the aristocrats . You have to win the loyalty of the Traver majority for practical as well as for moral reasons . But why should it care what becomes of Kindred and Followers ? What stake has it in the planet as a whole ? Production can no longer be divided among domains . It has to be integrated on a global scale . So do distribution , courts , police , education , welfare , everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In their place , we need the entirepopulace . " And after the war  --  it 'll be an altogether new universe . The PolesotechnicLeague wo n't be dominant anymore . The Commonwealth wo n't be the most powerful state . Leisured negotiation wo n't be the single way of settling disputes between nations and races . Hermes will have to adapt or go under . I want the adaptation to start immediately . " We 're going to have a revolution here , madame . I hope you and your upper classes will willingly assist it . But be that as it may , the revolution is going to happen . " Hanny Lennart , serving the Commonwealth at a credit a year as Special Assistant Minister of Extrasolar Relations , declared across a continent and an ocean : " You appreciate what a difficult position your coming has put us into , Admiral Tamarin-Asmundsen . We welcomeyour offer to join your strength to ours . However , you admit that your government , which we still recognize , did not order you here . " " I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the phone as dryly as he was able . Within him raged , Will you say something real , you mummy ? She did , and the end of suspense almost kicked the wind out of him . " I am calling informally to let you know without delay that I 've decided to support the position taken by your ambassador . That is , the Hermetian government is under duress and therefore only those of its agents who are at large can properly represent it . I expect this will get Cabinet approval . " " Thank you . . . much , " he breathed.  | " It will take at least a month , " she warned . " The Cabinet has a host of urgent problems . There 's no hurry about your case , because our fleet wo n't move till it has reasonably good intelligence of Baburiteforces and their dispositions . We do n't want a second Mirk-heim ! " " According to the news , " Eric ventured , " quite a lot of your citizensdo n't want the fleet to move at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's sparse brows drew together . " Yes , the fools . That 's the softest name I can give them  --  fools . " She grew brisk again . " Pending acceptance of my proposal concerning you , I have the authority and obligation to rule on your temporary status . Frankly , I 'm puzzled why Ambassador Runeberg objects so hard to your being considered internees . It 's a mere formality for a short period . " Nicholas van Rijn put him up to it , that 's why . The knowledge surged through Eric that he was winning this round . But it was n't over yet and the fight had many more to go . His mind and tongue began working at full speed . " I 'm sure he 's explained to you , Freelady . We will be answerable to our government after the war . Accepting internment would imply that its status was dubious . Nor can we put ourselves under your command till we 're fully recognized as allies . " Lennart compressed her lips . " Someday I must study your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . I trust you 're willing to commenceunofficially developing plans with us for integrating your flotilla with our navy ? " " Our fleet with yours , if you please , Freelady . " The tide of confidence rose in Eric . " Yes , certainly , save when I 'm looking after the well-being of my men . And about them , they 've been effectively interned already . That has to stop . I want a written statement that they 're free to travel around on any innocent errands they may have . " The discussion that followed took less time than he had expected . Lennart yielded to his demands . After all , they appeared minor . And the Commonwealth government was new to the business of war , unsurehow best to handle its own citizens . It would not gratuitously insultthe Hermetian popular heroes of the day . Van Rijn 's publicists had done their job well . In the end , Eric switched off , leaned back , and gusted a sigh which turned into an oath . His look roved from the screen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond which green meadows tilted up toward snows and the sheen of a glacier . His new lodging and head/quarters was a chalet in the Southern Alps of New Zealand , into which communication and data equipment had hastily been moved . Given a few precautions , it was spyproof and bugproof . The wealthy " sympathizer " who lent it was a dummy of van Rijn 's . His elation receded before a wave of anger . Haggling , he thought . Scheming . Waiting . Waiting . When do we fight , for God 's sake ? For Lorna 's sake . The vision of his betrothed rose before him , sharper than any electronic ghost but powerless to speak . Two hundredand twenty-odd light-years beyond this bland sky , she dwelt beneath the guns of Babur , and he had had no chance to kiss her farewell . A pen snapped between his fingers . Van Rijn came in from the next room , where he had been listening . " We got what we was after , ha ? " His tone was unlightened by the minikin victory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the air , except my heart is not in it . We still need to move fast , nie ? Let us right away knock up a plan . " Eric wrenched attention to the merchant . " Oh , I 've done that , " he said . " Ha ? " The little black eyes blinked . " I come so we could be sure we talked safe . " Eric shoved back his frustration . Here was another step he could take toward his desire . " I worked it out while you were on your way . Then Lennart called , as we 'd been hoping , right after you arrived . " You go quietly with your agents to your midocean retreat , Ronga , as if for a few days ' relaxation from the harassment the government'sdoubtless been giving you . " Van Rijn 's mustaches vibrated . " Who told you about there ? " Eric felt progressively better as he spoke . " David Falkayn . Rememberthe night on your yacht , how toward morning , when we seemed pretty well talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fresh air before the car came for me ? He described your various privatelanding facilities , in case of need , and Ronga seems to me like the best bet . " That was n't all he told , he thought . Already then , he knew what he aimed to do and had a fair idea of how to go about it . Today I have been , I still am acting at his behest as much as I am at my own . " Well , now , " he continued into the prawnlike stare , " each of my cruisers carries a speedster  --  outfitted for interstellar travel , I mean . I 'll personally order one down , to land at Ronga . Some Commonwealthnaval functionary will have to grant clearance . I 'm wagering he 'll just retrieve a listing of Ronga as bearing a civilian field suitable for that kind of vessel , and not check any further , like whose prop/erty it is . He wo n't dare to delay me . I 've been acting mighty touchy  --  you noticed how I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to handle me with velvyl waldos . " To avoid phone taps , I suggest you visit my ambassador after you leave here  --  get him out of bed if necessary  --  and hand him my commissionsof your agents as officers of the Hermetian navy . Then bring to the island , and hand to them , my orders that they 're to leave the Solar System according to instructions delivered verbally . They 'll take the speedster after she 's touched down ; you can talk her pilot back to his ship . She carries several weeks ' worth of basic supplies . Can you see to it that the nonhumans have along whatever supplementary nutrientsthey require ? " I do n't imagine the boat will meet any problems getting cleared to lift , either . The person in charge will assume I want to visit my ships in their orbits . But once away from Earth , she 'll head for the deeps . Space is big enough that it 's unlikely she can be intercepted , if your man knows his trade . The Commonwealth navy is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Hermes . " A laugh clanked forth . " Oh , yes , I 'll get any amount of thunder about this , " Eric finished . " I 'll enjoy pointing out that I 've been entirelywithin my rights . We are not interned , and as yet we are not under the Commonwealth supreme command . ' Tis n't my fault if their officer took for granted I wanted a jaunt for myself . I 'm not obliged to explain any orders I issue to personnel of mine  --  though as a matter of fact , ' t is quite reasonable that I 'd send scouts to see from afar , if they can , how Hermes is doing . Yes , the brouhaha should be the first fun I 've had since you smuggled me out of Rio . " Van Rijn stood moveless for seconds . Then : " Oh , ho , ho , ho ! " he bellowed . " You is my son for sure , a chip off the old blockhead , ja , in you the Mendelian excessives is bred true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come with the office gear , and we will drink a wish to the enemy  --  bottoms up ! " " Later , " Eric replied . Warmth touched him . " Yes , I do look forward to getting imperially drunk with you . . . Dad . But right now we 've got to keep moving . I 'll take your word for it that nobody can have traced you to this place . However , if you 're out from under surveillance , if your whereabouts are unknown , for long at a time , it could start the watchers speculating , not ? " He reached for writing materials . " Give me again the names of Falkayn 's partners , " he requested.  |p127Van  Rijn started where he stood . " Falkayn 's ? David ? No , no , boy . I got others standing by . " Eric was surprised . " Of course you 're reluctant to send him back into danger . But have you anybody more competent ? " " No . " Van Rijn began ponderously pacing . " Adz , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she grieves while he is gone . NevertheleastI would send him , except  --  Well , you heard , that night on the boat . He will not go arrange a getting together of the independent company heads like he is supposed to . He does not lie to me about that . Give him a chance , he goes to Hermes . " " Why , yes . Should I object ? " " Tombs and torment ! " van Rijn spluttered . " What can he do there ? Get himself killed ? Then what has all this pile of maneuvers been for ? " " I 'm assuming he did n't boast when he told me , that dawn on your yacht , he and his gang can slip down onto the planet unbeknownst , " Eric said . " Once there , yes , quite likely he will stay for the duration . That 's good from my viewpoint , because his advice and leadership should be valuable . He also said it 'd be harder to get a vessel back into space , but his partners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after they 've left him of . They have a record of such stunts . So they 'll assemble your entrepreneurs for you . Though frankly , I 've no clear idea of what you think those can accomplish . " " Little , maybe , " van Rijn conceded . " And yet . . . I got a hunch on my back , son . It says we should work through what is left of the League , and maybe we find out the reasons for Babur 's actions and how we can change them . Because on the face of it , they make no sense . " He lifted a slab of a hand . " Oh , ja , I know , wars often do not . Still , I wonder and wonder what the Babur leaders imagine they can gain by imperialism against us . " He knuckled his forehead . " Somewhere in this thick old noggin is fizzling an idea . . . . " Davy will insist on going first to Hermes . Then could well be that Adzel and Chee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its spots . Let me send somebody else than them . Please . " That his father should finally use that word to him gave Eric a curiouspang . " I 'm sorry , " he said . " It has to be Falkayn , no matter what terms he sets . You see , I 've got to carry a rose in my tail  --  uh , that 's Hermetian  --  I 've got to guard my rear , legally , for the sake of my own men . Falkayn has my nationality . And his partners do n't belong to the Commonwealth either , do they ? Then I have a right to commission them . Have you any equally qualified spacers on tap that that 's true of ? "  |p128Suddenly  van Rijn looked shrunken . " No , " he whispered . He 's old , passed through Eric , weary , and , here at last , forsaken . He wanted to clasp the bent shoulders . But he could merely say , " Does it make such a difference ? At most , we 'll set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with your colleagues . We hope ' twill prove useful . " He made his next words ring . " The issue , though , will depend on how well we fight . " Van Rijn gave him a long regard . " You do not see , do you , boy ? " he asked , low and harshly . " Win , lose , or draw , much more war means the end of the Commonwealth like we has known it , and the League , and Hermes . You beg the saints we do not have to fight to what we call a decision . " He was mute for a little . " Maybe we is alreadytoo late . Hokay , let us go ahead the way you want . " Burnt orange shading to molten gold and far-flung coral , sunset lay extravagant over the ocean . Light bridged the waters from horizon to surf . High in the west stood Venus . Beneath a lulling of waves , Ronga was wholly quiet . The day 's odors of blossoms were fading away as air cooled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the atoll . On his left a stand of palms glowed against eastern violet . On his right side , the scales shimmered . Chee Lan rode him ; her fur seemed gilded . They were spending their last hour before they returned to space . She said into a silence that had held them both for a while : " After this is done with , if we 're still alive , I 'm going back to Cynthia . For aye . " Adzel rumbled an inquiring sound . " I 've been thinking about it since the trouble began , " she told him  --  or did she tell herself ? " And tonight . . . the beauty here disturbs me . It 's too much like home , and too much unlike . I try to recall the living forests of Dao-lai , malo trees in flower and wings around them , everywhere wings ; but all I see is this . I try to remember folk I care about , and all I have left is their names . It 's a cold way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wealth is sated , " Adzel said . She bristled . " Why in chaos was I confessing to you , you overgrowngruntosaur ? You would n't know what homesickness is . You can pursue your silly enlightenment anywhere you may be , till you 've run the poor thing ragged . " The great head shook ; and that , meaning no , was a gesture learned among humans , not seen in any land on Woden . " I am sorry , Chee . I did not mean to sound smug , simply happy on your account . "  |p129She  calmed as fast as she had flared and gave him a purr . He continueddoggedly , " I thought in my vanity that I was indeed free of birth ties . But this sun is dim , these horizons are narrow , and often in my dreams I gallop again with comrades across a wind-singing plain . And I long for a wife , I who am supposed to have such wishes only when a female is near me in her season . Or is it young that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them up in my arms ? " " Yes , that , " Chee murmured . " A lover I can be kind to , for al-ways . " The beach thinned as it bent around a grove . Passing by , he and she came in sight of Falkayn and Coya , who faced each other with hands joined and had no vision of anything else . Adzel did not slacken his steady pace ; he and his rider neither watched nor averted their eyes . Of three races and one fellowship , these four had little they need conceal between them . " Oh , I regret nothing , " said the Wodenite . " The years have been good . I will but wish my children have the same fortune I did , to fare among miracles . " " I likewise , " Chee answered , " though I 'm afraid  --  I 'm afraid we 've had the best of what there was . The time that is coming  --  " Her voice trailed off . " You are not compelled to endure the future today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final adventure of ours for what it is . " The Cynthian shook herself , as if she had climbed out of a glacial river , and leaped back to her olden style . " Adventure ? " she snarled . " Crammed in a hull half the size of Muddlin ' Through , with none of our pet amusements ? Not even a computer that can play poker ! " At first Hermes was a blue star . It grew to a sapphire disk marbled with white weather , darkened where its single huge continent lay , elsewhere a shining of seas sun-brightened or moon-shimmery . Later it filled half the firmament and was no longer ahead but below . Here was the danger point . Her crew had ridden Streak in on a hyperbolicorbit , entering the Maian System from well off its eclipticp130plane , nuclear power plant shut down and life support apparatus runningat minimum activity off electric capacitors . Thus if any radar from a guardian Baburite ship fingered her , she would most likely be taken for a meteoroid from interstellar space , a fairly common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the atmosphere , Falkayn must briefly apply thrust to give her the precise velocity required . Readouts glided before his eyes , data on air density and its gradient , gravity , altitude , planetary curvature , the boat 's ever-changing vectors . A computation flashed forth : in thirty seconds , aerodynamic descent would be feasible , given the correct amount of deceleration , and would bring the speedster down at such-and-such a point . He must decide whether to take advantage of that opportunity or wait for the next . Then less negagrav force would be needed ; but the hull would grow hotter and the place of landing would be different . Actinghalf on reason , half on trained instinct , he pressed the button which elected the immediate option . With no internal field to compensate , deceleration crammed him forward into his safety web . Weight dragged on his body , darkness went tattered across his vision , thunder sounded through his skull . After minutes the drive cut off and he was flying free on a shallow slant . This high in the stratosphere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Are you all right back there ? " he croaked into the intercom . " As all right as any other squashed tomato , " Chee grumbled from the weapons control turret . " Oh , I found the maneuver quite refreshing , after so long a time weightless , " Adzel said in the engine compartment . " I ca n't wait to disembark and stretch my legs . " Aboard Streak he had had no room for anything except isometric exercises and pushups . He must vacate the recreation chamber , the only one in which he could extend himself , whenever his shipmates wanted a workout  --  either that or risk becoming a backstop for a handball . " You may get in more jogging than you really want , " Chee said dourly . " If somebody 's detector registered our power output . " " We were over the middle of the Corybantic Ocean , " Falkayn reminded her . " The odds should favor us . . . . Whoops , here we start bouncing . " The boat struck the interface of stratosphere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stone skimmed across water , she reboundedfrom the denser gas . Shock drummed through her structure . For a while she flew on , almost free , rising higher toward space , then curving downward to strike and leap again . . . again . . . again.  |p131Each  pass was deeper in the atmosphere , at a lower speed . The sky outside turned blue by day , starry only as she rounded the night side . A wail of cloven air swelled to a hurricane roar . Land and sea began to fill more view than heaven did . At last she was mere kilometers above the surface , acting now as a lifting body . Falkayn tapped a button to demand her geographical coordinates , computed from the continuous signals of navigation satellites . Eagerly he compared a map in his hands . He was over Greatland , bound for a setclown in the Thunderhead Mountains . Below him stretched the sunlit desert of the continental interior , red soil rising in fantastic wind-sculptured yardangs , scantily begrown with yerb , empty of man . If he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So he could use the engine to bring the vessel quite near Hornbeck , ancestral home of the Falkayns . Chee 's voice was a swordcut across his hopes . " Yao leng ! Two aircraftfrom northeast and southeast , converging on our track . " " You sure ? " Falkayn almost shouted . " Radar and . . . yes , by all doom and hell , neutrino emission , nuclearpower plants . I do n't think they 're spaceable , but they 're big , and you can bet they 're well heeled . " Oh , no , oh , no , twisted in Falkayn . We were spotted . How ? Well , the occupation force must be bigger and more dispersed than Eric realized , for whatever reason . After all , he was gone before it took over . . . . Somebody noted an energy burst high up , and queried a centrum which said it probably was nothing Baburite , and a widespreaddetector net got busy , and we were discovered , and the nearest military flyers were scrambled to check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and asked , " Any prospect of shooting them down when they come close ? " " Poor , I 'd say , " Chee replied . Falkayn nodded . Streak was n't Muddlin ' Through . In atmosphere and a strong gravity field , she was much less agile than machines intended for such conditions . She had no forcefield generator capable of stopping a missile , and her unarmored sides were desperately vulnerableto rays . Before she could strike a first-class fighting aircraft , it would likeliest have blown her apart . To attempt a return to space would be as senseless as to try combathere . Tracking devices already had a lock on her . Warcraft in orbit must already have been alerted . The three had discussed this , and every other contingency they could think of , during their voyage . " Okay , " Falkayn said . " Where 'll they meet us , Chee ? "  | " In about another five hundred kilometers , if everybody keeps his present vector , " the Cynthian told him . " Give thanks for so much luck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ section of them that I knew as a boy . I 'll land us short of our destination , and we 'll bolt into the woods . Maybe we can shake pursuit . You two , leave your posts right away ; no further point in your staying on watch . Chee , collect our supplemental rations . " They could all eat most of the native life , but it lacked certain vitamins and trace minerals . " Adzel , get the traveling gear . " A bundle of that had been prepared in advance , including impellers on which they could fly if they did elude enemy search . " Stand by at the personnel lock , but buckle onto stanchions . I 'll be slamming on brakes quite soon . " Trailing a sonic boom that shivered the ground below , Streak continuedher long descent . The mountains reared ghost-blue over the worldrim , then starkly gray and tawny , then beneath the speedster , rock , crags , talus slopes , eternal snows . Peaks raked at her as she crossed their divide . The eastern heights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Valley , beyond which lay the Arcadian Hills , the coastal plain , Starf all , and the Auroral Ocean . In the moister air of this side , clouds drifted , alpine meadows glimmered autumnallypale , the lower slopes lay mantled in forest . Here we go ! Falkayn cut in the drive afresh . With a surge of force , the spaceboat shuddered to a virtual halt , tipped to a vertical position , sank , struck . Her landing jacks bit into topsoil , found solidity , adjusted themselves to hold her steady . By then Falkayn was out of his seat . A dose of equilibrol had compensated his organs of balance for the time under zero gee . He swung himself down a companion , dashed along a corridor , found the airlock open and sped over the gangway after his partners . They gave him the lead . He pelted across the glade where he had settled , toward the trees that walled it . The bare sky bore death . Betweenthe trunks , shrubs and wither grew thick , stiffly resistant . Old skill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movements of arms and shins . Adzel must follow more cautiously , lest he leave a trampled trail ; but each of his strides was longer than the man 's . Chee traveled easily from branch to branch . Falkayn guessed they had gone three kilometers when a whistling sounded overhead . Glancing up , he saw one of the vehicles as it moved toward Streak . The lean shape belonged to an Avelan , producedfor human-occupied planets after the Shenna scare made them arm to some degree , as formidable a war machine as he had feared . The insigne painted upon it was the linked figure eights of unitedp133Babur . It and its like had surely been bought through dummies years ago , and put in care of human mercenaries . Relief fountained in Falkayn when it passed out of sight . It had not spied them . " Let me take a look , " Chee called . Adzel tossed her a pair of binocularsadjustable to her eyes , and she swarmed aloft . Falkayn felt glad of the halt . He was n't yet tired . On a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breathing unduly hard . But this was a chance to let his senses range around , to become part of the world instead of its being a set of obstacles . Late afternoon light speared among boles and boughs from a blue in which small clouds wandered . The trees hereabouts were mainly stonebark , now leafless , and rainroof , whose canopies were gone yellowbut would provide cover if he picked his way with forethought . The forest floor was less overgrown in this area of summer shade than it had been around his landing spot . Its new-fallen cover scrunched beneath his feet , sending up a rich , damp odor . Ornithoids flitted among bare twigs and buzzbugs danced in the sunbeams like dustmotes . A sudden powerful sense of  --  not homecoming  --  longing gripped Falkayn . Was this his country yet , or had he roamed away from it for overly many years ? No time to mope about that . Chee scampered back down . " I saw our bandit descend , and the other 's hovering above , evidently at the boat , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minding that store . " " We had best move fast , " Adzel proposed . " No , " Falkayn decided . " Not till we know how thorough they 're going to be . Let 's get tucked away while we can , especially you , old bulligator . " Chee returned to her post while Adzel squeezed into a thicket . Falkayn used his blaster to slash bushes and boughs , which he laid across the Wodenite 's protruding tail . He himself could more readily hideThe Cynthian zipped to the ground and across it . " School 's out , " she snapped . " They 're coming on impellers , four men flying a search spiral . What d' you bet they 've got a sniffer ? " Falkayn stiffened . Short of a cave , there would be no concealment from an instrument sensitive to the gases of breath and perspiration . Wild animals might cause delays with false alarms , but hardly enough to do the hunted any real good . This could be the end , after all our years of luck . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked , " How would they happen to have a sniffer ? "  | " Precaution against guerrillas , or maybe guerrillas already are active , " Chee said . " Only one of the flyers seems to 've carried any , though . Else they 'd have two parties in motion . " " Could we take to the air ourselves ? " " Chu , no ! Where 've your wits gone ? We 'd be seen for sure , this close to them . " Adzel spoke from the coppice : " I 'll register much the most strongly when they come in range . You two proceed . Let me stay and decoy them . " " Have your brains turned to oatmeal too ? " Chee snorted . " Listen , friends , it is impossible in any event for me to escape  --  " Intelligence slammed back into Falkayn like sword into sheath . " Sunblaze ! " he cried . " Turn that notion inside out . Adzel , you stay put . Chee , come along with me . Guide me on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her ears lifted . " What have you in mind ? " " Hurry , move , you jittertongue ! " Falkayn said . " I 'll explain as we run . " He stood beneath a rainroof at the edge of a stand of stonebark , whose limbs and twigs traced a skeletal pattern across what he could see of the sky . It hummed above him , and his hunters glided into view , well clear of the treetops . They were human but did n't seem so , the impellers on their backs like thick , paired fins , the helmets on their heads like naked bone , metal agleam in the level light . Otherwisethey wore unfamiliar gray uniforms , and three of them carried energy guns whose long barrels bespoke heavy destructive capacity . The leader , who flew lower than the rest , bore a boa with scanners and intake valves on its front , meters on its rear : yes , a sniffer . That man pointed . A bolt raved from the weapon of another , scythingdazzlingly across limbs that fell off and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in accented Anglic : " Come out in sight or we 'll burn the ground you 're on ! " Falkayn stepped forth , empty hands raised . He was beyond fear . But every sense was at its keenest pitch , he saw each separate fallen leaf under his boots , heard it rustle , felt it give beneath his tread , he knew how a breeze whispered the sweat away from his cheeks , he drank fragrances of growth and healthy decay , it felt impossible to him that Chee 's presence did not shout a warning . The soldiers paused . " That 's right , hold where you are , " the voice ordered . The four of them conferred . They would naturally be waryp135of any ambush . However , their instrument had told of just this single man . , , An arboreal animal clinging to a high branch did n't count . It was inconspicuous , its fur gray with black spots , its posture that of a creaturefrozen into terrified immobility . Chee had rolled in the humus below the dead leaves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the planet 's wildlife . Perhaps none of them bad even noticedher . One remained high . His companions came down to take the prisoner . As they passed near the Cynthian , she whipped her blaster from under her belly and opened fire . The first bolt struck the sniffer , slashed through the cover and in among the circuits . He who bore it screamed and let go . The shot trailed across him , searing shut the mortal wound it made . His body continued down on its impeller , brokenly dangling . Her second ray missed . It only got her target on the leg . But that put him out of action . He fled straight up , his own shrieks horrible to hear . The third blazed at Chee . She had already slipped behind the trunk and was on her way groundward , springing from bough to bough across meters of air . He clewed his gun about in search of Falkayn , but Falkayn was back under foliage . Hermetian and Cynthian snapped shots from what shelter they had . The soldier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companion sent flame after flame . Where those struck , wood burst and soil steamed . Hundreds of wings lifted in panic , till cries well-nigh drowned out the flat thunder . It was useless . Slipping from cover to cover , Falkayn was out of that area within seconds . Chee had less trouble moving invisibly . When they rejoined Adzel , she went on high and glimpsed no hostiles , apart from the one aircraft at hover . The mercenaries must have helped their wounded mate back . " And they 'll be without a sniffer till somebody brings a replacement , " Falkayn said . As he had not been afraid earlier , he was not exultant now ; he merely knew what he must do , and momentum carried him headlong . " We 've got to be far gone before then . We 'll start off now , slowly and ultracautiously . Come nightfall , which thank God is soon , we 'll move fast . I mean fast . " To the Wodenite : " Never mind any more noble self-sacrifices , huh ? You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we will have a good speed without needing rest stops . " Yes , he thought , the old team is still working rather well , and pointed to a landmark glimpsed between trees , an unmistakable snowpeak . " Steer yonderward . That way are my people . "  |p136Hornbeck  occupied a plateau jutting from a lower flank of Mount Nivis . North beyond a forest climbed the heights , up to where whitenessforever gleamed . In the west also the horizon was ridged , but to east and south vision met just sky at the end of plowlands . The gray stone manor house stood a little apart from a thorp of lesser dwellingsand other buildings . Here was the origin of the Falkayn domain , in timber and iron ; though its enterprises had since spread planetwide , here was still its heart . Walking along a road that wound among the fields , he saw them empty at this season , stubble and bare brown soil except when cattle in pastures cropped the last Earthside grass which autumn had left . The day was clear , windless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the scrunch of his boots on gravel seemed mysteriously meaningful . Far overhead a steelwing hovered , alert for prey . No cars flew by to trouble it , nor did any move across the ground . The whole settlement had withdrawn : sending few messages to the outside world and those curt ; sending few of its members there and those , closemouthed , on the briefest of errands ; inviting no visitors  --  as if in preparation for onslaught . Which it would soon undergo , in a form more dangerous to it than physical attack , Falkayn thought . He and his mother had come forth , this morning after his arrival , to talk together away from last night 's loving turmoil . But for half an hour they walked speechless . After the years that had passed , he could not be sure what she was thinking . He himself found he could not dwell on plans . His body was too busy remembering . Athena Falkayn finally took the word . She was a tall woman , still handsome and vigorous , white hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she wore a coverall ornamented by the family patch ; but she had added a necklace of fallaron amber . " David , dear , I was too happy to see you again , too horrified at the risks you 've run and then realizing you did come through them safe  --  I could n't say this erenow . Why are you really here ? " " I told you , " he answered.  | " Yes . To take over from Michael , as is your right . " " And my duty . " " No , David . You know better . John and Vicky "  --  her remaining two children , living elsewhere  --  " and their spouses are perfectly competent . For that matter , I was essentially in charge after your father died , Michael being away so much with his naval work . Or have you grown so foreign to us that you do n't believe we can cope ? " Falkayn winced and rubbed his face . It was gaunt from days of hard traveling , living off the country ; his party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replied . " But with my , well , my experience  --  " " Could you not have applied that more usefully in space , helping organize the war effort ? " The glance she sent on high , where ships patrolled , was like a shaken fist . " I doubt it , " he said roughly . " Do you suppose the Commonwealthgovernment would have any part of me ? As for van Rijn  --  well , maybe I 've made a bad mistake . Or maybe not . But . . . look , Hermes has always been at peace . The rough and tumble of history is unreal to you  --  to everybody living on this planet  --  no more than a set of names and dates we learn as children , and forget afterward because they mean nothing to us . I , though , I 've seen war , tyranny , conquest , upheaval , among scores of races . It made me visit sites onEarth , from Jericho and Thermopylae to Hiroshima and Vladivostok , only there were more of them in between than anybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about how these horrors work . Not much  --  the League 's got plenty of people as well informed as I am or better  --  but I can claim more understanding than most Hermetians . " He gripped her arm . " Before I go on , please let some air into this vacuum I 've been talking in , " he craved . " Tell me what the situation is . I heard mention of a social revolution sponsored by the occupation authorities , but no details . Everybody yesterday was excited and  --  Lord , it did get to be one hooraw of a sentimental occasion , did n't it ? Plus the cursing of traitors who 've stirred up the Travers . It ca n't be as simple as that . " " No , ' t is not , " Athena agreed . " Maybe you can see a pattern , different from what I fear I see . " " Tell me . " " Well , I 'm a light-year from having all the facts , and I may be shading those I do have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to others , consult news records  --  " " Yes , of course . " Falkayn laughed sadly . " Mother , I 'm fifty years old . Uh , that 's forty-five Hermetian . " Her smile responded in the same mood . " And I ca n't feel , I sup/pose I can believe but I ca n't feel it 's been that long since the doctor laid you down on my stomach and I heard what a fine pair of lungs you had . " They walked on . The road was interrupted by a plank bridge crossing the Hornbeck itself . They halted at the middle and leaned on the rail , looking down through the water to the stones on the bottom which it made ripply . The current clucked . " Well , " she said in a low monotone , " you know the Baburites came into this system and announced we were their protectorate . They meant to take our few warships , but Michael led those out . " Michael , " she said again after a second , in pride and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gauzy wings . " I imagine Lady Sandra needed a moonful of nerve then , " she continued . " The fleet gone , her oldest son with it  --  what an excuse to depose her . She must have stood up to those creatures and made them see that she alone could maintain a government , that otherwise they 'd inherit anarchy on a planet about which they were nigh totally ignorant . Which was true . Her purpose is to save our lives , our way of living , as many and as much as she can . If she has to compromise , well , I at least will thank her for whatever she can keep . " Falkayn nodded . " You 're wise , Mother . Listening to some of those hotheads last night . .. Help me tell them there 's nothing romantic about war and politics . " Athena sent her gaze toward a glacier which gleamed under the snows of Mount Nivis . " Soon afterward , the Baburites brought in **27;4587;TOOLONG , mostly human , " she said . " Happens I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked me to get folk I could trust to make inquiries , since businesses of our domain would inevitably be dealing with the occupiers and Lady Sandra knew I 've always been close to our chief Followers . " The humans and nonhumans are both a motley lot , recruited over a period of years  --  from the broken , the embittered , the greedy , the outlawed , the amoral , the heedless adventurous . " Falkayn nodded . Expanding through space with the speed and blindness of a natural force , Technic civilization had bred many such . " Recruitment alone must have required quite an organization , backed by plenty of resources , " he said . " ' T is plain , " Athena answered . " I suppose their upper-echelon officers knew part of the truth ; but the ranks were n't told . The story they were handed was this : A consortium of investors , who wanted to stay anonymous , was quietly preparing a free-lance army , crack troops who 'd hire out at high prices wherever they might . That mightp139be on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Shenna ; or it might be to assist would-be imperialists venturing outside of known space . There was a strong hint that the Ymirites in particular were interested in that and would find oxygen-breathing auxiliaries useful on smaller worlds  --  for instance , to exact tribute in the form of articles manufactured to order . " Falkayn let a corner of his mouth bend upward . " I almost have to , no , I do have to admire their audacity , " he said . " Ymir was a natural choice , however ; it 's a favorite object of superstition . " Because we know hardly a byte about it , he recalled . Our name for a giant planet , dwarfing Babur , whose inhabitants are traveling and colonizing through space but apparently uninterested in any close contact with us  --  or else have decided we 're too hopelessly alien . " I wonder why you , the League , got no inkling of all that recruitment , " Athena said . " The best estimate I can make , from what reportsof conversations I 've gathered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few kidnapped soldiers  --  some small guerrilla activity has begun , we disown it publicly but word does filter back to us  --  " She drew breath . " Never mind . Mainly , my folk have counted the occupyingtroops as well as possible . They number about a million . Other information suggests that about as many more are being held in reserve . " Falkayn whistled . And yet  --  " It 's quite understandable why no intelligence of it reached us , " he told her . " A couple of million individuals , collected piecemeal in tens of thousands of places on dozens of planets , they do n't amount to a particularly noticeable statistic . Intrigues are forevergoing on anyway . " Maybe agents of one or two companies did get some intimations . But if so , they or their bosses did n't see fit to pass the information on to the rest of us and push for a full investigation . Communication betweenmembers of the League is not what it used to be . " Space is too big , and we too divided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well . The soldiers were warned they 'd be in isolation for years . But the accumulating pay was excellent , and apparently some fairly lavish recreational facilities were provided , everything from beer halls and brothels to multi-sense library service . And of course the planet where they were sent had its natural wonders to explore , grim though ' t was , marginally terrestroid , hot , wet , perpetually clouded . " " Clouds ? " Falkayn said . " Oh , yes . So nobody who was n't cleared for Top Secret could figure out where it is. "  | " Its name among them was Pharaoh . Conveys that aught to you ? " " No . " " Maybe ' t is outside of known space altogether . " " Hm , I doubt that . Explorers keep expanding known space , and might well come upon it . I 'd guess Pharaoh was visited once and is down in the catalogues with a number , not a name , as a not particularlyinteresting globe , compared to most others . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lately it shipped out and found it was working for Babur against the Commonwealth and possibly against the League . Has that shaken morale ? " " I really know not . My folk  --  like all true Hermetians  --  have n't gottenexactly intimate with them . My impression is that most of them still feel entirely confident . If anything , they 're glad to lash out at a Technic civilization that kicked them aside . Surely the Merseians among them are . If any individuals do have qualms , military disciplinekeeps them quiet . That 's a highly disciplined outfit . " Athena bowed her head . " I 'm afraid I ca n't tell you more about them , " she finished . Falkayn laid his hand over hers , where it rested on the rail , and squeezed hard . " Judas priest , Mother , what are you apologizing for ? You 've missed your career . You should 've been in charge of Nick van Rijn 's intelligence corps . " Meanwhile he could not help thinking what an epic the gathering of the host @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Let 's go on , " Athena said . " I need to exercise the misery out of me . " Falkayn flinched as he matched his pace to hers . " Yes , it must be a foretaste of hell , having to sit helpless day after day while  --  Am I correct in thinking the Baburites originally promised no interference in our domestic affairs ? " " More or less . " " And then , once they were firmly based here , they reneged ; and they 've been pouring in additional troops , stationed over the entire planet , to deter revolt . " " Right . They planted a High Commissioner on us who 's going ahead mostly as he pleases . If Lady Sandra gives him not a minimum of cooperation , ' t is plain he 'll depose her and put us completely under martial law . But the poor brave lass stays on , with Christ knows how many struggles , in hopes of preserving some representationfor Kindred , Followers , and loyal Travers . . . some part of our institutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duchess , she does give a certainp141cachet of legitimacy to his decrees . . . . Well , who am I to criticize ? I 'm not there on the throne . Tell me about this High Commissioner . " " Nobody knows much . His name is Benoni Strang . That means naught to you either , not ? Well , he claims being Hermetian , Traver born and raised . I did manage to have birth and school records checked , and they bear that out . Bad experiences early in life seem to have turned him into a revolutionary . But instead of becoming a LiberationFronter , he went offplanet  --  got a scholarship from Galactic Developments to study xenology  --  and nobody here heard a word about him for the next three decades , even his relatives , till suddenly he reappeared among the Baburites . He 's very familiar with them , belike as much as is possible for an oxygen breather . But he 's also been in topflight human circles ; he 's sophisticated . " Falkayn frowned across the fields . A loperjack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furry shape whose freedom was untouched by ships and soldiers . " And he 's taking this chance to get revenge . Or to right old wrongs , he 'd say . Same thing . Does the LiberationFront cheer him on ? " " Not really , " Athena said . " Their leader , Christa Broderick , made a televised speech after the Commissioner proclaimed his intention of putting through basic social reforms . She welcomed that . Quite a few Libbies promptly resigned , declaring they 're Hermetians first . And later , he 's made no effort to enlist her organization as such ; he 's bypassing it entirely . She 's grown resentful . Censorship wo n't allow her to denounce him openly , but her public silence indicates how she now stands . His Traver supporters are moving to form a new parry . " " I 'm not surprised at Strang 's action , " Falkayn observed . " He would n't want a strong native group for an ally . He 'd have to give it a voice , and the voice would n't always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you start by atomizing it . " " He 's said , through the throne , there 'll be a Grand Assembly to draft a new constitution  --  as our present constitution provides for , you know  --  as soon as suitable procedures for the election of delegates can be set up . " " Ye-ih . That means as soon as he can rig it , without being too blatantabout the fact that everything 's happening under Baburite missile launchers . Do you know what changes he plans to make ? " " Naught 's been definitely promised yet save an end to special privilege . ' But we 're hearing so much about one proposal ' that I 'm sure ' t is scheduled to be enacted . The domains will be democratized ' and will conduct all their operations through a central trade au-thority. "  | " A good , solid basis for a totalitarian state , " Falkayn said . " Mother , I did do right to come back . " She regarded him for a while before she asked , " What do you in-tend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think a lot before I can get specific , " he replied . " Basically , though , I 'll take over the presidency of this domainas I 'm entitled to , and then organize resistance among the rest . " Appalled , she protested , " You 'll be jailed the minute you reveal yourself ! " " Will I ? Unlikely . I 'll come onstage with fanfare . What have I done that was illegal ? Nobody can prove how or when I arrived here . I could have been meditating in a backcountry hermitage since before the war . And . . . the Shenna episode made me a standard-model hero . Never mind modesty  --  the fact has often been a damned nuisance  --  buta fact it is . If Strang 's proceeding as warily as you tell , he wo n't move against me without gross provocation , which I wo n't give . I believe I can rally the Kindred and Followers , get them out of their demoralization , and appeal also to plenty of Travers . When the Grand Assembly is called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not much , but some . We may at least be able to preserve elementary civil liberties , and keep Hermes enough of a symbol of that that the Commonwealthca n't bargain us away . " " I 'm afraid you 're overoptimistic , David , " Athena warned . " I know I am , " he answered grayly . " At best , I 'll hate the next few years , or however long the war lasts  --  separated from Coya and our kids , with the same emptiness in their lives " But I 've got to try , do n't I ? We can only lose all hope by giving up all hope . " Falkayn had left Adzel and Chee in the woods before he hiked the last several kilometers to the manor . Among his earliest concerns was to get them safely tucked away without too many people learning about them , even at Hornbeck . Athena had been able to arrange it immediately . When the Baburitesmade known their intention to occupy , Duchess Sandra had distributed among trustworthy households those Supermetals personnelshe had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the ground operations chief . She sent him to a hunting lodge off in the wilderness . None but she and a few ultratrusted underlingswho brought him his necessities knew he was there . He was delighted when the Wodenite and the Cynthian were guided  --  on their impellers , after dark  --  to keep him company.  |p143In  the morning , the three of them settled down for intensive talk . Kittredge sat on the porch of the log cabin , Chee perched on a chair beside his , Adzel lay at ease on the ground outside with his head rearing above the rail . Sunlight streamed past surrounding trees , turningvivid what leaves remained , yellow , russet , white , blue . Animal life made occasional remote drummings and flutings that drifted through speckled shadows . Otherwise the air was quiet , pungent , a little chilly . " Books , music tapes , television , " Kittredge said . " Chatter wheneversomebody brought me more grub . It got lonesome . Worse , it got boring . I 've caught myself wishing something would happen , anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take recreation in the forest ? " Adzel asked . " I 've never dared go far . I might get lost , or come to grief in a hundredunpredictable ways . This planet is too unlike mine . " Chee flicked ashes off her cigarette at the end of its holder . " Vixen has a human-habitable hemisphere , " she said , " including wood-lands . " " But not like these , except in superficial appearance , " Kittredge replied . " Hell , you know that , as many worlds as you 've seen . " Wistfully : " Me , I 'd settle for just seeing Vixen again , and never stirring my butt off it anymore . " " Nor the rest of you , I presume , " Chee muttered . " I sympathize , " Adzel said gently . " Home is home , no matter how stern . " " Vixen 's a better place to live than it was , " Kittredge said with an upsurge of pride . " Our share in Supermetals has paid for founding a net of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , we 've gained that much , whatever becomes of Mirkheim in the future . " Chee stirred restlessly . " It may make a difference in determining what gets done with Mirkheim if Adzel and I can continue our mission , " she declared . " Have you any notion of how we might get a ship ? " Kittredge shrugged . " Sorry , none . No doubt it 'll depend on how things are going elsewhere . " " You must have some idea about that , " Adzel urged . " You 've spent considerable time here watching broadcasts , and must also have talked to Hermetians at length viva voce . " Kittredge raised his brows . " Talked how ? " " Never mind him , " Chee advised . " He gets that way occa-sionally. "  | " Well , I 'm a total foreigner to this planet , " Kittredge said . " And you two , what do you know about it , starting with its type of so-ciety ? " " A fair amount , " Adzel assured him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over . He had to . " " Yes , I suppose he would , " Kittredge said compassionately . " Well , then , as near as I can discover , the Baburites , through their human honcho , intend to mount a revolution on Hermes  --  from the top , though doubtless they expect to get support from the bottom . The whole scheme of law and property is to be revised , the aristocracy abolished , a participatory republic ' established , whatever that means . " Adzel straightened his neck and Chee sat stiffly upright with her whiskers dithering . " Chu-wai ? " she exclaimed . " Why in cosmos would the Baburites care what kind of government Hermes has , as long as they 're in control ? " " I think they intend to stay in control , " Kittredge answered . " Also after the war  --  for which purpose they 'll have to have a pro-Babur nativeregime , since otherwise too much of their strength would be tied down here . " He tugged his chin . " I figure this takeover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing the same thing . " " Which was a poison-blooded lie from the first , " Chee snapped . " The Commonwealth never had any such intention , and the Baburitesca n't be too stupid to know that . " " Are you sure ? " " Quite sure . Van Rijn would have gotten at least an intimation , and told us . Besides , we come straight from the Solar System . We 've seen what disarray the war effort is in , there  --  military unpreparedness , political uproar , a substantial party howling in terror for peace at whatever cost . . . The Commonwealth is not and never has been in shape to practice imperialism . " " Then why in the name of all that 's crazy did the Baburites invade Hermes ? And why do they want to keep it in the empire they 'd build around Mirkheim ? " " That is a mystery , " Adzel said , " among other mysteries , largest of which is the reason for Babur 's launching a campaign of conquest in the first place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , a sophont species , it can only suffer a net loss by replacing peaceful trade with armed subjugation . Napoleon himself remarked that one can do everything with bayonets except sit on them . Of course , there may be a small dominant class on Babur which stands to make a profit  --  Hro-o-oh ! "  |p145He  bounded to his feet . Chee snatched for the blaster she wore holstered . A car had appeared above the trees . " Easy , easy , " Kittredge laughed , getting up himself . " It 's lugging in extra supplies to feed you two . " Adzel eased . Chee did so more slowly , as she inquired , " Is n't that a bit risky ? An occupation patrol might notice . " " I asked the same question , " Kittredge assured her . " The Lady Falkayn said the family 's always let its servants use this lodge when they 're off duty if it 's not otherwise in demand . Nothing unusual about them flitting here for a few hours . " The car landed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kittredge recoiled . " I do n't know him ! " Chee 's hand snaked toward her gun . " I 'm a friend , " the stranger called . " Lady Athena sent me . I 've brought your food . " He approached , short , stocky , weatherbeaten , plainly clad , with a slightly rolling gait . " My name 's Sam Romney , from Longstrands . " Introductions were made and hands shaken . Kittredge fetched beer and everybody settled down . " I 'm a fisherman , " Romney related . " An independent shipowner , but I 've done most of my business with the Falkayns , we 've gotten pretty close , and in fact , uh , a lad of yours from Mirkheim is currentlybeing supercargo on a herder of mine out at sea . The Hornbeckpantries ca n't supply a bonzer your size , Adzel , not without making a conspicuous hole on the shelves . So last night Lady Athena sent a messenger asking me to come with a lot , explaining roughly how matters stand . She also thinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it might be useful , when nobody knows what 'll happen next , it might be useful for you to have outside contacts . " " Perhaps , " Chee muttered , coiled herself on a cushion , and started a fresh cigarette . Whatever harm had been done , was done . Adzel gave the newcomer a searching look . " Excuse me , " he said , " but are you of the Traver class ? " " Sure am , " Romney replied . " I do not mean to impugn your loyalty , sir , but I had been given to understand that considerable conflict exists on Hermes . " " The Travers on this manor can be trusted , " Kittredge pointed out . " Otherwise I 'd 've been clutched weeks ago . " " Yes , of course , the phenomenon of the faithful retainer is reasonablygeneral , " Adzel said . " And obviously Captain Romney is on our side . I merely wonder how many more like him there are . " The seaman spat . " I do n't know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about having the enemy amongst us , we ca n't speak our minds out loud any longer . But I can tell you this , plenty Travers never swallowed that Liberation Front crock . Like me . I begrudge not the Kindred and the Followers an atom . Their ancestors earned it , and if they maintain it not , they can still lose it , fair and square . Besides , once a government starts dividing property up , where does it stop ? I worked hard for what I have , and I mean for my youngsters to have it after me  --  not a cluttle of zeds who ca n't be bothered to do anything for themselves save fart in unison when their glorious leader says to . " He took out a pipe and tobacco pouch . " Also this , " he continued , " several Libbies have told me , because you know people will talk now and then regardless , confidential-like , several Libbies have told me they 're not happy either . They want not change pushed down everybody'sthroats by those creepie-crawlies ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it makes the whole affair stink worse . And they , the Libbies , that is , they 've not been invited into any conferences . Strang 's given them a glop of praise for the , what 's he say , the noble ideals they 've long upheld  --  ptui !  --  he 's given them a few fine words , like a bone thrown to a yellow dog , but that 's been it . " Having stuffed his pipe , he applied fire before he ended : " Oh , we 've got a fair-sized minority of yellow dogs , who 're overjoyed at the prospects before ' em . I 'll say to her credit , Christa Broderick , the Libbie leader , Christa Broderick 's not among those . But what means that , save that the only thing she has left to lead is a powerless rump of the old organization ? Maybe the Duchess will keep some small voice when the Grand Assembly gathers . But not Broderick , no , not Broderick . " Adzel met Chee 's eyes . " Partner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure that before he reveals himself or does anything else irrevocable , David talks with Lady Sandra . " The image of Benoni Strang stated : " I am calling you about Elvander'sBirthday , madame . "  |p147For  a moment Sandra could not brace herself . She had had to do that too often , until now she sat back and waited in weariness for the next blow . Then thunder resounded outside , she heard anew the trumpet of wind and march of rain , it was as if Pete rode by . She straightened in her chair and replied coldly , " What of it ? The date is still a month off . " " We 're wisest to be beforehand , madame , " Strang said . " My requestis that you announce there will be no public celebrations of the holiday this year , in view of the emergency  --  that demonstrations of any kind are forbidden . " " What ? On our planetary day ? " " Exactly , madame . The danger of emotions avalanching is too great . Citizens may quietly observe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't allow any large private parties either . Churches must be closed . " No real surprise , Sandra thought . Yet her earliest memory was of her father holding her high above a crowd on Riverside Common , to see the fireworks cascade upward off a barge draped in flags . The water was alive with their light . " What if I do n't issue your proclamation ? " she challenged . Strang frowned . " You must , madame . For the sake of your people . Riots , which could lead to actual attempts at overthrow . . . the military would have no choice but to open fire . " He paused . " If you do not issue the order , I will . That would seriously undermine your authority . " What authority ? Nevertheless , this polite , grisly game we play , you and I , is all that postpones  --  what ? " A massacre would lose you much of your support , " she warned . His mouth tightened beneath the neat mustache . " Your use of an emotional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the part of my office , madame . " " Oh , I 'll cancel the festivities . Belike nobody would be in a mood for them anyway . " " Thank you , madame . Ah . . . you will consult with me on the wording , wo n't you ? " " Yes . Good day , Commissioner . " " Good day , Your Grace . " Alone , Sandra rose and sought an open window . She had not turned on fluoros , and the storm made her conference chamber gloomy , a cave wherein only a few visions stood out , shimmer of a polished wood panel , dulled colors of a picture , curve of the Dio/medean battle-ax . Freshness blew in , though , loud and raw . Rain struck the garden like spears and hid sight of the world beyond its wall . Lightning flared , making every bare twig on the shrubs leap forth under a sheet-metal sky ; thunder rolled across unending reaches while murk returned . She would not ride forth today . She had been doing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Riverway , along the Palomino to Silver Street , thence to Olympic Avenue and back , a distance of several kilometers  --  always alone  --  to let the people see her , for whatever comfort that might give on either side . Folk often bowed deeply or kissed their hands to her . But too few would be out in this weather to make the gesture worth the effort . I want to , however , I am parched with wanting . Though not through Starfall . West instead , on Canyon Road into the countryside , at a gallop straight against wind and rain , gallop and gallop without stop , hoofs smashing skulls of Strang and his men , then beyond them into the hills , the mountains , the deserts , a leap off the horizon and out among the stars . A buzzer sounded . She untied her fists , strode to the intercom , and pressed accept . " Yes ? " " Madame , " said the voice of her entrykeeper , " Martin Schuster is waiting to see you . " " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yes . Send him in . " Whoever he is . I know only that Athena Falkayn sent me a messageasking me to receive him in private , which is why I happened to be here when Strang  --  her gullet clenched  --  called . The door opened for him and closed again . He was like her in being tall , blond , and middle-aged . When she looked more closely into the lean countenance , she choked down a cry of startlement and stood rigid . He bowed . " Good greeting , Your Grace . Thank you for receiving me . " He kept a touch of Hermetian accent if not of phrasing , for , as she knew , throughout the years he had not been long at a time on Earth , nor on any other world where Anglic was spoken . " What I have to say is confidential . " " Right . " Her heart fluttered . " This room is spyproofed . " As he hesitated : " Since the occupation , I 've assigned guards and techniciansto full-time duty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Their gazes locked . " I think you know me . " " David Falkayn ? " " Yes . " " Why have you come back ? "  | " To help however I can . I was hoping you , madame , could give me a few ideas about that . " Sandra 's gesture was jagged . " Welcome . Sit . Care you for refreshment , a smoke , aught I can offer ? " " Not now , thank you . " Falkayn remained standing till she had taken her seat . She fumbled forth a cigar from a humidor beside her chair , bit the end off , and started it going . " Tell me your story , " she said . " Eric reached Sol unharmed , " he began , and continued . She seldominterrupted his succinct narrative with questions . When he was through , she shook her head and sighed . " I admire your courage and resource , Captain Falkayn , and maybe you can be of help . That 's dreadfully far from certain , though . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action , buying temporary concessions from Strang with our cooperation in laying the foundations for his eventual dictatorship . Naught can really save Hermes but the defeat of Babur . " " Which will take years if it 's possible at all , and lives and treasure and social disruption beyond reckoning , " he said . " The Commonwealthis confused , dismayed , and lacks will . The League is paralyzed by its own feuds . I think after a while the Commonwealth will fight all-out , largely because the Home Companies want that . They see Mirkheim as their entry into space on a scale that 'll make them competitivewith the Seven . But they ca n't conjure up a determined populaceand a powerful navy overnight . Meanwhile Babur will  --  who can tell what ? Yes , madame , I doubt we on Hermes can count on rescue from abroad . " " What would you advocate , then ? " She drew savagely on her cigar . The smoke bit her tongue . " Political maneuvers , as you 've been carrying out and I may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of armed resistance , to operate out of our enormous hinterlands . We just might make the cost of supporting Strang more than it 's worth to Babur , which has little to gain here . " " Whatever the real reason was for Babur overrunning us , wo n't that continue to obtain ? " she argued against all her dearest wishes . " And never underestimate Strang . He 's surely foreseen that we may try what you suggest , and taken steps . In his evil way  --  not that he sees himself as evil  --  he 's a genius . " Falkayn stared past her , out the rainful window . " You must know him better than anybody else on this planet , " he said . " That 's not well . He 's as dedicated as a machine , and no easier top150get near . I wonder if he ever sleeps . Why , shortly before you came in , he called me personally about banning public events on Elvander 's Birthday . He could have told an aide to make the arrangements , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Falkayn smiled a little . " I must study him , try to get a notion of his style . I 'm told he makes no speeches , and hardly ever delivers a statement in his own name . " " True . He 's no egotist , I must admit . Or . . . rather . . . he 's interested in the substance of power , not the show . " " I do n't even know what he looks like . " " Well , I can play back our conversation . " Sandra was vaguely relieved to rise , walk across to her phone , and punch the button . She was n't sure how to respond to this man , home-born but far-faring , famousbut a stranger , who had come to her out of the storm . The screen lit , the familiar , well-hated features appeared , Strang said , " Good morning , Your Grace  --  " " Yaaah ! " The yell ripped at her eardrums . She whirled and saw Falkayn on his feet , crouched crook-fingered . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a whisper : " Is . " " I am calling you about Elvander 's Birthday , madame , " said the recording . " Turn it off , " Falkayn asked hoarsely . " Judas priest . " He looked around him , as if seeking among the shadows . " What else can I say ? Judas priest . " It was as if a tendril of the lightning ran up Sandra 's spine , but cold , cold . She went stiff-legged back to him . " Tell me , David . " " This  --  " He shook himself violently . " Does Strang have a twin brother , a double , anything of the kind ? " " No . " She halted . " No , I 'm certain not . " He began to pace , hands wrestling behind his back . " A piece of the puzzle , a keystone , an answer ? " he mumbled . " Be quiet . Let me think . " Neither of them noticed his breach of manners . She waited in a chill draught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips shaping unvoiced words or now and then a nonhumanoath . When at last he stopped and regarded her , it was strangely right that he stood beneath the ax . " This is information that has got to get to Earth , " he thrust forth . " To van Rijn . Immediately . And secretly . How can you smuggle a message out ? " She shook her head . " There 's no way . " " There must be . "  | " None . Think you I have not wanted it , have not sat with my officers trying to imagine how we might do it ? This planet is meshed in radar sweeps , detectors , and ships . Your friends could never have gotten off it alive . You reached atmosphere by masking yourself as a meteoroid , yes . But you know what happened after that . And . . meteoroids do n't rise . " Falkayn 's fist smote the wall . " Listen . What I 've learned could determine the whole course of the war . If we get it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacrifice we can make . " She took hold of his arm . " Why ? " He told her . She stood long silent . " You see I do n't have a complete solution to the riddle , " he added . " I 'll leave that for Old Nick to work out . He 's good at such things . I could even be wrong , in which case our effort will have gone for zero . But you see why we must make the effort . Do n't you ? " " Yes . " She nodded blindly . " A wild gamble , though . If aught goes awry , we 've lost more than our lives . " " Of course . Nevertheless , " he hammered , " we must try . No matter how fantastic our scheme , it 's better than nothing . " Surely communication goes back and forth between Strang and the Baburite high command . If we could hijack one of those boats  --  " " Impossible . " Sandra walked from him , back to the window . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheels . Winter was on its way to Starfall . He came up behind her . " You know something , " he accused . " Yes , " she answered beneath the noise , not turning her head . " I do . But oh , God , my people  --  and yours , your mother , brother , sister , spaceship comrades , everybody left behind  --  " It was his turn to fall mute , and afterward to force : " Go on . " " I still have the ducal space-yacht , " she told him , drop by drop , " Strang has more than once suggested I might like to take a cruise to relax . I 've ever answered no . His meaning is obvious . I can flee to Sol . He 'll not oppose that . " " No , he would n't , " Falkayn agreed low . " It 'd give him the perfect excuse to seize total control , with the support of the extremist HermetianLiberation Fronters . Quote , The Grand Duchess , like her son before her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back a foreignforce that will crush our glorious revolution . " " There 'd be no leadership for Kindred , Followers , and loyal Travers . They 'd feel I 'd betrayed them . . . and erelong they could become the subjects of a reign of terror .
