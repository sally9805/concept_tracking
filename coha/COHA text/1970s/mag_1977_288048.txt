Now , drillers can see what 's there <P> No one really knows how much oil and natural gas lie beneath the choppy Atlantic off the U.S. East Coast . But a year ago , some 40 oil companies were willing to pay $1.1 billion just for the right to find out . They bought leases from the Department of the Interior on half a million choice acres of the Baltimore Canyon . The tracts lie 50 to 90 miles off the coast , far enough over the horizon so that drilling rigs would be invisible from the shore ; the main lease area is opposite Atlantic City , N.J. But before drilling could begin , a federal district court voided the lease sales , ruling that Interior had made only a " charade " of complying with environmental requirements . <P> Last week oilmen , who so far have lost $44 million in interest payments on their lease purchases , were back in business . A federal appeals court threw out the lower-court decision , declaring that the lease sales did not breach any environmental law and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oilmen predicted that test drilling might start as soon as year 's end . The decision presumably will also encourage oil companies to bid on leases scheduled for sale early next year on two other geologically promising areas of the outer continental shelf : Georges Bank off Massachusetts and the Southeast Georgia Embayment ( see map ) . <P> With the U.S. now importing nearly half the 17.9 million bbl. of oil it consumes each day , the country needs every drop of crude it can squeeze out of the continental shelf . The Baltimore Canyon is hardly the Alaskan North Slope , * though with anywhere from 10 to 50 multistoried drilling rigs directly employing perhaps as many as 3,600 engineers , roughnecks and other workers , it may begin to look a bit like it . Even if the most optimistic guesstimates of the area 's reserves ( 1.4 billion bbl. of oil and 9.4 trillion cu . ft. of gas ) are correct , exploiting these deposits would enable the U.S. to cut its oil imports by 4% at most . It will take three to six years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depth in the area is a comparatively shallow 600 ft. , the most promising oil-bearing strata are anywhere from 8,000 to 13,000 ft. underground . Meanwhile , opponents of the drilling could try to halt the work by appealing to the U.S. Supreme Court . <P> Such an appeal would not be easy to win . The Carter Administration has been tightening procedures in an effort to eliminate many of the objections that have led environmentalists to oppose offshore drilling . Before the Interior Department will issue commercial drilling permits , it requires all companies that discover offshore oil to file a special environmental-impact statement covering matters like how the oil will be landed ashore . Also , Interior has created a 60-day review period after it announces a decision to offer offshore leases , in order to give states time to judge the impact on their shorelines and forward any objections . Congress is expected to set up a $200 million fund later this year to compensate property owners who suffer from spills , blowouts and other accidents offshore .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
