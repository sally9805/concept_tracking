we begin sweating out the world . Bronstein . On the floor near his head lay all he possessed in it , boots and buckskins , a duffel-bag , and a jacket that by now was both tent and skin . He reached out and patted the computer wall . The one at school , grubbed with handprints , was never like this . Morning , Batface . Remember a guy named Betts ? He named you . Or the likes of you . We three worked together once . Please remember him . And remember Bronstein . Both of you . He pressed his face into the rug again . He still had the kind of red hair that made him a fact in other peoples ' eyes , and the kind of stutter nobody notices . But his own eyes saw so much of late there must be something wrong with them . Yesterday he 'd had a twenty-first birthday party . A year late , but it should last him a lifetime . Both his parents , who gave it , were still around . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see shortly , has the look of a man recently dead . And his mother , whom he suspects he will not see , already the nimbus of the far-distant but recently alive . Beyond that , archives of girls since he was thirteen , but no permanent one . They float through his time like tough ghosts . One in particular , trawling the catchwords he used to grab her for . Pastimes . Past time . Tell me something , Batface . Are there still gentle friends to go to ? Or must I put in more time learning what 's worth murdering for ?  |p11Where  do the people go , when there 's nobody looking at them ? A leg cramp seized him , in the long water-muscles he 'd kept to training-pitch in all the canals of the Low Countries , and the lochs of Britain too . He got up from the floor , hobbling it out . Emplaning did it every time  --  hours with his knees locked like a jumping jack 's . He was too tall ever to be a top swimmer anyway . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spotted last night , he flipped a quart of milk into himself from the one of the fridges , feeling very American for still liking milk , then ducked into a Women 's , the only can he could find , and padded back . One flaw here  --  no pool . If that was the real flaw . The wall lured like a lotus-pond . Ten years back , in a boarding school  --  one , like his swimming , of second rank  --  he and Betts , both from homes where people were silent except when in company , had vowed each to talk aloud to himself when alone , as a form of mind-expansion . His friend reporting success in it , but he never . Contrarily he admired the swimming team 's best , a Norfolk boy who got through the extracurricular world on the one word . " Hahyadoin ' ? " In the mornin ' and the evenin ' . Night before last , in London , he had caught an old samurai flick , locally dubbed , Elizabethan-style . Hahyadoin ' , Bronstein . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall , piano delicate . One should n't leave to touch.  |p12Suddenly   --  he was standing close  --  he stretched himself against the glum metal , arms wide . Laid his head on it . How  --  in what way  --  could you ask the computer to give you back your life ? If properly fed , it could put into motion  --  what you already were . It could give back only the impulses one gave it  --  as if God could become a mechanical bore , with a Horatio Alger countenancethat would n't necessarily shine , but harbored informationlike a grudge . Was n't a god of course , anymore than your own brain was  --  which it fearfully resembled . But if one day you fed it all the clues of meditation that you had with you , the little blurts and jargons that kept you going but hidden , and meant you to yourself like your own vibration in the dark  --  what could happen ? What would come back to you ? A bad poem to which you could claim authorship ? A mumbo jumbo music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his own programming ? Indian war cries , made by American boys on an Italian lake . Or the whoopingcoughsummer when you ranged back and forth like a monkey put out to sun , the smallest dictator in the world , staring down on the people below , the gray west wall of Central Park , and the viaduct entrance that cut east from the Elba of his own fire-escape . That kid , himself in the first habitat he knew , had later on taken a primary course in computers in the tenth grade . No mystery , except of knowing . No rocks changed into feathers , except in the nature of things.  |p13About  the same ethic too ; you could confuddle the other boys or out-equate them , but ended up cheated  --  as in the best bibles  --  if you cheated on yourself . It had been one of the phases of his boyhood that he had passed through , tired of and yet kept a romance of  --  as if he had once owned a bike with a seventh speed on it that went to Samarkand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This set-up belonged to his father . The family computer , though he had never seen it before  --  why should n't it serve him in the person as the other householdmachines would have : washing his shorts , microwavinga steak for his gut , or massaging the inch of maturity that must have fattened on him since last night ? Or like all the new maids of the last few years , who had started up like robots when he walked in on them . It looked like as good a home as any . Jazzy light on the facade and inside , a hoard of secrets you would expect to pay for , in exchange for entering the only orifice where you felt temporarily permanent . Like a cross between a woman and a bank , and inspiring about the same cliches . When he 'd been living in it long enough , it might tell him whether he ought to have called up a girl called Jasmin , or should wait for the stewardess due in on Friday next . When all he wanted was for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and lead him to where his future was indissoluble from his past , friends passing and repassing in a guild he knew . As much ask thatp14geode on the desk there to float in the downtown harbor  --  whichnow that he looked , was checkered with the astral light of all the money around here that was so different from dollarbills . Hit it  --  maybe it would give him a dime . He squatted on his heels . Stayed there sweating , until he heard something . Bald sighs , absent bumpings , from a long way back . Shannon the doorman 's all-day minstrel shuffle , their twin orange heads meeting in the elevator shill-game . Dropped me a coin , boyo , can you find it ? Found it  --  your young eyes are sharp . Crafty pink face above his own , as Shannon palmed it . On bad days the quarter became a penny  --  thief are you ; on good days the penny became a dime . And a Paton-the-back , Eagle Eye , for being half-Irish . He had n't had to touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . There was a terrible fragility about the Bronsteins . That they did n't know of . Their kid did his best to act accordingly . In all the Boy 's Lives of famous men he had ever read , there was this simple beginning , in which the boy was held transparent in the vial of family , to grow . While the life put one foot after another , scattering little grenades of bread that even in the city would one day lead out of the forest , in single file . They all three thought they were leading a linear life . Until Bronstein was eleven , he and his mother andp15father had been living " almost forever "  --  five years  --  in what his mother also described to whomever had n't been there yet , as " a nice old-fashioned apartment-house , one of the oldies off Madison . " Many such people did get there , to one of the Bronstein cocktail parties -- snagged by his mother at the PTA or even the supermarket , and once on a Saturday afternoon in the aisles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mother called " Gormay . " Whenever Maeve felt sad over her age ( which was thirty-six in her conversation and two years more on her driver 's license ) , or because the three of them were without a family circle in the neighborhood , or perhaps if a broken promise from a tailor or a maid had left her standing in the kitchen  --  " high-heeled and pretty as a rose " as old Shannon had once said to her  --  but realizing once again how alone one could be here  --  she went shopping . Whirling on the hat , shoes and bag she had bought last time  --  one had to impress the salesclerks  --  shewould leave in a rush for some cooked-up something she had to have . Until a few years back , Bunty had been part of it , either on those short forays  --  when she returned , larky and undisappointed , to tell his father " there was nothing in the stores , nothing "  --  or those long days when she and he left " before they open " to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the housefurnishings , the modern-design corners , the bathshops , the accessories  --  in any part of the huge , growing storehousep16of his mother 's alarming but fascinating needs . Nowadays when she left like that , casting back at him mournfully , " Ah Bunty , we used to have nice times then , did n't we ? " he saw the dead image of those two , plodding down the aisles . Whole hunks of his childhood had been spent tagging at her hot , absent hand , peeing in ladies ' washrooms , sitting tall at table between packages his mother counted and fondled , while she ordered his creamcheese-and-nut . He already understood though , that a purchase was the most , and innately serious . His first erotic feeling was that he had been born of such a time , in just such a conjunction . " Imaginary errands , Maeve , you live on them , " his father said . Indeed her closets were full of them . If so , could they still be considered imaginary ? Bunty decided against asking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his father , and his looks from her . Both seemed satisfied with the arrangement . He was still uneasy with it . " Maeve MacNeil , secretary , married Buddy Bronstein , her boss , " his father would say , twinkling . " An old New York story . " " He means Abie 's Irish Rose ' , " she answered , smiling . Both of them explained this to him with zest . " But you 're both white , " Bunty said . Sometime after this , they moved east to the Madison Avenue place . He liked them both okay . Loved them apparently , as when the doctor they had begun to call their " family "  |p17one  , after explaining sex to him , which Bunty kindly tolerated , looked up sharp over his really too-much black rims , and said , " Love your folks , Bunty lad ? " , and he had answered surprised , " Why not ? " Pressed , he had said " Sure , " and was released . Telling the last of his West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had folks who suffered from too much neighborhood family  --  Ike had said , wisenheimer , " He only wanted to know whether you 'd had it yet . " Neither he nor Ike had . " Are n't they something ? " , Ike said . The Bronsteins had a new doctor now , on the East Side . He still could n't believe , though , that all these successivepeople could disappear out of a life . Because that was connected with the possibility of people , being lost altogether , to themselves as well . The world rested , an up-side down pyramid , on himself , a reverse Atlas , at the small end . He could n't disappear , because the world would go with him . A fraction . But he in turn was diminished , as those he knew  --  small daily cornerstones  --  wentaway from him . Did n't he vanish , crumb by crumb of him , as they were sucked into the unoccupied space around us , which is wherever we are not ? And ultimately this connected with the disappearance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were presumed to be waiting for resurrection somewhere . He did n't really believe that either ; when you thought of the numbers , of the amount of earth it would take to hold them ,  --  was there enough even if one took in the Tibetan mountains , the Serengeti , the world of ice above Alaska ,  |p18the  Faroe islands  --  all that ? He went to the American Museum of Natural History , studied the fossil stones , and saw how unnatural it would be to expect anything  --  as if souls were like eggs , to be storaged somewhere . Yet he kept firm in his trust that all those he knew , or had known or would ever know , would always have a place , someplace . So since each person must be his kind of pyramid  --  he admitted that  --  maybe everybody , all told and down the ages , did have a place somewhere . Ike , whose grandfather had served in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade and lived to tell of it , had been going to be a military historian . Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 'd expect to be exempted in order to chronicle it , he 'd said shrewdly . Around a corner he used to come yelling  --  " Trapped on the Meuse ! Remember Verdun ! "  --  he preferred wars that were way back . Once in a while , even long after the Bronsteins moved to off Madison , Bunty , yearning a little , could remember his face . Slowly he 'd begun to build up a confidence that one day he would run into Ike again , that some day , in the New York way , he would run into them all . Maeve and Quentin  --  Buddy , like Bunty , was a nickname  --  generallylived with him in the state of equidistance all three felt was normal , and safe . His own reality was like a bubble 's in a pot , always breaking into new bubbles , on the liquid effusion of sunsets and stomach-aches in which he sank at night and next morning rose , withp19all his small wits . He came to know that now and then there was more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested him : how his mother 's was sometimes a woman 's sadness ; his father 's a man 's . How this sadness was sometimes private , sometimes mutual and joined . Usually he stood apart from them at these times because he did n't have it . At first he seemed to himself lower than them , because of his lack ( by this time he took for granted that everybody was trying to find a merit that would justify them for being ) . Gradually he took himself to be higher , or at least out of the circumstances . This happened whenever his parents ' conjoiningmood , flowering like an embrace , hovered over " what it took to live here . " Not only money ; though that of course came into it ; where you lived and how , came in as much . With who and what people were around . This last , rarely said , he would often hear , like the tinny overtones on his father 's old Kranich &; Bach piano , inherited from his boyhood , and the one piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could never hear fully was what they were yearning for , comfortable as they all were , and getting more so . Everything they wanted seemed to be flowing toward them . In his father 's office , ever larger on each state visit , lines of desks were starred with faces Bunty did n't know anymore , or who did n't know him . At home , sofas overflowing with pillows , the beds changed for posture ones , and pictures of a kind he had never seenp20before on his home walls . What was this yearning that went always a little ahead ? Now they had it , now they did n't ; they had some of it , would they get all of it ?  --  their faces said to him as they stood there . Maeve the redhead , with her narrow bones , fine skin and freckled hands whose large joints she complained of , was three inches taller . To Bunt , already taller than both , his father now looked endearingly small and solid , his face cherub-nice , not cherub-nasty  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smart man I ever met , " one of the desks had confided . " Is he ever gon na get places . You watch . " Where ? Though he was involved and grew to know when he was , he was n't the main focus of it or of them ; he could stay subterranean . Or  --  when he felt it did momentarily light on him , like over a school or a Sunday suit  --  scornfully above . Even though he had n't yet identifiedthe nature of this pot of gold that kept them dancing  --  except that it was n't just gold . Probably it was like sex , he decided , staring at them with eyes that were conceded to be Buddy 's , twitching the ears on a head only just darker red than hers , pursing a wider version of her mouth , and squinting through specs with the same correction Buddy had had at his age , and outgrown . And possibly , like sex , once you had it , as Ike had said , you 'd always want it . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a Polish-Hungarian Catholic , and could n't be asked . " Boy , can you pick ' em , " the maid said when hep21brought Zitkower home , the last of five Bunt had been carefully trying out in succession since he 'd switched schools , and the craziest looking . The maid , already onto the standards of the Bronstein house , stuffed them all to the gills with goodies anyway , and Bunt ignored the comment ; he knew certain flaws in her she was n't aware of  --  like those pointy nails and the white-cracker way she had with the cigs  --  and which only he knew had to do with what propelled the Bronsteins , would soon make them give her notice , before he had to go through the pain of finding she had a name and a character he might learn to cherish . His final allegiance had been to a colored girl anyway , Marlene . Real Southern , not Haitian . The last of whom he had been scared of and had caused to vanish , he rather thought , by squinting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bronsteins had begun shakily ascending the ladder of another kind of help altogether , called by the agency " ethnic American , " and so far , no improvement . He was pretty satisfied with Zitkower . Since coming into the new school district , he had had no one . Had to be somebody neither a toady or to be toadied to , brainy but not all bookish , a natural apartment-house kid  --  some of the ones moving in or back from the suburbswere too much , and not a creep  --  like the three in his grade who had just shaved themselves tonsures . Just somebody with a little motherwit , and on roughly the same standing generally . Like Ike . Witold , shortened to Witty , had also just movedp22in from Central Park West . Their rooms had been bigger up there , too , and though their present decor was nothing like the Bronsteins ' , or the maid 's either , but crabbedly middle-Europe on both counts , the food for alternate homework visits was good and plentiful , in that style . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the house upgrade . And about to dislodgeit , though at the Zitkower 's the brains were differentlydivided . Witty 's father , second-in-command of a restaurant and also a wine authority , was already talking of an apartment with a real dining-room , in a tone Bunt recognized . Obscure , and reaching . And sad . " You 'll get it , " Bunt said . Aloud . Surprising himself . " What are you , a magician ? " Mr. Zitkower  --  " Zit "  --  said . " Nah , just an authority on real estate , " Witty had been to Bunt 's room and knew he always saved over the Sunday section and read the listings with a mixture of anticipation and gloom . Mrs. Zit , an interpreter for the UN , was the brainy side , though she spoke suddenly from behind her book  --  and clearly not for the first time , of " moving out . " The suburbs . " I wo n't go , " Witty said . " The kids coming in from there are impossible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large ivory cross , hung on a wire which induced a rash on his neck but which he would n't change , and had just initiated the school to the skinhead style of hair . The cross was a put-on ; he was a regressedp23choir-boy . Not at all bookish , but the Jesuits had given him a good , firm way with the studying . And he was an only . An only child . Bunt 's tries with those who were n't had never been quite as comfortable . And one with the daring  --  Bunt 's mouth had fallen open  --  to say what he just had . Though the Bronsteins never poached socially on the families of boys he brought home , and Bunt was grateful for it , he now wondered if he might n't introduce to them the Zitkowers , perhaps invite them to one of Maeve 's " do 's " as she was now calling them , or get his parents invited to the Z 's Sunday open-house . He saw himself and Witty on the sidelines , picking it all up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sparrow 's and not only from the eczema  --  and his own eagle-sight . Then , at the appropriate time , they could discuss and define this current that was in their families , this energeticsadness that was so much the same . At this time , he had about accepted , out of the mouths of his parents , that New York was to blame . These days , a Saturday mood overtook Maeve that both the Quentins  --  Buddy and Bunt  --  recognized . This would come on after the football scores , or mid-way through the opera , before evening , and always when his parents had no evening date . The weekend shopping had been done , that morning at the latest . But there would still be time to buy something . Or to see the streets . Or to meet somebody they might know . Or to acquire somebody they knew slightly , to know better . " Look , I feel New Yorky , " his mother would cry.  | " Let 's go to Sherry 's before it closes . Or to Charles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the way out she would swing her basket almost vertically . " Watch it , Maeve , you 'll crown me , " his father would say , but he always went amicably , more recently shooting a look at Bunt which thrilled him . Now and then his father said " I 'll go for you , or Bunt will . What 's your need ? " Running to check her make-up she batted a hand at him . Say one thing , he remembered those walks , most of them cold ones . Their summers went another way , he to camps , they to trips , in a set-up which did have a kind of boring permanence . On the walks their family connection became clearer , almost stately . Just at that hour they could saunter , wistful but comfy . Triviality swayed in the air , all the nice kinds  --  smoke rounding from lips , wind in skirts , and block after block a peculiar under-rhythm like a smile stretching and waning , as people toddled to the plateglass , worshipful , and receded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shop . Yet if he ever had his own sadness it might begin on these walks . Home lingered at the other end of the snail-trail they had left behind them , getting to be a bright , jazzy place with known corners to be knuckled into and settled on , knee-lift chairs for Buddy 's business-wracked bones , and the hot dinner left early by the help , for Maeve to queen over in her housecoat of the week . Away from it now , home was boring to remember , with an edge of pain in that  --  but the kind of place he must be gratefulp25for . To be so , he had only to remind himself of certain school sermons and movies . Usually he bent his head into his chest , closed his eyes wherever he was and said sternly within his mind-cage : Concentration Camp . And it was true that the street , buzzing familiarly at all hours under the same mysterious sky , made him want to flail his arms and streak off  --  to be lonely and somewhere homebent at the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Look at it . And that . Maeve , did you see it ? Her . " A couple had just passed , done up for the evening . " Did you see him ? " They flirted , to show him they were wedded for life . " There 's that model I was telling you about . " They stopped in front of a Jag he would swop any day for a Honda . " Lefthand drive though . But that 's the color . " " Bronze . . . I 've been thinking of a pair of bronze shoes but I would n't know where to . Kid . Custom-made I 'd have to , probably . " He swung between their errands , long since able to tell which could or would harden into fact , and which would remain to travel ahead of them . " What a night it is , " his father said tenderly . When Buddy blessed the weather , he felt happy ; the weather could be anything . Most people were the other way round , but his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , before it saw him . " But it 's been a week . I 'll be glad to stay home . "  |p26His  mother was looking in a shop window full of towels Buddy thought he 'd seen somewhere . " Yes , I bought some . Italian  --  are n't they great ? But that bathroom gets seamier and seamier . Still , where we are , we have two finally . " " Oh not finally . Not for you , Maeve . And I 'm with you . But not this year . The office is moving up . And I may have something there that 'll surprise you . Then . . . we might even look for a co-op . " He caught Bunt 's arm and swung along with him . A pang went through him , that he might ever want to dwarf the world like them . He still did n't like his new room ; the corners were not the same . Witty 's room had stayed the same wherever ; he said their whole place , full of ikons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter how they enlarged it . Maybe it was because they were Catholic . Maeve was , but it was n't the same . She and his father had offered him the choice : Be like she 'd been , or a Jew like Buddy had . He had no reason to ; it was all in the past for them . " But maybe you 'd like it , " he 'd said , thinking of the sadness . " Church . " They had crowed at him . He always earned credit for smartness the wrong way . Now he put his head down and said some words to his ungrateful self . " What 's that you 're saying ? " his father said as they swung into Charles &; Co . " K-k-k- what ? "  | " Nothing . " It was his old stutter . K-k-k . " C-c-c co-op . Maeve 's basket filled slowly with stuff they would never use except maybe the biscuits ; she always bought one of anything she did n't know . " Calamari , " Buddy said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " When I was a kid on the farm , my mother bought artichokes because we could n't grow them , and made us eat them . So when we grew up , we 'd know how . " " Why she wo n't come down  --  " Buddy said . " She could have them every night . " And Maeve said as usual " It 's not the artichokes . " They had gone through all this before . Groceries seemed to bring it out in her . When Maeve 's father died , they had finally visited the farm in Amenia , New York . A stark white house , and the great swelling road , blond-green with spring then , rising to where the Berkshirescracked wide . " God , what a generous countryside that was . " Buddy meant that the people were meancolored , which he and Bunty had confided to each other  --  gray and blue tints to their skins , as if they 'd never been farmers at all . Diet , his father said , but it was plain that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MacNeil , the grandfather never yet seen , was a peanuty corpse with a floss of white on top , and a mick mouth which Maeve 's and his own were said to resemble . They werep28not like any Irish Buddy had even seen  --  no drinks , for one thing . Bunty , on whom great hope had been placed  --  " Be sure to say Granma MacNeil "  --  had not been a success  --  even his red hair and Maeve 's was a throwback , Mrs. MacNeil said , none of theirs . This did fascinate him . " Do n't you own your own throwbacks ? " She had a triangular jaw like a cat 's , a heart probably of cat-size also , and a set of thin coin-silver spoons , much valued , and often described by his mother . He had tried to steal a spoon for her . " What are you doing , Jew-brat ? " After the visit , the three of them had driven straight north , through the blue gap in the mountains , to a Treadway Inn where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents drunk for the only time . They were drunk at each other . " Do n't you dare send her money , Buddy , " Maeve had said . " To have it thrown back to you . That I 'm living like she wanted me to , with you . Do n't you ever dare . " Sometimes he had a fantasy of summer there , the blackberry brambles fruited now , and the warm , consolingflanks of cows . " You could send her the calamari , " he said now . " Your whole gormay shelf . " Which Maeve catalogued carefully , studying the labels , then left . Maeve choked . Buddy 's face , never too small for affection , smiled lopsided . Like the cow , against whose side Bunty had put his own shamed head , he had consoled.  |p29Though  Buddy 's parents were dead , and a successfulbrother and sister lived in California  --  visits mutually planned but never yet made  --  he still scattered money constantly through remnant Brooklyn counsins , and was always invited to all weddings and bar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those , and touting the warm family life they would find there . Now and then a cousin dropped by apologetically ; Manhattan did not appeal to them . " With a store like A &S,'; " Buddy quoted , " who needs a Korvette 's ? Waddya need all the push ? ' They must be the last hold-outs in Flatbush . And now maybe they have the Korvette 's . " In Charles 's that afternoon , a woman standing near smiled at Maeve . " Scrimshaw . Your bag . " She had short white hair , blue-chip eyes , and a tweedy air of well-being . " Nantucket ? " Maeve nodded down at the small straw bag with the bone plaque on its lid , scratched with a picture of a whale . Easter before last , when they had been up there for a couple of weeks , Maeve had spied certain women carrying them like badges  --  permanent residents , she said , not tourists like them .

" " No , we have n't been for some years , " Maeve said . " We go to Italy now . " They had gone to an Italian spa for Buddy 's relaxation  --  " Wuddyaknow , I have a liver now , " his father said joking  --  for three weeks last spring . " I wanted to order one for mother .

I 'm afraid I ca n't think of the name just now . But I have it at home . " Buddy gave a snuffle , covered by the handkerchief he took without hurry from his breastpocket . He got away with a lot of such hamming , Bunty now observed , because of his gestures being in a small radius . " Oh , would you ? May I call ? Or my secretary . I 'm just catching a plane . " " I 'll phone you , Mrs. Reeves . " Maeve had on the mick charm-smile Bunty formally denied himself if he thought of it . " I know who you are . " " Oh ... thank you very much .

" She 's running for Assembly , " his father said . " But why Wednesday ? " " They have a house in Delaware . They fly down every weekend , I hear . In a private plane . She often stops in here before . " " Why , Maeve . " " Then they must use the stuff she buys , " he said . " Shut up , Bunt , " his father said .

" These days , at any mention of the office , where his mother never went now even with him , his father turnedp32vague . " Changes are being made . Maybe later on , Maeve . Not just now . " He turned full at her though , so she could see his smile . " Anyhow , you sure learn quick . " " People have to go somewhere on Sunday . Even wanted people . I came from a small town . I know . " " Maeve ... " Buddy said . " Want to go to a show tonight ? I 've got an in with that ticket broker at the Waldorf . We could . " When his mother 's face broke open like that he could see why Witty had called her a sparkle-plenty dame , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , slightly toward himself. " aunty , you 're old enough to stay alone , " his father said . " Are n't you ? " " Sure . " He straightened up and made his heels ring . We ca n't embarrass him much longer with a sitter , Buddy had said to her in the bathroom sometime back . The two bathrooms , his and theirs , were end to end , and the old building not as soundproof as Maeve made out ; what he heard there would have been useful found goods , except that the Bunty discussed there seemed not himself but a kind of mule-stupid dollbaby he scarcely recognized . " Maybe I 'll call Witkower . " He would never . He would hanker to , but never trust himself near the phone , to cross the weekend barrier . Four times a night , some schooldays , but tonight , what Witty would think ? Foreigners  --  theyprobably had a huge family intimacy going . Home came quickly . The street was never that mys/terious , going back . He stood in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , chest and chair , though not the same ones , and tried to remember the last foyer . He already knew what it was like to be alone here  --  they 'd forgotten they had already left him , once . Now and then it was a little scary , if you had one of those moments when you looked at your hands , saw your feet , shifted awareness with a jolt , realizing for an eerie minute that you were  --  yourself . And the place was not consoling . Maeve was marking the calendar by the phone . " Wednesday , " she muttered . Buddy smiled at him . " Your mother 's the smartest little secretary a man ever had . " He seemed dimmer , Quentin again . " I 'm not sure I do n't think Witty is too old for you , " Maeve said , turning suddenly . He had a feeling shex might grab him , the bathroom Bunty , and whip him off to a department store . She was always Maeve . Buddy was Quentin also ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bunt was old enough . Funny though , how they never saw the real things were where you had to have your alternatives . It was possible to think them shabby . But he would never be ashamed of them . " That Mrs. Reeves , " he said . " Her mother must be a million years old . " He could always break them up . That cheered him . Already he had begun to feel himself the guardian of the real things  --  though he did n't yet know what these were.  |p34Mrs  . Reeves was unable after all to come to them on the Wednesday arranged for her  --  on what he heard the gathered women tell one another was a perfectly good excuse . But one Sunday weeks later , met by the Bronsteins , who were laden with last-minute cocktail items , she had surprisingly come back with them . It was a dark day , perhaps no planes were flying , her unsuccessfulcampaign was over , and as Bunty was helping fix the hors d'oeuvre , he heard his parents say there were rumors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had appeared alternately gay and distracted in a halting way , and wanting to be near any transient warmth , even theirs  --  as if she might be having one of those moments when she knew she was herself . In the intervening weeks he himself had grown used to these ; his parents went out many weekend nights now , and he never called Wit . As their lone guest at first , Mrs. Reeves had been calmed by their devoted cocktail attentions , later greetingcivilly each of the " the week 's pickups , " as Buddy called them  --  the man from the Arthur Murray dance studio  --  in whose group Maeve had once been , the Bronsteins ' dentist 's assistant and her new fiance , also one of Bunt 's teachers and the reedy vocal coach who lived with his spaniel-faced friend on the ground-floor.  | " Oh yes , " Bunt heard Buddy say later that night , on the other side of the bathroom wall . " She treated us all with the consideration of a candidate . " " Buddy  --  " Maeve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house that got all her impertinence , Maeve  --  did n't you see ? " Reeves 'd been angry for sure to find herself here , and went for the house instead of them . " Boy  --  " she 'd said to him as he passed her the first plate of his own hors d'oeuvre  --  ( out of boredom , and some interest in the company , any company on the long Sunday , he 'd become adept at getting tins open and their contents into praisedly weird combos )  --  " boy , what is that awful thing over there  --  a girandole ? " He knew she should n't speak that way to him , and stared at her until she dropped her eyes and asked him , in her Nantucket voice , where he was at school . " Ah yes , that 's the one people move in for . " But she seemed to calm herself again , now that he had made her realize he was a child , and asked him if he played that nice old upright piano . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only thing here that 's really ours . " Which since all this lot had been acquired at Bloomingdale 's , was what he felt . He 'd made her one more polite offer of his tray , pretending meanwhilethat he was at diplomatic reception  --  at school his class was doing careers and he had chosen as his project Ambassador  --  and had moved on . He 'd just been consideringwhether the tray was n't a flaw in his role , whenp36the coach and his friend came up . " How'dyou get the name Bunty ? " they said in chorus . Rehearsed it maybe , the way Buddy could sometimes be heard in low-voiced shaving monologue , speaking to the trade . Did his mother 's guests all look so uneasy because they were here , or because they were themselves ? " It 's a Little League connosh . . . connotiation , " Bunt said , in character , then ambled into the kitchen , where he dumped tray and responsibility , walked on down the hall as a third secretary of the legation , and landed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high mystic glee which had to be shared . His wealth of gathering experience dazzled him , but at the same time he had to confirm the world with his own kind , even if all he said when Witty came to the phone was " How 's tricks ? " Lately , though they were still close , Witkower had taken to girls , advising " Get onto it , Bronstein , " and Bunty , since his thirteenth birthday , had taken one to the Modern several times . Tonight , Wit had said " Jesus , what a weekend ! " the minute he picked up , giving Bunt scarcely time to recall the barrier which had been crossed . " Jesus , am I glad you called . " They were deep in Wit 's story when his parents , showing Mrs. Reeves the house , had knocked at his open door . " Hold it Wit  --  " he 'd said . " Here 's folks . " With what had happened to Witkower , this bathroom corner to which he 'd retreated once the party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for sometime . It had a chair whose marine-blue fur  --  matched to the Anchors Aweigh bedroom pattern his father called " Macy's-by-the-sea "  --  had worn off comfortably under his bottom , and the paint above the tiles was solid with the pinups of a lifetime ; he even studied here . Until now he 'd also valued it for the voices on the other side of the wall . Though he felt guilty when they talked about him , the natural opacity of parents was such that without this extra he would never have understood them . Tonight , hearing them really fight for the first time , even then raising issues more than voices , he caught onto why they spent so much time together in there . Though they must have heard him wash and flush his toilet when he remembered to , since he had no one to talk with it was the one place in the house where they felt soundproof from him . " Yes , the house got it . But it wo n't always , Buddy . You 'll see . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nothing in the stores , for tonight . " You 'll see . By next year . " " Not next year , Maeve . " " You moved the office , " his mother said . He began to study a break in the tiles near his right foot . With his left eye closed , it looked like a lion 's head . With his right , the rhomboid pattern itself pushed forward . With both eyes open , it was only a floor . Pretty soon he could expect to forget Wit 's face . The features , that is . Now and then  --  as had happened for a while with Ike , who was now only a name and a feeling  --  he could also expect the whole face to flash back . " Moved the  --  is that all it means to you ? I changedp38my whole  --  life . Papa , he would 've done handsprings all the way from Maiden Lane to the docks . And you do n't even come downtown to see . " " Because I 'm your wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Where you live  --  " Quentin said . " Who knows ? When you can let that woman say that to you . And let it pass . " Entering his room talking , Mrs. Reeves had posed there , once again herself as when she had first met them . He 'd hung up the phone , whispering Wit a quick goodbye . Maybe they 'd see each other again , probably not . " Good grief , " Mrs. Reeves had said , surveying his blue cork bunk with the hawsered bedspread  --  real rope  --  and himself , miserably back of the foc'sle wheel where the phone was . " Good grief , what do people imagine children think ! " He had n't ever considered . What people could think , had thought about Witkower , was what interested him . What they thought about everything . " Your wife says you 're looking for a co-op , Mr. Bronstein . If you 're new here , you 'll find some of the older ones further over our way have a nice country feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a drink or two . Fingering her pearls , she held them draped at her shoulder . " I must say , these furnished flats are the very worst . "  |p39He  'd looked up then , at Maeve . Buddy was watching her . Neither had laughed , as expected . No sweat . " Nobody pays us to laugh , " Witty had hummed at their last movie together  --  the same song he was always on . Witkower had been caught on a sofa with a girl , and was being transferred to a Catholic school . A preppy one , out-of-town . What his folks took most serious , Witty had said , was that when they 'd gone on about making the girl pregnant , he 'd told them he 'd used something . " Well , nobody pays us to laugh , " Wit said on the phone . " No-ho-body pays us to cry-y . ' " What Bunt wanted to ask , he could n't  --  had Wit been wearing his ivory cross at the time , or had n't he ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Wit had joined the lost ones who never wailed but were an increasing , silent panel in the back of his mind . They never wailed because they did n't know they were lost . " Why did you lie to her Maeve ? In front of your own son . " " I did n't lie . " " You did n't deny . " " In front of you , you mean . You 're just sore because she thought you were new . When your father came here in nineteen-oh five . " Buddy gave a laugh . " Everybody 's always new in New York . But maybe you have to be born here to know . " After a pause , Buddy said " You wo n't come downtown ? You could have a lot of range these days . Partnerseven . In a way . " " Ah Buddy . Hon , listen . I know you mean well.  |p40And  I know you do n't mean it for real  --  do n't I know how you operate ? No . Listen . There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty blocks . Not the younger ones . The young married ones . Cool . . . you can spot them anywhere . Not always the society ones . Not dumb . Busy , too . But their position in life is very clear . Their men make the waves downtown . They float along with them . . . I want to be one of those . Ten years on . " " You wanted to be , Maeve . At our age , nobody floats . " He 'd grown sleepy and had pulled out his math homework . He was good at it ; Buddy had helped him to be . Math was like the dream behind the money , his father said . He 'd about finished one set of problems when Maeve said , " Maybe . . . the country , Buddy ? Not too far up for you . But where it 's friendlier because everybody is new . And I 'll get somebody to help me fix up the house . Because I tend to overdo . You know that . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have cried . " You 'll be proud of it . You can bring people up for weekends . You 're better at that too . Not from the office maybe . But from New York . " He waited for Bud 's answer . " I do n't know , Maeve . Horses ? Golf ? You have to have an interest anywhere you are . Make connections . Or it can be deadly there too . " " Not Westchester . Maybe the Sound . A Nantuckety little house . " She giggled.  | " And you have just the handbag for it . No , not this year . After that , I 'm with you . But not yet . " " You might even commute to lower Manhattan by boat . I 've heard of that . " " Couple of my  --  new associates  --  do it , " Quentin said . " It is healthy . " Bunty sat up . His father loved water , the bigness he said it gave to a house , or a man . Or to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Back in Amenia he had talked of it . " Funny , " he 'd said to Bunty , " how mountains can make for mean minds . No wonder your mother wanted out . " " And for Bunty . Buddy . The teens are bad here . " He let his books slide , half hoping they 'd hear . Did n't they know what the teeners up there in placeslike that were like now ? Bored to murder , without thestreets , Witty 'd said ; he knew all kinds of stories fromthe Catholic network . How one group of kids had regularlyvandalized the houses of certain sodality womenthey 'd had a hate on . How the Fathers had turned upa Manson-type black-Mass group just in time , in GardenCity  --  and how the young faith in Fort Lee might aswell be in flames . For every pair of parents that movedtheir ten-year-olds out , Witty 'd said , there 'd soon betwice as many moving their fifteen-year-olds back . Outsidetheir own school , PS 6 , Wit 'd pointed out someof these older ones calling for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debased clothing  --  dirty jeans below , on top angoras and custom leath/er  --  who all drove clamped to their little cars , as if driving snowmobiles . Why Wit should think a bad scene was more sacriligious when it took place in woods and leaves , he could n't say  --  except for the cows , maybe . There was a girl in their own grade who pushed dope , and a boy who stole for it . What Wit had done , his parents should give thanks , it was so clean . " We could send him off to school , " Quentin said . " I 've been thinking of it . Not that it is n't the same for them everywhere these days . " " In the right town , we would n't have to send him away . With the right school . Oh Buddy , forget the co-op . Let me start to look . Why should just Bunty go away ; maybe the city 's killing all of us . Oh Buddy ... Quentin . . . let me look . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healing , had been torn again . If some doctor had asked " Do you love it here ? " he 'd be cagey . But the streets were mysterious . The flanks of buildings  --  his eye sometimes leaned on them . Cronies had been . And were possible . No , no , we wo n't go . He began beating on the wall to the rhythm of it . Let them kick their sadness by themselves . Home 's their concentration camp . Where they send you away , for their sins . He began bawling . " No , No . Nobody pays me to laugh . Nobody pays me to cry . " He could n't remember the last line until much later . Why should we be staying folks ?  --  for your bye-and-bye . They rushed in  --  through the wall , it seemed to him.  |p43He  was inviolate in his own childhood  --  where they could be heard . They would never hear him . " Not away from the city , Maeve , " Buddy said , holdinghim in his arms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year or so later , when they were to move to the Park Avenue place , he was in the lobby at eight AM , sent to wait for the vans ; the substitute day man had fouled up the intercom . Shannon , for some reason , was n't due until noon . After several vans had come from the various thrift shops and Salvation Army  --  to whom Maeve was giving everything but their personals , he sat on , waiting to say goodbye to Shannon . During the year , this place had become a co-op too . With bright new oriental rugs , a new super who oiled the walnut paneling , and two-thirds new tenants who breezed into their ownership like pioneers . His father agreed the place had picked up wonderfully , but confidedto him that it would n't be nearly as good a buy as the one they were going to  --  not when you came to sell . Before nine o'clock , at least four boys his own age came down with their dogs . Two gave him an interested look when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introductions would have been made . In any case , all the kids here would be going to his old school probably ,  |p44and  under a different calendar from his . Through " influence " which Buddy had suddently pulled out of a hat , against his own principle of never mixing " downtown " and home , Bunty had been admitted to the Lycee , where he would go until he went away to a school in Massachusetts that was holding a place for him . This had been the bargain offered him for their not moving out . He had n't understood what had scared them so , but since any choices he would 've made had retreated into the past , he acceded silently  --  which worriedthem more . The Lycee was cliquey , though the girls were friendlier . He 'd already taken a girl named Paulina Vespasi  --  whosefather was an Ambassador , and her sidekick Dolly Something , to the Museum of the City of New York . This had come about because of the only Italian he knew , which he had blurted out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind . The endlessly linguistic air of the school miffed him anyway . " Altro che ! " he had muttered to himself . " Altro che ! " and she had turned round delightedly . " Come ? " At Montecatini , where the doctor had sent his father again , he had met three boys : Perrin , from Manchester , England , Emilio from Siena , and Frank Massler , from Princeton , New Jersey , USA . As an old hand , he was modestly able to show them all the paths and haunts that were useful to the healthier young . " Oh , any place you been twice , " he said . But it made an emotion . Hotel life , with its known hours and meeting-places , hadp45quickly made them intimates ; then the spa had been enveloped for days in scarves of mist and fizzy rain that sent the four of them into huddles , games , doodling on the hotel piano until they were stopped , conspiracies , a few fool tricks on the concierge that he still chortled over  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Englishspeaking , had shared his Vespa with them , as well as deadpan tales of his family life , which appeared to take place around an enormous soup plate , or else in the bed where his parents made babies so noisily they always woke the latest one . " But I forgive them everything , for making me a Sienese . " Perrin , a thin , glassy-looking boy , was rude to Bunty and Frank in a dirty way that glinted through his stiff manners , but they left him alone , since he and his mother , who was really ill , were here on a shoestring , and he was so knowingabout all the monuments they cooked up trips to . Bunty and Frank  --  a shy boy , good at math also  --  were required to be authorities on America . Perrin taught all three how to make brass rubbings ; it was Emilio who noticed that Bronstein 's were the best . At home , buildingsnew or old were spoken of either as acquisitions or as enemies in a kind of soft war . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes glossing past people to return to their stony flanks . Nothing since the cows had so affected him . On the last dusk over there , after scavenging all day for the puny wood and stealing some , they had made a bonfire near a lake . " A tarn , " Perrin said inp46his competent voice , " anything smelly as this is a tarn . " He had brought chocolate . Emilio was chef . " The Americanscatch the rabbits , but do n't know how to skin them . " Everything Emilio said sounded like a proverb . High up , above the brittly leaves that shone without lightsourcefrom the gloomy cloud-castles piling in on their spot of fire , a ruined donjon clung to a crag . His chest stretched with yearning  --  how could he yearn so to be where he was ? Everything was so solid . Perrin , cleaning up the last of the stew in his famished way , said " Why do n't you two  --  would you teach us , Emilio and me  --  one of your American Indian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't being dirty . For days , ( while his mother coughed up what Frank , whose father was a doctor , said must be " the last positive TB sputum in civilized Europe , and that 's a national health service for you ! " ) . Perrin , who had seen all the American movies , had been deep in the Leatherstocking Tales . Emilio had clapped a hand over his own telltale mouth . Wrinkling his forehead like a saint 's , he had signaled the two others what they must do . Solemnly , Frank and Bunty had begun doing it , hop-hop into the war-dance , bending low into their knees , Ugh ! Ugh ! They pranced high with the tomahawk , making the ullaullawhoop , palms batted against lips  --  " Wah-h-h . " Emilio had joined in , then at last , Perrin . Fallen flat on their backs in a circle , toes in , they lay for awhile looking up , without laughing . On the trail down , he saw that the back of the donjon held a line of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a berry , " Buddy said leaning out a window , his face chastened and thinner . " What a shame , just when we 're leaving , " Maeve said , slamming it rhythmically into her packing-hand . But Bunty , on his two feet , slouched inside the narrow doorframe with his feet on one side and his shoulders braced against the other , kept on reading a Wall Street Journal he had filched from their **25;14515;TOOLONG ; he had ways of dealing with these things now , and had already left . In the lobby by now , only older people were taking their dogs out . When the new day-man finally called out , " Waitin ' for anythin ' , kid ? " , and told , answered , " Shannon wo n't be in today , called in sick " , he rose to his feet and height  --  almost five eleven now  --  and dealt . Rise to the feet , avoid all corners at these times , lean forward  --  project ! Already , at the Lycee , he was projectingforward to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before going to a larger school he had better try for if he was going to Yale to be an architect . His allegiance was all to schools now ; he liked to think of that line-up awaiting him . " Tell Shannon goodbye , . . . and a penny from Eagle Eye . " He was about to hand over the coin he had been palming since he got down here , then thought better of it . A ten-dollar goldpiece he had got from his grandfather , on Abe 's eightieth birthday and his eighth  --  perhaps he 'd better send it , or stop by . He knew he would never stop by . Outside , he paused , wondering whether Maeve hadp48unwontedly said " Take a cab , we 'll meet you there , " because Park Avenue required his arriving in that style , then decided it was only her drama-of-the-day and started walking the seventeen blocks down . Just then another van drew up . Could n't be for the Bronsteins . It was . " Half a van-load , including a piano , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the personals . " Grand or upright , " the driver said . " Upright . " " Better be . We do n't move grands . " When they had loaded up , he cadged a ride with them . Were n't supposed to , the boss man said , then relented . Could n't believe Bunty was only the false sixteenhe 'd said he was , anyway . " Looks like seventeen , do n't he , boys ? Here kid , stick this cap on your head , they 'll think you 're only another Irishman . Ca n't sit up front though ; I could be fired for it . " Back of the van was where he wanted . And since the van was even less than half full , and the last thing in  --  the piano  --  was securely strapped and shrouded , they let him keep open the door . Laughing at him . At first he let his legs dangle , but that might n't be too good for their insurance either , so he stood up . Turning a corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ housings , jogging handsomely over east , then south , over rubble and through the deference of cabdriversand even busses , he saw the streets as he never had before . Inside the van , there were curved struts , not a straight , dull vanside ; the opening where he bal/anted was shirred like a great horseshoe , canvassed like an old canteen . Between him and the pile of khaki wrapclothsthere was really a line of calico curtain . Behind the calico , somebody lay sick ; there was always somebody sick , in a covered wagon . His eyes were sharp but he did n't know for what . Not for Indians . When they rolled up to the awning , the new building , which he had n't seen yet , turned out to be more or less like the one he 'd left , only bigger . There were some ornaments though , to distinguish it by . And a new doorman . He jumped off the truck and watched the crew of two unload , knowing better than to offer help . When they came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door closed , he went around front to the cab with its contents , and held up the cap . " Thanks very much for the ride . It was super . And please , could I give you this ? " They were shocked to the gills , he could see that , and refused at first , meaning it . But he stood his ground . " Please . The guy it was for back there , did n't show up . And I 'll remember the ride . " " Damtootin ' you will . " They took the gold coin , vowingto split it between them , or toss for who would keep it for his kids . Once they 'd decided to take it , he saw he was out of it . When they drove off , he did n't need to wonder what they said of him . But the ride really had been of use to him . Like a perspective pointed back , it had shown him that even if he were to send the goldpieceas planned , carefully wrapped , stamped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the boys and girls in the house , as well as a man of few phrases  --  might n't know who had sent it . Even if Bunt put a return name on it , Shannon might n't know from which of his brood of eaglets the " penny " had come . Yes , the new building was made of the same sturdy , dank stone , a solidified gloom that entered the chest , surrounded him from behind , and took him two or three flights up in the elevator to forget . But the apartment , eight rooms , spiked around an anteroom with a weak , white mantel which hung there like a mouth waiting to be shut or stuffed , did have the look of a family place , even in spite of the one feature that gave Maeve such glee . A black-and-white terazzo floor , put in by the last tenant , began at the halldoor like a mad dream of Italy , and stopped well in the field of vision one and a half rooms down . " What 's so funny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for moving-days . He leaned there hysterically pointing to where the dream floor stopped . " He woke up . " By nightfall the furniture was in and placed ; Maeve and a decorator had planned it like a battle this time ; they were into Swedish maids now , and a Helga was there to help . His books were in his room . When he complained , with a venom new to him , that one of them  --  " the one book I needed "  --  was lost , it was found for him . Whatever his mother was learning , she wasp51very apologetic toward him . In return , he allowed nothing in his room except the servants ' bed and dresser that the maid Marlene had once had , a load of bricks he made bookshelves from , and the last tenant 's wallpaper , loud as bagpipes , which , as the rest of the place came to a discreet , fawn-gray completion , went off with a bang every time he opened his door . " But your room 's so central ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her change it . Usefully maybe , it taught him the architectural liabilities of a circular house . And brought him and Buddy into what one of the Brooklyn cousins  --  this time the move had smoked out a few well-wishers snoopy enough to pay Manhattan parking-rates  --  had called " a lovely relationship between a father and his boy . " Buddy often came into his room now to watch TV , dragging his posture-chair . " What do you think of the joint ? " he said one night , swinging the chair to look out at it . Bunty shrugged . " It looks like  --  you know  --  . " He shrugged again . Not a joint . " You could copulate in this place at a teaparty , " Buddy said . " The mirrors would be too well-bred to notice it . With twelve Mrs. Reeves 's you could do it , God forbid . And her mother . " Then they went back to TV . Otherwise , they were all three on even keel again . This place was soundproof for real , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to build secrets and wrench his personality away from the Bunty-doll they had boughtp52for him . As Buddy 's propositions for him became more acute , he realized that this might always have been the case , but there were hazards there too . The more space his father delicately strained to leave around him for his own growth , the more he thought he could see how his father 's space must already be crisscrossed and hedged . Meanwhile , away at school , where they were being taught to log computers , he and a boy named Betts often went back after hours ; cronies sharing only this , like a couple of garage mechanics . The school 's two pieces of equipment  --  one gift horse , one boughten  --  which were set up in an angle off the science lab that had once been a butler 's pantry , and were always breaking down , began to seem to him like a pair of older brothers who had worn themselves out in the serviceof the young . For a while , no matter what permutationsand combinations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely simpler tensions in himself . Until a time came when it occurred to him that the more vocabulary he would have , the more complicated would become the offering . The spring day outside the lab window suddenly seemed to him more  --  whatever . And switching to soccer and swimming , he never went back . One vacation home , coming in from a very adequate day  --  morning at the Metropolitan Museum , lunch in the Modern 's garden , and a two o'clock track meet at the Garden , he found Maeve displaying his room withp53a certain pride , like the cage of some freak she fondly kept there . He passed her with a swat " Hi , Ma , " and went in . Calling her that kept the distance , though " Pa-ing " Buddy was still impossible . Outside his closed door he heard the cousin say , " What a nice normal boy ! "  --  Brooklyn 's tribute to his short hair , which when longer kept his fair scalp too itchy with pool chlorine . He smiled , his heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to his lair . He knew he was as normal as a boy dared to be these days . He got merely good grades in a class where half were rated as gifted , had just made it up from second swimming team to substitute on first , and was in steady pursuit of three girls , one of whom had already been caught . EOF  --  aS Betts used to say . END OF FILE This was the end of the linear life . The week before he was twenty-one , Quentin wired him to one of his maildrops , the last one . He 'd been on a Scottish walking-trip now over  --  two tents , three men , four girls . " You can come home now from finishing-school , " the wire said . He stopped off at the PO in Malleig , apologizing for his dripping boots and hands as if the weather were his , not theirs , and sent a returnp54cable : " Buy a yarmulka for August fifth . " The postmistress , a young woman , wrote it out for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she pushed the slip back at him , accurately done , and he reminded himself that the Scots were the best-educated plain people in the Isles , especially on religion  --  one more pennyworth of acquired knowledge he would now have to carry home with him . He grinned at her , tipping the soaking tam he had discarded a tarboosh for some weeks back . The twenty-pocketed jacket he wore signaled to any gamekeeper that he was one of earth 's exalted , but he had forgotten this . The girl behind the counter was about his age , a buxom bit with the rosy , open face that was always lucky for him , but there was a child by the grate , and as the girl went toward it he saw she had another bun in the oven . On impulse he handed her his father 's cable to read . " He means  --  we 've ended the war . " Her hand went to her breast , her mouth quivered for him . " Are you on the run , then ? You 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emigrated back again from the America it was going to , and clove with hers , which would be grooved with all the firm feelings it must harbor : one man , one gun , one cot , one sod . " N-not officially . " He saw his boots had stopped puddling . They shook hands anyway . As he left , her glance , straying from child to him , was the same for them both.  |p55He  knew what it was as well as she ; he was a man  --  deferred . Luckier than some . He knew how that went , too . Buddy 's cable made him sore , though  --  as if his father had the idea he had n't thought about it . By the time he 'd left home for his lineup of schools , all the " better " ones had become expert in the art of obtaining military exemption  --  in New England they were partisan . Sharing with the Pentagon , as a master had said , a taste for the best material . Halfway through the tenth grade , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were to veer just slightly off-center of his stated interest , to a more mathematically involved one , he might qualify for a national science fellowship  --  for reasons that had nothing to do with need . By the time he got a draft number , he was onto the fact that the odds in his crapgame with time were nevertheless better , since his draft board , whatever its stand on " educational " deferment , had at hand the great body-pool of New York . So he 'd become part of his part of his generation , of the equilibrating young Americans flying the world on their trapezes , along with their girls . In summers and other off-times , or even when a boy 's number , a man 's , had been pulled  --  but while there were still maybe two kinds of delaying action , or one , or maybe none  --  they ate up the world in tramp-travel . Not a dodgingyet , just out on the road . In his nine months abroad he 'd been on a bus to India , a dirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before he had ever stoppedp56to stare at a major city ; his kind knew rat-corners of the world that even the artists had n't got to yet . " Waddya mean  --  we are artists , " a big Californian had said to him in a hostel in Wales . " At not doing what we want . Or not finding it out . " All the big guy had wanted at the start was to go into the land business in Orange County with his father . " Raise kids and a big fat bankroll  --  and what woulda been wrong with that ? " His blond Tarzan jaw worked belligerently on the target that had escaped . He had boondoggled nearly eight years of school  --  engineering mostly  --  through a really ace set of grad school ploys , only to discover , now that the simple life he wanted was legal again , he could n't get himself to go back to it . He spat on the floor , then looked guilty , suffering from manners he had once had . The hostel was full of ruddy-cheeked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ younger . " I know too much . I 'm twenty-six years old . " He and his pals did n't usually middle-class it in places like this . " But hell  --  it is armistice . " Actually , he had n't been vulnerable to the draft for some time . When he could no longer explain his inertia , and the home money had stopped , he 'd joined up with the hippies for a while , selling leather on the Spanish Steps , doing chalk pavement-pics in front of the National Gallery . " I did blueprints of bombers , from aerodynamics class . One of the profs must of had a defense tie-in . " A London paper got onto it , and he was stopped . " Some American general must of walked on it . " Hell , he could n't carep57less about politics . " Know what my ambition was ? " he said , his big angel-lips shaping the word . In the flickering gloom of the hostel , he looked like a boy in a dormitory , whispering what the prefects should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father . " His friend in the upper bunk , who after identifying himself as a writing student out of Stanford , had then buried his head , now raised it . The three Americans looked at one another . Names were n't the route these days , as against addresses and food-tips along the way , or an exchange of tags . A fall admission to Yale , architectureand life , Bunty had said . For one year . " Pol-i-tics , " the other student said , looking down at the big boy . " Do n't you know what you are ? You 're a veteran , just like the rest of us . Whether you took a CO , or went to Sweden , or took our route . You 're a fatality . Who 's alive . " He fell back , staring at the low roof , on a splinter of which he had hung his woolen drawers . His aquiline nose brushed them , and his crooked black brows . " You fought your war  --  to keep your legs and arms , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're being  --  " He sat up again . " What 's that word they called it last time ? " They waited . He was twenty-three , he 'd told them , and he attributed his deferments not to his academic fellowship , but to the fact that the town he came from knew his father had died as a naval officer . " Demobbed . " He lay back . He was n't going home to finish his thesis  --  a novel . " To Paris , why not ? That'sp58where all the second-coming Hemingways went last time or stayed on after ; we 'll be the third . " He already had a pouched vein in one cheek , that jumped like a cud . He knew one of those boys from the Korean war  --  a guy who by now had been reduced to writing travel stuff for the Sunday sections  --  but such were the risks . " Gon na live with my girl . " The vein moved with his smile , too . " She makes wind-sculpture . It sells . " Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shed in Meudon . Lending it . He pulled the hanging underwear over his face until only his nostrils showed , puffing white air . The hostel was at the foot of Mt . Snowdon , and the fire had gone down . Sleepers lay mounded down the vaulted hut in everything they had  --  duffels , car rugs and plastic ponchos , a sombrero marked " Brighton . " Summer soldiers . Bunty put a log on . One of the little Frenchies called out approvingly . They had their own wine . " My book 's a bummer , " the upper bunk said . " You were doing what you wanted , though , " Tarzansaid . Sometime during the night , Tarzan skipped , withoutpaying up for his share of the cheese and beer . " You 're lucky , " the student said to Bunty the next morning . " Getting out now . It 's the grad school hanging around that gets you marble-ized . " He smiled . Rightside up and uncovered , he looked mellower . " My girl 's expression once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Not at the moment . " They shook hands and parted . " Look us up inp59Meudon , you ever get there . You ca n't miss it . A big yellow shed . " How long " ever " might mean he did n't bother to say . " Do that , " Bunty said . " See you around . " He was n't expected to give his American address . Even if he knew it . Maeve had written him the new one , not long back , but nowadays he always wrote to his father 's office anyway . One Chase Plaza . You ca n't miss . On the plane home , he made time with one of the stewardesses , who gave him her address in Jackson Heights . " Quite the Don Juan , are n't you ? " the man who was his seatmate said . He was working from a portfolio , had a wedding band , and wore a flowery tie . All of a piece . " Nah , " Bunty said . " It just works out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or less had , though he 'd never counted  --  a Don Juan deal that repelled him . Next to the guy next to him though , he was probably an ace , their style . " Really does , huh ? How ? " Bunty turned . No , not a put-down . Except from age fifty to twenty-two . He leaned back , sliding the tarbooshdown his forehead . " Stewardesses ? Just never shoot the breeze with both of them . Start off right away on only one . " And play it harder the nearer New York , or other home bases . When they were going back to whatever they were n't into yet . Or were  --  and were wondering about it . The guy was closing his portfolio . Oy . Conversation.  | " You would n't believe it , but a friend of mine once got a dose from one of them , from a stewardess . One of ours , too . " " I guess they get very international . " " You a student ? " " No , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave her the nod . " I  --  f-fought in the war . " " But that was the other girl , " the guy said . " Or was n't it . " He peered after her down the aisle . It was n't . " This is the one that 's pushing dope . " " You do n't mean it . Good God . So you were over there . " He sneaked an uneasy glance at the Egyptian tarboosh , which had been acquired en route from India , in the airport at Nice . Bunty smiled . " That 's a very emotional tie you 're wearing , sir . " In his best Massachusetts accent . " Countess Mara . Like it ? " The stranger spread a little . Then caught his eye . " You kids . You infernal kids . " He launched into an account of his own kids , which since they were several , and all on his tail in various ways , lasted until Kennedy . As they were filing out , the first stewardess smiled at Bunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to snag his overcoat from the hatch . " Not to worry , " Bunt said in his ear . " She soundslike a nice girl , lives in Queens . And is thinking of runningoff to be one of the Children of God . Well , goodbye . " " Good Lord , that 's a sect , is n't it . Think twice . "  | " Oh , I 'm looking to be serious . So far , it has n't worked out . " " Keep trying . Look  --  my name 's Carroll Monteith . Ever want a job in a paper company , come see me . Here 's my card . " He was really giving it because Bunty , small deal as he was , was carrying away a piece of the guy 's life . The Monteith life . " Thanks . Thanks very much . " The card said " President . " " Branch of course . Of the St. Regis Paper Company . " " Oh I went to camp up there . " Their three-word slogan had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spite of himself , the urge to swap a piece of life was too strong . " Raped a twelve-year-old girl in those woods once . Mentally . Well  --  Keep Maine Green . " In the airport , he hoisted the bag Buddy had insisted on sending him from the safari place where he had bought Bunty 's presents ever since the thirteenth birthdayone  --  a Camping Companion , otherwise a knife with variously notched blades and many pocket-tools on the side , whose total claimed uses were a minimum of thirtynine . " No bar mitzvah , " Buddy said . " But from now on , you 're a pioneer . " Beginning to count , from corkscrew to thimble , tiny slide rule to measuring cups , nailfile , pliers and compass , his son had wondered whether his success with Paulina showed . The knife hadp62been stolen from him somewhere back , maybe in the government bar in Amsterdam  --  El Paradiso  --  where he had spent a lot of time . But he could still tally its uses , even after he 'd lost it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tarzan had taken it . He tucked his head in his chest now and said an admonishing string of syllables to himself ; though K-k-k and the concentration camps had gone , the impulse or tic had kept on  --  some nonsense-score that his subconsciouskept . Now and then one of these phrases endured long enough for him to link its language with himself more definitely , as people did their dreams . He thought the habit might come from his Catholic heritage , confessiveto the end  --  though it might just as well be a kind of Jewish " touch wood . " Once a girl he 'd spend a lot of time with , Jasmin Straight  --  on marital leave from a psychiatrist elsewhere in New York , but going back  --  had been sharp enough to notice , and they had spent an afternoon making up fake examples of these blurtings out , for both her and him , and guessing at them in turn . " Bill made " turned out to be the day she had charged an expensive dress to her husband , and first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of Vietnam in a Chinese restaurant . But when Jasmin got out of bed , tucking her chin in her chest in mock of him , she 'd leaned over him with a last one she would n't explain . " Uh-uh , too worthy a guilt . " Though he took her back to bed , he never wormed it out of her . He was home now . Where the non-repetition of people in his life could still so worry him , the way theyp63jogged companionably alongside , or intensely , then vanishedonly to reappear  --  in the African shadows of a dream , a plain American face mask-hanging -- or in daytimememory a Tenniel cat in the trees . The worst was when you saw the face within a strange face , as he had seen Jasmin 's once . But he had a vow that if he were ever to meet again any of these discards that had been winnowed out of the catalogue , it would have to be by the chance that would then be destiny . He would never call Jasmin up . Even though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning  --  after that he would take it on trust  --  his fate would be to re-encounter them all . He saw Buddy at the gate , feeling his own pride in him . Little fellow you 'd never catch wearing elevator shoes . Or those two-hundred-dollar elephant-hide ones either . The car that drew up for them had a chauffeur in it , but was n't a limousine . Since Buddy had become an investment broker without leaving off being a lawyer , and had subsequently become a consultant without leavingoff being a broker  --  after which Bunt was unsure of the details except that Buddy would never leave anythingbehind  --  his father had taken on the style of businessmoney with real money , wherever this saved him time , but always kept the style subservient  --  like makingp64the chauffeur-hire give him a smaller car . And he had never been persuaded  --  how Maeve had tried !  --  to make his success physical to himself . Sitting by his father on the familiar way in from Kennedy , his excitement grew ; this time he knew why . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't matter ; he 'd lived in sight of its demands all his life . First came the blind warehouses , black with the dirt of years , full of mysterious industrial guilts heaped in wood and slag and zinc . Then came the flat-topped houses of people who worked there , and lived in streets out of a policeman 's gazette . Then the newer factories , in whose clean halls the plastics refined themselves out of the living air , leaving behind a smell of Faust . A knot of viaducts , then old kiosks placarded with damp , then a spray of rumbling bridge over a slime of water . There , over there , the bristle of leafage and stone that had always been the Manhattan side . Scarabs of slum ; then gradually that burden lessened . They were approaching the East Sixties ; a mile north were the blocks where he had once been an Ambassador . Though they were n't going that far , even here the family sense was already strong . Maeve scrubbing city out of her neck with a nailbrush every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning he went to borrow a stake from the bank . The city was against your finding it irresistible . And it was anti-memory too . Like some sporting , sparringuncle who slapped you on the mended collarbone saying " That where I hit you , boy ? "  | " There 's the Manhattan Eye and Ear . " " Yeah , you had your tonsils out there . Maeve took you without telling you first . " Buddy 'd always resented this for him . Calm and self-knowing , a nurse whose hidden white smell was still with him now , had sat down gripping him between her knees , and held out under his chin the paper cup of the terrible , thick stuff . Milk of magnesia , nothing . He knew it came from her . But he got it down , the white potion that made you mad or loved , lame or invulnerable . It was the dram you had to drink . " From Central Park West . All the places we moved , Buddy . Do you ever mind ? " Travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His father folded his arms , like a man who recalls he has soft parts to protect . He glanced at the chauffeur 's barrier , as if the man out there could hear . " Hardest part is the philanthropy . You have to give to the opera , so you go to the opera . " Even with this , when they drew up on Fifth Avenue he still had n't understood what his father was trying to say . Though the new building , new not just to them , had black marble bays bucking out of its white  --  as if the builder had dreamed of Byzantine while at the dentist , and the canopy was a gold-braided and draped palanquin you could scarcely emerge from with proprietyunless you were on a horse  --  to him it was still only an apartment house . He did note that inside their state uniforms , the doormen were worse types every year.  |p66In  the elevator , Buddy said " Maeve 's parties are still the same , Bunt . But I should warn you . She thinks this one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at their floor . " Wow . One apartment to a floor . The Bronstein floor ? " Buddy nodded . There was a careworn look that some businessmen put on whenever their expenditure pointed to their own successes ; he had never done that : his sadnesses would be his own . He brightened . " Jesus , I forgot . " He took out two yarmulkas . " Found these in my chifforobe . " Solemnly , they donned them , then broke up . " Congratulations , kid . Glad you 're home . " They shook hands . " How 's Maeve ? " His chin dropped to his chest . What a sod he was , to wait until now to ask . A shrug . The same complicitous one his grandfatherused to exchange with the other men before they went into Sunday dinner , after conversations which were over a child 's head . He could smell the yellow fricassee , and hear the uncles . The shrug that Jewish men made before they went in to join the women . " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of keys , then thought better of it and rang , his head held high . Family life was a magnetic tape on which you were pulled along , hearing through walls maybe , but never speaking the ultimate  --  the process should not be disturbed . Two locks were needed here , and a buzzer went off before a maid appeared  --  so ethnic she looked Eng/lish to him  --  took his father 's coat , scanned him for one , and left on the double , as if they were both strangers . Always before , he had been introduced . The postmistressin Wales , would she gawp now  --  or know how to spell this too ? The Bronsteins had been on the up again while he was away ; it had been that way each time he stood in front of a new door . One could have programmedthe whole thing years ago ; use his parents as the knowns  --  how well he knew them !  --  and a stipulated equation for the money rise , and get your answer . Here . Idly he wondered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer cared about his room , though he knew there would be one . Europe had cured him of room-keeping , as even school never had ; to the last there he had cherished his pinups , and a mock-up of Rockefeller Center he had made of construction paper and dried fishbone . But now the Bronsteins could do what they wanted with his corner of them . He had an architecture in his head now that would n't go away , plus all those penny-weights of knowledge that might come in handy someday ; his head was now his house . Oh , so we 're richer , we 're that kind of rich now , was all he thought , shedding his bag just inside the door on a floor that was n't wood or even marble but some kind of inlaid brick . Real old brick , on second glance , Italian again . How did it feel here , transported like him , but begun and fabricated somewhere else ? " What 's that ? " A long black construct , like orange crates gone crenellated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of junk  --  perhaps a bat or mouse that lived in it . " Why Bud  --  is n't that a Nevelson ? " " Bought it for the office opening . But when we placed the really big piece of hardware  --  the Zebel thing  --  Zebel would n't have it near . Said it detracted . " Buddy shrugged . " I love her stuff , to me it looks like Brooklyn . But I just buy the tax deductions ; against these art-boys who am I ? And against Zebel . So I persuadedyour mother the Nevelson would look better here than some Merovingian hatrack . " They exchanged grins . Bronstein took off his tarboosh and hung it on one black spire , with what he thought was flair . " Go ahead , why not ? " his father said . " You know her father ran a lumberyard in Rockland , Maine ? Now that 's what I call artistic development . " And already twice today , that Maine had come up . But you could n't depend on it  --  that in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all mirrors  --  Maeve had always loved these , but had never attained octagons before  --  he stopped short . " Mother came to the office ? " A yarmulka had never looked right on Buddy 's **28;14542;TOOLONG haircut , over his oysterwhite , too-silky ties . Now , with the hair longer , even though smartly grayed by some barber , and in spite of one of those wide ties , by some designer who had been on Turkish kif maybe , it blended in . " Once she did . Once . " " How come ? "  | " For the opening . You did n't see the papers ? I had Blum send clips . No  --  of course . " The yarmulka nodded , sideways , in the old style ; it did have an influence . " The Mayor came , the Arts Council people too . A lot of , you know  --  people . " Buddy looked down his own length , always a sign of modesty . " I do a little work for things like the Odyssey House  --  dope rehabilitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , landmarkseven  --  " He flashed a kinship smile . " I keep out of the arts , except to give . " He sighed . " That opera . ... And to buy . But any other city question , they know I 'll go for it . From your grampa I get it , maybe  --  remember his wayward boys ? " " Sure do . " They had come in their Sunday suits from the orphanage or the reform school , and his grandfather had taken them to the ballgame . Limp hands in Bunty 's  --  theyseemed not to know how to shake it  --  and flinty eyes on him and his house . Or scared ones . He knew that look , from the PS before PS 6 . They were afraid they were n't to be trusted . There was always such a progression of them ; that was the trouble . One had lasted long enough in his grandfather 's esteem for the boy to be given a job , but it had n't worked out . " How 'd it work out down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not good , why should I lie to you ? She looked beautiful , absolutely . Your mother 's still a  --  " His father smeared two fingers over an eye and stretched his mouth . " But it does n't seem to help . Sit down , boy . Sit down . "  |p70He  sat on a satin bergere , on the edge . Through his father 's account , he saw the whole scene : the reception line , the photographer 's fireworks . " She hostessed it all just fine , just as if she had n't walked in cold on the arrangements , but had done it all herself . Cool she was , like born to it . And I thought , now I 've got it for her , it 's all turned out right . She even posed with Mrs. Blum . " His father 's secretary , from way back when . Whom Maeve had displaced . Who had again taken Maeve 's place . What a continuity , now that one thought of it . " Then some confounded girl reporter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of a pen  --  asked her if she had n't been my secretary , once . And I could see it begin to fall apart . " His father leaned into one of the mirrors as if he was seeing it there . " Once again . " Buddy smoothed his shave , clenched a fist and rested his chin on it , wide-eyeing himself in the glass  --  there was a picture of him in that posture as a newsboy , in knickers and shouldersack . " I should n't have started that secretary joke with her , years ago . When a person hurts , and you keep rubbing it in  --  maybe it all started with that secretary joke . " " I do n't buy that . " " You do n't ? Bunty , wan na know something ? Neither do I. But the psychiatrist does . " " She going to one ? " " No . Mine . " " You ? What do you need a  --  "  | " Thanks , pal . Because she would n't . Better than nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of equilibrium . " He hung back , then . Why was his father hanging back ? " Will I find her  --  changed ? " " No , son . " His father said it mildly . " Just the same . " He got up suddenly . " Say Bunt , take a look through here . " His father was applying his left eye to what looked like a metal-rimmed hole in one of the mirrors . " What is it ? " " No secrets , no more secrets . " Buddy applied the other eye to the hole . " Came with the house . A spyglass . From room-to-room . The public ones . First I thought I 'd block them off ; now I ca n't do without . Who 's ever at the party I wan na bypass , I can . Right up to my room . Take a look . " He saw a room in reverse opera-glass scale , at first only the floor . The device had a swivel , and a lens adjuster , very clever . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's on the same line as mine . Next to the armory . " " Armory ? " " The guy was a military buff . Wan na wash up ? " " No thanks . " He could n't resist though . " What 's it like ? " " Living like this ? Are n't I used ? " " My room . " " Not so bad , you know . She gave a lotta thought . "  | " Hell . I wo n't be staying , Buddy . " " She knew that , Bunty . She knew that . I 'll tell you what it 's like . It 's like a room in an Italian hotel . " His father closed the little round door of the spyhole , wiped its mirror with a handkerchief . You could hardly see it was there . " Smart , always so smart , is n't she ? " Buddy said . " When I pushed about the doctor . What 'll he tell me  --  ' she says . That I 'm a quick learner ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , Bunty  --  you understand that language ? " He 'd forgotten his father 's delicacy with a son 's other half . " Why not ? She does . " " Dreck . That an Irish girl should learn only that from us . From New York . " " Why New York ? " It burst from him . " Why not from Amenia ? " At once  --  echoes . Blaming the suburbs . He smiled to himself . Had n't thought of Witkower in a long time . " You think ? You think ? " " Now I remember , Buddy  --  " he said , grinning "  --  whenever you have one of those things on your head , you start talking like Gramps . " " Right . City College drops from me like a lei . " His father took off the embroidered circle , smoothed it . " Or maybe because I went back to Amenia , enn wye . A while back , Bunt . She was so low . I thought  --  up there 's the only audience Maeve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get it down here . " " You tried . Lots of times . " " I never went down on my knees before . Catholicsp73love the knee position . " He folded the yarmulka and put it in his pocket . " Brace yourself , Bunty , your Granma 's here . " " Mother MacNeil ? " " Herself . Her winsome self and all her broomsticks . She finally sold the farm . She had it up for sale for a long time . " " Sold it , huh . " He 'd like to think of it there , regardless . Quentin smiled at him . " To me . Oh she does n't know that . Through an agent . Yeah . I worked hard . " " And mother  --  how did she  --  ? " " With her mother ? Oh Maeve hated the idea  --  gave her something to live for . That 's when we moved here  --  remember ? " " Sort of . " He recalled a letter , that must have been asking him if he wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called it that , or even made quite plain that it was an invite . Said letter , and its successor reminding him to write to the office until they got settled  --  because he had n't written at all , of course  --  had been left behind on the washbasin of a convenience hotel in Montmartre ; he remembered the basin very well , and the girl he 'd picked up at the American Express  --  a last resort  --  and had spent a day with her until he tipped she was on speed . Streaking around the room after him like a candidate for Dracula : " Sure , I 'm still Algiers-nutty ; when it 's gone I 'll lay off . Done it before . " He 'd had a time getting her down . Bundled in her ski-cap and cape , she looked as pink and princess-faced as whenp74they met . " Being in the skin always sets me off , though . Ta-ta , Bunny . " She went off to meet her folks , who were picking her up to see Paris with them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which had annoyed him . And now he could n't dig up hers . " But that was only three months ago , Bud . " He looked down at the bergere he was sitting on , the mirrors , outlined in gold gesso , that reflected it , and him . Since first in Europe , he had begun to look . " Even for Maeve  --  this is some place to get together . " " Oh no , we bought it lock , stock and barrel , we did practically nothing . Was n't time . Well  --  let 's move on . They went through a couple of rooms that resembledthe old first one of their succession of places on Park  --  or what that one had been modeled on . Cooled down too , but older , and more windows  --  arched . " A harpsichord ! " The family pictures on it , his father 's parents and collaterals , were in silver now ; he remembered which place that happened in  --  the first East Side one , off Madison . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some three blocks east of here , was pretty much of a blank . Buddy patted the instrument on its flower-painted case . " Came with . Two others , we sold off . " " Some shopping spree . " " That was the idea . " Buddy stopped square under a pink-and-green china chandelier that flew and stopped at the same time , like a hunk of Mozart . " Was n't that  --  always the idea ? "  |p75All  this confidence they had kept from him , now must he have it in one big wad ? To make a man of him ? " Will you move again ? " " Where ? " His father swept the keyboard from top to bottom . No sound came out of it . It was a mute . Or else had to be pumped . Buddy looked mollified . " No . No more moving . A family ought to be hemmed in . It all sounded like shit . A world-dwarfing  --  the kind families picked . " It works with Maeve , then . Having  --  G-Granma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , putting them down again , one by one . " We forget , kid . Audiences do n't wait . " Mother MacNeil had had a stroke two days after getting here . " Maybe a compliment , " Buddy said . " Anyway , know all these nasty or stupid-looking old women in winghats and wheelchairs get walked around this neighborhood by some sweetfaced colored woman  --  I do n't know why but they always both are  --  well we 're in that class now too . Only Mother made clear , even with her whole left side paralyzed , that she does n't like blacks . So we have a broken-down gentlewoman  --  thinkthat 's what you 'd call her  --  instead . Think that 's what you will call her . " Buddy gave him a meaningful smirk he did n't get . " If you were n't a grown man , we could have a governess even . And the family would be complete . . . Well , here 's the dining room . We have n't eaten here yet . "  |p76And  no wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him . " Wh  --  when will you start . " " Today . All for you , Bunty-boy . " " It looks like  --  like the monk 's refectory on Mount Athos . " " Where 's that ? " " A monastery . Greek . On an island . Where no women can come , not even hens . " " So ? " " This place where we ate . " But not so fake browngaunt , so fake bare as this . And not so big . It was the long table reminded him . He should have said the Cloisters . If he 'd seen that tapestry in time , hanging on the bouldered wall like a muffled report from Art History I , he would have said it . For he could tell that he and Buddy , with all else shared  --  even at Maeve 's cost  --  had all of a sudden reached a low . Their lowest since he got here . Maybe because it was at Maeve 's cost , his father had now reneged . Anyway , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buddy , no fool , so delicate  --  he could feel it  --  had been offering him his confidence ! He gobbled something to his chest  --  no time to find out what . Buddy 's nostril twitched  --  had he been onto Bunt 's habit long since ? No , his eyes had what Maeve called his Ellis Island look . Greenhorn . Even Gramps had had it sometimes . " Monasteries . You go for them ? "  | " Just a place I went . " Irritated . Wrong . Slowly his boot-toe circled a floorboard wide as a modest coffin . The groined ceiling was like a cloister , only insufferably hot . His raw-wool shirt still smelled of its lanolin . Maybe his father had meant him to wash . If I stink like a sheep , he could say , it 's just Wales and emotion . Truly . Truth came out of him . " I g-guess , huh  --  we must be pretty rich . " Gawp . He could have picked nothing worse . He watched his father grind a fist on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window , where he turned his back  --  a family trait when agitated . A Bronstein trait like the shibbolethhis son had just stepped on . For a Bronstein , money was only the game behind the dream . Gramps , a CPA turned actuary , and always as much interested in other peoples ' incomes and probabilities as in his own , had drawn a stiff line between what you could do for money and what you must do with it  --  particularly for " those of our race " who had got past the starvation line with any sort of bounce . Maeve 's side of Bunty was resignedlyaccepted and given over to the women  --  who both took care of the assimilation that had to be in the new country , and took the blame for it . Exposure of what you had was the sin  --  the more you had . Every Sunday that Bunty sat with the men before dinner Grandfather had reached out of the endless conversation at some point to put a hand on his head for emphasis . " Bunty ,  |p78be  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family had adhered to this high standard , either way . Buddy , the youngest son , whom the eager , hawk-nosed females had belatedly named Quentin  --  " in 1925 ! " for Teddy Roosevelt 's dead hero-son  --  had done his best . " You boys , you slop around Europe , running around all the circles we left it for  --  what do you know ? " Buddy turned round , choked on his fury , yellow with it , clutching the curtain behind him . Whenever he grew fat and waxy , he dieted himself thin , until the newsboy 's face sat on his fifty-year-old shoulders . And had his blood run through all sorts of purifications , and returned to him  --  maybe not for health alone . " Knapsackingaround , never coming home , God forbid we should die and who do we notify poste restante ? A street address two weeks old , in Bombay ? In Holland a nightclub  --  whogoes to nightclubs in Holland ? And once in a while  --  lucky lucky  --  the American Express . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ About what , Buddy ? " He knew the question well . Asked of himself at every address . " About life in this country . About what goes on here , has to be done here . " " Compromises ? " He could never raise his voice to match Buddy 's . Maybe only fathers could manage it . He thought of Tarzan . " About what "  --  Buddy 's voice sank to a wheeze . " About what can be done in this country . " His eyes bulged ; he was tallying it . Opera houses . Prisons . Landmarks . Wayward boys.  |p79A  swinging door opened . A capped maid peered in to see what the rumpus was . Buddy waved her back , with a drowning gesture . The door closed . " Maybe you forgot , Dad , hmm ? Did you ? Why I left . " Homerun . How quickly the honeybrown , moneybrowneyes went wet , covered themselves with a hand . He could hear murmurs in the kitchen . To one side of the tapestry there was one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seeing only black , but waiting for Buddy to compose his face . When he did turn , Buddy was toeing the safari bag . " Still got it , huh . " He crossed the floor and stood beside him , nodding . Carry it everywhere . It 's my life . Lips tucked in , they nodded at each other with the barely perceptible orbit of mourners . But it was also as if his father , hands clasped , was worshipping him . Yes , I 'm your riches , your only . You helped hide me , or would have . What can an idol not made of stone say to you ? " Papa . You want me to wash ? " His room on the second floor was so like the hotel , his foot stopped at the door , as if another step would sink him deep in a cloud . A matter of wood that wasp80old and marble that was cheap , how had she caught that plain , sweet meagerness , even here ? Of a room privy to anything , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she had remembered to include Marlene'sold bureau . There was no more bookspace , though , than at Montecatini  --  a small ledge . She knew he could n't stay . The room told him what she had observed . Was meant to . When a man keeps telling a woman she 's smart , he wondered , when does she catch on he means smart but , even if he does n't know it yet ? From the first ? A few minutes later , he and Buddy , standing on a balcony overlooking the main hall  --  you had to call it a hall  --  were still avoiding her . To do so together was a comfort , and therefore worse . He put his head down and muttered something . " What ? " Buddy said . " Oh , nothing . " He had caught his own words just in time , always unnerving . Comforts are aging  --  Jasmin would have laughed . " Who built this place , some dictator ? " Two steps more and they could look down unseen , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no . Man I bought it from was a former tenor at the Met . See those spotlights in the ceiling ? Work out fine for the art . " Buddy coughed . There was pride here . " Rothko 's , are they ? And Clifford Still . " Down below , each panel glowed like a looking-glass entrance to a provence just behind it . Or an exit.  | " You know about them , huh . What do you know ! " Buddy held out his hand . " Sorry kid . What I said . Go round the world again , you want to . " " Please . " Button up . " Right . But we wo n't move from here . You can depend on it . " What a place to stop . Even the pictures want out . " Some South American had the place before that . The original owner , I do n't know . " People should save those things . There ought to be a bank for it . " Gangsters maybe ? Al Capone , that period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in came from a church , maybe forty years back . It would be an interestingplace to take a girl . " Bunt , the whole place went up only five years ago . " " Wuddya know . " Already he was talking like Buddy . " Well , let 's not lurk . " " I do n't see your mother down there . Maybe she 's in the terrarium . " " Where 's that ? " " We could n't put it on the Avenue side . Around the corner , on the court . Even for that , we had to have a variance . " He cast Bunt a look . " I 've had to take an interest . More and more . " There were about fourteen people down there , wanderingparty-style , their heads vulnerable to any boy on a viaduct . He saw that it was old party-style , twos and threes . No clusters , nobody on the floor . A groutyp82homesickness jumped him from behind and hung on him like an ape-girl , from that world of fur pillows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neck like a steady training partner , which he had made for and hit in any town in Europe . If he turned his head , he would surely see her topaz lanterneyes , blubbery from the smoke-tickle . A lovely gorilla girl , with a look of Jane Fonda about her little nose . Then she would get off his back , and turn into maybe a girl in a shabby greatcoat with a pile like rinsed feathers  --  Clara Rentschle , Dutch girl working for Air France as an airport-meeter for middle-aged Americans who liked to be shoe-horned into their hotels  --  saying " You 're new to Lipps . Care to join us in a kir ? " And the town would begin . Trouble was , he did n't want to go back . He wanted it to begin here . " Maybe Maeve does n't want to see us . " Or me . From as far back as summer camp , they had always written jointly , the same couple of pages , rambling over the sparse facts , and full of their dependable duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her a later plane , so we could have our talk . " " Do I see a couple of priests down there ? " A wheelchair , containing a clawy little creature in a church hat , was being pushed toward the pair by a figure in blue . No Maeve.  | " Only two ? Soon they 'll send the army . Bunt , I should warn you . You 're the one really bought this place . " " Me ? Gramp 's policy ? You 're kidding . " A twentyyearendowment for $10,000 , payable on his majority . In the load of insurance Buddy had mortgaged for his stake , that had been the only one left out . Thanks kid , it wo n't help . " My sacred promise to the old lady . To get her down here . " " You do n't mean you promised ? That we 'd convert ? " After the funeral visit , there 'd been a breath of it . If they 'd send him up there to St. Joseph'sin-the-Valley , Mother MacNeil would board the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cut her Mother 's throat first , Maeve said . " Me , they 're satisfied if I go back to being a good Jew . The church is very liberal these days . You 're the tender morsel they 're hungry for . " " Sonofa gun . " " So I 'm a rascal . Allow me , once . " They were both grinning . " How do I know I brought you up right ? I have my guilts . " " You know I 've never been anything . You took advantage of it . " " What a thing to say , you 're a nothing . No , I only took advantage you 're young . It 's your turn now . "  | " Jesus , what . a birthday present . " " You want the farm ? " Swiftly . " You can have it . I wo n't sell it , then . " Canny canny . He turned on his heel in the prie-dieu , puzzling . " Mother MacNeil loves it up here . Brings up her portable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't so false . Deuces wild , the money says to you . You have a fantasy ?  --  actit out . You can move . You 're not hemmed in . " I 'll h-have a cow , maybe . " " Fine . She 'll look just right in that dining room . " " Well , let 's go down , huh . " He took his father 's arm , as height permitted . " Maybe they 'll make a man of me . " " Of us , " Buddy said . On the bottom step , he stopped . " What are they doing about Maeve ? " His father held up his newsboy face . " For her  --  they pray . The two of them had to get all the way down the stairs to see all of it before he understood what had happened to the Bronsteins , and how rich they were . Anybody who had been reared in his collection of angles , walls , views , courtyard-juttings that almost provided the city-coveted " double exposure , " fire escapes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole mute storehouse of wistful accommodation  --  could be excused for thinkingit.  |p85The  Fifth Avenue side was all glass  --  so much of it , and so clean , it seemed all air . Maybe angels came and licked it in the early morning  --  Paulina Vespasi again , telling him why the Chrysler Building 's needle always shone so clean , " same as the Vittorio Emmanuele monument . " And the air curved and wrapped itself nonchalantly , accepting a roofline , but dispensing with smaller privileges . Outside there , the whole upper city offered itself at sunset-level , no cover-charge , a gorgeous cloud-cafeteria for all bums . Strain for more meaning at your own risk . In case of too much ardor , on the terrace beyond the windows there were parapets . To the left , where the building curved in , an open door  --  yes , that was air , like summer on his boots  --  gave on a striped party-marquee and all the fixings , white tables and spots of chrysanthemum bushes , stacked against the dusk . He had no trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of girls in front of the nearest bush . I see you , he signaled to himself . I 'll get back to you . Stay there . To his right , on the far north corner , about fourteen feet back from the angle , he saw the terrarium , a bulb of opaline glass perhaps ten feet in diameter , extruded on air again , as if the building had blown a last bubble before it gave up its climb . Outside a just-perceptible sliding-door , a life-sized porcelain lion raised its chub head . Inside , all the shapes of hothouse-green pressed lovingly toward him . They wanted to get in here , why was that ? In their center , behind lattice , vine and spike ,  |p86a  life-sized statue with its back turned  --  the old Kwan-Yin from Park Avenue Two , its ivory coif bent , looking out . Clever . No , it 's Maeve . You must know , Betts , that she was absolutely lucid . Perhaps more absolutely lucid than she had to be . Her only aberration was that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not on the hour , nothing so bald as that  --  and gaze down . Whatever was being looked at there , the former owners of such vantage points as tree-houses , captain 's walks and pergolas  --  or a small porch in the Berkshire past  --  are not required to say . She tripped out of there , not seeing him at first , in the same white wool dress and bronze shoes he and Buddy had had to applaud over and over before she could trust herself to wear them to his graduation , an event she had trained for  --  as she did for all public appearances outside their house , and some in it  --  as if she were a movie star . " There 'll be so many bigwig par/ents there . " Though nothing ever came of that for her  --  she always became ashamed of the impudence that had brought her thus far , and hung back inside the shell she had made to be looked at  --  he had been proud of her , when he saw some of the other boys ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the fathers , who in a whisper to his own son , had asked to be introduced to him . As his mother came toward him , seeing her now , it was hard to believe she was not a girl . Since he 'd last seen her , she must have given up " keeping up the red " of her hair . It was now a silvery white , brushed high off her face and clipped at the back George Washington-style , in an exaggerated version of half the girls he knew  --  why should going white make her look like a girl ? Thanks to the procession of them between her and him , he could wonder now if she had a lover  --  something in the way she looked over her shoulder and away from him  --  looking back : " Welcome to your party , " she cried toward him . There were people about ; this was for their benefit . He understood her need of falsity , compact between them since their shopping days . She fell upon him then , saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Left it with a friend . " Maeve tapped his shoulder . A little smile . " Mick mouth . "  |p88His  heels were bumped from behind . " Sor-ree ! " Too loud to be . He turned . Wheelchair croquet . The woman who was manning it shed him a hard-nosed glare from behind her navy-blue . Same as the mothers in the park : babies take precedence . Or because they had to be with the carriage all day . And you were with a girl . " Mother , this is Bunty , " Maeve said . " He 's been in Wales . " He took the little claw , half afraid it would scratch . Under her blanket , Mother MacNeil still looked like a cat they had talcumed over very neatly , and put a hat and bunioned shoes on . Her black wrinkles matched her coat . " She can understand you , but you have to bend down , " the attendant said . " She must have been a little deaf even before . Lip-reads a little . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been in Wales . " The old woman struggled to speak . Said something . " Learning to talk . " His mother said quietly . " That 's the day I leave . " " For shame , Maeve . " The attendant had a champagne glass in one hand . Whose companion was she ? " You remember Mrs. Reeves , " Buddy said behind him . " Buddy was so generous , bringing Mother here , " Maeve said at Buddy . " I thought I 'd be generous back . " He squinted , removing himself . They had neverused him like this , or had they . Maeve was looking down  --  her bronze buckles . Her shoes never showed wear . She would n't look at him . Old Reeves 's white hair had been dyed brown . A little of her backbone had gone with it . Or into the wheelchair . " I had a mother once , " Mrs. Reeves said . " For a very  --  hic  --  long time . " The light was pretty here . Acknowledge it .. Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anywherethere was a roof and a dusk . Not to be spent with old people . A waiter came up and changed their glasses , each full of light . Mother MacNeil was given a sip too . Their four faces looked at him hopefully . Yes , Bunty , this is how rich we are . " Oops , she wants to write something . " Reeves bent to his grandmother . " Well , off we go . She wo n't  --  except in the bathroom . Is n't that extraordinary ? Most people read . " " Well , I 'm off to my party . I see two possible love-objectsover there . " He touched his mother 's arm . " Watch my line , anyone ? " " Excuse me a minute . Take your father . He never knows many people here . " Buddy and he watched her open a door in the terrariumand disappear among the plants . " When a depression gets very low , Bunt , people say anything they think . The doctor says . " " Wuddya know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cheer them up.  |p90In  succession , he took three fast tries . A yellow-haired man came up , and was introduced to him as the designer of the terrarium . " Claes Hilversum here  --  have n't we met some-where ? " " You Dutch ? El Paradiso , maybe , I used to hang out there . " " That government place ? No , I have not been . I have not been a student for some years . " This was no exaggeration . " Cheapest pot in Europe , though , I hear . " He took out a wildly elegant case and angled it . " Have some . Bunty handed Buddy his glass . " Hold my bottle . " He and the blond boy , so called , lit up . " Morocco ? " Claes said , breathing close . " Rue de l'Art ? Leuwenstrasse ? Lapses like that bawthair me . We must talk . " " The M-Mowzel , " Bunt said quickly . He turned to Buddy . " English for mousehole . " Handed Claes back his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  with a suit of armor takes your hat . " " R-right , " Claes said . " What a lovely idea . " " We had a place with a suit of armor , once , remember Buddy ? Central Park West . " He and Buddy exchanged smiles . In the foyer , like a truant from the lobby , sent to guard them with its pike . One of the cousins , asking its price , had scolded , " Maeve , you could have a mink coat for that . " His mother 's report of this had become family-famous be/tween the three of them , Buddy teasing for years . At the time Bunty had n't understood why . Suspecting his mother did n't either , quite . " Imagine , " she 'd said that night at dinner . " Imagine anybody wanting a mink coat . When you could have a suit of armor . " Maeve , just returning , slipped under Bunty 's arm . The way she smiled , she understood it now . " The armor ? Wish we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrarium . " " Why ? " Keep it going , if you ca n't cheer . " She 'd like to put everything in there , " Buddy said . " Last week that little safe with the jewelry . Thought it would be a swell place for it . And this week , another load of plants . " They 'd bought the jewel-safe , an imposing manydraweredaffair , in the gift shop , their first trip on the Michaelangelo  --  the most expensive item there . Since then Buddy put something into it any anniversary handy ; it must be crammed . Mostly with the diamonds she was indifferent to  --  " I always feel I 'm only boarding them . " There was also the pale Ceylon ruby she 'd told the cousins was a tourmaline , more gold junk she never wore , and the small pearls which were her emblem . She had them on now , hung with the opal she did love , and called her bad-luck-piece . Was it crazy to keep that stuff out there ? Or smart ? Claes puffed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I told you . That drome is built for a lifetime  --  all right , alI right . But to a certain stress . " " You said we could even dance in it . "  | " So you can  --  I 've built twenty-five of them . They respond to motion in the usual way . And take any reasonablebearing weight . But they have an overload point like anyplace . " He turned to Bunty , flashing teeth . " Like those waterbeds in your old brownstones here , too dangerous , do n't you agree ? " And to Buddy . " This is the first attached to poured concrete . Give me the key , Maeve , will you . I 'd better check . " She unhitched a dainty one , fitted somehow on her belt . They watched him unlock . The doorcurve could n't be distinguished from the rest . Copied from Bucky Fuller , he would guess . Beautifully executed . " Why lock it ? " " Doughty pries in there and lifts a leg , " his father said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New dog , then . " Must be some dog . " They could see a vague outline of Claes inside , bendingand touching . Funny how anything inside there looked as if it were struggling to get out . Claes came back , handing Maeve the key . " Looks all right , I must say . New plants look groggy , better feed them . See you did take out the Chinese porcelains . Bulls and lions your mother had in there , Bunty . And a Kwan Yin . Terrible example of one . Like a diplomat in drag . " " I miss her company . " Maeve touched her own hair . " She 's in a nearby closet , though . And the safe , Buddy . I took out that . "  | " Where 'd you put it ? " " Sent it to the office . Care of Blum . " " To Blum ? What did you do that for ? " " Not to her , Buddy . Care of . Is n't that what secretariesare for ? " His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The temporary-starvation style that girls got when they went thin . " Well , ta-ta all , " Claes sighed . " God , I do beautiful work . You see the piece on it in Art News  --  ' L'art nouveau nouveau ' ? Sure you do n't want to back me , Mr. Bronstein ? I 'd love to be a Limited . Or even an Inc . " " No thanks , Claes , I told you . This way it stays art . That way  --  you 're only a supplier . " " What a fate . Well , nice to have met you again , Bunty , we must get together . " " See you at the Mowzel . " " That lovely place . But we need n't go so far . " He slouched across the room to a Rothko , slid the panel aside , and slipped out . Buddy watched , scowling . " I think he has an effeminate interest in you , Bunt . " He was touched . Buddy could be as naive as Maeve . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come from ? " " It 's English . Like the Mowzel . " " What 's the Mowzel ? " Buddy said sullenly . " One of those haunts ? " " I made it up . " Maeve laughed.  |p94A  bad pause then . Why should that be ? Maybe they were n't looking to him to cheer them . Maybe the dog did it now . " Chickie , Bunt , " his father said suddenly . " Here come the cops . " The two priests were coming their way . " You sicked ' em on me . " Was n't like his father , to play both ends through the middle . He reached up and slid the yarmulka , still on his own head , forward and sideways . Half and half . " Father Melchior , my son Quentin , " Maeve said . Quentin . Was she so impressed with the cloth after all , then ? Or only with the father himself , a huge man with an oversized , fresco face . She looked inquiringly up at the other one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Archie Dunham , ma'am , " the second one said , looking down even on Bunty , from an elegant , yellowskinnedface that sat like a finial on his seven-foot bones . " But I reckon your son and I already know each other . " This time it was true . " You were graduating the year I came . " He 'd been the basketball star at Bunt 's last prep school . And their star black . " You ordained already ? " " Seminarian . Like you ? " " What ? Oh , you mean my hat ? Just my at-home hat . You know , like a smoking jacket . " " Smoke ? " Archie offered his pack . " Thanks , I do n't . " He laughed at himself , and upp95at Archie , much too hard . How explain his elation ? Fancy meeting you , anybody , here . Maybe the town had begun . " You were swimming team , were n't you ? " " Second string . " " Hear you 're going to be an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a curator before I took orders . In Denmark . Hear you been in Bruges and Amsterdam . See any of my favorite churches ? See St. Sauveur ? " Clearly they knew everything about him . Maybe Archie had even been sent . " No , guess I only saw girls . " He reached out to touch Buddy 's arm . " Not to worry . " He took advantage of the pause . " One I knew in London , her father wrote a history of the Vatican . " Why did he always feel he had to talk Catholic to Catholics ? " I think I know that book " Melchior said . " Came out in the fifties . And of the author . Very old family in the church , they are . Since Henry the Eighth . " " Uh-huh . Lots of yummy childhoods , they talk about . " They 'd talked about hers all night , in the family house on the edge of Paddington . With her , it had been like foreplay ; every time he touched a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had jumped out . None of her family was home though , and toward dawn , when she 'd been finishing a raunchy tale of what the girls had once dreamed up at St. Hilda 's , he 'd had reasonable hopes . Then the family sheep dog hadp96walked in , a ringer for Peter Pan 's , and the night was over . Always woke her for breakfast , the dear pet did  --  ever since she was a child . " I think we use that book at the seminary , " Archie said . " Approved by the Vatican , I understand , " Bunty said . " But banned in Ireland . " He had n't made that up , just retained it . Hopefully . He looked down . Maeve was gone again . It was like a tic . For the second time he watched her take up the key at her waist , rest her hand on the knob for a moment , then enter , closing the door 's perfectly bent line behind her , her shadow diffusing behind the plants . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her head  --  could she be crossing herself ? Once , on his own plea during a shopping day , she had taken him into St. Patrick 's . During all the bobbing and ducking she had n't done anything , only explained some of it to him . He had wanted to light a votive candle , but she would n't let him . Maybe her body remembered the old actions , vaguely repetitive . In time of need . " Going to Ireland myself next year . " " Are you , Mr. Dunham ? " Buddy was watching her too . " What 'll you be doing there ? " " Serving , I hope . " Archie looked modestly down . " At least neither side will mistake me for the other . " God , but he was token . " Uh-huh , easier than atbasketball . " At once , Bunty 's head dropped his chestfor shame , but this time nothing came out . He lookedp97up to find Melchior observing him . " What are the s-stationsof the Cross ? I always wondered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you , and I 'll tell you . " Melchior took pencil and pad out of a pocket and wrote the address for him . " By the way , your grandmother gave me this to give to you . " He handed over a folded slip of lined paper . " Wonderful , how she is dealing with her infirmity . " He put it in his pocket unread . Mail of any kind meant obligation . " Do n't you want to read it ? " the Dane said . " Private , " Bunty said . " She composes in the bathroom . " Buddy 's shoulders shook  --  maybe this was what he had wanted of him . " Well excuse me  --  I must go round the other guests . " He went toward Maeve . " Well , excuse me . " Bunty said . " I promised to go back to those girls over there . " Miracle , they were still together over there . " Bye , Archie . Keep the faith . " He shook the Dane 's big business-like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the room he blushed for that , but did n't look back . " Place looks like Pompeii , does n't it ? " A passing voice said . Not to him : " the evening before . " He did n't turn round . His parents had always given parties that seemed born to be hostless . And were duly snubbed for it . He could see what the voice meant . The room he had crossed , on a tide of red carpet that hadp98penetrated every corner like stage blood , had two mantels  --  oneat either end  --  both of palely chased palacemarble . No fireplaces went with , but over one mantel hung a great toothy vagina , in whose sculped vortex a whole half of an ill-advised man could be received . In front of the other , a plaster-cast workman , whose lineaments were more true-to-life than flesh was , mused over a lunch-bucket under a Tiffany lamp . He felt that both sculptures were there to reassure him that the natural functions were all right . To his left , the huge abstracts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have looked awful here  --  classical . Loose usage of Pompeii though  --  to which Emilio had taken him , round the little rouged rooms , pale with fright , in which you could feel the owners , blown clear of luxury . " Look ! " Emilio had said . " We still eat from a pot like that . " Of pots that lasted like that , you could be proud . Two women , taking champagne from the same tray a waiter offered him , were talking about the rug on top of the red carpet . " Handmade , wonder who ? " Toneless , asymmetric , it had been kept on since the second Park Avenue place , as a work of art . Nobody had ever copulated on it , far as he knew . " V-vsoske , " he said politely . A name to stick in the head . Like Silveira , the scrimshaw carver . Maeve 's first suppliers , clubbily and constantly referred to , remained in his memory like habitues of the house . The woman stared . " Over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  | " Thought you asked for whiskey . " He bowed , like the Polish Ambassador should , and walked toward it , pocketing his yarmulka on the way . Keeping his head down kept the voices disembodied. "  --  compassionate . " A male one . " Doctor says I have to be . Or else it 's bad for me . " Fine , you do that . That 's progress . In a corner he shared the joke with his champagne . Nobody had ever talked people here , much . One could n't expect it . Jasmin said it was n't done much any more in America , or even in New Zealand , where she came from . General attitudes and pursuits had taken over , like bombing and sports . Hoping for better , she had married a psychiatrist  --  but he was too old for it . And by profession a people-changer , which was n't the same thing . The only people you could trust to be interested in themselves for themselves were the young , she said . Four years older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but watched herself like a movie for signs of mental age . " Pomp is the worst . It creeps . " Bunty 's tic would help save him , she said . The husband had told her to come back when she stopped confusing him with her ideas . " See the difference between him and ideas , he meant . He 's never confused . " Now and then she did go back . But inevitably , an idea cropped up . " You do n't do that with me , " he 'd said , looking round him for her ideas . Her place was one of the few he liked , as a place . Random . She was the kind of personp100other people gave stuffed animals to . That they wanted themselves . A largish kangaroo , brought by someone who had thought New Zealand was the same as Australia . Two small teddies , mating in dust , though the rest of the place was clean enough . A grass basket given her by someone at the archeological museum where she 'd worked before coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a poisonous but very timid spider , called a katipo . And over the headboard a woodblockshe had once bought , a scene of a rainy day , whose slanting rain-lines had to be well stared at before he saw these were words . All the same one . She had a broad pansy-face , with almost invisible eyebrows that clenched exactly like that flower . " No , I do n't , do I. " She smiled up at him  --  a long , warm mold of small-print calico , pressed beneath him . Greenery-yallery , she called it . Almost all the girls that year had been wearing it . Last year . " I did n't say it , Bunt . You . " " I do n't stick , " he 'd said to her sometime before that . " It 's the way I move . " He always said that to them carefully , not for brass but because it felt true . Never telling them how they all stuck , in the marvelous meatpackinglarder that was his brain . On the West Side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a runway open to the river , where you saw the men , the torsos and the meathooks , neat in the early morning . Once , passing there , he told her . How his girl-memories were all stacked up like that ,  |p101not  murdered but treasured , because in the abattoir of memory they were all the same one  --  to whom each time he had said , " This is for once . " The car had nearly mounted Grant 's Tomb with their laughter . " You save us all ? "  --  " Sure , no guilt . Because no heads . " He did n't tell her that this formal lineup took the place of all those whom he had n't expected life to take away from him . He did explain that it had a permanence , or was achievingone . " So has Don Juan 's , " she said moodily , laughter gone . They had a fight . The most frightening thing is permanence , he tried to tell her , not because you are locked in  --  but because there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be locked in . They 'd made up . He was only thinking of calling her because he was in America , and could call . The terrace was as reassuring as an ad  --  nobody on it but a butler looking morosely at his hands , who snapped to at the sight of trade . And the two glossies . How marvelously repetitive girl-types could be . He already doted on that dent where the brown haired one 's waist was , having often guided it over crosswalks , squeezed it any number of situations , and lain with his head in its concave . She had on an armless jerkin , pants , a pouch at the waist , and a tan . A tan swimmer , she would be , with a nice temper . The other girl 's hair silveredand spun on itself , with one little flip waiting to be tugged ; under it was the kind of dazzled eye and loose lip-gleam that made her hard to focus on  --  therep102was even a 1920's-in-Berlin look about her fuzzy dress and frappe color ; she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Inside her very possibly was a slum . What fun it was . He was always wrong . The air on terraces was always carbonated  --  with height was it ? People on them became drugged into temporary well-being , like on a beach . Tonight the clouds were whistling  --  he heard them . Gomorrah looked good from here . Walking up to the two girls , he felt sinuous , as if his underwear had changed to silver . " Be twins , " he said , the backs of his hands prickling . " Then I can choose blind . " " We thought you 'd never get here , " the brown one said . " I 'm Dina , this is Maureen . Have some champagne , it 's free . " " She thinks you 're crashing . " The blond one smiled at him . " Do n't you ? " " She thinks you work here , " the brown one said . " Do n't you ? " Maureen asked . " Not yet . " " Or maybe you 're with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet . " " We are . " Maureen was the straightforward one  --  it was just the hair . " Maureen is  --  she works for Art Galaxy ; I just hung along . " " We heard there was going to be a buffet . "  | " A hot one . " Dina said . " Oh , there will be . Hot meatballs . Hot shrimp . " He tried to see the place in their light . About his age , but not like the girls he 'd known here . Not school-types . High school , and then jobs , it would be . Job jobs , with no auras to them . No teaching in the most unique nursery school in Cambridge , like Monica Ellsworth  --  hah , he 'd remembered her name . Applecheeks . The speed freak . " You crash regular ? " Dina . " I j - just got back today . " He did n't want to own up to this place . " I told you , Maureen . Din ' I ? He has that overseas look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ d'oeuvre in front of the impassive barman . Scooped up two . " My boyfriend , he 's been back since months . " Ever since she lost her job , they 'd been eating by following the crash lists . " You look in the papers for club activities ; you call the magazines . Sometimes the designers ' shows , even . " The freeload list was endless . " Gee , is n't New York wonderful ? " Where was she from ? She scooped up a salmonroundand a deviled egg . " How anybody can like caviar . Hmm ? Oh  --  Lindenhurst . " Maureen came from the Bronx . " We live in a project . A good one though . " Parkchester . Her folks ' name was Breitwieser . " Wish Arnie could see this place . " Her intended . She was working at Galaxy because Arniep104wanted to be in art . Right now he was working as a baker for her father . Her mother did hand-knits for the big stores . " Her mother knits all her clothes . Naturally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a spark there . " What a fab place . I wish Arnie . Who lives here ? " They both looked at him expectantly . " Ordinary people . " He felt frightened . It was true . And he might be ashamed of it . " Come on , must be some tycoon  --  look at the appetizers . " Dina patted a last one down . " Now I 'll wait for the buffet . " Her friend was meeting her here . Then they 'd all four go out to Maureen 's . She and the friend had met Maureen at a guru lecture Saturday , in Town Hall . " Nourishment , ' the ad said . But it turned out to be spiritual . " " You into yoga , Maureen ? " He was surprised . " My study group went . It 's very popular . " Her soft , almost r-less accent ran the words together . Ve-wee . He would take it from her tongue like a caramel . Would her intended ? She saw him looking at her tiny diamond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's for where you can add to it . As you work up . " " What 'll you add ? " " Baguettes . " The word wet her lip like a rainbow . " Excuse me , " she said , " but do you know where the bathroom is ? " He did n't , down here . " Let 's ask him . " " Back of the kitchen , there 's one , " the butler said.  |p105Hired  for the day . He looked like an old prizefighter . Tight in the blazer , worn . What was it like to stand by , not listening ? The man took Maureen 's champagne glass as she went . " Get off the ice . " The girl Dina , at his elbow , whisperingit . " What do you mean ? " " What I said . This is our trick , Fred 's and mine . She 's going to ask us home . For the night . " As the two women he 'd spoken to before ambled to the drink table , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , facing him , dug a steel finger in his rib , swept a small salver 's contents into her pouch , already open , then took a second look at the little tray , pinched that too , and stared up at him like a sprung cat . He 'd never seen it done before . Common occurrence . Way his knife must have gone . Made the party seem closer . " Thought Freddie was coming here . " " Fred , to you . No , he wo n't make the rounds . Only in the park . I 'll call him where he waits , tell him to meet us there . He 's like  --  you know  --  still in ambush ... You came out pretty good , did n't you ? " The party was more crowded now , people coming in through doors of rooms still unknown to him . Anybodyin ambush , would have to be careful here . He could n't see his parents anywhere . Buddy was always hard to find in a crowd . From here , the terrarium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was in ? "  |p106She  shrugged . " Dime a dozen . Wait and see . You got a place ? " He nodded . " Do n't crowd us then , see . Maybe you can turn a trick here . " " Maybe . " Now that she was closer , he smelled the cold , leathery odor of people who bedded outside or anywhere , of himself two nights ago . He could only smell it because he was here . " Does Freddie  --  Fred  --  trick in the park ? " " Trade , you mean ? You would n't say that , he was here . He 'd knock you off . " Suddenly she perked her tam ; the two women were passing . " He makes his own kind of rounds , " she said airily . " You thinking of it ? You do n't look right for it . You do n't know how , you might knock somebody off for good . " She shivered . The steel finger went in his ribs again . Her trick , maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thronged around them . " What are you going to do ? At the Breitweisers ? " " Take a bath . Sleep . Be in a house . " She crossed her arms and clutched her shoulders . " If I can get him in a house . We got kicked out of my residence club . I snuck him in . Oh , all the girls do it ; these days a management winks . But Fred . . . sometimes he 's still pretty animal . They threw us out . " She looked up at Bunty . " Not sex , you know . No , no , no  --  if you want the sad truth . But hotels are no good to him , even flophouses . He always makes for the park . To jobhuntp107from there , it 's hard . And I du n no , nine to five gets harder , the longer you do n't . So I figure , get him in a house . Get that organized . " She bent , cleaning the nail of her mid-finger with that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storm , once . Felipe 's Fred . Maybe that intended of hers will get him a union card . She says bakers are n't the same as foodhandlers but she 'll try . " She smiled suddenly , walked over the table , took up a loaded tray and held it out to him . " So lay off . " " Guess you could n't go back to Lindenhurst . " A statement of kinship . Nobody he knew could . " You kidding ? I knew a German girl from there , once . He saw how green he was . " Fred and me both come from the Coast , we worked a spa there . I did . Oh on the up-and-up , in the sauna , a receptionist even . I got him on as a poolcleaner . An elegant joint . Only when the customers saw me with a Chicano , my share of the tips stopped . So Felipe and I worked our way east . " His eyes unfocused , over the devotion of women . And on Maureen , wending her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the cocktail way . She was bantering with him . But even from here it was plain she still had her eye on the baguettes . Buxom in her woolly , she looked like a nice pink house . " Listen Dina , " he said hurriedly . " I 've got a wad  --  made hay in a crapgame last night . Here , take some ; do n't go out there . " He peeled off two hundredp108left from what Buddy had last sent him . " To the Bronx , I mean . " " Jesus . " She held it in front of her . " Put it away . " Across the floor , Buddy was waving at him , pushing gently through the crowd . Maureen , going toward the library now for some reason , must in a moment bump into him . And the two of them  --  into Dina and him . Lines of force . There must be about sixty people at his birthday party ; with luck , he would hear the life-story of only two . " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hots for Maureen , huh ? " " I 've already got a girl . " " I 'll bet . " " Why latch onto her , that 's all . She 's her kind of nice girl , that 's all . And you know what her folks would be . " Dina raised her eyelashes . " Like mine . Just because you saw me pinch the dinky tray , huh . " The money was still in her hand . " Here . " " No , take it anyway . " " You want me to scram , huh . How ? " " You could go to the bathroom . And not come back . " " And leave her in a lurch ? That 's worse is n't it  --  than going out there ? " " Would it be ? " She would n't look at him . " I 'll send her home in cab . " " Oh . Like good girls get . And what 's in it for you ? "  |p109What  was ? At the parties he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the parties were for . Though being in style made it harder . " I do n't know . " She smiled down at the money . " You just like Felipe . Impractical . " " Am I ? " He started to be pleased . " Get it from those Asians . That 's what . Okay Jesus , here comes somebody . " She flipped open the pouch at her waist , thought better of it . Smiled like a movie-still . " Dinner 's being served , " his father said . " In the dining car . " At parties Buddy still went blackface . Poor guy , a marked man . City College , circa 1945 . " We 're enjoying your party , sir . " He prayed his father would think this was the way he was with girls . " This is Dina . " She held out a graceful , empty hand . She must have stashed it . Had Buddy seen  --  in time ? " I 'm  --  er , C-Carroll Monteith , sir . " Bunty said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father what he hoped was the high sign . Of a man who had just made an arrangement . Yale School of Architecture , 1976 . " Pip-pip , " Buddy said , raising his brows . " Good-oh . Quick journey , Mr. , er  --  Monteith . Visit , I mean . Will we see you again ? Later this evening perhaps . " He turned on his heel , his shoulders angry . " He knows we crashed , " she said . " Let 's go , " he said , sunk . " I 'll go find Maureen . You go the other way . " " Bye . "  |p110He  stopped short . It was always so final . " Bye . " But Maureen was nowhere to be found . He circled back to the terrace , in case Maureen had . Dina was still there . He saw she knew . She took his arm . " She left a pink stole in that roomover there , when we came in . Let 's go check . " There was n't much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ umbrella , a few scarves . It was still summer . " No , she scrammed . Guess I told her too much . " Dina swung around nonchalantly , scanning . " Guess thisis the library . No books . But it always is . " She was shivering . " Want me to get you a wrap ? " She laughed . " Where ? " " I 'll find something . " Maeve left furniture behind like successive skins , but saved everything she had ever worn . Like skin . " That your racket ? No thanks . When the leaves turn , maybe . Then maybe I 'll come back for mink . " She did a time-step . " Gee , a song . . . Do n't think we have n't thought of it . " " Have n't got a racket . Yet . " " Well , do n't start one here , the barman 's onto us . He said he 'd seen me before . I think he 's a Pinkerton . " " What 's that ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To watch . " She came up to him , tugged his jacket . " I was going to scram . All by myself . Could n't you see that ? Want your money back ? "  | " Is Freddie real ? Fred I mean . Felipe . " It took her a while . " He has a bad sphincter muscle . And a citation . But they still throw him out for it . He soils sheets . And her mother hand-knits them , probably . " " Do you really sleep in the park ? " " Not always . Last night we did . Near the chess place . It depends . Sometimes I can get him to check in somewhere . If he has a stake . Sometimes somebody asks us in . In the corner there was a flowered sink , with a wastebasket underneath . He watched her empty the leather pouch , daintily clean it out , fill the washbowl again and sink into it to her upper arms . The soap was perfumed . She inhaled deeply . " Luxury is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times out , seeing a pretty woman wash . There would always be a little more to this one 's story than she said . Or a little less . It was attractive , the way laziness was . And crummy bars . And runt dogs . " No , please keep the money . But I 'd love to know where you stashed it . I could n't figure out . " She picked up her tam by its button and held it aloft . The money wafted slowly past her grave face , and down . For some reason , that killed him . Her too . A feeling that felt it could shed itself , pressed them together . Not misery but the excitement that came of it , more from her , but some from him . Under her dress shep112had nothing on  --  when he looked surprised , she murmured , " Threw them away this morning . They threw themselves away . My pants . " As he closed with her , he murmured back , " No , I 'm just always surprised it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He should have locked the door first , but no one came in anyway . What he 'd meant about shape was that women who came on like a pack of assorted . . . cared  --  deuces and treys , eights and aces  --  ought to show it down there somehow . What did it matter . Almost at once he was able to offer his handkerchief to tuck between her legs . She did that . Locked against his chest , she listened to what could n't get out of there , the heart he wanted to be proud of . Holding her head , he heard the tears that could n't fall . This was the kind of girl he always got . She was at the sink again when she said , " I wanted to be in a house , that 's all . " " I was overseas . But not with the war . " When they left the room she had the silver salver in her hand ; she had polished it . " I 'll leave it with the Pinkerton . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of the Nevelson . She came back , dreamily . " He was n't there . But he 'll know . He saw me take it . Anyway , I wo n't be coming back here . " " Wait . " He ran back through the house and up the stairs . The bedrooms were new to him , but much the same . In the one that must be Maeve 's , he went straight to the double armoire where her coats would be . Therep113they were , in a sequence like a memory , all the way back to the department stores . He chose one from somewhere before the middle of them  --  brown and thick , not seen for a long time . Then switched it for a prettier one , with fur . Down the back way , he met no one . She was still standing there . Something she must have done to herself while he was away had made her look to him as she had in the beginning . Women never looked too bad when they were waiting like that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . " For winter . " Locking her thumbs in the coat 's lapels , she hung on . She knew when not to say anything . Did she suspect he did n't have to leave ? What did she think of him , more or less ? Downstairs , under the canopy , she bent back , gazing up at it . White , with three twined initials in gold braid . Like a monogrammed sheet . " Get me a cab ? " He ran for one . Fifth Avenue had none ; he picked up one on Madison , rode it back and jumped out just in time . She was just walking away , head down . Toward the park . " You have to expect more , " he said , grabbing her . She let him tuck her in . When he gave the driver some bills , she glowed . " He wants to know where . " She could go to a hotel . But of course she knew that . Leaning forward , she told the driver to go down Columbus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ap114bar called the Lotos , on the west side of the street . " No , maybe seventy-third . I 'll show him where . " Freddie Felipe could trust her still . Her shrug was merry . " Our bathroom and kitchen facilities . We walk to it . " He reached through the window to squeeze her hand . " Check you at the Lotos , sometime . " " What are you , a talent scout ? " As the cab pulled away , though , she leaned out and gave him the sign he 'd gone around the world with . Be with it . Right on . Peace . Whatever you took it to be . He 'd made her happy then , or generous . He took it that he still could be proud of his heart . Upstairs again , waiting for someone to come and deal with the three locks that told who the Bronsteins were , he still smiled , for the generalized love that only the ones who were his age , stamping forward and along the old lottery paths , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door was having trouble . For the moment while the locks clicked ; numberone  --  human manual , number two  --  electronic Siamese , number three  --  a soft slatching , like the roller-bearingsat Dachau , he ducked into one of his mowzels and wasback with his own kind . Damphaired fur , close rawhide , thong and toe , calico smoke . Wherever the drumthumps , the poetry machines are grinding for the night . The swish of the snares , seineing the bottoms for nomeaning , is always a beach sound . What-ho the bonnycrevices of all the wars you 're not going to . Heave-to , to the bonny advices of all the girls who are not ashamedp115of it . Lie down with us , in the drag-wail of the dixie cups . Onka-bonka , what a boss drummer . Going to the front , onka-bonka . Right here . His father opened the door to him . " ' Bout time . She 's got a birthday cake . " Down the years , he and Bunt had disavowed the sentiment of it , two boys together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the necessary halls to the dining room , he swung a locker-room arm up and over Bunt 's shoulder . " Do n't want to butt in , you and girls , Bunt . Far from . But at your age , I sure hate to see money have to change hands . " They had stopped dead anyway . He slipped Buddy 's arm off . Size had never been a sorrow between them . But it was time his father dealt with all six-and-a-half feet of him . " Be a Montefiore , Buddy ? Not aRothschild ? " Sure , he had hit him . Maybe it was time to say anything . Without being depressed . The dining room , full up now , was a shock . All those faces , hanging over the pink-linen trough the main table had been made into , bobbling at him monkey-eyed , ass-chinned , kitty-smooching , diminishing down the room in one of those longshots cameramen took kneeling , out of some nice A-rated movie that had broken its guarantee not to turn into a dream . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like some other animal than our brand . They all looked like they knew their own ravages . And were counting on a good boy likep116him to be the kinder for it . They were still in the saddle  --  andhe had better watch it ; they wanted to take him along . Oh , he knew where he was , all right . Maybe the women were n't decked out like the Brooklyn of those days , but he knew the smell of those salted almonds . The wine in these glasses might be a little better , and technically this was n't a hall  --  but after all , he was older than the usual candidate . Just then , Doughty pranced in and up to him . A Harlequin Dane was n't his style , up to now not the Bronsteins ' either , but a dog is a dog . An animal that is an animal . He fed him a couple of almonds , making the picture they were planned to . " Doughty , " he said to the cocked ear , " bet you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd been seated at the big table 's far end , his parentsat the other . Looking down the line , he saw that Maeve 's " do " had n't changed much  --  the people maybe , but not their categories . Leskel , the man on his left , was the one who had asked to meet Buddy , at his own graduation . The lady on his right , a nice camel with big droopy eyes , said , " We 're in your parents ' box . " The opera . On her right was a big tawny-haired man Leskel introduced as Dr. Somebody . The hair long for these parts . Or for him . On Leskel 's left , the gal who had admired the rug informed him she was from Maeve 's class at the Alliance Francaise . His parents had n't thank God placed him between the two of them . There were no place cards . " Just sprinkle , " was what Maeve wouldp117have said , or Buddy . There was n't that much time , to know who your friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye on her . " The best gilt glasses , Buddy . I see you kept those . " His father was pouring him wine . The glasses were from the last place , and really something . They 'd never drunk from them before . " When it gets to be art , you can keep it on , " his father said . " All the years it took to find that out . Somethingis gone though . Thought you 'd notice right out . " " Never thought you noticed I noticed . . . It would 've looked like fool , with that harpsichord . " " Would it ? Anyway , I saved it . You 'll see . That little Kranich &; Bach has integrity . " Buddy winked . He winked back . Like he knew his father was a tried man . " Okay , saved by a piano . " He put a hand on Buddy 's shoulder , locker-room style . " Okay , we 're still in love . " Leskel was envying them . His hair still had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impressionist . " You know my boy Johnny ? He 's living with a girl . " That 's Johnny-boy . " Not to worry . " Bunt said . " They all come from very good families . " " Oh , I know . " Leskel brightened . " The mother and father came to look us over . To plead us to do something . When they saw how we lived  --  they calmed down . We even had a foursome of bridge . Best partners Dollie and I ever had . " " Maybe they 'll make it legal someday . "  | " Think there 's a chance ? " " The foursome ? Oh  --  the best ' . ' He leaned forward ; a glint had caught his eye . But the tawny man had turned his back . Mrs. Camel was waiting for Bunt 's regard . " I saw the way you looked at us . Ca n't blame you . But wait ' til it 's your turn . " She had a smiling competence he recognized , but could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wo n't mind so much getting old . If I can get my life right . But I 'll hate it for the girls I know . " " Oh , they 'll manage . " When she laughed , the eyes lifted . The red hair looked real as his own . " You just stop being a girl . " He saw Maeve slip out again . " You look a little like a girl I knew . " Monica 's eyes went that way , already . " But with her anything can happen . She 's a speed freak . " " Oh , so are mine . All six of them . The situation around our house is terrible . Eight cars of course . But then , four Hondas and a hovercraft . Plus the two planes . " Some mothers  --  that 's what he 'd recognized . Where there were a lot of kids , like once . She could hang on , or let go ; whether or not she knew the score , she was the center of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You married ? I mean  --  " He blushed . She exploded . So did he . " I mean you 're not a widow or anything . "  | " My husband flew us in . I expect he 's in Honduras by now . " " Airline pilot ? " She smiled a no . " Revolutionary ? " " You are a romantic , are n't you . " " No , a wit . I mean , who else would have six kids . Except maybe the Kennedys . " " He owns the airline . " " Oh , that 's right . Silly of me . " The opera box . They were rich enough to have six kids , not poor enough to . And Maeve 's pick-up 's husbands so often had businesselsewhere .

Maybe she did n't know that yet ; maybe she thought he did n't . Asking is the flattery . More than anything . He would n't though.  |p120No  one over thirty , so far . So far , no one over twenty-six , which is what Jasmin is . Keep the bloodlines clear. 1 " I 'm scared I 'll be too adjustable , that 's all . It 's the one thing scares me blue . " " Your principles , you mean ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rings with a tycoonesscool that made him think less of her . You could commit hara-kiri on anyone of them . But she had asked . I " I 'm only romantic about what I want . Or I will be . Not over the rest of it . " She closed her eyes and said something to herself . Jesus , he thought it was . Appropriate , for a convert . On her right , the big fellow Leskel had introduced as Doctor , leaned forward . " I hear you say you want to live right ? " " Listen , I was only trying to say anything . Anything ! il I really thought . It was an experiment . " " How 'd it work out ? " j , Bunty looked him over closer . In profile , the man 's hedge of hair really vibrated up , like an electric shoebrusherwith a kind forehead . Or a man on the hotseat , smiling all the same . " Too easy , if you want to know . When a place is not your style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " ti " You do n't like it here ? " she interrupted . " The son of the house ? " South American curves on top she had , and under the table what he 'd bet would be long coe - tryclubstems . He had a suspicion that , closer to forty , whichp121she must be , the attraction was that the parts did n't match . But what he wanted to see was that doctor 's ear . " Everybody has his own way of dwarfing the world , " he said , low . " This just is n't mine . " " Where do you want to go ? " The doctor 's voice . Back to where it hurts , is Jasmin 's idea . She saidshe intends to spend the rest of her life there . He raised his eyes . " You our new family doctor ? " " Partly . " He had a way of listening in profile , eyescocked sideways . Like a teaching nun . Or a monk . Orone of the children at their skirts . Right on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winced . And there it was , the thin gold wire in the bush of his sideburn . Like one more gold hair , thickened with listening . There could n't be two of them with that in an ear . Should he ask , or leave it be . Choose . " You 're Janacek , are n't you ? The child psy-chologist ? " He bowed . " And you are Bunt . " Who floats in Buddy 's mind , like a hovercraft ? " How 'd you come to know  --  us ? " Leskel spoke . " Through us . " He was stunned at the way it could work out . And encouraged . Chance can happen . Good or bad , you have to cherish it . " Are n't you a child psychiatrist ? " Another bow . " Sometimes the children are  --  grown . You know my work ? "  | " I  --  knew one of them . " Janacek smiled , but did n't ask who . Probably gets it all the time ; there are so many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It did n't take a minute , to dovetail her story with this bowing man 's . And feel for both of them . " A dirty story he had nothing to do with , " she said . " Ten years old at Buchenwald , Bunt  --  Long Island is full of them . And Washington Heights . " But his mother had been a camp guard . And was still alive . Until recently . He wore the wire , Jasmin said , for kids to focus on . And it 's true , Bunt  --  you look at it , in that hair , and you 're back in fairyland where the grass has eyes , and there 's a gold ring in the pond . " He has very strong lines of force , " she said , " but he does n't hurt enough , anymore . " He was exerting them . " Like to talk to you , Bronstein . About your parents . And you of course . " K-k-k , Bronstein . The story attracts you . " S-sorry . Thanks though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head of the table , Buddy tapped a fork against a glass . It rang true , of course . " There 's my majority coming up . Let 's leave it at that . " " You could help so . " " I plan to . " " Why not let me help you to ? " " Hold it , Kid Bronstein , " Buddy had seen Maeve was gone . " A slight delay . Practice your speech . "  |p123He  saluted . " Coming , Father ! " Buddy and Ike 's favorite comic , the early days . A comic son . " You 're a very interesting young man . You could help me . " He puts his empathy right in your hand , Jasmin says . He has to have you have it . That 's why she left ; that 's why she goes back . It 's the secret of his success with the kids , she said . He 's non-rejectable . He could try . " Thanks . But I do n't think you 're the teddy bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flesh shows no prints . At least , mine does n't yet . And maybe she never went back to him . But the echoes of people in one another last on and on . As is my hope . " We  --  have met ? " Echoes were the man 's trade , after all . He could pass it up . Chance strolled by him , a gainly dog ; he gave it his hand to bite . " Yes , we have , Dr. Jannie . In a launderette . You came by with Jasmin 's check . " Janacek knew her habits , she said , and could n't give the habit up . In bed after , in the room paid for by the check perhaps , he 'd felt uneasy , but she 'd said not to ; she did n't need the money , really . Let Jannie think he was protecting her . She let him come back sometimes  --  yes , into bed even  --  because she was the only one with whom he could be a child . Theyd agreed not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ views . " It'sp124a rotten sell for kids these days . I sha n't have one . " She 'd agreed to have Jannie though , not knowing . " You ca n't desert a child , " she said , laughing , and tugged at his own red hair . " Kangaroo-oo . " To his right , Mrs. Camel , mother of six , was now talking seriously with Leskel , who had moved around to her . They look so grown , most of them , no matter what 's inside . Opposite him , Janacek 's earring glinted , joining him to childhood . Perhaps one day , Bronstein himself would find himself wanting one . Janacek was staring at him . " Yes , she spoke of you . Many times . Ah , yes . " " How is Jasmin these days ? I should call her up . " Sorry  --  I 'm always rude when I have to wear a tie . " How long have you been away , Bronstein ? " " Nine months . Wrote her from Paris . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote back . " " Poor boy . " Janacek grasped him by the jacket . " Sitdown . " His father was chiming at his glass again . The table straightened and took up the chime , old dinosaurs chocking their bow ties sideways at the guest of honor  --  a dowager iguana , a donkey with the usual whimsical specs . Cows were harder to come by . In a pinch might two priests do ? One black , one white . " Ca n't now . What 's up ? " Janacek sat down . Slowly . It came to him then . What it must be . Of course.  |p125Underneath  the din , he said it aloud . " She 's pregnant . That it ? And it 's mine . " For five seconds , hilarity had me . Report that as my reaction to fatherhood . Not everybody can find that out beforehand . At his own bar mitzvah . And as a candidate for the Catholic Church . In retrospect it seems a long time . Farce would have been so lovely . Of God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward him . Five seconds more were awarded me . In which I called Jasmin up . His earring brushed me then . I recoiled . His eye had passed me on the way , an old red searchlight . " She fell in Bryant Park , an anti-war day crowd . The autopsy showed a very light skull . " The glasses went on chiming true . " To our son on his twenty-first , " my father said . Maeve had come back . He raised his glass to me . The first time I 'd seen him so , he 'd been in his first custommadetux , toasting himself in a mirror as the best dressed goddam penguin he ever saw  --  and I 'd bawled with an eight-year-old 's rage because it was so true-not-true . " To my son . Not a prodigal . But returned . "  |p126Buddy  is a graceful man . Grace , past or present , breaks me up . Program me in now , Betts . Betts ? There was a disappointed murmur at the conclusion of my speech , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . Murmur more approving as the word went round that I had achieved tears . Buddy saluted me . Maeve put out a hand like a ghost feeling . I sat down . " Maybe you 'll come talk to me now ? " Dr. Jannie said . The children called him that ; sometimes she did . She talked about him more after I 'd seen him ; that was natural . Still , there are these people you never expect to have to deal with personally . Even if you know their sadness perfectly , maybe even seeing their story , seeing around it , just a little different from the person telling you it . Even so  --  he had been only a character in my friend 's life . But just now , I had had my first real death . And I noticed something about it that people never tell you . Not even the poets , who are supposed to have the high sign on it . From now on , Jasmin was going to be only a character in living peoples lives . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us . Oh , we could tell each other stories . About what had happened between her and us . We could explore it forever . Butp127nothing could ever change for her . On her own . She had no more chance . " M-maybe I will . " I did n't know whether I could bear to help the process along . But that was for later . I knew what had happened to me , too . I looked down the table . Oh yes oh yes , I was pretty young for what had happened to me ; for a long while yet , it might n't show . But I had joined the animals . A voice was telling me so . A character in my life . " Kangaroo , " it said to me . Kangeroo-oo . Maeve was looking down the long , buzzing table , at Jannie and me . No , at him . At least lift a glass to me , Maeve , throw me a kiss , even a department-store kiss . After all , it 's my twenty-first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched . At the time of the toast , I was elsewhere in time . Only a few minutes ago . But I remembered a time for Maeve and me when she could n't take her eyes off me . From about my eighth to eleventh year , it was the worst . Or when I got conscious of it . I 'd raise my eyes from my oatmeal or math book ; or even while I was talking ; I 'd bump into hers . " Stop looking at me . " She 'd shake her head , shake her glance away , and only smile . Ten minutes later , I 'd catch her back at it . " I love the shape of your head , that 's all , " she said once . " I just like to look at it . " And reached out and smoothed my hair . When I got too tall for her to do that without stretching , she stopped . About the time of Paulina , my first girl , of course . But I couldn'tp128buy that , much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Maeve felt vibes from Jasmin . It was the other way round . Jasmin was making me feel Maeve 's . Of all the girls since Paulina , all those who hung in my mind like upside-down pretty torsos not bloody at all , white as candy , tan as sand , all swaying in the wind like a gentle town on wasyday that I whizz by on my motorbike Jasmin is now the one who 's rightsideup , a speaking girl . She has a good head on her shoulders now . Thinskulled as it is , it can talk to me . She 's permanent . She 's telling me what I always knew , even at eight . That Maeve , next to Buddy , with him , was always one person , Maeve alone another . What I see now though , is something new . " That 's your mother , is n't it ? " Janacek says . " I'venot met her yet . That 's why I came . But I have n't managed to . You know she wo n't talk to any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Only that sometimes this means the person has a very bad thing inside , that dare not be said . " A child 's vocabulary . But it ticks . Maeve is sitting beside Buddy ; they 're together . But Maeve is now Maeve alone . That 's the difference . Is that so bad it ca n't be said ? I see now that she 's not looking at either of us . Not at the doctor , not at me . There are still vibrationsbetween her and me , from a lifetime together , but she'sunaware I 'm catching them . That is another difference . What if she 's not keeping things anymore ? Objects.  |p129Peo|ple  . Not keeping them even to change them , to throw them out for something else . Not even keeping the coats  --  to be kept . And if she 's not keeping Buddy , the vibes tell me , is it a matter of divorce ? You do n't divorce a child , a son . An only son and child . And my majority has nothing to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has nothing to do with sonsand-mothersjazz , or any of the psycho-dramas wellmeaningpeople are told of . She 's not keeping me on  --  that 's clear . Clear from the moment I entered the house , if I 'd looked at it . Sure it hurts . But is that the worst ? " But she did invite you here , " I said to Janacek . " I doubt she even knows my name . Your father did . He invited us all . " " He did . How do you know ? " He talks to me now and then you know . " " I see . " Standard for what people say when they do n't , Betts . An adult phrase . Hilarity even came over me again ; maybe that 's what chance is . Remember Tufts , our programming instructor , came to the school twice a week from down in Dutchess County , where lives the IBM God he was always going to take us on a day-trip to see ; but did never ? How he used to tweak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who were serious  --  usually you and me just when we had our heads bent , going at it hardest , how that jarringp130tug would come , in an arc that made us see stars . Treats us like reform-school boys , I said to you ; what if he is such a good man at his stuff ? You said no , studying was like a surface-tension you could get glued in ; he wanted us to kick past . He ruined a set-up for me once though . But when he came to you , you 'd already put everything to bed lightning fast and were ready for him . He bent down sideways , like a great wheedling moon , and said , " Right , Betts . You can tug my ear . " Though you were our best , we marveled . " How you handled him ! " we all said . " Sweet drunk , like my father , I know what to expect . " You said to me later . Oh , you were our best . Not why I chose you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I visited you in India ? Just four months ago , in the small house that fitted you too well . With its over-large nameplate . Never knew your middle name was Maitland . Fits you fine . I had never visited such a house before . You could tell me nothing , of all I knew you knew . Somehow I had to make you talk to me of those feverish schooldays  --  thelab hours after which you and I crept back to work and came out dazzled , walking across the yard in a silent double-migraine , to slide just in time into our seats in mess-hall , to chomp cold broccoli , cornbeef and ice cream  --  while the universalchessmen marched in our heads . With Tufts ' astral voice still barking at us what we called " Tufts ' Lord 's prayer . " Reorganize the problem ; define it.  |p131Determine  the method ; mechanize the method . Break down the chart . Remember human error . Debug . The flow-diagram is the flow of logic . Code from the diagram . Test . . . Getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a teaching man ; how we respected him for that ! . . . But about that day at dinner  --  standing near you in the heavy Indian sun , I reminded you of it , and of what you had done . We were a school that said grace before a meal and gave thanks again after , very Protestant , each boy taking his turn ; that day it was yours . You 'd always laughed at me for loving the computer terminology for its old associations ; the " assertion box "  --  by using which , Tufts said , a processor could assert his own individuality ; the " memory box "  --  where the installationstores . These terms were chosen like the Oedipus complex they talked about in psych class , you said . " Just a throwback to a former world . " And I said , " I 'm a throwback . " But that day , when you stood up to say grace , you winked at me . Enable all traps ! you barked , and the hall roared . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were snuffling expectantly through their winter-wet noses . Real computer language was what you loved , those agreed-upon alphabets that could n't be profaned  --  the very name ALGOL could wake your smile . You stood up , fiddled stagily with the remains on your plate , wrinkled your high Northumberland nose . All drunks have drama inp132them , you once said . Remember human error , you said , and walked out . When the headmaster called you in afterwards , you were lectured not on your manners to God , but on the difficulty of keeping publicly insulted cooks . " So much for the application of knowledge , Bunty , " you said . So when you turned eighteen , Tufts got you a research job at IBM . I visited you there too , the last time I saw you , except one . You had your own installation , or the squire 's share of it . " Still call it Batface ? " I said , but got no answer ; you were over my head now . And maybe IBM 's . They had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were twenty , not in college , and war-vulnerable . On a nearby memo pad , somebody had written : Define Macro Skeleton . " What 's MACRO ? " I said . " I forget ? " I saw you were dashed . " A form of pseudo-instruction . " But it came back to me like a long ride on the motorbike , after months of nothing between the knees but women . " Or vice versa , " you said . By after dinner , we had each covered our respective miles . On your desk there was a book called CalculatingEngines . " Charles Babbidge , born 1792 . Anticipatedeverything . Including IBM 's new 7090 . " I asked what that was . " This . " You laid a hand on it , like a man does on the throbbing that owns him . " Batface . " Then looked at me darkly , lively fairhaired Anglo as you still were , silver under night 's study/lamp . " Do n't you fall for any of Norbert Wiener 's leftover boys , Bunty pal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All the future 's already in the past , see . And ready for us . All of it . " I reminded you I was n't at Harvard , but merely at a nearby institution , where I had taken pains to see that my most complicated course was one on Whitehead and Russell . " In words , John . That old terminology . I 've wonked out on the other . It 's too applicable , just now . And MIT is dirty well applying it . " I was eighteen now , and my draft number was low . We discussed ways of not going . " Ways of not applying ourselves , " you said . " You 'll go on playing it by ear , Bronstein , I know you . " You were going out to New Delhi . For a subsidiary of IBM . " Where the needs are still very binary , " you said , with your old smile . This I remembered . " Tuft 's law . " It was Tuft 's contention that since computers talk in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the decimal  --  and since man , from feet to hands all the way to the on-off nerve systems of the brain was himself such a collection of twosomes , that the computerwas therefore as human as any of his creations to date . Sometimes Tufts would use " binary " and human interchangeably ; one Christmas he gave us a discourse on " binary " love.  | " Where 's he now ? " I had n't known he was dead . Of the error of drink . The Lord is dead , I thought , but I can smell his disciple , in the early Fishkill morn . On my way out , you made me a present of Babbidge . I have to say I never read him fully ; backpacking is hard on the mind . But when I found you in New Delhi , not at the address on your card , but no trouble at all , I remembered what you 'd said of him as I left . " The government gave him seventeenthousandpounds to build his Analytical Engine . He could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal to the job . He once said he 'd swap the rest of his life for three days , five-hundred years later . And look . " You jerked a finger at Batface . " Less than a hundred and fifty years , Bunt . Is n't that sad ? " I thought of that when I saw you again . John Maitland Betts , you were right . All your future was in the past . You knew what to expect . I seem to be collecting sadnesses . A backpack is more expansible than I thought . Do n't mention skeletons to me , Betts , for a while . But that day , looking down at you in your house-grave , I thought I could define yours . There 's a country beetle that winds its horn out there around four o'clock , maybe to remind one to listen to the heat 's silences and be warned ; you did n't seem to hear . Your head will never again be your house.  |p135I  trust you to hear me now . The mechanical means now provided being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each to each , in an input-output of two by two . Help me recognize the problem . I 'll determine the method . Ignore all traps or interruptions due to time , distance and graves . In the termination of Batfaces anywhere , we shall disable them . Hear old Tufts ' voice , homing like a fouro'clockbeetle in the after-hours of prep-school America . " But , disciples , the computer remembers any disabled traps . And when they are finally enabled , as we say it , they take place in a built-in sequence . Oh beautiful , gentlemen . Socko beautiful . " Then came the swig from the vest-pocket flask , brought out with a stiff one-two-three flexion : fingers , elbow , mouth  --  a ritual that he honored for a priestly moment afterward , eyes closed . Then went on talking , as if it had all been done in the dark . " And disciples , the building of systems which are to operate in real environments  --  with people ! With other machines ! With nature !  --  that 's the real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our manual , later . But it remained as he said , beautiful . Enable all traps . Let the dining hall laugh . You and I could never get over the thrill of it . Of that sluice-gate moment when all the interruptions are cancelled , and the sequence pays off , pays and pays . How we squawked of itp136to each other , from bicycle to bicycle , under the Babbidge-light the stars were already sending us from their past , while we rode through people , machines and nature  --  all waiting to be hemmed in . I thought I 'd found a religion . At fifteen . You 'd found Tufts . I got over it . Because all computers have to be lied to , Betts . At times . The data has to fit the problem . No moralityinvolved . Old Batface will do exactly what you tell it to  --  right or wrong . As all the manuals assure us , it is the perfect fool . But it ca n't lie , like a man does . To itself . Recognize the problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You two would make a good audience . Best information processors a boy ever had . The internal world of the 7090 , deals in microseconds ; would n't any life be quickly dealt with ? But you could handle it alone , Betts , even from the India of your little house . This particular installation  --  on whose magnetictapes we could record all the data a twentyone-year-oldlife can muster  --  belongs to my father . That wo n't matter . It does n't know . Pick up your past , Bronstein . According to leadingauthorities , it has your future in it . Process the question . Start with any one of them.  |p137Why  did Buddy lie ? Has he before ? .... Put that in too .... And to whom . EOF END OF FILE . " I see , " he said . He saw Maeve was going to leave them again .

And those minianimalsthat grin and glee down at the bottoms of Italian painting before perspective , heavy-headed little ghouls on pin-legs ? Does Buddy know how much Europe has taught me ? I ca n't see him as a monk , but I can in a Dutch burgher 's hat , wide with finance . And in a ruff , the family one , stiff with grandfather-starch and lacy hints from the family women . Holding him up .

Since 1575 , Dr. Jannie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talks to you  --  even if neither of you knows . When my father goes heavy and quiet like that , reddening like a solemn baby holding its breath against the bitter world , he never does anything physical . He 's not even touching Maeve 's hand . There was never anything to be scared of . She 's going to get up . Nevertheless . I never saw my father before . Those lines of force . Only  --  the door got there first . Opening with a rumblefrom the wheelchair behind . By now , every door in the house would have my grandmother 's gouge in it . And every person she met . Maybe she had humor once ; certainly there was sharpness ; it 's all gone to ill-will . Of the kind people our age simply do n't have . I do n't mean to exalt us . It 's only that in our own minds , we 're still saving people , not discarding them . No matter what we do , we still have general connections , not specific ones . Not narrowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next ones on  --  I 've felt it already . I do n't mind it being called innocence . I wish it could be kept . Sometimes , I almost think it can be . If I could teach memory not to chafe in one rut for so long that it finally has to justify that rut . I can try . " Why , the woman 's got an old AWVS uniform on . " The lady on my right  --  Mrs. Camel . Mrs. Drexel Jackson , has she 'd informed me . Now that I myself had joined the animals , I no longer saw her the other way . " Mrs. Reeves , you mean ? What uniform ? "  | " American Women 's Voluntary Services , World War Two . That marvelous old blue . " Poor Reeves , hoping that when friends meet her along the Avenue , they 'll think she 's some kind of volunteer . But she need n't have ; by now she 's got that limp look of people whose story you pass by , you have n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's what her story is . At school , much as I hated to pass by people like that , I did . It 's catching , otherwise . Reeves brought the chair to a smart stop , waving her other hand meanwhile . She had our notice . Mother MacNeil helps her out there . " Up on the balcony ! Mother talked ! " My grandmother had n't budged from what she was when I first saw her . Every morning , in Amenia , she combed her hair at the kitchen mirror with a liquid that kept it dark , yet scorned to do it secretly . Her hands had n't spread with work , but gone pinched . In Leinster once , where her quarter of us had come from , on the border between Englishtown and Irishtown I met a postmistressreminded me of her . Would n't deign to read your mail , but begrudged you it . A Kilkenny cat . Jonathan Swift went to school there . And learned something . None of us three family was eager to inquire what she 'd said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be so strictly her own . But Dr. Jannie leaned forward eagerly . " What did she say ? "  | " It was when Bunty answered his father 's toast . " Reeves flushed , for the Yiddish maybe . If it was . It was part of the gibberish the party-boy says at one point to his father ; I could n't repeat it if I tried . I had faked it . It was from where he seems to be saying " A son . A son . A son is given . " Or a man . ... A son is given ' is from the Messiah , I know that . We sang it in the glee club at the academy . And My son , my son '  --  that 's David to Absalom . When he finds him hanging .. . But that 's what I thought I said . " She 'd just been praying , as usual . She 's saying the Hail Mary , I think , if you listen close ; I 'm not too familiar with it . Anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary full of Grace . Either that , or else my name . " Reeves gave an odd smile . " Sometimes I think she confuses the two of us . Anyway , she slammed the door of her prayer-thing shut  --  she 's got a lot of strength  --  and said right out , " Hear that ? They 've got him . Get me downstairs . " Straight out . I had to bring her the back way  --  where the ramp is . But now she 's clammed up again . " What is your name ? " Reeves eyes got bluer . Not only the uniform . Contactis hard to resist , even if manners tell you to . " Mary Grace . " Mother MacNeil was struggling jealously . Her mouth ran about like a mouse she could n't catch . Jannie gave her his full attention at once . " Yes yes , yes yes yes . " His hand smoothed hers , buttering it withp141a new , light voice that came oddly out of his bear bulk . Yes , a dancing bear that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor a handsome robot , yet his flat face , deep-slit eyes , and that long , plumb line from nose to upper lip , did make me think of toy-types like the Tin Woodsman or Pinocchio , some creature that had been created from behind , more plainly so than the rest of us . Not a ghoul , Jasmin had said , explaining why she had gone back to him  --  and why she left again . Only the ghoul 's son . " With a mother like his , whom could one go to  --  to be a child ? " She had n't wanted to tell me his story . " It puts him in your power , Bunt , anybody who hears . " But I must have had her in my power without knowing it . After she told me , she lay very still . Since we spent most of our time together in bed , I have few memories of her any other way . He has all those . " Yes , yes  --  try . " He held my grandmother offside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't it marvelous , there 's nothing like it in the world . " He breathed deep . " She is hunting necessity . " He bent his head to hers . " Go on , go , " he said . He was weeping joy , or sweating bright balm . It 's his necessity , flashed over me . He wants her to do it for him . To show him the lengths to which people can go . Nobody in the room could crack the text she 'd quoted , though the donkey far down the table quoted a few wavering lines of what he said was the TwentyfourthPsalm . " Get a Bible . " Leskel glanced at his watch.  |p142All  down the room , the guests murmured like people leaving a theatre . They were leaving us with our troubles . It was only polite . I understand Buddy did go for a Bible . . . You ca n't do that , Batface , great as you are . Unless somebody in the office has already fed you all of it  --  which I doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-one : " You can not drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of devils ; you can not partake of the Lord 's table and the table of devils . " Meant for us human binaries , Batface . Not for you , who can partake of anything . I had n't stayed to hear . I had come to my senses at last and run after Maeve . Why was n't she keeping us on anymore ? Buddy ? Me ? The answer came to me in great spills of magnetic tape spiraling up through the house as I ran between its curling fountains , sidling at me anaconda from every corner . The machine of the past had vomited it . I found her where I knew I would  --  at the terrarium door . She was standing with her back to me , pressed forward , her spread arms cradling the curved wall on either side , like a tiny Atlas holding the bubble of the world . Or an experimenter , about to step into space holding onto a glass-and-wrought-iron balloon.  |p143The  sneakers I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her shoulders told me she heard it . But in whatever yoga-plan she was breathing by , I had no place . I must have lost my place there long ago . For months on end , I had forgotten her myself . To me this was natural . Was it to her ? As I came nearer , she let go of the globe and wheeled to face me , arms at her side . Just before I got to her , moving slower because I was scared  --  she had her feet on solid floor , but I felt her teetering , as if she were going to jump somewhere  --  she reached behind her , slid open the terrarium door to an arc just wide enough to backstep into it , still facing me . Smiling humbly , deferent , she barred my way . I let out my breath . In relief . I think the flesh ofapartment dwellers never really forgets at what heightit lives . Or not the child who is bred to it , warned whennear windows , or grabbed away from them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or soft stonebalustrade or glass , or nothing but nothing  --  between him and the people moving urgently down below . Downthere is the empire . The eye is always making the magic , forbidden leap . In old dreams , I floated down plumb , my descent safe in the marble column of itself , to aslow melody . Heard at windowsills , when leaning awake . A tension , like silent decibels . One grew accustomed to it . A slight fear of heights . Like a slight fear of death . I had never had it for her or Buddy , of course . They had had it for me . Now the balance had changed.  |p144But  she was in the safest place here . Heavy glass , aluminum banded at good close intervals . No access to the parapets  --  the only outside room that had n't it . A small core of safety . Aluminum is such a joyously weightlessmetal , a cheap sunbeam in rain . I fell in love with modernity all over again , just looking at it . " What a great idea , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go except back to me where I am , feet planted on the same parquet pattern that has followed us through all the apartment houses . She 's standing just back of the glass wall that curves toward her from either side . The floor inside there must be some three inches higher , bringing her that much nearer my eye-level ; when I first passed her height , years ago , I used to waggle a forefinger at her , senior to child . Above her head , a dark fester of vines and leaf-faces pressed toward me through the glass . " Even the door 's curved , is n't it ? That Claes is clever . Boy , what it must have cost . " Brushing against her wrist as I put my palm against the doorframe , I find her arm rigid . She really means to keep me out . Of her lair ? I can understand that . " Oh , it cost . " No grin . In department-store days , there would have been . " Maeve . What 's between you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , I mean . " " Nothing new . " " Something I should have known ? And do n't ? " Ip145try to grin at her . " Or should n't have . The bathroom wall . Remember ? " She does look up , then . " Remember ? The end of an era . " The day I  --  " What had I done , really . " You scared us . Me . " " How ? " " After that , I really did things Buddy 's way . Before that , it was sometimes for myself . " " Your parties , you mean . Changing apartments . Your not going downtown . " " That the way you saw us ? Only those three things ? " I shook my head like a swimmer . Second string . " Maybe it was me . The way I saw me . Between the two of you . " She shrugged . " People act on one another . A family . One day or another does n't make the difference . Do n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You have n't yet said . " When she does n't answer , I say " Maeve . Let mein , huh . " I try to laugh it off . " Let me see your lair . " She looks up quick . Says nothing . " After all , I am going to be an architect . " She put a palm up to my cheek . " Build well .. . No , stay where you are . I 'll talk . " " Aw , come on . " I become her child again . " We could sit on that bench in there . " On the far side of the terrarium , one of those iron cemetery benches had been poised , near what must bep146the new plants . Thin airy ones , spreading their lace ; they could n't weigh that much . At each point in the wall where there was a metal stave , Claes had bracketed it with a speared oval teardrop frame in filigree , in the center of each of which there was a piece of milky glass  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two , an old streaked mirror ; he had copied what the eighteenth century called a repose . It did make me feel a child again . In front of a secret garden . Out of those fairybooks I 'd hated , but wanted to believe in . " No . No . " She 's not lucid here . At this point , it stops . Here at this door . And here is where I 'm no longer a child . " Okay . Give . " " You make me feel so good . So normal . Just to hear your slang . " " A convenience . That 's what I am . You 're brownnosingme . " But I could n't make her smile . I touched her hair . " Since when Kwan Yin . " " Since . " Depression became her ; she looked younger for it . But it sat on her cheeks like rouge on a corpse 's . On the one corpse I 'd seen . " You look like him . Like Granpa MacNeil . I never saw it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She reached up to touch the spot between my eyebrows , where the Hindus put a red dot . Or the ash goes , on Ash Wednesday . " I used to be afraid your chin would turn out like hers . Like a cat's. "  | " Maybe it will yet . My mother 'll never make a Park Avenue wheelchair lady , though , no matter what Buddy does . People should lead their lives to their natural outcome . She 's doing it . I do n't mind her anymore . Not like Buddy hoped . " " But you left , just now , when she  --  " " No , I did it for myself . I 'm doing that now . Learningit . " " For yourself , Maeve ? " " I can only do it here . " The globe was like a rival . Into which she would recede . " You 're a quick learner . " Joke . But she shrank . I do n't have to imitate Buddy . I already sound like him . She made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to delay her . That 's all the vibes said . " How 'd you come to build this thing ? " " I came here for the city , you know . When I was young . " " Well ? " " I wanted to look at the city again . " " Again ? " " Like from the Amenia porch . " She had never said anything like that to me . In my whole life . Like that sounded . " And can you ? " I wanted to know too . It would be something I could hold onto . She looked down , hunted . It was the simplicity that scared me . " Oh , Bunt . I see so much . "  |p148Husky-voiced  . A woman I 'd never seen before . A woman . Making me see how in all the girl-wrestling I 'd maybe never seen any of them  --  right . How they chain themselves to each other  --  after we chain them . Be careful , Jasmin was saying to me . Your mother 's voice has death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Strange , how I can talk to you , " Maeve said . " Why is that ? " I could n't tell her yet ; it would choke me . Kangaroo . " You should n't have come back , " my mother said . " Why not ? " " I do n't want to talk . " " Maybe I do . " I took her by the wrists . Doing any of this was n't going to make me feel any bigger . But this was the audience I had . " Tell me , Maeve  --  has Buddy always given the parties around here ? " She went limp . Only a little . I 'd only slapped her gently , with her life . I let her go . " You should n't have come back . " " You 're telling me I 'm not worth anything . That 's not nice . " I could smile at that whimsy from a world where the rainbows were n't barbed wire yet . She looked ravaged enough to be my mother . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from you both . Without having to be away . " " How do you mean , Bunty ? " " I learned a lot over there , sure . But not what Buddythought . Not in the galleries only . Walking the streets , watching Europe . And in the bars , with my friends . " When we talked , no matter about millions of things ,  |p149no  matter what , underneath it was always about them back here  --  and us . Versus us . They were in possession of our childhoods . From a hundred thousand miles away  --  three times round the globe and over , they held us fast . " It was in Paris I learned it most . In the restaurants . Watching the kids and the parents  --  once I ate a whole dinner watching a couple with a two-year-old . Her grandparentsowned the place , but she sat up and ate like a little granny anyway  --  she knew she was watched . Oh there was love going around ; when the grandpa served me the melted butter I thought he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And the grandma came out of the kitchen like under a spell . But they were all so cool about it , the baby most of all . " I could n't believe it , whatever it was . " And when dinner was over , a little white dog jumped out from beneath the cloth . From the baby 's lap . And in their own family restaurant . " It knew , too , whatever was being taught there in front of my eyes . It was the coolest of all . " In Asia , too , " I said . " Though there it was too much . When they were poor . The parents were teaching them how to be . How to be the underdog . I wo n't buy that . " I 'd interested her . Fishing for her , skeining . Somebodyhad to . And could do it only with the truth . She 'd spread her arms against the curve of her lair  --  but she was listening . " What do you mean  --  I was telling you you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other things wrong over there . Butp150I could feel it in the streets . In the parks especially . Maybe it 's wrong . Maybe it only leads to armies in another way . But I wanted it . " " What ? " Maeve said . " What did you want ? " They 'd never really asked that , she and Buddy . Only thought they had . " A girl said it to me . She was going back to Boston to teach in a nursery , because of it , she said . She was going to try to teach them it . Monica , her name was . " She was still coming down , when she said it to me . I 'd held onto her while she screamed and huddled . Sex helped . I was sick on my own , though I had n't had a thing . Tired of my world-dwarfing , I huddled too . " She said it was too late for you to teach us obligation , " I said . " She said you only taught us love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 're smart . " " Let 's make it a rule , " I said . " Not to say that to each other . Ever again . A family rule . " Maeve looked up at me . " Too late for that . Your girl was right . . . Bunty dear . Go away and leave me for a bit , then . " " Leave you ? " She stretched out her hands. - " Be . " How seductive her voice was  --  and not for me . I knew how hard I had to fish for her . What I could n't figure was how . There was some secret to the terrarium . A bloody secret garden  --  somewhere . Holding onto her hands , not wanting to let them go or was she holding me ?  --  treading water for a time ,  |p151I  cast my eyes here , there . " School starts you becoming a person , Maeve , that 's all . " Her apologetic , blue-eyed boy , swinging arms with her . " I became one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You stayed where you were . In my mind . " I leaned closer , close . " Tell me , then . About Buddy . It ca n't be so terrible . " " Only to me . And it 's no secret . " " Only to me , Maeve . " " What good is it , if I tell you how Buddy lies to himself ? I ca n't tell you mine . " She gave me her strange , transparent smile , as if I must be seeing through her lips to them . " He digs being rich , you mean . " " For me , " she said , with the smile . " Only for me . " And she looked away from me , at the terrarium . What 's there , what 's there ? The jewels had been . That she does n't wear . The Kwan Yin that he began looking at art with . And when he knew better , discarded , leaving it with Maeve . The suit of armor , if we still had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pair of sunglasses on it . It 's all here , what she came to the city for . Why weigh it on him ? " Generosity can be a disease . " Maeve turned up my palms , staring at them . " That doctor tells Buddy it 's a way of possessing people . Buddy told me . " Jannie should know . I saw him in the launderette . With Jasmin 's check in hand . Holding his face out to her , like a check . " And what did Buddy say ? "  | " He laughed , and said Jannie 's not a Jew . ' Your father 's just as sick as they say I am . Only he 's a success at it . " She raised her chin high . I saw her mother in it . I saw her natural outcome . Or thought I did . And could love her for it . In a way she never taught me to . " Oh , Maeve . " I held my arms out , to her shabbiness . I hugged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more demands in them . What did it matter whether those demands were hers or Buddy 's  --  she had no more of them . I felt it in her  --  the emptiness of those who demand nothing from others anymore . Or not from themselves . Or who tell you the stories that help them dwarf the world . I let her go . Watching carefully . Standing near . Somewhere  --  there was a brink . " I 've a confession to make . I gave one of your coats to a girl . " If she asked which coat , it meant that she could still be dragged back . " Did you . I hope she needed it . " " She reminded me of you a little . " I suppose Jannie would say that 's why I get the girls I get . But it was n't merely the way the two of them felt to my arms  --  smallboned , downbeat . It was when Dina spoke of Felipe . Oh , I believed in her tale of the sphincter muscle . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be different . Why would n't he come here ? What if she ripped off houses like this because shep153wanted to ? Why would he rather mug ? What did they hang onto each other for ? What was their joint sadness ? " Did she . She live near ? " She said it absently , the way she had asked about schoolmates when I interrupted her , peering down meanwhile at a task . A glass globe , decorated and almost finished now ? Why did I think that ? What did it lack ? " In the park . " I said . Absently . " The park . " Maeve stared through her glass lair and out the other side . " I 'd like to live there . " " Maeve . Maeve . " I 'd been with as many way-out people as anybody . I could n't take it in her . " Maeve  --  let 's go get some gormay . " " Gour-may , it is , " my mother said . Half-laugh , halfsob . " I found out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her wild , whirl-on-a-heel intentness when she wanted something . She would get it too , like always . Unless I got there ahead of her . I followed her stare . " Your plants  --  your new plants . They do n't seem to be doing very well . Even though Claes watered them . " " Oh , they 'll do , " she said . Staring at them as if they were shelves . With her death on them . They 'll say now that she was telling me . Asking me for help . Directing me toward it . But I do n't believe it . She had it all worked out . She had n't asked me to come back . And had taken all precautions . The key was at her waist . She was only gambling on when.  |p154You  guess things because of what you are . In Maine once , I knew a local boy who could n't tell his left from his right  --  and walked more unerring in the woods because of it . My habit is maybe a city one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a cock of the head , a stretching of ears  --  anything handy . I follow architecturewith my body . Skyscrapers do n't do anything for me ; I just stand tall . The Taj Mahal made me spread my fingers  --  Siva Siva . And certain parts of Italy put me in knots . Or tempted me to fly . Jasmin was onto it . " Think of me as Borromini Tower , " she said once . And leaned back . " Buddy bought the farm , " my mother said . " Our farm . Watch out . He thinks he did it for you . " Funny how just as I began to catch onto what the lair was  --  to mime its space to myself , plotting it mentally with my feet , getting the feel of it in my arms , receiving its message like a cable I could n't read yet  --  my mother began to tell me what she thought was the story of her life . Just as I was only half-listening ; maybe she felt that . We talk best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was observing the plants . Dark-snouted , the nearer ones , healthy velvet , clambering toward us , opening their broad throats . Screaming . If I could only tune in . " Do n't take a house from him , " Maeve said . " You 'll never get it right for him . Or if you do , you 'll only be its secretary : Secretary to the house . And he 'll move on . He 'll be doing it down at the office . While everybody'sp155watching the house . He 's too smart for us . That 's one time he tells the truth . The plants in the rear  --  high , graceful aureoles new from the greenhouse  --  were already only a faded lace , scarcely breathing , their broad skirts drooping , as if a squeezing hand was at their roots . At the Folies Bergere , I 'd seen a mock ballet of Circe  --  twining green sirens , oldish women most of them , kicking and cavorting in and out of painted cloth waves , from behind each of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done in black light . The plants back there looked as if they too were in stage-light , on another plane . The cemetery bench was pushed near them . And close to it  --  the Kwan Yin was back . Inside . " Buddy 's afraid to be rich . He has to have somebody to lay it on . But the peacock has to stand very still . Take his money , if you have to . I earned it . But get away somewhere . To that Paris , if it pleases you . " " You ca n't earn it for me , " I said . " Not going to war taught us that . " I tucked my elbows tight against my ribs . Architecturally , the terrarium was speaking to me . But a real terrarium is for plants , I thought . All moisture , no air . Or not much . It 's not for the animal kingdom . Even a peacock would n't want in . Not for long . " He wanted to give me the farm . He planned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could stand on the porch there . And look at my life . But he would n't be there standing with me . Equal . He wo n't do it with you either . Even poor old Blum agrees with that . "  | ... But I 'm young . And I 'm the son ... True , Bud had n't mentioned taking her up there . When he talks of her , he never gets her quite right  --  I saw that . But he could n't be the ogre she made of him either  --  I knew that . " What 's Blum got to do with it ? " " When I went down there , that once , to the opening , I made friends with her again . She was his girl for a long time once ; did you know ? " " Now that I think of it . " I had n't , much . The Kwan Yin I 'd mistaken for Maeve was in positionagain ; I could see its coif , bent . Anyone who sat on the bench would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bench  --  another head , too high for an occupantof the bench to pat easily . The Chinese lion glared at me resignedly ; porcelain never believes its own expression . But always knows its value . This one was a beauty . Like mismated companions , those two . She must have dragged them both back . " She still is , " Maeve said . " Now and then . Buddy 's a generous man . He does n't like to see the money go out of the family , but he 's generous . Every one of the girls he 's had since , has had a house built for her . When he moved on . " " Maeve . " It stood to reason . That a man would n't have just one . But within a family , it 's always a revelation . " Did you always know ? " " No , but should I mind , really ? I 'm the one he never left . Blum says he has n't anybody now . And my house , he 's grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she like it , did n't she . From her expression I could n't tell . " What about you ?  --  did you ever ? " " Once . But he lived in the suburbs . We could n't keep it up . " It was chilling , of course . To find out they had n't lived their lives for me . Still , I had been kept . For tonight . " Can I stand like you ? Like this ? " I sidled  --  and suddenly I was backed up against the globe , spreadeagledagainst it with my hand halfway from my sides , like hers . I made myself laugh at her . " Gives you a feeling you 're off the floor . " The sliding door was between us now . With a chink of light on the open side . My side . " If we 'd moved to the suburbs , it might have worked out . I might have got out . But he was n't a city man . Living in a Bronxville hotel . Temporarily . The Gramatan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw the notice of that , I  --  but of course we did n't move . " ... In the bathroom , way back . Could I have sensed it , somewhere between the elbows ? .. . " You were going to leave Buddy ? " " I needed time to . He was negotiating for a seed farm ; he wanted us to live on it . You see its name now in all the garden stores . " She said it dreamily . " Maybe I would have . But this way  --  we broke up . I felt guilty for a long time . " I did n't ask her which way . Maybe she saw my face . I would n't bank on it . " He was n't a city man , that was only why . Youp158must n't think that Buddy and I have n't anything in corn . . .  --  that we have n't had  --  it may be hard to see now . . . but once . " I knew what they had . You see it any age , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get out of it . In all actuarial probability I 'll inherit the tendency ; the margin of error otherwise is very small . She and Buddy have a hell of a lot in common , even without our long line of houses , the pile of stocks and bonds that must go with it , and me like a sick-and-sorry Cupid on top . Or the farm , that will go blindly , serenely from one owner to the next , with all its brambles and cows . She and Buddy  --  my parents the Bronsteins  --  they dug each other 's lies . They tell each other the same world-dwarfingstories . Call it love ; people do . " Buddy show you those peepholes ? " Maeve said . " When we came here , he showed me the one in the hall . Peek. ' he said . I did , and what-do-you-know , I saw my life . And the house I should build for it . " She bites her lip just like Buddy does . " You think badly of us ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at their suggestion when I was six . She looked me full in the face . Put her hands out to me , forsaking her wall . " What we gave you , I 'm sorry it was only love . " It was then I jumped . Into the terrarium . Lightly , as I knew I must . Dropping on all fours . That way I figured to equalize any shock . Of my weight . The stepp159up had been about three inches . I had cleared it . My weight after a summer of no swimming is one-seventy . Nothing trembled in this floating filigree in which I had landed . What had I expected ? Floor was floor under my knees and palms . Balsa . Good show , Claes . Yet my elbows hugged my sides , dreaming their stresses and strains . A border of earth , flower-box wide , circled the wall . No plants showed , but it had been heavily watered . There must be a run-off for seepage below . Where had the drains been in the hanging gardens of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savoring the precious stuff like a camel 's gut . There was provision for violet light here , and up from the floor near the door a separate switch box which I opened . A Murray Load Center , all trim and well-housed . That was wise . I closed it . Clinging to the doorframe , my mother leaned in at me , whispering like a gargoyle that dared not scream . As if even air counted here . When I moved , she moaned . I stood up slowly from the ankles , to a kneebend , keeping my center of gravity holy , like an acrobat . Only my body was smart . I still had n't guessed . Slowly I inched toward the grouping at the bench . " Do n't . Not any nearer . Bunt . " " Where is it , then . " I turned , slow-motion . A gascock , my stupid head was looking for . Or a small egg of metal , set to ignite . After all I 'd been brought upp160on explosions , rocket-flares , house timbers rising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With the people running ahead , clouds behind them , their faces stretched like hers . " Everywhere . " A puzzled whisper , more lucid than mine . " Is it in the plants ? " A nod . Hands wrung white . When I moved again , one covered her mouth . " Hold still . Wait . Please wait . " She covered her eyes . I felt behind me , in one of the pots . The plant , set in spongy florist 's stuff , had almost no roots . The rest of the pot , iron and about eighteen inches in diameter , was filled with stones , mixed with disks , machined , and regular . I palmed one , inching it out . An ordinary old-fashioned kitchen-scale iron weight , marked with a " 5 . " I did n't need to examine the other pots . All close in a ring , and all as large . My hand had spoken to my head . Finally . As a child , after all , it was only falling from windows that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sometimes , slow as blood-hum , the wall sinks away , and down . I turned my head . An oddly intimate grouping  --  a bench , a lion , and a statue . All with one thing in common . And now me . And I had it too . No odder than any fire-escape family . On a hot night . A short , intent man , say , and a thin , cool woman . The wicker stool the son always sat on . And the son ,  |p161of  course , the last to be added . They always settled themselvesbefore he was allowed there . To be alone there was forbidden , though he had done it . Mornings , when only the maid . Now it was night . And we three are gazing out , into the central park of our longings , that ends for some on Fifth Avenue , on the far side . But we are together still . We are each of us pulling our weight . Like now . " Maeve . . . look at me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . We were maybe four yards apart . Less . I held out my arms ... I had a right to know , I thought . But did I ? In the years to come , I 'll fathom it .. . " Come , Maeve . Join me ? Us . " She scraped her thighs with her nails . Agony issimple . A skull trampled into pavement . A woman luggingweights into her house . A man watching them . ... You 've guessed it , have n't you Batface .. . She stretched her arms toward mine . Keening isa throw-back sound . " I dare n't . Add my weight . " So we had trapped each other , she and I. " It was only for me , " she said . " Only for me . " " Is it to maximum ? " " Past . It must be . Days ago . Those plants .... Bunt ? How did you know to come ? " How had I ? " I had a loss . " I started to walk back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "  |p162If  I did , what would I hear ? " Let me call the fire department maybe . Or get a rope . " No sweat . I 'll bet it 's okay . " How violent her images were , of how to get through normal life . Machinery instead of muscle , that 's the real violence ; sanity is not involved . " You added the weight day by day , is that it ? " Hour by hour ? " Whenever I could . I look through the peephole . And then . " Her voice was so dry . It drew my respect . " Right . I 'd watch that earth-border after this , though . Against too much watering . " And seepage from rain . " Just get over here . Please . " But when I lifted a toe , she went white . " Can you jump ? " I thought of all the old architecture I knew . But I was adrift in their world now . Of reinforced concrete . " No sweat . " I smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " A sprint , and a little flying jump up and over onto the other floor-level , nothing for my long legs . And all the time , I was sure that the world would hold . " Okay , hon. Stand back from the door . " I took a look at the apartment from there . The huge Rothko glowed red , descending into orange , then to a nude band I could n't entirely see . I raised myself on toe , leaned forward.  |p163And  Doughty shot past her through the door . Slid to a braking stop on the glossy floor . Snapped at Lion , dismissed him with a sniff of recognition , and sauntered to earth . Nosed it , trotting this new globe full circle . On the far side , he stopped , looking at us . Dogs relate to posture . In us . Suddenly he sprang in the air , yipping at his own behind , galumphing round and round , up and down , with mock-snaps over his shoulder at us , fawning for the ball I must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the good animal who knows the difference between real wrong and the mischiefwe will love him for . At the far end he stopped short , growling . Faced us over his shoulder . Not a growl  --  I 'd never heard a dog make that sound . A cajoling whine . A cringing whimper . At the enemy he ca n't see . How much does a Great Dane weigh ? His puzzled , dowager face asked me it , while his back legs scrabbled a little , sensitive one second before I was , to the canting of the floor . Maybe earthquakes begin like that . Nothing savage at first , or open . No cracks you can see . An undertow . Your sense of perpendicular is even tickled . Like anythingimportant that happens , the feel is partly sexual . Like fear . Maeve screamed . My name . Or I 'd have stood there . Back of me , under , I felt the floor yawning away from my heel . I dug in the toes of my sneakers , sprinted up the incline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the dream is n't of down , but of up  --  grabbed for onep164of the aluminum struts that had buckled forward , swung there while the strut slowly bent  --  from the Mark of Zorro , Douglas Fairbanks flashed me , I swear it  --  and kneeing inward with all my strength I landed , sprawled . Maeve helped me up . I held her , slumped in my arms . Behind us we heard the crack . When Jannie and my father came up , the first to come running , I still held her , they say , lifted , her head and feet dangling , like some girl I had dragged in from the sea . I remember Jannie . He was ahead of Buddy , and his need shines always in his face . I approve of that . He 'd already run such a distance with that life-story of his behind him , a bundle that whether he walks or runs hits him regularly in the back . Anyway , I handed her to him . Right in his arms . While Buddy stood by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could n't help that . " People get lost , " I said . I hear Buddy wanted to go in after Doughty but was restrained . Poor Doughty 's nails did n't have much purchase on the balsa ; maybe that frightened him . He could have made it ; the terrarium had sagged to a point and then stopped . But he cowered at the border , hisp165four feet clamped in earth . A bright fireman got him , though not until the police were called too . After they 'd sent in the tear gas , the ladderman got Doughty  --  with a grappling hook , it looked like . Whatever they use on us . I saw the dog 's arched neck rear above the battlesmokelike a Delacroix horse ; two of the buckling metal staves crossed under it like bayonets . Gravel he was kickingup soared in high arcs and fell , slow as tracer bullets  --  from old movies . I could hear the dum-dum bullets , softnosed , exploding on impact  --  that people thought we had outlawed . And this was only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were already calling the demolition experts . I could have told them the terrariumwas n't going to fall any further , of itself . As proved the case . It was to hang there for two months while a wreckage crew with the will and means was sought for  --  the area-way was n't very large . And while the Fifth Avenue Association protested the crowds that came to view . They came like they still did , I heard , for that house the Weathermen blew up on West Eleventh Street . Maybe they took the day off and visited both . Our globe could have hung there like at Pisa , or at Venice , or Agra , where the ruined angles still hold for a long , long time . They could have let it hang there in its milky colors , like a warning from Fifth Avenue , to those fancy highrisers that watch us from the Palisades . We could have propped it up , and it couldp166have stayed there for people to brood on . In the mornin ' an ' the evenin ' , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An opal bad-luck piece . But I saw how the clear and present danger ennobledevery official face . We build for ruin here , we do n't save for it . And the flat would be sold . And I knew I did n't want to be an architect . When we begin to slouch off  --  my crowd , our age , call us what you want  --  it starts a long way back , in the way the bones handle , the clothes and the gait , the voice . A kind of pussy-footing , with insolence . For all our torn fates . Throwing it away , onka-bonka . Throwing it all away . Yet khaki is still so boss for us . Such a camouflage . I was wearing army surplus myself . When I left the wall I was leaning on , they never saw me go . I went into the armory-room , to get my head clear . Quiet place , leather-padded for history to be comfortablehere , old-blotter walls , air dim as a museum afternoon , in the wrong wing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Halberds and vizors , musketry on a wall . I never wanted to be a summer soldier . Or a winter one . Above Seventy-sixth Street , I heard a passenger plane whining toward nirvana . People are the bombs now . Hold your breath , the air 's bleeding as they pass through . All soldiers are the same now , in their sphinctersand in their khaki brains . And all lonely slouchers , walking sentry for the world . There 's no leaving it . I went to the nearest bathroom and vomited up the war.  |p167The  gourmet you can get at night in the downtown financial district is extraordinary . You can sit in the one glow-worm hash-house that keeps open for policemen and other derelicts , have a western omelet , and watch dawn creep up the spine and structure of the world . The financial one . And the moral one . At four AM , their minarets tend to combine at the top . Buddy wanted to sit at a table , but the guy at the grill said , " Counter service only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bunty said . " Seems to know you . " He glommed in the mirror at his own cruel face , on which the red beard was beginning to blush . " We have our own commissary . " " I 'll serve us , " Bunty said . " My pal 's beat . " He settled his father at a table , and brought back the food . Buddy had his head in his hands . That was normal here . They sat for a while , until Buddy could take a sip of coffee . When he had downed half a cup , his head came up . " Westerns are the best in these joints . " This reversal of roles gave Bunt no surface joy . But at the bottom of himself , an imp of Kilkenny screwed out a smile . " Come on , eat something . " His father ate . In the window , the view bloomed like a series of cathedrals walking toward them along the river 's edge . They were on a stretch of sludge lookingp168northeast up the harbor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two of the nearest towers were like marlinspikes , half-hitched to the sky . " Very good . " Buddy made no move to go . " Funny , how no matter what they build down here , it ends up looking maritime . " " All made-land , this part . " His father pushed at a crust on his plate . Two workmen rolled in , fresh-faced and far-eyed , as if they had come up out of the water itself . " Place must serve the crews on the Trade Center . They work early , sometimes all night . Port Authority dispensation . Or the Mayor . " This was the most his father had said since the police had made them leave the apartment . Gas seepage , they said , and maybe watersoaked cables . You folks better go to a hotel for the night , hah ? Money 's no problem here , the lieutenant 's left eye said to the patrolman he was leaving on guard . As he took Buddy 's donation . All smooth . Except that Buddy would n't go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yours , huh ? " " We can see this area . From my secretary 's office . " " Blum ? " Buddy nodded . The food had given him color . " She has a good view , huh . The best . " For a liar , his father had steady eyes . " The whole office has a good view , Bunty . " " Which way do you face ? " He could n't help it if he sounded like that actor talking to old Von Stroheim from the opposing battlement.  |p169Buddy  had his elbows on the table . " Everywhere . " He spoke from behind his fists . " We have the whole floor . " He shrugged . He took no joy in that now , the shrug said . But a newsboy from Brooklyn twitched one corner of his mouth . " One whole floor up there ? " Through the cafe 's other window they could see the building complex he recognized from slides , a dull safe-deposit gray , up against the Strozzi Palace of the Federal Reserve . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was scudding to a wind . Going to be one of those rough equinoctial days . " Maybe we do . You never came downtown to see . " One of these days that came anytime of the year , any country . The waves were whipping a little , past these buildings that were all of silver , no matter what the dawn was saying . " Maybe we should all go to live down there . Maybe we should of , long time back . " He felt sick . Glad . " You might get lost down there , friend . Your last letter was sent to two offices back . " Buddy put his palms on the table , to stop their tremor . He means what kind of a son am I , ca n't remember his father has an office at One Chase . Listen Buddy . What 's this all of a sudden you been holding the fort and I 'm the shirk ? You approved of me not going , all along the line . You all but connived . Or would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like Gramps did for Uncle Charlie in the last one  --  oh yeah , I heard.  |p170The  greaser was looking at them ; the place was filling up . " I go round the world , Buddy , the whole world , " he said . " And I do n't get lost . Only here . " He got up and went to the counter to pay . One of the two workmen who had come in first was joshing the other . " Pay for your coffee just because you 're my boss , ah c'm on . " He winked at the counterman . " Section boss he is , since yesterday . Nah c'm on , bigtime . " He paid . The money in his pocket sluiced through his fingers . He paid . Buddy was already at the door . Below his own eye level , his father 's shoulder was the same substantial bulwarkit had always been . He pressed a hand on it and opened the door . Going up the hill to the Chase , Buddy took his arm . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held his own arm stiff . Available without seeming to be . " Sure you do n't want to go to a hotel ? " No answer . Why are we going to the office ?  --  his father had said , still white about the gills , as they left the apartment , handing the keys to the guard  --  We are going to the office because that is where I feel safe . When they reached the Plaza , Buddy disengaged his arm . To one side of the patterned stone well in the center , a huge white plaster thingum , gaily striped in black , froggied its open spaces at them , galumphing on the gray air . " The new Dubuffet . Like it ? " Public games . Two of the early morning populace passed under it , mute and dogfaced.  | " Looks as if it 's kidding the place . " The town had opened its streets to these outcroppings , and closed its eyes . " Thingum-lingam , " that card Jasmin had said , passingone . " Rockefeller took a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civvy tongue . It scraped him . It violated old movies . He had no other right . Going up in the elevator , his ears clicked . The elevator brinked . After Europe 's , it had the self-assuranceof a plane . He stepped from it , eyes wide as a blind man 's . Buddy led him to a gilt-marked door . " Q. Bronstein , " Bunty said . On his own passport it was spelled out . " I like that . " " Get a lot of mileage out of that Q. " A lot , a lot . A little , a lot . A son , a son . His father 's linear reality walked before them , like a duck . " You did n't eat , did you . You can eat here . " Buddy held out a small key . " Blum had it made for me at Tiffany . " Gold . He had no interest in the inscription . " What do I do with it ? " " Open up . " Buddy was panting . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father passed under his arm , stumbling like a man comingup out of a submarine . Murmuring " Show you later , " he shucked coat and hat on a desk , went in the door marked Q.B. , and came out with a couple of pills in his palm , and a glass . " Seconal . Want one ? " " No thanks . " " C'm on then . " He downed a pill . " This stuff won'tp172take for a quarter-hour yet . I 'll hold off on the other one . Give you the short tour . " " Okay . " He saw Buddy was still trembling . The place was quiet as a dead beehive . All shades were at weekend half-mast . He had walked into a part of his childhood which he had forgotten  --  the Saturday half-day office  --  and knew at once he would miss forever , if he took no care . Limegreen quiet . Clerks here or not here , but all with lives folded like locust-wings behind them . Kept well back of what was needed here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ghosts , ready for Monday . The telephones sentient ; no real death here . Night coming on , with its uptown complications , but there 's a chance you could stay ; there 's a cot in the washroom . And a couch . He and his father had done it once ; he must have been about five . Brooklyn , and a death . They had come here to escape the hysterical drawstrings of the house . And to be where Buddy had to be in the morning . Even with his grandmother dead , he could feel his father lapped in that earthly satisfaction . The letters on the door then were his grandfather 's : A.B . " In Abraham 's bosom , " his father said , bringing him a play pad and pencils . " Yes , it 's good here . " He had already half-learned to read from the lettering on such pads , and ledgers and bill-forms . The office lingo exchanged above his head stuck there like the " hundreds and thousands " candies he always got here , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirt , before he got them down . There was a word in the washroom , not quite rubbed out , what was it ? " Givep173that Caliban of a cleaner his time and goodbye , " Abe had said . On the moved-out cot , waves of selling and buying rocked him to sleep as neatly as the painted crossstitchingon his home nursery towel . Above his head , on the darkish , diplomaed wall , the word , " Actuary " glimmered like a furl from Abe 's feather-pen , which stood on the desk in a bell of shot , and had come from a time called the sesquicentennial . And all night long , he woke to watch the desk , hopingthat the beautiful birds of chance might fly out of their pigeonholes . You never liked offices , Betts . You drank to get out of them and " into " life , as you said  --  and got jammed halfway . I think you never tasted an office young enough . To feel the blood-urge when the beehive is humming , and people are going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sane . And porky with eating that 's paid for . And sexed , with the sweet pinch of ass and swell of cockfight that underwrites all deals . You never felt the mysticism of those afterhoursdown here or the Sunday ones , which comesof having the power to support a church without ever entering it , because rich men pass through theeye of the needle every time the telephone rings , and afterwards there is always a little typist-perfumelingering in the world of big ideas . But you 'll haveto plug it in . Give old Batface its bit of barmecide . Funny , that until I pushed in that office doorp174after so long , I never thought of the place . Though it 's no secret to us that the man must confront the childhood . For the words in the washroom to burn up again in all their flaming colors , and the Calibans to crowd around us with their steamy brushes . And for the hundredfold innocences to roll again in the grundgey palm . I pushed in that door  --  and out flew all the beautiful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can speak to a father in his lair . We 'd made the tour I could see he thought was such a big one . If you could walk with me now on the periphery of this so-called office , you would be tracing a high , miniature counterpart of this island , and its escarpments , the size of watch parts from up here , connectingon and on . " Mainland ca n't be told from island any more , can it , " I said . " You sure can see that from here . " He liked that . I could see the world-dwarfing glitter in his eyes , as if you could cap an eye with gold , the way you can a tooth . People in the street know that mainland-island bit by now . I made my naked eye-lens zoom down there , so that in my mind I saw them as I wanted to  --  just as knowing in their shabbiness . He had his mainland , I mine . Inside the place here , there 's a real heartland ofp175rooms that provision for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside , on and on . I like best the kitchen commissary that supplies everybody , from the hall large enough to entertain a government , to the director 's boardroom , to the coffee shop where the collars wilt from white to blue . I could tell from the cookery smells that there were Helgas here . We peeped into the circular room that is a small stock exchange , where I could see how it would be on a business day  --  men crowded , beef-heads and lanternjaws , curly and bald , diplomaed and rough diamond , hook-nose and North Shore pug , all at the round tabletrough , while the lights jabbed on and off , on the big wall . It would be like a horse-auction I saw once in Brittany . You would never catch the flicker of the eye that says , " Buy ! " Or the death-loll of the tongue that says sell . Nearby , a door said Comparisons . Did n't ask what meant ; did n't want to ask him anything more for a long while . Besides , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will want to know how well they 've managed it . Money 's not so different from other constructions . Elbow-space . The pigeonhole pockets opening and shutting , while the brick builds in the bank vaults . And when all the plumbing 's in , government to government , state to state  --  and all the wires that you can teletype sugar and wheat and other futures on ; when you 've bonded people and their mutuals for the best tax shelters , how different is the lingo from Corinthians ? You 've got yourp176cathedral . With a little bit of Borromini at the top if you want it , to make a girl lean back . I 'd tell him that later . Someday . In my own way . You take much Seconal these days ?  --  I was about to ask him , when he one-upped me . He opened the door on you . Batface . I did n't know you at first . The thingum he calls " the Zebel thing " is in front . " Like it ? " he said . Computer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same performance . Still , for our needs  --  size gives confidence . Never thought we 'd get Zebel though . To dress it up . This is the front office , you know . You and I came in the back . " How you can have a front and back to a near-perfect circle , is Buddy 's lookout . I walked over to the great screen and flattened my palm on it . Not aluminum . Steel . Trying to look like a cosmic spider web , but only fifteenfoothigh and within the building code . Shining through the plate-glass entry , Zebel 's metal mesh winked at the populace through dozens of light-slots , each one hooded in the very shape of the Rockefeller eye . Spiders of the world , unite !  --  I thought . You can do better ; Art gets smaller all the time . But I liked Zebel ; he was a man with a joke . " Good as the Dubuffet anytime , Buddy , " I said . " Both of them understand Americans . " Zebel must 've known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No matter ; he did the right thing . You ca n't hide a computer with art.  |p177I  stepped behind the Zebel to the good , clean space where the computer is . You are your own description , Batface , in magnetic light . And thoughts that get larger , all the time . " Oh , God , " I said . " Oh God , god . " And a logo . " The Lord is my shepherd . " Here you are . " Had a course in them once , did n't you . " He was yearning with pleasure . I 'd admired something he had . He did n't even mind that I knelt . I was at Betts ' grave again . His silent , magneticgrave . Knowing better now why I 'd chosen his to visit , out of all those I could have touristed to . Vietnam , ifI 'd wanted to . People could do that all through the war , like vivandieres . But I could never see any percentagein visiting the dead . For either of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get to it  --  and a ramshackle limousinethat rattled like a paddy-wagon and then broke down , leaving me to walk two miles unhelmeted , as if this wasthe right way that transportation to a grave should end . Back here where no beetles were honing , Batfacetold me why I had done it . My father 's computer couldtell me that without being asked . Betts taught me whatTufts had taught him . From bicycle to bicycle , I learnedit , under the Babbidge-light the stars were sending usfrom the past , while we rode through people , machinesand nature  --  all waiting to be hemmed in . In the lab , sweating next to me over the holy buttons , he taughtme . The way Tufts taught him . With no words , andnever an embrace . That 's why I went to New Delhi.  |p178To  give him his percentage . He taught me obligation , Buddy . I thought it was love . " Yeah , Buddy , I had a course . Like to find out someday , how this one ticks . " I put my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , larger and meaner to feed , but still the same . " You would , huh . " Buddy put his glass of water down ; he had n't taken the second capsule yet . He was glowing with a look I knew of old , without recognizing until now where he got it from . Old Abe 's  --  when a wayward boy was found to be still a possibility . " Yeah . I thought I was over it . But I was lying to myself . " He stared absently at the capsule . When you 've taken a hundred of those , they 're like aspirin , like speed or anything . Or the wee , gummy pipe that Jasmin put me onto , once  --  a souvenir , brought to her with all the fixings , by a girl she 'd nursed with in Hongkong . I suppose that not getting as gone as she did for those four hours , put me into the terror I have of it . I ca n't stand to see anybody I like put themselves out . While I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and yours , go nihil-nihil down the windowpane . " Got something else to show you , Bunty , something else . You do n't mind ? " " Mind ? No , I do n't mind . " I minded his humbleness , though . Like his letter , theirs , it was n't to me , but to my youth  --  which made a nothing of me . And makes them angry in the end . Or depressed  | " Come on , then . " He led me away from here , down and around corridorsI planned to learn , to a door with no lettering . The whole place is like I imagine a brain to be , if you could live in it . Nothing in it too far from the rest . This particular door was unlocked . There was nothing to steal here , that 's why . Barring a few of those worn possessions which drop off a family as it jogs , never to be seen again , unless  --  like here  --  they 've been saved . Two morocco-leather couches whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tan under the black . A piano . Some pillows much too silly to have lasted . In the jointure of the couches , where the telephone used to be and still was , a crocky brass lamp . At the foot of one of them , a crumpled old throw . I walked over to finger it . Said to be camel 's hair once ; by now it must be human skin . Its mottle was what memory is . Old on the eyeballs . The piano still said Kranich Sc Bach . Tackety-tock . Abe used to play a piece called Sentimental You on it , when he visited us . And the Continental Foxtrot . " My corner , " I said . " At 101 . " " Abe 's old office in Brooklyn , first . Then mine . " Not just 1 o 1 for me either ; i o 1 was just the last . " I used to envy kids with houses  --  I did n't think you could save apartments . " Buddy laughed . " Saving is like spending , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly . " Abe 's office ? How 'd you come to bring it home ? "  | " I went bankrupt once and had no office . When you were just born . " I sat down on the other couch . Sentiment is any story you have n't been told . The more watery ones , usually . " Anything else I ought to know ? " " Why ? I look sick or something ? " He said it craftily , like they do . Wood-touching . Only his shoulders looked changed to me . Lost a little hope . " Just saving . Like you said . " He fingered the phone . " She had an abortion the following year . After that , only misses . So you 're the sole heir . " On the wall opposite me was one of my own brassrubbings , sent him the winter before . I was already hung on a wall , a family artifact . Creepy . It was a start . " What was she doing there , Bunt ? In that glass thing ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to college , too . " His ugly style . And Abe 's . " Fuck the psychology . " " In the dorm , we had two girls we were always breaking in on . " The men more often managed without signaling . Or with more success . Like yours , Betts . Or those are the friends I get . " I should never have let her build that fool place . " That last little bubble from the bottoms ? He could n't mean it . He could . " You could n't help it . You 're rich . "  | " That a putdown ? From the ranks ? " " Sure is . Learned it from you . " I walked over to the piano to calm myself . Picked out a tune . Onka-bonka . Going to the front . Outside , the world is fair . " She said you give the parties now . You give that one ? " " I have a secretary , is all . Easier for Blum to send the invites . And then , if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I mean , like Leskel . Hard to separate business from pleasure these days . In our business . " Then he did what they do , if we 're handy . " It was your party , after all . " " She says she could n't give the kind you wanted . " " So ? I never wanted the parties , kid . Those parties . I 'm a busy man . In a world she . . . Parties . " He spat into the air . It was a good tycoon imitation . That 's where the stress is , onka-bonka . When you imitate . " Not even in bed , she could n't . She said . " I saw the second capsule slip from his hand onto the Navajo rug Ike and I used to shoot immies on . " Tell you something , Buddy . Maybe it 's only because I 'm young . But I never yet paid for it . " What independence . Only one I have . " Wait . Just you wait . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , kid . Look at yourself . You take after her . I 'm the boy his mother had to tell him any boy does n't look like a monkey is okay . "  |p182That  's one way they get at you  --  humility . Do I preferpride ? " That lummox she had . A seed cataloguer . From Idaho . " " Does she know you know ? " " I never said . In our family the women never  --  " He shrugged . Put his head on his fists . " God , I have to sleep . " Never said , never went downtown , never did . I thought of the child I 'd had for minutes  --  Jasmin 's . I 'd have fed it all the music , from all the dixie cups . He was scrabbling on the carpet for the capsule . On the pattern I knew by heart , I saw it , in the cranny where the smallest agates used to lodge . He was watching me . " What do you think of us , Quentin ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mind inheriting it . " My lips went stiff . " It 'll come on me , and I wo n't know how . Or even when . That 's the thing I mind . " " What will ? " " The shabbiness . " When he got up from the carpet , he studied the piano , ran a nail so lightly over the full keyboard that only one or two notes spoke . Came down hard forefinger , on middle C. " Shall I phone her ? You did n't say . " When I did n't answer at once , he slapped a pillow . Then the sofa . No dust flew , as it used to do . " I have his number . I talk to him . "  |p183I  picked up the capsule , still sticky from his hand . " I 'd begin  --  not calling . " He lay down slow , white , his eyes ranging the ceiling . I could give him his pill . I owed him something . I searched the room , looking for it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This room I mean . You sure one-upped me there . " Buddy looked at the wall . The computer-room , with its Zebel must be just outside , then the common room , the business ones and the pleasure ones , circled tight and interdisciplined , out to the city periphery that viewers up here owned . " You do n't mind about that , huh ? You do n't mind I one-upped you on that . " He smiled . " No , I like it , " I said . " It makes me feel safe . " When he slept , I laid the throw over him and lay down on the other sofa , our heads almost touching . Before I had television in my room we listened to the radio like that . Or the record player . Falling asleep until Maeve called . One thing I had managed for him tonight . He got to sleep without that capsule . I got up after a while and flushed it down the toilet . Toilet was handy here ; food would come on carts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be as easy as dialing a prayer . And when she got here , no matter her size and shape for the night , that brilliant band of city windows would hem her in like a diamondbroker'sinventory . Except for the room 's having no windowsitself , and a certain taint in the air of crushedp184apartments , it would be a handy place to live . I did n't suppose he 'd figured in the computer that was just outside . I lay there , figuring it . Now and then I could feel his breath on me , irregular . I could see how a letter to a son could be hard . Full of the naked family facts . So instead he wrote those crummy , humbly notes I got all year , full of his humility to my youth . Like the one I got in Paris that day and left on the washbasin , hoping the ink would run . He writes them virile , with a felt pen . " Full of his duty to me  --  what shit is that of mine ? " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the bad spot . When she was coming down , she said , she always had trouble remembering who she was . She 'd been repeating all the names she 'd been christened with . " Monica Mary , shit . Isadora , shit . " She croaked . " Wigglesworth , shit . " She gave a hoot of laughter . " Ellsworth . " She took a deep breath . " Shit . When all we want  --  . " I wiped the spit from her hair . She was down . When she was leaving , she offered me her applecheek . The rest of her had n't been much . " Thanks for the assist . Maybe it 'll work out for me with those kids in Boston . If I can be an assist , to them . " He used to breathe over me like this , in myyouth-bed . When I got a full-sized one , he stopped , andI was glad . I was king of the mountain then . They told me so daily . It made him angry now . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other thing . " I was on the same trip as her , really , I could smellp185how it should have been . Never spelled out or pressed , but a birthright too . A sense of my duty  --  to them . It 's no trick at all to break away from a family . I ca n't understand the public concern . You can cut up a family in one day 's night . With the facts . As a oneminutefather , I knew that . But where do the facts go then ? Can they be saved ? Maybe there 's a vocation in that . I thought I heard the computer breathing , outside , telling me so . But it was only my father . " Doughty , " my father murmured , rolling deeper on his reef . " Blinded . They want permission to put me away . " We sup with devils , " I said . In front of the computer it was cool as a field of cucumbers nobody had planted yet . I lay down on the rug with my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never came . I want to live in a room that is real . What 's smart about me ? What 's dumb ? I went to see Janacek . Sitting behind a desk , he looks like a man with a lion 's head over his shoulders . But you can see the seam where it stops . " How is she ? " " Calm . "  |p186I  doubted that . But it must be a relief to her that the sadness is n't joint anymore . " Want to tell me where she is ? " " Better not . " He really believes we have n't guessed . " Does she want to see me ? " " Rather not . " He gazes at me without triumph . He must have to do this sort of thing all the time . For the families of the patients he is protecting from their families . " She decide that ? " He nodded . I believed him . She 's smarter than Buddy there . The Bunty-doll  --  she 's throwing it away . " Want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first . I 'll watch your earring . " He laughed . " Your mother was miming the stress put upon her , " he said artistically . " Those weights . " " Screw that . It 's a simple country device . Let the porch fall . " I could see her standing on the loaded back porch . Looking out . At the brambles . " Amenia ? Ah well , we believe in dwelling more on things that happen now . " " Me  --  I 'm reading a book about time-binding . " I was reading everything I could on that , and giving myself a course in the newest computer applications as well . And I was reading Babbidge at last . " You know we 're the only animal does that ? Binds itself to time ? Evenp187the king of beasts does n't do that . Or so they say . " I was watching his ear-wire , but it was n't sending . " I 'm not so sure though . Time 's an audience . Have n't you watched even animals want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Animals . " I thought I could smell the camp on him . Far , far back in memory veins he no longer thought funneled that black blood to his heart . " Sure , you know . Performing dogs . Horses at dressage . " I mixed them more recklessly . " Flea circuses . Seals , kangaroos . Teddy bears . " The earring jumped . " Shall we talk about your mother , please ? I have only this hour to spare . " He wanted to know . Already she was puzzling him . He was formed to be puzzled if any child was . His own mother , sitting in her Queens kitchen all these years , folding gingham and ironing it , before the highest court . Jasmin went there once without his knowing . No gas in that kitchen . All electric . Very clean . No bones in the Disposall ; it wo n't take them . But she was proud of it . When she died , he thought he had disposed of her . " A lot boils down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . In front of a good one . Best I could find . " " God ? " he said politely . I burst out laughing . " Ah . Another doctor , then . " I could n't laugh twice . " A computer works by a mag/nitude of association , too . Only it is n't burdened with its own time sense . It does n't have that dimension . For it , time is n't either a poison or an antidote . Time is only a test . And one life is n't long enough for all the storage it can take ... Like if you could find a way to record your life in a logo , you might have something . When you checked back . " He leans back . The better to observe me , he thinks . The resemblance is remarkable . Eyes used to seeing the kill brought in . The big cat 's nose that must smell itself more than anything . " A computer . Very chic . But will it listen ? Like me now ?

" There was one picture that said other , and one said given , but those two were bespoke . And one , the raindrops said Deary : she thought that was kind of nice  --  did I ? " Cooperative art , the village is full of it , though , she said , and buried her head in my neck . " I asked her why she chose nihil .

" " I keep wondering if I should have broken in on her , that 's all . " I could have , once . He could n't have . Too late for him , by then . He knows that .

" " What you said . Hunting necessity . I remembered it . He was shivering like a cat about to spring . Forward . Or back . " What we say of the dead  --  that 's our language too , Jannie , is n't it ? I never had anybody dead before . Much . " " Wait till you have hundreds . All the same age . " That whisper . How often she must have had to hearit , talking of the dead . " The same age ? " " As yourself . " So that 's why I came to him . K-k-k . Blood soy .

" Then you go home . He was listening . It does help . " I get a bug sometimes , " I said . " Intestinal . " " All the deaths you did n't die , " Jannie said . " What do you do about it ? " " I wear an earring . " He got to his feet . " Time 's up . Sorry . " Somebody ought to touch that seam of his . I was n't afraid any more . " Listen , Jannie , " I said quick . " Watch out . About her audience . Maeve 's . Buddy could take it small at home , because he had his business scope . But she never had a scope . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's why her white hair looks too old for her . She stayed young . " How could I tell him quick enough ? " She dwarfed the world down to him . " " Okay , Bunty . . . Okay , young man . " He had opened the door . The next comer , a tyke , was standing there patiently . It sobered us both . " I 'm calling myself Quentin now . When you go home  --  tell her that . " He half-closed the door again . " One of her guys ? You were the only one . " So that 's why I came to him . To be told.  | " I did n't pay in , did I Jannie ? A machine would have done better . If properly set . " He does n't answer . We 've done our bit for each other , that 's all . But I 'm not his style of listener . I opened the door to the tyke . Leaned down to him . " Touch his earring . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it 'll be all right about Maeve . Jannie will talk to her like to a child . And she will cradle him . I went to see my father , who was in the kidneymachine . Two of the cousins were just leaving him . One sister said loud in my right ear " Thank God  --  . " The other , softly into my left one , "  --  that he can afford to pay for it . " We do n't mention Maeve . Blum tried to get in touch with her . No soap , but Blum tried . The family is rallying round . All of us . Because Buddy wants to talk about Maeve . And Buddy is going to be lost . I talk to him about her , about everything . He 's helplessnow ; even at his best he ca n't walk much , or screw , or work . And that  --  helps . Watching him on the machine is like watching ap193birth . Of a full-grown man .

I have the controlling shares . Plus the right to buy themp195out at any time , at market value , plus a certain sum not less than their joint compensation . Based on their salary for that fiscal year  --  for the next five years . That was the deal . " I leaned back . Some men lean forward when they mean to make a deal , some back . I see it all the time at One Chase . Getting there a little early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monday-Tuesday , a little late . " Got the cash to do it ? " " Got the  --  . " He chuckled . I knew he did . Just doing everything I can . " Then will you ? " " Who for ? " It 's been ravaging him . I 'm wearing a pair of shades I bought one Saturday night in Montmartre , because everybody seemed to be wearing them to keep their eyes from exploding in the fireworks of spring . Purple-green lenses ( very popular that year with cyclists ) that reminded me of the Jap beetlesI had collected all one summer and kept in a jar on a window-ledge , until Doorman Shannon , spotting one , flicked the little mirror-back plague from my palm . " Want to murder the park ? " he said . Sure enough , in Paris the next morning , the lenses turned out to be reflectors on their other side . So now , all that summer in Paris is an iridescent jar . And Buddy , looking at himself in my shades , sees a clean , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saw Shannon the other day , remember him ? Thep196doorman , at old 270 East . He 's still working , two doors down . " I 'd passed him slowly but without stopping , thinking of causes and effects . " Sure , Quent ; I recall he had your same hair . " Buddy knows in a deal you sometimes shoot out sideways ; he 's even savoring it . But he 's short on time . " I asked you , Quent . " He likes calling me that . " Who for ? " I leaned farther back . They had good armchairs in that hospital . To sustain the guests . " For me . " " Y  --  . But you just quit architecture . " He 's afraid I 'm a quitter . They always are . " Money is architecture . " A tour of his office taught me that . " Builds houses , for sure . " His eyes veiled themselves , before he reached for his own shades , **25;14601;TOOLONG . " But I 've an idea you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MIT ? " " A computer is architecture . I 'll teach it that . " I leaned forward . " Other day , I finally looked up the word actuary . ' Jesus . " I pulled the dictionary page from my pocket . Like an eye that might explode . " One whose profession is to solve monetary problems depending on Interest and Probability , in connection with life , fire , or other accidents . " Italics mine . " Insurance actuary ? Like Abe ? You want to go back to being that ? "  |p197I  wondered if Abe 'd ever written him letters . I put the page back in my pocket . If I ever had office stationery , I 'd put that quote on it . If I ever had a son . " Why could n't a computer handle all the probabilities ? " " What others are there ? " I could see them  --  for him . Memory and sadness , and the glass cage of family that had crashed from him , all joined together , keeping him alive and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a man 's throat . Even so , I whispered . " Why could n't it help organize  --  a whole single life ? " He reached out and took off my shades . To see if I 'm nuts . Or to make plain he thinks I must be . Any layman would say so at once . But he 's had the course . And already he 's reacting like the first man at MIT I spoke to . And the second , and the one those two brought in , a day after . He 's already sold . Just to say it , sells them . Just to hear it . " Can youimplement ? " they say , if they 're on the inside  --  and starttelling you how . Just to think it . The chance of seeingyour whole life , in a clear eye-cup  --  it maddens us . Onceit must have been like that when they listened to Freud . " You could end up providing a service just likelaundry , " I said , not forgetting to laugh . A consultationservice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Not just for payrolls , or for interplanetary , either . Fordown here . And not just for crowds . You 'd need wholebanks of 7090 's , or better . " It would be a life-bank likethe records the government is building . Only every manp198for himself . " But all I 'd need to begin is old Batface . And me . Experiment on yourself , that 's in the tradition , the MIT guy said . Pleased . Data processing 's a whole life for you kids , is n't it . Anyway for a thesis , it will do . I was hoarse , and no wonder . I 'd just written him the hardest letter of my life . " In exchange , I 'll handle Dave and Sol for you , " I said . " I 'll learn the banking business , so 's I can handle them . " " Handling . That all it is to you . " " I have got ambition , Buddy . Just not the old ones . Just  --  not yours . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different . That 's what 's so sad . " The hardest thing is still to tell , Buddy . " " Tell it . " " I want to bring in Maeve . " He leaned forward . " I saw Janacek . He 's not a man to stay with steady . But he 's very needy . So I do n't know how long it will take . " " Maeve down at the office again ? You flatter yourself . " But he was still leaning . " You 'll see . " I do n't tell him I plan to bring her in as a kind of partner eventually  --  the kind he would never let her be . Maeve once studied to be a broker , Blum said . I can just see her handling Sol and Dave . Just hold yourself open for anything , I 'll tell her . Like people our age . You can do it . You did it once.  | " Yes , I can see it , " Buddy said . " It 'll happen when I die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his tortoise-shellson my nose . Put my shades on his . I leaned forward . I saw blackly through his lenses . Behind mine , were his eyes exploding ? It was a long time until spring . In the mirror-lenses , I saw myself , in him . " Snap out of it , " I said . " It 's only a business deal . Abe liked Christian help , did n't he ? For the humility . " The air in a hospital reverberates anyway  --  so why not ? " Wo n't you want to travel again soon ? " he said , from behind . And from between his teeth . " Nossuh . " I could feel my old jauntiness rising between us . " I 'll be a world-bum at home . " When I got up to leave , he was staring hopefully . I had brought him the right pill . I was n't at all sure Maeve would ever come back . But meanwhile it all helps , along with the kidney machine . We are taking his wastes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shades . " You were brought up to expect the best , that 's all . Us to expect the worst . It 'll work out . " " Smart , " he said . " Very smart . " Outside the room , I stood against a wall , exhausted . Love is obligation . You lean forward ; you lean back . A nurse came along . " What 's the matter , kiddo ? " When I raised my head , she said " Uh  --  0000h ... Kid-do . " Pretty girl , prepared to make some/thing of it . When she saw I could n't , she put a hand up , and patted . My shoulder . My cheek . Smiled . And went on her way . Grace always breaks me up . Anybody 's . My tears for him sluiced through my fingers like his money . Nothing I could do for him either way . Live an imitation life , you get an imitation death . He went to see Father Melchior . These days , when he left the office , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighborhoods . The days were growing cold and he wore his jacket again for the first time . Souvenir of the hunting world his father had tried to put him in , it brought him back the guerrilla ways of summer . Ducking two trucks , he let a Yellow Cab tickle his heel , stopped it dead on his turf  --  he had the light with him  --  said , " Yalla ? " to it as city boys used to do , and made it to the faded red-brick compound across the street , and up a set of those high Roman Catholic steps . ... This is the neighborhood Shannon once came from . Found him going on his lunch hour like always , for a sandwich and a snifter at his brother-in-law 's bar . Shannon 's father worked in a saloon on Ninth Avenue all his life . The brother-in-law 's is still on Second Avenue , next door to a thrift shop . Used to be called Dugout For Buddies , now it 's the Green Beret  --  that 's how youp201missed it . Sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be hard , doing these ten blocks two ways every lunchtime ; when I ca n't , I 'll quit for good . Set ' em up , he said , when we were inside ; here 's one of my boys . Used to steal my quarters , he said , leering fondly . Sure an ' it 's Eagle Eye , I said , fellas , when the boy came up to me . The line at the bar laughed ; they knew he did n't remember me . " He do n't play that shillgamehere . " When they wanted to know where I 'd been in the war , I said India . On reconnaissance . He 's looking for a profession , Shannon said . Sanitation was still good , the bar-line said . Union tight as drum . But the Port Authority is still open . He 's in with his father , you boobies . Shannon made eyes at them to let me ante for the beer after all . He 's a tenant , Shannon said . Even so , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roll in along with the stones ; not many spars any more but lots of paper , and often it still says something readable , and just as you can bear to wrench your eyes away from that undertow , over there 's a button someone wore last week or eighty years ago  --  and you tug it out  --  saved . Not yours , but related ; nothing is lost . Inside , the rectory feels like a trained audience . Hushed and respectful to all the sin and virtue that must come calling here . The old girl who led him into the empty study , telling him to wait , looked ready to clap for either side of it . Since he 'd been summoned here , he could n't tell her which . The window here was decorated for the sea/son  --  cut-outs and pumpkins , on 42nd Street ! Bottom remains of Hell 's Kitchen , still flowing with meat and fish and wholesale river air at the market end , working their way on up , from pimples-and-stilletto boys to that gun store just off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Main Library . And Bryant Park . There were connections everywhere . He was findingthem . Coming out into the streets after a heady day at his console made him feel like an astronomer grounding himself , half-embarrassed at the purity of his work . Often it seemed to him that it was the computers who had the living-mindedness , and were only waiting to help the human mechanism free itself of the rote of history that held us back . He was no longer trying to record himself as the prime aim ; that was the old postuterinedream with which the psychiatrists had already grabbed off half a century . Process was the reality . No telling when  --  improvising one day at his keyboard  --  he might find another one . He still went regularly to Cambridge , for workouts with " the boys "  --  as they called themselves  --  a group of men who had broken off from the university to form an agency for private projects , some as far-out as his , which they had housed in a ramped Bauhaus cube bought from one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 128 . Weekdays , his hours in the office kept him from getting too rarified . Sometimes , with a weekend coming up , and when he felt his third-person sense of himself had honed itselfp203down to the dangerline , he would give them a call : " Tell your boss , Bronstein says schizophrenia lurks  --  and how are you , Miss Cathcart ? "  --  and whoever wanted a New York blow-out would fly down , bringing along any new material that interested them . Since he had put in a second console , more often , they sent somebody down on their own ,  --  like kids to the boy with the most Tinker Toys . Salesmen of the infinite , he termed them privately  --  or in that daily-recorded realm which had once been private . Some had Radcliffe wives they were true to in the sack as well as the head ; others wanted him to help them attack Sex City , in the bearded rockstylethat was their Rotary . His celibacy of the moment did n't frighten him . They were all ten years older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one by one , no crony had as yet occurred ; perhaps he was too old for it . Or they were too eager-beaver for him , on the commercial side of their own marvels . Since his last ploy with Buddy , he had been avoiding that . Though he knew as well as they , that every time pure science had stuck a real needle in the infinite , money for somebody had streamed out . Sometimes , fantasy had them sending him down a girl . Though they had girls on the staff , he had never asked ; the scenario required that she be sent . Some Madame Curie-to-be , though not necessarily with him  --  to whom , after a hard day together sifting for a new language in all the modes of expression that were n't taken for granted any more , he could say " Allo , allo . Dos veedanya . Come close . " All the intellectual girlsp204were gaudy beauties now , like from a new race of testtubeheroines . Meanwhile , Route 128 must now and then say what always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " .... Or did dos veedanya mean Good-bye ' ? .. . " Let me look at you , " Melchior said deep . " I have n't seen you since . " He turned me to the light . " You look fine . " He 'd only seen me once . And I no longer stand for social talk . Like that language must be changed . If we 're to find the other one . " Anybody 's superior who 's alive . Even a son . You ca n't help feeling it . " He has a great stone smile , like a natural phenomenonyou can drive to see every Sunday , afterwards puttinga sticker on the car to say you 've been . Underneath though , is his hugeness different ?  --  I only saw him once . He wears the smile like it 's just given him . First they send for you . Then they wait for you to talk . " Thought priests had to be strictly on norm , " I said . " Size and everything . " Witkower 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little finger had been cut off . Melchior 's hand , the right one , perches on him like a rabbit , undisturbed by his chuckles . " In Friesland , I am normal . "  | " Friesland . I always wanted to go there . " No reindeer but sub-Arctic dreams of them , and an endless skin of sea , spring like a short , bright-green pain . And the seven-foot people , like the Houyhnhnms surely , with seven-foot spirits to match  --  what a way to dwarf the world . " My grandmother was born in the town where Jonathan Swift went to school . " " Ah-h  --  uh ? " Meaning  --  if he did n't know what I was talking about , all was still received in the name of the angels . And the burden was still on me , to speak up . I am trying . To say what I think  --  daily . But it 's much harder when someone is listening personally . Or worse  --  theologically .

Or a horse ? " We were under the impression  --  that Mrs. Reeves  --  " No , Batface . It shouldn't.  | " Had the money ? " Poor Reeves . I did n't want to incriminate her . " I could be wrong .

" " Mrs. Reeves is  --  taking instruction . " " From Gran ? " I started to laugh . Feeling in my pocket for Gran 's spidery witch-note . " Yeah , she has gits . Though I ca n't see Reeves as a kleptomaniac . " At the Miami-Hilton especially . " Pardon . " He gave it the German pronunciation . I took out the folded note . " The note from her you gave me that day . Day I came back from Wales . I stuck it away . Just came across it this morning . " He put on square specs . " Taffy was a Welshman . ' " That was all . He handed it back . " What does that mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Taffy was a thief . ' When I was a kid . I stole a couple of old silver spoons from her . To give to Maeve.

Is that religious objectivity ? " " I mean the word , Mr. Bronstein . I hear it at theseminary all the time . Among the younger ones . " " Instead of good ' , you mean ? " He nodded . " When an English says That 's kind ' , he used to mean only That 's nice ' . But now  --  " " It 's got its emotion back ? " He likes to nod , and wait . Interlocutary conversion .

So I put my head down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's a word comes to mind when you think of animals . " He asked me to repeat : I spoke too low . " Like Gran stinks as a person .

" " The best dialogue is between a p-person , and a  --  what you call a machine . " He stared at me . When the woman came in , he said , " Mrs. McMurter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bottle of wine . " We fell silent . I wondered what Friesland women were like . I smelled religion cooking . Or the creeping daily habit of it , that was set to rise like dough in the back of a bake shop , and ended every morning in a yeastly bread-image of God . " The house listens for you , does n't it ? Even when you do n't understand things . " " The church does . " When the woman brought the tray , he set out the glasses , put biscuits and cheese to one side of each of us , in equal portions , like a referee , then opened the bottles  --  drawing each cork as smooth as I ever saw it done  --  and set the bottles center field table and opposite each other , like guns . " Rhine wine , " I said . " For dueling . " Then it struck me . He was being kind to me . I let him pour . Then I took out the four joints I still had from El Paradiso @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd known they were there all the time . But they were for safari . I held them out . " I drink your wine . You smoke my smoke . " That sounded Indian to me . Hop-hop , into the war dance . He lumbered to the sliding door , rolled it shut , and listened . Like a turnkey , but shutting in himself . Onp20942nd Street , whose rumble I could still faintly hear . The ways people can shut themselves up , and still think themselves out in the street with the common man , always interest me . As if I 've always known I was going to have to do some of that myself . Libraries , study halls . Seminaries . Offices . And all the time , the common man is doing the same thing . " I knew a man shut himself up in a tennis club . Winters . Came into Boston once a week to give our school indoor lessons . And to play bridge with his wife . " He sat down opposite me . " You 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " What 's the Christian for Oy ' ? " His laugh was enormous . " You 're a card . " " That was last month . " But I could feel the talent coming back in me like a jaunty flower , up from the windpipe to the head again , with lesser branches for the ears . " You have to listen , to be a card . " To friends . Though it does n't look like it . " Where 'd you learn that word ? " " We have a few , here . " " This the seminary ? " " The building in back . " I reached out and touched the joint he was holding . " Keep it for later , if you want  --  that 's okay . " I could see the little carbuncle of greed near his eye . Better than he could see the hungry quiver at the back of my nose ? " Each to his own gormay ? Why not ? "  |p210So  it ended up he drank his wine , I smoked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think it was like in church ; to me it was Indian . Once , I used to count up the cronies , like I never did with the girls . Now I did it again , in a sort of wood-touching . Ike , Witkower . Emilio from Siena . Betts . I could n't quite add Melchior . But he had a face like a good ogre . Or a seven-foot horse . I slipped on my shades . " Take it easy , " Melchior said . " I 'm just a machine . " " Yeah . But I can see the building at the back . " He sipped , easy . " We do n't shanghai . " " You been a sailor ? " " Padre on a troopship . " " Which war ? " He spread his hands . " Africa . " We tippled on . When I coughed once ; he did n't laugh . Really I was trembling , with what I had to say to him . " Nice jacket you have . Had one like it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Hunting World . Has as many pocketsas a head . Have n't worn it since I got back . " " Where from ? " " London , Paris , the Low Countries . India . Wales . " " Odd itinerary . " " Yeah . " India sticks out . " How did you come to do it ? "  | " Deferment , " I said . " How did you get to the Congo ? " " My mother was Belgian . She brought me up in her country . Where I was not normal . " His grin was huge . Fixed . He put wine in it . " Orphan ? " " I had a mother . " " Oh . " A bastard . " Thought that was a blemish too . " " Pardon ? " " Thought a  --  . " The joint was n't getting anywhere . "  --  bastard could n't go for priest . " He put his big rabbit-hand on the table , as if might get away . " Sorry . Hard to rap , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Dialogue . " " On the contrary . Only now I am the person . You are the machine . " " Ask me a question then , " I said . He took the cigarette from my fingers , sniffed it , put it down on the ashtray . I took his wine glass and set it away from him . He squinted at me sideways . As if I were his wine glass now . Came close enough to peer into my shades , like an oculist . Raised one finger , wiggling at his image there . " What are the stations of the Cross ? " I jumped back . " Jesus . "  |p212He  giggled . " The Jewish for Christ ? " I was meanwhile feeling something hard against my lower back , between me and the chair . The Inquisition , maybe . " How 's Archie , by the way ? He going to be the black for it ? " " Poor Archie 's left us . " He giggled again . " For Ireland ? " " Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parish here , sons and grandsons of the old Hell 's Kitcheners . He said they were too militant . " " You seven-footers , have to watch yourselves , huh . He go back to the game ? " " No , the Congo . Something wrong with that chair ? " I was rubbing like a cat for the pleasure of it , againstan object in the jacket somewhere , whose shape I couldalmost define . " Ants in the pants ? Archie had them too . I told him what the abbot said to me when I was his age . Son , you belong better in the order of St. Benedict . ' What 's that order ? ' I said  --  I never heard of it . ' Archie neither . So I told him what the abbot told me . The order of St. Benedict , Melchior . Two heads on one pillow ' . " " Find plenty in the Congo . " " I was already a padre , " he said . The drink was gone , the joints burnt to ash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the mark . Nobody said go . I saw how his hand could be like my stutter , a tic from deep down , made public . Only , most tics mimed grotesquely or even sang , blurting up the life denied.  |p213His  hand sat on display , like the photos of themselves some savages hang around the neck as happy tokens from the other world . Had it always under his eye  --  this heavy hare that his God had made of him . " Wooden pillows , they have out there , " I said . " No , that 's Japan . " The jacket is short on me . The object in its lining could be the reed flute that I bought from a blind boy in the plane stop at Karachi . Or it could be the joss stick I picked up at Bett 's grave . I knew it was neither of them . " Archie means to work for peace as well . Mind if I say something , Mr. Bronstein ? " " Do . " I stood up , shaking out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Not fit for this world , you mean . " " Fit to conquer it . The only ones who ever will . " " Ah , come on . " Back of the band for bullet-clips , behind the flaskpocket , and the patented waterproof oilskin ones for matches and holster  --  in case of rhino  --  there was a seam for a drawstring I never used , running all around the garment to its other side , where the slits were for pasport , letters of identification and money-clip  --  and a note-pad , erasable with steel stylus , for taking bushnotes . I pulled the drawstring , shook the coat hard , and my knife fell out of it . Along with a forgotten stash of flat money , and a couple of postcards . " Thought I 'd lost it . It 's called The Bush Wife . " No matter what the salesman called it . I waggledp214some of its parts , with love for their domestic cunning , from the sliderule-and-level , file and burning-glass division , to the two blades  --  one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I flipped it suddenly . Out sprang the nearest single answer to a switchblade . What 's that ? ' Buddy 'd said to the salesman . He 'd looked us straight in the face . For wild boar . What 's that for , the girls ask . Harakiri , the brave boy replies . I held it out to Melchior , blade up . " Instructions ? Give or get . " " Made a lot of converts in my time . For and against . " So it was an impasse . And the joint would n't take . I do n't know how long it was before I began to hear what the house was saying . Or he began to listen , in a way that let me feed him the questions I could answer . And let him answer the house . As if the wine in him was rising in me . And what I 'd smoked , was wafting him . " What 's it like ? To be an heir ? " " I 've the kind of family wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " All the deaths we did n't die  --  " I said " That would be a family . " And the lives we did n't live ? He did n't ask it . But I heard . Outside , the street gave a loud whine . Stretching itself , to get in here ? Not a chance . " Near the end of the calendar year , " I said , " the pity everybody has for everybody has grown to the size of a pumpkin . You hollow out yours , cut a mouth ofp215teeth in it , and burn a candle in its head for all their souls . Around Christmas-time , you can usually get rid of it . " I was never able to . Or did he say that ? Across the table , I saw what was wrong with him . " You 're in mufti , " I said . " Oh , poor man . " It was an old suit , European surely , too cheap ever to have been a good brown , too greenish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have no money . I 've been spoiled . That 's what they call a spoiled priest . " But his smile was almost his own when he bent down to himself . " I leave , Saturday . " " Leaving here , you mean  --  or  --  " He would n't look up . " Or . " That why I 'm here ? " Need a place to stay ? " I said . " I shall be staying with a friend 's . With a friend 's relatives , that is , a brother . Until my job starts . And until she can take her vows . " " The veil ? " " Oh , no . No , no . " That hand of his crossed to the other and clasped it . " She and I wo n't have much . . . apparently . I 'm not a practical man . But we shall manage . " " Where 's your job to be ? " " At the Museum of Modern Art . As a guard . Not my field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
