The stock market lives by its crystal ball . For the past five weeks , the belief that interest rates have passed their peak has lifted share prices and investors ' spirits in approximately equal measure . The " baby bank rally , " as brokers have dubbed the winter rebound , draws some of its support from cuts in the prime lending rate , from 8% to 8% , by a handful of small banks . Though executives of most major banks have scoffed at the reductions as premature , last week 's mix of economic fact and forecast strengthened Wall Street 's conviction that easier money is on the way . One indication : the Dow-Jones Municipal Bond index declined last week to 6% , the lowest level since last October . <P> A.W . Clausen , president of the Bank of America , predicted a one-half of 1% drop in the U.S. prime rate " in the next two or three months . " He added that the rate could fall by a full percentage point during 1970 , and perhaps more if the economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to interest rates-housing and construction companies , utilities , savings and loan associations and banks-led last week 's advance . On the New York Stock Exchange , the Dow-Jones industrial average rose 6 points this week , a gain of 40 points from its seven-year low of 744 on Jan. 30 . The rally has been notable for its lack of speculative froth . Many glamour stocks have behaved erratically , up one day , down the next , while blue chips have surged ahead . General Motors , for example , gained $3 a share last week and long-depressed General Electric was up $5 . <P> Although expectations of an end to the 15-month-old bear market have proved false before , many brokers now feel that a psychological barrier has been passed . " We 're getting our shopping list ready , " says Norton Reamer , vice president of Putnam Management Co. , which runs eight mutual funds with $1.8 billion assets . " We 're looking specifically for depressed stocks that would benefit from improved consumer spending , which we expect later this year . " Kenneth Ward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analysts , says : " It is bound to take time , but the market is beginning to look around the corner . " <P> Economists consider stock prices to be a leading indicator of future business conditions . In the four recessions of the past 20 years , the stock market declined before the economy did and turned up anywhere from three to ten months before the economy . The tantalizing question is whether history will once again repeat itself . Hardly any analysts are yet willing to call the rally the start of a bull market , but the clouds do seem to be thinning a bit .
