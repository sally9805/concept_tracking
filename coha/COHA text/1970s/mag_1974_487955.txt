France . What has this to do with the story 's main drift ? There is presumed to be irony or pathos in the presence of the pure and dedicated revolutionary ordered out of France while the country is rotten-ready for a great upheayal . The implication also is that if Trotsky had remained in France he might have guided the Left during the February riots of 1936 , and its first overt strug  --  gle with the Fascists . The event itself is not shown , and Trotsky  --  made absurd by a silly piece of casting  --  could not possibly have altered the trend of the times . All this is still window dressing . The heart of the matter is the " mystery " of Stavisky 's character . He is a foreigner  --  the insulting French term is mOteque  --  of Russian-Jewish origin whose father , an honest little merchant , committed suicide because of his son 's criminal , be- havior . Stavisky is set forth as an imagi- native , pleasure loving , markedly roman  --  tic scapegrace who gets his kicks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , most important , suffers from a death wish . Is this due to guilt feelings , alienation , despair , pathology ? We never learn ; there are only hints . What we see - aims at ' many targets without hit  --  ting any in a conclusive fashion . The performances by Belmondo , Perier and especially Boyer are as slick as can be , tion . But so much of it is so persistently dark and depressed , so obdurately re  --  sistant to anything but the most laconic utterance in speech or gesture that it forfeits the possibility of that pleasure which tragedy as much as any other mode must offer . To return to The Middle of the World : it is they story of an affair be  --  tween a pleasant middle-class engineer of peasant parentage and an Italian waitress at the bar of a hotel in a small country town in central Switzerland , thOught of as " the middle of the world " ? also sug  --  gestive through the film 's title of the " norm " of Western civilization . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her kindly , on her account even neglects his chance to be elected to a government post , and is eager to divorce his wife and marry the waitress , buy a proper home for her to live in , etc . But the girl , who seems to like him a lot and responds to him enthusiastically in the act of love , finally decides to leave the town and him  --  and then takes a job in a Zurich factory . Why ? Because , , as we assume and Tanner tells us ex  --  plicitly in his program notes , the man , limited by his environment and its nor  --  mal bourgeois habit of - life , fails , for all his good will , to realize that the girl wants to be known more profoundly than through the satisfaction of their sexual or possible marital relationship , She wants to be something more than the Object of his desire or protection . She wants to grow and change ; he pre  --  sumably can not do so or guess at what she unwittingly seeks . ' As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now almostcommonplace . But most of the picture is devoted to repeated and very agreeably handled scenes of love  --  making interspersed with shots of the unchanging natural surroundings . The girl occasionally says she wishes to be by herself ; he does n't quite understand this , but acquiesces . We also see her take a long , carefree walk alone in a larger town . A voice-over instructs us that she does n't know what she wants , only what she does n't want . It is true that the girl is supposed to be largely inarticulate . But if the form of the picture were right in its visual specifics we ' would learn more about her than we can now gather from hearsay . We could intuit her state of being in the enacted minutiae of her behavior . In the elliptic treatment of the picture 's material we must assume that the man ca n't develop because of his bourgeois ' mentality and that the girl is seeking to become a true person ? an assumption which springs from a definite ideology with which we may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
