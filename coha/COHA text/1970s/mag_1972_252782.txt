Pint-sized Jeno Paulucci is a blend of tough tycoon and softhearted humanitarian . Twice in the past 25 years he has built multimillion-dollar enterprises in the turbulent food-packaging business . At the same time he has taken pride in hiring and training the handicapped and others usually considered unemployable , many of them eligible for welfare payments . More than half of Paulucci 's employees in Duluth , Minn. , are missing fingers , must wear neck or leg braces , or are deaf mutes , mentally retarded , partially blind , alcoholics or ex-prisoners . As a result , the President 's Committee on Employment of the Handicapped and the National Association of Manufacturers have just picked Paulucci to receive the Employer of the Year citation . <P> Paulucci , 54 , an Italian immigrant 's son , started in the food business helping his mother sell home-canned pasta in her living room . In 1947 he borrowed $2,500 and created Chun King , the purveyor of canned Chinese food . He sold out to tobacco giant R.J. Reynolds in 1966 for $63 million in cash , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pizza and other foods . Last year Jeno 's sales were $50 million . Customers apparently like the products better than Consumer Reports does ; in the June issue it rated several types of Jeno 's Pizza " not acceptable " because they contained " excessive " amounts of bacteria . Jeno 's spokesmen deny the charge . <P> There is no debate , however , about the quality of the company 's workers . Paulucci insists that his employment policy is not a charitable act , but " serves our own interest . " The company 's handicapped employees are exceptionally hard workers who make few mistakes ; turnover is extremely low and absenteeism near zero . Booz , Allen &; Hamilton consultants were amazed by what one of them called " an atmosphere in which everyone works as hard and is as dedicated as if he were a member of a religious cult .
