Flamboyant O. Roy Chalk has made millions in Manhattan real estate , but as a transportation magnate he has sometimes spun his wheels . He failed in a bid to buy the New York City subway system some years ago , and the deteriorating bus service provided by his D.C. Transit System has annoyed Washingtonians . He founded Trans Caribbean Airways in 1945 , and has since run it as a family company : his wife is secretary and interior decorator , his brother-in-law is executive vice president , and a son-in-law is a director . The line lost money heavily last year , and Chalk has for some time been trying to sell it . Last week American Airlines agreed to purchase Trans Caribbean for about $18 million worth of stock . <P> Many Routes , Few Flights . Trans Caribbean pioneered low-fare service between New York and San Juan ; in 1958 it became the first and only U.S. airline to make the jump from non-sked to scheduled carrier . But in recent years it has lost so much traffic to Pan American and Eastern that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first-class seats and 58.5% of those in the coach section . Since 1968 , Trans Caribbean has picked up new routes to the Virgin Islands , Haiti and the Netherlands Antilles . It has been unable to exploit these routes fully because its fleet consists of only nine jets . In the twelve months ending Nov. 30 , Trans Caribbean actually flew only 81% of its scheduled aircraft miles . Many flights were cancelled for mechanical reasons or because of bad weather . <P> Chalk 's line , which flies only out of New York , Newark and Washington , sorely needs the traffic that American can generate for it . By taking over Trans Caribbean 's routes , American plans to fly vacationers from such cities as Boston , Chicago and Detroit to the Caribbean rather than making them transfer to other lines at coastal airports . The addition of Trans Caribbean would also make American , which hopes to begin flights to Hawaii and the South Pacific this year , a two-ocean airline . <P> Big Share . The proposed merger continues a movement toward airline consolidations that began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first major merger since 1961 . If the Government allows American to buy out Trans Caribbean , Chalk will become probably the largest individual shareholder in American . He would get approximately 245,000 common shares , based on his last reported Trans Caribbean holdings . That would easily be enough to entitle him to a seat on the American board . Airline men think , however , that Chalk has had about enough of transportation ventures and will devote himself mostly to his other interests , which include radio and television stations and newspapers .
