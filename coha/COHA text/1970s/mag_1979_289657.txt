Mickey Rooney gets his second chance in Sugar Babies <P> Forty years ago , when people still cried at tearjerkers , it would have made a great movie . A cheeky kid becomes the country 's top box office draw , goes off to war , comes back and discovers that nobody loves a 30-year-old brat . He spends too much , drinks too much and wives too much . At the studios , they do n't even know his name , except as a joke . He gets older , paunchier and balder , but though few seem to know it , he is still one of the best actors in the business . Then he finds himself in his first Broadway show . It opens , the critics turn handsprings , and that cheeky kid is once more swaggering down the block-Puck in middle age . <P> Today such a plot would be laughed out of town , unless , of course , it was called The Mickey Rooney Story .

Mickey 's mother took him to California and got him parts in films ; his big break came in 1937 when MGM cast him as Andy Hardy , the typical small town boy , in A Family Affair . <P> Nobody expected very much from the film , but to an America just emerging from the Depression the story of the Hardy family was a symbol of what was best in the country . MGM quickly scheduled sequels , and in 1939 and 1940 Mickey was the box office king , bigger than Gable or Tracy . He made $5,000 a week - in real dollars . His teen-age escapades became staples of the gossip columns , and the studio hired a male duenna to keep him in line . That was not easy , and when he was 21 , Mickey took his first wife , an unknown actress named Ava Gardner , 19 . <P> They were divorced two years later .
