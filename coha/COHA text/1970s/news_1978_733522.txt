txt The Carter Administration believes that President Sadat will sign a peace treaty with Israel provided that Israel holds out the promise of similar terms to its other neighbors  --  territory in exchange for peace and security . Washington reckons that this would satisfy the Egyptian leader 's need to obtain something for all the Arab parties ; he would then feel free to proceed with what amounts to a separate settlement while urging Jordan and Syria to negotiate on the same basis whenever they choose . These American calculations could be wrong . But they inise from a fair reading of Mr. Sadat 's predicament . They could be teste  --  without damage to Israel 's security , as judged by Israel 's former leaders and several in the present Cabinet . Yet Prime Minister Begin seems to shrink from the test , risking instead a further erosion of support in the United States . The impression is spreading that Mr. Begin , contrary to his predecessors , is holding out not just for guarantees of security but for unrelated claims on territory . Considerable tension is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carter next week . To relieve it , the Israeli leader seems to be planning some new concessions to American sensibilities . There are encouraging signs that he will halt the creation of civilian settlements in the disputed West Bank . And if given more planes than Mr. Carter first proposed , Mr. Begin may even acquiesce in the simultaneous sale of jet fighters to Egypt and Saudi Arabia . But the idea that he is the occupier rather than liberator of the West Bank  --  Judea and Samaria , he calls it  --  seems to stick in his throat . ? The Israelis contend , with good reason , that they have gone very far to reciprocate Mr. Sadat 's recognition of their legitimacy in the Middle East . They have acknowledged Egypt 's sovereignty over the entire Sinaind Will return it , in stages , subject to security arran ments at sensitive points . They have also recognized Mr. Sadat 's need to gain something for his fellow Arabs ; they offer a declaration that Palestinians in the West Bank shall have , if not " self-determination , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And without conceding Jordan 's sovereignty over any portion of the West Bank , they offer to discuss territorial arrangements if only King Hussein joins the talks . These offers are not insignificant , as some have charged . Indeed , they have caused Mr. Begin some difficulty on his domestic right flank . But Mr. Sadat wants and probably needs more before he will agree to make his own treaty . He has sought a commitment that Israel will eventually withdraw to the pre-war lines of 1967 to meet his obligation to the Arabs who condemned his solo diplomacy . The Israelis Maintain that they can not return to those lines on their eastern front and that King Hussein can not have his sovereignty defined there before he enters into negotiations . After his recent talks with Mr. Sadat , President Carter concluded that the Egyptian would settle for a much looser formulation which , in fact , all previous Israeli Governments had accepted . He thinks it would suffice for Israel to reassert that the territory-for-peace formula of United Nations Resolution 242 , adopted after the 1967 war , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negotiations with Jordan and Syria as well as with Egypt . The Arabs always argued that 242 meant withdrawal from all territory ; the Americans said most ; the Israelis said some . Only Mr. Begin argued that on the West Bank it might mean none ; he seems to mean it still . ? There is a technical basis for the Begin position : No nation has an unambiguous claim to sovereignty in the West Bank . But it is a position of historical bad faith and tactical folly . No one expects an Israeli military withdrawal from the West Bank strongpoints in the foreseeable future . Hardly anyone denies that Israel requires some alterations in the precarious 1967 lines before they could become borders . Even Mr. Sadat envisions a five-year interim agreement , leaving the frontiers to be determined and the Israeli Army in effective command of the entire region . The hope is that coexistence could evolve there toward a Tinal settlement ; nothing could be settled without Israel 's agreement . The issue is whether eventuall3f , given peace and security guarantees , Israel would yield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether it would go on claiming total or joint ownership .. The irony here is that by failing to uphold 242 in the West Bank , Israel would be surrendering its other , hard-won principles . The resolution requires Israel to negotiate with only those Arabs who abandon all belligerency and claims on its territory  --  and not with , the Palestine Liberation Organization and others who still deny its legitimacy . ? It seems incomprehensible that the dream of permanent rule in Judea and Samaria should take precedence over a historic opportunity to make a true peace with Israel 's foremost adversary , to gain the recognition of the more conservative , most important Arab nations and to secure a protective American influence throughout the area . American affection for Israel runs very deep and the United States commitment to the defense of Israel 's heartland remains secure . But Israel 's friends in the United States owe it a timely warning of the disenchantment that could flow from Prime Minister Begin 's present stance .               @ @ @ @ @ @
