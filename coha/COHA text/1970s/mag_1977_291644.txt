CERTAIN PEOPLE : AMERICA 'S BLACK ELITE <P> by STEPHEN BIRMINGHAM <P> 301 pages . Little , Brown . $8.95 . <P> In his latest social history , Stephen Birmingham does for the black rich what he did for the Irish rich in Real Lace , the Jewish rich in Our Crowd , and the Wasp rich in The Right People . With a raconteur 's ear for a good anecdote and an interior decorator 's eye for a well-placed objet d'art , he classifies the values of the wealthy blacks , their habits , schools , clubs , skin tones , accents , charities and floor plans . <P> We learn , for instance , that the Chicago apartment of Ebony Publisher John H. Johnson has walls of leather , floors of petrified wood and a Jacuzzi whirlpool in every bathroom . Such ostentation , we are told , is frowned upon by the black old guard , who prefer the quiet good taste of Sag Harbor summer houses and Episcopal church services . That the black rich unbridgeably divide themselves into old and new money seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in such matters - whether real or feigned-quickly becomes cloying . After ten years of traveling among a growing list of ethnic elites , he has little excuse for such a lack of insight into the phenomena he purports to study . <P> Agile Hands . Indeed , Certain People is so flawed that it is hard to decide where to find fault first-in Birmingham 's cavalier disregard for documentation or in the complacent banality of his observations . For example , he traces the current class distinctions among blacks to the old divisions between house slaves and field slaves , then peremptorily concludes that the reason why blacks rarely succeed in business is that " they do n't quite like each other . " In a later chapter , he notes that blacks do make skilled surgeons , perhaps , he adds , " because they have especially deft and agile hands . " <P> Birmingham 's coup de grce , however , is a chapter called " Taste . " He takes up what he calls " the complicated question of black taste , or perhaps , lack of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . " Why , puzzles Birmingham , should the aristocratic wife of Washington 's black mayor " satisfy herself with plastic plants in her house and settle for brightly colored glass ceiling fixtures " ? Why does a Harlem socialite place a huge Steuben glass bowl in the center of her coffee table and fill it with gold-painted walnuts ? Why , he asks , do so many blacks drink Kool-Aid and smoke Kool cigarettes ? Birmingham 's answers are even more idiosyncratic than his questions . He theorizes that " the associations of the words Kool and cool , as in ' keeping one 's cool ' and ' playing it cool , ' have much to do with this . " But progress , at least Birmingham 's notion of it , is at hand ; he has noticed that more upwardly mobile blacks are now " es-chewing Cadillacs in favor of compacts and station wagons .
