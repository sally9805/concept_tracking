They wold make me believe that the moon was made of greene cheese . <P> -A Pistle to the Christian Reader , John Frith ( 1529 ) <P> Once man had finally stepped onto dusty lunar soil , scientists thought that they would easily be able to dispel all mysteries about the moon 's composition . Alas , not so . Both seismic tests on the moon 's surface and experiments on earth have shown that lunar material transmits sound at a perplexingly slower rate than ordinary terrestrial rocks . <P> Investigating the puzzle , two scientists at Columbia University 's Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory checked what they drily called " much earlier speculations concerning the nature of the moon . " Geophysicists Edward Schreiber and Orson L. Anderson carefully compared the sound-conducting properties of two lunar rocks with those of a wide assortment of cheeses . The result : Wisconsin muenster conveyed sound slightly faster than one moon rock ; Norwegian goat cheese responded almost precisely like the other rock . <P> Reporting their playful experiment , Schreiber and Anderson prudently make no claims of having solved the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work " leads us to suspect that perhaps old hypotheses are best , after all , and should not be lightly discarded .
