In the rough-and-tumble aircraft industry , where fortunes are made and lost on Government contracts , Lockheed has taken more than its share of tumbles . Over the years , it rolled up $480 million in losses on four military projects . In February , already cash-starved , it ran into even more trouble on its biggest venture into commercial aircraft : the L-1011 TriStar airbus . Rolls-Royce , supplier of engines for the TriStar , went into receivership and the British government refused to finance production of the engines unless the U.S. Government assured it that Lockheed could pay for them . <P> Now , provided Congress is amenable , Lockheed and its chairman , Daniel Haughton , may have that assurance . Treasury Secretary John Connally announced that the Administration this week will ask Congress for $250 million in a loan guarantee to keep the TriStar project going . The new loans would come from private banks , but would have Government backing and would be as secure as Federal Reserve notes . If Congress goes along , the British are expected to let Rolls-Royce proceed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed specifically for the TriStar air frame . Then 10,000 Lockheed employees working on the TriStar and 14,000 other workers at more than a thousand domestic subcontractors can stop worrying about their jobs . <P> Corner Grocer . But opposition to the bail-out plan is already forming in Congress , where approval is necessary before the money actually starts flowing . " I will do my best as a Senator to oppose this proposal , " said William Proxmire , who figured heavily in the defeat of the SST . House Banking Committee Chairman Wright Patman , who helped defeat the Administration 's initial loan proposal to save Penn Central from bankruptcy last year , also has his knife out . Others are opposed to the rescue plan unless , as Indiana 's Vance Hartke says , " the corner grocer gets one too . " <P> Mindful of Congress 's testiness , Secretary Connally is touching every responsive chord he can reach in his defense of the loan guarantee : jobs , defense , national pride , Anglo-American relations and the future of technology . " We think the price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely justifies this action , " he said last week . " Besides , we 're gon na have the additional collateral of getting our money out first . " One of Connally 's biggest selling points is that , unlike the final Penn Central rescue proposal , Government-backed loans to Lockheed will be paid off before the company 's other $400 million in outstanding loans . <P> If the Administration bill is defeated in Congress-or even stalled past the Labor Day recess-the TriStar project may well be doomed . And if TriStar dies , Lockheed executives fear , the company itself has no chance of survival .
