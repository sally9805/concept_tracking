txt 200 Some Specific Societal Problems and Response to Those Problems is a lie . I 'm not for wanton violence , I 'm for justice . I feel that if white people were attacked by Negroes ? if the forces of law prove unable , or inadequate , or reluctant to protect those whites from those Negroes ? then those white people should protect and defend themselves from those Negroes , using arms if necessary . And I feel that when the law fails to protect Negroes from whites ' attack , then those Negroes should use arms , if necessary , to defend themselves . " " Malcolm X Advocates Armed Negroes ! " What was wrong with that ? I 'll tell you what was wrong . I was a black man talking about physical defense against the white man . The white man can lynch and burn and bomb and beat Negroes ? that 's all right : " Have patience " . . . " The customs are entrenched " . . . " Things are getting better . " Well , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brutalized to continue to accept that brutality without doing something to defend himself . If that 's how " Christian " philosophy is interpreted , if that 's what Gandhian philosophy teaches , well , then , I will call them criminal philosophies . I tried in every speech I made to clarify my new position regarding white people ? " I do n't speak against the sincere , well-meaning , good white people . I have learned that there are some . I have learned that not all white people are racists . I am speaking against and my right is against the white racists . I firmly believe that Negroes have the right to fight against these racists , by any means that are necessary . " But the white reporters kept wanting me linked with that word " violence . " I doubt if I had one interview without having to deal with that accusation . " I am for violence if non-violence means we continue postponing a solution to the American black man 's problem ? just to avoid violence . I do n't go for nonviolence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a delayed solution is a non-solution . Or I 'll say it another way . If it must take violence to get the black man his human rights in this country , I 'm for violence exactly as you know the Irish , the Poles , or Jews would be if they were flagrantly discriminated against . I am just as they would be in that case , and they would be for violence ? no matter what the consequences , no matter who was hurt by the violence . " White society hates to hear anybody , especially a black man , talk about the crime the white man has perpetrated on the black man . I have always understood that 's why I have been so frequently called " a revolutionist . " It sounds as ff. ( have done some crime ! Well , it may be the American black man does need to become involved in a real revolution . The word for " revolution " in German is Umwalzung . What it means is a complete overturn ? a complete change . The overthrow of King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an example of a true revolution . It means the destroying of an old system , and its replacement with a new system . Another example is the Algerian revolution , led by Ben Bella ; they threw out the French who had been there over 100 years . So how does anybody Human Injustice 201 sound talking about the Negro in America waging some " revolution " ? Yes , he is condemning a system ? but he 's not trying to overturn the system , or to destroy it . The Negro 's so-called " revolt " is merely an asking to be accepted into the existing system ! A true Negro revolt might entail , for instance , fighting for separate black states within this country ? which several groups and individuals have advocated , long before Elijah Muhammad came along . When the white man came into this country , he certainly was n't demonstrating any " non-violence . " In fact , the very man whose name symbolizes non-violence here today has stated : " Our nation was born in genocide when it embraced the doctrine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inferior race . Even before there were large numbers of Negroes on our shores , the scar of racial hatred had already disfigured colonial society . From the sixteenth century forward , blood flowed in battles over racial supremacy . We are perhaps the only nation which tried as a matter of national policy to wipe out its indigenous population . Moreover , we elevated that tragic experience into a noble crusade . Indeed , even today we have not permitted ourselves to reject or to feel remorse for this shameful episode . Our literature , our films , our drama , our folklore all exalt it . Our children are still taught to respect the violence which reduced a red-skinned people of an earlier culture into a few fragmented groups herded into impoverished reservations . " " Peaceful coexistence ! " That 's another one the white man has always been quick to cry . Fine ! But what have been the deeds of the white man ? During his entire advance through history , he has been waving the banner of Christianity .. . and carrying in his other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be presently constituted , with its hierarchy , was conceived in Africa ? by those whom the Christian church calls " The Desert Fathers . " The Christian church became infected with racism when it entered white Europe . The Christian church returned to Africa under the banner of the Cross ? conquering , killing , exploiting , pillaging , raping , bullying , beating ? and teaching white supremacy . This is how the white man thrust himself into the position of leadership of the world ? through the use of naked physical power . And he was totally inadequate spiritually . Mankind 's history has proved from one era to another that the true criterion of leadership is spiritual . Men are attracted by spirit . By power , men are forced . Love is engendered by spirit . By power , anxieties are created . I am in agreement one hundred per cent with those racists who say that no government laws ever can force brotherhood . The only true world solution today is governments guided by true religion ? of the spirit . Here in race-torn America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed , particularly by the American black man . The black man needs to reflect that he has been America 's 202 Some Specific Societal Problems and Response to Those Problems most fervent Christian ? and where has it gotten him ? In fact , in the white man 's hands , in the white man 's interpretation . . . where has Christianity brought this world ? A desegregated cup of coffee , a theater , public toilets ? the whole range of hypocritical " integration " ? these are not atonement . An American white ambassador in one African country was Africa 's most respected American ambassador : I 'm glad to say that this was told to me by one ranking African leader . We talked for an entire afternoon . Based on what I had heard of him , I had to believe him when he told me that as long as he was on the African continent , he never thought in terms of race , that he dealt with human beings , never noticing their color . He said he was more aware of language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he returned to America would he become aware of color differences . I told him , " What you are telling me is that it is n't the American white man who is a racist , but it 's the American political , economic , and social atmosphere that automatically nourishes a racist psychology in the white man . " He agreed . We both agreed that American society makes it next to impossible for humans to meet in America and not be conscious of their color differences . And we both agreed that if racism could be removed , America could offer a society where rich and poor could truly live like human beings . That discussion with the ambassador gave me a new insight ? one which I like : that the white man is not inherently evil , but America 's racist society influences him to act evilly . The society has produced and nourishes a psychology which brings out the lowest , most base part of human beings . Politics dominated the American scene while I was traveling abroad this time . In Cairo and again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with transAtlantic calls , asking whom did I favor , Johnson ? or Goldwater ? I said I felt that as far as the American black man was concerned they were both just about the same . I felt that it was for the black man only a question of Johnson , the fox , or Goldwater , the wolf . " Conservatism " in America 's politics means " Let 's keep the niggers in their place . " And " liberalism " means " Let 's keep the knee-grows in their place ? but tell them we 'll treat them a little better ; let 's fool them more , with more promises . " With these choices , I felt that the American black man only needed to choose which one to be eaten by , the " liberal " fox or the " conservative " wolf ? because both of them would eat him . I kept having all kinds of troubles trying to develop the kind of Black Nationalist organization I wanted to build for the American Negro . Why Black Nationalism ? Well , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any white-black solidarity before there is first some black solidarity ? If you will remember , in my childhood I had been exposed to the Black Nationalist teachings of Marcus Human Injustice 203 Garvey ? which , in fact , I had been told had led to my father 's murder . Even when I was a follower of Elijah Muhammad , I had been strongly aware of how the Black Nationalist political , economic and social philosophies had the ability to instill within black men the racial dignity , the incentive , and the confidence that the black race needs today to get up off its knees , and to get on its feet , and get rid of its scars , and to take a stand for itself . One of the major troubles that I was having in building the organization that I wanted ? an all black organization whose ultimate objective was to help create a society in which there could exist honest white-black brotherhood ? was that my earlier public image , my old so-called " Black Muslim " image , kept blocking me . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to turn a corner , into a new regard by the public , especially Negroes ; I was no less angry than I had been , but at the same time the true brotherhood I had seen in the Holy World had influenced me to recognize that anger can blind human vision . Every free moment I could find , I did a lot of talking to key people whom I knew around Harlem , and I made a lot of speeches , saying : " True Islam taught me that it takes all of the religious , political , economic , psychological , and racial ingredients , or characteristics , to make the Human Family and the Human Society complete . " Since I learned the truth in Mecca , my dearest friends have come to include all kinds ? some Christians , Jews , Buddhists , Hindus , agnostics , and even atheists ! I have friends who are called capitalists , Socialists , and Communists ! Some of my friends are moderates , conservatives , extremists ? some are even Uncle Toms ! My friends today are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " I said to Harlem street audiences that only when mankind would submit to the One God who created all ? only then would mankind even approach the " peace " of which so much talk could be heard . . . but toward which so little action was seen . I said that on the American racial level , we had to approach the black man 's struggle against the white man 's racism as a human problem , that we had to forget hypocritical politics and propaganda . I said that both races , as human beings , had the obligation , the responsibility , of helping to correct America 's human problem . The well-meaning white people , I said , had to combat , actively and directly , the racism in other white people . And the black people had to build within themselves much greater awareness that along with equal rights there had to be the bearing of equal responsibilities . I knew , better than most Negroes , how many white people truly wanted to see American racial problems solved . I knew that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bet I got fifty letters some days from white people . The white people in meeting audiences would throng around me , asking me , after I had addressed them somewhere , " What can a sincere white person do ? " When I say that here now , it makes me think about that little co-ed I told you about , the one who flew from her New England college down to New York and 204 Some Specific Societal Problems and Response to Those Problems came up to me in the Nation of Islam 's restaurant in Harlem , and I told her that there was " nothing " she could do . I regret that I told her that . I wish that now I knew her name , or where I could telephone her , or write to her , and tell her what I tell white people now when they present themselves as being sincere , and ask me , one way or another , the same thing that she asked . The first thing I tell them is that at least where my own particular Black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerned , they ca n't join us . I have these very deep feelings that white people who want to join black organizations are really just taking the escapist way to salve their consciences . By visibly hovering near us , they are " proving " that they are " with us . " But the hard truth is this is n't helping to solve America 's racist problem . The Negroes are n't the racists . Where the really sincere white people have got to do their " proving " of themselves is not among the black victims , but out on the battle lines of where America 's racism really is ? and that 's in their own home communities ; America 's racism is among their own fellow whites . That 's where the sincere whites who really mean to accomplish something have got to work . Aside from that , I mean nothing against any sincere whites when I say that as members of black organizations , generally whites ' very presence subtly renders the black organization automatically less effective . Even the best white members will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do , and particularly of what they can do ? for themselves , working by themselves , among their own kind , in their own communities . I sure do n't want to hurt anybody 's feelings , but in fact I 'll even go so far as to say that I never really trust the kind of white people who are always so anxious to hang around Negroes , or to hang around in Negro communities . I do n't trust the kind of whites who love having Negroes always hanging around them . I do n't know ? this feeling may be a throwback to the years when I was hustling in Harlem and all of those red-faced , drunk whites in the afterhours clubs were always grabbing hold of some Negroes and talking about " I just want you to know you 're just as good as I am ? " And then they got back in their taxicabs and black limousines and went back downtown to the places where they lived and worked , where no blacks except servants had better get caught . But , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a black organization , you watch , pretty soon the blacks will be leaning on the whites to support it , and before you know it a black may be up front with a title , but the whites , because of their money , are the real controllers . I tell sincere white people , " Work in conjunction with us ? each of us working among our own kind . " Let sincere white individuals find all other white people they can who feel as they do ? and let them form their own all-white groups , to work trying to convert other white people who are thinking and acting so racist . Let sincere whites go and teach nonviolence to white people ! Sometimes , I have dared to dream to myself that one day , history may even say that my voice ? which disturbed the white man 's smugness , and his arrogance , and Human Injustice 205 his complacency ? that my voice helped to save America from a grave , possibly even a fatal catastrophe . The goal has always been the same , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Martin Luther King 's nonviolent marching , that dramatizes the brutality and the evil of the white man against defenseless blacks . And in the racial climate of this country today , it is anybody 's guess which of the " extremes " in approach to the black man 's problems might personally meet a fatal catastrophe first ? " nonviolent " Dr. King , or so-called " violent " me . I know , too , that I could suddenly die at the hands of some white racists . Or I could die at the hands of some Negro hired by the white man . Or it could be some brainwashed Negro acting on his own idea that by eliminating me he would be helping out the white man , because I talk about the white man the way I do . Anyway , now , each day I live as if I am already dead , and I tell you what I would like for you to do . When I am dead ? I say it that way because from the things I know , I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its finished form ? I want you to just watch and see if I 'm not right in what I say : that the white man , in his press , is going to identify me with " hate . " He will make use of me dead , as he has made use of me alive , as a convenient symbol of " hatred " ? and that will help him to escape facing the truth that all I have been doing is holding up a mirror to reflect , to show , the history of unspeakable crimes that his race has committed against my race . You watch . I will be labeled as , at best , an " irresponsible " black man . I have always felt about this accusation that the black " leader " whom white men consider to be " responsible " is invariably the black " leader " who never gets any results . You only get action as a black man if you are regarded by the white man as " irresponsible . " In fact , this much I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since I have been some kind of a " leader " of black people here in the racist society of America , I have been more reassured each time the white man resisted me , or attacked me harder ? because each time made me more certain that I was on the right track in the American black man 's best interests . The racist white man 's opposition automatically made me know that I did offer the black man something worthwhile . Yes , I have cherished my " demagogue " role . I know that societies often have killed the people who have helped to change those societies . And if I can die having brought any light , having exposed any meaningful truth that will help to destroy the racist cancer that is malignant in the body of America ? then , all of the credit is due to Allah . Only the mistakes have been mine . The summer of 1967 again brought racial disorders to American cities , and with them shock , fear and bewilderment to the nation . The worst came during a two-week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Detroit . Each set off a chain reaction in neighboring communities . On July 28 , 1967 , the President of the United States established this Commission and directed us to answer three basic questions : What happened ? Why did it happen ? What can be done to prevent it from happening again ? To respond to these questions , we have undertaken a broad range of studies and investigations . We have visited the riot cities ; we have heard many witnesses ; we have sought the counsel of experts across the country . This is our basic conclusion : Our nation is moving toward two societies , one black , one white ? separate and unequal . Reaction to last summer 's disorders has quickened the movement and deepened the division . Discrimination and segregation have long permeated much of American life ; they now threaten the future of every American . 206 Human Injustice 207 This deepening racial division is not inevitable . The movement apart can be reversed . Choice is still possible . Our principal task is to define that choice and to press for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involve the continuing polarization of the American community and , ultimately , the destruction of basic democratic values . The alternative is not blind repression or capitulation to lawlessness . It is the realization of common opportunities for all within a single society . This alternative will require a commitment to national action ? compassionate , massive and sustained , backed by the resources of the most powerful and the richest nation on this earth . From every American it will require new attitudes , new understanding , and , above all , new will . The vital needs of the nation must be met ; hard choices must be made , and , if necessary , new taxes enacted . Violence can not build a better society . Disruption and disorder nourish repression , not justice . They strike at the freedom of every citizen . The community can not ? it will not ? tolerate coercion and mob rule . Violence and destruction must be ended ? in the streets of the ghetto and in the lives of people . Segregation and poverty have created in the racial ghetto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What white Americans have never fully understood ? but what the Negro can never forget ? is that white society is deeply implicated in the ghetto . White institutions created it , white institutions maintain it , and white society condones it . It is time now to turn with all the purpose at our command to the major unfinished business of this nation . It is time to adopt strategies for action that will produce quick and visible progress . It is time to make good the promises of American democracy to all citizens ? urban and rural , white and black , Spanishsurname , American Indian , and every minority group . Our recommendations embrace three basic principles : To mount programs on a scale equal to the dimension of the problems : To aim these programs for high impact in the immediate future in order to close the gap between promise and performance ; To undertake new initiatives and experiments that can change the system of failure and frustration that now dominates the ghetto and weakens our society . One of the first witnesses to be invited to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a distinguished and perceptive scholar . Referring to the reports of earlier riot commissions , he said : I react that report ... of the 1919 riot in Chicago , and it is as if I were reading the tepott of the investigating committee on the Harlem riot of ' 35 , the report 208 Some Specific Societal Problems and Response to Those Problems of the investigating committee on the Harlem riot of ' 43 , the report of the McCone Commission on the Watts riot . I must again in candor say to you members of this Commission ? it is a kind of Alice in Wonderland ? with the same moving picutre re-shown over and over again , the same analysis , the same recommendations , and the same inaction . These words come to our minds as we conclude this Report . We have provided an honest beginning . We have learned much . But we have uncovered no startling truths , no unique insights , no simple solutions . The destruction and the bitterness of racial disorder , the harsh polemics of black revolt and white repression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is time now to end the destruction and the violence , not only in the streets of the ghetto but in the lives of people . Bait Advertising and the Switch Sale A sizable number of the families had been victimized by " bait " advertising . Responding to advertisements for sewing machines , phonographs , washing machines , and other items offered at unusually low prices , they succumbed to the salesmen 's " switch-sale " technique by buying a much more expensive model . The technique is illustrated by the story of a 26-year-old Negro housewife : I saw a TV ad for a $29 sewing machine , so I wrote to the company and they sent down a salesman who demonstrated it for me . It shook the whole house , but I wanted to buy it anyway . But he kept saying it would disturb all the neighbors by being so noisy , and went out to the hall and brought in another model costing $185 ... . I actually had to pay $220 . He promised if I paid within a certain amount of time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was out of work , we could n't pay within the time period , so I did n't get the refund . . . . I was taken in by the high-pressure sales talk . A middle-aged Puerto Rican husband was victimized by a variant of this racket . Instead of responding to an ad , he received a call from a salesman saying that his 209 210 Some Specific Societal Problems and Response to Those Problems wife had won a sewing machine : He brought the machine to the house . It was worth $25 , and we ended up buying another one for $186 . A friend of mine bought a similar machine , maybe better than mine , for $90 . They tricked me into buying the machine for $186 on credit ... . Another variant of the " something for nothing " appeal is based on the principle of the " pyramid club . " Consumers are promised a refund if they help the salesman find a certain number of customers . One instance , reported by an 18-year-old Negro housewife , involved the added inducement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleaner salesman here . He said that he would give me $5 just to talk to me . Then he said that if I got him nine more sales I could have the vacuum cleaner free . I was n't able to find any customers and I ca n't work the vacuum cleaner with all its attachments . I do n't want it and I 've stopped making the payments on it . Here we see an example of the great disparity between the more traditional logic of these consumers and the law of installment buying . Whether or not the consumer wants the merchandise has no bearing on the merchant 's right to payment once the contract is signed . Misrepresentation of Prices The preceding incidents illustrate various schemes through which low-income families are pressured into buying . Other incidents exhibit another fairly common form of duplicity : the misrepresentation of price particularly in credit transactions . Although the merchant is required by law in New York State to enter both the cash price and the finance charges on the installment contract , some circumvent this law either by not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the customer his copy of the contract until some time after the sale is consummated . In several instances we found that the consumer did not learn the full cost of his merchandise until he received the payment coupons some time after the sale . This practice is illustrated by the following typical episodes : 41-year-old Puerto Rican husband , welfare family I was cheated on a TV set I bought . At first the price was supposed to be $220 . After I signed the contract I found out that it was really $300 . But then it was too late . 34-year-old Puerto Rican housewife I was told by the salesman that the credit price for the Hi-Fi set was $299 . When I got the payment book , I found out that I had to pay them $347. 28-year-old Negro housewife I heard an ad on the radio about a special bargain on washing machines for only $100 . After I ordered it and had it installed , I got Human Injustice 211 a bill for $200 . I said I would n't pay it and they took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they never gave it back to me . I 'm just glad I did not have to pay the balance ... . Substitution of Goods Not only are prices misrepresented in the low income market , but so is quality . Some families were sold reconditioned merchandise that had been represented as new , and others received merchandise inferior to that ordered . The sale of used merchandise as new is of course illegal . Yet some merchants hinted that their competitors engaged in this practice . The following reports indicate that this does indeed happen . A 36-year-old Puerto Rican mother on welfare gave this account : I bought a TV set from a First Avenue store . It was a used set which was sold as new . After seven days it broke down . The store took it back and returned it in two weeks . It broke down again and they took it for thirty days . They brought it back and it broke down one week later . They took it away again and I asked for a refund because there was a guarantee of ninety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't give me back my $100 or bring me another TV . I went to the store several times but with no results ... . The Anonymity of Credit Transactions Several families responded to the question about cheating by describing pots-andpans salesmen who sold them poor-quality merchandise at exorbitant prices . The details of these stories are similar . The salesman shows up either with the goods or with a catalogue . He stresses the unusually low payments , gets the housewife to sign a contract , extracts a small down-payment , and then disappears . Sometime later the family receives a payment book from a finance company and frequently learns only then that the set of pots and pans will cost as much as $60 . What is striking about these accounts is the anonymity of the transaction . Several interviewees reported that they tried unsuccessfully to find out the name of the store from which they had bought the merchandise . The high-pressure techniques of these salesmen as well as the theme of anonymity are illustrated in this report by a 30-year-old Puerto Rican husband : This happened about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife was home and a man knocked at the door . He was selling pots and he pressured my wife to look at them . He said that they would cost only $5 a month and that he would leave her a piggy bank so she could save for other things . Then he told her to " sign here , " and when all the payments were made she 'd get a present . He then 212 Some Specific Societal Problems and Response to Those Problems asked her if he could just leave the pots for a second while he went downstairs . But since she was signed up he never came back . We got a coupon book and mailed $5 each month to a bank in New Jersey . . . . I do n't know the name of the store but I guess it 's somewhere in Fen way , New Jersey . I have no records of it . Another young Puerto Rican husband gave a similar account : A salesman came around selling aluminum pots and pans . They 're not worth a damn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent me a book and I had to send in payments . Some bank in New Jersey . I tried to find out the store 's name , but I could n't . The set cost $60 ? $5 a month for twelve months . These incidents illustrate the various ways in which merchants take advantage of low-income consumers . They show the high pressure tactics , the substitution of goods , the exorbitant prices and the shoddy merchandise that are commonplace in the low-income market . In 1939 , at the end of the Depression and before the United States was involved in World War II , surveys and investigations revealed that one-third of the people of the United States were " ill clothed , ill housed and ill fed . " The onset of World War II complicated the questions of housing and clothing but the national leadership recognized that an undernourished and malnourished population was a weak population , and set about to work to remedy this with the motto " America needs us strong . " A nationwide program was mounted , coordinated and inspired by Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States Department of Agriculture , providing for coordination among government agencies concerned with food production , food distribution , food research , and the health of children , expectant mothers , the men in the armed services and industrial workers . Advisory committees and boards of natural and social scientists were organized and financed . Nutritional committees were set up in every state , under the leadership of experienced home economists , competent in the details of choice and preparation of foods , budgeting and planning . The food industries and the vitamin manufacturers were involved in demonstration projects on the use of reinforced foods , greater consumption of milk and balanced diets . The mass media were systematically brought into the program ; radio , especially , became a continuing and potent force . 213 214 Some Specific Societal Problems and Response to Those Problems in promoting better use of foods . The rationing system was so related to regional supplies and regional preferences that it worked in spite of the complexities of size and diversity of the United States . Educational programs reached every level of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their appeals , a cause which no one could afford to be against . At the end of World War II enormous progress had been made . The people with the poorest diets , notably in the Southeast , were eating better than they ever had before ; reinforced foods were a commonplace throughout the country ; it was almost impossible to find a case of pellagra , once one of the characteristic deficiency diseases of the Southeast . Vitamin supplements were widespread . The idea of the seven basic foods developed as a framework for good nutrition had become a guide post in school lunches , group feeding and home planning . The affluence that followed World War II , with full employment , high wages and an abundance of available food made the picture seem even rosier . By the early 1950 's it was possible to say that America 's major nutritional problem was overnutrition . Attention shifted to the problems of overeating , and obscure clinical manifestation of malnutrition . Uneasy under the accusation that Americans were , in fact , overfed , when such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American attention turned resolutely away from the question of malnutrition in the United States . Almost the entire elaborate apparatus of research , education and monitoring of health and home practices disappeared . Where in the 1940 's the motive power for better food and better nutritional practices had come from within the Department of Agriculture , so that research and education interacted with programs designed to dispose of surplus commodities or promote the growth and sale of special products , by the 1960 's the centers within the U.S.D.A. , devoted to the care of the American people , had withered away . The Bureau of Home Economics was abolished . The Farm Security agency , once the center of concern for the subsistence farmer , shrank to a ghost of its former self . The Extension department became increasingly concerned with large scale commercial farming . In other agencies it was the same story . Funds once available for nutrition education in high schools were diverted to physical education . In the universities , nutrition departments turned away from the needs of hungry and undernourished people to bio-chemical research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so often do , we had made a great effort , had great success , and then we completely lost interest . Meanwhile , mechanization drove people by the thousands from the unproductive farms into the cities . Those who were left behind and those who migrated fell into deep poverty . The programs once operated in close relationship to the leadership of nutritionists and home economists were now sporadically deployed in response to positive and negative political pressures over the country . School lunches and stamp plans and surplus commodities ceased to be answers to growing Human Injustice 215 hunger and extensive malnutrition . Deficiency diseases and the consequences of malnutrition , a high infant death rate , failure to learn in school , began to appear more and more frequently . But there was no adequate research , no national leadership , hardly any local programs to deal with the growing problems . It is now estimated that we have almost 10,000,000 Americans who are malnourished , and undernourished , and that many of these are on the edge of slow starvation . Thirty years ago , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tackle the sorry condition of a third of the nation . Today we seem unable to deal with a twentieth of the nation , in spite of our greatly increased productivity and far greater technical resources . This has all been lost sight of in the local contests that have gone on in poor counties where the agricultural workers who are no longer needed are being starved out ; in the towns and cities where the distributing methods make it intolerably difficult for those in need to use the various federal distribution plans ; in the failure of health authorities to recognize nutritional disease ? somehow the central issue that people are hungry and sick from malnutrition , that infants and children are being irreversibly damaged , that foods are being synthesized and alloyed in ways dangerous to health has been forgotten . We need to start over , clear the decks of the accumulated petty attacks and counterattacks within and against the agricultural establishment , which is now too devoted to the production end to be a fitting center for a food and nutrition program that is concerned with people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts : the American people are less well nourished , as a whole , than they were 10 years ago . Those with the fewest resources and least education , those who live in the worst areas and belong to the most disadvantaged groups , are suffering the most . Their need is urgent . The national need is urgent . Evidence is accumulating of the irreversible damage that is done to the mental ability of children who are malnourished . Our future depends upon the capacities of our people to manage a highly technological and demanding society . The problem of meeting the food and nutrition needs of the American people is not a production problem . We do not live , as people of many other nations do , on the edge of genuine scarcity . Nor is it a problem of transportation , as in China . Nor is it a problem of profiteering in times of scarcity as in some Asian countries . Our problem is one of distribution alone , how to see that the necessary food , containing , either naturally or by supplementation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whatever their age or sex , their economic status , their race or their location . We need to be sure that the right kind of food , in the right quantities , is available to the people who need it , and that they have the means to buy it , the knowledge of what to choose and how to plan and prepare it . We knew how to do all of these things in 1945 ; it would take a relatively short time to learn how to do them now . 216 Some Specific Societal Problems and Response to Those Problems During these dismal years when our people have grown worse nourished , and hungrier and when research on people 's habits and people 's needs has all but ground to a halt , there has been one set of advances ? in our knowledge and ability to supplement and fortify foods in ways that will produce optimum nutritional effects and optimum acceptability . Experience of food supplementation and fortification has demonstrated that the route to a better nourished population is by way of commercially available nutritious products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that they are available to those who need them . Properly distributed foods , reinforced and fortified to meet special situations , locally deficient diets , poor food habits , unbalanced supplies in federal distribution plans , school lunches which bear a disproportionate nutritional load , must be combined with money enough to buy them if this threat of malnutrition is to be removed . We need a national food and nutrition program now . The 81st Congress passed the National Housing Act of 1949 , calling for " the realization as soon as feasible of the goal of a decent home and a suitable living environment for every American family . " In August the 90th Congress in its Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 reaffirmed this historic national housing goal but found it " has not been fully realized for many of the nation 's lower income families . " A study of this Committee estimated the current number of " lower-income families " for whom a " decent home " is still unaffordable ( the " noneffective demand " in the U.S. housing market ) : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? can not now afford to pay the market price for standard housing that would cost no more than 20 percent of their total incomes . ( The average ratio of housing costs to gross income for the total population is 15 percent . ) About half of these 7.8 million families are surviving on less that $3,000 a year ? the Federal poverty level . The study projected the size of this gap 10 years from now , assuming no marked changes in current economic trends , national policies and priorities among Federal 21 7 218 Some Specific Societal Problems and Response to Those Problems programs . The projection showed that the prevalence of poverty can be expected to decline only slightly : In 1978 , about 7.5 million families ? 1 in every 10 ? would still be unable to afford standard housing ... . Characteristics of House-Poor Families Taking the 1960 U.S. Census and other available data as sources , TEMPO 's study group projected the demographic characteristics of 1978 's families lacking sufficient income to afford standard housing : About 70 percent will be white . About @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared to 1 in 12 white families . About half the nonwhite families will be living in the nation 's central cities . According to 1960 census statistics , nonwhites ? regardless of income ? must earn one-third more than whites in order to afford standard housing ( based on allocation of 20 percent of earnings for mortgage payments or rent ) . After projecting the characteristics of age and family size , TEMPO estimated these conclusions : Among the urban white families too poor to afford decent housing in 1978 , about half will be elderly ( head of the household 65-years-old or more ) . Among nonwhite urban families needing housing assistance , only 27 percent will be elderly . Among needy urban white families , about 70 percent will be small households of one or two persons . Among nonwhite families , only 43 percent will consist of one or two persons . Housing Conditions in the United States TEMPO 's estimates of the characteristics and conditions of the nation 's total housing inventory suggest a fuller picture . There are about 66 million housing units and 60 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough rooftops : An estimated 6.7 million occupied units are substandard dwellings ? 4 million lacking indoor plumbing and 2.7 million in dilapidated condition . 6.1 million units ( both standard and substandard ) are overcrowded with more than one person per room . Among the six million vacant units , only about two million are in standard condition and available for occupancy ? the nation 's lowest available vacancy rate since 1958 . Human Injustice 219 These estimates suggest a growing shortage of decent housing , not only for lower-income families but for the entire population . TEMPO 's projections bear out this assumption . In order to provide enough standard housing for the entire population by 1978 , TEMPO estimates the American economy will need to : Build 13.4 million units for new , young families forming during the decade ahead . Replace or rehabilitate 8.7 million units that will deteriorate into substandard conditions . Replace three million standard units that will be either accidentally destroyed or purposefully demolished for non-residential land reuses . Build 1.6 million units to allow for enough vacancies for our increasingly mobile population . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's housing needs , this Committee reached a fundamental conclusion : there are two distinct and definable but inseparably interdependent housing problems : There is an immediate and critical social need for millions of decent dwellings to shelter the nation 's lower-income families . Overlying this need is one raising an unprecedented and challenging production problem . The nation is heading toward a serious shortage of housing for the total population , unless production is sharply increased . These two problems ? housing needs of the poor and total national housing needs ? are parts of the same equation . They must be tackled together . So long as there is a severe shortage of housing among all income levels , the goal of meeting the housing needs of the poor will not only be more difficult but in this Committee 's judgment , it is also unlikely that it will be politically , socially and economically attainable . We recommended that the nation commit itself to a goal of producing at least 26 million new and rehabilitated housing units by 1978 , including six to eight million Federally subsidized dwellings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Housing Market and Public Policies Americans spend about $50 billion a year to buy , rent , and maintain our dwellings , and about another $50 billion on utilities , furniture , and other housing expenses . Residential land and structures represent about a third of our total national wealth . More than a quarter of new annual capital investment goes into all the elements that constitute the broadly defined housing industry . Yet more than 12 percent of American families can not afford decent housing and at least 10 percent of the nation 's existing shelters are in substandard 220 Some Specific Societal Problems and Response to Those Problems condition . This gap may imply some gross inefficiency in the American housing market . To the contrary , the Committee has found that such is not the case . When consumers create an effective demand , the U.S. homebuilding industry and housing market have proven their capabilities for producing a quality product and delivering it at reasonable prices . The staff 's comparative analyses of U.S. and foreign housing shows that the prevailing standards of American housing generally equal or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumer price indexes point up that housing and all other items , excepting sharply rising medical care costs , rose roughly in line from 1950 to 1960 , after which time all other consumer prices began climbing at a faster rate than housing costs . A chart prepared by the staff dissects the housing delivery process into four distinct phases : preparation , production , distribution and service . Each phase requires inputs from 6 to 14 different sources , from architects to zoning officials , and each operates within the constraints set up by 5 to 11 separate and different sources for impediments and restrictions . In total , there are 23 major public and private direct participants in the housing production process ( some involved in more than one phase ) and 17 major public and private sources for laws , rules and practices that restrict and influence the process practically every step of the way . The Committee concluded that within these sets of existing characteristics and constraints , housing producers operate with greater efficiency and response to innovations than commonly thought . The builder , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs . The following tables taken from a consultant 's report ( McGraw-Hill Information Systems ' Technical Report ) show the cost components in building and occupying housing , and demonstrate that the real costs for housing are spread among more ingredients than the cost for constructing the dwelling itself . After analyzing the work of our consultants and staff , the Committee reached these major conclusions regarding the cost of housing : Even with implementation of effective policies to squeeze out every practically attainable cost reduction , we can realistically expect a reduction in monthly housing costs of only about 10 percent in the foreseeable years ahead . Although a 10 percent reduction in consumer 's housing costs would save billions of dollars in resources annually , it would not be enough to bring new standard housing within economic reach of lower-income families . Private enterprise , alone , can not solve the nation 's problems of housing the poor . Federal housing assistance remains essential for lower-income families . Nixon 's Iron Curtain on the Cost of the War Nixon 's new budget takes secrecy in government two steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war in Vietnam and he has also blacked out it spending from his budgetary projections for the next four years . " A bu Nixon said in his message , " must be a blueprint for the future . " In his blu these two main parts are missing . " In the past , " Nixon said about his new fot projections , " the Federal government has been unwilling to pull all the together and present the results of projecting Government finances inl future . " He said this was essential for " an enlightened discussion of public p even though precise figures are , of course , impossible . " Why then omit expenc which eat up more than half the general revenues of the government ? About ten days before the budget was released the Pentagon information was still telling reporters that the cost of the war during the next fiscal year be about $17 billion . When Secretary Laird first gave out this figure last Oc he said this would mean a $13 billion saving over the $30 billion the war fiscal ' 69 , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense by function " ) were billion . But total military costs budgeted for fiscal ' 71 , instead of being $13 less than that ( or $68.2 billion ) are $73.5 billion , or only $7.7 billion less means that non-Vietnam military spending is up by $5.3 billion . This incrr non-Vietnam military spending is itself more than twice as large as total c 226 Some Specific Societal Problems and Response to Those Problems budgeted for natural resources ( $2.5 billion ) including air and water despite all Nixon 's " now or never " rhetoric on pollution . No Austerity On Strategic Arms This may understate the realities . Proxmire in a Senate speech Feb. 10 estimated that the Pentagon " has heisted $10 billion of the peace dividend . " He takes into account not only Laird 's predicted cut in Vietnam war costs but his announcement last Oct. 16 that henceforth the Pentagon would plan its level of forces for one major and one minor wars instead of two major and one minor wars as it has since the Kennedy-McNamara period . Proxmire said the money thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phase of the ABM , conversion of Polaris into the MIRVed Poseidon , on which the overruns are now $3 billion ; into MIRVed Minuteman III , where the overruns are also about $3 billion ; into the Navy , which is getting $2.6 billion to modernize the fleet , an increase of $1 billion over 1967-69 expenditures ; and into a huge AWACS , over-the-horizon warning system . " Some $18 billion has already been spent for SAGE and AWACS , " Proxmire said of these two anti-bomber systems , " even though the Russians have no modern intercontinental bomber . These huge funds were expended to meet a non-existent threat . " This is hardly austere military budgeting . This brings me to the related blackout the Nixon administration is imposing on military spending and planning . " We have learned , " Nixon said in the economic report , " that 1-year planning leads to almost as much confusion as no planning at all . " He said that was why he was opening up the books , and making long-range projects " that will enable the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a four year projection which shows , among other things , that Nixon 's new civilian initiatives including welfare and pollution will go up from $3 billion in the first year to $18 billion in the fourth . Yet there are no similar projections on the military side . How can Nixon say that he is making long-range 4-year projections available to " enable the people to discuss their choices more effectively " when the military side of these projections ? much the biggest single share ? is hidden from them ? " We must become increasingly aware , " Nixon also said in the Budget Message , " that small decisions today often lead to large cash outlays in the future . " Of no part of the budget is this more resoundingly true than the military sector . A speech by Congressman Reuss in Milwaukee Feb. 10 provided a swift glimpse of such " small decisions " and the large cash outlays they entail . " There is a $1.5 billion item for the ABM , " Reuss said of the new budget , " expected ultimately to cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million for AWACS , a new airborne radar system with an ultimate $15 billion price tag . There is almost a billion dollars for continued deployment of the Navy 's new F-14 tighter plane , with an expected total Military Dominance and Technology 's By-Products 227 program cost of up to $36 billion . There is $370 million in the budget for a start on the F-15 , the Air Force 's new superiority jet fighter . Costs of this program are expected to exceed $25 billion . " These programs impose a heavy mortgage on future budgets , but these are among the military commitments blacked out . The budget presentation is shot through with deceit . " For the first time in two full decades , " Nixon boasted in the message , " the Federal government will spend more money on human resource programs than on national defense . " This was illustrated with a pie chart showing 41 cents of the budget dollar going to human resources and only 36 cents to national defense . But if the government 's huge social security and other trust fund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spends 53 cents of every dollar of the general revenues . External Effects and Residuals Production and consumption in a highly industrialized society have side effects , or as the economists call them , " externalities " or " external effects . " External effects may be said to arise when relevant effects on production or welfare go wholly or partially unpriced . Being outside the price system such external effects are sometimes looked upon as byproducts , wanted or unwanted , of other people 's activities that immediately or indirectly affect the welfare of other individuals . ( Mishan , 1965 ) There are many kinds of external effects . External effects can be beneficial ? the liquor store which makes its waste cartons available to the public ; or they can be detrimental ? the soot and smoke produced when waste cartons are incinerated by a store and the soot and smoke is experienced by neighboring property owners . This article will be concerned with the latter , undesirable external effects . Unwanted external effects may be classified according to the stage of the production-consumption process in which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following categories : ( a ) Primary or extractive resulting from production of raw materials , for example , oil contamination of the Santa Barbara Channel of California associated with oil drilling operations . 228 Military Dominance and Technology 's By-Products 229 ( b ) Production or processing resulting from manufacturing , for example , odor associated with Kraft process paper mills . ( c ) Consumption resulting from a consumer 's use of a product , for example , smog resulting from the use of automobiles and gasoline . A consumer 's use of services can also be considered to be part of this category . For example , a person who uses jet air travel is contributing to a noise effect which must be borne involuntarily by others . Here I will focus on the second category of external effects ? production , i.e. , those resulting from manufacturing . There is a variety of undesirable external effects which could be produced by manufacturing , such as noise , odor , urban blight , smoke , and solid and liquid wastes . All of these are serious and deserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type of external effect which has residuals . According to Ayres and Kneese this type of external effect is different from the others because residual matter is produced and dispersed in the environment , and they point out that " technological means for purifying one or another type of waste discharge do not destroy the residuals but only alter their form " ( italics mine ) . Ayres and Kneese critique economic theory by stating : ... we persist in referring to the final consumption of goods as though material objects such as fuels , materials , and finished goods somehow disappeared in the void ? a practice which was comparatively harmless so long as air and water were almost literally free goods . Of course , residuals from both the production and consumption processes remain and they usually render disservices ( like killing fish , increasing the difficulty of water treatment , reducing public health , soiling and deteriorating buildings , etc. ) rather than services . By now we are all familiar with the terms " air pollution " and " water pollution , " but , except for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undesirable , we know little about what is involved . Traditionally , economists have treated air and water as " free goods , " i.e. , resources which one could use without payment , but increased population and economic development have made it increasingly apparent that air and water are finite resources and as the capacity of those resources to dilute and chemically degrade waste products is approached , the resource becomes valuable , by some measure . This happens because in the long run ( 1 ) the residuals persist and ( 2 ) the environment is a closed system . In the short run , the environment has definite carrying capacities at any time : as long as the capacity of air or water to dilute or disperse is not exceeded , conditions are not too bad ; but when exceeded , we have serious " pollution " which may immediately threaten life . In the long run , there is an accumulation of residuals in the environment whether or not air or water is used as a diffuser , degrader or pipeline . All matter will eventually reside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 230 Some Specific Societal Problems and Response to Those Problems entropic processes which diffuse concentrated material ( iron ore is mined , manufactured into steel and iron and eventually diffused in innumerable dumps and fragments of rust over the surface of the earth ) ; and anti-entropic processes which concentrate diffused material ( such as the Dow process , which concentrates the metal magnesium from the limitable resource of the sea ) . The entropic process , which is now prevalent , can not go on forever . Application of space technology , closed system concepts are needed : ... it is quite possible to visualize an earth of the future which has a stable closed system technology dependent upon the atmosphere and the sea as the basic resources from which diffused elements are concentrated and to which concentrations are eventually returned . Man will then be independent of geological capital . The Common Property Concept The distinction between private and public , or common , property rights has important implications for the understanding of how the external effects problems have grown over the years and why no one is really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , traditionally , air and water were considered to be " free goods , " and everyone had a common right to use them without restriction . In order to show what is happening to air and water resources , Garrett Hardin ( 1968 ) has described what happened to land , in a scenario called " the tragedy of the commons , " based on life in old England . He tells about a pasture open to all . Hardin says that each owner of cattle would ask himself what would be the utility to himself of adding one more animal to his herd . After considering the positive component of the utility , his gain in income and the negative component , the overgrazing effect , which would be shared by all herdsmen , he finds that the positive component greatly outweighs the negative component . ... the rational herdsman concludes that the only sensible course for him to pursue is to add another animal to his herd . And another ; and another .... But this is the conclusion reached by every rational herdsman sharing a commons . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a system that compels him to increase his herd without limit ? in a world that is limited . Ruin is the destination toward which all men rush , each pursuing his own best interest in a society that believes in the freedom of the commons . Freedom in a commons brings ruin to all . The commons analogy is valid in the modern world and can be applied to other kinds of " commons , " air and water resources as well as to land resources . External effects are quantitatively negligible in a low-population or economically Military Dominance and Technology 's By-Products 231 underdeveloped setting , but they become progressively more important as the population rises and the level of output increases ( i.e. , as the natural reservoirs of dilution and assimilative capacity become exhausted ) . As long as rational man finds that his share of the cost of the wastes he discharges into the commons is less than the cost of purifying , treating , etc. , before releasing them , he will likely elect to follow the lower cost alternative . In the case of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fencing and thereby limiting the use of land to one individual or a group who will conserve the resource . There is no way to fence off air and water resources , nor is there any way that these can be controlled or owned in the same sense that a government may control or own a road system . Since these resources move around from one area to another they create special problems not present when considering land . When common property is available for use on a no rule basis , so that it may be freely used by anyone for any purpose at any time , it will be overused and , hence deteriorate , just as the common pasture did which was owned by everybody ? and nobody . In Dales ' opinion , Air and water in this country , and in most other countries , have been treated as an unrestricted common property ; so long as they are so treated , air and water pollution will increase and the physical condition of our air and water assets will continue to deteriorate . Individual Decisions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and water ownership and the production process , external effects have not been a problem for private decision-makers . Therefore the true costs of the enterprise are not borne by industrial organization . The rationale of an organization is that its contribution is small compared to the aggregate effect , and being so insignificant , the organization is making only a small contribution to the total problem . Of course all organizations will use the same rationalization , and , on that basis , all will be able to continue to justify what they are doing . Since the rationale for organizational decision-making appears to be primarily economic with first priority given to survival of the organization and not to survival of human beings , it would seem that those who say that external costs should be internalized have an interesting suggestion . Conclusions We are now beginning to observe negative aspects of economic growth and technological progress , but economists continue to act as though the quantitatively measured indicators , " production " and " consumption , " are in themselves adequate indicators of economic success . But , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some Specific Societal Problems and Response to Those Problems concept of our planet as a closed system , economic principles need be made compatible with this concept . Industrial organizations continue to act as though they were operating in an open system in which unlimited growth and technological progress is possible , and in which any negative effects which are generated will be taken care of by the public sector . Since it is unlikely that environmental quality can be maintained in the face of the aggregate of undesirable external effects produced as the exports of organizations , some kind of organizational adaptation is going to be necessary . That necessary adaptation has not yet occurred . The disagreeable smell of hydrogen sulphide comes wafting through the magnificent stands of fir and cedar as a kind of early warning signal . Minutes later the highway leading up the northern shore of the Columbia River from Portland tips over a rise , and one looks down on a fortress-like industrial complex , which is wreathed in billowing clouds of steam and vapors worthy of Dante 's Inferno . This is the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Washington . For years the mill 's smoking stacks and chimneys have spelled jobs , opportunity , and prosperity for a land that a cenutry and a half ago was wilderness ? the chosen habitat of the Chinook Indians . Today that historic era of pioneering is taken more or less for granted . The big question is how and when Crown Zellerbach can produce paper without obscuring the view of distant Mount Hood , or disturbing the life of the Columbia River salmon , or affronting the nostrils of tourists , not to mention the citizens of this part of the Columbia basin . This is a task that Crown Zellerbach is taking seriously , spurred on by multiplying state laws as well as by desire to protect its own corporate reputation as a good neighbor . " We have a big job to do , no question , " says Francis Boylon , president and chief executive officer . If you count it up , Crown Zellerbach is doing quite a bit . Two years ago the company completed a $3-million settling basin on 233 234 Some Specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the Camas waterfront , which screens some 40 million gallons of water per day of their worst woody effluent . Now it is breaking ground for a new $15-million magnefite pulping system , which will recirculate chemicals coming from its sulphite mill . Thereafter it will probably begin to revamp its kraft paper facilities at Camas to reduce their noxious sulphide odor ? an objective already attained at its new mill at Waunak eighty miles down the Columbia , and at its older Port Townsend plant on Puget Sound . In other areas of the country , notably at Bogalusa , Louisiana , Crown Zellerbach still has a considerable cleanup job to do . Yet counting in experimental work now in progress , the company is responding to a new kind of industrial challenge . In doing so , Crown Zellerbach is representative of a much broader trend . In the Northwest there is growing sentiment that just as the lumber industry , after ghastly trial and error , learned how to use the forests without despoiling them , so the paper industry and others can meet the needs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nation , similar sentiments have been emanating from the leaders of the steel industry , the chemical industry , and public utilities . Last year industrial spending to clean up the air and the water , on conservative estimates , forged past the $1-billion mark . Meanwhile the manufacture of antipollution equipment ? giant electrostatic precipitators for reducing dust and smoke , " scrubbers " for catching noxious gases , and plain old-fashioned valves and gates for controlling polluted water ? has become a burgeoning industry in its own right . Companies like Research-Cottrell , Wheelabrator , Zurn Industries , and others have been engaging the attention of Wall Street analysts . On the same day that noted economists were predicting a " serious recession " for the economy as a whole , shares of the antipollution companies led the stock market upward . " Ideas Have Their Time in History " All this is an immensely healthy development , because if the U.S. is to achieve a cleaner environment in the Seventies , industry has a critical role to play . Industry is only one contributor to pollution , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ techniques that can bring pollution under control . " Technology ? not regulations or good intentions or rhetoric ? can preserve our clean water , " says David D. Dominick , commissioner for the Federal Water Pollution Control Administration of the Department of the Interior . " Industrial leadership and political leadership must carry on the battle together . " Yet the battle is a curious and complicated one , and in defining industry 's job it pays to maintain a sense of perspective and realism . " Ideas have their time in history , " says one leading businessman , " and I do n't think we should loose our screws about this thing . " Analysis shows that the No. 1 polluter of the atmosphere is not the smoking factory or steaming chemical plant but the ubiquitous Military Dominance and Technology 's By-Products 235 automobile , which at long last Detroit is trying to equip with antipollution devices whose costs will be borne by the consumer . When it comes to pollution of lakes and rivers , business is by no means the sole offender . Municipalities have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the effluents of industry that they have contracted to handle . If the shad find life uncomfortable in the Delaware River , it is not just because Sun Oil , Scott Paper , and Du Pont discharge wastes into that waterway , but because the citizens of Philadelphia and other cities have preferred all too often to complain about the pollution of the environment , rather than voting the necessary bond issues . More important , it is unrealistic to think that business " leadership , " however well intentioned , can by itself clean up the environment without clear guidelines from government , whose responsibility is to set the framework in which competitive enterprise operates . When a businessman invests in new equipment he at least knows that the resulting product will be paid for by the consumer , and he hopes it will yield a profit . But when he commits money to bettering the environment , he shoulders , on the near term at least , a dead cost ; unless other companies follow suit he will find himself at a competitive disadvantage . This explains why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulations , have welcomed the Water Quality Act of 1965 and the Air Quality Act of 1967 as at least a beginning effort at setting national standards . Says Charles B. McCoy , president of Du Pont : " Everybody would be delighted if Du Pont or some other company could report that it has found a way to turn the expense of pollution control into an asset . " With the present state of technology , he concludes , that just is n't possible . The Rising Curve Once these elementals are understood , industry 's performance is seen to be neither as bad as sometimes made out nor as good as it should be . With respect to cleansing waste water , industry 's expenditures have risen from about $45 million in 1952 to an annual current rate of about $600 million . Expenditures for protecting the atmosphere are somewhat smaller . But these figures do not reflect the full burden that many corporations are assuming . In many cases antipollution devices simply can not be clamped on to existing facilities ; instead whole plants must be redesigned with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Housewife Forced to operate close to the great metropolitan centers , and an obvious target for every housewife who glances out her window , the electric-power companies have moved t o reduce pollution . Increasingly they have installed electrostatic 236 Some Specific Societal Problems and Response to Those Problems precipitators , cyclonic collectors , and wet scrubbers to reduce emission of particulates , and in new plants such installations are now considered routine . Old and middle-aged plants can not be abandoned , given recurrent power shortages and the danger of overloading and blackouts , which enrage the public even more than emission of soot and smoke . Regulation is the only answer , and it is having its effect . Increasingly the power companies find that air-pollution control authorities in Washington and at the municipal level are increasing their costs , in a way that will force the raising of rates . State power commissions are committed to holding rates down . Caught in the middle , utilities have shown considerable ingenuity in shaving operating expenses . Southern California Edison and Arizona Public Service , plus smaller companies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a huge generating station in New Mexico . Advances in technology are also in evidence . Kansas Power &; Light Co. has shown that emissions of sulphur dioxide can be licked even in an old plant by a process devised by Combustion Engineering . Working closely with Pennsylvania Electric and later with Metropolitan Edison , the Monsanto Co. has developed a catalytic oxidation system that turns SO2 into useful sulphuric acid . The cat-ox equipment is expensive , but sale of sulphuric acid can help in amortizing costs . As Monsanto salesmen are fond of pointing out to utilities , Monsanto can help to market this all-purpose byproduct . " Closest to Hell " A breakthrough in curbing sulphur dioxide would not only help the utilities , but also might rescue the steel industry from mounting public criticism . Oxides of sulphur are emitted in large quantities from steel 's coking ovens , and are an old irritant in many a steel town . At its old Clairton works outside of Pittsburgh , U.S. Steel has turned to a cryogenic process that recovers some sixty tons of sulphur daily from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this reduction , the atmosphere around Clairton is far from savory , and last April an Allegheny County commissioner complained that Clairton " is the closest to hell I 've ever been . " The steel industry also emits yellowish dust from its open hearths , and pollutes water with acid wastes from pickling steel as well as other operations . On one estimate the industry uses eight billion gallons of water per day for cooling and other purposes . Despite progress , it still has a considerable distance to go to obtain a clean bill of health . Pittsburgh 's famous Golden Triangle is a kind of island rising from the polluted Allegheny and Monongahela rivers . Still worse is the condition of the Cuyahoga River , which snakes down into Lake Erie at Cleveland . Because of oil slicks and other contaminants , it is known as the " only body of water in North America that is considered a fire hazard . " Yet great and substantial changes are going on , and the lumbering steel giant is bestirring itself . Military Dominance and Technology 's By-Products 237 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter of replacement of the open-hearth process by basic oxygen furnaces . As these are installed , precipitators , scrubbers , and water-treating facilities go with them . As of today , about 50 percent of all steel is produced by this process , and the conversion is bound to continue to meet competition at home , as well as from Europe and from Japan . In this instance technological innovation , which conservationists often blame for pollution , actually help to lessen it . The trouble in steel and metalworking generally is that old plants can not be torn down overnight . Small and marginal companies lack the resources and the cash flow to keep up with multiplying regulation . A case in point is the financial condition of gray-iron foundries , which are usually small independent shops with comparably small resources . " If you apply the same regulations to them as to steel , " ruminates one expert , " three-quarters of them would simply go out of business tomorrow . " That would also have been true in the early days of oil . Initially refineries were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applied to John D. Rockefeller 's first famous still in Cleveland it too would have ignominiously folded to the discomfort of today 's householder who might still be periodically rushing down to the basement to stoke his furnace with smoky coal . The thrust of technology and the rise of the great integrated oil company have changed all that . The oil industry may be held indirectly accountable for the automobile , which is the largest polluter of the atmosphere , but thanks to enormous expenditures ? running last year to over $300 million ? it has made an impressive start in cleaning up its refining operations . Ducks on the Pond and Gulls on the Beach In the San Francisco Bay area , for instance , Standard Oil ( New Jersey ) has loaded its new refinery at Benicia with the latest controls and for good measure has given it an aesthetic exterior . More remarkable has been the success of Standard of California in renovating its Richmond refinery , which nestles close to the city . The original installations here were made as far back as 1902 with little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems of contamination . Yet step by step , and often by small little-noticed improvements , the company has more than met required standards by use of precipitators ; by extracting hydrogen sulphide from its refinery gases before they are reused for combustion ( and selling it to a nearby chemical company ) ; by waging unrelenting war on oil leakages ; and by bulldozing out large oxidation basins where bacteria work on organic wastes and render them harmless before the water is swirled back to the sea . As if to reassure that stern conservationist , the National Audubon Society , lagoons beneath the cracking towers are the favored resting place of all manner of wildlife ? gulls , avocets , godwits , curlews , and ducks . 238 Some Specific Societal Problems and Response to Those Problems Yet live ducks on San Francisco Bay will not quite make up for the dead gulls that strewed the beaches of Santa Barbara last year , as the result of the miscarriage of an offshore drilling operation by Union Oil Co . The great California oil spill has tarnished the industry 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executives because in their opinion it was foreseeable and preventable . They point out that thousands of wells have been sunk off the California and Gulf coasts without mishap . Union Oil , it is felt , stretched the rules of the game by not sinking a well casing deep enough in a notably unstable geologic area ; and the fact that it had permission to do so from the federal government does n't mend matters . Clearly , individual companies will have to tighten up on their own drilling practices if they want to continue to exploit vital reserves . They will also have to cope with tanker spillage and with the threat of disasters such as the one that overtook the Torrey Canyon off the British Isles ? a threat that grows with every increase in the size of tankers . Having made a start on cleaning up its refineries , oil faces a new challenge in production and transportation . Big utility , steel , and oil companies such as we have been considering will for the most part continue to treat their own effluents . But food-processing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are already making large use of municipal water-treating plants . In 1968 about 15 percent of the waste water thrown off by all manufacturing establishments was sluiced into the public sewers of cities and smaller towns , and some 40 percent of the wastes handled by municipalities was industrial in origin . Who 's Paying the Bill ? Far from decrying this private use of public facilities , many engineers believe that it makes sound economic sense if full user charges are exacted . In some areas , notably California , municipal authorities have insisted that smaller factories use their watertreating plants on the grounds that this gives government real control over pollution . What is troubling is that the municipalities , even when duly compensated for handling industry 's wastes , have been lagging behind in meeting their growing responsibilities . Here , calculations made by the Interior Department are revealing . On one set of estimates the Federal Water Pollution Control Administration figures that between 1970 and 1974 industry must invest an additional $3 billion to take care of water effluents treated in its own plants . Since industrial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million per year , industry seems to be just about on target . By contrast , municipalities will have to invest some $10 billion in the same period to take care of rising population and industrial needs . But at present such investment is running to only about $1 billion per year or half of the total amount required annually . Military Dominance and Technology 's By-Products 239 This lag illustrates the fact that while almost everybody wants cleaner water as well as a cleaner atmosphere , there is much less acceptance of the fact that costs must be borne in one way or another . Industry can , and no doubt will , pass on its added costs through higher prices . It can also be helped by special treatment when it comes to amortization of equipment . But in the public sector the need for higher spending and higher taxes is inescapable . Yet the federal government has been most remiss . Washington has been very free with over-all antipollution legislation . It has been skinflint when it comes to voting the hard appropriations for the legislation 's implementation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 29-year-old marketing executive ? visited New York 's Spanish Harlem for the first time . His purpose : to build a low-income housing project . Sucsy lacked both real estate and social work experience . He did have an untested hypothesis : " Business can help solve social problems ? and return a profit to stockholders ? at the same time . " He proved the point and in so doing wrote a new chapter in social-economic history . Sucsy turned an old parking lot into a new apartment house . He moved in 66 families . The result : the first turnkey public housing project in New York . He completed it in 13 months , vs. the 44-month norm via the New York Housing Authority ? at 10% less cost . He turned a 3.5% profit . Winning ushered in a new era in business-social interaction . Sucsy shook The Ghetto . He also surprised The Establishment . Neither will ever be quite the same again . Nor will Sucsy . New York-born Leonard Graham Sucsy comes by business naturally . His father ( a banker ) encouraged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He soon changed direction . " As an economics major , " he relates , " I became aware of marketing as the dynamic heart of business . I wanted to be where the action was . " 244 Some Specific Societal Problems and Response to Those Problems While in college , Sucsy worked summers in marketing departments of Dow Chemical and States Marine Lines . He studied French civilization at the Sorbonne . As a U.S. Naval officer , he held top-secret clearance . He got an MBA from Harvard Business School . In 1967 , Sucsy joined American Standard , New York , as assistant to Victor P. Buell , marketing vice-president . By the following spring Sucsy had started a traditional climb up the ladder . Then everything shifted . " How would you like a completely different kind of job ? " Buell asked him . " We 're thinking about a joint venture with Celanese Corp . We want to build housing in the Ghetto ? at a profit . Want to head up this project ? " Sucsy asked two questions . Would the parent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this commitment ? One convincing answer : Buell already had an option on a housing site . Besides , he promised Sucsy a free hand . In May , 1968 , Sucsy gave Buell his answer : yes . Buell arranged for the incorporation of a joint-venture firm ? called Construction for Progress Inc . As over-all advisor on construction , the joint venture added the know-how of William Lyon Homes , Inc. , Newport Beach , Calif. , an American Standard subsidiary . Sucsy was named CFP executive vice-president and general manager . In careerbuilding , Sucsy had chosen the high-risk , high-gain route . On his new job , Leonard Sucsy inherited an option ? period . Everything else was theory . From May to October , 1968 , he retained architects and contractors , arranged a loan from Chase Manhattan Bank , hammered dozens of East Harlem community groups into agreement . In October , 1968 , construction crews broke ground . In May this year Construction for Progress sold the building to New York City Housing Authority at a profit . Tenants moved in shortly thereafter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did it all happen ? And why ? In 1965 , Columbia University created the Urban Action and Experiment Program . Harold Bell , professor of architecture , was named director . In bettering the urban condition , Bell found much government and community group activity ? but little business participation . Business know-how , he reasoned , was the missing leg of a three-legged stool . Money contributions , alone , would n't do : management expertise was missing . How could Bell stimulate active business participation in urban problems ? In 1967 , Bell attacked the problem frontally . He called a colloquium . He invited major corporations , and delegates from 30 companies attended . Bell explained : " For the most part , U.S. business had expressed deep interest in social good . Management realizes the nation faces problems and that we must solve them . Business also realizes obligations to stockholders . At this meeting , we are seeking a practical way to meet these dual obligations . " Human Injustice 245 When the meeting broke into discussion groups , William A. Bartel , communications and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants to do something meaningful . Not just tokenism , " Bartel told Bell . " How can we get started ? " Had Bartel talked with Victor Buell at American Standard ? No . " Well , you should , " said Bell . " American Standard is thinking along the same lines . Actual housing construction is a real possibility , they feel . " Bell set up a meeting . Buell and Bartel agreed to form a joint venture . Bell volunteered to act as consultant . To prime the pump , Bell selected a possible site in El Barrio ( Spanish Harlem ) at 111th St. and First Ave . He put it under option . " We need a good man to operate this firm on a full-time basis , " Buell told Bartel . " I hate to lose Leonard Sucsy even to this excellent cause . But I 'll see if he wants the job . " Soon Sucsy was setting up a Construction for Progress office in the American Standard building . If social service was the goal , Spanish Harlem was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between 95th and 125th Sts. , Fifth Ave . and the East River . This Manhattan community ? 60% Puerto Rican , 35% Black ? is probably the most densely populated area in the United States . On housing need ? if on few other points ? community groups agree The East Harlem Real Great Society , a community action group , has labeled 50% of East Harlem housing as " deteriorating " and 14% as " dilapidated . " Moveover , only 12 new buildings had been erected in Harlem in the last decade . And , of course , New York 's overall housing need is marked . The city 's waiting list for public housing is rising steadily ? up 11% last year alone . Statistically , then , the need was enormous . Subjectively , it comes across even stronger . On Leonard Sucsy 's first visit to the housing site , he found a land of contrasts . To the north , he saw 1960s-type high-rise apartments built by the city . Structures on three sides , however , were vintage 1930s ? and earlier . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By the number of children playing outside Sucsy suspected ten to 12 families lived in some of the smaller brownstones . His inaugural site in hand , Sucsy came to a fork in the road . Should Construction for Progress build and manage the apartments ? Or build to sell ? Sucsy first examined the market . A full 70% of East Harlem families were rated " poverty-level " by the U.S. government . This 70% was the biggest market and the greatest need . And since the New York City Housing Authority operated a building acquisition program , Sucsy clearly looked to NYCHA as his best prospective customer . Ile also investigated a Federal program called Turnkey . He ended up coupling these two programs together with a unique variation of his own . 246 Some Specific Societal Problems and Response to Those Problems Technically , the government 's Turnkey program is designed to encourage private-sector building . Under the program a local housing authority reviews plans , then gives the developer a firm commitment at a specific price before construction . To finance the project , the local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Authority permission to float bonds . Debt service is covered by an annual contributions contract from HUD 's HAA . But traditional Turnkey would not work for CFP . Here 's why : Wicks Law , a New York State housing statute , requires that Housing Authority construction contracts exceeding $25,000 be let on a sealed bid basis . Furthermore , the law states , bids must provide separate specifications for plumbing and gas fitting ; for heat , hot water , cooling , and air conditioning ; and for wiring and lighting . " These requirements prevented CFP from entering into a firm contract , " Sucsy said . " Wicks Law eliminated the possibility of cost savings through efficient management . As a result , costs ? and time span ? would have been increased considerably . " CFP 's legal counsel suggested a possible solution . Why not build first ? then sell to the Housing Authority ? Since the city would n't own it during construction , state laws would n't apply . Sucsy liked the concept . But his marketing instinct cautioned him not to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the solution that made it work : Handshake Turnkey . Sucsy made this proposal to Albert A. Walsh , chairman of New York City Housing Authority : " CFP will erect a building to suit Housing Authority specifications and HUD financing requirements . The Housing Authority agrees to buy the building , if we deliver informally as specified . However , we sign no agreement . We merely seal the bargain with a handshake . " Walsh favored it . He consulted Herman D. Hillman , HUD 's assistant regional administrator of housing assistance . Another green light . While Handshake Turnkey breathed new life into CFP , it amplified the problem of borrowing money . In May , 1968 , Sucsy approached Chase Manhattan Bank . Even though American Standard and Celanese are both Chase customers , bank officials were leary . Philip Molter of the bank 's real estate department asked terms of the Housing Authority agreement . Sucsy repeated words of NYCHA chairman Walsh : " We say only that we 've seen their plans , and that if the building existed today , we probably ? repeat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicate they would ask . " Molter shook his head . Not much there to comfort a banker . " If we granted t he loan , we 'd be providing a standby commitment to purchase the building if no one else did , " Molter said . Human Injustice 247 Chase agreed to consider it . American Standard and Celanese , as sizeable bank customers , encouraged Molter . Bartel actually visited the bank to urge approval . This helped . Even then , months went by . Sucsy decided to forge ahead . " We had to assume ultimate financing ? from somewhere ? or the entire project was doomed . Since that was our assumption , we moved forward . " Construction crews broke ground October 1 , 1968 . A full month later , with CFP 's limited working capital " dangerously low , " the Chase loan came through . CFP borrowed $800,000 ? 80% of its construction cost ? at 8% annual interest . A 1-1/2% service charge was added , bringing the cost of the loan to 9.5% . Sucsy soon found , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his biggest headaches , that of community relations . A marketing man expects to negotiate with government and banking officials . Sucsy consciously boned up on real estate and construction . But his most surprising and unexpected chore ? Harlem community politics ? almost did him in . At first , he took a common-sense approach : " Let 's find out what organization represents the community . We 'll work with them . " Zot ! He found 16 organizations claiming to represent the community . They agreed on only one point : " community control ! " By conservative estimate , Sucsy has held at least 500 conversations about community control since he first went to Harlem . One group that played a large role was the East Harlem Real Great Society . RGS ( founded by foundation grants ) preps school dropouts , conducts language courses , and works extensively in urban planning . The society explains community control : " East Harlem is an underdeveloped country . Most of it is owned and controlled by private and governmental interests outside the community . In the past , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an essentially powerless community , but it will not continue to do so . " East Harlem is awakening to its rights and abilities for self-control and selfdetermination . The people have become aware , as part of a nationwide movement , that they must control their own environment in order to determine their own future . " Located on three termite-infested floors of an aging building , the society 's 30 suspicious , xenophobic members concentrate on making sure outsiders " do n't screw us over . " Inside , a sign proclaims : " Anyone with drugs on them ? or in them ? is not allowed in this building . " This reflects the view of Harry Quintana , director of the society 's urban planning studio . He blames outsiders for drug addiction in East Harlem . " They perpetuate drug addiction and welfare , " he states baldly . " Because of this , we must have control . " Sucsy decided to open lines of communication with other groups . He asked Columbia University for help . 248 Some Specific Societal Problems and Response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graduate assistant to Bell , put Sucsy together with two community action groups ? the Real Great Society , a Puerto Rican organization , and MEND , a Negro group . They met in a dimly lit bar near Columbia . One delegate toyed with a switchblade knife during the discussion . After subsequent meetings in which he talked with nine different community groups , Sucsy divided opinions into two separate and distinct camps : Faction 1 : " Speed in housing is the most important , even if the city ends as owner . " Faction 2 : " Community control is all-important ? even at loss of speed or increase in cost . " Through these and other experiences , Sucsy became oriented toward community participation , without relinquishing control . In Jim Soler , official of Cooperating Christian Churches , and a middle-of-theroad neighborhood politician , Sucsy found a mediator . Soler helped form a consortium of nine neighborhood groups : the Concerned Citizens for East Harlem . Humberto Cintron was appointed head of it . Aided by Robinson of Columbia , Cintron 's coalition sifted more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screening committee ? one Black , one Puerto Rican , one white ? made the final choices . The committee unanimously recommended one elderly couple ? 40-year residents in the one-time Italian neighborhood . Ethnic battles did develop . Negro groups demanded Blacks dominate choices . Puerto Rican groups held out for Puerto Ricans . A priest with an Italian parish plumped for Italians . Soler accepted the strife stoically : " If Jesus Christ were walking the streets of Harlem today , he 'd meet criticism from all sides . " Soler 's committee finally drew up a compromise list of 126 names . The Housing Authority agreed to choose the final 66 . The Concerned Citizens proved the key to East Harlem community cooperation ? of sorts ? for a brief period . In constructing the apartment building , Sucsy tried to use local suppliers and professionals as far as possible . One community group wanted to specify both contractor and architect . Sucsy 's pointed answer was " no . " However , CFP did schedule community participation throughout . Max Bond , former executive director of Architects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did Nathan Smith , another community resident . CFP retained a non-Harlem architectural firm , Wechsler and Schimenti . Sucsy considered a Harlem-based construction firm . He called it off when the builder insisted on a cost-plus contract . " That 's giving a man a blank check . We could n't do that . " Human Injustice 249 He finally settled on Valridge Construction Co. , non-Harlem . Philip Rosen , Valridge president , was instrumental in arranging minority representation on the construction crews . A Puerto Rican , Felix LaSalde , was signed as foreman . Approximately 40% of construction workers were either Black or Puerto Rican . In solving CFP 's multi-problems , Sucsy gives major credit to two management aides ? Frank McMorrow and Paul Meaghar . McMorrow , on the CEP executive staff , supervised construction and costaccounting details . Meaghar , a former NYCHA staff member , served as governmental advisor . McMorrow 's old-shoe approach , for instance , was ideal in talking construction with construction men . And Meaghar , in talking with government officials , was immediately accepted as a member of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ management counsel throughout was a key factor in CFP success . These combined abilities produced a salable product . By May of 1969 , construction was complete on an unpretentious six-story elevator building called " 335 East 111 St. " The building 's divided brick facade blended with the brownstone row-house neighborhood . Except for street number , the building carried no identifying public housing label . Apartments range from one- to four-bedroom units . Time for the final test : would the Housing Authority buy it ? CFP set the price at $1,200,000 . This price , approximately 10% lower than if built by the authority , resulted from savings in three areas : 1 . Bank funds were not drawn until bills came in from suppliers . Since construction took only 7-1/2 months , CFP paid only a few months ' interest on most of its loan . 2 . Due to construction speed , CFP paid property taxes for only one year . 3 . CFP 's single contractor operated more efficiently than the multi-contractor arrangement required by Wicks Law . " At the same time , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compactor , and 6,000-sq. ft. community space ? at extra cost , " Sucsy says . City inspectors examined the building . Soon Sucsy had a Certificate of Occupancy ( a document stating the building meets city living standards ) . He presented the certificate ? along with final plans and specifications ? to Chairman Walsh . He waited . In a few days , " We 'll buy , " a Walsh aid reported . Tenants moved in this June . The first low-income turnkey housing project was in operation . Actually , the city saved money . The final purchase price averaged $18,000 per unit compared to $25,000 per unit of New York typical public housing , Columbia 's Bell pointed out . Was the city happy ? Grace Bliss , assistant to Walsh , states : " We think we got a favorable price and the building was put up much faster than we could have put up a building of the same size on the same kind of site . " 250 Some Specific Societal Problems and Response to Those Problems The Housing Authority , working under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months to complete construction , Miss Bliss estimates . Traditional turnkey ? advance contract instead of handshake ? would have required 21 to 24 months to complete . Rents average $18 per room . If the Housing Authority 's approval was clear-cut , community reaction in East Harlem balanced it out . Community reaction was ? and is ? negative . To counter attacks , Sucsy relies on human relations . Connie Rodriguez , a Puerto Rican staffer at CFP , is frequently dispatched door-to-door . She talks to tenants in English or Spanish , as they prefer . This develops good rapport . CFP continues tenant liaison even though the building is Housing Authority property . Soon , for example , Sucsy is planning to conduct home economics courses in the building as a tenant benefit . These courses will be rotated to other CFP buildings later . " We are not walking away from our buildings , " Sucsy says . " We 've made that clear to everyone . " This brand of community relations counters many negative comments . What are future plans at CFP ? Whither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CFP 's new housing projects ? 11 in all ? will account for 1,000 units by mid-year 1970 . Leonard Sucsy projects 2,000 units , or $40 million worth of business , by end of 1970 . On future projects , he expects to equal , or exceed , the inaugural building 's 3.5% profit . Two CFP South Bronx projects are already under construction . CFP will be expanding nationally . Sucsy considers all 50 states fair game . The CFP techniques , Sucsy points out , are adaptable to any U.S. area where low-income housing is needed if ? repeat if ? project management understands the local political and community environment . In reporting on CFP to stockholders , Celanese Corp . said : " The aim of Construction for Progress is not to take Celanese into commercial building . Rather it is to demonstrate how private enterprise can apply financial and managerial resources to solve slum housing problems while providing stockholders a reasonable return on assets employed . " Sucsy sees fewer problems as more firms enter the field . " What the U.S. really needs is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he states . " We have this identity , for example , in the Conquest of Space . Everyone works together to solve the problem . We do n't have this identity on the social front ? yet . We must develop it before we make effective progress . " An Identity of Interests will require change in government , business , and community , Sucsy attests . " In the past , business has merely skimmed the surface of social need ? and taken credit for doing much more . Government has been overly oriented toward control ? not geared to results and achievement . Community leaders are all too Human Injustice 251 often ? interested in personal power and pressing idealogical points at expense of genuine accomplishment . Each group must change . " Where is the catalyst to spur this change ? Sucsy recommends the professional marketer . " Who better ? " he asks . " The business-to-business marketer has a proved record of getting things done ? on time . He 's trained in persuasion and communications ? two indispensable elements . He 's people-oriented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and government , for example ) . " The marketer relates effectively other fields ? legal , construction , accounting , social ? because he 's a generalist . Relating to others is part of his training . Any business executive who enters the business-social swim must be a quick-study in many areas . But , on balance , the marketer has the best chance to succeed . " The marketing executive who directs a social-business project in a disadvantaged urban area must be prepared for an entirely new world . To profit from Construction for Progress ' definitive experience , consider these guidelines , compiled by Leonard G. Sucsy , CFP chief operating officer . Sucsy applies these calipers to full-scope corporate participation ? not philanthropy . Although CFP was formed to provide low-income housing , Sucsy believes the techniques apply to other business-social activities as well . His advice : Do n't add social responsibilities to work of existing personnel . An ambitious social project requires its own full-time staff . Construction for Progress , for example , operates autonomously from its parent firms . In assigning personnel to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Both the real estate man and the social worker , for instance , would have been wrong for Construction for Progress . ( The marketer ? with his background in communication and persuasion ? is often a good candidate . However , he ca n't expect to write the order and go home . ) Characteristics required : objectivity , people-orientation , boldness , persistence ? plus high frustration tolerance . Sure , you 're making major contributions to serious needs . But do n't expect to be loved ? or even appreciated . Most community groups will be critical . Government 252 Human Injustice 253 agencies want to do it differently . You 'll be obstructed during and scored afterward . The sooner you learn to live with this , the better . " Community control " is the watchword for most community groups . In implementing both business and social objectives , you 'll never please them entirely . ( 100% community control : give them the money ? they take it from there . ) Expect constant flak about community control . Decide how far you can go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line . Remember , you 'll find reams of information ? from government and other sources ? on real estate and construction . But you 'll find little ( if any ) on interaction with the community ? probably your biggest problem . In community relations , you chart your own course . Do n't try to apply logic in disadvantaged areas . In Harlem , community groups dedicated to housing improvement were the biggest roadblocks to Construction for Progress . Rather than viewing the over-all good , most local groups concentrate on parochial needs and power-building . Establish your operating procedure goals early in the game . When you present plans to community groups , expect opposition . Listen to objections . Accept practical suggestions . But do n't permit changes to thwart business objectives . If you try to please everyone , you 'll end up not pleasing anyone . When you enter this kind of project , you 're automatically in politics . If you can not adjust to politics as a daily way-of-life , you 're not the man for this job . Your company , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including being picketed . If you ca n't stand the heat , stay out of the kitchen . All politicians ( and this now includes you ) must develop a power base . You 're sure to develop enemies . Counterbalance with powerful friends , too . Take a tip from the professional politician : every vote counts . Utilize community suppliers as much as possible . But hew to the line on performance . CFP , for instance , employed a Black architectural consultant and community advisers in several areas . ( On the other hand , a Black builder was not retained due to cost-plus contract requirements ? which CFP considered not economic ) . CFP also uses Puerto Rican personnel as liaison with tenants . Retain expert outside legal counsel at the outset . Socially oriented areas are rife with government red tape . You 'll need professional assistance in unraveling architectural and legal skeins . Next , cross-check outside opinion with inside attorneys . Do n't rely on one source ? no matter how authoritative . Expect legal problems . Laws are geared to government control , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other . Present laws make business participation in urban affairs difficult . Be prepared for this . Reforms are much needed in this area . More business involvement ? and protests about restrictive legislation ? will help bring changes . You 're in the People Business . Staff studies and corporate structures do not apply . You must be on the human firing line daily . Every step forward requires 254 Some Specific Societal Problems and Response to Those Problems help from individuals in the community . If you can not get things done through people ? often facing heavy resistance ? this is n't your bag . " Meaningful dialog " may be a cliche in Washington . But it 's a workable motto for good community relations . Keep two-way lines of communications open . Keep talking . Keep listening . Once involved with community relations , forget about regular office hours . Community groups are likely to meet during evening hours . You 'll need to attend to sell , explain , justify , defend your project . Your company 's community reputation is your most valuable asset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every action must be above reproach . Be accessible to all community groups . Do n't become identified with any one . Project this identity : fair-minded , open-minded , tough-minded ? in meeting both business and social obligations . Plan a continuing community relationship after your project is complete to obviate charges of exploitation . ( Construction for Progress , for instance , is conducting home economics courses for tenants in its East Harlem building . ) Fight outdated government rules . Regulations of government bureaus frequently remain in force after the original purpose is gone . When this happens , protest . Government responds to how much people want something and how loudly they want it . In the initial CFP building , Housing Authority rules required space in each apartment for a washing machine ? despite central laundry facilities in the basement . This regulation ? along with dozens of others ? must be scrapped . Work for better laws . Existing laws were not designed to encourage business participation in social projects . This must change . The more companies which protest , the sooner the change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Law is a problem . ( The situation in each state will differ , of course . Massachusetts , for example , has a law similar to Wicks Law . ) Why is such restrictive legislation still on the books ? Craft unions support Wicks Law to insure job security . Other vested interests defend traditional construction techniques . The greater good suffers . Balance your two sets of objectives : business and social . If you can not meet business objectives , you can not finance social objectives . When community pressures push you too far , fold up and leave . This is your last resort , of course . He 's Busy Lifting a City 's Face Meeting William H. Wendel is a little like seeing his neighboring Niagara Falls for the first time ? rather more than you bargained for .

A graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy , Wendel spent seven years in the Navy , joined Carborundum in 1947 as assistant to the president , and moved up to the top spot in 1962 . He quickly won a reputation , both at Carborundum and in civic affairs , as a man who relished broader , long-range strategy more than narrow , tight control . " American industry , " Wendel says , " is turning more and more to management by objectives , to the qualification of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a city that is finally on target . Style-Setter in Equal Opportunity Walter Haas , Jr. , president of Levi Strauss &; Co. , always gets a little miffed when someone singles out his company for its good works in the ghetto . " We are doing much , " he admits , " and we can and will do more . But instead of being the good example , we would much rather be only one of an overwhelming majority doing what should and must be done . " Yet an example his company remains . After the Detroit riots and the formation of the National Alliance of Businessmen , President Johnson appointed Haas as one of eight regional chairmen to help head the NAB 's nationwide ghetto job program . Last April , a Harvard alumni group named Haas " business statesman of the year . " And this week , Levi Strauss &; Co. received one of two Business Week citizenship awards in recognition of its efforts in " human resources . " For a company that once labeled its popular blue-denim " Levis " as " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long way . Years before it was legally required , Strauss promoted equal opportunity at both its San Francisco headquarters and its 30 plants scattered mainly through the South . After his appointment as an NAB regional chairman , Haas further pledged to hire at least 5% of his company 's new employees from among the hardcore unemployed , and set up special training programs that raised their retention rate to 70% ? comparable to that of regular employees . Strauss also hired and upgraded minority group members for supervisory and managerial positions . Today , some 10% of the company 's 1,000 supervisory and managerial employees come from minority groups . " These are not top-level positions , at least not yet , " Haas stresses . Human Injustice 257 " But they are positions in supervision and management , and they can be steps up the ladder . " At the same time , Strauss has helped set up eight minority-owned clothing stores , and is providing long-term credit to nine stores , as part of a $20-million credit pool organized by Phillips-Van Heusen Corp . and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is getting credit help is Rufus Butler , owner of Mister B 's Men 's Shop in Portland , Ore . " I wrote ' em , " Butler told a reporter , speaking of Strauss , " that I did n't know what extended credit was but that we sure needed it . Next thing , their local Levi Strauss man was here saying if he did n't do business with me , his boss would probably fire him . " A Lift for Black Businessmen Bert Daigre is a black capitalist who has made it . A graduate of Northwestern University , Daigre owns a fleet of 30 taxicabs in Chicago and operates an auto garage and insurance company . But he is a rare exception . " Less than 1% of U.S. businesses are owned by Negroes , despite the fact that we make up 17% of the population , " he says . " It has also been shown that 97% of the money spent in Negro ghettos goes out of the community . " To help restore the ghetto 's balance of payments , Western Electric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ System and recipient of one of this year 's two Business Week citizenship awards for " human resources , " has launched an unusual program for giving the minority businessman a lift . Like many other companies , Western Electric took the plunge right after the Detroit riots . " With facilities in 30 states and a purchasing function that deals with 47,000 suppliers in 50 states , " says William G. Chaffee , vice-president of Western Electric , " we felt we were in a unique position to help the minority businessman . " To start things off , Western Electric signed the first of $60,000 worth of contracts with Watts Mfg . Co. , a black-managed subsidiary of Aerojet-General Corp . and producer of various types of canvas products . Since then , Western Electric has lined up 70 other minority suppliers in a dozen cities , often providing management and technical assistance , training , and sometimes start-up capital . To help such suppliers broaden their base , the company also sponsored ? along with several local groups ? three suppliers ' fairs just for black businessmen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The latest , held in Chicago 's International Amphitheatre in September , drew 510 black suppliers and purchasing agents from 148 companies representing more than $100-million worth of annual purchasing power in the Chicago area . Cecil Carmickle , who operates a building and remodeling company in Chicago , is typical of the suppliers who flocked in . " There is a lot of small contracting work to 258 Some Specific Societal Problems and Response to Those Problems be done , " he notes . The problem is making that first big important contact . " If you do n't know anyone , " he asks , " how do you get in ? " All told , the three fairs resulted in more than $1-million worth of contracts . A Mine that Works with the Landscape There comes a time when every red-blooded American male is tempted , in H. L. Mencken 's words , " to spit on his hands , hoist the black flag , and begin slitting throats . " Many conservationists feel that way today . " In years past when we had a problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Colorado Open Space Foundation , " we tried to settle it over a conference table ; then if that failed we brought pressure , and if that failed we went to court . Now many groups start out assuming that business wo n't cooperate , and they are increasingly going straight to court . " One company that is cooperating ? and to an almost unrivaled degree ? is American Metal Climax , Inc. , a $600-million natural resources developer and the recipient of one of two Business Week citizenship awards in the " physical environment " area . Working closely with the Colorado Open Space Foundation , a large private conservation group , AMAX has launched a unique " Experiment in Ecology " at its new $200-million Henderson molybdenum mine high in the Colorado Rockies 50 miles west of Denver . To avoid the usual drab appearance of mining installations , the buildings are being designed with colored siding to match the surroundings . Access roads have been rerouted to preserve as many trees as possible . Some 6,000 acres of woodland have been thrown open for hunting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the environment , however , is its system for handling " tailing " ? finely ground ore waste that leaves the mill in the form of 60% water and 40% solid material . For convenience , tailing is normally stored in ponds near the mine . At Henderson , that would have put it within a short eagle 's glide of a major highway . So AMAX engineers are tunneling 9.3 miles through Red Mountain , building a 13-mile railroad at a cost of $25-million , and putting their mill and tailing pond far from the public 's ? and conservationists ' ? view . Dr. Beatrice Willard , an ecologist and one of the foundation 's more militant members , is impressed with results thus far . But she feels there are still several matters to be ironed out . " I want to do considerably more research on wind patterns around the tailing pond , " she says . " If wind lifts the tailing into the air and drops it on plants , we can have all kinds of problems . " Whatever her research shows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ? AMAX already knows which way the wind is blowing . Human Injustice 259 Master Builder of a Model City " The problem of the city , " says James Rouse , his eyes twinkling with excitement , " is not just congestion , pollution , deterioration ? nor crime , disease , and rats ; nor housing , nor unemployment . It is all of these , of course , but underlying all these conditions are the questions : How did it happen ? How did the city get this way ? What causes our cities to rot away physically and socially ? " As president of Rouse Co. and a highly successful mortgage banker and master builder , Rouse is now trying to answer his own questions . On 14,000 acres of Maryland countryside midway between Baltimore and Washington , Rouse Co. ? recipient of one of two Business Week citizenship awards for " physical environment " ? is buidling a self-contained model city called Columbia , on the thesis that the problems of today 's city are not so much social or economic , as environmental . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handy shopping , a full range of cultural and recreational activities , and such unusual urban amenities as 3,000 acres of forest , five lakes , and 26 miles of riding trails . By creating an environment that " serves , rather than dictates , " Rouse hopes to reestablish vital urban inter-relationships that most other cities smother or destroy . " Think how a good neighborhood environment might affect education , " he rhapsodizes , " and how education , in turn , could affect the development of skills , and how job-training resources in a good neighborhood could influence new employment opportunities . Think how health education and preventive medicine might work its way out into the people from neighborhood health and activity centers , how this might reduce critical illness , loss of time at work , and thus increase individual incomes , sense of well being , human effectiveness . And think how all of this together might affect educability , employability , growth of the person , the family . " Some three years after Rouse Co. turned its first earth in Columbia , the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 83 businesses have acquired space in Columbia , developers have bought land for 4,600 dwelling units , and the city 's population itself is above 5,000 ? on its way to a projected 100,000 by 1980 . The Nation has not reversed the movement apart . Blacks and whites remain deeply divided in their perceptions and experiences of American society . The deepening of concern about conditions in the slums and ghettos on the part of some white persons and institutions has been counterbalanced ? perhaps overbalanced ? by a deepening of aversion and resistance on the part of others . The mood of the blacks , wherever it stands precisely in the spectrum between militancy and submission , is not moving in the direction of patience . The black neighborhoods in the cities remain slums , marked by poverty and decay ; they remain ghettos , marked by racial concentration and confinement . The nation has not yet made available ? to the cities or the blacks themselves ? the resources to improve these neighborhoods enough to make a significant change in their residents ' lives . Nor has it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Neither has the nation made a choice among the alternative futures described by the Commission , which is the same as choosing what the Commission called " present policies . " The present policies alternative , the Commission said , " may well involve changes in many social and economic programs ? but not enough to produce fundamental alterations in the key factors of Negro concentration , racial segregation , and the lack of sufficient enrichment to arrest the decay of deprived neighborhoods.
