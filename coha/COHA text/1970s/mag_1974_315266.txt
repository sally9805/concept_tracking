SLAYRIDE <P> by DICK FRANCIS 219 pages . Harper &; Row . $5.95 . <P> What is the best kind of book to read while waiting in line for a ration of gasoline ? Poetry requires an atmosphere of reverential calm not found among a herd of tethered horsepower ; humor is not likely to be funny enough to offset a stalled driver 's realization that he is the butt of a Third World joke ; the novel of ideas requires too much concentration . An unpretentious , skillfully written detective novel , however , seems ideally suited to the anxious occasion . Aside from the undemanding carrot-and-stick mechanics of the plot , the clever mystery is likely to offer an empathetic situation . Both reader and detective are searching for the guilty party who has caused them considerable inconvenience . <P> In his latest mystery , England 's writing jockey ( Dead Cert , Nerve ) Dick Francis introduces a hero who thrives on inconvenience . David Cleveland , 33-year-old investigator for the English Jockey Club , must begin his case by swimming two miles to shore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cleveland holds a psychology degree from Cambridge and also appears to have taken a correspondence course at the Colombo College of Investigation . " I do n't often look for things , " says Cleveland , " I look at what 's there . " <P> Author Francis complements his sleuth 's leisurely pace by sending him to easygoing Norway where " Takk " means " Thank you " and the residents seem to have perfected the art of being genuinely friendly and remote at the same time . Alas , Cleveland is not a sociologist . His business in Norway is to investigate the disappearance of an English steeplechase jockey named Bob Sherman . The rider is suspected of having absconded with 16,000 kroner ( about $2,800 ) in track receipts-an amount that does not seem worth the cost of ruining a promising career . This reasonable conclusion is confirmed when Sherman 's body is discovered in the hedges behind the grandstand . Cleveland demonstrates considerable compassion and ingenuity when he consoles Sherman 's pregnant widow and foils a number of assassination attempts by a pair of Norwegian hit men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . <P> The author overrides such hurdles of disbelief by demonstrating his jockey 's instinct for making the right move at the right time . For a wonder , Francis does not include his usual horse race in Slayride . The book , in fact , is not about horse racing but about the international oil business . Cleveland discovers that the dead jockey has been used and discarded in a corporate espionage plot involving information about North Sea oil deposits . About the same time ( Francis is a brisk writer ) , the reader may discover that the needle of his fuel gauge is shivering on " Empty " and that petroleum may indeed be worth killing for . <P> R.Z.
