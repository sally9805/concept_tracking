Its unsavory reputation may be changing <P> The scene in which Actor Jack Nicholson receives an electric shock treatment in the 1975 film One Flew Over the Cuckoo 's Nest reinforced the notion that shock therapy is a cruel and barbaric anachronism . Partially as a result of the movie , the popular image of electric shock , which had been steadily fading in the U.S. , grew even dimmer . Now shock treatment is regaining popularity , defended by many psychiatrists as a safe , humane and often dramatically effective method for treating some forms of mental illness , particularly depression . <P> Electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT ) dates back to 1938 , when Italian Psychiatrists Ugo Cerletti and Lucio Bini , searching for a treatment for schizophrenia , used electricity to induce convulsions in a disturbed patient . Afterward , his condition improved . In the ensuing years , ECT became a common treatment for severe psychotic illnesses , both in Europe and the U.S. <P> With the introduction of strikingly effective antipsychotic drugs such as chlorpromazine and imipramine in the 1950s , the popularity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by growing worry about the safety and efficacy of ECT and by charges that it was being used excessively and indiscriminately in institutions that were little more than " shock mills . " Between 1972 and 1977 in New York State , for example , use of ECT dropped by 38% . Across the nation , according to a 1978 report by the American Psychiatric Association , one-third of psychiatrists have reservations about the practice . <P> But dropping ECT apparently leaves a gap in the psychiatric arsenal . Neither psychotherapy nor medication seems to help 20% to 30% of people with extreme depression-those who suffer excessive weight loss , insomnia , loss of sex drive and energy , or threaten or attempt suicide . Other patients , for example , the elderly or those with heart conditions , can not tolerate the medications . Drugs also tend to act more slowly and sometimes produce unpleasant side effects , notably tardive dyskinesia , uncontrollable facial and body contortions caused by lengthy use of antipsychotics . Says Dr. Stuart Yudofsky of the New York State Psychiatric Institute : " I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electric company . <P> But 80% of the depressions that do not respond to drugs do respond to convulsive therapy . " <P> Proponents of ECT also point out that modern techniques are far removed from the horror of Cuckoo 's Nest . Says Yudofsky , " The only way you physically know a seizure is taking place is that sometimes you see a finger wiggling slightly . " The patient is injected with a short-acting anesthetic , then a muscle relaxant to prevent the sudden muscular contractions that in the past occasionally caused fractured bones or chipped teeth . An electrocardiogram is sometimes used to monitor the heart rhythm and oxygen is administered to prevent possible brain damage after the shock .
