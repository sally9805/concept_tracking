" Well , Orion is finally here , Houston . Fahn-taah-stick ! " <P> As Charles Duke 's jubilant Southern drawl crackled across 240,000 miles of space last week , all the world breathed a sigh of relief . After a nerve-racking delay of nearly six hours , during which NASA officials came close to calling off Apollo 16 's lunar landing , Astronauts Duke and John Young had brought the landing craft Orion to a nearly perfect touchdown only 200 yards off target in the moon 's mountain-ringed Descartes region . It was man 's fifth successful landing on the lunar surface , and the first in the highlands , the moon 's oldest and most rugged terrain . <P> While Astronaut Ken Mattingly orbited overhead in the command module Casper , Duke and Young stared out their cabin window onto the sundrenched Cayley Plains . Near their spacecraft , they excitedly reported to scientists back in Mission Control , was a large variety of rocks and boulders , some as big as 10 ft. across , glistening in shades of white and pink and gray . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hatch and we 've got plenty of rocks , " exclaimed Duke . The astronauts also reported brilliantly gleaming ray patterns - splashes of material gouged from the moon 's interior by meteorite impacts - and telltale layering on the face of a hillside to the south . " Man , it really looks nice out there , " said Duke . " I 'm like a little kid on Christmas Eve . " <P> For a while , it had seemed that Christmas would never come . For Apollo 16 had suffered more than its share of worrisome glitches on its way to the moon . First , there were minor troubles - the mysterious flickering of a computer warning light , the mid-flight peeling of protective paint off the lunar module and the recalcitrant zipper on Young 's space suit . Then , after the Apollo had gone into orbit around the moon and Orion , with Duke and Young aboard , had separated from Casper , came real cause for alarm . <P> As the two spacecraft emerged from behind the moon at the beginning of their 13th lunar revolution , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a steering motor controlling Casper 's bell-shaped engine nozzle during firings was swiveling the nozzle erratically back and forth-and Mattingly could do nothing about it . The astronauts were in no immediate danger , but under mission rules the command module 's primary and secondary guidance systems must both be operational before a lunar landing can be attempted . The reason : if the command ship 's engine can not be controlled , the rocket power of the lunar lander is necessary to get the reunited ships back to earth . In fact , that so-called " life raft mode " was used to bring home the stricken Apollo 13 spacecraft two years ago .
