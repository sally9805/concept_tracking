txt WASHINGTON  --  The U . S . Supreme Court ruled unconstitutional Tuesday a Pennsylvania law subjecting physicians ? who perform abortions to criminal penalties if they fail to try to preserve the life of any viable fetus . Dividing 6 to 3 , the court held that the law , which also required doctors to use the abortion technique best suited to preserving the life of a viable fetus , was illegally vague and restrictive . Justice Harry Blackmun , writing for the majority , concluded that the law failed " to inform the physician when his duty to the fetus arises " and to make A Northbrook woman is confident that the U. S. Supreme Court will rule she can sue two Chicago medical schools for sex discrimination . Page 5. " the physician 's good faith determination of viability conclusive . " THE DECISION REAFFIRMED the right of the attending physician to determine at what point there is a reasonable likelihood a fetus can survive outside the womb , with or without artificial support .

Futhermore , the court said that the law was vague because it subjected physicians to potential criminal liability without regard to fault . " The perils of strict criminal liability are particularly acute here because of , // High court lifts penalties for doctors doing abortions // . the uncertainty of the viability determination itself , " Blackmun said .

" - IN ANOTHER ruling Tuesday , the court struck down a Missouri law providing an automatic exemption from jury duty for women who do not want to serve . Justice White , who delivered the court 's opinion , held that this exclusion violates a defendant 's constitutional right to be tried by a jury chosen from a fair cross section of the community . At issue in the appeal was the firstdegree murder and robbery conviction of Billy Duren by a Kansas City jury of 12 men . Duren had sought a new trial because of the absence of women from his jury and because only 5 women were in the pool of 53 persons from which the jury was selected . The high court agreed ' with Duren that jury pools which average about 15 per cent women do not reasonably represent a community where over half the adults are women .
