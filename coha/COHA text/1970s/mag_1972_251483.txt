When the police sent a 17-year-old girl tricked out with a hidden radio into the home of Literary Critic Leslie Fiedler , they heard enough talk about marijuana , they said , to have reason to move in and arrest half a dozen people . Two of Fiedler 's sons , a daughter-in-law and two other young men pleaded guilty to possession of pot ; they received fines or were placed on probation . Fiedler and his wife were convicted in 1970 of maintaining premises where marijuana was used ; he got six months and she was fined $500 . <P> A professor of English at the State University of New York at Buffalo , Fiedler subsequently wrote a scathing memoir entitled Being Busted , in which he blamed the raid largely on the fact that he had sponsored a campus group that advocated legalizing marijuana . As attitudes toward marijuana laws eased , he recalls , " I kept thinking that if I went to jail it would be grotesque , even comic . " He had no lack of grounds for appeal-the girl spy repeatedly changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least questionable-but when New York 's highest court struck down the conviction last week , it offered a more basic reason : " No crime was charged or proven . " <P> The law banning the maintenance of a premises for use of marijuana applies only to a building that the owners specifically maintain for criminal purposes , said Judge James Gibson for the 5-to-2 majority . " It was never'contemplated that the criminal taint would attach to a family home should members of the family on one occasion smoke marijuana or hashish there . " <P> Fiedler 's troubles have cost him a lectureship , credit troubles , and $20,000 in legal fees , but he has just published a book on Shakespeare and been presented with a new grandchild , so he feels philosophic . He hopes that the decision will lead " in an educational way " to a loosening of marijuana laws .
